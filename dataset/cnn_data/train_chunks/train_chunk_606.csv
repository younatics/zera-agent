A baby and a toddler were found dead after their mother put them both in the shower and fell asleep, an inquest heard today. Miranda Hebble, who was 22 at the time of the tragedy, left her sons Lochlan and Malachi Stevens in the steam-filled bathroom at their house in Perth, Australia, for ten hours after she passed out. When she woke up she discovered ten-month-old Malachi floating in the shower on his side with bruises on his cheek while Lochlan, two, was lying on the floor with blood coming from his mouth. He also had a scratch on his forehead and a mark on his stomach, the court was told. Miranda Hebble and her baby son Malachi: She was . at court in Perth today for the inquest into the death of Malachi and . his brother Lochlan, who both died after she apparently left them in the . shower and fell asleep . Left to cope alone: The boys with their father, . Christopher Stevens, who was working on a 'fly-in fly-out' basis, when . the incident occurred. An inquest heard Ms Hebble had been left . exhausted by the children . Ms Hebble had been caring for the boys at home alone while their father, Christopher Stevens, was working on a fly-in fly-out basis, the Australian Associated Press reported. Lochlan had smeared faeces from his nappy on floors, walls and the baby's cot, spurring her to put the boys in the shower to clean them up. She left to fetch something, closing the bathroom door behind her, but fell asleep before she could return, the inquest was told. When she returned to the bathroom, some ten hours later, both children were dead. Ms Hebble told an emergency services operator: 'I passed out and the plug in the shower got plugged up ... and the shower filled up ... and they're not breathing. They're dead.' Doctors pronounced both boys dead at 2am the following morning. Tragic: Lochlan, left, was two when he died. His younger brother Malachi was aged just ten months . Lochlan feeds his baby brother Malachi: The . inquest heard how 'quiet' Ms Hebble had no history of mental illness or . drug and alcohol abuse, but that she'd been struggling with sleep . because of Malachi's restlessness . Kate Ellson, counsel assisting the West Australia coroner, told the court that 'quiet' Ms Hebble had no history of mental illness or drug . and alcohol abuse. But she added that the young mother had struggled with sleep because of Malachi's restlessness. The court also heard of a previous incident when Ms Hebble had . left Malachi in a car while visiting a shop and the baby had to be . pulled hot, crying and red in the face from the vehicle by police. Post-mortem examinations could not reach a definitive conclusion as to how Ms Hebble's sons died in November 2008. Drowning may have caused Malachi's death while Lochlan may have suffered exhaustion, hunger and possible hypothermia with exposure, said forensic pathologist Dr Jodi White. Ms Hebble was comforted by family members as she watched proceedings. She and boys' father have now separated. The inquest continues.","Miranda Hebble had been left exhausted by her youngest child's sleeplessness, inquest hears .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:19 EST, 29 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:27 EST, 29 May 2013 . An international appeal has been issued to companies who can save the Houses of Parliament from collapse. Bids are being invited from specialist heritage firms to draw up plans for the £1billion restoration of the Palace of Westminster. The historic building on the banks of the River Thames is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous landmarks in the world. Restoration: A bidding process has been launched for firms to take on the job of rescuing the Houses of Parliament . Specialist companies are now being sought to find a way to carry out extensive work to repair the building, without distributing the process of British politics. However, MPs and peers could be told to pack their bags and leave the site for up to two years, instead holding debates and votes in a temporary Parliament elsewhere. Parliament officials have launched a bidding process for the restoration and renewal of the Palace of Westminster. A spokesman said: ‘The successful bidder will be tasked with examining the costs, benefits, risks and general feasibility of three possible approaches to the restoration and renewal of the Palace.’ One option is for 'make do and mend' repairs to be carried out over an ‘indefinite period’ while a second option is for ‘a defined, rolling programme of more substantial interventions’ which would take place with MPs and peers still around. Here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the Houses of Parliament to prevent a ‘looming crisis’: . ASBESTOSThe walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the Palace at risk. ELECTRICSMuch of the building needs re-wiring, and generators do not produce enough power . VENTILLATIONMany original shafts are filled with wires, and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable. HEATINGMany . boilers date from the 1930s, pipes are clogged with limescale and are . in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could . close the Commons chamber for months . FLOODINGFfaulty . guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding, and the Big Ben . belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration. Walls are . damp and stained. LEAKY ROOFSA problem throughout the Palace, particularly as cast-iron roofs are coming to the end of their life. DANGEROUS CEILINGSSeveral . pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth-century roof of Westminster . Hall every year, while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the . House of Lords chamber . DRAINAGE Pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected. FIRE SAFETYOut of date alarms and automatic detection systems; little ‘compartmentation’ meaning fire can spread easily. LIFTSOldest lift dates from 1893, several contain obsolete components. Only nine compliant with building regulations. SUBSIDENCEAlthough . the report did not consider this, another problem is that the Palace is . sinking into the Thames, with Big Ben already leaning 18 inches. But it is thought the most likely option is to schedule the works ‘over a more concentrated period with parliamentary activities moved elsewhere and unfettered access to the Palace for the delivery of the works’. The tender was published in the Official Journal of the European Union yesterday. Bids are due to be submitted by June 14. Last year MPs suggested moving the Commons to Birmingham or the Olympic Village in East London. However it had been thought that if MPs did vacate the famous green benches it would be to a site nearby, possibly in the shadow of the Big Ben clock tower or across the road the QE2 conference centre. The bidding process sets out the ‘essential requirement that Parliament must be able to continue its work uninterrupted at all times’. MPs have already rejected the nuclear option of moving out of the Palace altogether, turning it into a museum and building an entirely new parliament building somewhere else in London. A report commissioned by Parliament last year found the Victorian structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing. It warned that MPs and Lords will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics, heating, ventilation systems, drainage and stone work. They concluded that the World Heritage Site - which contains the Commons and Lords chambers as well as suites of committee rooms, offices and dining rooms - was so poorly-maintained that it is ‘remarkable that it continues to function’. And they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe, the Palace of Westminster could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834. Although they do not put a final cost on the work, they say it will be at least £1.6billion. The damning report on the state of the home of British democracy was ordered by the House of Commons Commission. Published in November, it warned: ‘While the precise cost of rectifying these deficiencies is still unknown, investigations conducted in recent years indicate that it is already in excess of 40 per cent of the insurance reinstatement value of the Palace.’ There has been no renovation to the spectacular building, rebuilt along designs by Charles Barry in the 1850s, since the late 1940s, following the destruction of the Commons chamber by Nazi bombs. The report goes on: ‘Considering the age of the Palace of Westminster, the 60-plus years that have passed since the partial post-war refurbishment, the long-term under-investment in the fabric and the intensive use to which the Palace is put, it is remarkable that it continues to function. ‘The signs of wear and tear, the number and frequency of relatively minor floods and mechanical breakdowns, the high cost of maintaining obsolescent equipment and the large sums that are now having to be spent on aggressive maintenance and risk reduction all provide tangible evidence of the looming crisis.' Packing up: The Commons and the Lords are expected to be vacated for two years while the major works are carried out . ‘A growing body of surveys, consultancy reports and risk registers point to the further deterioration that will occur and the severe hazards that could occur if fundamental renovation is delayed indefinitely. ‘It is hard to imagine how the Palace will survive for future generations to use and admire without a major mid-life overhaul.’ Among the many problems facing the building are antiquated electrics, clapped-out boilers and leaking roofs. Asbestos, which is ‘present throughout the building’, is identified as a ‘risk to all persons within the Palace of Westminster’.","Bidding process launched to assess scale of challenge .

Boris Johnson today insisted he was backing David Cameron 'all the way' after claims he was waiting for the Prime Minister to fail at the next election. Ex-Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson claimed the London Mayor would not 'stab' the Tory leader in the back but preferred to ‘ride in on his bike to save party and country’ should Mr Cameron and the Conservatives lose the 2015 general election. But Mr Johnson sought to play down the idea, insisting h was now 'increasingly confident' that Mr Cameron would retain power in two years' time. Scroll down for video . Backing: Boris Johnson insisted he was increasingly confident that David Cameron can win the next election . Bike: Ex-spin doctor Andy Coulson claimed the London Mayor, who cycled to a Global University summit today, wanted to ride to the Tory party's rescue after 2015 . Mr Coulson, the former News Of The World editor who was forced to resign as No10 director of communications two years ago, said it would be ‘off brand’ for Mr Johnson to plot against the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson has pledged to complete . his term as London mayor, which ends in 2016. But he has never ruled out . returning as an MP, which would enable him to put himself forward as . Conservative leader. Mr . Coulson, who is due to stand trial later this year over allegations . related to phone-hacking, made his comments in an article he wrote for . GQ magazine on his 10-point master plan for ‘saving’ Mr Cameron. He wrote: ‘Boris Johnson desperately wants to be prime minister and David has known that fact longer than most. ‘When . Boris asked me to pass on the message that he was keen to stand as . mayor of London, David responded: “Well, if he wins, he’ll want my job . next”.’ Andy Coulson (right) said David Cameron knows Boris Johnson wants to be Prime Minister but the Mayor of London thinks it would 'off brand' to directly challenge him . Mr Coulson went on: ‘If proof were needed that our PM is a man untroubled by self-doubt, it came in his next sentence - “so I think he’ll be a bloody brilliant candidate for us”. ‘Stabbing David, or anyone else for that matter, in the back would be distinctly off brand - just not very Boris. 'He would much prefer to see David fail miserably in the election and ride in on his bike to save party and country.’ But Mr Johnson, who has hinted at a desire to lead the Tory party if called upon, insisted he was backing Mr Cameron. Arriving at a Global Universities Summit, he said: 'Grateful as I always am to Andy for career advice, I am backing David Cameron all the way. 'I'm backing David who I am absolutely increasingly confident is going to win,' he added. Mr Coulson said the Tories’ strategy . for beating Labour should involve exposing leader Ed Miliband’s penchant . for ‘keeping his head down’ and ‘pray Ed Balls remains shadow . chancellor until the election’. On . Mr Miliband, he wrote: ‘The prime minister must push him to take . positions: expose his strategy (to keep his head down, silently hope . that the economy continues to go wonky and, well, just be the other . guy), challenge him to take a view on the tricky issues opposition . politicians love to duck.... He said Ed Miliband appointing Ed Balls as Shadow Chancellor was the 'gift that will keep on giving' ‘I’m struck by how detached the opposition front bench appears to be from their leader... I just don’t think they rate him very much. 'And if they don’t, there’s a good chance the public will feel the same way once they get to know him properly.’ He likened the relationship between Mr Miliband and Mr Balls to the ‘shamefully dysfunctional’ Tony Blair and Gordon Brown partnership when Labour were in power. ‘The prime minister should pray Ed Balls remains shadow chancellor until the election,’ Mr Coulson wrote. ‘Appointing him as George’s opposite number was the Miliband gift that will keep on giving. ‘The Tories must look for the divisions and make the most of them a) because they are most certainly real - always a plus - and b) because it’s history repeating itself. ‘We are in this hole at least in part because of the shamefully dysfunctional Blair/Brown relationship. Labour’s Two Eds dislike each other and each thinks he is smarter than the other. ‘The Conservatives should imagine in some detail how it would work if they actually won, and share that vision with the British public.’ Mr Coulson is also facing charges over an alleged conspiracy to bribe public officials for information.

The annual American Fitness Index was released today, which ranks the health of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country and taking the number one spot for the third year running are the twin cities of Minneapolis-St.Paul. Every year, the health and medical experts at the American College of Sports Medicine look at the 50 most populous towns in America to judge which the healthiest and most fit. The group looks at many factors that contribute to health, including: smoking, obesity rates, access to health care, availability of parks, recreational facilities, walking trails, and farmers’ markets. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE THE FULL LIST . Champs: For the third year in a row, Minneapolis-St. Paul are the fittest cities in America according to an analysis by the American College of Sports Medicine. Pictured are participants in the popular Twin Cities Marathon . This year, Twin Cities came out on top. ‘What Minneapolis has done brilliantly is put their resources where residents can use them effectively to maintain a high level of physical activity,’ Walt Thompson, a professor of exercise physiology at Georgia State University and chairman of the board that created the fitness index, told USA Today. ‘We really believe that if people don't have the environment to exercise, they probably won't,’ Thompson said. Minneapolis-St. Paul goes to considerable lengths to give people that environment. According to Thompson, the city spends double the amount of money on parks per capita as some other cities. He also says they win with baseball diamonds, ball parks, playgrounds, and dog parks. Last place: Due to a poor showing in areas like number of smokers and obesity rate, Oklahoma City took the number 50, and lowest, spot on the 2013 American Fitness Index . Health capital: Here, a runner sprints along the Tidal Basin in Washington, DC, chosen as the NO. 2 fittest city in America, based on things like available outdoor recreation space, various health statistics, and public transit . The Twin Cities see an overall lower incidence of heart disease and diabetes when compared with cities lower on the list. It also sees and overall higher rate, compared to those cities, of physical activity, use of public transit, and bicycling or walking to work. Since 2007, the American College of Sports Medicine has used data such as a city's obesity rate, access to outdoor recreation areas, smoking rate, and many other indicators of health in order to rank the nation's 50 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas by level of fitness. The top 25 are as follows: . 1. Minneapolis-St. Paul2. Washington, D.C.3. Portland, Ore.4. San Francisco5. Denver6. Boston7. Sacramento8. Seattle9. Hartford, Conn.10. San Jose11. Austin12. Salt Lake City13. Cincinnati14. San Diego15. Raleigh, N.C.16. Pittsburgh17. Baltimore18. Virginia Beach19. Cleveland20. Richmond, Va.21. Atlanta22. Providence23. Buffalo24. New York City25. Philadelphia . The opposite seems to be true for the cities that take up the bottom of the yearly list. At number 50, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was deemed the least fit city in America. Oklahoma City’s poor showing was the result, in part, for high rates of smoking, obesity, asthma, and diabetes. The city also has fewer parks per capita, dog parks, swimming pools, tennis courts, and other recreational areas. Thompson urges cities struggling to get off the bottom of the list and improve the lives of its residents by imposing smoking bans in public places, for instance, and by facilitating exercise by devoting money to parks and recreation. ‘We have issued the American Fitness Index each year since 2008 to help health advocates and community leader advocates improve the quality of life in their hometowns,’ Thompson said. ‘As urban areas attract more and more residents, it’s imperative for cities to create a built environment, fund amenities and form policies that get residents active and encourage healthy lifestyles.’ Whereas Minneapolis-St. Paul devoted $227 per capita on park-related expenses for its residents, Oklahoma City devoted just $61. Taking rest of the top five spots were: Washington, DC; Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, California; and Denver, Colorado. The bottom five included: Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; San Antonio, Texas; Detroit, Michigan; and Oklahoma City. And though the study’s findings that largely Southern or impoverished (or both) towns take up the bulk of the bottom half of its list, there were some surprises. Los Angeles, a city whose very name conjures images of trim beach bodies, outdoor sports, and fitness crazes, came up short in the list. The City of Angeles only made it to No. 29, due in part to the car-dependent town’s relatively low physical activity rate and relative lack of designated recreation areas. Slim city: Hip and healthy Portland, Oregon came in at number 3, based in part on the city's ample parkland and low obesity rate . Even further down the list was another town often associated with beauty and vitality. Miami, as part of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, Florida metropolitan area, was all the way down at No. 42. Though the cities have a relative abundance of swimming pools, they lost points for lack of city parks and a higher rate of poor mental health and low physical activity. Minneapolis-St.Paul-Bloomington was chosen as this year’s fittest metropolitan statistical area (MSA), as it was in 2012 and 2011. According to the study’s website, MSAs are used instead of cities because ‘residents outside the city limits have access to fitness-related resources in their suburban area as well as the city core’ and vice-versa. Visit the America College of Sports Medicine official site to see the full list and how your city measures up. No smoking: San Francisco's lower smoking rate and abundance of farmer's markets helped the city with a number 4 showing . Cool running: Well known for its outdoor recreation, Denver Colorado and its surrounding area skied into a comfortable number 5 spot .","Minneapolis-St.Paul is was crowned the fittest metropolitan area in the land by the American College of Sports Medicine for the third year running .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:11 EST, 30 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:19 EST, 31 May 2013 . Syria has received the first shipment of Russian missiles that are part of a more sophisticated air defense system, President Bashar Assad bragged today. Bashar Assad's comment on the arrival of the long-range S-300 air defense missiles in Syria could further ratchet up tensions in the region and undermine efforts to hold U.N.-sponsored talks with Syria's warring sides. Israel's defense chief Moshe Yaalon said earlier this week that Russia's plan to supply Syria with the weapons was a threat and that Israel was prepared to use force to stop the delivery. Arms deal: Russia has refused to scrap plans to provide Syrian President Bashar al-Assad with S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems, pictured, saying they will be a 'useful deterrent' to intervention in the country's conflict . Deadly: File photograph of Russian air-defence S-300 missiles being prepared for launch at a military training ground in Russia . Aid: A truck carrying supplies sent from Russia to Syrian refugees in Jordan is unloaded today . 'Syria has received the first shipment of Russian anti-aircraft S-300 . rockets,' Al-Manar  TV quoted Assad as saying. The Syrian leader added: 'All . our agreements with Russia will be implemented and parts of them have . already been implemented.' The shipment of the missiles, if confirmed, comes just days after the . European Union lifted an arms embargo on Syria, paving the way for . individual countries of the 27-member bloc to send weapons to rebels . fighting to topple Assad's regime. The developments raise fears of an arms race - not just between Assad's . forces and the opposition fighters battling to topple his regime, but . also in the wider Middle East. Israel has carried out several airstrikes in Syria in recent months that . are believed to have destroyed weapon shipments bound for Hezbollah, . the Lebanese Shiite group that along with Iran and Russia is a staunch . Assad ally. With the Russian missiles in Syria's possession, the Israeli air force's . ability to strike inside the Arab country could be limited since the . S-300s would allow it to counter . airstrikes. The S-300s have a range of up to 125 miles and the . capability to track and strike multiple targets simultaneously. Syria . already possesses Russian-made air defenses, and Israel is believed to . have used long-distance bombs fired from Israeli or Lebanese airspace. When Israeli warplanes struck near the capital of Damascus, targeting . purported Iranian missiles intended for Hezbollah earlier this month, . Syria did not respond. Civil war: President Bashar al-Assad's government is embroiled in a 26-month-long conflict with a Western-backed insurgency . Civilians walk past a Free Syrian Army fighter who is peeking through a hole in sandbags to look out for snipers loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo . But on Wednesday, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem told . Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen TV that Damascus 'will retaliate immediately' if . Israel strikes Syrian soil again. It was the regime's most serious warning to Israel since the beginning . of the conflict in March 2011 but it was not clear if there was a link . between al-Moallem's remark and the Russian shipment. Israel has long lobbied Moscow over the planned sale of S-300 . air-defense missiles to Syria. However, on Tuesday, Russia's deputy . foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said his government remained committed . to the deal. Monday's decision by the EU to lift the arms embargo opened the . possibility for individual countries to send weapons to Assad's . outgunned opponents, though there was no indication any single European . country would send lethal weapons to the rebels anytime soon. Britain and France, the main military powers in the EU, had pushed for . the lifting of the embargo, arguing that Europe's threat of arming the . rebels would force Assad to negotiate in good faith. Russia harshly criticized Europe's decision, saying it undercuts . international efforts to bring the opposing sides in Syrian conflict . together for a peace conference. Meanwhile government troops were mopping up in . northern and western parts of Qusair. Free Syrian Army fighters hold their weapons while standing near an opposition flag at their post in Aleppo's Bustan al-Qasr yesterday . The Syrian army on Wednesday took control of nearby Dabaa air base, . dealing a major blow to the rebels in Qusair, an overwhelmingly Sunni . town in western part of the country that has been controlled by the . opposition since early last year. The government launched an offensive on Qusair on May 19 and Hezbollah . militants joined the battle, drawing the Lebanese Shiite group deep into . the civil war next door. More than 70,000 people have been killed in the 26-month Syrian . conflict that has had increasingly sectarian overtones. Members of . Syria's Sunni Muslim majority dominate the rebel ranks and Assad's . regime is mostly made up of Alawites, an offshoot sect of Shiite Islam. Both sides in the conflict value Qusair, which lies along a land . corridor linking two Assad's strongholds, the capital of Damascus and an . area along the Mediterranean coast that is the Alawite heartland. Also Thursday, the opposition coalition said more than 1,000 wounded in . the government offensive in Qusair need to be evacuated for medical . treatment. The opposition said the town hospitals lack doctors and medical supplies to treat those injured and trapped there.","Russia has ignored calls from Israel and France not to send the weapons .

Iain Duncan Smith announces he would like to 'encourage' wealthy pensioners to hand back universal benefits such as free bus passes, television licences and winter fuel allowances, calling them an 'anomaly'. This made me so cross I can barely type. Duncan Smith (who manages on an income of £1,600 a week after tax) lives in a mansion his wife inherited, sent his son to Eton and sits in a government packed with old Etonians (another joined last week making a grand total of 12 at the heart of power), who talk about comfortably-off pensioners as if they are a threat to the economy! Iain Duncan Smith, left, announced he would like . to 'encourage' wealthy pensioners to hand back universal benefits such . as free bus passes, television licences... and Janet Street Porter, right, is having none of it . There are two kinds of wealth in modern Britain. Inherited wealth, inherited houses, inherited trust funds (ie the nest eggs of Cameron, IDS and co) and then there are the bank balances and shrinking pension pots which are the carefully stockpiled resources amassed by elderly citizens (ie me) who have paid tax their entire working lives. I'm one of these baby boomers politicians find so irritating, simply because there are more of us than ever at pensionable age. My parents worked out of necessity. Both were forced to leave school at 14, and spent years studying to improve their chances in life. I grew up in half a terraced house in Fulham, with an outside toilet. My parents impressed upon me the mantra of hard work, saving, and not being a burden to anyone. I haven't got an off-shore company, wealthy relatives who've left me stocks and shares or nice houses in the country. Everything I own I have worked for, paid tax on and I have no debt. If I am due a bus pass and a winter fuel allowance, then I shall be taking them. If I want to increase my contribution to charity as a result, then that is my decision, I don't welcome a 'nudge' from a politician. The Government is full of rich men and women who have been privately educated, who send their kids to religious schools to avoid the local dumping ground, who have lovely country houses and staff we pay for via their expenses. They talk of mansion taxes but they cleverly minimise their own tax liabilities on their second homes. Most have never done a day's  manual work in their lives. Nick Clegg — who lives in a swanky house in Putney, whose wife earns a fortune, and who holidays in a  family ski chalet that is worth  millions — has been attacking  pensioner's benefits since the beginning of the year. He claims that Cameron 'will be punished' by voters if the PM sticks to his promise to protect universal benefits beyond the length of this parliament. Clegg must be bonkers, because to attack pensioners is to commit political suicide. We are the only group who can be relied on to vote, who turn out in all weathers. Never mind Cameron's weedy concept of 'the Big Society', it's pensioners who volunteer, who look after their grandchildren for nowt, who visit neighbours and friends who need help. P  ensioners are a huge asset to this country, not a bunch of spongers who need to be means-tested and denigrated. Clegg talks of 'millionaire' pensioners, but if your assets are tied up in your home, you're hardly in the same category as Sir Alan Sugar or Bruce Forsyth. Most pensioners work part-time (if at all), live on fixed incomes, face rising heating and food costs. If they own a car, then the exhorbitant cost of petrol will be eating into their outgoings. I'd like to know exactly who these 'millionaire' pensioners are, because I think they are a  figment of Mr Clegg's fertile imagination, an unashamed ploy to  garner the youth vote. Last week saw the unedifying spectable of Richard Benyon,  Minister for Food, telling us to eat more leftovers and wrap up cheese to prevent it going mouldy, claiming households are chucking away food worth £50 a month. That statement, which takes the gold medal for unadulterated rubbish, comes from Britain's richest MP, worth an estimated £105 million, and who takes part in a bizarre  ritual each year handing out loaves to the poor in his parish. Iain Duncan Smith's equally unfortunate remarks about pensioners couldn't have come at a worse time for the Tories, with the local elections later this week. Invasion of the flaxen-haired muppets! Be very afraid . After reading John Wyndham's spooky The Midwich Cuckoos (filmed as Village Of The Damned) I had nightmares for weeks. Night after night, an unsmiling blonde person with staring eyes would follow me around, blocking my path. Now I'm getting the same dreams, as our news media is full of strange flaxen-haired muppets. Are the Johnson family (above right) the modern reincarnation of Wyndam's alien beings (above left)? Their blondeness, and overwhelming sense of their own importance sets them apart from us lesser mortals. They seem determined to bend us to their will with their ferocious mental powers. The children in the Village of The Damned... who remind Janet-Street Porter of the Johnson family . When I ran into Rachel Johnson at a party she announced loudly: 'You don't like me, do you?' It was the first time I'd actually clapped eyes on her in the flesh. Pushy Rachel has talked up editing a minor magazine (The Lady) into a major journalistic achievement - at least I've edited a national newspaper. This Miss Pushy wrote about waxing her pubic hair for Vogue, and has just penned a piece on modern manners, naturally featuring a very large picture of her favourite person - herself. Boris is a genius at self-promotion, and now Jo, their younger brother, has been appointed David Cameron's policy chief. Time to be very scared. Jo, Rachel and Boris Johnson . Forget publicity stunts for charity, just cough up . Ben Affleck . Living in Hollywood rather blinds you to the real world. When I spent a year working there, I was the fattest woman at any event by at least three dress sizes, and shopping for jeans I thought I had strayed into a children's clothes store as the garments were so tiny. In this rarefied atmosphere, movie stars get over-exercised about big issues — and expect us to take  them seriously. Of course they want to end world poverty, poor darlings, but do they have to tell us  all about it via Twitter? Ben Affleck is going to spend five days this week living on just £1 day, participating in the Live Below The Line challenge, to raise awareness of world poverty. Frankly, it's hard to imagine many people are UNAWARE of world poverty, as we live in a world of mass communication. Wouldn't it be better for millionaires like Mr Affleck to stick to their normal diets of organic tofu and expensive mineral water and just donate a larger part of their obscenely high salaries to help the poor? Louise Mensch . Former Tory MP Louise Mensch has finally told us she had a facelift for ‘maintenance’ — she says she’s not discussed it before because she felt it would trivialise female politicians. This is the same Louise Mensch who posed in a tight black leather skirt and revealing white blouse for a men’s magazine. The same MP who dumped her constituents mid-parliamentary term, claiming she needed to be with her rock manager husband in New York. The House of Commons is full of married women (Yvette Cooper for starters) who combine bringing up kids with the demands of a high-achieving husband and unsociable parliamentary hours. Why the sudden revelations? Louise Mensch has started a website Unfashionista, which is full of advertising and pictures of — Louise Mensch. On it, she promotes self-help books,  exercise routines, and talks about her facelift, posting ictures of herself in skintight shorts at the trendy Coachella music  festival in California. There is an intelligent debate to be had about cosmetic surgery — a review set up after the PIP breast-implants scandal has found that the use of Botox and fillers is completely unregulated, and women could be placing themselves in serious danger unless standards are imposed. The study recommended  there should be a register of procedures, and an insurance scheme to protect customers. If Louise Mensch had remained an MP, this is the kind of legislation she should have been pioneering, to help other women. Cosmetic surgery has been  normalised — hairdressers and unqualified practitioners offer a wide range of treatments. Louise Mensch can describe her facelift as if she’s a car going in for an MoT, but what if she’d ended up with a droopy eyelid or crooked lips? Last week I had dinner with Nigel Farage, who berated me for not agreeing to appear on Question Time with him last Thursday. I had another engagement - but what is it about Nige and me that appeals to QT' producers? We've appeared together at least three times - perhaps the programme makers think we stand for two polar opposites. Nigel is an excellent speaker, even if he dresses rather like a Fifties' estate agent. I gave him a lift to the station and was rewarded with a damp kiss on each cheek.","Also, Boris Johnson's powerful siblings...

On board: TV personality Ryan Seacrest and his actress girlfriend Julianne Hough were on the latest flight which had to make an emergency landing . A British Airways jet carrying 266 people has been forced to make an emergency landing due to suspected toxic oil fumes, just 11 days after a similar incident. The Boeing 747, which was carrying American Idol host Ryan Seacrest and his girlfriend, the singer and accress Julianne Hough, was not even one hour into the journey from Los Angeles to Heathrow when it was forced to land again after passengers and crew started to feel unwell. The captain had become concerned after crew and business class customers were affected early on during the flight on Thursday. All three pilots and four cabin crew had to be taken to hospital for checks, while a number of passengers were treated by paramedics, after emergency services met the aircraft in Las Vegas, the Sunday Express has reported. Following the incident, a BA spokesman said: 'Safety is always our top priority and as a precaution, the Captain decided to divert our Los Angeles to London service into Las Vegas, following a suspected technical problem. 'Our pilots used their training and experience throughout and the flight landed normally at Las Vegas. 'We provided hotels for the customers and we will be rebooking customers onto alternative flights out of Las Vegas as soon as possible.' The news comes just one week after it was revealed a BA Boeing 777 was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada, as it made its way from Heathrow to Philadelphia, after suspected toxic oil fumes were reported on the flight deck. In that instance the plane, carrying 158 passengers, made the unscheduled stop at Goose Bay, in Newfoundland, in temperatures of -30C. British Airways said the latest aircraft has been taken out of service for investigation. It said there were early indications which pointed to a 'fault with the number three engine', according to the Sunday Express. A spokesman said: 'The engine's maintenance programme would, of course, be in accordance with the manufacturer's regulations. Safety is always our top priority.' The spokesman apologised to the passengers on Thursday night's flight and said: 'The smell could only be smelt on the upper deck and 20 business class customers in that area were informed of the situation. There was no unusual smell on the main deck.' Three weeks ago the first picture was released of one of two top BA pilots who died within days of each other after complaining about being exposed to toxic oil fumes on passenger planes. A British Airways Boeing 747 was less than an hour into a trip from Los Angeles to Heathrow when it was forced to land again due to suspected toxic oil fumes (file picture) It was reported last month that Richard Westgate, 43, died after instructing his lawyers to sue BA for health and safety breaches days before fellow pilot Karen Lysakowska, 43, passed away. Both claimed they had been poisoned by the fumes that can contaminate cabin air and which regularly force pilots to wear oxygen masks. Mr Westgate's lawyers want to 'give him the trial he never got' by suing the airline in a case they say will be a 'moment of truth' for the aviation industry. They say they are on the cusp of proving in court the existence of 'aerotoxic syndrome', a chronic physical and neurological condition they insist will one day be seen as 'the new asbestos'. Thousands of pilots are currently 'unfit to fly', one specialist doctor has claimed. A BA spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with the families of the two pilots at this very sad time and we offer our sincere condolences. 'We are not aware of any legal claims relating to the two individuals. It would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate upon the individuals' cause of death.' BA has said it is not aware of any link between the deaths and the latest incident.

Cheat: Havering Council worker, Cheema, 23, abused his position to fraudulently claim benefits . A crooked benefits adviser teamed up with his mother to cheat the council where he worked out of £30,000 in housing and council tax benefits, using insider knowledge of the welfare system. Havering Council worker Manjit Singh Cheema, 23, and his mother Balbir Kaur, 46, both of Romford, Essex, were spared jail after admitting fraud by abuse of position. Since 2009, Kaur claimed £29,500 as a single mother, while she and her two young children shared a home with a man and her elder son, Cheema. Following a tip-off in 2011, investigating officers discovered that the house was co-owned by Cheema and the other male occupant, and arrested mother and son in November that year. Cheema, whose job was to answer housing . and council tax queries, told council bosses he lived at another house and failed to tell them he was his mother's landlord. Judge William Graham told Cheema and . Kaur: 'This is serious, not only as it is a fraud of public funds, but . as it makes the situation for genuine claimants more difficult'. An examination of Kaur's fraudulent claim forms  revealed it was . Cheema who had filled them in. The investigation discovered that a deposit of £60,000 had been paid on the £210,000 house in Romford, with monthly mortgage payments taken from Cheema's account. The deposit was described in the mortgage agreement as a family gift. Judge William Graham told Cheema and . Kaur: 'This is serious, not only as it is a fraud of public funds, but . as it makes the situation for genuine claimants more difficult.' Councillor Roger Ramsey of Havering Council . said: 'They were acting as if they wanted to help the poorest people in . our society, when really the fraud meant they were stealing from their . pockets.

Basildon Crown Court sentenced them yesterday to nine months in jail suspended for 18 months, and ordered them to do 150 hours of unpaid work. Havering council said it would pursue them both for the return of the money they stole.

A French female photographer could face a year in prison and a magazine could be closed following the publication of topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge on holiday. Valerie Suau, from the newspaper La Provence, is being questioned after images of Kate Middleton sunbathing sparked public outrage when they appeared in France's Closer magazine. Suau has been placed under formal criminal investigation. Mondadori, which publishes the magazine, and La Provence, which featured photographs of the Duchess which did not involve nudity, are similarly under police investigation. Each could be fined up to 45,000 euros (£38,350) if found guilty and the publications could be closed for up to five years. 'The photographer and legal representatives of both companies have been questioned concerning the photographing of a person on private property and the criminal use of these images,' a spokesman for the prosecutor in the Paris suburb of Nanterre said. 'The maximum penalty for this kind of offence is one year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros for individuals. 'For corporate bodies, the fine is 45,000 euros, cessation of business for five years and public notification of the decision.' Kate, 31, and 30-year-old Prince . William took legal action against Closer in September, as their lawyer, . Aurelien Hamelle, described the Duchess as a 'a young woman, not an . object’. Carrying on: The Duchess of Cambridge attended an engagement at the National Portrait Gallery last night . Work: The Duchess of Cambridge attends the evening reception to celebrate the work of the Art Room charity . He said the royal couple had suffered a . 'grotesque breach of privacy' and felt 'violated' during a 'highly . intimate moment during a scene of married life'. Ms Suau, whose name is pronounced . 'sewer', has kept a low profile ever since the case, but police are . believed to have arrested her earlier this month. She took the photos on September 5 as the couple relaxed at Viscount Linley's retreat, Chateau d'Autet, in Provence. Referring to Princess Diana's death in . 1997, Mr Hamelle said it was 'just six days after the 15th anniversary . of the cynical and morbid hunt which led to the death of William's . mother'. Mr Hamelle told the court William and . Kate could not have known they were being spied on and a photographer . would have needed a long lens, even if he or she was on a public road. Controversial images: The French magazine Closer showed topless pictures of Kate in an issue last September . Mr Hamelle said that if the original . digital images were not handed in, the Mondadori group - which publishes . Closer - should be fined £8,000 a day for non-compliance. The Duke and Duchess also launched . criminal proceedings against the then unnamed photographer under . France's strict privacy laws. The French media are protected from . having to name their sources - including photographers - but the royal . couple are said to have made it a personal crusade to discover who took . the images.. Photography spot: Some pictures were shot from a public road on a hill less than half-a-mile from the former hunting lodge, close to the medieval village of Viens, although it is possible to get closer on foot . Ms Suau has denied being responsible . for taking any indecent images. She says she took pictures of Kate in . her swimsuit but not topless. Yet, despite her claims, no other photographer has been identified, nor even been placed in the area at the time. Delphine Pando, representing the . magazine, told a court case in the Paris suburb of Nanterre last year . that topless photographs were no longer considered shocking. Past: Referring to Princess Diana's death in 1997, Mr Hamelle said it was 'just six days after the 15th anniversary of the cynical and morbid hunt which led to the death of William's mother . She denied that the chateau was . inaccessible to public view and claimed the magazine did not hold the . rights to the pictures, so it could not be proved that it intended to . republish them. Ms Suau, who lives close to Chateau . d'Autet, deep in the Provence countryside east of Avignon, told friends . there was no sign of British or French police anywhere, so allowing 'any . photographer who wanted' to take images. Some were shot from a public road on a . hill less than half-a-mile from the former hunting lodge, close to the . medieval village of Viens, although it is possible to get closer on . foot. The road, and nearby path, offers . clear views of the Chateau's raised swimming pool and its sun loungers, . where Kate and William spent most of their four day break. It was from here that a set of . intimate images were captured and later published in the French Closer . magazine, which is now being sued by the couple for invasion of privacy. Ms Suau produced one set of pictures . on Friday September 7th - the day the couple left. This is the same day . that the Closer pictures were taken. She aimed her camera at the pool at . around 1.30pm, where she saw William wearing just a pair of swimming . shorts and sunglasses as he read his I-pad. Kate, meanwhile, was in a . bikini. No British newspapers printed the pictures, which also appeared in Italian gossip magazine Chi - Closer's sister magazine - and the Irish Daily Star. A Paris prosecutors source confirmed . that 'a female photographer' working for La Provence, and 'the publisher . of Closer' had both been placed under formal criminal investigation . over the topless pictures. A spokesman for St James's Palace said: 'The ongoing legal process is a matter for the French authorities.' La Provence refused to comment on the investigation but said said Ms Suau had its 'support in the legal challenge she is facing today', the BBC said. Mondadori, an Italian publishing group owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, said it was 'not aware of anything new with respect to what is already known about the issue.' William and Kate were said to have been angered by the intrusion into their privacy and the magazine and photographers involved were left in no doubt about their feelings when a strongly worded statement was issued by St James's Palace last year. It said: 'The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to the Duke and Duchess for being so.'

"By . Julie Cook . PUBLISHED: . 17:21 EST, 26 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:45 EST, 26 May 2013 . The wedding party was almost ready to set off. I took a deep breath, smoothed my ivory lace gown one last time and glanced around me. My bridegroom Cornel looked handsome and dashing in his morning suit, his lilac cravat toning beautifully with the flowers in my bouquet. Our little boy Alex, then 11 months old, toddled behind me, so cute in his tiny suit he was almost edible — a perfect miniature of his father in every way. Overprotective: First-time mum Julie Cook was so worried that her toddler Alex would hurt himself that she bought him a crash helmet, and even dressed the tot in the safety gear for her wedding . Every way, but one. On my son’s head sat an ugly brown helmet, fastened tightly under his chin, and Cornel had just spotted it. ‘Oh no, Julie — not today,’ he sighed, rolling his eyes. ‘What about the photos? The guests will think we’re mad!’ ‘The town hall is huge,’ I protested, ‘and it’s full of sharp edges and polished floors. What if he hits his head?’ Eventually, as my chief bridesmaid muttered about the time, a compromise was negotiated. I would agree to remove the helmet if Alex could remain strapped into his buggy throughout the ceremony. But at the hotel, where the reception was taking place, it would go back on — and stay on. Safety fears: Julie bought Alex the helmet when he was around nine-months-old . It’s not as if Alex wasn’t used to it. He . wasn’t even a year old, yet he had become accustomed to living in an . environment created for him by the world’s most over-protective mother. Looking back, I was always rather . anxious, but that’s normal for first-time mums. It wasn’t until Alex . became mobile that my parental paranoia really kicked in. He crawled . quite early; he was barely seven months old. But the sight of my baby . gleefully propelling himself across the floor of our front room made me . feel quite ill. My heart hammered in my chest. Beads of cold sweat prickled the back of my neck. I knew straight away that it was a strange reaction, so I took deep breaths and told myself that learning to crawl was a perfectly normal development; something to be celebrated — another milestone passed in a child’s necessary exploration of the world around him. So why, when other mothers might reach for their cameras, was I fighting the temptation to confine my boy in a playpen or a buggy? Why, when most women would actively encourage their infants, did I long to hold my child back? I suspect the answers to those questions can be found in events that took place long before my son was even born. Alex was the happy result of my third pregnancy. Before he arrived to make our dreams come true, I suffered two miscarriages. I lost my first baby at nine weeks and the second one at six weeks. And all the time I was expecting Alex, I continued to show symptoms that indicated I might miscarry again. So that whole pregnancy was spent in fear. From the very day I discovered I was having Alex, I became convinced I was about to lose him, too. That he was eventually born safely was as much a surprise to me as a joy. When I finally accepted he was here — alive and healthy — the fear that he would share the fate of my first two babies was replaced by another fear. Suddenly, the world around me seemed unsafe. Secret purchase: Julie bought the helmet from an online seller, without telling her husband Cornel, who joked that their son was about to start performing stunts . While he was tiny, I convinced myself that I could keep any threat to my precious child at bay with ceaseless vigilance. But . as Alex grew and wanted to explore, our whole world, even our home, . turned into a place full of dangers. It was all I could see. The edges . of tables and drawers looked as sharp as blades. Short, out-of-reach . blind cords, belts and bits of string were now strangulation hazards. Anything smaller than a tennis ball was a potential choking hazard. And . heaven help any innocent men who smiled at my son in his pram. Potential . child abductors, all of them. When . Alex started pulling himself upright, I began sticking big blobs of . Blu-Tack on every sharp corner in our home in case his precious head . should make contact with them. No table, dining chair or chest of . drawers was safe from my paranoid attention. I bought extra pillows and cushions, . dozens of them, and placed them everywhere — against doors, skirting . boards and cupboards. Our front room looked like the inside of a bedouin . tent, but still I couldn’t relax. So I went online and researched safety equipment. When Alex was about nine months old I found a company which produced helmets for babies and toddlers, so I ordered one, without telling Cornel. ‘What the blazes is that?’ he asked the first time he saw his son in it. ‘It’s a crash hat,’ I said sheepishly. Seeing sense: Julie soon realised that her little boy was itching to explore, without his protective headgear, and Cornel made her bin the helmet . ‘For what,’ he demanded. ‘Is Alex going to start motorcycle stunts?’ But . I couldn’t be persuaded — or teased — into backing down. I thought the . helmet was wonderful. I could cook, work, or do housework knowing Alex . was safe. And I tried not to notice him tugging in irritation at the . strap under his chin. I made my toddler wear it all the time at home, . and obviously there was no way he would be allowed out of it at our . wedding reception. And so, after we’d said our vows and moved on to the . hotel, I buckled the helmet on to Alex’s head. Every so often I’d notice friends throwing him puzzled looks. ‘Does he really need that, Julie?’ one asked. ‘Of . course!’ I hissed, almost offended. ‘There’s a massive glass vase over . there. And look at the sharp corners on those shelves!’ Adventurous: Nearly four years on from his helmet-wearing days, Alex has grown into a fearless little boy . A few days later, when we posted our wedding photos online, questions began to flood in from friends who hadn’t been there. ‘I saw Alex wearing a helmet — is everything all right,’ asked one. ‘Has he got a head injury?’ Then another, an old childhood friend, asked more bluntly: ‘Why is that poor boy wearing that ridiculous hat?’ I . offered my usual explanation; that the world was a far too dangerous . place to unleash a wobbly-legged toddler. ‘You can’t be serious,’ she . told me. ‘Have you forgotten what a daredevil you used to be?’ Her . words stung. They brought back my own carefree childhood in the . Eighties — the long summer holidays when my friends and I were allowed . to play outside until all hours, revelling in our independence, never . giving a thought to the bruises, bumps and splinters picked up along the . way. I would roller-skate downhill at breakneck speed and on a bike I was a total menace. I once went so fast that when I slammed on the brakes I catapulted myself head-first over a neighbour’s parked car. I was none the worse for any of it, although I can’t speak for the car. In fact, the freedom my parents gave me taught me to be self-reliant, not to whine about minor injuries and to puzzle out my problems for myself. It made me strong. I gazed at my son sitting on the floor in the safety of his own home, wearing a crash hat, surrounded by cushions. His little face was full of the excitement and curiosity of a child aching to explore the world, and it broke my heart. Was I protecting him — or smothering him? My friends were right. Perhaps I needed to let go a little. With great reluctance, I put the helmet in the wardrobe. Cornel raised an exasperated eyebrow and pointed to the bin. So I threw it away. Then . I picked off every piece of sticky Blu-Tack from the furniture and . offered up a silent prayer that Alex wouldn’t knock himself out. Over . the next few months, Alex fell over countless times. On one occasion he . fell on to the corner of my laptop and I rushed him to A&E. He . didn’t even have a bruise. Happy families: Julie says she has realised that being a good mother is not only about protecting your child, but equipping them to survive in the world, sharp corners and all . The doctors told me that babies were resilient and to go home. They were right: he was fine. As . he grew, I lost count of the times he fell and cried; the times I had . to put ‘magic cream’ on his bloodied knees. But as my husband says: . ‘This is what little boys do.’ Nearly . four years on, Alex has grown into a typically fearless little boy. He . whizzes around on his bike like a miniature Bradley Wiggins, loves . climbing trees and always seems to have rips in his trousers and scabs . on his knees. While I still . feel that flutter of fear in my stomach when I see him career off on his . bike, I tell myself it is normal; that I have to watch quietly from the . sidelines, and that those minor injuries are just little markers of . lessons learned on his journey to adulthood. I . finally realised that being a good mother is not only about protecting . your child, but equipping them to survive in the world — sharp corners . and all.","Anxious Julie Cook bought a crash helmet for her son Alex .

She went on to admit her high expectations might make her difficult to work for. She said: ‘I’m a perfectionist, I like everything to be right.

I love women and I want to . make women feel good about themselves and confident and empowered.’ Poking . fun at those working in the fashion industry who make regular use of . Botox, she said: ‘There were a lot of raised eyebrows, well those who . could raise their eyebrows, that I was going to design a fashion line. 'There were a lot of preconceptions but I didn’t set out to prove them wrong, I set out to prove to myself I could do it.’ It was just one of many revelations Mrs Beckham made about her fashion designing business. She said she encourages her staff to bring their children to work, joking that her office is like a creche. She said: ‘My office is quite small and Harper had this swing. So she would swing one way and bash into a pile of fabrics and then swing the other way and bash into a rail of clothes. It’s a small creche.’ Late at night Mrs Beckham devotes time . to her beauty regime, when she plucks her eyebrows, and falls asleep . thinking about what she will wear the  following day. Daddy day care: David seen with daughter Harper on Monday . ‘I’ve got four kids so I don’t have as much time as I’d like in the morning to pick out what I’m going to wear,’ she said. ‘I . think about it in bed before I go to sleep, I visualise it. It’s funny, . I told David and he said he actually visualises football when he’s . lying in bed. And  Gordon Ramsay told me he  visualises food.’ Mrs Beckham’s morning routine also involves rigorous exercise, and she is a sworn fan of celebrity fitness guru Tracy Anderson, who Gwyneth Paltrow credits with helping her achieve her trim figure. ‘I get up really early three times a week to work out,’ she said. ‘I do Tracy Anderson. It’s a bit of dancing on the treadmill, a bit of bottom work.’ Babe in arms: David and a very sleepy looking Harper were seen out in London on Monday . She added: ‘I’ve done rock climbing with the children, cycling, and I don’t wear heels for that.’ The Beckhams' moved to Los Angeles when David signed with the LA Galaxy football team and have since returned to live in London. Mrs Beckham said she was enjoying life back in the UK, even though her husband is now playing for Paris St-Germain in France. On Sunday night the footballer was sent off after just six minutes. ‘Living in London is very, very different from Los Angeles, but it’s great, it’s inspiring – London is such an inspiring place to live, so multicultural, it’s interesting, I’m happy,’ she added.","Former Spice Girl turned fashion designer spoke at the Vogue Festival .

Rescuers who plucked a teenage hiker from a steep, rocky canyon wall on Thursday said she was exhausted, had trouble breathing and likely could not have survived much longer than another day in the rugged southern California wilderness. Kyndall Jack, 18, was rescued from a near-vertical wall in Falls Canyon in Cleveland National Forest, five days after she got lost on a day hike with a friend. 'She was kind of clinging to the ledge on the cliff side, kind of going in and out of consciousness,' said Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Jim Moss, a paramedic who treated her. Scroll down for video . Drama in the wild: Kyndall Jack, 18, is airlifted to safety by Los Angeles County Search and Rescue after being missing for five days in rugged country near Rancho Santa Margarita, California . Rescued: Miss Jack is being treated in hospital and her family have been notified that she is safe . 'We climbed up to her and could see she was in a lot of pain, obviously completely dehydrated and very weak. 'She wouldn't have made it much longer. She's really lucky.' Barely able to move, Jack had managed . to scream on and off for 90 minutes, shouting at times, 'I'm here, I'm . here,' as rescuers moved toward her. It was her screams that brought . searchers to her hours after they found her hiking companion, . 19-year-old Nicolas Cendoya on Wednesday night, said Orange County . sheriff's Lt. Jason Park. 'We started to close in. We heard the . voice from all our ground crews and surrounded it and made contact with . her,' he said. 'It was very difficult to extract her.' Risky adventure: Kyndall Jack's father said his daughter called him Sunday to say that she is going on a hike, which was unusual for her . A reserve deputy aiding the effort . suffered a head injury when he fell 60 feet down the canyon. He was also . flown to a hospital. His name was not released and his condition was . not immediately known. After rescuers found Jack they strapped her into a harness and lifted her into a helicopter that took her to hospital. She and Cendoya had driven to the . area on Easter Sunday for what was supposed to be a short, easy day hike . through a picturesque canyon to a waterfall. The area is part of the . rugged forest that sprawls across 720 miles of Southern California. Before his cellphone's battery died, . Cendoya was able to make a 911 call Sunday telling authorities the . couple had gotten lost and were in distress. 'He was panting and said, ''We're out . of water.'' You could hear Kyndall in the background,"" said Orange . County fire Capt. Jon Muir. 'He said, ''I think we're about a . mile or two from the car,'' and he was right about the distance but in . totally the wrong direction.' Cendoya was found on Wednesday night . in shorts and a shirt but missing his shoes. He was flown to Mission . Hospital in Mission Viejo, where doctors said he was being treated for . severe dehydration, scratches and bruises. He was expected to remain for . several days. Park said Cendoya was 'extremely . confused and disoriented', when he was found less than a mile from the . pair's car, giving an added urgency to the effort to find his friend. Jack was found in similar condition, dressed in a pair of dirty athletic shorts, a hoodie and socks, having also lost her shoes. Her rescuers said she couldn't . remember what day it was or even that she had gone hiking. She had no . idea how she had gotten on to the steep, rocky canyon outcropping where . they found her. She was suffering from low blood pressure, shortness of breath and had pain in both legs and one hand. Despite that, she suffered no major . internal injuries and was listed in good condition at the University of . California, Irvine, Medical Center, said hospital spokesman John Murray. Like Cendoya, she was being treated for dehydration and was expected to be hospitalized for several days. At Mission Hospital, Dr. Michael . Ritter told reporters Cendoya said he survived by taking shelter at . night in heavy brush and passing his days by praying. Anxious: Russ Jack waits for the word about his missing daughter after learning that she twisted her ankle and could not keep up with Nicholas . Renewed hope: O.C Sheriff Sgt Brian Sims talks to the parents before sending a team of rescuers to check out a flicker of light on the foggy ridge of mountain about 700 feet from Trabuca Flyers Club . 'He's got a lot of faith in the Lord, . which I think will help him to work his way through this,' Ritter said . shortly before Miss Jack was located. Cendoya told doctors he and Jack became separated sometime on Sunday night. He was found on a steep hill less . than a mile from where the pair had left their car, but the brush was so . thick that a person wouldn't be able to see someone standing as close . as five feet away, Park said. Miss Jack was found nearby. The area is just 500 feet from a dirt . road that is fairly heavily traveled, but Park said Cendoya was so . disoriented he likely wasn't aware of that. 'He was in an area near where people were calling his name and he didn't even know it,' Park said. Brush in the area was so dense that . even after he was found, a helicopter dispatched to rescue him had . trouble keeping track of where he was. Two volunteer searchers got lost . themselves and had to be flown out on Wednesday afternoon. Cendoya says on his Facebook page . that he's a 2011 graduate of Orange County's Costa Mesa High School and a . student at Orange Coast College. A number of photos show the . athletic-looking young man working out and lifting weights. He and Miss Jack are believed to have . gotten lost near near Holy Jim Trail, a tree-lined dirt path along a . creek that leads to the waterfall. Missing hikers: Nick Cendoya, 19, left, and Kyndall Jack, 18, right, lost their way while on a hike in the Cleveland National Forest. They have both been found . Rescue: Firefighters escort Nick Cendoya to a waiting ambulance after he was found in the bush last night . Help: 'Dehydrated and delirious', Nick is stretchered off and taken to hospital . The path is popular with day hikers, . including families with children, and is not considered particularly . difficult. Park warned, however, that it's very easy to get lost in the . heavy brush and hikers who venture in should be prepared with plenty of . food, water and proper clothing. The area is in a section of forest in . the Santa Ana Mountains that lie along the border of Orange and . Riverside counties southeast of Los Angeles. The trail ranges in . elevation from about 2,000 feet to about 4,000 feet. Officials said Miss Jack's family was quickly notified that she had been found. 'They cried. They hugged us. They thanked us immensely,' Capt John Muir of the Orange County Fire Authority said. Her father Russ Jack told the LA Times that Cendoya said he had communicated with Kyndall even after they were separated. 'Nicholas obviously was disoriented . because of dehydration... he thought that Kyndall had already been . rescued,' he said. 'He told us, ""I haven't seen her for a day. I think . she's already been rescued."" Authorities . ramped up the search for Kyndall today after finding Cendoya gave them . renewed hope that both teens will be found alive. Rough terrain: Officials believe the two teens . took a detour and got off the Cleveland National Forest's popular Holy Jim Trail, a tree-lined dirt path along a creek that . leads to a waterfall and is popular with day hikers .

They are famed for their budget yet fashionable collections, but Forever 21’s cut-price business plan has been accused of creating ‘sweatshop-like’ conditions for their workers. The Los Angeles-based fashion chain is being investigated by The Labor Department, which has so far revealed evidence of ‘significant’ violations of federal law. Violations include breaches to minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping by contractors, manufacturers and vendors supplying goods to Forever 21, The US Department of Labor said in a statement. Forever 21's flagship store opens in New York's Times Square in 2010 . A news release has been issued detailing the recent investigation by the department’s Wage and Hour Division in the Southern California’s garment industry. Dozens of vendors for Forever 21 have been under investigation since 2008, but were finally handed a subpoena in August this year after they refused to cooperate with the inquiry. The agency wants their contractors and manufacturers’ hourly wage documentation, as well as workers’ hours and their employment practices. Regional administrator for the department’s West division, Ruben Rosalez, said in the statement: ‘When companies like Forever 21 refuse to comply with subpoenas, they demonstrate a clear disregard for the law. ‘The Labor Department will use all enforcement tools available to recover workers’ wages and hold employers accountable.’ A spokesperson for Forever 21 told the MailOnline: 'Forever 21 shares the Department of Labor’s commitment to proper wage payment under the Fair Labor Standards Act. 'To that end, Forever 21 promptly responded to the Department’s subpoena with information that resulted in a full resolution of the matter under investigation. 'Forever 21 also offered to meet with the Department and is surprised and disappointed that the Department declined to meet before filing this action but looks forward to working with them to address any issues.' The retailer, which has stores throughout America, is just one example of the widespread violations of minimum wage and hours in Southern California’s garment industry. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FSLA) is cracking down on Los Angeles and Orange counties’ fashion districts and more than 1,500 investigations have been conducted in LA, San Diego and West Covina over the last five years. Of those investigations, 93 per cent uncovered violations and the FSLA found over $11 million in wages back owed to 11,000 employees. Federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, plus time and a half of regular rates for hours worked over 40 per week.","Los Angeles-based chain is being investigated by The Labor Department, which has uncovered evidence of 'significant' violations of federal law ."

Your family's weekend trip to see The Great Gatsby, with all of it's depictions of boozy flapper parties, might be more costly than the already pricey tickets. A new study published this week in JAMA Pediatrics found that exposure to alcohol in PG-13 and lower films is on the rise, and it may lead to a rise in underage drinking. The study tracked appearances of both cigarettes and alcohol on TV and in the movies and found some surprising results. Down with tobacco: A graph from the study shows that instances of smoking in movies hit a high in 1999, and them completely plummeted by 2006 since tobacco companies were banned from product placement . In 1998, the state attorney generals signed the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) which banned tobacco brands from paying for product placement on TV and in films. What happened next was extraordinary. The Dartmouth study tracked the top 100 grossing movies each year and found that tobacco brand appearances went from an all time high of near 100 in 1999 to the rock bottom of about 20 in 2006. From there it plateaued, reflecting a changed American view on tobacco use. TV vices: The characters on Mad Men are known for their indulgent boozing and smoking, but overall tobacco depictions on TV and in movies has decreased dramatically since 1999 . But the study also focused on alcohol depictions, and in that department found quite a different story. Because there never was a MSA-equivalent agreement on alcohol product placement in the media (and likely won't be due to First Amendment challenges), overall depictions of alcohol have stayed the same. What is most troubling though is the number of appearances in youth-rated films. For films rated PG-13 and lower, alcohol appearances are actually on the rise. Starting young: Heavy drinking portrayed in PG-13 movies such as The Great Gatsby is the most troubling aspect of the study, since there is a correlation between adolescents seeing alcohol in the media and wanting to drink in real life . This isn't good news, since several studies suggest that, like cigarettes, there is a link between media portrayals of drinking and adolescents subsequently drinking. A rise in underage drinking could mean more drinking-related accidents and even deaths. When states took a hard line on tobacco advertising with the MSA, it correlated with U.S. teen smoking hitting a record low last year. Adult smoking is also on a steady decline. The authors of the study however, don't believe a similar agreement will happen with alcohol companies. Instead, they advocate self-regulation.","Smoking in movies has decreased from nearly 100 appearances in 1999, to around 20 in 2006 - due to an agreement that banned tobacco companies from product placement .

The troubled city of Detroit has the rather ominous distinction of being home to the three most violent neighborhoods in America. The rankings come from a report of the 25 most dangerous neighborhoods released this week by NeighborhoodScout.com. With its violent crimes, high unemployment, dwindling population and financial crisis, Motor City was always a likely candidate to feature on such a list, but not only does it take the top three spots, it also has a neighborhood in the seventh spot too. New research to find the most dangerous neighborhoods in the entire country has found the top three are all within the troubled city of Detroit . Four Chicago neighborhoods also featured on the list, while the remainder were mainly smaller cities in the South and Midwest. Neighborhood Scout's founder Andrew Schiller said the findings - in particular the absence of New York and Los Angeles - might surprise many people. ‘So many people think, well, I live in a medium city so it can't be that bad, not like big cities like New York or Los Angeles,’ said Schiller. 'But those cities aren't that dangerous overall - of course they have dangerous neighborhoods - but overall, they aren't nearly as dangerous as places like Indianapolis.' NeighborhoodScout analyzed FBI data tracking violent crimes of homicide, forcible rape, armed robbery and aggravated assault to compile this list . Broken city: Detroit suffers from violent crime, high unemployment, a dwindling population and financial crisis . NeighborhoodScout used census tracts to define neighborhoods, excluding those with less than 800 residents. Then they analyzed FBI data tracking violent crimes of homicide, forcible rape, armed robbery and aggravated assault. Schiller also noted that rather than city centers, the neighborhoods found to have the highest incidents of crime also had high levels of vacancies and were dominated by single-family homes. While Detroit is well known as an area . of economic blight and major social issues and the number of vacant structures is estimated at 35,000, with many more vacant lots. The city's violent crime rate is also more than five times the national average, according to last year's Forbes analysis of 2011 statistics. In February Detroit earned another dubious honor when it topped Forbes’ list of the most miserable cities in the U.S. Ghost town: A wrecking crew tears down an abandoned building that once housed Motown Records from 1960-1972 on Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit . ‘Detroit's problems are hardly news. It has been in a four-decade decline paralleling the slide in the U.S. auto industry,’ according to Forbes.com, which compiles the yearly ranking. Earlier this year, a panel of experts said the automotive city was facing a fiscal emergency and potential bankruptcy, as well as a possible financial takeover by the state. Once hailed as one of the nation’s most industrious cities, Detroit has been ravaged by a perfect storm of plummeting home prices, astronomically high crime rates and a mass exodus of residents.

That's what Jockey International is hoping, now that the company has introduced JOCKEY Bra, based on a brand new sizing system focused on breast volume rather than the rigid cup and band measurement system currently used in the industry. Instead of the typical A, B, C, D, etc, cup, Jockey's Volumetric Fit System measures the volume and shape of a woman's breast plus an under-bust measurement, with the volumetric sizes running from 1 through to 10. The new system has 55 size combinations, and promises to address the long-bemoaned problem of ill-fitting bras. Cup sizes currently are based on two measurements - the breast at its fullest point, minus the rib cage measurement. If it’s a one-inch difference, it’s an A cup; a two-inch difference, a B cup, and so on. Jockey International says this equation doesn’t account for volume and different breast shapes. Good fit: Jockey's new Volumetric Fit System comes with 10 plastic cups, a measuring tape and instructions on how to find your perfect bra size . Bra sizes also vary widely from one manufacturer to the next, and from country . to country, and women's bodies and breasts often don't conform to the . arbitrary sizes offered by companies. These are the problems Jockey is seeking to solve. 'It took us eight years to develop the new Jockey bra and its revolutionary Volumetric Fit System,' said Sally Tomkins, Jockey's senior vice president of design, research and development. 'Through our research, and countless hours of testing and talking with women, we are confident we are answering women's desire for the perfect-fitting bra.' Patented: The Double Lined Contour Bra (left) and the Classic Contour Bra are two of the options in Jockey's new JOCKEY Bra range and have a patented 3-D contour design that does away with underwires . Soft support: The Classic Soft Cup Bra (left) and the Double Lined Soft Cup Bra have 'unique 3-D Inner Sling Support for a revolutionary soft cup' that has no underwire and great support . The Volumetric Fit System can be ordered from Jockey.com for $19.95 which can be redeemed as a $19.95 discount off the price of a bra. It comes in a small mesh bag and contains 10 plastic molded cups in different sizes, a measuring tape and a booklet of instructions and bra styles. Women using the system should select a cup that looks closest to their size and place it over their breast. The cup that fits is the one with the best coverage, with no gaps or 'spillage' Cups runneth over: Jockey's new bra fitting system lets women measure themselves to find their perfect fit using 10 different-sized plastic cups - if there are gaps, it's too big, if there is spillage, it's too small . Next, use the color-coded measuring tape to take a direct measurement of the under-bust area. There are seven different band sizes (30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 or 42). Price point: Like the entire JOCKEY Bra range, the Tailored Contour Bra retails for $60 . The new measuring system would result in sizes such as 1-30, 7-36 and 9-42. Jockey . says that in contrast with the 80-year-old alphanumeric measuring . system which is a pure mathematical equation, the new system takes into . account the volume of a woman's breast rather than just her . measurements. Bra shopping is notoriously . traumatic, with research showing 75 per cent of women have trouble . finding a bra that fits properly and a staggering 85 per cent are . wearing the wrong sized bra. 'Women . also dislike the bra shopping experience due to the overwhelming number . of bra choices, lack of attentive service, and complexity and variance . of proper sizing,' says the Jockey website. According to research on Jockey's website, 53 per cent of women have never been professionally fitted for a bra. The JOCKEY Bras themselves come in five . different styles so far: Classic Contour, Tailored Contour, Double-Lined . Contour, Classic-Soft Cup and Double-Lined Soft Cup and they each come . in black, white and nude colors. Jockey has also pledged not to . discontinue any of its bra styles. The JOCKEY Bras come with a patented '3-D Contour support' replacing the underwire, which 'supports, cups and shapes the breast without any poking, giving women an exceptionally comfortable fit'. Mission impossible: Many women dread bra shopping due to the 'overwhelming number of bra choices, lack of attentive service, and complexity and variance of proper sizing', according to Jockey International . Bra cup sizes as we know them were invented in 1932, and band sizes became popular in the 1940s. The sizes have barely changed since then, though the range has expanded along with the general population's weight. The originator of the bra was Parisienne Madaleine Gabeau, who received a U.S. patent on 21 November 1911 for a bra with soft cups and a metal band supporting and separating the breasts. With a price tag of $60, it remains to be seen whether or not the JOCKEY Bra and sizing system will catch on, but new adopters can rest assured that the company has a money-back satisfaction guarantee on its new bras.

Thirty people have been infected with Hepatitis A, and nine of them hospitalized, in an outbreak across five states traced to an organic frozen berry mix sold at Costco. And health officials are bracing for more cases if cafes and restaurants that bought the frozen blend used it to make smoothies, frozen bar drinks and other desserts for customers. The Food and Drug Administration and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have linked the reported illnesses to Townsend Farms Organic Anti-Oxidant Blend, a mix of berries and pomegranate seeds produced by Townsend Farms in Oregon. Outbreak: Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend of frozen berries sold through Costco stores, pictured, have been linked to an outbreak of Hepatitis A infections. The first victim got sick on April 29 . with the most recent case reported on May 17, although USA Today reports . more are expected. The victims, aged between 25 and 71 years old, live in Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and California. About 11 of 17 of those infected said they bought the berry mix at Costco, according to CNN. A Costco spokesman said that the company has removed the product from stores and is attempting to contact members who purchased the product in recent months. Infection: Costco, pictured, has pulled contaminated Townsend Farms Organic Anti-Oxidant Blend products from its shelves after it was linked to a multi-state outbreak of hepatitis A. Townsend Farms lawyer Bill Gaar said the frozen organic blend bag included pomegranate seeds sourced from Turkey, and were only used in the product associated with the outbreak. 'We do have very good records, we know where the (pomegranate seeds) came from, we're looking into who the broker is and we're sourcing it back up the food chain to get to it,' Mr Gaar said. He said Townsend Farms believes Costco is the only customer who bought the product but are checking to see if any other retailers also sold it. Contaminated: Frozen berries, pictured, produced at Townsend Farms in Oregon have been linked to an outbreak of Hepatitis A. CNN reports state health departments, the FDA and the CDC are investigating, after notifying Townsend Farms on Thursday and sending investigators to the Fairview farm. Hepatitis A is a highly infectious disease which inflames the liver, and is usually transmitted via contaminated food or water, or by someone who is infected. The Mayo Clinic website states: 'Mild cases of Hepatitis A don't require treatment, and most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage. However the World Health Organization says severe infection can lead to liver failure and death, with about 1.4 million cases of Hepatitis A annually worldwide.","Thirty people infected, nine of them hospitalized .

A survival guide for summer interns at Goldman Sachs has been posted to a blog which advises them to tell racist jokes and brag about sleeping with colleagues. The advice, written by the creators of revealing Twitter account Goldman Sachs Elevator Gossip, warns the interns taking up their position that 'the race hasn't even started yet'. The writer then includes a list of 20 tips to help them get a full-time position at the firm including: 'Don't brag about being a decent golfer. This should be a given.' Survival of the fittest: A blog offers advice for Goldman Sachs summer interns - including how to sabotage fellow interns, how to master the dress code, and how to remain in a boss's favor . The writer also talks about the 'war' you automatically engage in with fellow interns. He . suggests coming up with a 'dismissive nickname' for a fellow intern - . like Chico, Bud Fox, Fredo or Bubba - and 'hope that it catches on.' The list also suggests ways to remain in a boss's favor. 'If . your boss smokes, smoke,' it advises. But it adds that you shouldn't . buy a round of drinks if you're out with seniors, since 'you can't . afford them, and it won't score any points.' Asking . the secretary for your seniors' travel schedules helps you appear . proactive, and it also lets you know 'when you can sleep in, hit the gym, . or beat the traffic to South Hampton.' But the writer insists you must balance subservience with assertiveness. Tidbit: The advice is written by the creator of revealing Twitter account GS Elevator, which exposed outrageous conversations overheard in the banking firm's elevator . 'Don't be too good to do the coffee runs. It shows confidence,' he advises, before adding: 'Just don't f*** it up. If you can't be trusted with coffee, how can you sell bonds or manage risk.' Other tips tell interns how to sabotage a . fellow intern - by changing his screen to porsche.com or . morganstanley.com while he is away from his desk, for instance. And in terms of dress code, the advice is strict: 'Buy a decent suit,' it says. 'But no cuffed or pleated pants. And don't wear a tie unless you might have a meeting. No one likes that kind of kiss-ass.' 'Don't brag about being a decent golfer. This should be a given' The . rules on neckties are equally specific. 'Learn how to tie a double .

Several of the rules are followed by . the phrase 'you have to earn it,' pointing to the hierarchical system . in the finance world. 'Don't wear Hermes ties, ever,' stipulates rule number three. 'You have to earn it.' Rule six states: 'Keep your shoes shiny, but don't let anyone see you having your shoes shined. You have to earn it.' And the blog offers unconventional advice on how to find a mentor. 'If you went to a decent boarding school, subtly find out if anyone who matters went to the same school,' it says. 'Boom, he's your rabbi. At this point, no one cares about college credentials; it's a given.' And if your stint as a Goldman Sachs intern doesn't turn into a permanent position, do not fear, says the blog. 'There are plenty of Vineyard Vines wearing, New Canaan commuting,  Morgan Stanley name-dropping ""rainmakers"" waiting to pick you up and dust you off,' it says. 'Not making the cut at Goldman is like being traded by the Yankees.

But one YouTube prankster has travelled the world for his latest stunt - with the sole aim of making people yawn. And despite its sleepy content, the video of his adventures - ultimately aimed at making its viewers yawn too - has gone viral with more than two million hits on YouTube so far. Scroll down for video . Contagious: Prankster Roman Atwood is seen raucously yawning at a variety of global tourist destinations, including the Eiffel Tower, pictured here . Catching on: Fellow tourists are seen to yawn too once Atwood has walked past . Sleepy: The sole aim of Atwood's prank is to make viewers of the video yawn . Roman Atwood mingled with tourists at attractions across the globe and loudly yawned in the hope that it would catch on in what he describes as 'the world's most contagious prank'. The funnyman, whose other pranks include irking locals by pretending to urinate up against the ancient pyramids in Egypt, is seen raucously yawning at home on his sofa at the beginning of the video. He is then seen at a variety of the world's top tourist destinations, including the Eiffel Tower in Paris, New York's Statue of Liberty, Stonehenge in Wiltshire, the Colosseum in Rome and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota trying to get unwitting members of the public to take part in his prank. And it seems that yawning really is contagious as tourists in every destination Roman is pictured at join in and mimic his fake sleepiness. Unwitting: Roman walks past these two women who are deep in conversation and yawns and stretches loudly . Tired: Despite not paying much attention to Roman, one of the women still falls for the 'prank' and yawns in turn . Go away: Atwood is ushered away by this man who talks on his phone while the prankster yawns in his direction . Instinctive act: But despite his best efforts to ignore Roman, the man still ends up letting out a giant yawn himself . But not everyone saw the funny side of the prank. In one clip, Roman is approached by two men who accuse Roman of 'spreading germs' with his incessant yawning. One of the men tells Roman he needs to 'go home and get some rest.' Even a dog gets in on the act, following his masters yawn at the end of the clip. Trying to get a rise: Atwood covers his face in this particularly exaggerated yawn from the clip . Not amused: But not everyone sees the funny side of the prank as these two men confront Atwood and tell him to move his incessant yawning along . Contrary to common belief, yawning is not actually a precursor to sleep. It is actually said to cool the brain down and help us to stay awake and even more alert than we were. While the video only shows those around Roman falling for his 'prank', it is unclear how many times his over pronounced yawning failed to catch on - only around half of adult humans are said to be prone to contagious yawning. Two targets: Atwood attempts to get the man in the wheelchair and the woman pushing him to yawn . Gotcha: But it's the woman who falls for the prank and politely covers her face as she lets out a giant yawn . Man's best friend: The end of the video shows a man yawning while sat next to his pet . Dog tired: The hound soon follows suit and lets out its own yawn . VIDEO: The world's most contagious prank . Contrary to common misconceptions, yawning is actually designed to keep us awake rather than a precursor to sleep. Almost all animals on the planet yawn and we are even known to yawn in the womb before we are born. It is thought to cool the brain down so that it operates more effectively and makes us more alert. Keeping you up? US President Barack Obama pictured trying to politely hide a yawn . But there are several theories as to why yawning seems to be contagious. One theory is that we yawn when we see someone else doing it as we are taking part in an  ancient ritual that evolved in early man to help groups stay alert and able to detect danger. According to researchers at the University of Albany in New York, it is not catching another persons sleepiness but actually an 'empathic mechanism' designed to maintain group alertness. Another theory suggests that it could be the result of some unconscious 'herding' behaviour - a subtle way of communicating with one another and letting on that we're tired. Even snakes and birds yawn and dogs are said to yawn to remain calm in certain situations. Source: BBC .","Roman Atwood passes his yawn onto tourists in the US, UK, and France .

But now those suffering from hair loss and baldness could finally have an answer to their prayers - without resorting to a comb-over, toupee or hair transplant. A new hair product on sale in salons from this week claims to not only stop hair loss, but also stimulate new growth. The treatment Kérastase Densifique, which has been hailed as a ‘major breakthrough’, stimulates the scalp to wake up dormant follicles. Baldness cure: A new hair loss treatment claims to stimulate growth by waking up dormant follicles on the scalp . Scientists have found that many of those suffering from hair loss or balding have skin tissue in the scalp that has an oxygen deficiency – a condition called hypoxia. They have developed a molecule called stemoxydine that targets this condition by attempting to increase oxygen levels in the scalp. The increase aims to help follicles to produce thicker hair and stimulate hair growth in areas where the follicles have shut down. The Kérastase Densifique cream, which costs £285 for a three-month treatment, is applied to the hair daily. It is put into damp or dry hair using an applicator and then massaged into the scalp. The maker L’Oreal, which developed it in its hair laboratory in Paris, claim that it is clinically proven to be effective for both men and women. Root of the problem: Scientists have found that many of those suffering from hair loss or balding have skin tissue in the scalp that has an oxygen deficiency a condition called hypoxia . In a study, 101 people who used the product once a day for three months found a four per cent increase in the number of hairs they had, which represent an average of 1,700 new hairs. Patricia Pineau, head of scientific affairs at L’Oréal, said: ‘We’ve known for 100 years that hair grows and falls out.  We haven’t known what makes hair regenerate until now. ‘It is all about hair stem cell environment. In 2000, we have published the existence of two stem cell reservoirs in the hair and, more recently, we have both identified the optimal environment and designed a molecule able to favour it. ‘Kérastase Densifique is a result of this discovery that happens not very often. We have been able to develop a cosmetic product that respects the natural way hair regenerates. ‘A clinical trial has proven its efficacy on hair density - number and diameter. Kérastase Densifique will really help people who are experiencing thinning hair and less volume.’ Hairdresser and Kérastase Ambassador Luke Hersheson added: ‘It’s set to be the holy grail for a lot of women – and men.’","Kérastase Densifique has gone on sale in hair salons this week .

Even though the U.S. economy appears to be on the mend, two thirds of American adults are unhappy these days, with minorities being the most miserable of the bunch, according to a new poll. The polling company Harris Interactive surveyed online 2,345 U.S. adults between April 10-15, asking them questions to calculate their overall level of happiness. According to the findings of the poll, only a third of Americans can quality as 'very happy.' Among the most discontented group are minorities, recent college graduates and people with disabilities. Sad bunch: Harris Interactive poll has found that recent college graduates (left) and people with disabilities (right) are the least likely to quality as 'very happy' Discontented: The Happiness Index was especially low among Hispanic Americans, which may be related to the immigration debate mired in controversy . An especially deep decline in the Happiness Index was registered among Hispanic Americans over the past two years - a trend that has been partially attributed to the acrimonious debate over immigration policy. African-Americans appear to be less happy today than in 2011, with 36 per cent qualifying as very happy - down from 44 per cent two years ago. However, though the Happiness Index was down among black survey participants, they remain roughly as happy as caucasians. ‘Our happiness index offers insight into what's on the minds of Americans today and is a reflection of the state of affairs in our country,’ Regina Corso, senior vice president of the Harris Poll, said in a statement. ‘While the attitudes on the economy may be improving, we're seeing that this is not translating into an improvement in overall happiness.’ Among Americans with disabilities, the percentage of those very happy has slid from 34 to 31 per cent - another drop which may be related to cuts or feared cuts in services as a result of the recently implemented sequester. College graduates appear to be less content now than two years ago - a possible casualty of a tough job market coupled with growing doubts about the true value of higher education. While it is accepted by most people that money can't buy happiness, the survey indicates that having more of it can significantly improve one's outlook on life. Happy campers: Poll results show that those over the age of 50 are more likely to be happy than their younger counterparts . Gender gap: Men are less likely than women to quality as very happy, according to the Harris Poll . Americans earning under $50,000 in annual salary are less likely to qualify as very happy than in 2011 - down from 33 per cent to 29 per cent among those earning less than $35,000, and from 35 per cent to 32 per cent among those earning between $35,000-$49,999. Old age is rarely associated with joy or exuberance, but poll results show that those over the age of 50 are more likely to be happy than their younger counterparts. About 41 per cent of adults over age 65 rank highest on the Happiness Index, while the least likely to be happy are those between the age of 30-39, with about 28 per cent of this group qualifying as very happy.

Full House star Bob Saget and Survivor host Jeff Probst - but neither . ever called her again. Now the guys have given their take on their experience with the TV journalist and talk show host, now 56. In an endearing email to Us Weekly, Probst revealed a mutual friend first tried to set them up in 2001, but 'the timing never worked out'. It wasn't meant to be: Katie Couric and Jeff Probst have both given their take on their first - and only - date . The 51-year-old continued: 'A few years later the same friend connected us again and this time the date was set. The next time I was in New York we would have dinner.' Not interested: She also went to dinner once with Bob Saget . 'What I remember most about the date is how nervous I was and how little I offered to the conversation,' Probst recalled. 'It was like I forgot how to go on a date. Like I was 14. We talked a bit about her kids and the challenges of being a parent to teenagers, and we talked a bit about our careers and lifestyles but we never got much beyond the surface."" He insists he 'would have definitely asked for a second date' and added that 'it wasn't lack of interest' on his part. 'The only reason I didn't call back was the date was set up through her assistant and I never got her number. It felt weird to call her assistant for a second date,' he said. 'So it never had a chance to be a romance. Who knows what might have been? But it's a date I definitely remember! I mean, come on, it's Katie Couric!'

David Crystal, professor of linguistics of Bangor University, explained how people are dropping letters when typing words into search engines . Common misspellings of English words could be acceptable within a few years because they are used online, a linguist has said. ‘Rhubarb’ could change to ‘rubarb’, ‘receipt’ to ‘receit’ and ‘necessary’ to ‘neccesary’. Simpler online forms of ‘irritating’ complex words are starting to affect mainstream usage,  linguistics professor David Crystal told the Hay Literary Festival. He started monitoring the word ‘rhubarb’ ten years ago by typing the correct spelling into a search engine, then the error ‘rubarb’. He said: ‘I got millions of hits for rhubarb with the “h”, and just one or two without it.’ A few years later, ‘rubarb’ got ‘hundreds of hits, and then a  few years later hundreds of  thousands of hits,’ he said. ‘Rhubarb is still the dominant one by a factor of 50. But think ahead 50 years . . . and rhubarb and rubarb will be equal.’ Professor Crystal, of Bangor University, said the ‘h’ is illogical and was not used in Middle English. He predicted more changes, saying: ‘Is it one “c” and two “s”s in necessary or two “c”s and  one “s”? . . . Over time one  spelling will emerge, probably a simpler one. ‘The internet will influence spelling. It will get rid of some letters that irritate us, the letters that instinctively we feel shouldn’t be there. But it will take time.’ At the festival, Simon Horobin, a professor of English at Oxford, proposed spellings of ‘they’re’, ‘their’ and ‘there’ be standardised and told ‘grammar police’ to relax over apostrophe usage. Professor Crystal also criticised Education Secretary Michael Gove and plans to make schools concentrate on teaching the phonics. He said the move was 'absurd' because the English language was a mix of phonics and words.

"Libby Alvarez Phelps is the daughter of Fred Phelps, who founded the fundamentalist Westboro Baptist Church and believes homosexuality is the root of all evil . She hasn't spoken to her family since she left the church four years ago, but can see them on their daily walks holding up 'God Hates F**s' signs . By . Catherine Townsend . PUBLISHED: . 12:34 EST, 16 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:51 EST, 16 April 2013 . As a member of the fundamentalist anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church, Libby Phelps Alvarez spent her childhood picketing funerals of servicemen with signs like 'God Hates Dead Soldiers'. Now she has left the group founded by her grandfather Fred Phelps, and is working for a nonprofit organization that celebrates homosexuality. According to the New York Post, Alvarez has agreed to work on anti-bullying initiatives with Planting Peace, based inside the rainbow-colored Equality House that sits across the street from her family's church headquarters. Peaceful protest: Planting Peace founder Aaron Jackson (left) will be working with Libby Phelps Alvarez (right) in the rainbow-colored Equality House . Alvarez was showing a cousin the colorful house when Planting Peace co-founder Aaron Jackson walked outside and introduced himself. Jackson, 31, says that he painted the house to protest the . Westboro clan's outspoken anti-gay preaching. Over the years, Alvarez had gone from scrunching her nose at homosexual couples to an attitude of acceptance. 'I don’t really care if somebody is gay,' Alvarez says. 'I still believe in God. I just think that he’s more forgiving.' Over dinner, she decided to become involved . with his anti-bullying campaign - even though this would mean working across the street from her parents, whom she hadn't seen in four years. But she doesn't bother to approach them, because she knows that she has been frozen out for her view. Painting protest: Aaron Jackson painted the two-bedroom rainbow-colored house across the street from the Westboro Baptist Church to protest the church's actions . Facing conflict: Libby Phelps shows off her skills while helping paint the nonprofit charity organization, which is located across the street from the Westboro Babtist Church headquarters . Alvarez's upbringing was surreal. 'Gramps, as I called him, is a Southern gentleman,' Alvarez told . reporter Sara Stewart. 'You just want to be in . his orbit. But with Gramps and my dad -  Fred Phelps Jr -  the only way to get . their . love and affection was to talk about hell.' 'I remember sitting by the . pool in the backyard when I was young, writing in my pink notebook about . hell and the descriptions of it. Gramps came up to me and kissed me on . the forehead and said, ""I love you, I love you, I love you"" three times in a row.' The Westboro Baptist Church, which is . believed to have just a few dozen members, was founded in Topeka, Kansas in 1955 by Fred Phelps. But Alvarez says he wasn't always a fundamentalist. Back in the 1980s, Phelps was a Democrat and civil . rights lawyer who, at one point, ran for governor and entertained Al Gore at home. When Alvarez was eight, she says her . grandfather visited a park and . claimed that gay men had propositioned her cousins. Counter protest: Planting Peace, which supports orphanages in the developing world, has attracted support from activists across the country . After . that, he became fixated on homosexuality as the root of all evil. Over . poached eggs in the morning, she would hear about how gay people are . 'dooming the nation'. Then . the family started picketing: First every weekend, and eventually every . day. The women were required to submit and cover their heads during . sermons, which would always come back to the subject of how gay people . were 'dooming' the nation. 'With Gramps and my dad -  Fred Phelps Jr -  the only way to get . their . love and affection was to talk about hell' Holidays like Christmas and Easter were . deemed 'too pagan', so the Westboro kids were only allowed to celebrate . birthdays. They attended public school, but since they weren't allowed . to go to dances their social lives largely revolved around picketing. 'We would use it to go on . vacations. You go, you picket, you do some fun stuff. I have a picture . of me in Hawaii with two signs: “God hates f **s” and “God hates . Hawaii,""' Alvarez says.  'Why does he hate Hawaii? Because we wanted to go there!' After 9/11, Alvarez says she was horrified - until she came home and found everyone 'celebrating, like ""This is awesome! God is punishing this nation!""' Bible Baptist: Pastor Fred Phelps founded the Westboro Baptist Church and believes that homosexuality is the root of all evil in America . In . 2008, she graduated from the University of Kansas Medical Center with a . doctorate in physical therapy. One of her first patients was a man . named Logan. She thought he was cute, but in order to avoid being . accused of 'lusting', kept her crush a secret. Then . in 2009, Alvarez took a photo of herself and her sister Sara while . picketing Puerto Rico. When she showed her grandfather, he said the . girls looked 'like models'. But the reaction from the family was immediate: 'I showed up, and 30 church members had filled up the big game room. Like a show was being put on or something,' Alvarez recalls. 'And they started in: The . initial issue was the bikini, but the bigger problem was the way I was . reacting. Because I had stood up for myself.' Going abroad: Since leaving Westboro Libby Phelps Alvarez has been on several trips with her husband Logan, since church members were not allowed to leave the country . Alvarez left the church on Friday the 13th. The next few months traumatic:She got a haircut for the first time in her life, but also believed that the plane she got on may crash because God wanted her to die. She ran into the cute former patient Logan on the street, and once they started dating he told her he didn't care about her past. They married in 2011 in Cozumel, and since her parents weren't at the wedding she walked herself down the aisle. 'I felt lonely - everybody wants their dad to walk them down the aisle - and I could have asked a cousin,' she says, 'but I figured, I’ll be a strong . independent woman and do this by myself.' 'I want my cousins and my nieces and nephews to see that the world isn’t . mean and hateful and evil and full of vicious people' In the past few years, around 20 church members have left - most in their teen and early twenties. Alvarez knows that her parents will see her interviews, and holds out hope that they may leave as well. She also says that her views on homosexuality have changed - now she doesn't care as long as they are good people. And she still believes in God, but now sees him as more forgiving. 'I want my cousins and my nieces and nephews to see that the world isn’t . mean and hateful and evil and full of vicious people. We were told . there’s going to be heartache and sorrow and disease and sadness in the . world outside the church,' she says. 'But . overall, it’s a fun adventure.'","Libby Alvarez Phelps is the daughter of Fred Phelps, who founded the fundamentalist Westboro Baptist Church and believes homosexuality is the root of all evil .

These are the Chinese migrant families who are forced to live in old shipping containers due to a lack of housing. For just £50 a month, they rent out their metal homes on the outskirts of Shanghai. Millions of rural migrants have flocked to China's fast developing cities in recent decades, but many are unable to join the property ladder as house prices have boomed and rents have soared. Left behind: The containers, which house different families, were set up by the landlord, who charges a rent of 500 yuan (£50) per month . Risk: A similar container village in Pudong was pulled down by the Chinese authorities in 2011 because it was too 'dangerous' Struggling: There are 18 shipping container homes in this 'village' on the edge of Shanghai .

The old cargo . containers were reportedly rescued by a man in his 70s, known simply as . the 'old man', who acts as landlord after he found them discarded on the . side of a road. All are equipped with doors, windows, electricity and water and Li said she feels safe. She . has divided her 15 square metre home into a small supermarket, selling . food, drinks and other daily necessities, and a living room with a bed, . sofa and even a television. Safe: All the containers are equipped with water, electricity, doors and windows . Overcrowded: Shanghai has a population of around 23million but many migrants can't afford housing . Established: The shipping containers are believed to have housed workers for more than 10 years . Li . told Shanghai Daily: 'It was more than 10 years ago that the 'old man' bought the containers from local customs. He planned to use them as . warehouses on the land he rented from the government but later decided . to lease them out to migrant workers. Another . female resident living in the container said the 'old man' took pity on . some migrant workers who survived by collecting garbage and charged . them very low rent. 'Many . people ask me how I feel living in a container. I say it's quite fine as . I've never lived in an apartment in the city,' said Li. 'The iron containers are quite solid and I do not have to worry about leakages during rain or the roof collapsing.' A similar container village existed in suburban Gaoqiao Town in Pudong in 2011. But last May, Gaoqiao government officials claimed the container village 'posed danger to residents.'

SAS sniper: Sergeant Danny Nightingale, 38, arrives at Bulford Military Court Centre in Wiltshire with his wife Sally to plead not guilty . An SAS sniper faces a retrial over illegally possessing a pistol and ammunition - despite a last-minute claim prosecutors acted improperly by consulting on the case. Sergeant Danny Nightingale, 38, today pleaded not guilty at Bulford Military Court Centre in Wiltshire to illegally possessing a Glock 9mm pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition. He was convicted and sentenced to military detention last year for keeping the Iraqi pistol as a war trophy before having his sentence reduced and conviction subsequently quashed by Court of Appeal judges. At a preparatory hearing to discuss the future of the case today, Judge Advocate Jeff Blackett said there was no abuse of process relating to content in emails apparently leaked by a Ministry of Defence source, which were referred to for the first time at the hearing. He said: ‘Provided I am satisfied that there has been no bad faith or dishonesty and that the exercise of a prosecutorial discretion has been conscientiously undertaken, I should direct that the matter proceeds to trial. ‘I am so satisfied. There is no abuse of process and I dismiss the defendant’s application to stay these proceedings.’ Sgt Nightingale’s counsel, Simon McKay, told the court about emails leaked by an MoD ‘whistle-blower’ which he said appeared to show the Director of Service Prosecutions consulting the military ‘chain of command’ - the Adjutant General’s office - on whether or not to pursue the case against the soldier. Mr McKay said: ‘There is an issue of disclosure. In theory the effect of this meeting is rather like the Director of Public Prosecutions saying to the head of the Metropolitan Police: “I’m thinking of charging one of your officers, I’d be interested in your views, thank you very much”.’ Family: Sergeant Danny Nightingale is pictured with his wife Sally and his children Mara (left) and Alys (right) However, prosecutors said there was nothing ‘improper’ with the conduct alleged in the email. Counsel . Timothy Cray told the court: ‘If there was a basis, for a second, to . think that the Director of Service Prosecutions said to the AG: “Tell me . what you want me to do, I will roll over and go with the army’s view”, . then there is something in my friend’s point.’ But he said there was nothing in the evidence which suggested a breach of regulations. Sgt . Nightingale, from the Duke of Lancaster regiment, appeared in court . wearing full military uniform and answered ‘not guilty’ to two charges . put to him today. The trial is expected to start on July 1. Retrial: Sergeant Danny Nightingale is pictured (left) in his SAS sniper gear and (right) arriving at the court today . His family said outside court that they were ‘bitterly disappointed’ with the judge’s ruling. 'Sal and the family have been amazing, strong, very robust. I think a lot of people would have crumbled' Sergeant Danny Nightingale . Describing his court ordeal so far, the soldier said today: ‘I wouldn't wish it on anyone's family - it's horrible. That's not just for Sally, myself and the kids, it's on the wider family. It's hard. ‘Thanks to everybody, the family who have come from around the world for this, thanks to the public and to the media who have been very supportive throughout.’ Paying tribute to his partner, he added: ‘Without her, without Sal and the family, I wouldn't be here now. They've been amazing, strong, very robust. I think a lot of people would have crumbled.’ Couple: Sergeant Danny Nightingale said his wife Sally and family have been 'amazing, strong, very robust' Mrs Nightingale said: ‘Our lives are on hold completely.

Every day is consumed by this case, all our conversations with our friends and family are consumed by this case' Sally Nightingale . She said the financial pressures were being supported by a charitable organisation, which was helping raise money for their fight to clear the soldier's name. She added: ‘We want a fair trial and to feel Danny has been given a fair trial. We're obviously bitterly disappointed today that we are going ahead with a re-trial now. ‘But in some respects there are still a lot of unanswered questions for us. Danny's pleaded not guilty today and we're still looking for the right outcome.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Sergeant pleads not guilty to illegally possessing pistol and 300 rounds .

A grandfather could be forced to sell his home to pay £40,000 in legal costs after losing a High Court battle over parking tickets. Barry Moss launched a one-man crusade against his local council and successfully appealed against dozens of tickets for friends, family – and even strangers. The retired roofer argued that Bolton Council’s parking bays and signage did not comply with Department for Transport regulations. But when he took the council’s auditors, KPMG, to the High Court to claim some of the authority’s income had therefore been obtained illegally, he lost the case. Costly defeat: When Barry Moss took the council's auditors to court to argue that parking bays and signage did not comply with regulations, he lost the case . Now, KPMG’s solicitors have said he must sell his four-bedroom home in order to recover £40,000 costs, plus interest. Mr Moss, 66, said he was being punished for standing up for motorists. He added: ‘It would be terrible if we had to sell the house because my wife Aline and I built it ourselves in 1993. It means everything to us. ‘I regret taking them to court now because of all the stress and anxiety it is causing my wife, but I know it was the right thing to do. What these councils are doing is wrong.’ The father of three appears in a BBC1 documentary tonight which follows several people who have taken on Britain’s councils over parking fines. Parking Mad also includes a man who challenged £80,000 of parking tickets and a masked motorcycle gang which roam London’s suburbs alerting drivers to CCTV camera cars, which catch people driving in bus lanes or breaching no left or right-turn restrictions. Standing up for motorists: Mr Moss features in a documentary which follows several people who have taken on councils over parking fines (file picture) Mr Moss began his campaign after he received a parking ticket five years ago for over-staying in a pay-and-display parking bay by four minutes when he had been delayed with an injured knee. He appealed but was apparently told by Bolton Council that, unless an ambulance had been called, he would have to pay the fine. Two months later, fuelled by the refusal, he successfully appealed his nephew’s parking ticket on the grounds that the markings near a new roundabout were confusing. ‘But that wasn’t enough for me’, he said. ‘I wanted refunds to be given to the other people who had been fined in that spot too, which they later got.’ As news of his appeals began to spread, he received requests for help from people all over the country. ‘I did lots of research and found councils everywhere were issuing tickets illegally,’ he said. The documentary claims councils are issuing more parking tickets than ever. It estimates they raised more than £700million in revenue last year from parking tickets.","Barry Moss successfully appealed against dozens of tickets for friends, family - and even strangers .

Kobe Bryant is in a court battle to try to keep his mother from auctioning off personal mementos worth upwards of $1.5 million from his high school days in Pennsylvania and his early years with the Los Angeles Lakers. A New Jersey auction house filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Camden on Thursday for the right to sell the items after the NBA star's lawyers wrote the firm telling it to cancel a planned June auction. According to court filings, Pamela Bryant struck a deal with Goldin Auctions in Berlin and received $450,000 up front which she intended to use for a new home in Nevada. For sale: An advertisement for an auction of items belonging to Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is seen just before the basketball star ordered the auction house to stop . Deal: A lawsuit by the New Jersey auction house claims that Kobe Bryant's mother Pamela Bryant, seen beside his father Joe Bryant, already struck a deal with them for the items' sale . The disagreement is a high-value, high-profile version of a question many families face: Can Mom get rid of the stuff a grown child left at home? In this case, the 900 mementos happen to be worth upward of $1.5 million. Among the first 100 or so items Pamela Bryant intends to sell: the NBA star's jerseys, practice gear and sweatsuits from Lower Merion High School; varsity letters; a trophy for being the outstanding player at the 1995 Adidas ABCD basketball camp; and a signed basketball from the 2000 NBA championship game. And then there are rings, for the 1996 Pennsylvania high school championship, a pair that the Lakers made for Bryant's parents for the 2000 NBA championship and one from the 1998 NBA All-Star game. According to court filings, Pamela Bryant struck a deal in January with Goldin Auctions in Berlin, N.J., which earlier this year sold a rare Honus Wagner baseball card for a record $2.1 million. Gifted: A Los Angeles Lakers championship ring given by Kobe to his father Joe Bryant is seen among the items the auction house hopes to sell . Fair game: Two Lower Merion High School basketball jerseys worn by Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant are seen for sale though Bryant contends that his mother doesn't have the right to sell the collectibles . Price tag: The 900 items belonging to Bryant, seen with his wife Vanessa at a cancer research benefit on Thursday, could bring in upward of $1.5 million . In its court filings, Goldin says Pamela Bryant told the auction house that she asked her son five years ago what he wanted to do with the items that were in her home. 'Kobe Bryant indicated to Pamela Bryant that the items belonged to her and that he had no interest in them,' the auction house's attorneys wrote. So she put them in a $1,500-per-month New Jersey storage unit. The challenge came Tuesday when Goldin sent a news release announcing the auction. By day's end, Kobe Bryant's lawyer had sent a cease-and-desist letter telling the auction house to call off the sale and return the items to him. Kenneth Goldin, owner of the auction house, says he can't cancel the auction because he's already advanced $450,000 to Bryant's mother and put money into advertising the auction. Kobe Bryant's lawyer Mark Campbell said in a statement, 'Mr. Bryant's personal property has ended up in the possession of someone who does not lawfully own it. We look forward to resolving this legal matter through the legal system.' Bryant has had a sometimes icy relationship with his mother and father, Joe 'Jellybean' Bryant, a former pro basketball player who is now coaching in Thailand.","Auction house has filed a lawsuit after basketball great ordered them to stop .

Red squirrels can jump up to 20ft through tree canopies when they spot food, which helps explain why  Hazel appears to be sailing through the air. As for the pickpocketing, it’s a trick she has learned because rangers at Escot park, in East Devon, carry nuts with them especially for the eight red squirrels who live in an enclosure there. The squirrels have even started pickpocketing visitors – although it’s unclear how many snacks they’ve managed to get their paws on. Rangers have excused Hazel’s behaviour because they believe she is pregnant and gathering food ahead of giving birth. Red squirrels are extinct in Devon but John-Michael Kennaway, whose family has owned the estate for 200 years, has helped to establish a small conservation area for them on his land and hopes to one day release them into the wild near Land’s End. Phew: Landing complete, cheeky Hazel prepares to hunt for nuts in the ranger's pockets . Getting warm: Hazel peeks inside Ms Sissons's pockets before finding the nuts carried to feed the eight red squirrels who live in the enclosure at Escot park in East Devon.

Hazel . was born in 2011, in the enclosure at Escot, which is surrounded by . 20ft of sheet metal to keep out grey squirrels. She breeds with her . partner Big Red. Mr Kennaway . said: ‘Hazel is the matriarchal type and was one of the first squirrels . here, so she is also one of the braver ones. ‘All . the squirrels here are used to humans and really tame. They know all . the keepers and will happily forage in their pockets for food. ‘They even have a check in visitors’ pockets despite us not encouraging them to feed the squirrels.’","Hazel the red squirrel likes to take the aerial route to collect her hazelnuts .

A hungover father woke from a heavy drinking session to find a 10ft python which he had drunkenly bought from a gypsy the previous evening trying to eat his friend. Dwayne Matthews, 29, found the huge snake 'rearing up with its jaws open' ready to pounce on his friend who was asleep on the sofa. Matthews had bought the 14kg beast, called Bruce, the night before from a traveller with the intention of selling it on to fund his new guttering business. Horror: A hungover father woke from a heavy drinking session to find this 10ft python called Bruce - which he had drunkenly bought from a gypsy the previous evening - trying to eat his friend . After waking to find the python rearing up in an S-shape, panicking Matthews managed to throw a blanket over the snake before bundling it into a glass cage. The next day he tried to flog the giant African rock snake to a local reptile shop who called police when they became suspicious. Matthews was handed an eight week prison sentence suspended for two years when he admitted receiving stolen goods at Coventry Magistrates Court last Friday. The court heard the python had been stolen along with eight others from an out-house in Hillfields, Coventry. Speaking about the incident on January 11, Richard Baker, defending, told the court: 'Mr Matthews was drinking at a house in Willenhall with friends. 'A van pulled up and a traveller offered for sale this 10 to 15ft-long rock snake. Worrying: Dwayne Matthews, 29, found the huge snake 'rearing up with its jaws open' ready to pounce on his friend who was asleep on the sofa . 'In his wisdom, and no doubt egged on by his inebriated friends, he decided it would be a good idea to buy it and sell it. 'The next morning he realised it hadn’t been such a good idea. 'He got up, went into the lounge, where the snake was being kept, to find one of his friends asleep on the sofa and this snake rearing up at him in an S-shape, its jaws open like a cobra. 'Instead of running out of the house, as some would have done, and leaving his friend to his fate, he apprehended this snake. 'He ran upstairs, got a quilt and thew it over the snake to subdue it and put it back in the tank. 'He didn’t decide to get rid of it by dumping it in a bin, he was doing the best he could to remedy the situation. 'After going to the shop they were going to give it to Twycross Zoo.' Police warned local stores about the raid and when Matthews attempted to offload the snake to KBN Reptiles they contacted detectives. African rock snakes, the world’s third largest snake, are constrictors which attack animals as big as crocodiles and antelopes, suffocating them in their coils before swallowing them whole. One even devoured a ten-year-old boy in South Africa in 2007. Sentencing Matthews, magistrates said: 'This was a bit of a foolhardy enterprise.' Matthews was also told to pay £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge and ordered to undergo eight weeks supervision. The python was later reunited with his owner, David Chance, 24, from Hillfields. Mr Chance said: 'We normally feed him a dead rabbit one week and a dead rat the next. 'He’s usually so gentle and but whoever took him had handled him wrong. He had two holes in his head and he was badly bruised.'","Dwayne Matthews, 29, found the huge .

Iranian-born tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz is looking to sell the freehold for 250,000 properties, which represents one per cent of the UK's entire housing stock. The sale has been exclusively targeted at sovereign wealth funds, according to the FT. Property magnate Vincent Tchenguiz has put his entire property portfolio up for sale, and is looking for around £3 billion for it . Forty per cent of the homes and apartments are in the South East of England, with 15,000 properties alone in London. Mr Tchenguiz is acting on behalf of the Tchenguiz Family Trust and has spoken to investment bank Lazard to help sell the portfolio, which comes with £2 billion worth of debts. The homes have an . average remaining lease of 60 years, after which the properties will . revert back to the freehold owner or be re-leased. Mr Tchenguiz told the FT the portfolio would give any buyer a safe and long-running exposure to UK house price growth. He said . there had been 'several expressions of interest in the portfolio'. He . added that he had not decided what he would use the proceeds of the sale . for. The good life: Vincent Tchenguiz and his brother Robert's wife Heather Bird . Mr Tchenguiz, along with his brother Robert, were arrested in March 2011 as . part of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, into the . collapse of Icelandic bank Kaupthing. Robert Tchenguiz was the bank's biggest shareholder, and had been loaned £1.7 billion by the bank. They were questioned for 13 hours, and hundreds of documents and computer files were seized. They were eventually released without charge. Both brothers have brought judicial reviews against the search and arrests warrants granted to the SFO and City of London Police. Warrants . for the brothers were quashed in December following the SFO's admission . that errors had been made in obtaining search warrants to raid Mr Tchenguiz's London offices. The 250,000 properties up for sale equates to an incredible one per cent of the total UK housing market . The warrants were quashed and the seized material was returned. Mr Tchenguiz is now seeking £100 million damages from the SFO for the damage he says has been caused to his reputation and business. He has dismissed the investigation as a 'fishing expedition'. Mr Tchenguiz is known for his love of parties which are adorned by good-looking young women. He was actually due to hold one such party on his 130ft yacht on the day he was arrested in December. One one occasion Mr Tchenguiz sent all the girls at one party with £2,000 spending money each to go on a shopping trip in St Tropez. He has been in the property business since 1988 with his brother and has homes in Mayfair, Cape Town and St Tropez. Tchenguiz also owns 10 Hilton hotels and has a joint property venture with Tesco.

Helen Mann, 43, a primary school head teacher who killed herself in her office less than six months after starting the job at Sytchampton Endowed First School, Worcestershire . A headmistress who feared her school could lose its ‘outstanding’ Ofsted ranking was found hanged on the premises, an inquest heard yesterday. Helen Mann, 43, was discovered on the first day of the new half-term, just seven months in to her first headship. The mother of two had been ‘struggling profoundly with her work’ and had also been left ‘tearful’ after a governors’ meeting in which it was agreed to make a part-time teacher redundant. She confessed to the teacher, Angela Mercer, that she found the task ‘overwhelming’, and became even more anxious when the teacher told her she would lodge a claim for unfair dismissal. Mrs Mann died on November 5 last year, seven months after starting at Sytchampton Endowed First School in the Worcestershire village. Dr Stephanie Gait, the school’s chairman of governors, told the hearing that within a month of Mrs Mann starting, she was told that the school was likely to be downgraded by Ofsted the next time it faced inspection. The warning came in a report from the local authority’s ‘school improvement adviser’ following a two-day visit to the 80-pupil primary. The inquest at Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire, heard that the school had been ranked as ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in its previous three or four inspections, but had been without a permanent head for five terms before Mrs Mann started. Dr Gait told the court Mrs Mann was ‘very concerned about whenever our next Ofsted review would be’. She added: ‘She was concerned that it wouldn’t be classified as “outstanding” if they were to come in soon. That had been mentioned in at least one governors’ meeting and we all said that we understood this would be the case but not through any fault of hers.’ Tragic: Mrs Mann with children at Sytchampton Endowed First School, Worcestershire . Dr Gait said that while Mrs Mann was . ‘bright-eyed and bushy-tailed’ when she joined the school, she appeared . exhausted rather than rested when she returned after the summer break. Mrs Mann’s impressive start at the school had been ‘blighted’ by the upset she felt at having to dismiss Mrs Mercer, she said. Mrs Mercer said she found out she was . to lose her job only after her son was told by a pupil during a karate . lesson at the school hall one evening last May. She said: ‘I went to see Mrs Mann and she was clearly distressed. She was concerned for me, but also she found it overwhelming.

Mrs Rowan said she had been off sick with . post-traumatic stress disorder since the discovery of Mrs Mann’s body. Mrs Mann was signed off sick just three weeks into the autumn term after collapsing in a meeting. The home of Helen Mann, 43. Her inquest heard that she was concerned . that if an Ofsted inspection was imminent, the school would lose its 'outstanding' rating . A month later, at the end of . half-term, she attended a meeting to discuss a phased return to work . after the following week’s holiday. Jacqueline Stanley, who had been the . head’s teaching assistant, described her appearance as ‘dreadful’ and . said: ‘It was lovely to see her (back in school) but she looked so ill. ‘My thoughts were, “Oh my goodness – you should not be coming back to work’.” The hearing continues.","Body of Helen Mann, 43, was found on November 5 last year .

A musician suspected of being a violent kidnapper has been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act today after five police officers were allegedly mauled by his dog during a raid. Pierre Robinson, 25, will appear in court this afternoon accused of 'allowing the dog to be dangerously out of control' outside a house in Albert Square, east London. He is also accused of kidnapping and GBH with intent, relating to an incident on March 14 in Newham, police said. Five policemen were in hospital last night after being savaged by the animal, and were said to have ‘life-changing’ wounds as serious as those seen after a shootout. One officer had his arm broken between the animal’s jaws, while others had chunks of flesh torn from their legs and arms. Some will require plastic surgery, and one could lose several fingers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Savage: Mobile phone footage shows a Met Police officer having to to take evasive action on a wall, while another is set upon by the crazed animal . Under attack: The officer continues to struggle against the violent dog as his colleague can do nothing but look on in terror . Lashing out: A stunned local resident in East London perches on a wall as two police officers are savaged by the animal yards away . Neutralised: Camera phone footage shows the moment the dog was shot by armed police after a bloody street battle where the animal savaged five officers . A police marksman brought the carnage . to an end when he blasted the dog four times with a shotgun after it was . cornered in the street. Robinson now faces four charges at Thames Magistrates' Court, including possession of a pit bull dog, contrary to section one of the Dangerous Dogs Act. The second allegation states he allowed his dog to be dangerously out of control in injuring five people. He also faces the kidnapping and GBH with intent charges. Scotland Yard has admitted it failed to pick up on intelligence that the animal lived at the property. The 9am swoop was part of Operation Big Wing, a major Scotland Yard purge on wanted suspects across the capital. The 48-hour operation saw hundreds of officers carrying out searches for people wanted by police or who had failed to appear at court. Crazed: Armed police had to shoot the animal four times before it was finally dead . Running for cover: The dog, whose exact breed is yet to be revealed, mauls the leg of a Met Police officer . Alarm: Residents in Newham, East London, said they heard voices shouting for help as the dog went on the rampage outside . Battle: Officers who eventually restrained the dog had to shoot it four times before it finally gave in . Blood-stained: Officers guard the scene where earlier five police constables were savaged while executing a raid . Mauling: Neighbours heard screams just after 9.30am this morning as the crazed dog savaged the officers in Newham . Neighbours revealed they had reported . the animal, described as a brown dobermann/pitbull cross called Poison, . to the council several times. They said it was responsible for other . attacks, including one in which a builder was pulled from his bicycle . and mauled so badly ‘it looked like he was being eaten alive’. The attack took place on a residential . street in Stratford, east London, where patches of dried blood remain . visible along a 30ft stretch of the road. Witnesses said the dog ran . free after a team searching for the man broke down the door of a terraced house. Mobile phone footage taken by a . passer-by shows the animal pouncing on one policeman and biting his arm. The officer tries to fight the dog off by grabbing at its neck – but . the animal is too strong. At one point, it clamps its jaws so . tightly around the man’s limb that it is lifted off the ground when he . tries to shake it off. A colleague is seen climbing on to a wall to . escape the animal. Residents in Albert Square, Newham, said the dog has attacked before - mauling a cyclist, last summer. Pregnant Rehema Nyange said locals had repeatedly called Newham Council. But nothing was done. ‘When I saw it in the street, I . would always run away. I was scared. There are people with children on . this street and there's a school close by. It could easily have attacked . anybody,' she said. I'm glad it's finally gone.’ Speaking about the attack she . witnessed last September the 30-year-old said: ‘It attacked a guy as he . rode his bicycle to work. The dog was running around the street. Then it got the man's leg. It bit him so bad. ‘It must have took a chunk out of . it as when the paramedics came they had to cut his trousers off to get . to it. It was a big wound. ‘He was crying like a baby but people were too scared to go out and help him in case the dog turned on them.’ A Newham Council spokesman said: . 'On 28 April 2011, the council investigated a complaint that a dog had . bitten a cyclist in Albert Square. 'On 6 May 2011, the council's animal welfare officers conducted an initial visit to the property but there was no response. 'This case was discussed by police and the council in June 2011. 'As this is now subject to a criminal investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.' The dog was finally cornered by a . dozen officers who arrived from a nearby station armed with riot . shields. Colleagues from the Metropolitan Police’s CO19 armed unit then . arrived and shot it. Dennis Clarke, 71, said he called . Newham Council three years ago to register his fears but was told . officials could not do anything until the dog bit someone. Describing . the latest attack, he said: ‘The first I knew was when I heard someone . yelling: “Help! Help!” ‘I came out my front door, and I could see the dog had the police officer’s leg and it wouldn’t let go. It was hanging off him.’ Student Gemma Smith, 27, added: ‘I . woke up to screaming and I thought someone had been stabbed.’ She said . officers told residents to go inside once they cornered the animal. ‘I . heard gun shots. When I looked out of the window, the dog was shaking on . the ground.’ A police source said four of the five . officers suffered ‘life-changing injuries’, and that one may need to . have one or more fingers amputated. ‘They have suffered some really . nasty injuries; broken bones, gashes that will need dozens of stitches . and even plastic surgery,’ he said. ‘The injuries are as bad as being . shot. It has taken out huge chunks of flesh.’ All five were said to be in a stable . condition at the Royal London Hospital last night. The Met confirmed last night a . 25-year-old man arrested at the scene was being questioned over the . attack, who has now been named. Newham Council confirmed it had . investigated a complaint that the dog had attacked a cyclist last April, . and said the case was discussed with police in June. An inquiry is . under way to establish why officers did not know the dog was in the . property. Under . the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 (and as amended in 1997) it is illegal to . own any Specially Controlled Dogs without specific exemption from a . court. The dogs have to be . muzzled and kept on a lead in public, they must be registered and . insured, neutered, and microchipped. The Act also bans the breeding, . sale and exchange of these dogs, even if they are on the Index of . Exempted Dogs. Four types in particular were identified by the Act: . The . Act also covers cross breeds of these dog. Dangerous dogs are . classified by 'type', not by breed label.

Hundreds of animal welfare supporters marched through Westminster today in protest at Government plans to cull thousands of badgers. Queen guitarist Brian May and Springwatch presenter Bill Oddie led calls for the plan - hatched to stop the spread of bovine TB - to be abanoned. A group of protesters set fire to a pile of newspapers, causing smoke to drift over the grounds of the Houses of Parliament. Scroll down for video . Queen star Brian May joins protesters in a march through Westminster today in a last minute bid to stop the cull of 5,000 badgers . Nature broadcaster Bill Oddie was also at the march ahead of the start of two pilot cull schemes in Gloucestershire and Somerset . There was anger in the air in Westminster and police moved in after a pile of newspapers was set on fire . They chanted 'your cull, your lies, your greed' and 'shame on Defra'. Police officers arrived after a few minutes to put the fire out. The . cull is designed to run for six weeks in order to kill at least 70 per . cent of badgers in each area. In total about 5,000 animals will die. Trained . marksmen will either shoot them with rifles or shotguns in fields or after they have been . trapped in cages. Dogs on leashes will be . used to find injured badgers but will not be allowed to drive them from . below ground. A government agency will carry out sample post mortem examinations to see if the badgers have been shot humanely. If the cull is deemed a success in reducing TB infection rates, further culls will be rolled out in other areas. The protests were made as two pilot kills in bovine TB hotspot areas in Gloucestershire Somerset were due to start. If successful, the Government plans to . roll out culling more widely in a bid to stop the disease, which is . spread between badgers and livestock and between cattle. But experts, including scientists . behind the long-term trial, have raised concerns the policy will have . 'unimpressive' results in reducing TB and suggested it does not make . economic sense. Mr May, a long-time supporter of the . campaign to spare badgers from execution, said: 'The great bit of new . information is it has now been demonstrated that the cull cannot make . economic sense. It will lose the taxpayer money rather than save it. 'That was really the last shred of reason that you could give for this cull going ahead. 'It is a very good time for Mr Cameron to reconsider and withdraw from this monstrous cull, in the public interest.' The protesters say there is no evidence a cull will help eradicate the spread of bovine TB to cattle and fear it will wipe out entire populations of badgers in affected areas . The badgers will be killed either in fields or after they have been trapped in cages by trained marksmen . Mr May said the cull calls into question whether Britain really is a nation of animal lovers . The . pilot culls aim to ensure free-running badgers can be killed humanely, . with marksmen observed by independent experts to check they are killing . the protected animal swiftly, and post-mortem examinations carried out . to assess speed of death. 'Bovine TB is spreading at an alarming rate and causing real devastation to our beef and dairy industry. (The cull) is an important step towards taking the action we need to tackle the spread of this disease in wildlife. 'These pilot culls are just one part of our approach to control and eradicate this dreadful disease. We are using everything at our disposal to get to grips with TB including new tougher controls on moving cattle, increased herd testing and working to get effective vaccines ready as soon as possible.' The pilots will also assess whether sufficient badgers can be killed in an area to have an effect in reducing TB in cattle, following a long-term study which found culling 70 per cent of badgers in an area could reduce the disease in herds by 16%. The Government said the cull is . necessary as part of efforts to stop increasing outbreaks of TB in dairy . and beef herds, which saw 28,000 cattle slaughtered in England last . year. Without action, infection and costs would continue to soar, . officials said. Labour, which opposes the Government-sanctioned plan, have tabled an Opposition Day debate for Wednesday. Mr May said: 'It would be very rude of the Government to start a cull when there is a major debate coming up. 'Our . point is to save wild animals from abuse and there is no doubt this . cull is going to cause intense pain on a massive scale to badgers. You . cannot call it humane, which is apparently what these pilot culls are . about. 'It has become . increasingly apparent to me that, although we call ourselves a nation of . animal lovers, we treat them appallingly.' A . poll released yesterday revealed that the public is divided on the . issue of culling, with around a third (34%) opposing the policy, and . almost as many (29%) backing it. The remainder of those questioned did . not know or had no strong views on a cull. A sign has been put up on the A40 near Cheltenham ahead of the cull .

The Weather Channel said all the occupants were wearing safety belts and walked away from the banged-up vehicle. It's the first time one of the network's personalities has been injured while covering violent weather, spokeswoman Shirley Powell said. 'That was the scariest moment of my life,' Bettes said.

Tornadoes rolled in from the prairie and slammed Oklahoma City and its suburbs, trapping people in their vehicles as a storm swept down an interstate highway while commuters tried to beat it home. Five people were killed, including a mother and baby killed near Union City. Another person died at El Reno, the first city struck by the storm, said Amy Elliott, a spokeswoman for the state medical examiner. Circumstances involving the other two deaths weren't immediately known, Elliott said. About 50 people were hurt, five critically, hospital officials said. Meteorologists had warned about particularly nasty weather Friday but said the storm's fury didn't match that of a deadly twister that struck suburban Moore last week. Violent weather also moved through the St. Louis area, ripping part of the roof off a suburban casino. Friday's broad storm in Oklahoma hit during the evening rush hour and stuck around, causing havoc on Interstate 40, a major artery connecting suburbs east and west of the city, and dropping so much rain on the area that streets were flooded to a depth of 4 feet.","Brandon Sullivan and Brett Wright .

We all know looks are important in some jobs – but piloting a punt past the colleges of Cambridge isn’t the first that springs to mind. So student Ben Cronin, 20, was shocked to be turned down for work with a punt hire firm because he was not good looking enough. The first-year psychology student said being rejected was humiliating. Ben Cronin, a 20-year-old psychology student, was left shocked after a punt tout told him he was not attractive enough to work in the river punting industry . The first-year student claims when he asked about employment opportunities, the punt chauffeur branded him 'not good-looking enough' for the role . ‘I was with a group of university . friends when two of us decided to enquire after punting jobs,’ he said. ‘A friend and I approached a sales guy standing on the bridge. ‘He looked us up and down and replied in a bolshy manner, saying: “Sorry mate, you have to be good looking to do this job”.’ Mr Cronin, a student at Anglia Ruskin . University, had been punting four times before. He said that after the . man’s remarks, he and his friends abandoned their plan to rent one of . the traditional boats that afternoon. Mr Cronin, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, said: ‘It felt like it was directed at me. It was so embarrassing, I just wanted to leave. Mr Cronin from Lowestoft, Suffolk yesterday said he was already self-conscious about the way he looks but to hear he was unattractive from a stranger was very upsetting . ‘All my friends were so shocked. The way he spoke to my friend and I has put us off wanting to punt on the river ever again. ‘It has made us feel really . unconfident about how we look. I have low self-esteem issues anyway so . to hear that from a stranger was even worse than hearing it from a . friend.’ Mr Cronin made a complaint to punting . company Scudamore’s, the largest operating on the River Cam. The firm . said it had launched an investigation, but did not recognise the . description of the staff member. General manager Rob Ingersent said: . ‘The alleged comment is not something we endorse, as we recruit purely . on the basis of work criteria and individual merit.’ At peak times there are more than 200 . punts on the River Cam, each carrying up to 12 people. A chauffeured . one-hour tour costs £16 per person. Mr Cronin had been punting four times before and had been keen to secure a job with a company for the next academic year . Mr Cronin quickly made a complaint to bosses at the Scudamore's punting company and an investigation was launched into the cruel remarks. But the firm said they do not recognise the description of the man as a member of their staff . The flat-bottomed boats, steered with a 10ft pole, were developed in the middle ages for use in very  shallow water. They were introduced to Cambridge as pleasure craft a century ago, with F Scudamore opening his punt hire business in 1910. Ben described the venomous puntsman as being tall, dark-haired and 'built for the female population.' Rob Ingersent, general manager of Scudamore's said: 'The alleged comment is not something we endorse, as we recruit purely on the basis of work criteria and individual merit.'","Ben Cronin, 20, said he was insulted by a punt representative in Cambridge .

Billionaire: Strolling through central London last month, Hans Rausing appeared to be responding well to his drug treatment programme . Billionaire Hans Rausing, wearing his late wife Eva's engagement and wedding rings around his neck on a cord, has made a rare public appearance a year after she was found dead in their £50million London mansion. Last year a judge cited him as a tragic warning of the ‘utterly destructive’ effects of drug abuse, after he admitted hiding his crack addict wife’s . body for two months while he carried out a desperate charade to convince . their servants she was alive. Rausing, 49, cut a pathetic figure as he stood in the dock but strolling through central London, the Tetra Pak heir appeared to be responding well to his drug treatment programme which was imposed by the court. Sporting a new bushy beard, he wore a black leather jacket, striped polo shirt and Fidel Castro style hat as he walked with the aid of a walking stick close to the private clinic where he is being helped to end his addiction. It appeared an improvement from the last pictures of him in public with his wife, when he looked gaunt and confused as he stumbled through London close to the couple’s £70million mansion. Days after those images were taken in May 2012, Rausing’s wife Eva died at the 50-room property in Cadogan Place, Belgravia. But rather than inform police, Rausing banned staff from entering the couple’s squalid ‘crack den’ bedroom in their otherwise-immaculate home. He said she was suffering a fever and he was taking her temperature three times a day. In fact he was covering her rotting body with 12 layers of clothes, blankets and plastic sealed with industrial tape before covering it in deodorant to mask the smell. Rausing hid her body for more than two months before he was stopped by police after driving erratically through morning rush hour traffic in Wandsworth, south London. Close up: Hans Rausing looks to have his late wife's wedding and engagement rings around his neck on a cord . Then: The photograph appears to show Rausing is responding well to his treatment programme and contrasts with his gaunt appearance in early May 2012, days before the death of his 48-year-old American wife . Police who searched his car found a crack pipe, cannabis and white powder in the footwell of his Bristol Coupe and noticed his pupils were dilated. When they later raided his house, 48-year-old Mrs Rausing was so badly decomposed that she had to be identified from a fingerprint and the serial number on her heart pacemaker. Rausing received a ten month suspended sentence on the condition that he agreed to a drug rehabilitation programme at a private clinic after he admitted the common law offence of failing to prevent his wife’s lawful and decent burial. Isleworth Crown Court was told that the couple had struggled with drug abuse in their youth but had successfully fought it to form a ‘loving’ family. Younger years: Isleworth Crown Court was told that Eva and Hans Rausing had struggled with drug abuse in their youth but had successfully fought it to form a 'loving' family . But their fateful decision to raise a glass of champagne together to toast the new millennium on December 31 1999 sent them spiralling back into a devastating addiction that was to cost them everything. Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson told Rausing as he sentenced him: ‘If ever there was an illustration of the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families, it is to be found in the facts of this case. ‘You and your wife had every material advantage imaginable, and for a time a happy family life. Your relapse into the misuse of drugs, together with that of your wife, destroyed all that.’ Mr Rausing’s wealth comes from the world’s largest food packaging firm, Tetra Pak, which was founded in Sweden by his grandfather. Like several other members of the family, Mr Rausing settled in London.","Hans Rausing pictured close to private clinic where he is being helped .

A Connecticut man who posed nude for Playgirl 18 years ago, is suing his recent employer for harassment after co-workers taunted him about having posed for the magazine. Daniel Sawka's former co-workers yelled 'Timber!' around the office after they found pictures online from a 1992 Playgirl photo shoot featuring him posing as naked lumberjack. Sawka filed a lawsuit in Federal Court claiming his co-workers endlessly taunted him in the workplace and used company computers to search for the Playgirl photos. Daniel Sawka ( seen here in a current headshot), a former Playgirl model, is suing his employer because co-workers taunted him in the office once they discovered pictures of him posing as a nude lumberjack . Sawka was hired to work for ADP Inc., a payroll company, as a district sales manager in 2009. In his suit Sawka claims the harassment started a month after he was hired, when his co-workers found the nude photos online by Googling his name. 'Following the discovery of the nude pictures, employees in the office . engaged in a pattern and practice of jokes, sexually charged comments . and ridicule concerning the plaintiff and the pictures,' states the suit, as cited by Courthouse News Service. The Playgirl shoot shows Sawka posing suggestively with an axe, as well as has several pictures featuring his fully nude form. The suit goes on to say that despite Sawka's repeated requests for his co-workers to stop making comments and jokes about the photo shoot, their ridicule continued. 'Jokes . and comments were made by the defendant's employees including but not . limited to comments about plaintiff's body parts, including his . genitals, and a comment about what homosexual men viewing the photos and . what they would be doing while viewing the photos,' the complaint states.

There was sunshine, blue skies and brief showers today as the nation prepared to enjoy a bank holiday hotter than parts of Italy and the south of France. Forecasters are predicting that Bank Holiday Monday will be the hottest day of the year so far with temperatures expected to creep above 22-23C (73F) in some places, beating temperatures in the sunny European destinations. The warm weather is likely to continue tomorrow with highs of 20C (68F). The day will start cloudy, but brighten up in the south and be cooler in the north. Sunrise: Temperatures in Britain will top those in parts of Italy and the south of France on bank holiday Monday, according to forecasters . Today in the south east it began with bright blue skies with the top temperature In St James' Park, London at 17.2C (63F). The best of the weather was in Donna Nook, Lincolnshire, with 17.8C (64F). On the coast, the chilly sea temperature kept bathers and sun worshippers away, particularly in Brighton where the beach was almost deserted. The . warmest day of the year so far was on April 25 when temperatures . climbed to 23C (73F), and forecasters believe Monday may break that . record, or at the very least match it. Balmy: The River Thames was bathed in glorious sunshine this morning as Britain prepares to bask in the warmest day of the year on Monday . Sunny outlook: The temperature could soar above 23C on bank holiday Monday, forecasters say . Paul Mott, a meteorologist at MeteoGroup, said that while the temperatures over central and eastern England are expected to be in the low twenties, it might just climb above 23C in London and East Anglia. 'There's a chance it could be the warmest day of the year so far. Temperatures will be higher than quite a bit of Italy,' Mr Mott said. Sunshine: This photograph shows blue skies over the River Thames this morning, as Britain looks forward to a beautiful bank holiday weekend . 'Northern parts of Italy and south east France will be about 20C,' he added. This year's expected sunny Bank Holiday will be a big improvement from last year, which saw rain and a temperature high of 16C (60.8F) at Exeter Airport. Mr Mott said the capital and East Anglia can expect the best weather Britain has to offer this weekend - with some mixed conditions elsewhere. The outlook in Scotland is less promising, according to Mr Mott, who said: 'Scotland and Northern Ireland will have more cloud and rain as well, particularly in the west of Scotland.' Flower power: Toddler Aaron Budd, aged one, with his mother in the sunshine during a visit today at the National Trust gardens at Hinton Ampner, near Winchester, Hampshire . Flower paradise: Bathed in sunshine, Kathryn Carty marvels at the colourful rhododendron and azaleas that are finally finally blooming - five weeks later than usual - at Lea Gardens, near Matlock Derbyshire . But elsewhere people can look forward to ideal bank holiday weather, with Monday expected to be the warmest day over the three-day weekend. 'Eastern areas of England will be good on Sunday with lengthy periods of sunshine,' Mr Mott said. The warm weather is expected to see a surge in demand for barbecues, with Asda reporting a sales increase of 142% while Marks and Spencer report sales of its barbecue range 'The Grill' are expected to double on last year. Meanwhile Superdrug has reported an increased demand for beauty products such as false toe nails, wax strips and fake tan. Heat: A photographer captured the glorious sunrise over Parliament Green in London this morning, where temperatures are expected to top 68F on Monday . Forecasters said it was expected to be cloudy and damp across Scotland and Northern Ireland with outbreaks of light rain or drizzle on Monday. But the weather will be dry and generally fine across England and Wales, with warm, sunny spells, MeteoGroup said. While the news is good for sun worshippers, hay fever sufferers may struggle this weekend with high levels of pollen expected across England. The pollen count will increase as temperatures heat up, with the worst conditions expected on Sunday and Monday, forecasters said. The Met Office said tree pollen would be more significant than grass pollen until the middle of May. No takers: The deserted deck chairs on Brighton beach tell the story of the weather with little chance of any ice creams being sold . Blustery start: Brighton Beach was relatively deserted this morning, but it could be packed on bank holiday Monday if the sunshine shows up as expected . Getting warmer: It was a dull start to the day in Southsea, Portsmouth, as Zizi Tsang-Warmington walked her dogs Missie and Muttley along the beach - but forecasters say it will get brighter over the weekend . Promising outlook: Walkers wore jackets as they strolled along the beach in Portsmouth this morning, but forecasters have predicted better weather to come . People in the south east will be particularly badly affected while cooler temperatures in Scotland should lead to lower levels of tree pollen, spokesman Alexander Burkill said. He said the tree pollen count will be high towards the end of the weekend, adding: 'Today we've got a fair bit of cloud and the rain coming down, so it's going to go down to moderate. 'Onto Sunday and Monday in places, especially across England and especially in the south east, you're looking that it could get up to high.' South west England and Wales will only experience moderate levels of tree pollen on Monday, though Mr Burkill said those areas may see high levels on Sunday. Slow start: It was deserted this morning, but this ice cream kiosk is likely to see a rush as the weather gets warmer over the weekend . Regions with higher temperatures . towards the south east of England will be worse for hay fever sufferers . as warm weather leads to higher levels of both tree and grass pollen. Grass pollen will still have an effect this weekend, according to Meteogroup, the weather division of the Press Association. Tom . Tobler, of MeteoGroup, said: 'As we get more sunshine on Monday and it . warms up in southern England, it could start edging into moderate pollen . counts.' Mr Burkill . said the much-anticipated warm weather would increase pollen levels. He . said: 'It's the fact that it's going to be mostly dry, quite warm and . generally lightish winds across much of England and Wales.' Standstill: Hundreds of drivers trapped in their vehicles on the M25 Motorway in Waltham Abbey, Essex following a spillage of chemicals between junctions 26 and Junction 27 . Meanwhile, on the M25, thousands of drivers were stuck in long tailbacks today after a chemical spillage brought bank holiday getaway traffic to a halt. Essex Police arrested a lorry driver after the spillage, which saw a section of the key route between junctions 25 and 27 closed off from 5am this morning as emergency services worked to clear up the mess.","Bank holiday Monday will be the hottest day of the year, forecasters say .

The girl, who was  brandishing  two knives and threatening to harm herself, was one of more than 20 children shot by officers using the electric stun guns, figures show. Police said the Taser was used to  detain the girl and ‘prevent serious harm to both her, the public and the officers’ after she began behaving ‘aggressively’ in St Helens, Merseyside, in July 2011. Shocked: Around 24 young children have been hit with a 50,000-volt police Taser in the last three years - the youngest being just 12-years-old . Although the girl was unhurt in the . incident there are fears that being hit with a Taser can increase the . risk of  fatal heart attacks. The schoolgirl was one of  more than . 20 children stunned with the weapons in the past three years,  according . to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. They included six children aged 14, four aged 15 and 13 aged 16. Scores of other children, some as young as 11, have been threatened with the weapons. 'Safety measures': At least 194 children aged 16 or under have had Tasers deployed on them to some degree in the last three years (posed by models) In total, at least 194 children aged . 16 or under have had Tasers used on them in the past three years, . according to figures uncovered by the investigative agency OpenWorld . News. Of these, at least 24 were actually . shot by the Taser – a barb attached by a wire to deliver an electric . shock of up to 50,000 volts. These details taken from police records explian the reasons why Tasers have been used on young people. A . 12-year-girl was shot in St Helens by Merseyside Police after she was . said to have armed her herself with two knives and threatening to harm . herself. Two 11-year-old boys armed with knives in Crewe were targeted by red laser dots from a Taser. A 14-year-old girl in Nottingham was accidentally shot as officers tried to arrest a suspect in the city. A 14-year-old burglary suspect armed with a screwdriver was shot in Gwent, south Wales. A 14-year-old was shot with Taser in Northumbria after the teen attacked another person with cosh - a truncheon-like weapon. A . 14-year-old was shot by armed officers in Warwickshire who was alleged . to have been armed with a knife and 'being racially abusive'. A 14-year-old boy was drive-stunned in York for resisting arrest. A 12-year-old girl armed with a knife was red-dotted in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, by armed officers. A 15-year-old was shot in Frome, Somerset, after an alleged assault. A 15-year-old was Tasered in Nottinghamshire after apparently being violent towards an officer and carrying a knuckle duster. Last night young people’s charities . and human rights organisations said the use of Tasers on children was . deeply worrying. The high-powered weapons should be fired on children . only as a last resort, they said. Amnesty International’s Oliver . Sprague said: ‘In the United States more than 500 people have died after . being shocked by a Taser and, in many instances, the coroner declared . the Tasers a contributory factor.’ Tasers are increasingly being carried . by British police after being introduced in 2004. Many officers on the . beat can now carry the weapons after just a short training course. At least six children were ‘drive-stunned’ by Tasers – where the electric device is held directly against the body. Another 97 children were ‘red . dotted’, with officers pointing the Taser at the child and pinpointing . exactly where the barbs would hit their body with a red ‘sniper’ dot. This included a 15-year-old targeted . by Devon and Cornwall Police after he threw a glass at shop staff and . took up a ‘fighting stance’ with his eyes ‘squinted’ as officers . approached. The use of the stun weapons against . young children comes despite advice to the Home Office that Tasers are . more likely to cause heart problems in children. The advice, from independent . scientific body Defence Sub-committee on the Medical Implications of . Less-Lethal Weapons, was published in the Association of Chief Police . Officers’ Taser guidelines. It notes ‘children and adults of . smaller stature as being at potentially greater risk from the cardiac . effects of Taser currents than normal adults of average or larger . stature’. Penelope Gibbs, chairman of the . Standing Committee for Youth Justice, a coalition of more than 25 . voluntary bodies campaigning for youth justice reform, said the findings . were ‘really shocking’. ‘The number of incidents indicate . that the police are not using other techniques to calm potentially . vulnerable or disturbed teenagers,’ she said. A total of 27 forces provided . responses on the use of Tasers against children during 2010, 2011 and . 2012. But the true figure of Taser use on young children is likely to be . much higher.","A schoolgirl, 12, is one of 24 young children to be hit with a full 50,000-volt .

Police investigating allegations against the Ribble Valley MP have asked for a formal statement from the 22-year-old former parliamentary intern, who claims Evans groped his bottom for around a minute in the Sports and Social Club bar in December 2011. The man, who is now working outside of Parliament, said he had never spoken to Evans and that he was in the bar with his parents when the alleged incident occurred. 'Incredulity': Deputy Speaker and Ribble Valley MP Nigel Evans is understood to be facing a fourth sexual assault claim . He said he stopped at the bar for a drink with his parents after showing them around parliament, according to a report in the Guardian. While there, Evans stood with his back to the former parliamentary intern and groped him for around 60 seconds, the man claims. A spokesman for the Deputy Speaker told the Guardian he was unaware of the complaint and 'vigorously denies' any wrongdoing. His office is yet to respond to the MailOnline's request for comment. The allegation comes after Evans was arrested on May 4 over claims he raped one man and sexually assaulted another between 2009 and 2013. The 55-year-old Conservative politician has branded the accusations 'completely false'. Allegations: The former parliamentary intern, 22, claims he was assaulted by the deputy speaker in the Sports and Social Club bar at the House of Commons . Denying the allegations in a statement read outside his home after he was released on bail, Evans told of his 'incredulity' at being arrested over claims made by two men he had until then 'regarded as friends'. A third alleged victim then gave a statement to Lancashire Constabulary. On May 20 Evans' parliamentary offices were searched by detectives who were granted a warrant by a judge at Preston Crown Court. Officers seized 'parliamentary . material' from the deputy speaker's offices at Westminster during the . search, which was carried out with the knowledge of Speaker John Bercow. Mr Bercow said in a statement to MPs that the warrant related to 'the investigation of a serious arrestable offence'. Evans has been relieved of his duties chairing Commons debates until the police inquiries have concluded. A Lancashire Police spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'It is an ongoing police investigation and we won't be providing any further comment.'

Immigrants will be banned from claiming benefits in Britain until they have been here for six months, under plans being developed by Iain Duncan Smith. The Work and Pensions Secretary wants to make the current welfare rules even tougher – even though the Government is being taken to court by the European Commission over its existing restrictions. Brussels claims that the ‘right to residency’ test on new arrivals from the EU, designed to prevent welfare tourists claiming benefits on arrival, are discriminatory. However, officials from the Department for Work and Pensions have told the Daily Mail that Mr Duncan Smith will defy the EC and make the system even stricter. Officials from the Department for Work and Pensions have told the Daily Mail that Mr Duncan Smith will defy the EC and make the system even stricter . Mr Duncan Smith said he wants to ensure that no one who spends less than six months in Britain can access welfare, in a bid to prevent taxpayers’ money being ‘squandered’. Immigrants will be grilled about how long they have been in Britain – and asked to explain how they have spent their time – if they want hand-outs. The ‘six-month’ system will be drawn up after the DWP implements current plans to demand more evidence of residency rights from EU migrants before they can claim benefits. The changes, which will be interpreted as a declaration of war against the European Commission, will mean new migrants will be asked to go even further to prove that they have a permanent address. Would-be claimants will have to provide details of their mortgage or the length of their rental lease in order to secure eligibility. In a speech, David Cameron said Europeans would have to be 'genuinely seeking employment' in order to claim jobless benefits for more than six months . Mr Duncan Smith ordered for these plans to be fast-tracked after the EC launched its legal fight at the European Court of Justice. A friend of Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Of all the people in the Cabinet, they’ve picked a fight with the wrong person.’ Mr Duncan Smith told the Mail: ‘I won’t be deterred. I will continue to press on with reforms of the measures we currently have in place, not only to enforce the “right to residency” test we have now but also to strengthen the test. I’m determined to ensure that taxpayers’ money in this country is not squandered on benefits tourism.’ A senior DWP source added: ‘After that, Iain wants to look at ways of making sure that people have been in the country for at least six months before they can claim benefits. ‘We’ll want to know what people have been doing for that six months. That’s the next step.’ A similar crackdown was floated by the Prime Minister in March. The minister's proposals have emerged as Ed Miliband prepares to unveil new Labour policies on benefits on Thursday . In a speech, David Cameron said . Europeans would have to be ‘genuinely seeking employment’ in order to . claim jobless benefits for more than six months. Mr Cameron said this . would be one of several measures to ensure people came to Britain ‘for . the right reasons’ after it became a ‘soft touch’ under Labour. Mr Duncan Smith’s decision  to pursue . more benefits restrictions will further strain tensions between the UK . and the European Union. The Government expects its current legal battle to reach its conclusion in March 2015 – two months before the next general election. The minister’s proposals  have emerged as Ed Miliband prepares to unveil new Labour policies on benefits on Thursday. The first clues about the Opposition’s moves will come today, when the left-of-centre Demos think-tank unveils its blueprint for a two-tier welfare system. Under its proposals, those who have worked and paid sufficient National Insurance contributions would receive £95 a week as a jobseeker’s allowance – a higher rate than the standard £71.70, which would be given to those who have not paid in. The think-tank’s motive is to stress the importance of contributing to the welfare system, and dilute public anger at the something-for-nothing culture. Demos says the plan could be paid for by reducing the amount spent on the Support for Mortgage Interest scheme, which currently covers the interest on up to £200,000 of loans or mortgages for homeowners who are out of work. Senior sources say the Opposition’s frontbenchers have encouraged Demos to draw up the plans, with a view to including them in Labour’s next manifesto. Labour peer and policy guru Maurice Glasman said: ‘I welcome this work from Demos and hope the Labour party looks closely at the idea. ‘There needs to be a much stronger relationship between what people put in and take out of the welfare system. ‘A two-tier system, with higher entitlements for contributors, is definitely the way to go.’","Iain Duncan Smith wants to make the current welfare rules even tougher .

MPs have been treated to expensive trips abroad and lavish days out through their membership of parliamentary special interest groups meant to bring issues of concern to the forefront of the political agenda. The system allowing MPs to set up all-party parliamentary groups (known as APPGs) has come under fire after it emerged MP Patrick Mercer created one for Fiji after allegedly being paid thousands of pounds by lobbyists. Mr Mercer even admitted in secretly recorded . conversations that APPGs can be 'utterly useless' but could still be . appealing to MPs seeking trips to exotic locations. Globe-trotters: Among the most expensive trips funded in connection with APPGs was Conservative MP for Selby and Ainsty Nigel Adams' £8,578 visit to New Orleans in October which was funded by Eggborough Power Station in North Yorkshire . Deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats Simon Hughes, pictured right with fellow LibDem Caroline Pidgeon, visited Cyprus and Turkey last year with £740 of funding by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus . The Commons register of . interests shows that 60 MPs have been on trips in connection with APPGs in . recent months. The cost of the trips amount to £175,000 which has been funded by third parties such as banks, charities and oil companies. APPGs have no . legislative power, but are an effective way of bringing together . parliamentarians with interested parties and lobbyists. They also allow campaign groups, charities, . and other non-governmental organisations active in the field to become . involved in discussions and influence politicians. But while many MPs undertake educational . visits funded by a charity, NGO or private company as part of the work . of an APPG, the 'cash-for-access' scandal has called into question . whether the system is being abused. Lord Laird has resigned the Ulster Unionist whip after referring himself to House of Lords standards watchdogs over his contact with a fake lobbying company . According to the Sunday Telegraph, Conservative MP for Tamworth Chris Pincher took a four-day trip to Azerbaijan in connection with the country's APPG. The £2,975 trip was funded by the European Azerbaijan Society. Tory MP for Harrow East Bob Blackman and Labour MP for Jarrow Stephen Hepburn appear to have joined Mr Pincher on the trip last July. The European Azerbaijan Society also funded trips for seven other MPs and spent about £1,000 for Labour MP for Slough Fiona Mactaggart to enjoy a day in a box within the royal enclosure at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in May last year. Tory MP for Beverley and Holderness and chairman of the APPG on the global legislators organisation (Globe) Graham Stuart took a six-day trip to Rio de Janeiro to chair a session of the World Summit of Legislators. The £5,025.89 trip, which included flights and hotel expenses, in June last year was funded by Globe. Tory MP for Maldon and chairman of the British Ukraine all-party parliamentary group John Whittingdale took a trip to Yalta for four days in September. The £2,520 trip was paid by the British Ukrainian Society. One of the priciest trips to be funded in connection with an APPG was Conservative MP for Selby and Ainsty Nigel Adams' £8,578 visit to New Orleans in October which was funded by Eggborough Power Station in North Yorkshire.Meanwhile Simon Hughes, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, visited Cyprus and Turkey between May and June last year with funding of £920 - £740 of which was provided by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Numerous governments have also funded MPs to visit their countries in connection with APPGs. A review into APPGs was announced by the . Commons standards committee in January following a working group set up . by Speaker John Bercow whose recommendations included the need for . 'greater transparency'. Patrick Mercer MP has quit the Tory party whip over allegations he took £4,000 from a fake lobbying company and did not declare his interest . The 'cash-for-access' controversy has reignited calls for the Government to press ahead with promised legislation both for a statutory register of lobbyists and the power for constituents to 'recall' MPs who breach the rules. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has made clear his determination to secure the register - blaming the Tories for the lack of action. Calling for cross-party talks on a register, shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett MP said: 'We have seen no action from this Tory-led Government, despite David Cameron himself warning that lobbying was the next great scandal waiting to happen.' David Prince, interim chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said it warned in January that lobbying remained a 'significant and continuing risk to ethical standards' but that a register would not solve all the problems.","60 MPs have been on trips in connection with APPGs in recent months .

Firefighters cut her free and she was taken to hospital by South East Coast Ambulance Service with the length of metal still in her arm. Riccardo Ragazzo, 39, a chef in a nearby restaurant was the first at the scene to help. He said: 'I was going home after my work in the high street when I saw the woman slip. 'First I thought she was just in pain from the fall, but then I realised she her right arm was impaled on a spike. 'She started screaming I'm going to die. She was slipping in and out of consciousness because of the pain. Ms Baker with the section of fence which firefighters cut to free her . She has since had no feeling in her hand but doctors hope it will return in time . 'She was fighting to fee her arm but I held her to stop he moving because I knew if she moved she would lose a lot of blood.' Ms Baker was due to undergo surgery to remove the spike from her arm but a sudden movement by her caused it to fall out. She has since had no feeling in her hand but doctors hope it will return in time. Ms Baker's mum, Annie Woolcock, said it could have been much worse. She said: 'She is pretty shaken up, but she knows how lucky she is that it went in her arm and not her head. 'When she was at school she knew a boy who went over his handle bars on his bike and got a metal spike through his head and died. 'She remembered that and was really shaken up. We are just really grateful it wasn't anything more serious and want to thank everyone who helped.'","Yvonne Baker, 30, was walking in Rochester High Street, Kent .

A witness at media tycoon Alexander Lebedev's trial in Moscow today claimed that the businessman he punched on a TV programme appeared to be high on drugs and had provoked him. German Sterligov, also a guest on the talk show, said that he too became upset at Sergei Polonsky and might have hit him had Lebedev not lashed out. Lebedev faces up to five years in jail if convicted of politically-motivated hooliganism in a trial his supporters fear has overtones of media censorship. Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev, pictured left arriving at a court in Moscow, is on trial for allegedly punching businessman Sergei Polonsky, pictured right, because of political hatred . Sterligov was one of the first millionaires after Communism crumbled and previously knew both Mr Lebedev and Mr Polonsky. Asked if he was surprised . construction tycoon Polonsky seemed 'high', he said: 'No - as far as I . know it was quite a typical state for Polonsky.' Questioned on what he meant by 'high', Sterligov said: 'I meant that he was under the influence of drugs.' Asked if he was a specialist in . understanding the influence of narcotics, he said: 'Sadly I had . tragedies linked to moments when people went under the influence of . drugs. 'I am not an expert - but I can understand when a person is on drugs.' Lebedev owns a Russian investigative . newspaper and later bought the Independent titles and the London Evening . Standard, before handing control of his UK interests to his son amid . fears he could be jailed. His supporters suspect powerful . enemies are using his attack on Polonsky to seek to have him jailed in . revenge for his anti-corruption campaigns. They point out Kremlin . leader Vladimir Putin accused him of behaving like a hooligan. The hearing went ahead today as . previously without Polonsky, who said he could not come to court because . he was in Cambodia on strict bail conditions. Bizarrely, it now appears . he is relaxing by the sea in Israel. Sterligov told the court that on the . TV show - before Lebedev threw his punch - 'there was a moment when . Polonsky got very close to me, very close and sort of reached towards me . with an offer to massage me'. He stressed: 'Had he come a bit closer it would be me answering the court today, not Lebedev.' Asked by Polonsky's lawyer if . throwing punches was the right way to resolve a dispute, Sterligov - who . several years ago gave up business for a time to live like a tsarist . peasant - said: 'The way I was brought up, I find it the most adequate . answer one man can give another man when he was offended in such way. Show: Mr Lebedev (left) lashed out at Sergei Polonsky during a Russian TV debate in 2011 . Excuse: Mr Polonsky is said to be unable to attend the trial as he is stuck in Cambodia . 'I find it a very soft way of stopping another man from not going further. 'Lebedev acted as a man that stopped in as soft as possible a manner a rude and offensive person.' On the show, there were 'moments . when Polonsky was constantly throwing his arms about - and he's got long . arms, so when he gesticulates his arms reached out almost to the faces . of people sitting next to him. 'At some point his arms were close to Lebedev's face. It was quite emotional.' Judge Andrey Bakhvalov asked the witness if he was in friendly relations with Mr Lebedev. 'No, if anything I've got a little . grudge against him - but it won't influence my testimony. I have known . Lebedev for some time.' He added: 'He is quite a calm man - it is impossible for me to imagine him starting a conflict. 'Even when me and him had a conflict, . he sent complaints to the police. This is his way, to always act within . the legal boundaries. He is a person of a system.' Backstage before the programme . started Polonsky was saying 'how long should we stand people like . Lebedev with his constant lies and tricks,' he said. 'I felt uncomfortable, I didn't like it. He was hopping around, he was interrupting people, he was running around.' He told the judge there was no political element to the TV show or the dispute. The co-presenter of the show, Pavel Selin, also claimed Polonsky 'behaved provocatively'. 'Lebedev was calm enough until a certain moment and nothing predicted such behaviour,' he said. Just before Lebedev's infamous attack . - which was seen worldwide on the web - Selin said Polonsky had told . him to 'shut up' while swinging his hand towards the media owner. Polonsky also muttered about 'wanting to punch him in the face', he said. 'I thought it was offensive,' Sterligov said. He was 'invading Lebedev's personal space'. Seconds before striking, Lebedev asked who he wanted to strike in the face, he told the court. He told the judge Lebedev did not . talk about politics - a key point because he is accused of hooliganism . based on political hatred. Today was the first time Lebedev had called witnesses. He was accompanied yesterday in court by his wife Elena Perminova, the Siberian-born model and fashion icon. Prosecution witnesses included people . who had seen the two punches on TV. One was stopped randomly as she was . getting off a bus in Moscow and asked if she would testify. The trial was adjourned until June 21 . and Mr Lebedev was permitted by the judge to travel abroad to Britain, . France and Africa. Earlier he was banned from leaving Russia.

'I love babies. If I were capable, I definitely would bring them up. But I really can't support them. I then find them good families to adopt them.' Claiming that she has done nothing wrong, Du said: 'I gave out babies to families which can't give birth. They want babies and I helped them.'

The newborn baby rescued from a sewage pipe in China has been taken from the hospital by police and its maternal grandparents, officials said today. Images of the child being rescued from the drain shocked the world amid suspicions he had been flushed down the toilet because he was unwanted. But the infant has now been returned to his family after authorities decided he became trapped because of an accident. The unnamed mother claimed she fell pregnant following a one night stand - and then the father of the baby boy abandoned her. The 22-year-old woman said she could not afford an abortion or cope with the stigma of being a single mother. Now, the man has requested a paternity test and - if the baby is his - is ready to discuss with the woman how to support the child, according to an official in the Pujiang county propaganda office. This January Du was detained for selling her babies, but she was released not long after due to her disability. According to Du, who was blinded in an accident when she was five, she got married when she was 14. 'My . parents saw me as a burden,,' she said. 'They wanted to get rid of me . as soon as possible. So when they knew someone wanted to get married . with me they couldn't wait to push me out'. However, she soon found that her husband was unable to hold down a job. 'As a normal person, he can't earn any money. On the contrary, I, a blinded person, had to support the whole family,' she said. Du gave birth to her first baby, a boy, Cheng Jin, in 1991. Then in 2000 she gave birth to her first daughter, Sun Miao. As Du's first son and daughter grew up the family were found themselves in need of money for the children's education. So Du made a choice, which was to give birth and sell her babies. In 2005, Du sold her second daughter for 2,500 Yuan (£268). In the following seven years Du sold three more babies.

Staying put: Prince Harry should carry on fighting in Afghanistan despite the attack on Camp Bastion, defence experts believe . Prince Harry should carry on fighting in Afghanistan, defence experts said today despite the royal being caught 'just 400 yards' from an fierce battle when Taliban fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades burst into Camp Bastion. Former officers warned that withdrawing Harry from his military role would be 'playing into the hands of the Taliban', granting the opposition a morale-boosting propaganda victory. Concerns have heightened over the Prince's deployment since Friday night's attack, in which two US Marines were killed and four British airmen were seriously wounded. The intense three-hour fire-fight . was followed by the killing of two British soldiers by a man wearing . Afghan police uniform in a separate incident. The soldiers, from 3rd Battalion The . Yorkshire Regiment, were killed at a checkpoint in the south of Nahr-e . Saraj district in Helmand province. Harry, an Army captain, is based at Camp Bastion for his second tour of duty, due to last four months. US officials said the attack on Camp . Bastion was by heavily-armed insurgents and involved a range of . weaponry, including mortars, rockets or rocket-propelled grenades, as . well as small arms fire. The Taliban said it carried out the . attack because Harry was on the base, and also as revenge for an . internet video that mocks the Prophet Muhammad. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi . said: 'We attacked that base because Prince Harry was also on it and so . they can know our anger.' He added: 'Thousands more suicide attackers are ready to give up their lives for the sake of the Prophet.' Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, a former . commander of British troops in Bosnia, dismissed suggestions that Harry . should be withdrawn because of the attack. 'To hell with them,' he said. 'Harry wants to go there and our soldiers want him there. He should stay.' Scroll down for video . Under fire: Prince Harry was rushed to safety by a protection squad when Camp Bastion was attacked by the Taliban . The watchtower gives armed forces a panoramic view of the lands surrounding Camp Bastion . But Col Stewart stressed that the security considerations regarding the deployment of the Prince were flexible. 'These things aren't set in concrete,' he said. 'If circumstances really change then we'll make different judgments.' Col Steward added: 'Capturing, killing or hurting Prince Harry would be a huge propaganda coup for the Taliban.' Major Charles Heyman, a former . infantry officer and editor of The Armed Forces of the United Kingdom . publication, warned against the dangers of 'playing into the hands of . the Taliban'. He said: 'On balance it is a difficult equation but I think he should be kept there. 'If we take him away the Taliban will crow that they have just scored a major victory. Target: Harry is based at Camp Bastion for his second tour of duty, due to last four months . 'The second point is it would affect . the morale of the troops on the ground if Prince Harry was taken out . just because there was a threat.' Maj Heyman added that it was not the first time Camp Bastion had been targeted. 'The Taliban have been doing these . things for five years now,' he said. 'Bastion is a huge complex. It is . really a military city. 'This is one of those pinprick attacks that went right as they killed two US Marines. But in most of them no one gets hurt.' A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: . 'The threat to all our service personnel is continually assessed and . all measures taken to mitigate it. 'As we stated last week, the . deployment of Captain Wales has been long planned and the threat to him . and others around him thoroughly assessed. 'We stated that any risk posed by his . deployment, based on the capability, opportunity and intent of the . insurgency, is continually reviewed.' The Prince last night told his commanding officers he was 'staying put'. He insisted to superiors that he was ‘fine’ and was determined to carry out his duties as an Apache helicopter pilot. Military . sources told The Mail on Sunday the attack must have been planned days, . if not weeks in advance in order to gain access to the heavily fortifed . base and get to ‘within 400 yards’ of Harry. The . insurgents are believed to have studied Camp Bastion beforehand and . passed unnoticed through vehicle checkpoints before recovering a cache . of weapons hidden in the desert. At about 10pm local time on Friday, 16 . fighters dug beneath a perimeter fence on the camp’s eastern side and . ran towards the airfield, where they were challenged by US Marines. They . fired rocket-propelled grenades and rifles, killing the two Marines and . destroying aircraft including Harrier jets and Cobra helicopters. At . this stage 50 UK and US personnel, including airmen from the RAF . Regiment’s Force Protection Wing, were scrambled to the airfield. The . gun battle continued for three hours with the Taliban desperate to . reach Harry’s accommodation and a British airstrip where his Apache . helicopter was standing idle. The Prince was rushed to safety as the . Taliban closed in. The attacks on Camp Bastion reminded the world of the dangerous environment Prince Harry will be operating in . Prince Harry climbs up to examine the cockpit of an Apache helicopter with a member of his squadron at Camp Bastion near to where the attack happened . According . to Nato coalition chiefs, 15 Taliban were shot dead. The remaining . insurgent was wounded and taken to hospital at Camp Bastion where he . remains under armed guard. Last night he was at the centre of a . probe into how the enemy breached such tight security and came so close . to attacking Harry just a week into his deployment. The four British . casualties were also treated for gunshot wounds. A military source said: ‘This was a very well planned and executed attack. The logistics involved in order to get inside a base with heavy weapons takes a lot of working out. So this is not something they just dreamed up in the space of a few hours. ‘From our point of view we do not know . they are enemy until they take hostile action. They knew that and took . precautions, reaching the fence surrounding Camp Bastion with their . weapons concealed. ‘The . investigation into the attack will look at whether the insurgents . belonged to the Afghan National Army. But if they were ANA they would . probably have chosen a different method of entry to Camp Bastion. ‘When the attack began Harry was with the other Apache crew members. He was not training, this was during his down-time. ‘He . was accompanied by protection officers. Harry was carrying a loaded . weapon, so was every member of personnel at Camp Bastion. This is a new . security procedure adopted earlier this year. A number of incidents led . us to raise the security profile. Pilot: Harry is trained to fly Apache helicopters, some of the most deadly aircraft in Afghanistan . ‘He was not in danger and he resumed his training on Saturday as planned. He is fine and will not be going anywhere. ‘All the US aircraft were aligned along the eastern side of the runway, in the area where the Taliban force chose to enter the base. Many of these were destroyed in the attack, including transport and attack helicopters. The gunmen then moved towards the hangars and passenger handling areas on the western side of the runway. ‘The British aircraft and helicopters . are stored on a separate flight line with its own perimeter. Here the . enemy were intercepted by RAF Regiment personnel. They killed plenty of . the gunmen but casualties were sustained.’ Harry . met with colleagues from 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army  Air Corps after . the engagement. He is expected to conduct his first operational . missions as an Apache pilot this week. The mood at Camp Bastion was said to . be ‘doubly sombre’ last night in the aftermath of the attack on the base . and the latest British fatality of the campaign. A soldier from 1st Battalion, the Grenadier Guards, was killed on Friday by a roadside bomb in Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand. Base: Camp Bastion is the British headquarters in Helmand province (file photo) Assault: The attack on the base, pictured, was described as 'sustained' and 'complex' by U.S. officials . Harry is due to remain at Camp Bastion until January. The base is located in a remote desert area north-west of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand. It is the hub for all British operations in the province and, along with Camp Leatherneck, houses thousands of combat troops and Marines, including Danish and Estonian forces. Afghanistan’s southern region has been a hotbed of the insurgency and attacks against foreign forces happen daily. Helmand remains an active battlefield between insurgents and Nato forces and for years has been the site of some of the war’s bloodiest engagements. Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, a former commander of British troops in Bosnia, said he did not think the Prince should be pulled out of Afghanistan because of the attack. ‘To hell with them,’ he said. ‘Harry wants to go there and our soldiers want him there. He should stay.’ The Ministry of Defence insisted Harry was never in danger and claimed the attack was thwarted 1,000 yards from his accommodation. The MoD said: ‘The threat to all our service personnel is continually assessed and all measures taken to mitigate it. ‘As we stated last week, the deployment of Captain Wales has been long planned and the threat to him and others around him thoroughly assessed.’ Meanwhile, the Afghan government has indefinitely blocked YouTube to prevent its citizens seeing a clip of the controversial US-made film, Innocence Of Muslims.

The jobless rate in the single currency bloc hit 12.2 per cent, far higher than in Britain and the US, statistics agency Eurostat said. Youth unemployment surged to a devastating 24.4 per cent – meaning one in four Europeans under the age of 25 who want work cannot find a job. The jobless rate among young Greeks reached 62.5 per cent while 56.4 per cent of young Spaniards and 40.5 per cent of young Italians are out of work. Anatoli Annenkov, senior European economist at French bank Societe Generale, said the worst-hit countries are at risk of a ‘lost generation’ who will never find work. It is feared that rocketing unemployment – particularly among the young – will fuel resentment against the euro and trigger a break-up of the single currency bloc. The European Commission warned this week that unemployment across the region is ‘unacceptably high’ and threatens ‘grave social consequences’. French president Francois Hollande said it could lead to the breakdown of Europe. ‘Citizens are turning their backs on Europe and the construction of the European project,’ he said.

The payouts included £2,200 for the dead . parrot and nearly £300 to two therapy groups, disturbed by the roar of . fighter planes flying overhead. nother £900 was claimed for damage to a child’s trampoline in Lancashire. Last night taxpayers’ watchdogs blasted the huge bill. Robert Oxley, of Taxpayer Scotland, said: 'There is a danger that the MoD gets used to paying out compensation for these flights regardless of whether it is justified or not. 'Some payouts appear to be seriously stretching the boundaries of what is reasonable.' The highest amounts claimed for compensation were for personal injury. But huge sums were also paid out for damage to livestock, buildings and crops. In the last year, a helicopter injured cattle and broke a fence in Dumfries and Galloway, leading to a £5,800 claim. Meanwhile a Tornado aircraft flying over Midlothian caused personal injury and sparked another claim, this time for £4,000. Defence chiefs have also paid out . thousands to farmers who claimed the roar from low-flying jets had an . impact on their chickens’ egg-laying abilities. Mr Oxley said: 'Defence chiefs need . to do more to ensure incidents that lead to pay-outs are minimised while . ensuring pilots still get vital low altitude experience they will need . in combat zones. A Hercules aircraft flew over the Ayrshire home, leaving the MoD with a £2,000 bill (Stock image) 'The status quo is doing no one any favours and cannot be considered a solution in the long run.' The parrot death follows a similar incident in which a low-flying plane caused a startled parrot to fall off its perch and break both legs. Its owner sued the MoD and received compensation to cover vets bills including the cost of two splints. A spokesman for the MoD said an aircraft was 'low-flying' if it was less than 2,000ft above ground, 500ft in the case of helicopters. Most low-flying aircraft in the UK are training for operations in war zones, he said. Compensation payments included claimants’ legal fees and NHS charges in personal injury claims. He responded: 'The MoD will authorise . the payment of reasonable ex-gratia compensation where a link can be . established between MoD military low flying activity and any subsequent . loss or injury sustained by a claimant. A Tornado aircraft flying over Midlothian caused personal injury and sparked another claim, this time for £4,000 (Stock image) 'We are very aware of the risks of military flying, and the safety of those on the ground, as well as our aircrew, is one of our highest priorities.' Ruth Clowes, a spokesman for the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) said practitioners running therapy sessions had to make sure clients received a 'good quality of care' under its rules. And farmers have claimed more than £1million for injury or loss of livestock. Jets and copters flying at low altitudes have caused death and injury among cattle, lambs, horses and dogs in the past three years. Some cows have been spooked so badly, they stopped producing milk and chickens have quit laying eggs. Stampeding cows have burst into gardens - putting the public at risk and racking up repair bills of thousands. Tim Price, a spokesman for rural insurer NFU Mutual, said: 'We regularly deal with claims from farmers whose livestock have been spooked by planes. 'It causes deaths and injuries to livestock, there’s a risk to farmers and members of the public who could themselves be injured by stampeding animals.'","Military chiefs paid more than £2,000 after the exotic bird died .

When most Britons think of their favourite buildings in London, it's likely that the Houses of Parliament, Whitehall or Buckingham Palace may well come up. But a new exhibition is highlighting the beauty of some of the capital's lesser known and unexpected treasures, such as the graceful arches hidden inside Stockwell bus garage. The free Lesser Known Architecture exhibition celebrates the city's extraordinary architecture, which many Londoners may have seen on their daily commutes, but never really noticed before. Secret city: Stockwell Bus Garage, which boasted the largest unsupported area under one roof in Europe when it was constructed in 1952, features in the Lesser Known Architecture exhibition . Leading architecture critics nominated ten buildings, structures and subways they believe are all too often overlooked and forgotten. Curated by Elias Redstone, the exhibition at the Design Museum presents an alternative architectural map of the city. Instead of palaces and stately homes, the show focuses on bus stations and housing estates. Each site has been photographed by Theo Simpson and his images will be displayed as a series of single colour offset prints in the Design Museum Café and Tank. While many people will have heard of Highgate Cemetery, a lesser known graveyard has made the lesser known architecture list. Nunhead Cemetery is one of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries in London but is perhaps the least famous and celebrated of them. Nunhead Cemetery, located in south London, was . consecrated in 1840 and opened by the London Necropolis Company as All Saints' Cemetery.  It is now a . Local Nature Reserve. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder: The Brownfield Estate in Tower Hamlets, which was built in 1965, is one of two housing blocks to feature in the show . A more surprising addition to the list is the modernist housing complex Bevin Court. The building was constructed during the post World War II period of austerity on the site of the bomb-destroyed Holford Square in Finsbury and is one of two residential estates to be nominated. The other is the Brownfield Estate, a large residential complex in Tower Hamlets which is dominated by 27-storey housing block built in 1965. Another surprising nominee is cabmen's shelters, the green garden-shed-like buildings which have been dotted around the city since 1874 so taxi drivers can buy 'good and wholesome refreshments at moderate prices'. Today there are only 13 cabmen's shelters remaining in London. The Victorian Crystal Palace Subway is another 'hidden gem' to be nominated. Built in 1865, the walkway was constructed to allow visitors to the Crystal Palace building, where large exhibitions were held, to pass from the railway station to the grounds without dirtying their fineries by crossing the muddy roads. Tradition: This is one of 13 Cabmen's Shelters left in London. The small garden-shed like structures were erected around the city in 1874 to provide affordable beverages for taxi drivers . The Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire in 1936 and the subway is . one of the last surviving remnants. Mail Rail, the Post Office's railway hidden beneath the streets of London, has also made the list. The six-and-a-half-mile-long underground track was used to transport mail between sorting offices in Whitechapel and Paddington from 3 December . 1927 until 31 May 2003. London's historical transport system appears to have dominated the list with London Underground Arcades also making an appearance. Other sites to make the top ten include the Occidental Oil Refinery, Welbeck Street Car Park and, of course, Stockwell Bus Garage. Stockwell Garage was designed by Adie, Button and Partners, with the engineer A E Beer, and was opened in 1952. Space-age: The ultra-modern looking Welbeck Street Car Park in central London has made the top ten . The garage provides 73,350 sq ft of unobstructed parking space and could originally house 200 buses. At the time of construction it was the largest unsupported area under one roof in Europe. Since 1988 the garage has been a Grade II listed building reflecting its importance in post-war architectural and engineering history. Each nominator has written an overview of their buildings historical and design credentials that will be published in the accompanying journal, Lesser Known Architecture, Vol. 1: London. The Lesser Known Architecture photographs will also be produced as limited edition prints available to purchase from the Design Museum Shop. Lesser Known Architecture is part of the London Festival of Architecture 2013.","Lesser Known Architecture exhibition is on display at the Design Museum .

Sir Mervyn King, the departing Governor of the Bank of England, has a reputation for guarding his privacy. But today he reveals how he sacrificed marriage and the prospect of a family for his career, until an unexpected phone call reunited him with his first love. In a candid interview on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Sir Mervyn admits that he fell for Barbara Melander when they were both students at Cambridge in 1970. First love: Sir Mervyn King fell for Barbara Melander in 1970 while they were students at Cambridge University . Sir Mervyn tells Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young that his ambitions made his personal life suffer . However, after she returned to her home in Finland, they lost touch until 30 years later when she suddenly telephoned him. Barbara, an interior designer with two daughters, had been married to a Finnish businessman but divorced in 1996. Sir Mervyn says: ‘We met at Frankfurt airport and I felt exactly the same about her as I had in 1970. She moved to England and we married in 2007.’ The ceremony was in Helsinki, with just a handful of family members present, and he has maintained a veil of secrecy around the event ever since. The son of a railwayman who later became a teacher, Sir Mervyn, 65, confesses that his personal life suffered because of his determination to succeed. ‘I had relationships but never got married. I totally dedicated myself to my career. I travelled around the world for work and even in the summer I’d be off to the United States to teach. I never really had a domestic base. ‘The career always came first and that was probably a mistake. It was a sacrifice.’ He has been with the Bank of England for 22 years and tells presenter Kirsty Young: ‘Being Governor is actually one of the easiest jobs I have ever done. You are in charge but you have tremendous support.’ Critics claim that he rules with an iron fist, and he admits: ‘I demand a lot of others but no more than I demand of myself.’ Sir . Mervyn says that despite the banking crisis, he never has sleepless . nights but understands fully why people have lost faith in the banking . industry. Sir Mervyn tells the programme that his successor Mark Carney, pictured, is an 'outstanding person' ‘What has surprised me is that people haven’t got angry sooner. It is only now that you see it coming out as the impact on standards of living are being affected.’ Of the August 2007 crisis, Sir Mervyn says: ‘We had believed the financial system as a whole was more resilient, we thought the risk was in the hands of people who knew how to manage it, but that was not true. Banks were very fragile.’ As for his successor, Mark Carney, he says: ‘He is an outstanding person and he must do the job his own way.’ For himself, Sir Mervyn says that in retirement his wife’s wishes will come first. He adds ‘I’ve promised my wife that I will learn to dance.’ Desert Island Discs is on  Radio 4 today at 11.15am.","Sir Mervyn, 65, fell for fellow Cambridge student Barbara Melander in 1970 .

BBC Director General Tony Hall has been rapped for taking a holiday just six weeks into his new job. Lord Hall is due back at his desk tomorrow according to a BBC source after reportedly going off on a break on May 24th. He had agreed to take up his £450,000 role in early March, but didn't start until April 2nd after taking another holiday. Under fire: Tony Hall took a holiday just six weeks after taking over as Director general of the BBC . The Corporation announced it had wasted £100 million on an IT system on the day he is thought to have gone away - announcing the news in a press release. Criticised: MPs described the waste of £100 million of licence fee money on a IT project as an 'outrage' Since his arrival, Mr Hall has had to deal with the continuing fallout over the Jimmy Savile scandal, the conviction of former BBC presenter Stuart Hall of sex attacks on girls aged between 9 and 17 and allegations that celebrities abused victims on BBC premises. The debacle over the failed computer archive project came barely a week after the BBC was condemned for giving 894 staff an average of £23,000 each to move to its new headquarters in Salford. Tory MP Alun Cairns told the Sun today: 'Everybody is entitled to a holiday, but I've no doubt many eyebrows will be raised at this because of the crises.' Even his own staff are furious he gets a week extra holiday than they are entitled to. David Young, an assistant news editor wrote in the in-house paper: 'It sends out a terribly divisive message if there's one rule for the DG and another for the rest of us. He gets 30 days annual leave. We get 25. Why?' MPs branded the £100 million waste of licence fee money as an ‘outrage’. The corporation suspended its chief technology officer and threatened  disciplinary action for those responsible. Mr Hall axed the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) after the corporation’s governing body admitted it would be ‘throwing good money after bad’ to finish the project, which began five years ago. Abuser: Fallout over the Jimmy Savile scandal continues at the BBC . Executives will be forced to explain the . humiliating failure before the influential Public Accounts Committee of . MPs next month, and the  National Audit Office is expected to launch a . further probe later this year. The DMI was supposed to allow BBC staff to access the entire archive from their computers, doing away with the need for audio and video tapes. It was expected to save the corporation £18million in production costs because staff could share and download material remotely instead of transporting tapes between headquarters. First the original contractor, Siemens, was dropped in 2009 after months of costly delays.Control of the project was handed to John Linwood, hired as the BBC’s chief technology officer from Yahoo! on a salary of £280,000 per year . But alarm bells continued to ring over the way the DMI was being handled, and it was the subject of a damning National Audit Office report in 2011. Astonishingly, Mr Linwood was awarded a £70,000 bonus just months after the report was published.He has been suspended by Mr Hall while the BBC conducts an investigation into the debacle.","Tory MP criticises Lord Hall who is back at his desk tomorrow after his latest break .

Chained to the wall with both arms and legs shackled tightly and just a meagre portion of bread for sustenance, you'd be forgiven for thinking that these men were incarcerated for some heinous criminal act. But these men aren't criminals, this is actually rehab Afghanistan style. The men pictured imprisoned in squalid conditions are there in a bid to cure mental illness, drug addiction, or are there because they are suspected of being possessed by evil spirits. Desperate measures: Mohammed Ali, 36, and Nabiullah Safi, 23, both drug addicts, are chained to a wall during his 40-day incarceration at the Mia Ali Baba shrine in Jalalabad, Afghanistan . Harsh treatment: Amanullah , 20, has been prescribed a strict diet of water, bread and black pepper to cure his drug addiction . It is believed that a 40-day incarceration at the Mia Ali Baba shrine in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, locked in chains and maintaining a strict diet of bread and water will rid these men of their demons. With little access to even the most basic health care for many Afghanistans due to poverty, frustrated families are turning to places like the 300-year-old shrine in a desperate bid to cure their loved ones. But the prescription is a stark one and a far cry from the facilities that westerners suffering similar ailments benefit from. With the government estimating that some 60 per cent of Afghans suffer from psychological disorders coupled with the lack of state care, it's little wonder that so many people have nowhere else to turn. Historic: The shrine keepers have been taking in the mentally ill for some 300 years. Here Nabiullah Safi, 23, a drug addict, looks forlorn in his 'cell' Rough justice: Those 'treated' at the shrine survive on just bread, water and black pepper . Among those imprisoned at the shrine are . 36-year-old Mohammed Ali and Nabiullah Safi, 23, both drug addicts who . are there to be cured. Mohammed Sadeq, 40, says he has no idea what is wrong with him, only that he has wild mood swings. He says that the children in his village would call him 'crazy man' and throw stones at him.' The men are all kept in small rooms without windows and only allowed to wash their hands and face. Stark conditions: Shafi, 38, is another drug addict. The men are only able to wash their face and hands while at the shrine and talking is prohibited . Harrowing: The men are only allowed out of their 'cell' to pray or use a proper toilet if guardians deem their health to be improving . Talking is strictly prohibited. Although the shrine is considered holy, conditions there are anything but, with the men forced to live alongside puddles of their own waste. The only time the men can go outside, go to a proper toilet or pray is if one of the keepers deems that their health is improving. The keepers of the shrine have been accepting the mentally ill here for some 300 years but naturally the shrines are frowned upon by health care professionals who say they are ineffective. On display: A village boy looks frightened as he watches Nabiullah Safi, 23, a drug addict, who is chained to a wall at the Mia Ali Baba shrine in Jalalabad . They say that they merely prey on those suffering in abject poverty who can't afford medical treatment. But the keepers say that they are merely upholding the tradition set by Ali Baba, the historic figure that the shrine is named after. He is said to have looked after the mentally ill when they were shunned by all others. One of the shrine's current guardians claims to have seen hundreds of people admitted there cured by the time they leave. Mia Subadar said: 'This is an obligation for my family but it's also an honour.'","The Mia Ali Baba shrine is thought to cure addicts and the mentally ill .

She's currently enjoying a tropical holiday on the paradise island of Tobago with her rugby hunk boyfriend, Danny Cipriani. But Kelly Brook's mood doesn't seem to be mirroring her peaceful surroundings, with the model finally retaliating at love rival Katie Price as the bitter war of words between the enemies intensifies. Labelling Katie 'desperate' and claiming the 35-year-old star has been 'threatening' her via text message, Kelly seemed to have got wind of the fact that the pregnant mother-of-three was planning on doing a 'kiss and tell' on Danny over the weekend. Standing by her man: Kelly Brook, pictured on holiday in Tobago with Danny Cipriani on Thursday, has retaliated at love rival Katie Price, labelling her 'desperate' and claiming the 35-year-old star has been 'threatening' her via text message . Branding the move 'hilarious', the 33-year-old model slammed Katie for being 'one of many' when she briefly dated Danny in October 2011. Writing on her Twitter page in a series of posts, Kelly said: '@MissKatiePrice Your doing a Kiss&Tell on Danny?? Haha that's hilarious you dated for 5mins and was one of many at that time. Desperate. '@MissKatiePrice I saw the texts you sent him threatening me. So yes I've seen the messages. Will happily call you. DM me.' War of words: Kelly seemed to have got wind of the fact that pregnant mother-of-three Katie was planning on doing a 'kiss and tell' on Danny . It's war! Katie Price, pictured in Shoreditch on . Saturday, and Kelly Brook, pictured in London last week, have reignited . their war of words . While Katie is yet to respond to the tweet, it would seem the feud between the warring pair is set to continue for a while longer. Glamour model Katie upped the spat earlier this week by warning Kelly that her boyfriend will never be faithful to her. Price, also known as Jordan, reignited her war of words with the TV presenter, 33, on Twitter on Tuesday night, claiming the rugby star is always trying to contact her, just days after Kelly mocked her recent marriage to Kieran Hayler on Celebrity Juice. No trouble in paradise here: Kelly has spent the past few days of her tropical island holiday constantly uploading pictures of her and boyfriend Danny looking more in love than ever . The 35-year-old mother-of-three lashed out at Kelly, writing: '@IAMKELLYBROOK pick up the phone if you hav a prob instead of hiding behind a tv screen to bully me! '@IAMKELLYBROOK ask danny about his emails & texes sent to me behind your back which ill show you kieran agrees he will never be faithful.' Katie's comments come after Kelly made fun of her third marriage on Celebrity Juice on Thursday, when host Keith Lemon asked the panel: 'What did Katie Price do for her husband on their wedding day?' Claws out: Kelly Brook has started to ignore Katie Price's tweets, but the glamour model has warned Danny Cipriani will 'never be faithful' to her . Kelly replied: 'Did she burn my calendar hanging on his wall?' When a fan tweeted Katie about the joke, she replied: 'I'm sure kelly wouldn't be laughing if I said the things Danny Cip said to me about her in the bedroom when I was with him hahaha (sic).' Kelly then hit back and implied that she was still in touch with Danny, when he briefly dated Katie in October 2011, despite living with then-boyfriend Thom Evans at the time. She wrote: 'No but I did laugh when he turned up at my house driving your car the next day ;) I don't think you know anything.' On Tuesday night, Katie thanked Kelly for confirming that Danny had driven her car 'without a license and insurance'. It's all kicking off: The two women started battling on Twitter after Celebrity Juice . She then teased fans that she would reveal all about her brief fling with the rugby player in her upcoming autobiography. But Brook had been ignoring Katie's last comments, instead choosing to post pictures of her holiday with Danny instead - until now. The models have been embroiled in a bitter feud since Kelly reunited with Danny in February and Katie called her a 'heffer'. She . added: 'Rumour has it she's been hanging out with our mutual ex Danny . Cipriani. Knowing him, I guess she's probably been doing a bit of . comfort eating.' Kelly and Katie seemed to have reached a ceasefire recently after weeks of trading barbs. However, the rift between the pair is well and truly back on, and seems to have reached a new level after the latest bout of tweets started last weekend. Naughty: Kelly couldn't resist another dig at Katie on her last episode of Celebrity Juice last Thursday . When someone tweeted Katie telling her she was being 'mugged off hard' by Kelly's comments, she responded: 'I'm flattered she must be obsessed with me as has to keep mentioning me.' When one Twitter user included Kelly . and Katie's handles in her message, it ended up creating an online . dialogue between the rivals. On Friday night, Katie initially refrained from replying to Kelly's comment directly, she did retweet a comment from a follower suggesting Kelly should keep quiet. The tweet, by @TysonPrice4 read: '@IAMKELLYBROOK Why don't you leave @MissKatiePrice name out of you're mouth u stupid b**ch !!!' Katie briefly dated Danny in October 2011, (during a break from ex-fiance Leandro Penna) who has since reunited with Kelly in February this year. Unimpressed: Katie retweeted an offensive comment about Kelly . Kelly and Danny originally dated from 2008 until 2010, before she went on to have a two year romance with his former Wasps teammate Thom Evans. However, Kelly returned to her ex just weeks after splitting from Thom in January 2013. The row between Katie and Kelly kicked off in February this year, when the former accused the brunette model of looking heavier after seeing photos of her shooting her New Look swimwear campaign in Miami. She wrote her column in The Sun: 'The pictures of Kelly modelling her latest New Look swimwear range in Miami don't seem to be airbrushed and I'm FLABbergasted to see how big Kelly really is. You're a heffer (sic), Kelly, but still a hot one.' She even suggested Kelly was 'comfort eating' because she was seeing her ex-boyfriend Danny again. Soon after, Kelly responded, accusing the mother-of-three of being 'rude'. Shared history: Kelly is now dating her ex-boyfriend Danny Cipriani again, who briefly dated Katie in October 2011 . She said: 'I actually wish her all the best. It's sad isn't it? I think it's a bit sad... I think girls can get away with having a bit of meat on our bones; I don’t mind a wobbly arm or a bit of cellulite.' However, a few days later, Kelly couldn't resist making a pop of Katie on Celebrity Juice, when she compared her to the character Magda from the hit movie There's Something About Mary. When asked by host Keith Lemon what she would do if Katie was there, she replied: 'What, Magda from There's Something About Mary?' Magda was the fiftysomething, sun-worshipping next door neighbour of Cameron Diaz's character Mary in the hit 1998 comedy. Fling: Katie and Danny at Thorpe Park in Surrey in October 2011 during their brief romance . Played by actress Lin Shaye, she was known for her bleached blonde hair, permatan and caked on make-up... not unlike Katie.

While the world – and especially the bookies – enjoy the traditional speculation over the sex and name of any impending royal arrival, the future third in line to the throne has already made royal and constitutional history. For he or she will be the first addition to the new-look, non-sexist line of succession which will govern the Crown for evermore. In short, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first-born will trump all subsequent siblings, even if she is a princess who is followed by a string of younger brothers. Happy couple: Kate and William's baby will be third in line to the throne and has already made royal and constitutional history . Changes: Last year, David Cameron decided that the time had come to tackle the status quo and change the rules of succession . Last year, David Cameron decided that the time had come to tackle the status quo and change the rules of succession. It was never going to be straightforward. For any change could even lead to meddling with such fundamental constitutional humdingers as the Act of Union. And that is not the only reason that Mr Cameron’s predecessors have flinched from doing anything about this. Other monarchies have already changed their succession laws. In Sweden, famously, the toddler Princess Victoria was suddenly promoted to Crown Princess ahead of her infant brother who had actually been born Crown Prince. But things have always been more complicated in Britain because the Queen is Sovereign of 15 other countries, from Canada to Tuvalu. Any change had to require simultaneous unanimity from all of them. Once William had made his marriage vows, however, it was clear that this had the potential to become a more pressing issue. So, Mr Cameron decided to act while he had the prime ministers of all 16 nations in the room at last year’s Commonwealth summit in Perth. They all signed a ‘heads of agreement’ which means that the new system is now acknowledged and already applies de facto. However, it still needs to become law (or become de iure, as lawyers like to say). Britain must legislate first so that all the other 15 parliaments can follow suit but Westminster still needs a document of ‘formal consent’ from all 15 individual governments before it can proceed. So, the pressure is now on two politicians to get on with it. One is Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime . Minister and the man in charge of the ‘political and constitutional . reform agenda’. He will be responsible for steering a new Succession . Bill through Westminster. The . other is John Key, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has been . charged with rounding up all the necessary ‘formal consents’ from the . other realms. Last night, a . Cabinet Office spokesman said that no timetable was in place but Mr . Clegg already has the necessary Bill drafted and ready for Parliament as . soon as Mr Key gives him the go-ahead. The process is still fraught with political implications. Under pressure: The Deputy Prime Minister is in charge of the 'political and constitutional reform agenda' MPs with Scottish nationalist or republican leanings may see it as a welcome opportunity to enjoy some political mischief and slap down some awkward amendments. John Key has been charged with rounding up all the necessary 'formal consents' from the other realms . Among the peerage, there will, no doubt, be many sisters and daughters of hereditary dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts and barons who feel that the time has come to amend the inherent sexism in Britain’s aristocracy. The loudest complaints, however, will come from those who point out that the British laws of succession continue to discriminate on religious grounds because the monarch is barred both from being a Roman Catholic – although the new rules will allow him or her to marry one. It is at that point that ancient legislation like the Act of Union could be examined. In the past ten years, Tory, Labour and Lib Dem MPs have all attempted to introduce Private Members’ Bills to change this aspect of the succession; the most recent was last year. It seems likely that some MPs will want, at the very least, to extract a commitment from the Government to end what they regard as all sectarianism at the heart of the British constitution. Mr Clegg has his work cut out. The Queen, as ever, will abide by the will of Parliament. Meanwhile, there are other priorities for the duke and duchess – and the unborn HRH Prince or Princess X of Cambridge.

The royal couple had both originally . been due to attend the event but all of Kate's forthcoming public engagements were cancelled so she could receive treatment for severe morning sickness. The cancellation was announced after Prince William joked the previous day that morning sickness should be renamed as Kate suffered it all day and night. Prince William is to spend this evening with the pregnant Duchess who is recuperating after spending three nights in hospital with severe morning sickness . It now appears unlikely that the Duchess will attend the premiere of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey film in the West End on Wednesday, and may not make another public appearance for several weeks. A St James's Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke of Cambridge will no . longer attend the British Military Tournament at Earl's Court this . evening, but will spend Sunday privately with the Duchess instead. 'It is well known that hyperemesis gravidarum often recurs and, until . further notice, to allow the Duchess a degree of privacy during her . pregnancy, we do not intend to offer regular condition checks or advise . of routine developments associated with it.' The cancellation of Prince William's attendance at the event, billed as 'the largest display of . military theatre in the world', comes after he last night attended a charity event. He went solo for the first . time since the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge, also 30, was discharged . from hospital. The Duke of Cambridge attends the Winter Whites Gala in aid of Centrepoint at the Royal Albert Hall in London . He attended a . glittering charity tennis gala, the Winter Whites Gala, held in aid of . homeless charity Centrepoint, at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He was due to be accompanied by the Duchess, but she is resting after suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, an acute - and potentially dangerous - form of morning sickness. The Duke, who is patron of Centrepoint, was congratulated by many on the news that a baby is on the way. Former Centrepoint chairman Michael O'Higgins said: 'He said they shouldn't call it morning sickness as it's a day and all night sickness. 'All I've seen of him is his amazing ability to relate to people and I think the care he's shown for his wife this week says a lot.' Prince William, looking smart in black tie, joined tennis greats John McEnroe, Björn Borg and Boris Becker as well as celebrities including Sam Branson and Sadie Frost at the event. The Royal Albert Hall was turned into a winter wonderland. Inside, guests were greeted by actors dressed in costumes with a Dr Zhivago theme. The Duke said it was a 'great pleasure' to be at the charity event as he later gave a speech. He told guests that some of the most inspiring moments of his life had been with the young people of Centrepoint. Referring to the night he spent on the streets in 2009 to experience what it is like sleeping rough, he said: 'Of course, this was just one night. 'I was cold but safe, and I knew I had a home waiting for me. 'Many others have no such luck. The cold streets are the only reality they know. 'And yet so often their spirit shines through. 'What these unfortunate men, women and young people could achieve given the right opportunities is limitless. I really believe that.' Prince William, accompanied by Centrepoint's chief executive Seyi Obakin and trustee Danielle Alexandre, arrives at the gala . He said that afterwards, he and . Centrepoint chief executive Seyi Obakin had decided to set a goal to . eradicate homelessness in the next 10 years.

Ex-school friend Jessica Hay claimed the Royal couple discovered she was expecting at their small, three-bedroom cottage in Wales in October. She described it in an interview with Australian magazine New Idea as 'the most nerve-racking moment of Kate's entire life'. Jessica claimed the Royal couple wanted to make a public announcement about the pregnancy at Christmas, but their plan was blown when the Duchess was admitted to hospital with acute morning sickness. She also claimed the pair do not want to know the sex of the baby. The event ended with William presenting the Centrepoint Great Britain Youth Inspiration Award to Novak Djokovic. The . world number one, who is a Unicef ambassador, was recognised for his . humanitarian work to raise awareness of the importance of early . childhood education in Serbia. Tim . said: 'William seemed in good spirits. I just congratulated him on the . impending birth and obviously said I hoped she was feeling better.' The Duke laughed in disbelief as he spoke to some guests who had travelled all the way from the U.S. to attend the event. Dr Natalie Monticciolo, from Tampa, Florida, was with other charity workers from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She said: 'He joked 'which one of you has come the furthest? It was magical to meet him.

Footage has emerged of the moment the Duchess of Cambridge appeared to let slip the sex of her unborn baby – and it has done little to dampen speculation that she is expecting a girl. Despite official denials that the duchess had given the game away, the video of the blushing mother-to-be seems to validate claims that she began to say the word ‘daughter’.

Bookmaker William Hill said it was forced to suspend betting on the baby’s sex at 10pm on Tuesday as the story got out and punters rushed to put their money on the arrival of a princess. Rival Ladbrokes is still open for business – although odds on a girl have plummeted from 4/5 to 1/2, while odds of 6/4 are being offered to those who think the baby will be a boy.

It’s very, very sweet of you.’ Grimsby resident Sandra Cook, 67, then asks: ‘Did you say my daughter?’ A slightly flustered Kate initially looks confused but when she realises what Mrs Cook means, she smiles, raises an eyebrow and wags her finger saying: ‘No my, oh my?

Targeted: Prince Harry will be in the Taliban's sights when he returns to Afghanistan at the controls of an Apache attack helicopter . Taliban leaders have promised to use 'all their power' to kill or capture Prince Harry when he returns to Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot. The 27-year-old is expected to fly missions out of Camp Bastion in Helmand Province on a four-month tour of duty, according to Ministry of Defence sources. Having spent 10 weeks as an infantry officer in the war-torn country in 2008, he will go back as a co-pilot gunner on the world's most deadly attack chopper. But even with such fearsome weaponry at his disposal, the Taliban have revealed their determination to catch him dead or alive. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the insurgency, said: 'In the past, we have defended against the invaders and we will do so in the future. 'We will continue to defend against all the invaders, but we will use all our power to kill or capture the Prince.' However, he claimed that Harry would be treated like any other prisoner if caught.

With sun-kissed locks and golden skin, it is a widespread assumption that people look better in the summer months than during the great winter chill when hands are dry and noses snuffly. And one dating agency is now urging people to 'summer-proof' their online photos in order to increase their chances of finding romance. Match.com has suggested members add more summery photographs of themselves and remove the wintry ones, after their survey revealed 73 per cent of people find others more attractive during summer than winter. Looking good, Tulisa: According to the latest survey, we really do look hotter in the summer, and over half of us feel far more attractive in the warmer months . The study asked people to select the . more attractive from two images of the same person taken in winter and . summer, and almost three out of four people selected the summer photos. When asked why, the respondents said that the summer shots looked happier (72 per cent), healthier (50 per cent), and more confident (37 per cent), while 21 per cent said they thought it was because people were wearing nicer clothes and accessories. Researchers found 73 per cent of people said others were more attractive in the summer than winter, while women are more likely than men to look better in the summer month. More than half the people polled (54 per cent) said they feel more attractive in the summer, while just one in 50 (two per cent) felt they look better in the winter. Summer glow: 73 per cent of people said others were more attractive in the summer, and women - such as Lucy Mecklenburgh from TOWIE, pictured on holiday in Spain, are more likely than men to look better . Interestingly, women are more likely than men to visibly reap the physical benefits of the summer months. Some 82 per cent of those voting on the female photos indicated ladies were more attractive in the summer, compared to nearly two-thirds (65 per cent) who thought the men looked better in the warmer months. Kate Taylor, resident relationship expert at match.com, said: 'It's natural that we find others more appealing in the summer. 'Typically, both sexes look better when outdoors and relaxed rather than huddled up in hats and scarves. Plus, you're more likely to be outside enjoying the sunshine and having a good time, and this comes across as much in a photo as it does in person.' Profile update: Online dating companies are urging people to add more summery pictures to their social media pages to attract more attention . She added: 'If you are currently dating, or looking to start, now is the perfect time to show what makes you great. 'Make the most of looking happier and healthier, and use the extra confidence boost to meet even more new people. 'If you're using a dating service, make sure you have a summery photo for your profile picture, as this will make you look even more attractive in the eyes of your potential date. 'In fact, why not take the opportunity to give your whole profile a make-over and ensure you're summer-ready.'","Almost three in four people say summer photos are better .

Former Major League Baseball superstar Pete Rose, banned from the sport since 1989, has revealed he now earns more than $1million a year signing autographs in Las Vegas. Throughout his long and illustrious career Rose used to charge for his signature, but since 2005 he has been a regular fixture signing at the Mirage Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, when he now has his own memorabilia shop. Since 2005, Rose claims to have spent several hours a day, for 15 to 25 days per month, 12 months of the year signing his name for money. Baseball legend Pete Rose has revealed he earns more than $1 million a year signing autographs in Las Vegas . Rose says he is happy to sign and pose for photos with anyone, provided they buy some of the memorabilia he and his business partners sell, including baseballs and photos ranging from $75 to $800. 'I must say that what I do, and I don't mean to sound arrogant about this, but what I do, I think I'm the best at it,' he told The Wall Street Journal. After years of practice, Rose knows his market in Vegas and says he much prefer conventions and business travelers to party goers. 'Every three days, there's different people. People come here and they have money and they shop and they spend money,' he said. Pete Rose and fiance Kiana Kim had a short-lived reality show which wasn't a hit with TLC viewers earlier this year . Born in 1941, Rose was nicknamed ‘Charlie Hustle’ during his career as a player from 1963 to 1986. He also managed his hometown team, the Cincinnati Reds, from 1984 to 1989. He is the all-time Major League leader in hits (4,256), games played (3,562), at-bats (14,053) and outs (10,328). He won three World Series rings, three batting titles, one Most Valuable Player Award, two Gold Gloves, the Rookie of the Year Award, and also made 17 All-Star appearances at an unequaled five different positions. Then in August 1989, three years after he retired as an active player, Rose agreed to permanent ineligibility from baseball amidst accusations that he gambled on baseball games while playing for and managing the Reds, including claims that he bet on his own team. Rose was a massive success both as a player and coach at his hometown team the Cincinnati Reds . In 2004, after years of public denial, Rose admitted to betting on baseball and on, but not against, the Reds. He remains hopeful that one day he will be re-instated, but his election to the Hall of Fame remains a contentious one throughout baseball. While Rose's autograph signing business remains in good health, another of his ventures appears to have bitten the dust. His reality show TLC's Pete Rose: Hits & Mrs, aired in January but didn't make it to the end of it's six episode run. The show chronicled the 71-year-old's life with his fiancee, 30-something Playboy model, Kiana Kim and her two children. Since 2005, Rose has been a regular attraction at The Mirage in Las Vegas where he spends 15 to 25 days per month signing his name for money . 'We’re not a traditional family,' said Kim prior to the show launching. 'We are a total modern-day family, mixing the cultures, the ages, the different backgrounds together.' 'I didn’t even know who Pete Rose was when I first met him. It’s kind of a crazy story, but at the core of every family is love and it’s what TLC wants to show.' Rose had hoped that the show would afford him the opportunity to clear up misconceptions that he believes the public have about him. 'People will get a chance to see what kind of personality I have - and she has,' he said. '... we go through the same things everybody else . does: taking the braces off, making sure they get their education and . they go to basketball practice or acting class.' The couple appeared on Howard Stern's radio show in 2010 to discuss their active love life, while Rose's adult children have voiced their skepticism regarding the engagement.",The former Cincinnati Red spends 15-25 days each month signing and selling memorabilia in the Mirage Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip .

A happy memory of Singapore: The photo that the Duke and Duchess have sent out to wellwishers . She has barely reached the half-way stage of her pregnancy. But the Duchess of Cambridge has been so inundated with good wishes from members of the public that she and her husband, Prince William, have created a special card to thank them. In recent days the couple’s office at St James Palace has been sending out the elegant ‘thank you notes’ to members of the public who have written to them in the past few weeks. Rather than the more traditional-style . letter normally sent out by members of the Royal Family, this one is a . postcard with a picture on the front of William and Kate taken on their . official visit to Singapore last year. On the back is the message: ‘The Duke . and Duchess of Cambridge were touched by your kind words following the . wonderful news that they are expecting their first baby. 'It really was most thoughtful of you and Their Royal Highnesses send their warmest thanks and best wishes.' Inside the special card: A gracious message from expectant parents The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . The baby is most likely to have been conceived in early to mid-October, shortly after the couple returned from their tour of the South Pacific.Sources have told the Mail the Duchess was not pregnant or actively trying for a baby during the two-week trip due to the anti-malaria medication that she was taking, drugs that she would needed for a further week after returning home on September 20.She would most likely have conceived either at their homes in Anglesey or London.At the time the couple had a series of public engagements including a visit to Middle Temple Inn in London to launch a scholarship scheme in their names on October 8.The following day they visited the FA’s new training centre at St George’s Park in Staffordshire.On October 10 the Duchess was in Newcastle while her husband attended the funeral of his former nanny, Olga Powell.That evening they met for a private dinner at the LouLou club in Mayfair. The following day the prince made a solo appearance at a dinner at St James’s Palace. A personal touch: The thank you card that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have sent out to people who wrote to congratulate them . The card is not signed by Kate but the envelope in which it comes bears her distinctive ‘C’ cypher. The picture on the front was chosen personally by the couple. It shows them on the very first day of their tour of south east Asia to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee at Singapore’s Botanical Gardens. Kate was wearing an exquisite pale pink kimono-style dress. It was made especially for her by British designer Jenny Packham, and covered with tiny orchids. It was an appropriate choice since the couple were being afforded the honour of having an orchid name after them, a purple spotted ‘Vanda William Catherine’. A St James’s Palace spokesman said the cards were being sent out by the Duke and Duchess’s Correspondence team as the couple had been touched by the number of good wishes they had received. The couple’s first baby, who will be third in line to the throne, is due in July. There is much speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge may be expecting twins because of her age and the acute morning sickness that she experienced in the early stages of pregnancy. Bookmakers slashed the odds on twins from 50/1 to 8/1 after her hyperemesis gravidarum - a kind of morning sickness - in December. No mother of a future monarch has given birth to twins in Britain since the 15th century. However, under new legislation, if the Duchess of Cambridge does gives birth to a boy and a girl, it will be the first-born who succeeds – no matter their gender. The Duke and Duchess recently went for a . Caribbean holiday on the island of Mustique as a 'babymoon' break . before their baby arrives. However, the Duchess has since been back to her usual duties visiting people around Britain, and her schedule has been a busy one. Most recently she was seen this month at Hope House, a 23-bed treatment centre in Clapham, south-west London, run by Action on Addiction, a charity of which she is patron.","Wellwishers for the Duchess are being treated to thank you letters .

"By . Ben Spencer and Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 22:36 EST, 25 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:39 EST, 27 March 2013 . Sell-off: Rescue helicopter services, such as those flown by Prince William, will now be operated by a private American company . A U.S. firm was today handed the contract for Britain’s helicopter search and rescue operations. The award of the £1.6billion contract to Texas-based Bristow Group marks the end of 70 years of search and rescue operations by the Royal Navy, the RAF and the Maritime & Coastguard Agency. Armed forces pilots such as Prince William, who works at the RAF search and rescue base on Anglesey, will be replaced by civilian contractors over the next few years. The deal, which runs from 2015 to 2026, will also mean the end of the much-loved Sea King helicopter, famous for its yellow RAF or red Navy coat. As well as its emergency role, the Sea King was used in a combat capacity during the Falklands conflict. Bristow is planning to replace it with the faster Sikorsky S-92 and Somerset-built AgustaWestland 189. The Government has been trying to offload the rescue operation in a time of cost-cutting at home and extensive military operations abroad. The deal means a reduction from 12 to ten search and rescue bases, with an end to operations at RAF Boulmer in Northumberland and Portland coastguard centre in Dorset. The Government believes the ten surviving bases will be able to cover much larger areas with faster helicopters. Mercy mission: Prince William leaves a Sea King helicopter, which will be replaced as part of the plans . Bristow, the Texan firm that won the contract, will use the Sikorsky S-92 helicopter, which it already uses to transport offshore oil workers in the UK . The Sea King helicopter has been an iconic sight over British seas for nearly four decades - whether emblazoned in RAF yellow or the red of the Royal Navy. The search and rescue vehicles first entered military service in 1977 and were built by Westland Helicopters, adapted from the Sikorsky S-61. It is well adapted for search missions as it can hold up to 19 passengers as well as the crew.The Sea King's Rolls-Royce H1400-1 Gnome engines give it a top speed of 143mph. The vehicle is nearly 56ft long, with rotors of 62ft. Of the many RAF pilots to have operated the Sea King, the best-known is Prince William, who has been flying rescue missions since October 2010 - following in the footsteps of his uncle, the Duke of York. Bristow, . which has operated for more than 50 years, already provides transport . services in the UK to ferry oil-rig workers to and from North Sea . platforms. Its success is . at the expense of UK firm Bond Aviation, which was also in the running . for the contract. Trade unions have argued a commercial operator with . civilian staff will not be able to match the specialist skills of . military crew. A previous attempt to offload the service to the private sector collapsed in 2011 when Canada’s CHC Helicopter – the preferred bidder – revealed that a former Whitehall insider had given it ‘commercially sensitive information’. CHC was eliminated from the running in January after it was underbid by the other two firms. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: 'Our SAR helicopter service plays a crucial role, saving lives and providing assistance to people in distress on both land and on sea. 'With 24 years of experience providing SAR helicopter services in the UK, the public can have great confidence in Bristow and their ability to deliver a first-class service with state-of-the-art helicopters.' Officials claim that the deal will allow search and rescue helicopters to reach 85 per cent of accident hotspots within 30 minutes, up from 70 per cent currently. Bristow Helicopters was founded in Aberdeen in 1953, and was taken over in 1996 by the American firm Offshore Logistics, which subsequently rebranded itself as Bristow Group.","U.S. private firm Bristow Group will take over helicopter rescue service .

A boy, aged 6, tried to kill himself after seeing corpses on the street of his home town in war-torn Syria. The boy, from the northern province of Idlib, a rebel stronghold, was found by his brother, 12, hanging from a rope tied to a swing on the family's balcony. In a shocking portrayal of life in a country being decimated by a brutal civil war, he told his father 'he would rather die like this than to have Assad come and kill him with a bomb or gun'. Meanwhile, another six-year-old was pulled out dead from under the rubble on the outskirts of Syria's northern city of Aleppo after an airstrike by Syrian government forces at the weekend. The boy, identified by locals as Mohamed Abdou al-Ghadhban, died after shelling by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad caused buildings to collapse on top of him. A still of a video uploaded to YouTube today shows a young boy pulled out dead from the rubble after shelling by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad on the outskirts of Syria's northern city of Aleppo . Syrians search for the bodies of two girls thought to be under the rubble of a building hit during an airstrike by Syrian government forces in Aleppo on Sunday . Aleppo has become a main focus of the conflict since late July. On Sunday Syrian forces intensified air attacks on the city and shelled rebel strongholds. Warplanes on Saturday bombed the town of Azaz near Aleppo and shelling continued in several of the city's neighbourhoods, including the Salaheddin neighbourhood where much of the regime's military operations against the rebels have been focused. In Idlib, where the young boy tried to take his own life, civilians have faced daily gunfights and the sight of corpses lying in the street for hours before being retrieved. His mother spoke of the horrific event which nearly took her son's life. His mother, who didn't want any of the family to be named, told The Times: 'He is only six. He is too young for these dark thoughts. We knew he was scared but we didn't understand how much.' When his older brother discovered him on the balcony last month, he screamed to his mother. He wasn't breathing at the time and his family took him straight to a doctor. He was in a coma for several days before he woke. Human rights groups estimate that more than half of the 130,000 refugees fleeing the conflict-torn Syria are under the age of 18. Many of those that remain are in refugee camps and cramped apartments where they are waiting out until the end of the war.

A Syrian man looks out of the rubble as rescuers, not shown, look for the bodies of two girls thought to be under the rubble of a building hit by a Syrian government airstrike in Aleppo . There were reports children have also become targets in Syria, with Syrian security forces having killed, arrested and tortured children in their homes, schools or on the streets. Men, women and children are trapped in bombed-out towns, people are struggling to find food or medical supplies to treat the sick and wounded, while the grim cycle of shelling and air strikes and fighting claims scores of lives daily. The International Committee of the Red Cross began treating the conflict as a civil war more than a month ago, when the fighting dramatically escalated, reaching the capital Damascus and the main northern city of Aleppo. Yesterday it was revealed British intelligence on Syrian troop movements was helping rebels in their fight against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. The disclosure by a Syrian opposition official was the first indication of British intelligence playing a covert role in the civil war.","Boy, 6, found hanging from a rope tied to a swing on family's balcony .

Countless lives will be endangered by the Government’s ‘misguided’ privatisation of land and sea rescue service, critics warned Tuesday. Stranded mountain climbers and sailors on stricken ships will be put at risk by the decision to hand search and rescue (SAR) operations to a US company, it was claimed. A £1.6billion deal, confirmed yesterday, saw ministers wrench responsibility from the RAF and Royal Navy after 70 years, in favour of Texas-based Bristow Group. At risk: Rescue helicopter services such as those flown by Prince William, will now be operated by a private American company . The Government pushed ahead with the sale despite objections from Prince William, a Flight Lieutenant who commands a SAR crew at RAF Valley in Anglesey, North Wales. As ministers announced the plans, the prince was believed to have been at the controls of an RAF helicopter that rescued a family stranded by wintry weather on a Welsh hillside. A family of five, including a 16-month-old baby, were cut off by 10ft snowdrifts and had been forced to burn furniture to keep warm after a power cut. They believe the Duke of Cambridge, known as Flight Lieutenant Wales when on duty, was flying the Sea King that plucked them to safety. One of those rescued, Ben Massam, 22, a shopworker from Bryneglwys, near Llangollen, said: ‘I’m grateful to the RAF, they did a brilliant job.’ He said of the privatisation: ‘If it ain’t bust, don’t fix it.’ Mercy mission: Prince William leaves a Sea King helicopter, which will be replaced as part of the plans . Bristow will also take over civilian SAR bases run by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). Until 2007, Bristow had run rescue missions for the MCA for 24 years. But . concerns have been raised because Bristow is axing two of the 12 SAR . bases and reducing the total helicopter fleet from 24 to 22. The deal . also spells the end for the distinctive yellow Sea King helicopters, in . favour of Sikorsky S92 and AgustaWestland AW189 aircraft. The . Department for Transport said that under the new regime rescuers will . reach emergencies more swiftly and could cover larger areas of the . country. But defence analyst Howard Wheeldon said privatising such . services ‘brings a lot of dangers’, adding: 'Going to a PFI, which this essentially is, brings a lot of dangers.' Callouts have gone up 40 per cent since 2005, this is a big operation, a lot of people's lives are at risk here. 'Will the private sector operation take on the same sort of risks that the RAF, Royal Navy and Maritime and Coastguard Agency do, on the same scale? I rather doubt they will.' Bristow, the Texan firm that won the contract, will use the Sikorsky S-92 helicopter, which it already uses to transport offshore oil workers in the UK . Angus . Robertson, Scottish National Party defence spokesman, said: ‘The . privatisation of military helicopter search and rescue services is . misguided. It will end the role of military air crew in these . life-saving flights, which is a bad move. ‘The public has come to trust and value the military search and rescue service and this privatisation is wrong.’ The lucrative ten-year contract, starting in 2015, will be managed by the MCA. All bases will operate 24 hours a day. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘Our SAR helicopter service plays a crucial role. ‘The public can have great confidence in Bristow and its ability to deliver a first-class service.’ Military personnel involved in SAR will be able to apply to leave the service and take a job with the private contractor. The changes are not expected to directly impact the Duke of Cambridge who is due to finish as a SAR pilot later this spring.","U.S. private firm Bristow Group will take over helicopter rescue service .

So, MailOnline has teamed up with developers Codemasters to answer your questions. Fans grilled Iain Smith, producer for the game, set for release on May 28. Does Codemasters still have the licences for BTCC, DTM and V8 Supercars? If so, what has stopped you from implementing these series into the GRID games, and if not how difficult and expensive would it be to obtain them once again? Smith: 'We would license those properties on a game by game basis – there’s no reason why not further down the line, but right now our focus is on the GRID franchise and what that means for gamers – a comprehensive racing experience. 'That not only contains licensed touring and super-touring cars, but a vast array of other motorsports, race-modified road cars and supercars for players to get their hands on. By including this eclectic content we created our own series called the World Series Racing championship (WSR) to house them all in in a realistic way. It is all backed up by ESPN coverage to make the organisation live and breathe like a real entity.' Drifting away: Expect fan favourites such as the Nissan 370Z (right) to make an appearance . Why is there no Le Mans? Smith: 'With each new game we want to bring a fresh set of content for players to try out, and maybe throw some iconic stuff from the heritage of the GRID and RaceDriver series in the mix too. Because Le Mans featured in GRID 1, we didn’t necessarily want that to be a first choice in GRID 2 before we locked down on plans for our newer content. 'The new content in GRID 2 includes circuits, street racing tracks and point to point road racing, so it meant the choices for traditional circuits were of poured over all the more clinically, before going for the places we chose in the end. 'We’ve got Brands Hatch, Indianapolis, Portimao Algarve, the Red Bull Ring and Yas Marina in the title, which give a really international feel to the game. But there’s nothing to say pulling the Le Mans track back into the game at some point down the line cannot happen.' Can any car be picked for any type of race on any track? Smith: 'Within the Custom Race area of the game that’s pretty much the case yes! Players can choose to drive open-wheel sportscars on point to point tracks if they so wish. You’ll also be able to define the route, the light condition and the rules of the event. However, the Career mode has a more realistic approach of placing appropriate vehicles into events and circuits you’d expect. 'Part of the thrust of what GRID 2 is all about, is that we’re finding the best driver in the world in World Series Racing –it’s mixed discipline, like a decathlon of motorsports. Each driver will try events outside their standard comfort zone. 'So for that reason, the events are set up as realistically as possible – open wheelers on traditional circuits and drift machines on city tracks or weaving point to points.' Ruling the road: The ferocious Nissan GTR will take all of your skill to bring under control . I've only seen Liveries, Paint & Wheel Options - what about Body Mods, Engine & Suspension Upgrades and Customizations? Smith: 'The online side of the game has vehicle upgrades which affect the performance of the car – it’s this side of the game that comes alive as you spend your earned currency on improving your car to compete against the competition. 'But you also have choice there – you can save that currency and ultimately buy a much more powerful vehicle a little down the line if you can hold enough.' Will you be doing something to stop people 'driving dirty' online? Smith: 'Griefing was something we were really conscious to tackle in the GRID 2 multiplayer – I think  online there are never going to be complete solutions, but we’ve made some serious steps forward to resolve some of the worst parts. 'A large number of known “bad” behaviours have been added to our list of things to penalise players for – reversing off the start line, intentionally blocking others, staying still on the track – those things that you really don’t want to experience to break up your fun as you race have all been tackled. 'In addition, the way we match-make players in their lobbies online takes this into account their general “Impact Rating” and the degree to which players are in contact with others and generally breaking the rules whilst racing. 'If you’re serious about playing GRID and racing fairly, then you should be getting match-made with like-minded players.' Will there be splitscreen on PCs like in Dirt 3? Smith: 'Yes, we’ve included splitscreen for all platforms – it’s always fun to play with your opponent sitting right next to you!' Formula fun: As well as street-based events, there are races in stadiums using different breeds of car . Is there dynamic music and custom tracks? Smith: 'The system works based on multiple stems reacting to the player’s actions – if you are ahead, behind or way out in front of competition, if you’re racing in a pack tightly or if you have more space on track. 'In some cases the music is slightly more rigid in order to work with a game mode – for example, checkpoint works with a ticking timer that players need to keep alive, so the timing of the beats in that in-game score needs to work well. 'I think it’s a really fantastic touch, and helps to make the action on-track feel theatrical. With that said, it doesn’t appear in every race, as sometimes it’s not appropriate and can detract. We’ve balanced it very particularly.' What are the plans for DLC? Smith: 'Information about our DLC plan will be coming around launch time next week. In the interim, details of our pre-order bonuses are available on the GRID website and facebook page – my particular favourite is the Indycar pack featuring two new routes for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Dallara Indycar and Pacecar.' Is there day/night time for each location? Smith: 'We have day, night and dusk settings across most of the tracks and locations.' Leaving a mark: GRID games encourage you to master the drift, but veering off course can be devastating . What is the number of difficulty settings? Smith: 'Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard!' How did you come up with the LiveRoutes idea? Smith: 'LiveRoutes was a bi-product of wanting to offer more variation in what players see and play in the game. We were inspired a little by open world titles, but actually wanted to retain the sense of a “race” and avoid creating something to explore just for the sake of variety. 'This was a great alternative – really pulling in all the different parts of the cities that we’ve build but linking them in such a variety of ways that players will hardly ever see the same corner combinations come up twice.' What online features will there be? Smith: 'Online is a wholly separate part of the game, single player and online are selected separately right at the press start screen, so you’ll head down a completely alternate path and progression system. It has its own currency model and car customisation and upgrades are a key aspect of that. 'In addition, we have a rivals system to take on players across the world and a Global Challenge mode which utilises the RaceNet system. RaceNet really comes into its own with GRID 2 – it works from web to game as well as game to web, which is a big step for us.' Have the carmakers allowed random breakdowns and realistic damage or have your hands been tied to keep them happy? Smith: 'We always tread a very careful line with approvals from manufacturers and ultimately have to take their advice, but we have pushed things to be as realistic as possible. The vehicles will react more realistically than most of our competitors out there. 'We have full damage models for each car, have tyre shredding and wheel damage and the AI will occasionally pull up with engine issues – exactly as you’d expect from real life motorsports.'

Plants that were buried beneath glaciers in Canada more than 400 years ago, and were thought to have frozen to death, have been bought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems. Researchers now think these findings could have implications on how regions across the arctic, and antarctic, could recover as the ice covering them melts. Moss samples found in areas of the Canadian arctic exposed as the Teardrop glacier melts have been bought back to life. Researchers from the University of Alberta took the samples and grew cultures of the plants that were thought to have been buried during the Little Ice Age over 400 years ago. These are Aulacomnium turgidum, a relative of moss . The Little Ice Age was a period of cold and freezing temperatures that is thought to have cooled the Earth between 1550 and 1850 AD. Scientists believe there were three main cold snaps, one beginning about 1650, another about 1770 and the last is thought to have occurred in 1850. It is believed to have been caused by either a drop in solar radiation, volcanic activity, changes in the ocean circulation or drops in the human . population. The Little Ice Age brought colder winters to parts of Europe and North America. Farms and villages in the Swiss Alps were destroyed by glaciers during the mid-17th century. Canals and rivers in Great Britain and the Netherlands were frequently frozen deeply enough to support ice skating and winter festivals. The first River Thames frost fair was in 1607 and the last in 1814. During the Little Ice Age, the population of Iceland fell by half. Biologist Dr Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian arctic. Glaciers in the Canadian arctic region have been melting at around four metres each year, for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age, between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied. Including many species that have never been studied before. While inspecting an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small patch of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum. It is a type of bryophyte plant that mainly grows across Canada, the US, the highlands of Scotland. Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had . small patches of green stems, suggesting it was either growing again or could be encouraged to repopulate. Dr La Farge told the BBC: 'When we looked at them in detail and . brought them to the lab, I could see some of the stems actually had new . growth of green lateral branches, and that said to me that these guys . are regenerating in the field, and that blew my mind. 'If you think of ice sheets covering . the landscape, we've always thought that plants have to come in from . refugia around the margins of an ice system, never considering land . plants as coming out from underneath a glacier. The small patch in the middle of this image is Aulacomnium turgidum, a type of bryophyte plant. Researchers exploring the Teardrop glacier on the Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic discovered that the plant had green stems. Bryophytes can survive for long winters but scientists were surprised that the samples discovered were still green, even after being covered by ice for so long . Researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada have been exploring the receding Teardrop glacier in the Canadian arctic looking for new life. The region is melting at around four metres a year . 'It's a whole world of what's coming out from underneath the glaciers that really needs to be studied,' Dr La Farge said. 'The glaciers are disappearing pretty . fast - they're going to expose all this terrestrial vegetation, and . that's going to have a big impact. 'The glaciers are disappearing pretty . fast. 'We really have not examined all the . biological systems that exist in the world; we don't know it all.' Dr La Farge took samples of the moss and, using carbon dating, discovered that the plants date back around 400 years. This is thought to have been around the time that the Little Ice Age froze many parts of the world between 1550 and 1850 AD. Dr La Farge's team took the samples, ground up stem and leaf tissue and and planted them in dishes full of nutrient-rich potting soil. They fed the plants with water and managed to successfully grow 11 cultures from seven samples. The samples were from four separate species including Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Encalypta procera and Syntrichia ruralis. The moss plants found are types of byrophytes. Bryophytes can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer. However, Dr La Farge was surprised the plants had survived buried under ice for such a long period of time. La Farge's findings appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Moss found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been revived by Canadian scientists .

Flying in formation over the lunar surface, the two NASA probes - named Ebb and Flow - helped further our understanding of the early solar system. But Monday, in a dramatic climax to their mission, the two spacecraft plunged seconds apart into a mountain near the moon's North Pole. Afterward, NASA said it had dedicated the impact site in honor of mission team member, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space who died earlier this year. Scroll down for video .

Mapping the moon: Using a precision formation-flying technique, the twin GRAIL spacecraft -- Ebb and Flow -- have mapped the Moon's gravity field, as depicted in this artist's rendering. By design, the spot was far away from the Apollo landings and other historical sites. With their fuel running low, NASA was keen to prevent them from crashing near the historically important Apollo landing sites. Honoring: NASA said it had dedicated the impact site in honor of mission team member, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space who died earlier this year . And even the keenest stargazer would . not have spotted the two-washing machine sized probes as they impacted . at a speed of 3,800mph, as the collisions occurred on the dark side of . moon.

The mission, codenamed Grail - . Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory - was launched in September . 2011 from Cape Canaveral and has been deemed a success. The twin craft collected data about . the moon's gravity while orbiting at an average altitude of 34 miles, . revealing its surface is much thinner than previously thought, gouged . out by the impact of thousands of asteroids and comets. 'It is going to be difficult to say . goodbye to our little robotic twins,' says MIT professor Maria Zuber, . Grail principal investigator. 'Planetary science has advanced in a major . way because of their contributions.' Ebb and Flow conducted one final . experiment before their mission ends, firing their main engines until . their propellant tanks are empty in a bid to determine precisely the . amount of fuel left in their tanks. NASA engineers hope this information will help improve predictions of fuel needs for future missions. 'Our lunar twins may be in the . twilight of their operational lives, but one thing is for sure, they are . going down swinging,' said Grail project manager David Lehman of NASA's . Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Trajectory: The twin lunar-orbiting NASA spacecrafts went on a controlled crash into a site named after Sally Ride . Crash landing site: The map shows the region where the twin spacecraft of NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory mission will impact on Monday .

Blast Off: The $496 million Grail mission - short for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory - launched in September 2011, and Ebb and Flow reportedly arrived in lunar orbit about three months later. 'Even during the last half of their . last orbit, we are going to do an engineering experiment that could help . future missions operate more efficiently.'

Ebb and Flow focused exclusively on measuring the moon's lumpy gravity field in a bid to learn more about its interior and early history. After flying in formation for months, they produced the most detailed gravity maps of anybody in the solar system. Secrets long held by the moon are spilling out. Ebb and Flow discovered that the lunar crust is much thinner than scientists had imagined. And it was severely battered by asteroids and comets in the early years of the solar system - more than previously realized. Data so far also appeared to quash the theory that Earth once had two moons that collided and melded into the one we see today. Besides a scientific return, the mission allowed students to take their own pictures of craters and other lunar features as part of collaboration with a science education company founded by Ride, who died in July of pancreatic cancer at age 61. bout 3,600 classrooms around the world participated, sending back 114,000 photos.

When deciding to get married, it is important to focus on the question and never to make a snap decision. But that's exactly what Jerrit Pruyn did when he proposed to girlfriend Cara... by writing 'Marry Me' on the lens of his camera and asking her to take his picture. The professional photographer, from New York, took her to a vineyard in nearby Long Island under the guise of taking some romantic shots. But little did she know quite how romantic they would turn out to be. 'Marry Me': Here's what Cara saw the moment Jerrit dropped to one knee . Tears of joy: He said they were 'both in bits' after she said yes but managed to take this picture . 'I knew I wanted something intimate, original, unique and true to who we are,' Pruyn wrote on his blog. 'I had the idea to use a vintage camera and tripod as part of the proposal. Then the experimenting began to find the best way to incorporate this.' Not wanting to ruin the lens of his vintage Nikkormat SLR with ink, he needed a plan. So finally he came up with the idea of writing the words - backwards and upside down so they would appear the right way up when Cara peered through the viewfinder - on an iPhone screen protector which he duly placed on the camera's glass.

Jerrit says Cara didn't believe him at first but agreed through tears of joy . When the day finally arrived, they packed the car and drove to Duck Walk Vineyards with a bottle of wine and a picnic and went for a walk. He then suggested they take a picture together and set up the camera to face the vines. 'After setting everything up I pocketed the ring and went in front of the camera,' he wrote. 'I asked Cara to focus the camera on me so we could take a photo together. The ring: The 1920's single diamond filigree engagement ring. Purchased in Cara¿s college town of Ann Arbor, MI. 'I dropped to one knee and pulled the ring out as she looked through the camera. After many ""Oh my Gods"" and ""is this for real?s"", she accepted. She was more excited than I had imagined.'

The Queen has formally declared that a future daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be a princess. With a long-awaited royal baby due in late spring or early summer, the monarch has issued what is known as a Letters Patent to announce that the couple's baby would become an HRH – His or Her Royal Highness – even if she is a girl. In doing so, she rectified a century-old anomaly that meant a royal daughter would not automatically become a princess. Parents-to-be: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony at the Guildhall during a visit to Cambridge . A decree made by George V in 1917 stipulated that while a son would become a prince, a daughter would not become a princess. The king had ordered that the titles . HRH and prince and princess should be restricted to the children of the . sovereign, the children of the sovereign's sons, and the eldest son of . the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. That means that Princess Beatrice and . Princess Eugenie automatically had the title of princess at birth as . Prince Andrew's daughters, but Zara Phillips did not – although her . mother, Princess Anne, had already rejected titles for her children. Prince Edward's son and daughter were . similarly entitled but he and his wife Sophie chose for them to be . styled as the children of an earl in order to give them a more 'normal' childhood. They are now known as Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn. Royal sources said the Queen felt it was time such a long-standing imbalance was formally rectified. The Queen's proclamation was issued through the House of Lords on December 31 but made public only yesterday. The Queen rectified a century-old anomaly that meant a royal daughter would not automatically become a princess .

Buckingham Palace refused to comment . last night on the timing of the announcement and whether it meant that . Kate was now safely past the crucial 12-week stage of pregnancy. However, well-placed royal sources suggested that the Queen had been keen to make the announcement for some time. The duchess, who celebrated her 31st . birthday yesterday, was taken to hospital in early December with acute . pregnancy-related sickness and has retained a low profile ever since.

If anyone has ever wished to dine with the Romney family, this is probably the closest you'll get. The wife of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has written a cookbook full of recipes her family loves to eat. 'The Romney Family Table' promises recipes such as Ann's Welsh skillet cookies (the same ones she handed out to reporters during Mitt Romney's unsuccessful 2012 Presidential campaign), 'Mitt's Meatloaf Cakes' and homemade ice-cream. The book's focus on hearty and traditional recipes puts it in contrast with the efforts of the First Lady, Michelle Obama. The cookbook of Mormon: Former aspiring First Lady Ann Romney's cookbook contains recipes her family loves to eat, anecdotes about the family and cooking hints and tips . Obama's book, 'American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America' promotes healthy eating, and documents the growth of the kitchen garden she established at the White House. The book has a wide scope, taking in recipes, community gardens across the U.S., instructions for composting and historical information about First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's Victory Garden and Thomas Jefferson's attempts to grow a four-foot long cucumber. Easy being green: First Lady Michelle Obama's focus has been on healthy eating and growing organic vegetables in her own White House garden and community gardens around the country . The two have faced-off in the kitchen . before, in the Family Circle Cookie Contest in last year. Michelle . Obama's white and dark chocolate chip cookies edged out Ann Romney's . M&M cookies by several hundred votes. Publisher of Ann Romney's book Shadow Mountain, an imprint of the Mormon publisher Deseret, says Ann 'invites readers into her home and kitchen, combining some of her favorite foods with memories of raising a family. In 'The Romney Family Table', Ann shares a unique blend of heartwarming (and often humorous) stories, homegrown traditions, and hearty recipes that have brought her family together for more than forty years.' Ann says that for her, cooking is 'part of the most important occupation on earth—raising a family.' Baker: When Mitt Romney unsuccessfully ran for President against Barack Obama in 2012, Ann Romney wooed reporters with her homemade Welsh skillet cookies . With a husband, five children and 21 grandchildren, Ann has previously said she used to feel like a short-order cook, and when her last son left home she told her husband, 'You just ate your last home-cooked meal!' In her book, Ann shares 'some of the tips that have helped her along the way'. Busy: Since her husband's Presidential run, Ann Romney has been working on her cookbook, and the couple visited Book Expo America on Friday to promote the book . The nation has always had a fascination with the eating habits of political leaders, and the cooking skills of their wives. In 1952, it was Mamie Eisenhower's no-cook 'Million Dollar Fudge', made with Marshmallow Fluff. In the 1980s, it was Nancy Reagan's Monkey Bread. Allegedly, Martha Washington's crab soup remains a favorite in the White House. And let's not forget the Presidential Peanut Butter and Honey Sandwich - a favorite of George W Bush.

The pair pooled their expertise to set up Woof & Brew, which will start selling the tea in shops this week. The drink, which contains no real tea, was launched at the Crufts dog show in March and hundreds of orders have already been placed on the firm’s website. ‘People loved the idea of being able to sit down and have a cup of tea while their dogs had one as well,’ explained Mr Bennett, 47. ‘We’ve already sold out of our initial stock so we are making additional bags. ‘We’ve even had a couple of dog-friendly teashops and hotels that are interested in serving it alongside their normal teas.’ A lovely cuppa: Waffle shows his enthusiasm for the brew, a mixture of herbs, vitamins and minerals which, it is claimed, will help dogs live a 'happy and healthy life' Mr Bennett and Mr Kinch worked together with holistic vet Richard Allport, who carried out research into the medical benefits of certain herbs, to create the five blends of canine tea – ‘Adult’, ‘Senior’, ‘Skin & Coat’, ‘Performance’ and ‘Breath’. Ingredients include dill, dandelion, ginseng and seaweed. To brew the tea, owners are told to infuse the bag for four minutes in hot water, before adding cold water to cool the cuppa to suit canine tongues. Costing £9.99 for a pack of 28, the teabags might seem expensive, but each makes a litre of tea which can be stored in the fridge for a week. Mr Bennett said the company was adding two new blends, including ‘Posh Pooch’, which he described as ‘the Earl Grey tea for dogs’.

A British father drowned after he was persuaded to try whitewater rafting for the first time on some of the world’s most difficult rapids. Businessman Stephen Morton, 47, had just finished climbing North America’s highest peak, Mount McKinley in Alaska. But after completing the 19-day expedition, his three Dutch teammates – who were all experienced rafters – encouraged him to try the extreme sport before flying home. The boat carrying Mr Morton tipped over entering a dangerous category-five rapid known as the Zig Zag. All the men were thrown out of the raft, but Mr Morton struggled to recover in the icy cold water. He was pulled out and taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Last night, his grieving widow said she didn’t want her husband to pursue dangerous hobbies, but hadn’t stopped him in case he regretted missing out. Vanessa Langlois, 51, said: ‘It is really difficult if your spouse wants to climb mountains, which is dangerous. 'I would have preferred him not to go, but at the same time I thought he could not get to the end of his days and think: “I should have been able to do all of that”. 'I would not have wanted to stand in the way of who he was and those things that he wanted to.’ She added: ‘I don’t feel angry or anything. It was him. He had to do it, to challenge himself. 'He had a sense of adventure and he was always planning the next thing he was going to do. He was going to climb Everest next. ‘He phoned before he left for the rafting trip. He was so happy to have summited safely and was so happy to be coming home, talking about the gifts he was about to buy for the kids. ‘I cannot imagine what it is going to be like without him.’ Mr Morton, who grew up in Fife, lived in Cambridge with three daughters from a previous marriage as well as his seven-year-old son with Mrs Langlois. He is the fourth person to drown in the rapids over the past 20 years. Devastated: Stephen Morton and his wife Vanessa pictured on their wedding day. His widow has spoken of her anguish at his death . Just hours before he died, he wrote on Facebook: ‘In order to recuperate from the climb, I’ve bowed to peer pressure and we are off to do some Cat 5 whitewater rafting. Haven’t done rafting before, but when in Alaska …’ Mrs Langlois, 51, spent ten years with Mr Morton before they got married last July. She said her husband, who served in the Army after leaving school, was the ‘fittest he had ever been’. ‘He had trained meticulously beforehand. He was incredibly fit, he was incredibly strong,’ she said. Accident: Steven Morton, 47, from Cambridge, was washed out the raft into Kenai Peninsula's Six Mile Creek, pictured, on Monday afternoon with several other people (file photo) The experienced climber, who had previously tackled Kilimanjaro, spent months preparing for the £8,000 expedition during which he had to carry a nine-stone pack and pull a sledge for 19 days. All the rafters had undergone a test to see how well they would cope if they came out of the boat. However yesterday the company that organised the rafting admitted that Mr Morton did not ‘do particularly well’. Chuck Spaulding, the owner of the rafting company Nova Alaska, said the firm had started looking into the death but were ‘still putting the big picture together’.","Stephen Morton, 47, from Cambridge, fell in the water on Monday afternoon .

But Channel 4 is hoping a little Gallic flavour will encourage viewers to stay tuned during a unique ad break devised to mark the launch of a French zombie drama. In a UK first, the broadcaster will fill the break with adverts for brands like L'Oreal, Renault and Boursin cheese - all in the language of their native France. French flavour: Channel 4 is to screen the UK's first ad break broadcast entirely in French to mark the arrival of French zombie series The Returned - or Les Revenants - on Sunday . The adverts will include English subtitles for those not au fait with the language. It is thought it will be the first time an entire ad slot on UK television has been in a foreign tongue. A French voiceover will announce the three-and-a-half minute break during the opening episode of The Returned on Sunday June 9, which will be made up of adverts originally shown on TV in France. Jonathan Allan, sales director at Channel 4, said: 'We're really excited to bring the first entirely French ad break to Channel 4 to herald the arrival of our eagerly-awaited new zombie drama series - it should really make the ads fit within the context of the show and surprise the viewer.' The Returned, or Les Revenants, is a supernatural crime thriller set in an Alpine village where the inhabitants do not realise they have been dead for years. The first episode will air at 9pm on Channel 4 on June 9. Supernatural thriller: Most of the adverts will be for French brands, from L'Oreal hair products to Boursin cheese . Channel 4 plotted another eye-catching advertising stunt back in 2008 when it broadcast a live TV commercial during an episode of Come Dine With Me. The £500,000 stunt, to promote Honda, saw 19 expert skydivers, all equipped with cameras, leap from a plane and spell out the word 'Honda' as they plummeted through the air.

Jay-Z was in a Brooklyn state of mind last night as he performed an inaugural sold-out concert at the borough’s new Barclays Center to uproarious response. But the star-studded opening was tarnished in part due to protests that had taken place throughout the day, gathering in front of the grey domed arena which one person said resembled ‘Chris Christie’s old lumpy mattress.’ Three women with scales in their hands wore signs reading ‘Billionaires for Barclays’ in front of the $1billion arena. Many of the protestors who showed up were concerned that the new venue will mean overwhelming congestion and noise for nearby residents. Scroll down for video . Hello Brooklyn: Jay-Z performs to the sold-out crowd at the new Barclays Center in the New York borough . All of the lights: The rapper's performance was the first at the new Brooklyn stadium, meant to rival Manhattan's Madison Square Garden . New York state of mind: Wearing a jersey from the Brooklyn Nets, Jay-Z put on a stellar show . Others were protesting that the arrival of the large arena has brought an unwelcome shift to a diverse borough known for its gentler rent prices. ‘What we need is two-bedroom, three-bedroom units that are affordable,’ Pratt Area Community Council executive director Deborah Howard said. ‘They have skewed what is needed.’ The use of eminent domain also meant that residents were forced out of the area. Hundreds more will likely notice the cost of living will creep up, due to the proximity to Barclays. Similarly, Candace Carponter, a spokesperson for Develop Don’t Destroy Brooklyn, rallied people ahead of the opening saying that Barclays was a ‘monument to crazy capitalism,’ according to the New York Times. Jay-Z said that performing in his hometown was better than performing at the Grammys, Glastonbury or Coachella. He yelled to the crowd of 18,000: 'Nothing feels like tonight!' The arena was full of exciting concertgoers, as the chaotic crowd made way to their seats after waiting outside to enter the building. Jay-Z emerged onstage as a video about Brooklyn's history played in the background. He opened with his songs about Brooklyn - 'Where I'm From' and 'Brooklyn Go Hard.' He also performed two songs from fellow Brooklynite Notorious B.I.G. He then held a moment of silence for the late rap veteran. Anticipation: Music fans arrive for the first of eight Jay-Z shows which will open the Barclays Center . Who's in your pocket? A protester wearing a sandwich board that reads Billionaires For Barclays stands in front of the new arena on opening night . Sending a message: The group 'Don't Shoot NYC' also protested, this time against youth violence . He told the crowd when B.I.G.'s 'Juicy' played: 'Sing loud so he can hear you in heaven.' The rapper is the co-owner of the Brooklyn Nets, who will play at the new arena later this year. Earlier this week Jay-Z revealed that while he is happy to be seen as a high profile endorser of President Obama, at least one of his political ideas is more in line with Republican candidate Mitt Romney. 'I don’t even like the word politics,' he told MTV News. 'It implies something underhanded and I think we need less government.' The Brooklyn rapper recently hosted a $40,000 per plate fundraiser for President Obama, which raised a reported $4 million. 'I support Barack because I gotta respect that sort of vision. I gotta respect a man who is the first black President ever,' he said. The Barclays Center will rival Manhattan's Madison Square Garden for musical events. A number of acts have booked shows at the venue, including Barbra Streisand, Lady Gaga, Bob Dylan, Rihanna, Rush, The Who, Justin Bieber and Neil Young and Crazy Horse. Famous faces: Star Jones, left, and celebrity chef Mario Batali, right, were among the audience members . Freaky Friday: The Barclays Center welcomed fans of Jay-Z amid the haze of Friday night following a day of rain . To mark the stadium's opening, the New York Times asked readers what they thought the Barclays Center looked like and predictably the responses they received were not very complimentary. 'Chris Christie's old lumpy mattress,' was one description, comparing the New Jersey governor's bed to the rust coloured Barclays Center. Another reader called it 'A soggy Oreo', while someone else said 'In fifty years, if it is still standing, it will be called 'Iconic'. Submissions from those who live in the two neighborhood's most likely to be affected by the stadium, Park Slope and Prospect Heights, were slightly less forgiving about the $1 billion construction. Carolyn from stroller-mom populated Park Slope called it 'Urban blight!', while Clayton G who also hails from the affluent area called it 'A beached humpback whale.'. Chris Christie's lumpy old mattress? New Yorkers have been scathing describing what the new Barclays Center looks like after the New York Times asked its readers . The new Barclays Center basketball stadium has divided opinion in Brooklyn and officially opens tonight as Jay-Z plays a show . Finishing touches: Workers put the finishing touches to the main entrance of the Barclays Center last week . Other comparisons submitted included, 'a huge George Foreman grill', 'a rotting turtle', 'a rusty alligator skull with a pronounced underbite', 'An angry clam. An angry, angry clam' and 'the burned bagel that will choke Brooklyn.' Originally envisaged as part of developer Bruce Ratner's Atlantic Yards urban regeneration plan for downtown Brooklyn, the proposals for the stadium were caught up in years of eminent domain challenges from local residents, which were resolved at the boroughs supreme court in 2010. With no size-able parking lot, the stadium is relying on spectators to make use of the extensive public transportation links to the arena, but residents worry about the extra cars and parking issues that will inevitably crop up. However, some of the likenesses seen by readers of the New York Times are positive, looking forward to the Barclays Center bringing new impetus to the already booming and confident borough of Brooklyn. 'Mega burger, medium well, pickle on the side', wrote in one hungry reader while another ignored the architecture to take a swipe at the Brooklyn Nets calling the arena  'An easy road win for the Milwaukee Bucks.' For Jay-Z though, tonight is his home-coming concert, having grown up a few blocks from Atlantic Avenue and the Long Island Rail Road. Work in progress: A July 2011 aerial picture shows construction of the Barclays Center, which has been racked with controversy since its inception . The 42-year-old music mogul and entrepreneur says when he was a poor kid Brooklyn growing up in the nearby Marcy projects, he never imagined that he'd someday own a basketball team. Now Jay is part owner of the Brooklyn Nets and instrumental in moving the franchise from New Jersey. He feels his rags-to-riches story embodies all that is possible in America. 'Yeah I think I'm the American dream,' Jay-Z said. 'That whole thing that you could come here and pull yourself up by the bootstraps, like that whole thing what America has always put up to the world that we represent. I feel that. Yes, I've lived that.' As a child, he says, he dreamed of glory on the basketball court. 'You know the three-two-one, oh, he hits the winning shot,' Jay-Z said. 'But no one was ever on the court saying I was gonna own the Knicks. Yes, it's way beyond any of my wildest dreams.' As part owner of the Nets, he's even designed the team's black and white logo. Ads for the team have been prominently displayed throughout the subway system with the tagline 'Hello Brooklyn.' Brooklyn has not had a professional sports team since the Brooklyn Dodgers left for Los Angeles after the 1957 baseball season.

Reform: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has decided criminals who are jailed for less than 12 months will be prevented from leaving Britain . All prisoners are to be banned from travelling abroad for up to 12 months after being released. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has decided that, for the first time, the 50,000 criminals a year who are jailed for less than 12 months will be prevented from leaving Britain if released on licence or under a ‘supervision period’. Mr Grayling said some of those released would also be prevented from moving around the country and would need permission from probation officers to spend a night away from their ‘approved’ residence. He believes that criminals released after short sentences should not be able to enjoy foreign holidays and should focus instead on finding a job in their local community. ‘We want to help offenders help themselves. 'If they are to finally step out from the gloomy shadows of criminality, they need to be given every chance,’ said Mr Grayling. ‘Sometimes that will mean taking a firm position and restricting someone’s movements. But it is for the purpose of giving them a better chance in life and helping them become law-abiding members of their community.’ Under current rules, anyone given more than a year in jail is banned from travelling abroad for 12 months and are returned to prison if they break the terms of their licence. Mr Grayling wants to apply this to those released after short sentences, such as disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, who served two months behind bars. Passports will not be confiscated but prisoners on licence are expected to report regularly to their probation officers. Former inmates will only be allowed to travel abroad in ‘exceptional’ circumstances, such as attending a close relative’s funeral. Under current rules, anyone given more than a year in jail is banned from travelling abroad for 12 months . Foreign travel prohibition for prisoners released after short sentences is being introduced in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, and can now be imposed as part of a community order or suspended sentence order. Mr Grayling has also ordered a review of the sentencing regime, introduced by Tony Blair a decade ago, which allows all but the worst offenders to be released halfway into their sentences. Instead of being freed automatically, the most serious violent and sexual offenders will have to earn the right to be released by taking classes or working while behind bars. Private firms and charities are also to be paid to provide mentors, including reformed prisoners, to meet every offender at the prison gate and help turn them away from a life of crime. In the biggest shake-up of prisoner rehabilitation for more than a century, Mr Grayling is to pay organisations if they prevent inmates reoffending after release. The move has infuriated probation officers, who say 70 per cent of their work will be put out to tender and they claim that it would put public safety at risk. Mr Grayling will insist that radical steps are needed to address high reoffending rates which mean almost half of all prison-leavers are reconvicted within 12 months. For those serving less than a year that figure is almost 58 per cent.","Criminals jailed for less than 12 months will not be able to leave Britain if released on licence .

Many years may have passed since they last met, but the bonds of friendship among these women have clearly stood the test of time. But this is a reunion that, until recently, seemed impossible because three of these former schoolfriends have spent the past 30-plus years thinking one of their old gang was dead. They found out they were wrong when Christine Greenslade, now 66, decided to trace the chums she grew up with in Penzance, Cornwall. Together again: Christine Greenslade, 66 met her long-lost friends in a tearful reunion this week. Pictured left to right: Jane Woodall,Viv Allbright, Christine Greenslade and Linda Turney . Mistaken: The three schoolfriends were stunned to hear Christine Greenslade was alive after believing she had died 30 years ago . Memory lane: The women this week returned to this pub, where the last photo of them was taken. Pictured left to right Audrey Upton, Viv Allbright (standing) Jane Woodall, Christine and Linda Turney . When she got in touch, they were stunned to hear she was alive after reading of her ‘untimely’ death in a newspaper obituary in 1980. The mix-up happened when Mrs Greenslade’s mother, Pamela, died of cancer and her daughter wanted to let her former community know. The family had moved to Ipswich and Mrs Greenslade phoned the local newspaper in their native Cornwall to place an obituary. But the paper confused the women’s names and told readers that Christine had died aged 34. Botched: Christine Greenslade placed an obituary for her mother in Cornish newspaper in 1980 but the Cornishman accidentally printed Christine's name instead of her mother's . Mrs Greenslade, a painter who now lives in France, discovered the bungle after revisiting her first home and phoning friends from St Gertrude’s Convent. Four of the gang have now met up 50 years on from when they were last pictured together – in the same pub. The original photo showed Mrs Greenslade alongside Audrey Upton, Viv Albright, Jane Woodall (now Johnson) and Linda Turney. They met again at the Admiral Benbow pub after Mrs Greenslade invited them for a drink. Mrs Greenslade said: ‘It is obviously fantastic to see everyone. 'When I got in touch with Viv Albright she sounded very odd. She rang me back and said, “I’m terribly sorry, but we all thought you were dead”.’ Mrs Johnson, 66, from Ironbridge, Shropshire, said: ‘Chris is one of my oldest friends and to have lost her all those years because of a silly mix-up was terrible.’ The only one missing from the original line-up was Mrs Upton. Mrs Greenslade said: ‘We’d absolutely love to hear from her.’","Christine Greenslade, 66, moved away with family from Cornish hometown .

One of the organisers of yesterday’s . star-studded Chime For Change concert has criticised the BBC for . refusing to broadcast the event live — saying it is obsessed with . sending staff on a ‘jolly’ to Glastonbury. Harvey Goldsmith, the promoter who helped assemble yesterday’s stellar line-up, said he was disappointed that the Corporation declined his request that the gig, for the empowerment of women in the developing world, should go out live. Instead British viewers made do with an hour of highlights aired on BBC1 at 10.50pm, 20 minutes after the event, which featured performances by Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Rita Ora and Florence + The Machine, had finished. Mr Goldsmith, who co-organised the 1985 Live Aid Concert,  said: ‘The idea behind the concert is to launch a charity which will help millions of women and young girls around the world. In a lot of countries it went out live. In fact in most of them. ‘I am disappointed that the BBC did not broadcast the event live. I think all the BBC is interested is in Glastonbury. ‘They have got about five million people working on it. It’s their jolly and everything else gets short shrift.’ A global audience of more than one billion in more than 150 countries was expected to tune into yesterday’s show from Twickenham Stadium. The event was the brainchild of Beyoncé, actress Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini, the creative director for Gucci. Each of the women, who are friends, has responsibility for a particular area of social policy within the charity and together they chose the acts for last night’s show. Disappointed: Harvey Goldsmith has hit out at the BBC for declining to broadcasting his gig for women live . Stellar cast: Stars including Jennifer Lopez, left, and Florence Welch of Florenche and the Machine, performed at the Chime For Change gig . The event featured promotional films about the charity’s causes  and A-list presenters including Madonna; Hollywood actors James Franco, Jessica Chastain and Jada Pinkett-Smith; Archbishop Desmond Tutu; feminist activist Gloria Steinem; and Hayek. Asked why the BBC hadn’t broadcast the event live, Mr Goldsmith replied: ‘Don’t ask me. The BBC gets stranger and stranger as the years go on.’ A spokesman for BBC1 said it had taken the decision to broadcast only highlights from the concert because the show had commercial sponsors. 'Jolly': Harvey Goldsmith accused the BBC of only being interested in covering Glastonbury (pictured) But Mr Goldsmith’s comments have put the spotlight on the BBC’s preparations for this years’ Glastonbury Festival, which begins on June 26 and will be headlined by The Rolling Stones. The Corporation is sending 296 staff to cover the festival – up on the 263 it sent in 2011 – and will even feature the event on Songs Of Praise and The One Show. But despite the hype, the BBC faces the prospect of being humiliated by The Rolling Stones, who are adamant they agreed to play Glastonbury for the fans – not the BBC. A BBC spokesman said that discussions with the Stones were ‘constructive and are ongoing’.","Live Aid promoter 'disappointed' at decision not to broadcast gig live .

A woman just released from the hospital after losing both arms, an eye, and an ear to her three pet pit bulls has now lent her voice in support of an ordinance that would toughen controls of the breed in her area. Linda Henry of Westwego, Louisiana, was nearly ripped apart May 12 when three of her four pet pit bulls, a breed commonly known for their ferocious temperament, brutally attacked her within inches of her life. Now out of the hospital, the still shell-shocked 54-year-old says she supports a Westwego lawmaker’s attempts to put stiff restrictions on the breed through a city ordinance. Change of heart: Linda Henry was ripped apart by her three pit bulls, losing both her arms and nearly her life, and now she supports strict legislation covering the breed . Henry recalled her brutal ordeal exclusively to WGNO Thursday. ‘They just grabbed me,’ she recalled solemnly, her head wrapped in gauze. ‘One grabbed this arm and the other grabbed the other arm and they just pulled me down and I was screaming and hollering.’ The bites exposed the bone of her limbs and skull as she screamed for help. ‘They grab my left leg and rip all that up then they tried to get my eye ball out.’ Henry said. ‘They ripped my eye lids off, they bit my lip then they grabbed my head.’ she said. Tragic: Here Henry sits with her common law husband at their Westwego, Louisiana home. Clarence Allen says he never wants a pit bull again, though the family once owned four or more . Thankfully, a neighbor heard Henry’s cries and called police. What officials and relatives found was shocking. ‘Her eyeball was gone,’ Cardell Henry, Linda’s nephew, told WGNO. And what the victim’s sister saw was just as unreal. ‘With the skin ripped open and fell to the front of her face. All of this was straight up skull,’ Elaine Hamilton told the New Orleans CBS affiliate. Henry survived surgery, but both her arms had to be amputated. Inspired by Henry’s ordeal, Westwego City Councilman Glen Green wants to make sure her harrowing tale is the last of its kind in his town. Then & Now: At right is Henry prior to the attacks by 3 of her pit bulls that left her missing an ear, an eye, and part of her skull, right . He says his ordinance, which is still being drafted, isn’t anti-pit bull but rather a means of ensuring that circumstances like those that led up to Henry’s attack by educating dog owners. However, many locals disagree. ‘Some people have called for it; some people have called and written against it,’ said Mayor John Shaddinger. Opponents have even started a petition against the proposed ordinance, which is scheduled for a July review. Dangerous beauty: Pit bulls, like the one pictured, have a troubled history with people. The proposed Westwego legislation is one of many proposed and passed laws governing ownership of the dog in America . ‘All of these people submitting petitions did not get to see Linda Henry after that dog attack, Green told WGNO. ‘Had they seen this lady or went to visit her in the hospital like I did I probably wouldn’t be getting very many petitions.’ One proponent of the ordinance is a man who visited Henry more than most. ‘I never want another pit bull,’ said Linda’s common law husband Clarence Allen, ‘ because of what happened here.’",Linda Henry was torn apart by her three beloved dogs and wants lawmakers to ensure such a tragedy never happens again .

The regime of President Bashar Assad has suffered another serious blow after his younger brother and enforcer Maher Assad lost a leg in a bomb blast which devastated the Syrian security hierarchy last month. Maher Assad, who is known for his brutality and commands key government units fighting against the Syrian rebels, was injured in the Damascus bombing on July 18 which also claimed the life of his brother-in-law Assef Shawkat and the defence minister Dawoud Rajha. The news comes as the Assad . regime appears to be teetering on the brink after former foreign minister Farouk al-Sharaa defected to the rebels. Injured: Maher Assad (left) seen here with his brother, President Bashar Assad, is believed to have lost a leg in a bomb blast last month . The defection of Mr al-Sharaa is a big loss for the government and comes after former prime minister Riyad Hijab defected earlier this month. Mr al-Sharaa was one of the regime's most senior figures and had served both President Assad and his father Hafez for more than 20 years. The Syrian Government has become . increasingly isolated following its brutal attempts to suppress the . uprising, including ordering shelling and air strikes on cities such as . Aleppo and Homs. It is now reported to control just 30 per cent of the country, with the rebels beginning to gain momentum. His brother-in-law Assef Shawkat (pictured left) died in the attack in Damascus on July 18. The former foreign minister Farouk al-Sharaa (right) has announced his defection to the rebels . The country has been suspended from the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, while Arab diplomats are believed to have been calling on the regime to cease the bombing. The United Nations estimates that around 2.5 million refugees are in need of food, shelter and medical supplies within Syria, with thousands trying to reach the relative safety of camps in neighbouring states.

After blowing more than $5 million in his first two seasons in the NFL on things like multiple BMWs and suped-up Dodge Chargers, New York Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie has turned over a new leaf - he's traded the fancy Beemers for a fuel-efficient Toyota Prius and has recommitted himself to financial discipline. In an interview with Newsday, Cromartie tells reporter Bob Glauber that his days of reckless spending have come to an end and that he is 'all about saving money.' 'I was out of control,' Cromartie said. 'I remember [former Chargers teammate] Quentin Jammer used to tell me to slow down, but I couldn't do it. I just loved spending money.' Bye-bye, bling! Antonio Cromartie says he now 'all about saving money' after blowing more than $5 million during his first two seasons . For example, at one point, Cromartie had 'nine cars, two expensive homes, piles of jewelry, [gave] extravagant gifts and cash -- lots of cash -- to friends and family members who would simply ask, and shopping sprees that ran into the tens of thousands of dollars. Cromartie spent so much on so many things and so many people he can't even remember where it all went.' Of the cars - which included two Dodge Chargers, two BMWs, two Cadilacs and a 1965 Caprice - Cromartie says he spent upwards of $100,000 just to fix them up. Cromartie - who is the middle of a four-year, $32 million contract with the Jets - has now recruited the help of a financial adviser, who credits the transformation to showing the 29-year-old athlete what it's like to have a 'settled' home life. Proud papa: Cromartie with his wife and two of his 12 children . 'I can tell a lot of things to a lot of clients, but that doesn't mean they'll listen and accept what I say and practice that discipline,' Cromartie's adviser Jonathan Schwartz said. '[Cromartie] buys into it. He knows that a professional athlete's earning period is limited, and that the best form of accumulating wealth is not to spend. His peers will go buy Rolls Royces and Ferraris and diamond jewelry, but 25 years from now, Antonio can still maintain his lifestyle, sit at the beach enjoying a cocktail and say, ""I've earned it.'"" Cromartie, who has 12 children with eight different women in six different states, says he wants to be a role-model for younger players who might be tempted to make the same mistakes he made as a young athlete with a lot of money. 'I tell the young guys, ""'Don't spend any money the first year and a half of your career,'"" Cromartie said. 'You don't know what will happen after that. You might be released. You might be hurt. Just save your money.' Filthy rich: Antonio Cromartie currently is in the middle of a 4-year, $32 million contract with the New York Jets .","Antonio Cromartie is now 'all about saving money'

Banks are still starving businesses of the cash they need to thrive in a serious threat to the economic recovery, figures showed yesterday. The Bank of England said lending to British firms fell by £3billion in April - the biggest slump so far this year. Lending to small businesses was down £660million in yet another sign that the government’s flagship Funding for Lending Scheme is not working. The Bank of England (pictured) said lending to British firms fell by £3billion in April . The programme was launched by the Treasury and the Bank in August last year in an effort to get £80billion of cheap loans out to households and businesses. There is evidence that mortgage lending has increased but small firms in particular continue to be deprived of the funds they need to grow and create jobs. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘The Funding for Lending Scheme has not driven a recovery in borrowing yet. We continue to think that a strong and sustained economic recovery will remain elusive so long as overall bank lending remains this weak.’ The figures showed that lending to British businesses has fallen by more than £100billion since the start of 2009 in a punishing setback for the economy. The crisis has been highlighted by the Daily Mail’s Make the Banks Lend campaign which was launched nearly three years ago to draw attention to the desperate plight suffered by small firms at the hands of their banks. Mervyn King (pictured) admitted that the changes to the FLS are ¿not a gamechanger' Banks insist many companies do not want to borrow money because they are too scared about Britain’s uncertain economic future. But experts dismiss the claim as nonsense and the FLS was beefed up in April to focus on lending to small and medium-sized businesses - known as SMEs. John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said relying on the ‘big five’ banks - HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, RBS and Santander - ‘is clearly not working’. He said: ‘To get the recovery on a firmer footing businesses need to access finance and greater competition in the banking sector should help this. Business confidence is up, suggesting firms want to invest but to do this many need the finance to make it happen.’ Bank governor Sir Mervyn King, who retires at the end of this month after 10 years in the job, has admitted that the changes to the FLS are ‘not a gamechanger’. More than half of small firms in some parts of Britain have been rejected by their bank for a loan over the last two year, according to a recent report by the research firm BDRC Continental. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest data from the Bank showed why officials felt the need to extend the FLS. ‘The FLS has so far failed to have any material impact in lifting bank lending to companies. ‘Of course, it needs to be borne in mind that low lending levels to companies have reflected weak demand as well as supply factors. ‘How much companies want to borrow going forward remains questionable, but it is important for UK growth hopes that all companies who are in decent shape and who do want to borrow - whether it be to support their operations, lift investment, explore new markets - can do so, and at a non-punishing interest rate. This applies to all companies, whatever their size.’","The Bank of England said lending to British firms fell by £3billion in April .

Bleak prediction: Olivier Blanchard said Germany would have to accept higher inflation and a real strengthening of its purchasing power as part of the solution to Europe's problems . The world is not even halfway through the financial crisis and should brace itself for another six years of turmoil, according to a leading global watchdog. Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said it will take at least ten years to recover from the meltdown caused by the banking crash of 2008. He added: ‘It is not yet a lost decade but it will surely take at least a decade from the beginning of the crisis for the world economy to get back to decent shape.’ The warning came amid signs that Britain has finally emerged from the longest double dip recession since the Second World War. Experts predict that the economy grew by 0.6 per cent between July and September – the first quarter of growth since the same period last year. But with the eurozone crisis threatening to spiral out of control, the US approaching a debt storm, and the global economy slowing from China to Brazil, the outlook remains bleak. Economist Gerard Lyons said: ‘Is the global economy heading into another recession? 'This is now becoming a genuine possibility. Business confidence has deteriorated. Worries about the euro appear to have been the trigger for this.’ Price control: Blanchard said that adjustment in the euro zone required a decrease in prices in the bloc's indebted southern half, such as Spain and Greece (pictured), and a rise in core countries . Business Secretary Vince Cable yesterday admitted the turmoil was far from over. He said: ‘We are in a very deep crisis centred on the collapse of the banking system.

In these days of airbrushing on an industrial scale, we're not used to seeing models' lumps and bumps. But Cara Delevingne had no qualms about showing off her imperfections as she strutted down the catwalk at the Versace fashion show. The British model of the moment sported some rather vicious-looking marks on her right shin and foot. The thigh-high split in the red Versace gown revealed angry red blemishes on the legs of 20-year-old Cara Delevingne . Cara Delevingne had a number of angry red bruises as she strutted down the catwalk at Milan fashion week . Not that they seemed to faze the . 20-year-old, who looked a picture of confidence in a split-to-the-thigh . red silk gown with precariously positioned spikes around the neck. It is not known how she sustained the wounds but Miss Delevingne revealed at the weekend that she suffers from psoriasis. Writing on social networking site Twitter, she said: 'Be gone psoriasis, you're no fun!' The skin condition, which causes red scaly patches, can be made worse by stress, drinking and smoking, among other triggers. Impressive number of appearances: Cara has clocked up an impressive number of catwalk appearances over the last few weeks . Just days before the Versace show in . Milan, she was pictured stumbling out of a London house party after 13 . hours on the town – certainly living up to photographer Mario Testino's . recent declaration that she is the new Kate Moss. Celebrations started at 4pm, after . she appeared in the Burberry fashion show. By 6.30pm she was with friend . and fellow model Georgia May Jagger, daughter of Sir Mick, in an East . London pub. Afterwards, she went to a concert in West London where she bumped into One Direction star Harry Styles.

As from the moment you're launched into the sky-high dystopia, Bioshock Infinite's vice-like grip takes hold, and won't let you go. You play Booker DeWitt, a former agent with the Pinkerton Detective agency. He's sent to the floating city in search of a young woman called Elizabeth, who's been held captive there for 12 years. To make matters worse, she's guarded by an enormous robo-bird called the Songbird, and the city's in the middle of a civil war - not helped by main antagonist, Zachary Comstock. What a view: There's no denying that Infinite looks great but to get the most out of it you have to play on PC . Cue typical Bioshock gameplay - where combat revolves around a combination of weapons and powers, as Booker and Elizabeth try to escape from Columbia. Not that you'd want to, given just how beautiful the game looks. Whether it's admiring the quaint, Venetian splendor of the architecture, or just watching Columbia's dwellers get on with their lives, Infinite's art direction alone stands head and shoulders above most other stuff out there. It must be said, though, that the game's visuals fall victim of aging console hardware. Whereas 'Ultra' settings on PC captures every intricate detail, maintains a smooth framerate and just feels 'alive', consoles look flat in comparison - with bland textures, some minor framerate hiccups and uninspiring character models. What has evolved, though, is the combat. Although you start the game on your own, you'll soon have Elizabeth as a companion. You can ask her to teleport certain features - be that a turret or a stash of medical supplies. Run low on ammo, and she'll even toss you some clips. Infinite lets you play how you want to, and given how reliant you are on Elizabeth, you soon feel compelled to protect her. In fact, Infinite is the first game in a while where the player isn't the star. This is Elizabeth's show - and Irrational Games have made sure her AI always takes the lead and dictates the pace between gunfights. Sadly, it's not perfect. You'll see her launch ammo through solid walls, her movement can be extremely unnatural and stiff and she'll sometimes get in the way. Perhaps most annoying is when you run out of health and she rescues you - locking you into the same, boring revival sequence that gets tiresome very quickly. Blown away: Along with a variety of man-made weapons, Booker can use Vigor to devastating effect . A new feature in Infinite is the skyline system - a rollercoaster-like rail network that allows you to hook on and traverse areas quickly. It's fast enough to give a real sensation of speed, but you always feel in control. This gives battles a multi-layered aspect. Either go in all guns blazing at ground level, or zip to a high structure and snipe - the choice is yours, and it all feels much more refined than, say, Dishonored. Bioshock Infinite looks its best on PC. Our testing unit runs on an Nvidia 680GTX graphics card - which allows the game to run at the highest settings with a smooth framerate. The cheaper 670GTX model is a powerful alternative. The AMD Radeon XFX card may be worth a look, too, for those chasing top-quality graphics. The impressive array of powers - called vigors - more than make up for the slightly unoriginal armoury of pistols and shotguns. Gone are Adam and Eve, replaced by Salt. These allow you to cast fireballs, launch a flock of hungry birds and shoot electricity from your fingertips. All are a joy to use, each one resulting in their own gruesome fatalities. Enemy AI generally works well - preferring the 'charge on sight' approach. Sometimes, though, they'll casually walk past their dead comrades or get jammed in the scenery. No matter, as Infinite is at its best away from the frantic, and slightly repetitive, combat. The opening 20-or-so minutes when you're walking around Columbia like a lost tourist is one of the most memorable sections of recent years. Bioshock Infinite may not be perfect, but it more than deserves its place nestled in the gaming stratosphere. Bioshock Infinite is out now. NOW SEE THE GAME IN ACTION: .

Half of the biggest companies working in the UK have headquarters overseas, many in low-tax regimes, it was revealed yesterday. Britain’s most senior tax official made the admission as she was slammed for ‘failing to get to grips with tax avoidance’ by an influential group of MPs. It came as the Government launched a crackdown on multi-national giants that slash their tax bills by using complex legal techniques to funnel profits overseas. Under fire: HMRC chief executive Lin Homer (above) has been criticised by MPs for not tackling Britain's biggest firms which avoid tax by having HQ's overseas . Public outrage over the issue was triggered after it emerged that a long list of global giants including Starbucks, Google, Facebook, Amazon and eBay pay relatively minuscule tax bills in the UK. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has a list of the 770 largest companies operating in the country, so that it can keep tabs on their tax contributions. Probed yesterday by the Public Accounts Committee, HMRC’s chief executive Lin Homer conceded ‘around half’ had HQs outside Britain, often in low-tax regimes such as Ireland and Luxembourg, making it easier to avoid paying their fair share. By its own admission, HMRC has a tax gap of £32.2billion of uncollected revenue. The committee’s chairman, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, said there had been ‘hardly any progress’ since 2004, when the same gap was just over £33billion. 'Going easy on the big boys': Public outrage over the issue was triggered after it emerged that a long list of global giants including Starbucks (above) pay relatively minuscule tax bills in the UK . 'Getting off lightly': Facebook is another company which contributes relatively little to the UK's public purse . The committee also lambasted Mrs Homer for pursuing small and medium-sized businesses more zealously than large companies. Labour MP Austin Mitchell said: ‘You go easy on the big boys and go harder on the companies that can’t leave and have to pay their tax here.’ Mrs Homer said: ‘All that HMRC can do is to apply the law and multinational businesses can choose where they are based and where their profits are based.’ It came as George Osborne launched an international effort to tackle tax scrimpers. Teaming up with his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schauble, the Chancellor called for ‘concerted international co-operation’ to strengthen tax standards’.","Government launches crackdown on multi-nationals which dodge tax using complex legal techniques .

Police fear a retired park ranger accused of gunning down his daughter-in-law before fleeing into the wilderness of upstate New York seven-months ago is alive and still on the run. Authorities previously believed that 73-year-old Eugene Palmer of Stoney Point was dead after escaping into Herriman State Park only moments after allegedly admitting to committing the cold-blooded crime. After a manhunt failed to retrieve a body from the woods, Sgt. George Lutz of the Haverstraw Police Department told Fox News: 'We consider him to be armed and dangerous.' Police accuse Palmer of fatally shooting Tammy Palmer, 39, three times as she was walking home from dropping her two children off at a school bus on September 24th. After allegedly confessing to the crime to his sister, Elaine Babcock, she says he took off into the 45,000-acre park, an area authorities say he's well familiar with and backs onto their property. 'We thoroughly searched these woods over the course of two weeks, I don't believe he's here,' Sgt Lutz said. 'He knows that park like the back of his hand.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Killed: Tammy Palmer, pictured right with her two children, was shot dead on Monday September 24 after walking her children to a school bus stop . Authorities at the time thought there was no chance he could have survived the woods considering the impending winter's freezing temperatures. Palmer's son also says he's convinced his father's dead with the 73-year-old being a severe diabetic. Authorities' search has expanded internationally as well. Palmer was charged with the murder of Tammy Palmer two months after she was killed.

Great escape: Authorities say they have combed through Harriman State Park's 45,000-acres (pictured) since his disappearance but have yet to find a body . The order prevented him from entering . the home where she was raising their two children, aged 12 and 16. She . lived in a separate house but on the same property as her father-in-law. Babcock, Palmer's sister claimed he rushed to her house straight after the killing and admitted what he'd done. 'He just came in and said, ""Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough.

A pregnant Polish migrant launched a blistering racist verbal attack on two young Muslim women wearing hijab headscarves and told them to ‘go back to your own country’, a court heard. Drunk Beata Jopek shouted at the two passengers on a Yorkshire train, screaming ‘no-one wants you here, you are f****** disgusting.’ The British women were left ‘fearing for their safety’ as Jopek, 30, told one of them: ‘Take that f****** thing off, a white person wouldn’t do what you are doing.’ Jopek then ripped the headscarf from one of the women and when restrained by a guard said: ‘If I lose the baby I’m going to kill the black b****.’ The drunken foul-mouthed tirade ended with Jopek and her partner Maciej Matysniak, 32, being arrested for what a judge called their ‘yobbish’ behaviour towards Hana Farah and Ithil Ibrahim. Jopek narrowly escaped a prison sentence after both women said they would rather the foul-mouthed Poles, who have lived in England for some years, be made to recognise what they did was wrong rather than go to jail. Yobs: Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, heard that Jopek racially abused and even pulled off a victim's hijab on a train to Barnsley . Prosecutor Jim Baird told Sheffield Crown Court that the women were travelling on the 9.30pm train from Leeds to Sheffield after visiting a friend in hospital. About 15 minutes into the journey Matysniak approached them and swore. ‘Shut the f*** up”, why are you so “f****** loud, aren’t you embarrassed about how loud you are? You can’t even speak English,’ he said. The two Muslims felt frightened and intimidated by Matysniak who was clearly drunk. Punishment: Judge Michael Murphy, pictured, saved the woman from jail after her victims said that they would rather she understood what she had done . Miss Farah told him to go away and leave the women alone but that incensed his partner Jopek who was also drunk and got to her feet and swore at the women saying: ‘Don’t talk to him like that he’s only telling the truth.’ Passengers intervened as Jopek tried to get to the pair but was restrained by her partner. She then launched her foul-mouthed racist tirade ‘because they were wearing hijab headscarves’, said Mr Baird. Jopek again approached the women as the train approached Barnsley station and she sat down opposite Miss Ibrahim making references to her headscarf and swore as she told her to take it off. The Pole grabbed at the hijab, pulling at Miss Ibrahim’s hair and the scarf came off. Police officers escorted the Poles off the train at Barnsley and they were so drunk they could not be interviewed until the next day when they had sobered up. Jopek refused to answer questions but her partner claimed the two women were shouting so loud passengers could not have a conversation. He also claimed one of them swore and gave him a finger gesture. Mr Baird said both women were ‘upset and shocked and nervous’ and anxious about travelling on trains. Miss Ibrahim had suffered depression since the incident for which she has received medical treatment. Jopek admitted racially aggravated common assault and Matysniak admitted threatening behaviour on January 30. They live in Barnsley. Heidi Cotton, for Jopek said she had drunk half a bottle of vodka despite being pregnant and added: ‘Drink is no longer her friend.’ Ian West for Matysniak said he took full responsibility for his actions but they were not racially motivated. Judge Michael Murphy told the Poles: ‘Courts cannot teach people to behave in a civilised way but a court can punish people who do not behave. This was disgraceful and drunken violence on a train. It was yobbish and uncivilised disgraceful behaviour in drink.’ Jopek was given a three-month jail term suspended for 12 months and 120 hours of unpaid community work. Matysniak was given a 12-month community order with 80 hours of unpaid work.","Beata Jopek had been drinking vodka and screamed abuse at victims Hana Farah and Ithil Ibrahim .

Archibald McKay, 46, from Possil, Glasgow, was convicted of attempting to murder 34-year-old Rashid Ali at the Spicy Bite in Saracen Street, Glasgow, on August 27, last year. The terrifying attack came after he had already previously been jailed for threatening to burn the shop down and had waged a campaign of fear against the businessman . Archibald McKay was standing outside the shop with a bottle in his hand and there were flames coming from the bottle . McKay appeared in court on a charge of assault to injury, danger of life and attempted murder with 'an ignited bottle containing fuel' The High Court in Glasgow heard that McKay was standing outside the shop with a bottle in his hand and there were flames coming from the bottle. Brave Mr Ali managed to prevent the bottle of burning fuel from being thrown inside the shop where he worked during the incident. The heroic worker tackled his attacker and as they wrestled to the ground the bottle fell. It then exploded into a fireball which engulfed McKay, Mr Ali's car and a nearby telephone box. A fire expert said that if McKay had . succeeded in firebombing the shop the consequences could have been . 'catastrophic' as there was only one way in and out of the shop. The ambush was captured on CCTV cameras and during the trial the jury was played the horrific footage. Prior to the murder bid McKay was jailed for threatening to burn down Mr Ali's takeaway . McKay appeared in court on a charge of assault to injury, danger of life and attempted murder with 'an ignited bottle containing fuel'. He claimed that it wasn't him in the CCTV clip and denied having anything to do with the murder bid. Jailing McKay Lady Scott told him: 'You took part in a campaign of violence against Mr Ali. 'On occasions you took food from his premises without paying. 'Your presence always carried menace towards Mr Ali.' Lady Scott added: 'Mr Ali has been left frightened and has lost his business.' Prior to the murder bid McKay was jailed for threatening to burn down Mr Ali's takeaway and was jailed at Glasgow Sheriff Court. McKay was out on licence for that offence when he decided to torch the premises. John Dunn, Procurator Fiscal of West of Scotland, said: 'This was a despicable act of violence which potentially could have carried with it far more serious consequences but for the presence of mind of the victim, Mr Ali, in thwarting his attacker's attempt to throw a bottle of burning fuel into his shop. 'The sentence imposed today properly reflects the views of the majority of people in our communities who want to live their lives free of the threat of violence, this type of conduct will not be tolerated.'","Archibald McKay, 46, from Possil, Glasgow, has been jailed for nine years .

Residents and plain English campaigners have criticised the decision but the council said apostrophes could only be found in three existing street names in the district. Proofreader Mary de Vere Taylor said abandoning apostrophes was a 'backward step' It added that Beck's Square and .

A Russian scientist has claimed that he has found the first fragments of a mystery object which caused a huge explosion over Siberia more than a century ago. The Tunguska Event in June 1908 saw a mysterious blast more powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb flatten trees over an 800 square mile radius, knock people from their feet and shatter windows. The widely accepted theory is that the explosion was caused by an asteroid or comet breaking up as it entered the Earth's atmosphere. Devastation: The Tunguska Event in June 1908 saw a mysterious blast more powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb flatten trees over an 800 square mile radius, knock people from their feet and shatter windows . Discovery: A Russian scientist has claimed that these rocks are from a comet or asteroid which caused the Tunguska incident. He has nicknamed them (1) dental crown, (2) whale, and (3) boat . But with no evidence of a comet, just one death and few witnesses, experts have been left baffled over its cause through the decades. Now, Andrei Zlobin believes he has found the first fragments of the unknown object which devastated an entire area. He found the rocks on an exploration of the area back in 1988 and collected more than 100 rocks from the bed of the nearby Khushmo River. But it was only on examination of the rocks two decades later in 2008 that Zlobin, of the Vernadsky State Geology useum in Moscow, found three that showed signs of melting and regmaglypt impressions in them. Explorer: Andrei Zlobin pictured on his expedition in 1988 . They are sometimes created when a space rock makes a fiery entry into Earth's atmosphere. He believes that the explosion would not have created enough heat to melt the rocks if they were already on the ground and believes that the rocks were heated during the explosion in the air. The finds have yet to be chemically analysed so there is no proof that the rocks - named 'dental crown', 'whale' and 'boat' - are from outerspace. Even when tested they may not prove whether the explosion was caused by asteroid or comet because comets can contain fragments of rock. Previous explorations of the area have turned up other evidence such as tiny metallic spheres which could be shrapnel from the object and even a ground-penetrating radar view of a possible impact crater. Zlobin published his work on the website arXiv.org.","Scientists have been baffled by the Tunguska incident in 1908 .

Argentinian tourists have staged a British invasion, with record numbers flying in to the UK in the last year. The influx of more than 100,000 visitors – up more than a quarter year-on-year - comes despite renewed tensions between the two countries over the status of the Falkland Islands. Attempts by Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to stoke anti-British feeling have failed to stop her compatriots from spending a record £104million during holidays and business trips in 2012. Record: More than 100,000 visitors from Argentina travelled to the UK last year, spending more than £100million and staying for a total of 1.07million nights . War of words: The rise in visitors to Britain comes despite attempts by Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to lay claim to the Falklands, which have been rebuffed by David Cameron . President Kirchner was barred from the funeral of Baroness Thatcher last month after repeatedly laying claim to the South Atlantic islands which Britain defended during her premiership in 1982. David Cameron has responded to the threats by refusing to rule out using force to respect the outcome of a referendum of islanders in which all but three voters said they wanted to remain a UK overseas territory. But the war of words which has erupted after Mrs Kirchner re-election as the country’s President, only appears to have fuelled interest among Argentinians to holiday in the UK. In fact tourism bosses believe the influx of Argentine football stars into the UK Premier League, including Man City’s Carlos Tevez and Newcastle’s Fabricio Coloccini, has also helped to stimulate interest in holidaying in Britain. The number of visits from Argentina rose in 2012 by 27 per cent to 103,500, the highest year-on-year increase from anywhere in the world. Visitor numbers were also more than five times higher than in 2002, when just 19,000 arrived in the UK. And it was more than 25 times greater than the 4,000 visits made in 1983, the year after Lady Thatcher’s government liberated the Falklands, known to Argentina as Las Malvinas. Increase: The rise in the number of visits from Argentina was higher than from any other country, official figures show . Star attractions: Interest in Britain has been fuelled by Argentinian footballers players in the Premier League including Man City's Carlos Tevez (left) and Newcastle United's Fabricio Coloccini, tourism bosses claim . In 2012, Argentinians stayed in the UK for a total of 1.07million nights - an 84 per cent increase on 2011. Visitors from Argentina spent £101million, up from just £40million a year earlier. The visits included 22,000 more holidays in the UK, 2,000 extra business trips, 1,000 visiting students but the number of trips to visit friends and family fell by 2,000. David Leslie, spokesman for tourism agency VisitBritain, said: ‘2012 was a record year for visits and spend from Argentina, up 28 per cent from the previous year and accounting for nearly one-fifth of all visits from Central and South America. ‘We know that Britain’s contemporary culture and rich heritage is highly regarded, while many younger Argentinian visitors see London as a vibrant city and the fashion centre of Europe. ‘If you take a look around the Premier League you’ll also find some fantastic Argentinian players plying their trade, and with major events like the Rugby World Cup taking place here, we hope we’ll be able to give a warm welcome to an even greater number of Argentinians coming to experience the very best of what Britain has to offer.’ However, relations between the countries’ two leaders has been far from warm. Snub: Last year Mrs Kirchner tried to present Mr Cameron with a document laying claim to the Falklands, but he refused to accept it at a G20 Summit in Los Cabos . Earlier this year President Kirchner . used newspaper adverts to insist her nation was ‘forcibly stripped’ of . the Falklands in a ‘blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism’ – a . claim branded ‘crazy’ by Whitehall officials. In . an open letter to Mr Cameron, published as an advert in Left-wing . newspapers on the 180th anniversary of the alleged January 1833 . takeover, she accused the UK of defying United Nations resolutions by . refusing negotiations over the Falklands. But . in a strong message which risked angering Buenos Aires, Mr Cameron made . clear that he was ready to respond with force if threats to the islands . emerged. He insisted that . despite defence cuts, Britain would be able to defend the islands again, . as Lady Thatcher did in 1982 at a cost of more than 900 lives - 255 of . them British servicemen. Mrs . Kirchner attempted to thrust a package stuffed with documents about her . country’s claim to the British territory into Mr Cameron’s hands in an . encounter at a recent G20 summit. To . her fury, the Prime Minister repeatedly refused to accept it, insisting . she should respect the views of the islanders who want to remain . British. Leader: The funeral of Baroness Thatcher was dominated by troops from units which fought to reclaim the Falklands in 1982 . History: Steel helmets abandoned by Argentine armed forces who surrendered at Goose Green to British Falklands Task Force troops during the Falklands War . Official tourism figures for 2012 showed record numbers of visitors from several countries, including China and record spend by Australians and Canadians. But the 27 per cent increase in visitors from Argentina put it well ahead of other growth markets including Hungary (24 per cent), Egypt (23 per cent) and China (20 per cent). Tourism minister Hugh Robertson said: ‘The tourism industry plays a key part in selling a modern, welcoming and dynamic Britain abroad that helps contribute to economic growth and drive investment. ‘We had a huge boost last year with the Jubilee and hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Government remains committed to making sure we capitalise on it.’","103,500 visits from Argentina in 2012 - up 27% year-on-year .

A grieving mother is taking legal action after hospital staff branded her unborn son ‘lazy’ - when he actually suffering from a rare genetic condition that had paralysed his limbs. Lucy Copland, 27, was told by a sonographer that her baby did not move during scans simply because he was 'lazy'. But the distraught mother-of-three refused to accept that theory and demanded further tests - which finally revealed  her unborn son had a rare muscular and skeletal disorder that meant he could not move his arms or legs. He died just hours after birth several weeks later. Lucy Copland, 27, was concerned when her son was not kicking or moving during pregnancy. She repeatedly raised her concerns but was reassured by a sonographer that the baby was 'just a lazy boy'. Mrs Copland said: ‘It’s disgusting. They kept saying my baby was just a ""lazy boy"", when in fact he was seriously ill. The poor little mite wasn’t lazy. He couldn’t move because his limbs were fused solid. ‘I kept telling them something was wrong because I hadn’t felt any kicks at all, but they wouldn’t listen. As far as they were concerned he was just lazy and I was made to feel like a paranoid mum. ‘When we finally found out what was wrong with Alfie I felt devastated and let down that nobody had listened to me earlier. ‘I want justice for Alfie. No mother should go through that.’ Lucy was scanned 17 weeks into her pregnancy when she first raised concerns at Peterborough City Hospital last year. She explained: ‘I’d suffered a previous loss at 17 weeks so the scan was to offer assurance. 'They said I had a perfect little baby boy but I noticed he didn’t move at all during the scan and I thought it was odd.’ Lucy could not see movement when scans of baby Alfie (such as this one taken at 22 weeks) were carried out at hospital. It wasn't until 26 weeks in that doctors spotted a serious congenital disorder . At her 20-week scan became distressed again when she noticed the baby wasn't moving. ‘I kept asking why he wasn’t moving,' she recalled. 'He was like a statue on the screen. Alarm bells were ringing and I . started crying because I knew it wasn’t right. I became very . distressed. ‘That’s when the sonographer turned . around and told me not to worry because he was just a ‘lazy boy. I was . shocked. I knew that wasn’t right.’ Mrs Copland, from Crowland in Lincolnshire, . returned two weeks later for another scan where she again raised . concerns that her baby wasn't moving. She was once again assured he was . just 'lazy' and told to relax. ‘I couldn’t relax. I knew from my other pregnancies it wasn’t normal for him not to move at all and I begged someone to listen.' Lucy knew from previous pregnancies (from left to right her children Ellie-Mae, Rhys and Tayla) that it wasn't normal for babies not to move or kick. She said doctors dismissed her concerns and made her feel 'paranoid' But Mrs Copland said she was denied more scans. Over the following three weeks and five days she called the maternity unit 22 times, expressing concern that her baby still had not moved. ‘I felt like I was going mad. I knew something was wrong with my baby. It is not normal to get to 24 weeks pregnant and not feel your baby move,' said Ms Copland, who has three other children - Ellie-Mae,4, Rhys, 8, and Tayla, 6. ‘I was an emotional wreck and kept begging for another scan to look for movement, but I was told it would be of no benefit. ‘I even started to think perhaps I was paranoid.' Finally she was called in for another scan at 26 weeks and an emergency referral was made when medics agreed it was unusual that the tot still wasn’t moving. She was sent to experts at Nottingham Hospital the following day and it was quickly confirmed her son was suffering with severe birth abnormalities. Alfie was eventually diagnosed with fetal akinesia deformation sequence. He was delivered via C-section and died just hours later and before Lucy had regained consciousness. Her husband Ben (pictured) was forced to break the heartbreaking news to her . Mrs Copland said: ‘I’d been assured all along he was perfect whenever I had raised concerns,  but in fact he was so poorly every joint in his body was fused. 'That is why he had been so still. That is why I had not felt a movement or kick. He had never been lazy at all. Alfie died just five hours after birth . ‘I was utterly distraught and angry at the way I had been treated but my priority was my baby.’ She was advised to terminate the pregnancy when it was confirmed her son had the genetic condition Fetal akinesia deformation sequence. The condition causes the bones to fuse together and reduces lung function amongst other serious abnormalities. ‘It all happened so fast. If you’re told there is nothing wrong for that long and then suddenly advised to abort your baby your world collapses. ‘I refused because if there was a chance he could survive, no matter how disabled, then he deserved that.’ But tragically, just two weeks later, Mrs Copland s water’s went at 28 weeks and she was rushed into theatre for an emergency caesarian section on November 14th last year. Alfie lived for five hours but passed away before his mother woke from the operation. Her husband Ben, 27, cradled the newborn as he died and later had to break the heartbreaking news to his wife that he had died. She said: ‘I broke down when they brought him to me. I tried to dress him and his limbs were so rigid -  it was no wonder he had never moved or I had never felt a kick. I wanted to know how they could have missed it for so long. ‘I had repeatedly told them something was wrong with my baby. They should have listened. ‘ . Her son was buried next to the baby Lucy had lost at 17 weeks. She then set about seeking answers from the hospital. Peterborough City Hospital's general manager apologised for the blunder, saying that any comments made during Lucy's scan were intended to reassure her but that it was inappropriate that the sonographer suggested her baby was 'lazy' ‘I wanted to express what they had put me and my family through by ignoring my fears for so long.’ In a letter to the family, the general manager of the hospital explained the baby’s condition might have been missed because it only became noticeable in the later stages of pregnancy. Lucy is now looking for answers to the questions surrounding her pregnancy with Alfie . But Lucy disputes this: ‘I begged them to listen to me from 20 weeks but it was easier to dismiss me as paranoid.’ The letter from the general manager also apologised for this and said: ‘I apologise that you were made to feel that you were paranoid; this is unacceptable and the members of staff that you refer to in your letter have been seen … and their attitude and behaviour addressed.’ The letter went on : ‘Any comments made during the scan would have had the intention of reassurance. It was inappropriate that the sonographer suggested your baby was ""lazy"". This has been addressed with her.’ The hospital has also issued the following statement. Chris Wilkinson, director of care quality and chief nurse at Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'Firstly, the Trust would like to offer our most sincere condolences to the Copland family at this sad time. 'It is not appropriate to comment specifically about Lucy Copland’s experience, however the concerns of Mrs Copland were raised through the Trust’s formal complaints system. 'We have completed a full investigation followed by a meeting with the family to present our findings. 'The Trust will continue to offer its guidance to the family should they need any further advice.'","Lucy Copland, 27, from Lincolnshire, was worried when she noticed her baby didn't move during scans carried out at 17-weeks and after .

Overweight patients are switching doctors because they are uncomfortable with unwanted weight loss advice . Overweight patients are significantly more likely to engage in 'doctor shopping' - regularly switching doctors - than normal-sized patients, according to a new study. Off-putting weight loss advice and improperly sized medical equipment are thought to be the major reasons, say the . researchers, from the John Hopkins University in Baltimore. But constantly moving about means these . patients are a staggering 85 per cent more likely to end up in A&E, they say. The study of more than 20,000 patients showed that the odds of doctor shopping increased by 19 per cent for overweight patients and 37 per cent for obese patients, compared with normal-weight patients.. Four per cent of patients saw five or more primary care doctors over two years, a practice more likely in obese and overweight patients as well. Kimberly A. Gudzune, an . assistant professor in the division of general internal medicine at the . Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said: 'If you are dissatisfied with your care or feel judged because of your weight, then you may be better served by finding a provider who can meet your needs.' But the worry, she adds, is that some patients may not find a doctor they feel comfortable and are then driven to keep searching for new ones. She continued: 'There’s something going wrong in these doctor-patient relationships that make these switches so frequent for this group of people.' 'The real problem here is that the health of overweight and obese patients who doctor shop is being compromised. By switching doctors too regularly, overweight and obese patients are 85 per cent more likely to end up in A&E . 'Because they do not remain with their doctors for very long, they are ending up in the emergency room, likely for things that could have been taken care of in a primary care office.' 'If they feel judged or hear offhanded comments about their weight, if the blood pressure cuff won’t fit properly or they are afraid the examination table will not support their weight, it reinforces negative stereotypes obese patients encounter elsewhere.' 'We need to strive to create a safe, judgment-free environment where all patients can receive satisfying medical care.'

Nick Clegg was last night facing fresh pressure over his role in obtaining funding for a charity linked to his wife Miriam after the Liberal Democrat leader’s officials were ordered to hand over key emails to Britain’s data watchdog. The demand by Christopher Graham, the Information Commissioner, means the Cabinet Office will be forced to release to him a pile of private correspondence relating to the £12 million Government grant received by Booktrust last year. The Mail on Sunday revealed in December that the charity received the money after one of Mr Clegg’s aides lobbied for it. This meant the grant could be given direct – rather than having to compete with other charities. This newspaper then made a Freedom of Information request to the Government for the release of emails sent between officials relating to the deal. But this was blocked by the Cabinet Office on the grounds that their publication would ‘prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs’. It is understood that the emails show senior civil servants expressed concern about the way the bidding process had apparently been manipulated to benefit Booktrust, which gives away books to promote reading among children. Sources in Mr Clegg’s Cabinet Office have claimed the aide, Matt Sanders, had referred in conversation to the fact Miriam Clegg had hosted a lavish function for Booktrust weeks earlier. Mrs Clegg, who uses her professional name Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, hosted the event in October at one of London’s most grandiose venues, historic Lancaster House. At the charity’s 20th anniversary party, Spanish-born Mrs Clegg said she fell in love with Britain through reading Enid Blyton’s stories and was keen to encourage her three sons to read. She quoted Roald Dahl’s Oompa Loompa song, from Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, ‘So please, oh please, we beg, we pray, Go throw your TV set away, And in its place you can install, A lovely bookshelf on the wall.’ Lavish reception: As a prominent supporter of the charity, Miriam addressed Booktrust's 20th anniversary event in October . Now, after an appeal by The Mail on . Sunday to Mr Graham, a £140,000- a-year former BBC employee who . previously ran the Advertising Standards Authority, the Information . Commissioner said: ‘I have written to the Cabinet Office and asked it to . provide me with a copy of the [requested information] along with . detailed submissions to support its position that this information is . exempt from disclosure.’ Mr Clegg’s office maintains that the decision on Booktrust’s funding was taken ‘in an entirely proper way by the Secretary of State for Education’. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Booktrust, which has given away 40 million books to schoolchildren in the past 20 years.

Dramatic plans to bring forward a historic vote on Britain quitting the EU are being considered by David Cameron in a desperate effort to fend off the threat from UKIP. Under the policy shift, driven by new Tory strategy chief Lynton Crosby, the Prime Minister would scrap plans to hold the ‘in/out’ referendum in 2017 and instead stage the crucial vote a year earlier. The plans emerged amid dire warnings from senior Liberal Democrats that the referendum row was ‘tearing the Coalition apart’ and could result in an early General Election. David Cameron (left) could bring forward the crucial vote by a year under the plans in an effort to fend off the threat from UKIP . In the Commons this week, up to 100 Tory MPs are set to take the extraordinary step of condemning their own Government’s Queen’s Speech for failing to enshrine Mr Cameron’s referendum promise in law. The Prime Minister is likely to be out of the country for the vote but No 10 sources indicated last night that Tory Ministers will be ‘guided’ to abstain – to the fury of their Lib Dem Coalition partners. It raises the highly unusual prospect of Conservative Cabinet Ministers deciding to sit on their hands in implicit criticism of a programme of legislation they helped to draft. The Prime Minister is said to be ‘relaxed’ and happy to give backbench MPs a free vote on the issue. But former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell claimed that it was ‘madness’ to consider quitting the EU. He also warned that if the Coalition collapsed ‘in a flurry of dissent and bad temper’, it would be difficult to see his party co-operating with the Tories in any future pact. Sir Menzies told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If it ends with the parties at each other’s throats, that would be meat and drink to Labour and UKIP. ‘If this experiment in Coalition ends in mutual recriminations, the chances of a similar arrangement in the future will be greatly reduced.’ Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell claimed that it was 'madness' to consider quitting the EU . One senior Downing Street source claims that Mr Crosby has warned Mr Cameron that 2017 is too far away to have any real electoral impact – and that the Prime Minister must stress that he would back an ‘out’  vote if he failed to negotiate  an acceptable new settlement with Brussels. Mr Crosby has reportedly advised that the next Tory manifesto should contain a pledge to hold a vote by 2016 so that the party can promise the public’s ‘voice will be heard’ within a year of the poll. Another source claimed that Mr Cameron’s referendum pledge in January had been rushed out after he was mistakenly informed that Ed Miliband was poised to beat him to it. The source said a Tory MP reported back to No 10 in early December that he had overheard Tom Baldwin – a key aide to the Labour leader – speaking loudly on a mobile phone in the Commons about ‘beating Cameron to the punch’ by promising a referendum first. ‘As a result we have needlessly backed ourselves into a corner,’ the source added. Mr Baldwin last night denied ever advocating such a tactic. Yesterday, Mr Miliband ruled out making such a pledge and accused the Tories of plunging the country into years of uncertainty over EU membership. Last night, Downing Street insisted there were no current plans to bring forward the date of a referendum.","Policy shift driven by new Tory strategy chief Lynton Crosby .

If you've settled down with Mr Right, be warned – there’s something in your bathroom cabinet that could make you take him for granted. Research suggests that taking the contraceptive Pill makes women less competitive with each other, meaning they are less likely to fight to keep their ideal man. As researchers said women should be made aware that the Pill can have psychological, as well as physical, side-effects, other experts urged women not to throw away their supplies. The study by team of researchers in the Netherlands found the contraceptive pill can make women less competitive . The team from the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, studied a group of young women when they were taking the Pill and when they came off it. On each occasion the volunteers, who were . aged between 20 and 31, filled in questionnaires designed to measure . intra-sexual competition – or whether they viewed other women as friends . or foes. They found that women in a relationship were less competitive when they were on the Pill, making them less likely to fight to keep their partner if another woman comes along to turn his head. They believe this is because the oral contraceptive, taken by millions, suppresses testosterone, a hormone that fuels rivalry in both sexes. Among single women, they believe the desire to meet a mate could override the hormonal influence of the Pill. Dr Allan Pacey, a fertility expert at Sheffield University, said the ‘intriguing’ study warranted further research. But he added: ‘I don’t think there’s sufficient evidence for doctors to start issuing a health warning to women.’ However some experts have questioned the study and said women should not throw away their supplies . Writing in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, Researcher Kelly Cobey said: ‘If hormonal contraceptive use reduces a natural propensity for partnered women to compete for mates it may mean that many women in our contemporary population, where hormonal contraceptive use is widespread, have a reduced ability to attract new mates or to maintain their existing partner. ‘In light of our findings, women using hormonal contraceptives may be at a disadvantage in that they are less likely to seek out or switch to a new partner from whom they might acquire additional benefits. ‘Women who use hormonal contraceptives may settle and start families with partners who they otherwise would not.’ However, other experts questioned her interpretation of her results – and pointed out some highly competitive women like to take the pill because it frees them from pre-menstrual tension and other problems that can hold them back.","Researchers said women should be made aware of psychological as well as physical side effects .

Nigel Evans, the Deputy Commons Speaker was arrested at the weekend over rape and sexual assault allegations . Police launched their rape investigation into Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans as a result of the actions of a fellow Conservative MP, it can be revealed. The MP accompanied one of the alleged victims to a police station while he made the allegations that triggered Mr Evans’s bombshell arrest last weekend. Last night the MP, whose identity is being withheld by The Mail on Sunday, said: ‘It is important for legal reasons that I make absolutely no comment.’ The revelation that Mr Evans’s arrest was caused by one of his own party colleagues will add to the sense of shock that the incident has caused at Westminster. It is also likely to intensify behind-the-scenes debate over whether the Ribble Valley MP should continue to carry out his Commons duties while detectives investigate. Mr Evans says the allegations  that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another, over a period  dating from 2009 to last month, are ‘completely false’. He has not been charged with any offences and has been bailed until June 19. Last week, after what he described as the ‘worst two days of my life’, the Deputy Speaker returned to the Commons, where he was greeted warmly and publicly by colleagues on both sides of the House. He has temporarily stepped aside from his official duties, but says that he intends to return to the chair of the chamber once the debates on the Queen’s Speech are over. Nigel Evans gave a statement at his home in Pendleton Lancashire, where he said that allegations he raped one man and sexually assaulted another are 'completely false' However, some MPs are privately advising . Speaker John Bercow that Mr Evans should step down  completely while he . fights to clear his name. Most Tory MPs support him staying in the . chair, while a majority of Labour MPs are opposed. The  Liberal . Democrats are ‘hopelessly divided’ on the matter, a source said. Lancashire Police has deployed ten officers on the investigation, . called Operation Corsica, and has been in contact with the Serjeant at . Arms – the official in charge of Commons security – about  the . parliamentary procedure to  follow if officers decide to search Mr . Evans’s office. Evans has temporarily stepped aside from his official duties . The force is treading carefully in the aftermath of the row five years ago when the then Serjeant, Jill Pay, granted consent for police to search the Westminster office of Conservative frontbencher Damian Green without a warrant as part of an investigation into Home  Office leaks. No charges were ever brought, and Pay said that she ‘deeply regretted’ accepting a police request to keep the operation secret. Mr Evans has confirmed that in 2009 he was interviewed by the then Tory Chief Hhip Patrick McLoughlin over allegedly making an unwanted advance to a man he was drinking with, but has said that it was a ‘misreading of  signals’. Much of the attention following Mr Evans’s arrest has focused on a striking red mark running down his forehead. He has said it was the result of a massage for a tension headache. The Soho parlour Mr Evans visited confirmed that it offered tension headache treatment, but insisted that its masseur could not have inflicted the mark.

She has battled breast cancer for five years and has now been hit with the devastating news it has spread to her spine. Mel Smye, 31, has battled breast cancer for five years and it has now spread to her spine. Her 11-year-old daughter Kate, 11, has written a list of things she wants them to do together . Kate's heart-breaking list, which includes a girly shopping trip, seeing a show in London and visiting Legoland, has sparked a flood of donations to help the dreams come true . Things I would like to save up for to do with my mum and brother while she is still well enough. Legoland or Thorpe Park. To see 1D [One Direction] or anyone really as we’ve never been to a concert before and always say we will. To have a girly shopping day with mum at Glasgow. To save up enough for my big dream would be to save enough to go to Disneyland Paris or to take my mum to see a show in London to have the experience I did with my school as she always wanted to go, but any of these would be good memories for us all :-) By Kate Smye . Age 11 . But Kate is determined to brighten her mother's last days, filling them with trips they can do along with her 15-year-old brother. The bucket list includes going to Legoland and seeing the boy band One Direction 'or anyone really, as we've never been to a concert before'. Kate also hopes to save up enough to take her mum to a show in London as it's something she has always wanted to do. Mel had kept details of her illness between family and friends up until now but she made the decision to publicise her condition to help build memories for her two children which they can cherish forever. Since Kate’s bucket list was launched on Facebook two weeks ago, offers of cash and help have flooded in from the community to help make the family’s dreams come true. Mel, who works at Center Parcs, Penrith, Cumbria, said: 'It’s overwhelming what Kate’s doing. She’s only just turned 11, but she’s very mature for her age. Kate (centre), pictured at a fundraising event, has raised over £2,700 towards the bucket list . 'Because of what we’ve been through in the last five years she’s grown up quicker than normal children. She’s just amazing. She’s a very special little girl. 'Both of my children are amazing and fantastic.' The idea for the list came as the family talked about how to make the time they have left together as special as possible. Kate is determined to brighten her mother's last days, filling them with trips they can do along with 15-year-old brother Jake . When they had written down some aims, Mel, who is undergoing monthly bone infusions and having regular radium therapy to control her pain, said that they would have to start saving. She said: 'Kate doesn’t ask for a lot, we were not going to do anything extreme - just something we could work towards.' But when the single mother told a close friend of her plan, she was hit with the stark reality that she wouldn’t be able to afford a lot of the ideas. So the family, along with Mel’s friends, made the decision to launch Kate’s Bucket List and have so far raised £2,700. They are organising a trip to London and Legoland and have been offered a villa in Florida for three weeks next February. Mel said: ""I’m fully aware there are a lot of other people out there in my situation. 'It’s very overwhelming and I’m very humbled by everything that is being done. Things are still raw but we’re not focusing on them. 'This has been a very positive thing for us to do.' The family have also been given tickets to watch McFly at the Whitehaven Festival and will be taken to the concert in a limousine. Fundraising events planned include an afternoon tea at Whitehaven’s Marchon Club, a coast-to-coast cycle ride, raffles and a bingo night.

The row over the cost of police and crime commissioners deepened last night after it emerged that one of the new  PCCs has spent nearly £17,000 decorating his office. Essex commissioner Nick Alston used taxpayers’ money to spruce up his office after being elected as the Conservative candidate last November. The bill included more than £10,000 on ‘wall coverings’. The disclosure comes amid mounting disquiet over the cost of PCCs. Figures last week showed that more than a third are already costing the public more than the police authorities they replaced. The new commissioners were elected to hold ‘police forces to account’ across England and Wales, with the power to hire and sack chief constables and set police budgets. Just 15 per cent of the public voted in the elections. Now it has emerged that Mr Alston, who campaigned for his £85,000-a-year post by declaring how everyone was ‘feeling the pinch’ and that the PCC would ‘have to make some tough choices’, has admitted spending £16,952 on ‘furnishing and redecorating’ his new office – including £2,482 on the kitchen. Matthew Sinclair, head of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘PCCs are there to keep a watchful eye on police spending, not to create their own empires. ‘Commissioners must keep their own costs . down if they are to have the moral authority to hold the police to . account over spending.’ Fury: Mr Alston spent thousands of pounds sprucing his office. Pictured is Essex Police HQ in Chelmsford, Essex . Careful: Taxpayer's Alliance say that Mr Alston must curb his own spending if he is to hold the police to account over money . Last night, a spokesman for Mr Alston said the cost included decorating four offices and a conference room, as well as ‘removing the coffee machine and relocating the water chiller’. He said: ‘This was necessary to free up space to accommodate the commissioner and his deputy.’ Earlier this year it emerged that Cumbria commissioner Richard Rhodes had made chauffeur-driven journeys at a cost of more than £300 per trip. PPCs have also been accused of ‘cronyism’ over the appointment of deputies on salaries of £70,000.","Essex commissioner Nick Alston used £17,000 of taxpayer's money .

Legal battle: Former Broadmoor manager Stephen Rooney (pictured) is suing the top-security hospital for unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal where it was claimed the Kempton Ward was being run like a social club . A hospital ward holding the most dangerous killers and rapists in Britain was run like a 'social club' with men giving one another back waxes on a pool table, an employment tribunal heard today. While staff at the all-male Broadmoor top-security hospital watched television, at least one patient was enjoying a sexual relationship with a woman therapist, it was claimed, leading to another offender asking to be given an HIV test. Details of the 'permissive' regime on the Kempton Ward - home to patients with Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) - were revealed at the employment tribunal where an ex-manager is suing for unfair dismissal. Stephen Rooney launched his claim against the NHS trust governing Broadmoor after he was suspended for allegedly covering up details of the patient's request for the HIV test to reassure himself he was not at risk of AIDS. Mr Rooney then resigned from the trust rather than take the new post, prompting his claim for unfair dismissal. The 47-year-old former clinical nurse manager is claiming unfair dismissal against the West London Mental Health NHS Trust. Mr Rooney alleges he lost his . £40,000-a-year post in September 2011 following a disciplinary . investigation into claims he withheld information about the patient . apparently requesting an HIV test. Giving evidence at the tribunal, Mr Rooney also criticised what he called a 'dysfunctional' communication at Broadmoor. Among the patients being treated at Broadmoor are Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, Stockwell Strangler Kenneth Erskine and cannibal killer Peter Bryan. Referring to events on Kempton Ward, where Mr Rooney was based, Nadia Motraghi, representing the NHS trust, said: 'There was at least one occasion where a patient was waxing another's back while on the pool table. 'That's a very serious issue, isn't it?' Mr Rooney replied: 'Yes it is.' He told the tribunal the incident had occurred while he was on leave but he had learned of it upon his return. 'I managed to ascertain how this patient got the wax strips and who authorised it,' said Mr Rooney. 'It was being treated as a serious . incident, a complete lack of boundary-keeping by staff. Unfortunately I . was suspended during the midst of that.' Mr Rooney said he had 'never' previously encountered a similar scenario and added: 'The wax strips . apparently were bought as part of a patient raffle, from what I am led . to believe post-suspension.' Claims: The hearing was told that while staff watched television, at least one patient was enjoying a sexual relationship with a woman therapist, leading to another offender asking to be given an HIV test . Miss Motraghi told him: 'I'm going to . suggest there was an overly permissive environment where rules were . being relaxed to the point that patients were not subject to strict . scrutiny and there was a blurring of the boundary between staff and . patients.' She went on to refer to an incident . where Mr Rooney had described to a colleague witnessing members of his . staff watching television for a long period during a shift. 'I was very, very hot on getting the . staff to interact with the patients by getting them to understand why . [it was important to do so],' said Mr Rooney. 'Going in there and barking at them to break out the board games doesn't work.' Miss Motraghi also claimed staff would . regularly be heard swearing in the presence of patients, asking Mr . Rooney: 'It contributes to a pub/social club type of atmosphere, doesn't . it?' He replied: 'It could do, yes.' Allegations: Mr Rooney claims he lost his £40,000-a-year post in September 2011 following a disciplinary investigation into claims he withheld information about a patient who apparently requested an HIV test . Mr Rooney joined the staff at . top-security Broadmoor in October 1993, working initially as a nursing . assistant and then a staff nurse before rising through the ranks to . become a clinical nurse manager in 2007, working on the Kempton Ward as . part of the DSPD service. He was seconded to the position of . senior clinical manager for seven months in late 2009, returning to his . position on the ward at the end of May 2010. The tribunal judge made an order that . neither Patient 1 or Patient 2 should be named, along with the woman . therapist, referred to as E1. He told the tribunal in Reading, Berkshire: 'Shortly after [my] return to Kempton Ward, concerns were being raised regarding a patient's behaviour (Patient 1) towards a therapy assistant, E1. 'The team observed, discussed and planned strategies to address this behaviour and to support this member of staff.' The tribunal heard Mr Rooney had trouble recalling events claiming he was suffering from extreme anxiety and stress at the time. The hearing continues.","Details of Kempton Ward regime revealed in unfair dismissal tribunal brought by ex-manager Stephen Rooney .

Attorneys for Michael Jackson's family on Monday accused his concert promoter, AEG, of ignoring 'red flags' about his drug addiction and ill health in a ruthless pursuit of profits. AEG Live is the second-largest concert promoter in the nation and Jackson family lawyer Brian Panish told jurors that the company's only priority was overtaking its competition, Live Nation. 'They wanted to be No. 1 at all costs,' he said. Monday marked the beginning the trial for a wrongful death suit brought by the Kind of Pop's mother, Katherine Jackson, who claims AEG executives ordered Dr Conrad Murray to heavily medicate Jackson to ensure he continued to perform, despite pain and injury. The wrongful-death suit contends the . entertainment firm threatened to end Jackson’s career if he failed to . come through with the concerts and ordered Murray to keep the performer . on track. AEG officials have denied any . wrongdoing, and the company's lawyers have said executives could not have . foreseen the circumstances that led to the physician giving Jackson doses . of the anesthetic propofol as a sleep aid. Arrivals: Rebbie Jackson, left, and Randy Jackson attend the Jackson vs AEG court case on April 29, 2013 in Los Angeles, California . Former Michael Jackson lead attorney: Thomas A. Mesereau arrives for the opening arguments in Katherine Jackson's civil suit against concert promoter AEG . Doomed: The emails between executives from entertainment giant AEG are believed to reveal Michael Jackson's declining health ahead of his doomed This Is It comeback tour . 'Forget about helping Mr' Jackson,' Panish said. 'The show must go on.' AEG's attorney Marvin S. Putnam, however, said the singer's guarded private life meant the company was unaware that he was using powerful drugs. 'The truth is, Michael Jackson fooled everyone,' Putnam said. 'He made sure that no one, nobody, knew his deepest darkest secrets.' Panish said that AEG is the only . entity that claims it didn’t know about Jackson’s addiction to . prescription drugs. The addiction began, Panish says, following an infamous 1984 accident the filming of a Pepsi commercial that set Jackson's hair on fire. The singer suffered second and third burns and never fully recovered. First day: The Jackson family is seeking $40 billion in damages for the wrongful death of Michael Jackson from entertainment corporation AEG Live . Family: Jackson's mother, brother Randy and sister Rebbie, pictured, sat in the front row of the courtroom as Brian Panish detailed aspects of Jackson's life . Stating his case: Jackson attorney Brian Panish painted AEG Live as a greedy, ruthless company during his opening statements on Monday . Tears: Katherine Jackson, the pop star's mother, wept in court as lawyers played a song her son wrote for his three children . A jury of six men and six women will determine whether AEG is liable and any damages award. AEG Live, the second-largest concert promoter in the world, owed a duty to . properly investigate the doctor who treated Michael Jackson, Panish argued. 'His stirring voice, his musical . genius, his creativity and his generosity and his huge heart was . extinguished forever,' he told jurors. Katherine Jackson is suing AEG . claiming it failed to properly investigate the doctor convicted of . involuntary manslaughter over Jackson’s death. Suit: Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson is one of the family members who have brought the suit against AEG . Children: Damages are also being sought on behalf of the star's children Prince (left) Blanket (middle) and Paris (right) 'You’re going to hear the whole story about what happened in the death of Michael Jackson,' Panish said. Panish made his remarks in an opening . presentation filled with slides detailing the case against AEG, which . was promoting Jackson’s planned comeback tour, This Is It. Jackson’s mother, brother Randy and . sister Rebbie sat in the front row of the courtroom as Panish detailed . aspects of Jackson’s life. Millions, and possibly billions, of dollars are at stake. Katherine Jackson sued the company in . September 2010, claiming it failed to properly investigate former . physician Conrad Murray before allowing him to serve as Jackson’s tour . doctor. She is also suing on behalf of her son’s three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket. AEG denies it hired Murray, saying he was hired by Jackson himself. The company's lawyer have said they could not have foreseen the circumstances that . led to Jackson’s death at age 50. This Jackson trial has become a media spectacle, just like all of the previous court cases involving the King of Pop . A jury convicted Murray of giving . Jackson a fatal dose of the anesthetic propofol in 2011. The . hospital-grade anesthetic was being administered as a sleep aid. Panish told jurors they would be putting together a puzzle, with three pieces being Jackson, Murray and AEG Live. He told the panel that Jackson . suffered from addiction to prescription medications and Demerol at times . during his life, and the problem increased when he was keeping up a . rigorous schedule. 'Over the years Michael family’s and . people who knew him believed he had a problem with prescription . medication,' Panish told jurors. The lawyer showed a brief clip of . Jackson rehearing for the This Is It shows and a clip of the singer . dancing in the early stages of his presentation. He also showed footage of a 1999 show . in Munich in which Jackson was performing when a bridge dropped 50 feet . with the singer on it. Despite pain, Jackson continued performing, . Panish said. Panish said Jackson turned to Demerol to relieve his pain. Katherine Jackson and her two oldest grandchildren, Prince and Paris, are listed as possible witnesses. An AEG attorney said on Monday that the company intends to call Murray as a witness in the case as well. Murray did not testify at his criminal trial and his lawyers said he will invoke the Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination if called to testify in this case. Panish told jurors they would have to determine who was responsible for Jackson’s death. 'Michael paid the ultimate price. He died,' Panish said. 'Michael has taken responsibility.' Evidence: The star's former wives Lisa Marie Presley (left) and Debbie Rowe could be asked to give testimony during the trial . Jailed: Dr Conrad Murray wwas jailed for four years for causing involuntary manslaughter for his role in Michael Jackson's death . Hundreds of private emails detailing . Michael Jackson’s dramatic deterioration in his final days will play a . key role in the trial. The messages sent by executives at . AEG, the US entertainment giant behind the star’s doomed comeback tour, . reveal the 50-year-old singer’s turmoil as he struggled with his health . and inner demons to prepare for the lucrative concerts. According to a senior AEG lawyer, the company is likely to bring up Jackson’s drug shopping as well as his acquittal on child molestation charges as part of their case that the promoter had no liability in the tragedy. The Jackson family's lawyers are likely to zero in on the emails they claim show how aware the company’s senior executives were of the singer's fragile state. Stars: Singer Diana Ross is one of a number of celebrities who could be asked to give evidence during the court case . When Randy Phillips, a promoter at AEG, . went to Jackson’s London hotel suite the day before the singer announced . his comeback concerts he found him so drunk that he had to dress him. ‘MJ is locked in his room drunk and despondent. I [am] trying to sober him up,’ Phillips wrote to the company’s president Tim Leiweke. In the US where Mr Leiweke had just woken up, he replied: ‘Are you kidding me?’ ‘I screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking. He is an emotionally paralysed mess riddled with self loathing and doubt now that it is show time,' Mr Phillips responded. By June that year the alarm bells were ringing and a production manager wrote that Jackson was a ‘basket case'. The show’s director, Kenny Ortega, who had known Jackson for two decades, called for him to be evaluated by a psychiatrist. He also said the star would have to lip synch some of his songs because he was racked by ‘paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behaviour’. After Jackson's, Mr Phillips wrote in August 2009: ‘Michael’s death is a terrible tragedy, but life must go on. AEG will make a fortune from merch sales, ticket retention, the touring exhibition and the film/dvd.’ AEG would go on to earn about £160 million from the documentary film This Is It, which featured rehearsal footage. Lawyers representing the company will claim that Murray was hired by Jackson and not by the promoter. The civil trial jury took more than three weeks to select. The Jacksons are seeking a judgment against AEG equal to the money he would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime had he not died in 2009, plus exorbitant damages.","Firm was behind Michael Jackson's doomed comeback tour .

About 1,000 protesters chanted 'Muslim killers off our streets' and 'There's only one Lee Rigby' in tribute to the soldier killed in Woolwich, south-east London, last week. A massive police presence kept them apart from a smaller group of anti-fascist activists, with officers making 13 arrests in total. Four men have been charged with various offences after 1,000 English Defence League supporters (above) staged a protest near Downing Street. No one in the picture was arrested . Simon Morris, 45, of The Drive, Brent Cross in north-west London and Christopher Mee, 24, of Bradwell Avenue, Romford in Essex, were arrested in Leicester Square and charged under Section 4 of the Public Order Act. Nicholas McGee, 20, of Misbourne Road, Uxbridge in west London was also arrested in Leicester Square and charged with possession of class A drugs. Anthony Drury, 48, of no fixed abode, was arrested in Whitehall and charged with possession of a bladed article.

'America is to blame': President Ramzan Kadyrov, a former Chechen rebel himself, said 'any attempt to draw a connection' between Chechnya and the brothers was 'futile' Chechnya's Russian-backed president has hit out at America for killing one of the suspected Boston Marathon bombers and blamed the US for moulding them into terrorists. Chechen-born Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died from gunshot wounds and possible blast injuries after a fierce gun battle rocked the Watertown area of Boston hours after a police officer was shot dead at the nearby MIT . campus. His 19-year-old brother, Dzhokha, fled the shoot out and is on the run, reportedly having strapped explosives to his body. But President Ramzan Kadyrov, a former Chechen rebel himself, told US authorities that 'any attempt to draw a connection' between Chechnya and the brothers was 'futile'. In a Russian-language statement on Instagram, he added: 'They were raised in the United States, and their attitudes and beliefs were formed there. 'It is necessary to seek the roots of this evil in America. 'The whole world must struggle against terrorism — that we know better than anyone else. We hope for the recovery of all the victims, and we mourn with the Americans.' Muslim militants from Chechnya have a long history of unleashing devastating terror attacks on Russia – but the allegations of involvement in the Boston Marathon blasts would mark the first time they have targeted the West. However, the United States may have become a target for Chechen terrorists in the wake of the harrowing Beslan school hostage crisis nearly ten years ago, an expert claimed today. The world watched in horror in 2004 as armed Islamic separatist militants, some Chechen, occupied a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, and killed more than 380 people. Scroll down for video . Terrorists: Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left), killed by police on Wednesday night, and his younger brother Dzhokhar (right), who is still on the run, are both from the troubled region of Chechnya . Security expert Simon Bennett said the tragedy bridged a gap between the US and Russia by establishing a mutual threat - fundamental Islamic terrorism. Dr Bennett, director of the Civil Safety and Security Unit at the University of Leicester, said: 'One of the few things in the past five or 10 years that has brought the Russians and the US closer together is the perceived threat from Islamic terrorism.' He explained that the Beslan crisis would have fostered a close collaboration between the Russians and the West through agencies such as the CIA. Terror: Russian TV showed children and teachers cowering in fear in the gymnasium of the Beslan school as armed Chechen gunmen stand guard during the siege in 2004 . Fear: A gunman wires a bomb during the siege, images of which were beamed around the world. An expert today said the tragedy - which left 380 people dead - bridged a gap between the US and Russia by establishing a mutual threat - fundamental Islamic terrorism . Blood on the floor: This tape was made by hostage takers showing what seemed to be the first hours of the three day school crisis that ended in bloodshed . Dr Bennett went on: 'The Chechnyans and fundamentalists would have been aware of the bridging of the gap between Russia and the US. 'If Chechnya want an easy target, why not fly to the US on a temporary visa and attack a prestige event. 'If those two guys had carried out that attack in Moscow, the repercussions would have been severe because the Russian state under (president Vladimir) Putin is not reluctant to go in hard. They would know that wouldn't happen in America.' Buried in the heart of Russia’s Northern Caucasus, the Islamic state has fought against Russian rule for centuries. Bloodshed: Russian special forces remove hostages from a theatre where over 40, mostly female, Chechen terrorists took more than 700 hostages prisoner at a Moscow theatre . Bodies in the dark: And in January 2011, a Chechen suicide bomber unleashed terror on Moscow's Domodedovo Airport when they blew themselves up killing 36 people . But it culminated in a bloody and chaotic civil war with the Russian government that ended in 1994 and left tens of thousands dead and the region in ruins. As a result, the area became a hotbed for extremism, and was soon infiltrated by foreign Islamic militants, including those with ties to al Qaeda. Terrorists have since unleashed a string of attacks on Russian soil. While exact numbers are unclear, a small, but growing Chechen community exists in the United States, in particular in Los Angeles and throughout California. US intelligence has suggested drug trafficking has long financed the Chechen separatist movement and its links to Islamists groups. Meanwhile Chechen crime lords have increased their presence in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia to facilitate the shipping of Andean cocaine to Europe. They have also been linked to arms trafficking to Brazil and Colombia, and money laundering. Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya . in 1996 after the first Chechen war, leaving it de-facto independent . and largely lawless, but then rolled back three years later following . apartment building explosions in Moscow and other cities blamed on the . rebels. Chechnya has . stabilized under the steely grip of Kremlin-backed local strongman . Ramzan Kadyrov, a former rebel whose forces were accused of massive . rights abuses. But the Islamic insurgency has spread to neighboring provinces, with Dagestan, sandwiched between Chechnya and the Caspian Sea, becoming the epicenter of violence with militants launching daily attacks against police and other authorities. Militants from Chechnya and neighboring provinces have launched a long series of terror attacks in Russia . On October 23 2002, over 40, mostly female, terrorists took more than 700 hostages prisoner at a Moscow theatre, demanding an end to the Russian presence in Chechnya. Dressed from head to toe in black hijabs, they became known as The Black Widows. But Russian security forces stormed the theatre, guns blazing, killing the hostage takers after releasing a toxic gas into the auditorium that killed more than 100 innocent theatre goers. The 'Black Widows' responded by attempting to detonate homemade bombs strapped to their bodies, though most were shot dead before they could. Then on September 1 2004, a group of 32 heavily-armed, masked men seized control of Middle School Number One and more than 1,000 hostages in Beslan, North Ossetia. Most of the hostages were children aged from six to sixteen years old. Bombings: Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya in 1996 after the first Chechen war, leaving it de-facto independent and largely lawless, but then rolled back three years later following apartment building explosions in Moscow and other cities blamed on the rebels, such as this one in 1999 . Fight for independence: Buried in the heart of Russia¿s Northern Caucasus, the Islamic state has fought against Russian rule for centuries . After a tense two-day standoff, that was beamed around the world, Russian forces raided the building. Following a violent, two-hour gunfight, the siege ended, leaving 331 civilians, 11 commandos and 31 hostage-takers dead. The rebels have since claimed responsibility . for an array of terrorist attacks, including last year's double suicide . bombing of the Moscow subway system that killed 40 people. In March 2010, two women suicide bombers killed 40 commuters when they blew themselves up on two packed tube trains . during the busy rush hour. And in January a year later, a Chechen suicide bomber unleashed terror on Moscow's Domodedovo Airport when they blew themselves up killing 36 people. In recent years, however, militants in Chechnya, Dagestan . and other neighboring provinces have largely refrained from attacks outside the . Caucasus. The allegations of the Caucasus men's role in the Boston's . explosions would reinforce long-held claims by Russian officials that . insurgents in the Caucasus have been linked to al-Qaida.","Suspects may have attacked US because of its relationship with Russia .

Two small planes collided and then crashed in the desert on Friday, killing all four people aboard the two aircraft, officials said. Phoenix and Daisy Mountain Fire Department officials said the collision and crash involved two single-engine planes with two people in each aircraft. Officials said the crash occurred around 10 a.m. in far north Phoenix, some 15 miles northwest of Deer Valley Airport. Plane collision: Both planes involved in the crash grounded in the desert north of Phoenix . One of the planes was registered to Bird Acquisition LLC, which does business as TransPac Aviation Academy, a school for commercial pilots in north Phoenix. TransPac issued a statement Friday afternoon that said two of its instructors died in the crash. The business said it wasn't immediately releasing the names of the two men or any personal information about them 'out of respect for the families during this time of sadness and grieving.' The plane that burned reportedly was registered to an aircraft leasing company that has an office at Deer Valley Airport. Several bystanders reported seeing the Cessna and Piper collide but the flight directions of the planes before the crash or other details weren't immediately available, authorities said. 'Both of them collided. We don't know how or what,' said Phoenix Fire Department Capt. Larry Nunez. 'The skies are clear.' An initial report said three people were killed and two people were injured. Fire officials with the Phoenix and Peoria city fire departments and Daisy Mountain Fire Department later said four people had died and there were no survivors. Television news footage showed only charred wreckage left from one of the planes, while the other was fairly intact. No survivors: All four adults in the two planes were killed, including two flight instructors . Fiery blaze: One plane crashed relatively intact, while firefighters had to hose down the completely demolished second plane . Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA will investigate. Gregor said federal investigators were en route to the crash scene Friday afternoon, but it typically takes several months for the NTSB investigation to determine a probable cause for air accidents.","Two flight instructors among the four adults who were killed in the crash .

Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell is demanding an apology from Theresa May after privately accusing the Home Secretary of masterminding his exit from Government over ‘Plebgate’. He is convinced he lost his job last autumn because of a police conspiracy – and that Mrs May was instrumental  in turning the Cabinet against him when his fate hung in  the balance. And he also believes she let her view that his position had become untenable become known to the media. Former Chief whip Andrew Mitchell (right) wants a personal apology from Theresa May (left) because he believes she turned Cabinet members against him during the 'Plebgate' row . Mr Mitchell has admitted swearing when asked to take his bicycle through a side gate at Downing Street last September, but has always insisted police fabricated claims that he called them ‘f****** plebs’. He resigned in October after a police log, which appeared to corroborate the officers’ account, was leaked. Scotland Yard is investigating his claim that the allegations were concocted. Preliminary findings are expected to be released within days. Mr Mitchell wants Mrs May to personally apologise for ‘prejudging’ him. He believes she told colleagues he should not remain in his job because his continued presence was damaging the Government. He claims to have proof she briefed journalists to that effect. When Mrs May was asked at the time whether she had been in the ‘vanguard’ of efforts to force him to step down, she said: ‘I’m not going to talk about private conversations.’ A friend of Mr Mitchell said last night: ‘There are many at Westminster who feel it would be nice if those who got it so wrong were to acknowledge that.’ A spokeswoman for Mrs May declined to comment. Mr Mitchell, who is supported by powerful figures including former party leader Michael Howard and ex-Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, is confident a prosecution review of evidence gathered by Operation Alice, the Scotland Yard investigation into claims of police fabrication, will back his version of events. Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell is confident a prosecution review of the evidence in the 'Plebgate' row will back his version of events . A Channel 4 investigation cast doubt on the initial police account when it revealed that CCTV footage showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the gate during the row, as was originally claimed. And an email supposedly from a witness backing up the police account of events has also been called into question. Earlier this month The Mail on Sunday disclosed that Mr Mitchell had written to Deborah Glass, deputy chairman  of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, to accuse police of a sustained ‘dishonest and illicit’ campaign to destroy him, including the leaking of information to the press that suggested the inquiry would dismiss his claims. It will be announced tomorrow that Mr Mitchell, a former International Development Secretary, will join the board of a charity that aims to build on the legacy of the London Olympics. International Inspiration, chaired by Lord Coe, uses sporting ambassadors, including Tanni Grey-Thompson and Chris Hoy, to help 15 million disadvantaged children around the world.","Former Chief Whip thinks Home Secretary turned Cabinet against him .

Nigel Farage is mounting a drive to recruit UKIP supporters from ‘white, working-class’ Labour voters who feel abandoned by Ed Miliband’s party. The UKIP leader – whose surge in the opinion polls has been put down to defections by disenchanted Conservative supporters – will unveil his new strategy in a party political broadcast next Sunday. The film will show his deputy, Paul Nuttall, touring Labour’s inner-city heartlands asking locals if they  agree with UKIP policies such as withdrawing from the European Union – and being given an enthusiastic reception. Drive: UKIP leader Nigel Farageis mounting a drive to recruit UKIP supporters from 'white, working-class' Labour voters who feel abandoned by Ed Miliband's party . Mr Farage’s strategists say the  traditional dividing lines between the parties are becoming blurred, with Labour supporters just as likely to sympathise with the call for tighter restrictions on immigration. Although the broadcast, to be shown on Channel 4, was filmed on Monday, two days before the Woolwich murder, it will revive the debate about the political impact of the social tensions that can exist in some urban areas where growing ethnic minority communities co-exist with long- established populations of white  British locals. Following UKIP’s dramatic breakthrough in the local elections earlier this month – Mr Farage won 23 per cent of the vote, just two per cent behind the Conservatives and five per cent behind Mr Miliband – Labour backbenchers have joined their Tory counterparts in calling for action to tackle the UKIP threat. John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, . Nottinghamshire, said his party should ‘wake up and get real on . immigration’, adding: ‘Too many employers are underpaying British . workers and using cheap labour from abroad.’ The UKIP film was produced by Linda . McDougall – the wife of Grimsby Labour MP Austin Mitchell – who makes . the Channel 4 broadcasts for all the political parties. Last night, Ms . McDougall said she found the new UKIP strategy ‘fascinating’. Breakthough: UKIP won 23 per cent of the vote, just five per cent behind Ed Miliband and Labour backbenchers have called for action to tackle the UKIP threat . ‘With my non-political producer’s hat on, I thought it was very interesting that UKIP thinks there are votes to be had from the white working classes – although they don’t express it in quite those terms – who feel that they have been failed by Labour. ‘Everywhere we went in this very Labour, inner-city London area, people said to Nuttall, “You’ve got my vote.” And they all, without exception, said they wanted to leave the EU. ‘I said to Austin that it was like the 1980s, under Thatcher, when everyone would come up to us and say, “You’ve got my vote.” ’ Yesterday, as if to emphasise the point, a Labour councillor on Mr Mitchell’s own turf defected to UKIP. Lincolnshire councillor Jane Bramley said: ‘I couldn’t stay with Labour any longer. I agree with most of the policies that UKIP have and I think it is a fairer party.’ Mr Farage recently pledged to ‘gun for Labour’ because of Mr Miliband’s ‘abject’ refusal to back a nationwide in/out ballot on the EU.","Farage mounting drive to recruit Labour voters who feel abandoned .

A model with 'excessively long toes' used stolen credit card details to pay for £5,000 worth of corrective surgery, a court heard. Denise Whylie, who also works as an actress, had the procedure for her 'mallet toe deformity,' which meant her second and third toes were a lot longer than they should be, jurors were told. The 38-year-old allegedly gave the Premier Foot and Ankle Centre the fake name Denise Stephens and claimed her father, then her uncle would settle the bill with credit cards over the phone. It was not until six days later that the clinic realised the cards, belonging to two women and one man, were stolen when it was contacted by the bank, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. On trial: Denise Whylie, pictured modelling (left) and outside Blackfriars Crown Court (right), where she stands accused of using stolen credit card details to pay for surgery to correct her 'excessively long toes' Whylie, of Brentford, Middlesex, was arrested last June. She denied the offence claiming she had given the cash to a friend who worked at the clinic who could get her a discount price but only if they paid for the procedure themselves. She was charged with fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud two months later. Opening the case today, prosecutor John Traversi said: 'This is a strange case of fraud because of the nature of what it was the prosecution say was obtained by fraud. 'It was not goods from a shop or supermarket, it was a service, and the service was a surgical procedure on the defendant’s feet. 'And this case is about how that was paid for, or rather as the prosecution would advance not paid for. 'What happened was a lady calling herself Denise Stephens, who is the defendant Denise Whylie, called the clinic to make an appointment regarding surgery. 'She saw a surgeon who noted she had . excessively long second and third toes on each foot and surgery was . booked in for what was described as mallet toe deformity.' Alleged scam: It was not until six days later that the clinic realised the cards, belonging to two women and one man, were stolen when it was contacted by the bank, Blackfriars Crown Court (above) heard . The court heard Whylie was supposed to . pay £120 for the consultation but she told them her father would pay . later as she had no money at the time, giving his name as Duncan . Stephens who lived in Yorkshire. Her . surgery was booked in for May 9 but when the clinic had still not been . paid upfront the day before the surgery they called Whylie who told them . her uncle would now be paying, it is alleged. The . court heard a man then called the central London clinic on and tried to . pay using three different credit cards, which were all declined. But the payment went through on another three cards and Whylie had the surgery at a BMI hospital in London’s Fitzroy Square. ‘Over the telephone, he provided the . details of three different cards all of which were tried to facilitate . the necessary payment all of which were declined,’ Mr Traversi . continued. ‘Then finally . two cards were accepted, and a £2,000 and a £1,000 payment was made on . the first, and a £2,000 payment on the second. Prosecutor John Traversi . ‘The payment seemed to go through okay.’ On May 10, she attended the surgery at the BMI Fitzroy Hospital, Fitzroy Square, central London and underwent the £5,000 surgery. But six days later credit card company HBOS contacted the company to tell them the payment wouldn’t go through because the cards were being investigated for fraud. When the details of the cards provided by Whylie’s ‘uncle’ were checked, they were traced to the accounts of HBOS customers Paul Fearns and Dulcie Wilson, the court heard. The scam resulted in a £5,000 loss to the clinic. She voluntarily attended a police station on June 14 and told officers she was ‘not aware of any problems with payment or knowledge or involvement of fraud of any kind.’ Whylie, who states she is a model, actress and business owner of hair extensions company HairXtensionsXpress online, denies the charges between April 30 and May 11 last year. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Denise Whylie's second and third toes longer than they should be, trial told .

'Left in tears': Kayleigh Crawford killed herself just five days after being sexually assaulted on a night out with friends, an inquest heard . A coroner has criticised health experts for the way they treated a sex-assault victim just days before she killed herself. Kayleigh Crawford, 25, was assessed at a counselling centre hours after being groped on a night out. But an inquest heard a support worker failed to check on how she was feeling emotionally, instead focusing just on her physical symptoms. The British Gas worker was found hanged at her home in Llanrumney, Cardiff, five days later. The coroner said she was 'really, really concerned' about her treatment and will be writing to the chief medical officer for Wales and the Chief Coroner for England and Wales to demand changes. Kayleigh was taken out for the night by friends to cheer her up after splitting from her boyfriend. But she was left in tears after being fondled by a man as she left a nightclub. The inquest heard Kayleigh went to police after her night out and was taken to an NHS Sexual Assault Referral Centre called Safe Island. The pioneering centre at Cardiff Royal Infirmary offers advice and emotional support and counselling for sex assault victims. Advocacy support worker Carol Smith told the inquest how she went through a checklist of questions with Kayleigh after she arrived upset in the early hours of the morning. But Ms Smith admitted she could not recall asking Kayleigh if she was feeling low or if she had suicidal thoughts following the assault. Cardiff Coroner Miss Mary Hassell said: 'In that risk assessment she was asked: ""How are you feeling?"" 'She responded by saying: ""I'm feeling sick, I'm not eating"" - all physical symptoms. 'That should not have been accepted as the sum total of how she was feeling emotionally. 'It may have been that she misunderstood or evaded it because she felt uncomfortable. But that doesn't mean a follow-up question can't be asked. 'I don't know if it would have made any difference, but I'm really, really concerned about the way that conversation went. I think that something needs to change there.' Criticised: A health team at the sexual assault referral centre at Cardiff Royal Infirmary (above) failed to properly assess Miss Crawford's emotional state before she took her life, an inquest was told . Miss Hassell said she would be sending a report to the Sexual Assault Referral Centre, the chief medical officer for Wales and the Chief Coroner for England and Wales. Kayleigh was described as a 'bubbly and happy' young woman who had been left 'particularly low' at the break-up of her long-term relationship. The inquest heard she had taken an overdose after the break-up in February, was on anti-depressants and was receiving counselling. Her mother Lynn Crawford said after the hearing: 'She was a beautiful, wonderful and caring girl. We all loved her to bits. 'She's our little diamond in the sky now. On her birthday every year, she would insist on having a barbeque, come rain or shine. 'So we'll be doing that now to celebrate her birthday and remember the better times.' Miss Crawford's sister Nadine Carter said: 'The memories we have of her are so lovely. She was an amazing person.' South Wales Police said a 29-year-old man was questioned over the sexual assault, but the investigation ended when Kayleigh died. Verdict: Suicide.","Kayleigh Crawford, 25, sent to counselling centre hours after being groped .

Command Royal Airforce, Strike Hard Strike Sure.' The graffiti comes in the wake of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby. Head . of facilities at the RAF Benevolent Fund Gary Ross said the . organisation was saddened by the vandalism, especially given the charity . now had to pay for its removal. Disgraceful: A council worker removes the word 'Islam' from the Animals In War memorial in London's Park Lane after it was attacked by vandals .

Investigation: Police are yet to make arrests over the vandalism which came in the wake of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich . Message: This image shows the word 'Islam' daubed on the Animals In War Memorial, but police are not sure if it was carried out by Muslim protesters or far-right groups trying to stir up trouble . Up to 1,000 EDL supporters chanted ‘no surrender’ and held pictures of a bloody meat cleaver as they marched past Downing Street . Meanwhile, two men have been remanded in custody to appear before a crown court judge after a mosque was petrol-bombed, court officials said today. Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre was attacked for the second time in three days on Sunday while a young family was inside. Stuart Harness, 33, and Gavin Humphries, 37, both of Grimsby, were arrested in connection with the incident and appeared at the town’s magistrates’ court today. They are charged with arson with intent to endanger life and were denied bail, a magistrates’ court official said. No pleas were entered and the case will be sent to Grimsby Crown Court where it will be heard on June 7, the court official added. The petrol-bombing was the second time the centre on Weelsby Road has been targeted since Drummer Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich last week. Eleven teenagers, aged 16 and 17, were arrested after a party spiralled out of control on Thursday. Chief superintendent Tony Forbes, of Humberside Police, said: 'It is important to remember that those people who have committed these offences are a very small minority and they do not reflect the vast majority of people who live in North East Lincolnshire.' In stark contrast to the violence and vandalism that has dogged the country in recent days, dozens of . strangers continued to leave floral tributes and poignant messages to Lee Rigby today. Members of the public braved the rain to add to the growing pile of flowers, teddy bears, poems left at . the scene where the father-of-one was hacked to death in Woolwich last week. Many of the tributes came from veterans, fellow servicemen and women and their families.

The service, led by the Sedgefield Veterans, took place outside St Edmunds Church where a flag was lowered to half mast. The group holds a service for every serving solider who dies on duty. Over the Bank Holiday weekend, Drummer Rigby's widow made a tearful pilgrimage to the scene of his death the day after his fiancee made the same heartbreaking trip. Rebecca Rigby, the mother of the . soldier’s two-year-old son Jack, laid a wreath amid hundreds of other . floral tributes to her estranged husband.

Mark of respect: The Sedgefield Veterans hold a service for every serving solider who dies on duty with today's service passing over 250 since 2009 . Another card tucked inside the wreath read: ‘For my daddy.’ Mrs Rigby, 30, sobbed and cradled a pink Peppa Pig soft toy as she pinned a balloon with the words ‘Dad in a million’ close to the spot in Woolwich where 25-year-old Drummer Rigby was butchered by two Islamic fanatics on Wednesday. Drummer Rigby had survived Taliban bombs and bullets during a tour of duty as a machine gunner in Afghanistan, only to be slaughtered on the streets of London. It is understood that he had separated from his wife, and started a relationship with army colleague Aimee West. Miss West, 22, was flown back from Helmand where she was serving with the Royal Military Police. On Saturday, she wept as she set down a bouquet of roses at the scene of his murder. The name of murdered soldier Lee Rigby will be inscribed on a national memorial honouring Britain’s fallen servicemen and women. Trustees for the Armed Forces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire, said Drummer Rigby’s name would be included as he had died in a terrorist attack. Drummer Rigby, 25, who had been serving with the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed in a knife attack carried out in broad daylight in Woolwich, London, last Wednesday. In a statement, the memorial trustees said: 'Lee Rigby was killed as a result of terrorist action outside Woolwich Barracks in London on May 22 and qualifies for inclusion on the ArmedForces Memorial. 'His name, along with other members of the UK armed forces who are killed on duty or through terrorist action in 2013, will be engraved in time for the annual service of dedication in mid-2014. 'The families of the bereaved are always invited to attend, usually in the presence of a member of the Royal Family, a defence minister and senior armed forces representatives.' The memorial honours all members of the UK’s armed forces who have died in conflicts or as a result of terrorist attacks since the end of the Second World War.","London monuments to bomber pilots and war horses daubed with graffiti .

A Democratic Louisiana state senator fled from a TV reporter on Wednesday as he tried to ask her questions about her claim on the Senate floor that opponents of President Barack Obama's signature health care overhaul law are motivated by the color of his skin. Karen Carter Peterson, who also chairs the Louisiana Democratic Party, claimed Monday that opposition to Obamacare is 'about the race of this African-American president.' 'It's not about how many federal dollars we can receive. It's not about that,' she told her fellow lawmakers. 'You ready? It's about race. No, nobody wants to talk about that. It’s about the race of this African-American president.' But when WBRZ-TV2 reporter Ryan Naquin tried to ask her about those comments, she dashed down a set of stairs and ran into an area of the state capitol where he couldn't follow her. Naquin said during his broadcast report that when he sent Peterson a written request for comment, she was seen taking it off her desk and throwing it in the garbage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Karen Carter Peterson (C), pictured with Barack and Michelle Obama, runs the Louisiana Democratic Party. She said on the floor of the state Senate that 'the race of this African-American president' explained widespread opposition to his healthcare overhaul law . Peterson made her comments during a Senate floor speech, quickly drawing condemnation from Republicans and conspicuous silence from Democrats . Peterson (center, in red) ran, literally, from news cameras when a reporter asked her about her suggestion that only racists oppose Obamacare . As evidence for her claim of racism, Peterson said Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich once proposed 'this same thing' - an individual health care mandate. She quickly walked that claim back, however, saying that Gingrich's proposal was merely 'similar' to Obama's. But she insisted that opposition to Obama's Affordable Care Act 'comes down to the race of the president of the United States, which causes people to disconnect and step away from the substance of the bill. The latest poll on Obamacare's popularity, a survey by CNN and Opinion Research Corp. released May 27, showed that 54 per cent of Americans oppose it, down from 59 per cent while the bill was being debated in Congress. Just 43 per cent support the law, which will take full effect in 2014. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (L) slammed Peterson for 'name-calling' and 'calling people a racist,' and asked for an apology. State Sen. Elbert Guillory (R) said, 'Some decks have only one card in it, and that's the race card' Peterson's Wikipedia entry was quietly edited on Thursday to read for several hours that she has 'embarrassed' - not 'represented' - Louisiana's '5th DIstrict since 2010' 'The suggestion that more than half . of the people in Louisiana are racist because of their concerns is . absurd,' National Republican Senatorial Committee spokeswoman Brook . Hougesen told The Washington Post. Tying the dustup to national politics, Hougesen added that Peterson's statement also 'raises serious questions about where [Sen.] Mary Landrieu stands.' 'Landrieu cast the deciding vote to . make Obamacare law, and she owes it to voters to weigh in on the . offensive comments made by the head of her Democratic party.' Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told WBRZ that Peterson should retract her claims of racism. 'There's a way to have that debate' about Obamacare, he said. 'There's a way to express your opinion without name calling, without calling people a racist.' 'I'd hope the senator would apologize. I'd hope she'd go to the well and retract her comments.' Jindal and other Republican governors oppose Obamacare because expanding their states' Medicaid programs with federal dollars would put added pressure on state budgets when those dollars disappear in later years. When Ryan Naquin, a reporter with WBRZ-TV2 in Baton Rouge, ran after Peterson to ask her about her comments, she dashed down a set of stairs and ran into an area of the state capitol where journalists are not allowed . State Sen. Elbert Guillory, a Democrat, told WBRZ that he opposes Obamacare - but he's no racist. And, he noted wryly, 'Not only am I African-American, I'm black.' 'Some decks have only one card in it, and that's the race card,' Guillory said. 'And I'm so sick of hearing it.' An unknown vandal changed Peterson's Wikipedia entry on Thursday, replacing a single word so it began, 'Karen Carter Peterson (born November 1, 1969) is an African American Democratic member of the Louisiana State Senate, having embarrassed the 5th District since 2010.' The article was quickly returned to its original text. Peterson claimed that former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich once proposed 'this same thing' in the past without widespread opposition. She quickly modified that comment, however, saying that his health care plan was merely 'similar' to Obama's . Peterson (R), then a state Rep. named Karen Carter, lost her 2006 race for Congress against the incumbent Democrat William Jefferson. She conceded the race next to her then-fiancee, Dana Peterson (L)","Karen Carter Peterson claimed in a floor speech that opposition to Obamacare is 'about the race of this African-American president'

You may have been trying to get out of doing the lawn since last weekend, but as a nation we’ve been attempting to find a way to avoid it for more than 50 years. Nowhere was that more obvious than at the Chelsea Flower Show yesterday as the latest gadgets for keeping life easy in the garden were revealed. In 1959, Chelsea featured a ‘Garden of To-morrow’ showcasing a remote-controlled mower which the exhibitors said would revolutionise the way we cut our lawns. Scroll down for video . Job done: the latest robotic lawn mower in the form of the Bosch Indego, which allows the owner to look on and relax . The mower, manufactured by Birmingham-based company HC Webb, was demonstrated to guests at the 1959 show who marvelled at its battery powered engine with enough power to cut grass at 2mph with a range of one mile. The exhibition brochure also predicted that ‘mist propagation, automatic blinds and thermostatic controls for greenhouse heating and ventilation’ were ‘confidently expected within a few years.’ But it said that ‘plastics’ were ‘the most exciting development for gardeners’, with the exhibitors gushing that there were now ‘plastic cord and labels that would never rot’ and ‘polythene containers that allowed you to see the level of the contents without opening them.’ Some 54 years later, crowds at this week’s flower show showed equal enthusiasm when today’s cutting edge lawnmowers were demonstrated. Far from the Webb model’s clunky remote control panel and cumbersome box that looked like Doctor Who’s assistant K9, the Indego robotic lawn mower drew intrigue from passers by as it meandered around a grassy patch at this year’s flower show. The state of the art “robo-mower” handles the cutting of the grass without human intervention, while its owner ‘relaxes’ nearby. It can handle lawns with an area of up to 1,000 square meters (10,764 sq ft), although after doing about 200 (2,153) it will have to take itself back to its charger to top up its lithium-ion battery pack. It is able to find that charger on its own, and takes 90 minutes to fully recharge. Once re-charged it will return to the point where it left off, and continue mowing. It takes about 20 minutes to mow each 200 sq m – which is four times quicker than other robotic mower previously made, the company claims. Part of the reason for its speediness is the fact that it mows in orderly sequential rows, like a farmer swathing their crops. Blast from the past: The Webb Radio Controlled lawn mower being demonstrated at the Chelsea Flower Show in 1959 . It is also able to sense obstacles or surfaces it should not mow, such as gravel, and automatically figures out how to adjust its mowing pattern in order to avoid those. It is better for the grass than similar robotic lawn mowers and is more energy efficient because it works systematically around the garden rather than mowing randomly in a pingball effect. The mower costs £1,399 from B&Q and is British-manufactured for Bosch in Stonemarket, Suffolk.","The Indego robotic lawn mower cuts the grass without human intervention .

Andrew Kitzenberg tweeted photos of the 'firefight' between two terror suspects and police, which he witnessed from his window in Watertown . Andrew Kitzenburg posted photos of a bullet hole in his apartment which penetrated the wall and his roommate's chair as police and terror suspects exchanged gunfire . He told NBC: 'I was sitting in the living room and started hearing gunfire outside our apartment. I went to the window and saw two people behind a black . Mercedes S.U.V. and a Sedan right next to it. 'About 70 or 80 yards down the street was six police vehicles. They were engaged in gunfire for a few minutes, they were also utilising bombs and what looked like grenades and a pressure cooker bomb. 'It was a firefight. There was a long exchange of gunfire and shooters had hand guns.' He described how the fight came to a climax when one of the suspects was 'taken down' and the other escaped in a car. 'The Sedan was parked easterly on Laurel Street and the S.U.V. to the west, separated by 10ft. They were in between to two cars taking cover behind the Mercedes shooting westwards. 'When they utilised their larger bomb they threw it towards the officers as a decoy. It covered the street with smoke. 'One ran towards the cops, the other one got back into the S.U.V. The one running towards the officers was taken down. 'The second shooter got into the S.U.V, turned it around and went full speed towards the police officers, went through the middle between the cop cars taking off the doors and breaking through.' Peter Jennings, 33, said he woke to the sound of an explosion just before 1am at home on Prentiss Street in Watertown. ‘It sounded like a stick of dynamite . went off. I looked out the window, and it was like nothing I’ve ever . seen – blue light after blue light after blue light.’ He said the air smelled like ‘at the end of a fireworks show, like a wick smell.’ ‘I had a bad feeling because of what happened on Monday,’ he added. Reports of more than 36 emergency vehicles with sirens blaring were heading down Route 16 West. John Antonucci said told his 79-year-old mother to stay inside her house as she witnessed the shootout from her window. ‘She was saying they’re running down the street shooting,' she said. 'She was crying so hard I couldn’t understand what she was talking about.’ A man was ordered by armed police officers to stay on the ground in Watertown, Massachusetts following the shooting of a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Residents of Watertown have been ordered to remain at home and to only answer their doors to police as part of the hunt for the second terror suspect . Collin Ausfeld, 26, said he was concerned for the safety of his home and his thoughts after the dramatic stand-off were:  ‘I hope the apartment doesn’t blow up.’ Taxi driver Imran Saif said he had planned to cycle home and started to pedal towards sounds of what he believed to be 'fireworks'. He said people in nearby houses started waving him back shouting that the loud noises were gunfire. ‘It just sounded like there was automatic weapons going off, and I heard a few explosions,’ he said. ‘They sounded like fireworks, mostly, big fireworks going off -- tons, I’d say. I’m really scared. When I found out it was gunshots, that just knocked the wind out of me.’ Citizens of Watertown initially believed bangs to be fireworks but realised they were in fact gunshots and explosions . Dan MacDonald, was watching TV when he heard ‘maybe five or seven’ sirens and then the noise of 15 gunshots within 10 seconds. ‘I kind of ran downstairs and came outside,’ he said. ‘They were coming from the Arsenal Street area up Bigelow Avenue.

TalkTalk has been fined £750,000 for making an excessive number of abandoned and silent calls, which could have caused 'annoyance and distress' to consumers. The TV, broadband and phone provider made 9,000 silent or abandoned calls to potential customers between February 1 and March 21, 2011, at two of its call centres. The fine follows an investigation by Ofcom aiming to reduce harm caused by such calls, where individuals hear silence when they answer the phone. TalkTalk was fined £750,000 by Ofcom for making 9,000 silent calls to customers in less than two months . It was found TalkTalk exceeded the limit of abandoned calls which organisations are permitted to make four times in 2011 during one of its telemarketing campaigns. It also failed to ensure information messages were played, meaning consumers answered their phones and heard no sound coming from the other end of the line. As a result, TalkTalk made approximately 9,000 silent and abandoned calls to consumers. During another marketing campaign, TalkTalk failed to make a ‘reasoned estimate’ as to the accuracy of its answer machine detection and also failed to keep adequate records to show it complied with answer machine technology requirements. On one day in that period TalkTalk also failed to ensure call centre workers handled cases where an earlier call made on the same day had been picked up by an answer machine. Ofcom said TalkTalk was ultimately responsible for the actions of the two call centre operators associated with the breach, Teleperformance Limited and McAlpine Marketing Limited. The silent calls could have caused 'annoyance or distress' to custmoers, who heard silence when they answered the phone . Ofcom's consumer group director, Claudio Pollack, said: ‘Silent and abandoned calls can cause annoyance and distress to consumers. Companies must abide by the law and Ofcom's policies. If they fail to do so then Ofcom will take firm action. ‘Today's penalty sends out a strong message to organisations using call centres that they must comply or face the consequences.’ A TalkTalk spokesman said: ‘In February and March 2011, two of TalkTalk's suppliers, Teleperformance and McAlpine Marketing, made a number of silent and abandoned marketing calls. ‘TalkTalk demands high standards from the companies it works with and as a result TalkTalk immediately stopped using these suppliers. 'Both suppliers addressed the root cause of the problem and TalkTalk will fully recover the financial penalty imposed by Ofcom from these companies. ‘TalkTalk works with all its partners to ensure that regulations are adhered to and that customers continue to get good service and best value.’ The fine against TalkTalk was welcomed by consumer watchdog group Which? as a step towards ending excessive nuisance calls directed at consumers. Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which? said: ‘It's good to see Ofcom flexing its muscles against abandoned and silent calls. 'With so many people telling us they are being bombarded by nuisance calls and texts, we have been calling for all the relevant regulators to work together to properly police and punish those responsible with substantial fines and suspension of licences.’ Last month Which? found that in the last three months 70 per cent of people received unsolicited calls and 40 per cent got an unwanted text.","TalkTalk breached the maximum number silent calls four times in 2011 .

All Jorie Rogers asked was to live long enough to see her son's first birthday in March. The terminally ill mom got her wish and then fought on for another six weeks before tragically losing her battle with cancer, and saying goodbye to her 'miracle' baby, on Mother's Day. Rogers, 32, was told her radiation treatment would leave her unable to have a child, but she managed to conceive anyway, and in 2012 gave birth to little Tristan. 'She fiercely loved her son Tristan like . a lioness,' her friend, Tisa Perra, said on Sunday in a heart-breaking tribute on Facebook. Tragedy: Courageous cancer patient, Jorie Rogers, pictured left with son Tristan, died on Mother's Day . 'Her fighting spirit was an inspiration to many. She lived . her life fully despite disease and suffering. May she rest in peace. May . she be free from suffering.' Perra, the leader of a Facebook cancer . support group of which Rogers was a member, also described the mother as . a 'valiant and courageous Pheo Trooper.' 'Jorie Wilson Rogers, was a loving mom, wife, sister, daughter and friend,' she wrote on Sunday. Rogers and her husband George Rogers celebrated Tristan's first birthday in late March with a carnival-themed party complete with a bounce house, balloons and a big cake. They wanted to make it memorable because they knew it would be his first and last with his mother.

The mom from Ladue, Montana, suffered . paraganglioma, a rare form of cancer that caused dozens of tumors in her . body.

In the weeks before her death, Rogers' condition had deteriorated significantly along with her spirit. On May 6 she wrote on Facebook: 'Do you know how hard it is to write when your hands don't work anymore? How about eating, typing, brushing your teeth, wiping your butt, tying your shoelaces, getting dressed? Yeah, it is all nearly impossible. Its all humiliating. And it all sucks. I used to pray I would make it to my next birthday, now I don't.' Ashley Swip, the president and founder of 3 Little Birds 4 Life, which organized Tristan's spectacular birthday party, said George Rogers broke the sad news to her on Sunday morning. Strong: Rogers and husband George Rogers, left, were told they couldn't conceive but had little Tristan anyway . 'Jorie was really special, and today's been really bittersweet,' Swip told the New York Daily News. 'I'm so glad we were able to meet her and her family. And we will continue to help the family in any way possible.' Rogers was told she would not live to see Tristan, who has Down syndrome, turn two, so she wanted to make his first birthday special. Knee deep in medical bills, it seemed unlikely that the Rogers would be able to go ahead with the party for Tristan. But the mom's wish was granted when Illinois charity 3 Little Birds 4 Life stepped in and threw Tristan a carnival to celebrate his first year. The party included clowns, balloons, a . bouncy castle and a colorful birthday cake. Rogers said: 'It's so . much more than I could have hoped for. It's amazing.'

She said: 'My cancer has unfortunately . progressed to a point where there's really nothing else that we can do. We've pretty much run the gamut and tried everything. 'So we're just going to live out the rest of the days as best we can and be as happy as we can with the time we have left.' Although Tristan will be too young to . remember the party, Rogers wanted him to have photos and videos of . the day as keepsakes after she passed away. She added in March: 'I want him to be able to look back on videos and pictures from today and hear the stories about today, and for him to know how much his mom loved him. And for him to know how hard his mom fought to be here for him.’ The charity which organized the party, 3 Little Birds 4 Life, has also fixed a young man's 'chemo teeth' and helped a person with brain cancer go to Disney World.","Jorie Rogers passed away yesterday after battling cancer .

Gerald Yilmaz was sent home twice from A&E after doctors before he died of complications caused by a brain abscess . A man with a deadly brain abscess died after he was sent home twice by A&E doctors who mistook his symptoms for his learning disability, an inquest heard. Staff at Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London, failed to diagnose Gerald Yilmaz’s  condition. They wrongly attributed his confusion and a drooping eyelid to his learning disability, the hearing was told. Mr Yilmaz, 37, of Finsbury Park, visited A&E three times in as many days last July. But he was twice discharged by doctors who thought he only had an ear infection and a migraine, St Pancras coroner’s court heard. Mr Yilmaz’s sister, Sevim Yilmaz, 35, said after the inquest: ‘We knew that something was not right. ‘His eye was drooping, but they thought he was just like that. ‘It’s devastating, we just think what would have happened if they diagnosed him earlier?’ The inquest has highlighted that symptoms can be wrongly overlooked in patients with learning difficulties because it is assumed they are part of their disability. Mr Yilmaz’s family is determined his death will have an impact on hospital procedures by forcing improvements at the Whittington and raising awareness of the problem. His younger brother, Muhammed Yilmaz, 22, said: ‘We hope that this will be the spark for change and we expect to see big changes from The Whittington. ‘This is not about individual blame, it’s about a system that’s broken.’ Beverley Dawkins, policy manager at learning disability charity Mencap, accompanied the family to the inquest. She said: ‘This is the biggest thing . that kills people with learning disabilities. The delay in diagnosis is . something that too many people experience.’ Mr Yilmaz, who worked as a gardener at The Harington Scheme in Cholmeley Park, Highgate, was diagnosed with an ear infection on July 2 and prescribed antibiotics by a GP. He . was taken to A&E on July 15 after his condition suddenly worsened . but was released with another prescription of antibiotics. Mr Yilmaz's family (pictured outside St Pancras Coroner's Court for his inquest) have called for the hospital to raise awareness about overlooking symptoms in disabled people . Mr Yilmaz, who had the IQ of a seven or eight-year-old, returned to hospital still ill the next day, the inquest heard. But Dr Edwina Lawson sent him home again after diagnosing an ear infection, this time combined with a migraine. Dr Lawson told the inquest that ‘diagnostic overshadowing’, whereby she attributed his symptoms to his learning disability, was a factor in her blunder. A report by the hospital also cited this as one of the main reasons that serious signs of Mr Yilmaz’s critical illness were not acted on. Whittington Hospital has pledged to host training sessions, improve and overhaul procedures and appoint a learning disabilities champion in the emergency department . Acting coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said the symptoms, including drowsiness, confusion and a drooping eyelid, should have rang alarm bells. She said Dr Lawson should have got a second opinion at the very least. Mr Yilmaz was finally sent for surgery at Queen’s Hospital, Romford, Essex, after returning to Whittington Hospital on July 17. But he died on July 23 of complications caused by the abscess after having three operations in a last-ditch bid to save his life. Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Radcliffe said: ‘It’s more likely than not that earlier detection and treatment to the cerebral infection [which caused the abscess] would have prevented a fatal outcome.’ A spokesman for Whittington Hospital said: 'We deeply regret the delay that occurred in making the correct diagnosis for this patient, and have offered our profound apologies and condolences to his family. 'The patient had a learning disability and our investigation highlighted the need for us to take additional steps to reduce the chance of patients with learning disabilities receiving a delayed diagnosis.  'We have since made substantial changes to strengthen the care we give to people with learning disabilities, and to minimise the chance of a similar delay in diagnosis happening again. 'These include ensuring that a specially trained nurse is called to act as an advocate when a patient with a learning disability comes to the hospital. 'We are also training all staff in the Emergency Department in the best care for patients with learning disabilities.'","Gerald Yilmaz, 37, had drowsiness, confusion and a drooping eyelid .

Petra Maison, pictured wearing her clothes yesterday, launched the line in Sweden after finding ordinary working clothes were ill-fitting and designed for men . There was a time when a woman would reach for a pair of old jeans and a tatty jumper to do the gardening. But this year’s Chelsea Flower Show looks set to raise flowerbeds in the fashion stakes. One of the most crowded pitches yesterday was designer Petra Maison’s range of ‘feminine and practical’ gardening clothes. Her Garden Girl collection, admired by Prince Charles, may be designed for maximum comfort but many will think the full ensemble is less than flattering. And wearers will have to fork out for the privilege – a pair of rose-patterned dungarees is priced at £66.95 and the entire kit modelled costs £387.60. Mrs Maison, pictured wearing her clothes yesterday, launched the line in Sweden after finding ordinary working clothes were ill-fitting and designed for men. The 40-year-old said: ‘I became addicted to gardening but when my husband bought work clothes for me to do the gardening in they weren’t comfortable and I hated them. ‘I wanted to make clothes that were made for women’s shapes which were feminine and practical. I have designed something that I want to wear myself.’ Her range includes durable ladies wear and tools ranging in price from £9.99 to £79. The couple have been running the business in Sweden for six years and have struggled to keep up with demand. She said: ‘We first sold it at a Swedish show like this and were worried no one would buy it. But on the second day of the five-day event we sold out. ‘In the early days of the business we struggled to keep up with demand, so we are really excited to be bringing the collection to the UK.’ Elsewhere in the show a group of Australians were also struggling to contain their glee, after Phillip Johnson and Fleming’s Nurseries were awarded the coveted prize of Best in Show for their Trailfinders garden. The Australian-inspired garden features 300 tons of Scottish gabbro rock, a billabong, a waterfall, natural Australian plants and sounds of Yarra Valley frogs recorded in designer Phillip Johnson’s garden. The garden, which has a self-sustaining eco system, was awarded a gold medal as well as Best in Show. When the Best in Show title was announced Tim Wilkinson, a volunteer who helped create the garden, jumped into the billabong wearing only his underwear in celebration. Mr Johnson said: ‘Winning today was the most amazing feeling ever, after becoming a father. We were jumping up and down like a bunch of madmen when Best in Show was announced. ‘Being involved in Chelsea was a dream come true for myself and my team. Winning an award amongst contemporaries of this calibre is absolutely mind-blowing.

He added: ‘It’s very difficult to put a price on the garden; we worked with volunteers and had an enormous amount of donations of materials. ‘At a guess I would say it cost £2.2million to £3million, there’s only one of these in the world after all.’ Mr Johnson said: 'Winning today was most amazing feeling ever, after becoming a father.

Goth loner: Adam Lanza, a troubled 20-year-old loner with a history of autistic behaviour, is the monster behind a horrific shooting at a Connecticut elementary school . Crazed killer Adam Lanza was a ‘ticking time bomb’ who suffered from Asperger’s syndrome and was  painfully shy and awkward, former classmates said yesterday. Last night, a troubling portrait began to emerge of the ‘Goth’ loner, who dressed all in black and was obsessed with video games. The 20-year-old – who shot dead 27 people in America’s worst-ever school killing – began his rampage by blasting his mother, Nancy, in the face at the family’s £1 million home in Newtown, Connecticut, dubbed America’s ‘safest town’. He then drove her black Honda Civic to Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he killed 20 young children and six adults before  shooting himself in the head. He took to the school four guns, which were registered to his mother, an avid collector. Residents said she often talked about taking her son for  target practice. Former classmate Olivia DeVivo said she remembered Lanza talking about ‘blowing things up’, but added: ‘I put that down to the usual talk of boys. I think he went so unnoticed people didn’t stop to think, “There’s something going on here – maybe he needs some kind of help?” ‘No one is surprised. He always seemed like he was someone who was capable of that because he didn’t really connect with our high  school, with our town.’ Beth Israel, whose daughter Alex attended the local high school with Lanza, added: ‘He was just pale and scrawny, a weird kid. He was quiet, shy, socially awkward. He had vacant eyes.’ Another former school friend, Jamie Crespo, 19, said: ‘He used to hang with the freaks, guys who dressed in trench coats.’ Lanza appears to have enjoyed a normal childhood, attending Sandy Hook Elementary and then Newtown High School, in the affluent town 60 miles from New York. He refused to pose for the traditional high school yearbook picture – a rite of passage in America. Instead, a note on the page under his name states: ‘Camera shy.’ Yesterday reports claimed he had been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, a form of autism where sufferers experience difficulties with communication and social skills, which can lead to isolation and emotional problems. Mother: Fifty-two-year-old Nancy Lanza, pictured, was shot dead by her son, Adam Lanza. He drove her black Honda Civic to Sandy Hook Elementary School. Nancy was an avid gun collector . Nancy Lanza's home in Newtown, Connecticut, was raided after 2 pm Friday and she was found shot dead from an apparent gunshot wound to the face . Adam Lanza allegedly stole his mother's car keys after shooting her dead and drove the car, pictured, to the school to carry out the massacre . Neighbour Justin Germak, 17, said he knew Lanza ‘had a condition’. ‘You definitely noticed it. He was needy. He struggled to be social.’ Family friends said Lanza’s  problems started to escalate when his parents divorced in 2008 after 18 years together. His father Peter, a wealthy executive for General Electric, who is believed to earn $1 million a year, moved out of the family home in 2006, citing ‘irreconcilable differences’. Father: Peter, a wealthy executive for General Electric, who is believed to earn $1million a year, moved out of the family home in 2006 . The 52-year-old married librarian Shelley Cudiner last year, and the couple moved 40 miles away to Stamford, Connecticut. However, he continued to provide well for Nancy and their younger son, giving her the family home as well as nearly £200,000 a year. One of Lanza’s former classmates spoke of his ‘noticeable decline’ after his parents’ divorce. ‘He was a loner at school and hyper intelligent,’ he said. ‘But in recent years he disappeared off the radar. ‘The word is that he was badly affected when his parents split and that might be what pushed him over the edge. ‘He was always weird but the divorce affected him. He was arguing with his mother. He was a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.’ Other students remember him walking through school dressed in black, carrying a black briefcase. Catherine Urso, whose son knew the killer, said: ‘He just said he was  very remote, one of the Goths.’ Sources close to the investigation also revealed last night that Nancy had recently stopped hosting monthly get-togethers for neighbours in order to look after her increasingly troubled son. The 50-year-old is thought to have worked as a supply teacher at the elementary school where the shootings took place. Dan Holmes, owner of a landscaping firm who worked on the family’s home, said she was an avid gun  collector: ‘She told me she would go target shooting with her kids.’ Last night it also emerged Nancy was a member of the Doomsday Preppers movement, which believes people should prepare for end of the world. Shooting spree: Adam Lanza talked about 'blowing things up' and was described as a 'weird kid' Brother: Adam's 24-year-old brother, Ryan Lanza, is seen being led away from his Hoboken home in New Jersey to be questioned by police over the shooting . Ryan Lanza is escorted to a car outside his home in Hoboken by law enforcement. Police said he has been very cooperative during the investigation . Her former sister-in-law Marsha said she had turned her home ‘into a fortress’. She added: ‘Nancy had a survivalist philosophy which is why she was stockpiling guns. She had them for defence. ‘She was stockpiling food. She grew up on a farm in New Hampshire. She was skilled with guns. We talked about preppers and preparing for the economy collapsing.’ Marsha added that her nephew  had been raised by ‘kind, nurturing’ parents’. She said she last seen Adam in June but recalled nothing appeared out of the ordinary. ‘Nancy was a good mother, kind-hearted,’ she added. ‘She wasn’t one to deny reality. She would have sought psychiatric help for her son had she felt he needed it.’ The families of victims grieve near Sandy Hook Elementary School . Mourners gather inside the St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church at a vigil service for victims of the Sandy Hook School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut . Is Obama ready to take on America's powerful gun lobby? President Obama will be in  for the fight of his political life  if he follows through on his call  for ‘meaningful action’ on  gun-control laws in the US following the massacre. With tears in his eyes, the President said: ‘We have been through this too many times.  We’re going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.’ As America reels at the scale  of the atrocity and the age of  the children involved, anti-gun activists hope Connecticut may  be the turning point for weapons restrictions when so many other shootings were not. President Obama openly wept as he spoke of the mindless shooting, saying, 'Our hearts are broken today' For gun-control lobbyists, the Newtown massacre is compelling evidence that stronger laws are needed – even though Connecticut already has some of the toughest restrictions in place.But the gun lobby, in the shape of the powerful and well-funded National Rifle Association, will say that proves that the law can do only so much. ‘In general, the laws here are pretty strict, and they’re working,’ said Bob Crook, of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen. ‘But I don’t know of any law that would prevent someone like at Columbine or at Aurora or here in Connecticut from committing these offences, which are clearly psychologically based.’ A woman waits to hear about her sister, a teacher, following the tragic shooting this morning which has shocked the quiet suburban community . Chaotic scenes at the school as police work to secure the area and bodies are carried out of the school . To buy a gun, Connecticut law requires residents apply for a local permit, usually with the town’s police chief, have their fingerprints taken and submit to a state and federal background check with a 14-day waiting period. To buy a handgun, residents also have to take a gun-safety course.The state is also one of seven to have an assault weapons ban that lists more than 35 semi-automatic and automatic weapons. It does not appear to cover  the .223-calibre Bushmaster rifle with which Adam Lanza killed  his victims. Parents leave a staging area after being reunited with their children following a shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School . In addition to the rifle, Lanza was carrying two semi-automatic pistols, a Sig Sauer and a Glock. A fourth weapon was found  outside. All of the weapons appear to have been legally purchased  and registered to Lanza’s  mother, Nancy.

Adam Lanza, a troubled 20-year-old loner with a . history of autistic behavior, is the monster behind a horrific shooting . at a Connecticut elementary school . Originally from Rhode Island, Mrs . Hockley spent 18 years in England, marrying her British husband, who . works for IBM in New York, in Norwich in 1993. Both Dylan and Jake were . born in the UK. All the child massacre victims were . first-graders, aged six or seven. Seven adults, six women who worked at . the school, plus Lanza’s mother, also died at his hands, before he . killed himself. The day before his killing spree the . 20-year-old ‘Goth’ was reported to have visited the school – where he . had been a pupil at least a decade ago – and had an ‘altercation’ with . four members of staff. Three of those four are now among the . dead. The fourth person was not at the school on Friday when he went on . his rampage and is now being interviewed by police. However, it was still not clear . yesterday precisely what caused Lanza, a socially awkward loner, to . snap, though detectives said they had found ‘clues’, thought to be . emails, at his mother Nancy’s home, where he lived. A grey-haired man who was laying . flowers outside the school described the Hockleys as a ‘very nice . family’ adding: ‘They fitted in this community perfectly. We were close . friends, like family.

They called us and said just a few words, “Our son is not with us any more”. That’s how it happened.’ As police released the identities of . all the victims last night, it  was confirmed that they were all shot . several times by a semi-automatic rifle. Medical examiner Wayne Carver, said he examined seven of the children killed, and two had been shot at close range. When asked how many bullets were fired, he said: ‘I’m lucky if I can tell you how many I found.’ Police said they had found ‘very good . evidence’ they hoped would answer questions about the motives of the . 20-year-old gunman, described by those who knew him as brilliant but . remote. Witnesses said Lanza didn’t say a word during his murderous spree. And investigators said they found no . note or ‘manifesto’ of the sort they have come to expect after murderous . rampages. Just one person, a woman who worked at the school, was shot . and survived – an unusually small number in a mass shooting – and police . lieutenant Paul Vance said her testimony would be ‘instrumental’ in the . case. Traumatized students were seen being led out of the school crying and holding hands . A Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols, . and a .223-calibre Bushmaster rifle were found in the school and a . fourth weapon was found outside. It has also emerged that, on Tuesday, . Lanza tried to buy an extra rifle to bulk up his arsenal at local . sporting goods store, Dicks, where semi-automatic rifles are priced as . low as $49.98 (£31). Inevitably, the question of America’s liberal gun laws has been raised by the massacre. The family of the gunman last night branded his actions ‘incomprehensible’.

Babymoon: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are enjoying a 'babymoon' at a £5million property on Mustique . It is one of the most sumptuous villas on one of the most exclusive paradise islands in the world. And, for the moment, this luxury £5 million house on Mustique is home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge – as they take a ‘babymoon’ break before the birth of their first child. Nestled amid lush tropical gardens, with dramatic views of the aquamarine Caribbean waters lapping a tranquil white-sand beach, the five-bedroom house normally costs £19,000 a week to rent. But it is not known whether the multi-millionaire owners, close friends of both the Royal couple and the wider Middleton family, are charging them for the stay. The dream home is furnished with Oriental antiques and comes with a staff of six servants, who oversee such amenities as a private cinema, gazebo and 64 ft infinity pool. During the lavish trip, the Duchess has been seen every day at the tennis courts on the privately owned island. However, she has been cheering from the sidelines rather than playing, as she has done on previous trips. Although she is four months pregnant, locals say the Duchess’s baby bump is hardly showing. ‘They’re having a very quiet, peaceful holiday, which is just what Kate needed,’ a long-time island resident said. ‘I’d heard they were planning to leave on Thursday but that they are enjoying themselves so much, they may stay until after Valentine’s Day.’ The couple have been joined by the Duchess’s sister Pippa, brother James and parents, Carole and Michael. The Middletons rented accommodation nearby to give the couple some privacy. Last Thursday night, all the Middletons, except Kate, visited Firefly, a fashionable bistro and guest house that has become a favourite of various young Royals, including William’s cousin, Zara Phillips, who used to drink there in her single days. Scroll down for video . Luxury: It is not yet known whether the couple, who have been joined at the property by the Middleton family, are paying for the stay as they are friends with the owners . But Royal links to Mustique go back to 1960, when Princess Margaret was given a ten-acre estate there. The Queen and Prince Philip have also made several visits to the island. An unprecedented veil of secrecy has been drawn over William and Kate’s visit, and The Mail on Sunday has decided not to reveal the  names of the villa’s owners or the property’s location because of security concerns. One American businesswoman, who is a regular visitor to the island, said: ‘The owners are an absolutely lovely pair and their villa is stunning. ‘It is perfect for William and Kate because it is luxurious and secluded. It is just what they need before the fervour of a newborn baby. I imagine they are on their guard after Kate was photographed topless in France, but there is no chance of that happening in Mustique.’ Vista: The five-bedroom property has a garden with stunning views over the sea . Lap of luxury: The 64ft infinity swimming pool and its sundeck . The island has rigorous entry requirements, which make it almost impossible for paparazzi to snoop on rich and famous villa owners, who include rockers Bryan Adams and Sir Mick Jagger, fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger and Jigsaw clothing chain founder John Robinson. Mr Robinson, who once employed Kate as a buyer, lent his villa to the couple for their first trip to Mustique, in 2006. The businesswoman said the villa’s owners – who went to William and Kate’s wedding – met the young Royals on Mustique’s casual social scene. ‘On the island, everyone is in a good mood, enjoying rum punch cocktails and having parties, so that’s how the two couples met,’ she said. ‘About four years ago, they got chatting and became friends. They happened to be visiting  the island at the same time. ‘People on the island are so happy to have Kate and William because they are so much in love, especially after what happened to Charles  and Diana.’ During six previous visits to the 1,400-acre island, William and Kate established a routine of vigorous sports – beach volleyball and Frisbee, tennis and water-skiing. Regulars: But Royal links to Mustique go back to 1960, when Princess Margaret was given a ten-acre estate there. The Queen and Prince Philip have also made several visits to the island . ‘Kate is very good on the tennis court, down to earth, humble and eager to chat with people, similar to Diana,’ said the businesswoman. In the evenings, the couple  would mingle with other villa owners over  ‘sundowner’ cocktails at Firefly or Basil’s Bar, owned by Basil Charles, a flamboyant entrepreneur who was a protege of both the island’s founder, the late peer Lord Glenconner, and Princess Margaret. Training regime: During six previous visits to the 1,400-acre island, William and Kate established a routine of vigorous sports - beach volleyball and Frisbee, tennis and water-skiing . ‘Kate’s favourite tipple was the Sunset Premium, a pina colada flavoured with local rum,’ recalled a Mustique source who, because of the island’s rules against press interviews, spoke on condition  of anonymity. He added that the Prince’s ‘poison’ was vodka and cranberry juice. The couple’s security detail would  watch discreetly at Basil’s waterfront establishment, where William is known for his performances of Elvis Presley numbers on karaoke nights. On one memorable evening, Kate danced with Basil. ‘He was boasting about it afterwards. She has that personable touch, very beautiful and magnificent,’ said the  businesswoman. ‘Kate’s parents are lovely too. They have been going to Mustique for years, although there is a hierarchical system on the island, so they are still considered part of the new society.’ Acquaintances of the couple declined to discuss their latest holiday schedule with The Mail  on Sunday. While . they have been on Mustique, the island has staged its annual Blues . Festival, organised by Basil Charles and the British singer Dana . Gillespie. Asked if the Duke and Duchess attended, Mr Charles said: ‘I . would not speak about them.’ However, . he added that the event attracted other celebrities, including Ronnie . Wood. The 65-year-old  Rolling Stone cut short his honeymoon with his . third wife, Sally Humphreys, 34, on Sir Richard Branson’s nearby Necker . Island, to jam at the festival. British . publisher Felix Dennis, who owns one of the island’s showiest villas, . Mandalay, also delighted a crowd of 400 one evening. ‘He sang Johnny B. Goode,’ said Mr Charles. Guests: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been joined on the island by the Middleton family (from left: Pippa, James, Carole and Michael) Friends of the villa’s owners  told The Mail on Sunday that the couple are ‘immensely proud’ of their friendship with the Duke  and Duchess. One pal said: ‘They are quite private people and, even though everyone knew they had been invited to Kate and William’s wedding, they didn’t really talk about it much. The impression was that they didn’t want to betray a close friendship.’ A Clarence House spokesman for the Duke and Duchess declined  to comment.","The Duke and Duchess are staying at the £5million house on Mustique .

He spoke out earlier this month to slam Simon Cowell allowing so many children and young wannabes to audition for Britain's Got Talent. But the music mogul used Monday night's live semi final of his ITV1 show to take numerous swipes back at Bruce Forsyth for his comments. Cowell seemed to believe he had proved why children SHOULD be allowed on his shows after some talented youngsters returned to impress the four judges. Scroll down for video . Hitting back: Simon Cowell takes several digs at Bruce Forsyth during Monday night's live semi final of Britain's Got Talent after the Strictly Come Dancing Host complained about the number of children allowed to audition earlier this month . She's Got Talent: When 11-year-old Arisxandra came on stage to sing on Monday, Simon used the opportunity to dedicate it to Bruce after smugly showing off how talented she was . Jibes: Similarly when Essex dance troupe Youth Creation wowed the audience, Cowell couldn't wait to make a jibe at 'grumpy' Bruce for daring to say children shouldn't be allowed to audition . The show is a Saturday night must-see for millions of children. But as far as Sir Bruce Forsyth is concerned, they should remain watching Britain’s Got Talent rather than taking part in it. The 85-year-old TV veteran attacked Simon Cowell for allowing youngsters to take part in his ITV show claiming it is an ‘ordeal’ for many of them and results in many of them crying. ‘I don’t think that’s entertainment,’ he said. ‘I don’t think they should put children on that are too young.’ Sir Bruce, who plans to return as presenter of Strictly Come Dancing – the BBC’s rival to another Cowell show, The X Factor – in the autumn, added: ‘If you’re going to do that, have a separate show. Have a children’s show, British Children Have Talent.’ Although Simon has ignored Bruce's comments and used Monday night's live programme to smugly show off the youngsters on this year's series. Lengthy tenure: Sir Bruce Forsyth has hosted Strictly Come Dancing for 10 years since its inception . When Essex dance troupe Youth Creation returned on stage Simon couldn't wait to take a dig at Forsyth. Branding the TV veteran Mr Grumpy he said: 'Someone, Mr Grumpy, said we shouldn't have children your age on the show so what do you think yes or no you should be here?' The dancers of course screamed yes in unison as they happily got sent on their way with four thumbs up from Simon, David Walliams, Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden. Couldn't decide: The judges couldn't agree on whether to send through Youth Creation or Arisxandra so it was sent it to the public vote . Overcome: 11-year-old Arisxandra became the second act to go through as the judges took their decision to the public vote . Stars in the making: While the rest of contestants were sent home, the two most popular will go through . But Simon took another chance to make a more obvious dig at Bruce later in the show when it was 11-year-old singer Arisxandra's turn to have another audition. The young singer wowed the crowd and judges, even receiving a standing ovation for her talents as she belted out a risky Whitney Houston number. And Cowell made a jibe as soon as he could: 'I think it was one of the best performances of the night and I'd like to dedicate this one to Bruce.' Tough job: After the opening act, the judges looked a little hesitant about what was to come . Dance troupe: Youngsters Youth Creation looked very vibrant in their multi-coloured stage attire . Earlier this month Safer Media, a charity that campaigns for family-friendly media, backed Sir Bruce and called for a ban on children under 16 taking part in TV talent shows. The criticisms emerged as one particular installment of the show saw several acts made up of children – some as young as five. Many were in tears at the end as the pressure of being judged became too much. One young girl in dance troupe Pre-Skool, comprising 13 five to eight-year-olds, started to cry as she waited for the judges to decide whether they would go through to the next round. Stole the show: Arisxandra Libantino blew away the judges as she sang Celine Dion during the first Britain's Got Talent live semifinals on Monday . Emotive performance: 11-year-old Arisxandra silenced the crowd as she started singing . Blown away: Simon admitted that he adored the youngster's performance, singling her out as a frontrunner . Confident performance: Despite her young age, the star in he making had amazing stage presence . Youth Creation, 33 children aged between seven and 14 from Essex also took part, with many of them becoming emotional at the end. Irish teenagers Jack Duff, 13, and Cormac Connell, 14, gave an impressive rendition of Of Monsters and Men’s hit Little Talks but also appeared on the verge of breaking down as they waited for the panel’s verdict. Even Cowell acknowledged their . performance was good but not great because nerves had got the better of . them on the show, which topped TV ratings, attracting more . than ten million viewers – three million more than BBC rival The . Voice. Distressing: Natalie Okri cries during the semi-final of Britain's Got Talent in 2009 after Simon Cowell chooses dance troupe Diversity over her . Not child's play: Singer Hollie Steel breaks down crying half way through her song during Britain's Got Talent in 2009 . ‘People are so careful about using . animals in entertainment and we want to be even more careful about what . we expose children to.’ Scenes of children breaking down in . tears have become all too common on BGT, with Sir Bruce recalling how . one girl of 11 was left in tears. A spokesman for the show said: 'The . welfare of all contestants is our number one priority and we have . stringent procedures in place relating to children who appear in our . programmes. 'Children are accompanied by a member . of their family or a guardian at all times and a psychologist is on . hand at all auditions. 'We also employ registered chaperones at our judges’ audition days and live shows to monitor the children’s welfare. 'As there are a limited number of performances Britain’s Got Talent does not have an age limit.' All too much: A young contestant in tears on Saturday night's show . Feeling the pressure: Dance troupe Pre-Skool looked nervous . Hundreds of viewers complained in . 2009 when two child singers, Hollie Steel and Natalie Okri, cried due to . the pressure of performing live. And last year Britain’s Got Talent . had to defend its lack of an age limit when nine-year-old Malaki Paul . broke down in tears after struggling to finish his song because of . nerves. Last month child welfare campaigners . questioned whether five-year-old Jordan Nash should have been put . through to the next round. While the youngster, from London, received . positive comments from the judges, there were concerns that he is too . young to cope with fame, should he progress to the final stages of the . competition. Jordan, dressed in a black baseball . cap and a T-shirt with his name on it, performed an impressive dance . routine and was given a ‘Yes’ by all four judges.

Up to 3,000 Britons have poured up to £250 million of their savings into a controversial Caribbean property scheme which is facing the threat of legal action. Several investors say they fear financial calamity after being persuaded by pension advisers to put large sums into projects run by Essex-based  Harlequin Property. It has promised to build 6,000 luxury villas in St Lucia, St Vincent, Barbados and the Dominican Republic. So far only 300 have been constructed. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has issued an ‘alert’ about the company and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has been asked to investigate. Big Hitter: Tennis ace Pat Cash's name is used in promotions for the Caribbean property scheme run by Essex-based Harlequin Property, which is now facing legal action . The Mail on Sunday has discovered that: . Harlequin, however, points to its successful developments elsewhere and says its record-keeping is being improved. What they bought: An artists impression of the luxury Merricks Resort in Barbados . What they've got: How the site of the planned Barbados holiday village which drew in millions of pounds in deposits looked last week . David Ames, 61, who runs the company . with wife Carol, also 61, and son Daniel, 35, from a business park in . Basildon, strongly denies misleading investors. He says he has been . duped by contractors which are now the subject of legal action and that . all the projects will eventually be completed. But . Gareth Fatchett, of Regulatory Legal Solicitors, which represents a . group of Harlequin clients, said: ‘We have a serious concerns that the . advice to invest for most investors is seriously flawed. Many people . have invested all their pensions in Harlequin products. We have sent our . lawyers to Barbados and St Vincent to check out the land, accounting . and building progress. On all fronts we have concerns.’ Denial: David Ames who runs Harlequin Property denies misleading investors and says he was duped by contractors . In . October 2011, David Ames announced that work had begun on a ‘show . village’ for a new development, the Merricks Beach Resort, in Barbados. But a Mail on Sunday reporter who visited the site last week found a . plywood sign for a ‘luxury  five-star resort’ mounted in a . rubbish-strewn field. A potholed farm track petered out at a partially . finished guardhouse. ‘I don’t believe this resort will be finished in my lifetime,’ said Clyde Mason, who lives nearby. Businessman . Paul Walton, who released £112,000 from his pension scheme for deposits . on two properties, said: ‘I just can’t see these properties being . built. I feel badly let down by Harlequin because no one is prepared to . give a straight answer.’ The FSA said: ‘We have seen an increasing . number of self-invested personal pension schemes whose underlying . investment is in an overseas property purchased through Harlequin . Property, a UK-based . . . sales agent that is not regulated by the FSA. 'The FSA expects advisers to have undertaken thorough due diligence on . the various developments being sold through Harlequin.’ Arnhim Eustace, a former prime minister of St Vincent, told the Mail on Sunday he had seen a 40-page complaint to the SFO. ‘I have been sent a copy of the submission which I understand was sent to the SFO,’ he said. ‘It is a 40-page document filed on behalf of people who want to get back their money.’ He added that the project also has been plagued by claims that Harlequin built part of the resort on land that it did not own and by complaints that contractors and suppliers have not been fully paid. ‘Two building companies and seven individuals have contacted me to say they were owed money,’ he said. ‘I appealed to Harlequin to pay them but with no result. These are people like a pineapple farmer, owed as little as 1500 (St Vincent ) dollars) for pineapples. He says he was paid only 300.’ A spokesman for Cash said: ‘Harlequin is licensed for a period of time to use the name of the Pat Cash Tennis Academy.’ Liverpool FC did not respond to requests to comment, and a spokesman for Townsend was unavailable.","Investors fear financial ruin after they were persuaded to part with cash .

Each of Tumblr's 178 employees are set to make some serious bank with the website's billion-dollar acquisition by Yahoo!, a new report claims. Tumblr founder David Karp will fatten his wallet with more than $250million, but he's not the only one taking a massive profit from the deal. Behind him, the popular blog site's first 10 employees will collect an average of $6.2million each. The first 30 will make about $3.3million, and the rest will take in about $371,000. Moneymaker: David Karp, who founded Tumblr in . 2007 in his mother's Manhattan apartment, sold the site to Yahoo . for this week for $1.1billion - and he will personally take in a total of more than $250million . Buyer: Yahoo! chief executive Marissa Mayer is pictured at a news conference in New York on Monday, where she officially announced the acquisition . The figures, reported by Crain's New York Business on Tuesday, citing data obtained by research firm PrivCo. On Monday morning, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer publicly announced the purchase with a post on her own Tumblr page - including an animated GIF image that acknowledged the public questions about the acquisition. Her first words about the deal were: 'We promise not to screw it up.' Mayer announced that Karp will stay on as CEO of Tumblr and continue to run and develop the site. Despite a massive user base, Tumblr's revenue was only $13million last year. Even that figure was only made possible after $125million in capital investments. Those investors, including New . York-based Union Square Ventures and Boston's Spark Capital, will take . in $253million and $154million, respectively, according to Crain's. The . deal also faced almost immediate backlash from Tumblr users, who feared . Yahoo!'s ownership would change the character of the site and water . down the features that make it successful. Who is David Karp? Since his company was . acquired for $1.1 billion by Yahoo on Sunday, media outlets have been . clamoring to know more about the boy genius behind Tumblr . Mayer sought to allay concerns on both sides - and even used an internet meme to make light of the criticism. The GIF she posted reads: 'Yahoo. Tumblr. Now Panic and Freak Out.' Mayer urged users and Yahoo! investors alike the 'Keep Calm and Carry On' - a reference to the famous British propaganda poster produced during World War II. Tech news site AllThingsD . reports that Mayer, who took over as Yahoo! CEO in July, wanted to . quickly snatch up Tumblr as 'the stake in the ground of what her . strategy is going forward for Yahoo!' The Tumblr platform manages to blend . elements of all of the major social networking sites. Sharing and . posting photos is simple and easy, like Instagram. GIFs and videos are . all easy to share, as well. But, . the site also has a new feed function, allowing users to follow other . Tumblr blogs like social media networks Facebook and Twitter. Tumblr boasts remarkable loyalty among its users. Some 85 per cent of Tumblr users make 20 or more posts a month. Mayer . cited some of these facts when addressing critics who worried Yahoo! was paying too much for a company that has yet to turn a profit. Deal: Marissa Mayer and Karp pose for a photo at a press conference in New York on Monday announcing the deal . In her Tumblr post, she wrote: 'The combination of Tumblr+Yahoo! could grow Yahoo!’s audience by 50% to more than a billion monthly visitors, and could grow traffic by approximately 20 per cent. 'In terms of working together, Tumblr can deploy Yahoo!’s personalization technology and search infrastructure to help its users discover creators, bloggers, and content they’ll love.' She also addressed the fears of Tumblr users, who threatened to leave the service in droves or to otherwise protest the takeover. 'Tumblr is incredibly special and has a great thing going.  We will operate Tumblr independently.  David Karp will remain CEO,' Mayer wrote. 'The product roadmap, their team, their wit and irreverence will all remain the same as will their mission to empower creators to make their best work and get it in front of the audience they deserve. Yahoo! will help Tumblr get even better, faster.'","Tumblr founder David Karp will make more than $250million in the site's sale to Yahoo!

Mark Bridger tearfully called her  ‘little April’ and insisted he never meant to kill her. As the girl’s sobbing mother fled court, the 47-year-old former slaughterhouse worker insisted he ran April over and bundled her into his car in a panic.

For the first time, he admitted . recalling that he had lain her lifeless body down in front of his . fireplace at his cottage – even though he said he had lost all memory of . how she got there because he was drunk. But he told a jury he did not abduct her, did not have any sexual contact with her and did not murder her. Nor did he have any recollection of . what he did with her body. When he woke up the next morning, he claimed: . ‘I really thought it was a nightmare… then I realised, “this is not a . dream”.’ At one stage April’s mother Coral, . sitting hand in hand with her husband Paul in the  gallery of Mold Crown .

The couple have been in the public gallery throughout . Claims: Bridger says he had drunk so much alcohol after 'crushing' April, five, with his Land Rover (pictured), he could not remember what he did with her body . In the dock: Murder suspect Mark Bridger gripped a tissue as he revealed details of his previous convictions and private life during his trial . In answer to questions from his . defence counsel, Brendan Kelly QC, he rebutted the accusations that he . kidnapped her in a sexually motivated crime, murdered her, disposed of . her body and cleaned up the evidence. He also offered a series of . explanations to the allegations. Evidence: Accused Mark Bridger told the court of his previous offences today to try to prove that he did not abduct and murder April Jones . Blood specks in his bathroom could . have come from washing his fleece after he cradled April’s ‘crushed’ body in his car, he said. The so-called clean-up? ‘I don’t . remember any clean-up, but what I would like to say is if there was . blood dripped, and blood in the bath where I washed my jumper, if I had . seen it, I would have automatically wiped it up. But it was not to try . and hide anything.’ Bone fragments in his wood-burning . stove, he implied, could have come from a chicken meal he cooked his . children – he always threw the bones in the embers. Would he have put . any parts of a human skeleton in the fire? ‘No, no,’ he replied. ‘I . don’t believe I could do that. I really don’t.’ He did now recall laying April down in . front of the fire. The jury heard earlier how a small pool of her blood . was found beneath the carpet there. Earlier the court heard that Bridger, . born in Surrey, moved to Wales after getting his girlfriend pregnant in . the 1980s. He fathered another five children by three more women and had . a string of relationships, at least one involving violent . confrontation. He once threatened a police officer with a machete when they were called to a domestic dispute at his home. Although he told locals he had been in the Army, he now admits he had never served in the military. The Crown says he snatched April the . day his last girlfriend ditched him – and spent the hours beforehand . viewing child porn and images of local girls on his computer. Cross-examining yesterday, Elwen Evans QC asked him: ‘Where is April, Mr . Bridger?’ ‘I don’t know,’ he replied. Later Miss Evans asked him: ‘How . easy do you find it to lie through your teeth?’ ‘Not at all,’ Bridger . replied. ‘I don’t find it easy, no.’ Bridger denies abduction, murder and perverting the course of justice. The trial continues. Trial: Mark Bridger arrives at Mold Crown Court, North Wales today: April Jones disappeared on October 1 last year and despite the biggest search in British criminal history her body has never been found . Mark Bridger's QC Brendan Kelly took the court through the accused's personal life, which produced six children from four different mothers. Mr Kelly began with a three or four year relationship with a woman called Keely Reynolds, with whom he had a son. He was working at a timeshare estate as a barman, chef and waiter, before meeting a new partner. 'I met a young lady I was working with and within three months we were married,' Bridger told the jury. The woman was Julie Wiliams and they lived in mid Wales and also in Wrexham and Chirk. Bridger had two sons from that relationship, now aged 21 and 23, and is still in contact with one of them, he said. Bridger then broke up with Ms Williams but stayed in the Machynlleth area, working as a car recovery mechanic and in a forestry job and began a relationship with a woman called Vanessa Brooks. That lasted for two or three years but there were no children until Bridger met Elaine Griffiths in 1996. 'It was a group of lads, we all hung about together, we all got on and would meet up with groups of girls from different villages and go out dancing,' Bridger said. Elaine had a sister, Karen, who at that time was in a relationship with a man he knew as Paul - the father of April Jones. 'It was through Elaine and Karen I met Paul,' Bridger said. The relationship with Elaine Griffiths lasted eight years until 2003, and they had two children.

Michelle Knight’s disappearance never received the attention that Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus got when they went missing. Following their rescue on Monday, Berry and DeJesus triumphantly returned to their families with public celebrations. Knight is estranged from her family and did not receive the same public welcoming. About two hundred Cleverlanders wearing red ribbons turned out Saturday afternoon to ensure that Knight, 32, does not become the ‘forgotten’ victim of alleged kidnapper Ariel Castro. About two hundred Cleverlanders wearing red ribbons turned out Saturday afternoon to ensure that Michelle Knight, right, does not become the ‘forgotten’ victim of alleged kidnapper Ariel Castro . None of the families who showed up for the march knew Michelle Knight or had even heard of her case before she was rescued from the house on Seymour Avenue on Monday night . ‘We want her to see that we’re here and that the whole city of Cleveland loves her and we’re here for her no matter what,’ Fawn Cassidy, 44, from the city’s West Side, said. Unlike Amanda and Gina, Michelle was an adult when she vanished in 2002. Her mother reported her missing, but police later concluded that she had likely run away after the state took away her baby. Her disappearance prompted no local media coverage and the FBI removed her case from its missing persons database after just 15 months. ‘When she disappeared, at one point, she was forgotten. Nobody knew she was gone. She just got lost in the shuffle,’ Toni Urban, 56, said. Michelle Knight is estranged from her mom Barbara, while Ariel Castro is being held in a Cleveland jail on $8million bail . People walk during a rally for Michelle Knight on Saturday in Cleveland, the sign reads 'Get well Michelle! stay strong! We support you!' None of the families who showed up for the Michelle Knight march knew her or had even heard of her case before she was rescued from the house on Seymour Avenue on Monday night. However, they all said they felt moved by her story – especially her lack of family support. ‘As a mother, I know that this woman needs a family. She needs someone there for her after what happened,’ said Clara Perala. Michelle’s relations with her mother Barbara, who moved to Naples, Florida, are strained. Michelle reportedly did not want her mother visiting her in her hospital room. Barbara has retained a lawyer to fight to see her daughter. Many of the people taking part in the march who MailOnline spoke to said they felt moved by her story ¿ especially her lack of family support . She has also not contacted her great aunt, Deborah, who has been the public face of the Knight family since news about Michelle broke. On Friday Michelle was released from the hospital and reportedly taken to the home of Gina’s parents, Nancy and Felix DeJesus. A neighbor, Lupe Collins, told MailOnline that the DeJesus family was trying to ‘adopt’ Michelle as their own daughter because she and Gina grew so close during their time in captivity. The marchers began at MetroHealth Hospital and walked to Seymour Avenue where they vowed to never again let a missing woman fall through the cracks and be forgotten by the system. The father of kidnapping victim Gina DeJesus, Felix DeJesus, second left, hugs family members outside of their home during his daughter's homecoming on May 8 . Despite the pledge, Cleveland police have revealed in the second district alone – where Castro’s house is – there are currently 71 missing people and only one detective assigned to work missing persons cases. Knight, who was the first captive of the house on Seymour Avenue, was horrifically beaten. She requires facial reconstruction surgery to repair the damage Ariel Castro allegedly inflicted as he bent her to his will. Deborah Knight told the New York Daily News that Michelle was brutally gang raped in high school before she was ever abducted. She had a child from the attack, who was later taken from her be state child protection workers. Well-wishers of Amanda Berry left cards, gifts, balloons - and this young girl even left a bicycle - as a show of support in front of the home of Beth Serrano - Berry's sister .","An estimated 200 Cleveland residents took to the streets on Saturday to give Michelle Knight the homecoming she hadn't previously received .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . UPDATED: . 12:27 EST, 21 February 2012 . Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe marked his 88th birthday today by announcing he was in superb health with the somewhat cryptic declaration: 'I have beaten Christ'. In an interview on state radio, the reviled leader said he was tip-top shape and made no reference to media reports that he is receiving treatment for prostate cancer in Singapore. 'I have died many times,' the devout Catholic said. 'That's where I have beaten Christ. Christ died once and resurrected once. I am as fit as a fiddle.' Divine leader? Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe says he has died more times than Jesus Christ . He joked about reports circulating for years of his imminent demise and vowed to stay in power despite international condemnation of his economic and human rights record. Mugabe charmed world leaders with his wit and intellect in the early years of his rule, when a relatively rich Zimbabwe was praised for its education and social systems. But he has since become a pariah in the West, blamed for running the economy into the ground and for massive human rights abuses to keep his grip on power. Mugabe, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, said his party ZANU-PF would choose his successor at the right time, but he had no intention of stepping down for now. Determined: Mugabe tucks into a cake to celebrate his 84th birthday in 2008 when he formally launched his re-election campaign . 'Our members of the party will certainly select someone once I say I am now retiring, but not yet,' he said in a separate interview with state TV. 'At this age, I can still go some distance, can't I,' Mugabe said, laughing, clapping his hands and rocking in his chair. Asked whether his party still had anything more to offer after more than three decades in power, Mugabe said ZANU-PF's signature policies remained the defence of political independence and the pursuit of black economic empowerment. Critics say ZANU-PF has helped ruin one of Africa's most promising economies with its seizures and distribution of white-owned commercial farms, and its more recent drive to force foreign-owned firms to transfer majority shareholdings to Zimbabweans. Religious: The devout Catholic (back right) attends the funeral of Pope John Paul II at the Vatican with Prince Charles (back left) and other world leaders in 2005 . Mugabe has shared power with his long-time foe, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, over the last three years after violent and disputed elections in 2008. Mugabe has been nominated as ZANU-PF party's candidate and intends to run in an election he wants held this year. That would be a year ahead of schedule under the power-sharing deal which also calls for a new constitution to be drawn up and approved ahead of the poll. 'It's not a secret that there is grumbling in the party over his decision to go on and on, but those seeking to succeed him are not strong enough to challenge him,' said Eldred Masunungure, a political science professor at the University of Zimbabwe. Once admired: Mugabe (pictured with a giant can of baked beans on his head in 1990) charmed world leaders with his wit and intellect in the early years of this reign, but has since become a pariah in the West . 'They are stuck with him for better or worse, and the attitude in ZANU-PF appears to be - lets hope for the best,' Masunungure said. A June 2008 U.S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks last year said Mugabe had prostate cancer that had spread to other organs. His doctor urged him to step down in 2008, according to the cable. Mugabe, who has ruled the southern African state since its independence from Britain in 1980, chaired a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Presidential officials said he would celebrate his birthday at a family dinner at his home in Harare. ZANU-PF is planning a celebration rally in eastern Zimbabwe on Saturday.","Zimbabwe President claims he's 'fit as a fiddle'

Six days after police kicked in the front door of 2207 Seymour Avenue in Cleveland to rescue Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, a construction crew nailed boards over the windows and doors to close it off. Police erected a barricade around Ariel Castro’s home on Saturday and barricaded it closed so that they could re-open the street, which has been closed since Monday night when Amanda Berry broke out and called police after a decade in captivity. Police will continue to watch the house of horrors 24 hours a day after furious Cleveland residents threatened to burn it to the ground. House of horror: Workers board up 2207 Seymour Avenue, the house where Ariel Castro is allegedly to held three women captive for nearly a decade . City Councilman Brian Cummings told Fox 8 news in Cleveland that officers have received repeated arson threats against the property. However, police still want to keep the house intact so they can continue collecting evidence against Castro, who is accused of kidnapping Berry, DeJesus and Knight, brutally beating them and repeatedly raping them for a decade until they were freed on Monday. The house will eventually be surrounded by a 10-foot-high fence, as well. Curious Clevelanders from across the city streamed onto the Seymour Avenue to catch a glimpse of the world-infamous house. Susan McLaughlin, 53, and her daughter were in downtown Cleveland from the suburbs to taste wedding cakes and decided to make a short detour to check out the Seymour Avenue house. Workers unload materials to board up Ariel Castro's home in Cleveland, Ohio, and help protect it from locals who want to destroy it . Castro, 52, is accused of kidnapping Berry, DeJesus and Knight, brutally beating them and repeatedly raping them for a decade. He is being held in a Cleveland jail on $8million bail . ‘We just came down to say a little prayer,’ Ms McLaughlin said as she strained to see the barricade home. ‘Everybody in the city is talking about it and we wanted to see it.’ She also wanted to address a question many Clevelanders had for the Ariel's neighbors. 'I wanted to see how close the houses were together. How it was possible that someone could be right next door to this for years and not ever hear anything or suspect anything was going on.' Police still want to keep the house, third from right, intact so they can continue collecting evidence against Castro, who is accused of kidnapping Berry, DeJesus and Knight . Ariel’s son Anthony Castro told MailOnline his father painted over the windows of the house and kept doors to the basement, the attic and the garage locked, even when Ariel’s wife and children lived there 20 years ago. Police say the front door was barricaded shut when Amanda Berry forced her way out on Monday and shocked the world with a 911 call announcing she was still alive after she went missing in 2003.

The show will run for 265 episodes, with each one being accompanied by a short narration related to the different species, including the Nightingale . To a younger audience, the title may seem somewhat misleading. But BBC Radio 4’s new programme, Tweet of the Day, will not have anything to do with social networking site Twitter, it will be a daily broadcast of birdsong. Veteran wildlife expert David Attenborough is among a number of presenters who will host the series which will feature a 90-second recording of a different bird each day. Beginning on May 6th, it will run for 265 episodes, with each one being accompanied by a short narration related to the different species, including the Cuckoo, Nightingale, Tawny Owl and Storm Petrel. The series, which is being made by the BBC’s Natural History Unit, will be broadcast every weekday morning at 05.58am, just before the flagship current affairs show, the Today programme. One of the episodes will be repeated on Sunday mornings at 08.58am. Attenborough will present every episode of the series in May, while other wildlife presenters including Steve Backshall, Miranda Krestovnikov and Chris Packham will then take over the role. Scripted by BBC presenter and wildlife expert Brett Westwood, each episode will feature information about each particular bird’s behaviour and habits, as well as its literary and folklore associations. The first episode will feature the Cuckoo, with Attenborough explaining: ‘I’m sure all of us can recognise this bird from its song. But how many of us can  say that we have actually seen the bird itself? ‘It is perhaps no surprise then that William Wordsworth wrote; “Shall I call thee bird? Or but a wandering voice?”’ Sir David Attenborough will be explaining about some species of birds as part of the soothing programme . Attenborough then goes on to explain the migrating habits of the species. The 86-year-old said of the new programmes: ‘I’m delighted to be involved in this series. I’ve seen some of the most incredible animals on my travels around the world, but Tweet of the Day is a nice reminder of the teeming world of birds on my doorstep. As a non-ornithologist, I might even learn a little too.’ Every episode of Tweet of the Day will be available to download, while the programme’s website will include behind-the-scenes features on how the recordings were made. The announcement comes four years after a cult radio station, which broadcast nothing but the sound of birdsong, was axed, prompting an outcry among fans. Birdsong Radio had attracted an estimated 500,000 listeners, including the author Sir Terry Pratchett. It played a 20 minute-long recording of birds singing in chorus, which was repeated on a continuous loop from 6am every day until midnight. However, it was cancelled in 2009 to make way for Amazing Radio, a station which plays a mix of indie, urban, rock and jazz music by unsigned artists. The decision caused outrage among its fans, who flooded forums and websites calling to have the programme reinstated.","Every episode of Tweet of the Day will be available to download .

The full sunny glare of Mother Nature ensures the world is aware of Simon Cowell’s jowls. In TV land, however, he appears to have lost ten years. The music mogul happily admits to using weird and wonderful treatments to make himself look more youthful. But the Mail can reveal the secret of his vanishing jowls on Britain’s Got Talent at the weekend owed more to electrical engineers and strategic studio lighting. Let there be light: The four lamps can be seen in front of Cowell on the BGT judges' table. Amanda Holden has none . The 53-year-old insists that no fewer than four extra lamps are focused on him as he sits on the judging panel of the ITV talent show. These help fill in the shadows that might otherwise be cast by set lighting and help make his face look smooth and firm. In contrast, fellow judges Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and David Walliams are said to sit in relative gloom. During last weekend’s show, fans inundated Twitter with comments about Cowell’s appearance. Even Alan Sugar tweeted a question to Cowell on behalf of his wife, asking: ‘My wife and her friend Joy want to know what you have done to your face?’ Cowell has often spoken about his battle to stay young. The multi-millionaire recently admitted that he completes hundreds of . press-ups a day, work-outs four times a week, regularly uses  Botox and . colonic irrigation treatments, and even has vitamin injections . administered by a nurse in a bit to maintain his youthful appearance. Last summer Cowell was forced to deny speculation that he’d had a neck . lift to tighten up the skin around his chin after he was photographed in . Los Angeles with a plaster behind his ear. At the time, a spokesman for . Cowell insisted that the star has cut himself by accident. He also revealed that he uses a £10.95 lemon bath milk, which he says he uses daily to help soften and perfume his skin. Cowell looks smooth and youthful on screen (left) but those jowls appear in their full glory off set (right) Asked about rumours that he does 500 press-ups a day, he said: ‘It’s all true. I mean, not 500 push-ups, but several hundred. ‘I . work out three or four times a week, I have Botox, take tons of . vitamins and vitamin infusions - if you believe that these things work, . you will feel better.’ Perhaps the most usual of his beauty treatments is a sheep placenta facial, which he is said to have regularly. It . involves having his skin exfoliated for 30 minutes at the beginning of . the process, before a bright LED light is directed at his face to open . his pores. A beauty professional then applies the placenta which is mixed with 24 carat gold flakes and comes in the form of a gel. The multi-millionaire recently admitted he does hundreds of press-ups a day, regularly uses Botox and colonic irrigation treatments, vitamin injections – and even facials using sheep placenta.","Fellow Britain's Got Talent judges don't use extra lamps on set .

Green life: Ralph Hoare, pictured with one of his helpful great-granddaughters in his garden, is Britain's oldest gardener turning 105 this year . Despite weak knees he refuses to give up his passion, securing the help of his great-grandchildren aged four and six, to prune his plants. The former bank worker and RAF veteran took up gardening in 1914, aged six, and is now set to share almost a century of experience with the Twitter generation. After he was identified as the UK's oldest active gardener by retailer Furniture Village he is to become an online expert on nation's horticultural questions on the social network. The former bank worker and RAF veteran will answer questions posted with the hashtag #askralph from tomorrow, inbetween tending to his own garden and planning for his 105th birthday party in July. Flower power: Ralph has a passion for roses and his garden is home to over 200 varieties, as well as his vegetable patches where he grows potatoes, onions and broccoli . Mr Hoare said:‘The thought of my garden in bloom gives me the willpower to continue through the winter. ‘Gardening keeps me on the move and my mind active.’ ‘The seed potatoes are sprouting in the spare bedroom and I am waiting for some dry weather for the onion sets.’ Veteran: Ralph, pictured with his mother in a garden as a young child, has been gardening since he was six years old .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:07 EST, 2 December 2011 . Apple today insisted that its iPhone voice activation app is 'pro-life' and that refusal to find abortion clinics is merely a technical glitch. The technology giant had under fire from American civil liberty campaigners after bloggers testing out Siri discovered it replies blankly when asked for information on terminations and birth control. The omission stood in contrast to iPhone 4GS users  who got responses when asking for phone numbers of the nearest shooting range. But Apple today insisted, it was not a political stance. 'These are not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone,' a spokesman told the New York Times. Scroll down for video... Is it just a glitch? Siri has been accused of withholding details on contraception and abortion . Working: But Siri can still tell you where to find strippers, or breast implants . 'It simply . means that as we bring Siri from beta to a final product, we find places . where we can do better, and we will in the coming weeks' One of Siri’s creators, Norman Winarsky, believes the problem may lie with the web services the California firm has partnered with, claiming that ‘Apple probably hasn't paid much attention to all the results that come up’. Whatever the reason, it has led to the launching of a petition, by the American Civil Liberties Union. The group have asked Apple to fix the 'glitch' so that it can help people find the 'reproductive resources' that they need. The ACLU wrote in a blog post: 'According to numerous sources, when asked to find an abortion clinic, even in areas where such clinics are nearby, Siri either draws a blank, or worse, refers women to pregnancy crisis centres. Claims: Siri, on the iPhone 4s, has been accused of being 'Pro-life' 'As we've blogged about in the past, pregnancy crisis centres, which often bill themselves as resources for abortion care, do not provide or refer for abortion. 'They are notorious for providing false and misleading information about abortion. Siri users with foreign accents have struggled to make the app understand them. When it was first released, those iPhone 4s owners said the software was 'almost useless'. Scottish users in particular were left frustrated, and took to the web to complain. In one video, a Scottish voice can be . heard asking Siri 'Gonnae no dae that', with the phone replying . believing the person to have said 'Going Akila'. 'Further, if you'd like to avoid getting pregnant, Siri isn't much use, either. When asked where one can find birth control, apparently Siri comes up blank.' There are several theories as to the origin of the 'glitch'. Some bloggers have questioned whether the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs programmed it into Siri. Jobs, who was adopted at birth, once expressed his enormours gratitude to his biological mother for giving him birth rather than having him aborted. But others believe it may be down to the deals Apple signs with the web services that generate the results. Norman Winarksy, one of the founders of Siri before it was bought out by Apple in 2010, told the New York Times: 'At its core, Siri works by translating a spoken request into text, singling out keywords and then using various Web services to suggest answers. 'Those answers would be coming from the Web services that Siri is connecting to, not necessarily Apple. 'My guess at what’s happening here is that Apple has made deals with Web services that provide local business information, and Apple probably hasn’t paid much attention to all the results that come up.'","App 'refuses' to provide details of abortion clinics .

An elderly tortoise called Adolf has cheated death yet again - 71 years after he survived a Nazi bomb attack in the Second World War. Carey and David Miller, of Muswell Hill, north London, feared their pet reptile had died after he was caught outside in a freezing late snowfall in their garden as they visited their son abroad. The shell of the stricken tortoise, who is thought to be more than 100 years old, was finally discovered and he was taken inside to safety by the couple’s shocked eight-year-old grandson Jake. Worried: Carey Miller (pictured), of Muswell Hill, north London, feared her pet tortoise Adolf had died after he was caught outside in a freezing late snowfall in their garden as she visited her son abroad . Adolf remained in their home, without a hint of life for the next month. But the Millers took him out into the sunshine last Sunday in a last desperate bid to see if the spring warmth would revive him. ‘We thought he was dead,’ children’s author Mrs Miller said. ‘Adolf was totally inert. We thought that was it. It was only on Sunday that we took him out of the box and his head gradually came out. ‘We were absolutely ecstatic to see that he was still alive.’ His recovery comes after the Millers were told he was discovered crawling in a crater caused by a Nazi parachute mine bomb. The blast destroyed three houses in 1942 in Wood Green, north London. The gutsy tortoise was adopted by the neighbours and named William, remaining happily with them until the Millers bought the house 35 years ago. Happy again: Adolf recovers from his winter ordeal (left) with his very own wartime Nazi helmet, 71 years after he was discovered crawling in a crater caused by one of Adolf Hitler's (right) Nazi parachute mine bombs . They renamed him Adolf in honour of surviving the wartime bombing blitz and he became a much-loved family pet, entertaining their three children and, more recently, eight grandchildren. 'We thought he was dead. We thought that was it. We were absolutely ecstatic to see that he was still alive' Carey Miller, Adolf's owner . But Adolf has gone missing from his back garden four or five times and once ended up in Highgate after a well-meaning cleaning lady decided to take him home after finding him out in the street. Mrs Miller said: ‘He went absolutely ballistic, bashing against the fence in Highgate and she was quite worried about him. But we finally tracked him down.’ And on another occasion Adolf thought he had found a good place for a nap, only to be woken up as the bonfire looming above him was lit. ‘My husband set fire to him accidentally - he lost a huge lump from his shell,’ Mrs Miller said.","Carey and David Miller feared pet had died after being caught outside .

Royal officials have submitted a secret planning application for substantial changes at the Norfolk mansion the Queen is reportedly planning to gift to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council is being asked to approve plans to re-route the existing driveway in order to make it more private as well as construct a new garden room at Grade II listed Anmer Hall on her private Sandringham Estate. The application, which is described as a ‘major development’ in council papers, also involves converting a wood store into accommodation – which could be used for police guarding the couple - and extending an existing garage block to form an equipment room. Country pile: Anmer Hall is a late Georgian country house which sits in . the grounds of the Sandringham estate and is just two miles east of the . Queen's Sandringham House . Charming: The Duke spent much of his childhood holidays exploring the Grade II listed house, pictured . The application was submitted by the . Sandringham estate office on behalf of the Queen on December 10 last . year, but details were only revealed today. Earlier this week it was reported . that the 10 bedroom residence was being lined up by the monarch as a . country home for Kate and William, who are expecting their first child. News of the new planning application . will only heighten such speculation, particularly as attempts have been . made to shroud it in secrecy. Drawings and detail of the plans are not being revealed on the council’s website for security reasons in the normal way. Sprawling estate: The royal couple are expected to be given the country house by the Queen . Anmar Hall was lived in by the Duke and Duchess of Kent from 1972 to 1990 and is now leased to James Everett . A planning application has been submitted to the council to make changes to the Georgian property . Couple: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pictured as the Duchess left hospital after a severe bout of morning sickness. The couple are currently based in Kensington Palace, West London . The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh stay at Sandringham every Christmas with the rest of the Royal family . And anyone who wants to see the plans . has to be vetted by the police first and can only view them at the . council offices in the presence of a planning officer. A decision on whether to approve the . plans is set to be made by council officers using delegated powers . sometime before March 11,  instead of local councillors. Residents in the tiny village of . Anmer have been informed of the application, but no objections have been . listed on the council’s website. Anmer Hall is one of the 150 . properties owned by the Queen on her 20,000 acre estate in north Norfolk . and is only two miles east of Sandringham House. It is surrounded by estate farmland, giving William and Kate a high level of privacy as they gear up to start their own family. It is believed that the couple want to change the driveway to give them more privacy and improve access to the hall. At the moment the main entrance to . the hall is about 100 yards down a tiny lane which is also used as a . public road to St Mary the Virgin Church, where services are held twice a . month. Anmer Hall which largely dates back . to 1802 was one of the houses where Prince Charles and his then mistress . Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall, used to enjoy . secret trysts, when it was rented by the prince’s friend Hugh van . Cutsem. William spent many childhood holidays playing in the grounds with the van Cutsem boys, who are all close friends. It was earlier leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house from 1972 until 1990. The current tenant is James Everett, . who owns a kitchen and timber company, and has leased the property until . 2017, which means William and Kate’s son or daughter would be three . years old when then move in. The village of Anmer lies between King's Lynn and Hunstanton, on the edge of the Sandringham estate . Details of picturesque Anmar Hall (pictured) but anyone who wants to see the plans submitted to the council has to be vetted by the police . The village of Anmer has no pub or . shop and had a population of just 63 in the 2001 census, but it has a . social club which is open on Friday evenings and Saturday lunchtimes. The club is home to darts and . dominoes teams and is the headquarters of the Anmer Mere Yacht Club, . which has a Latin motto translating as 'Never make me sail'. Villager Neville Warnes, 82, who has . lived in Anmer for 74 years and has been in the hall several times, . said: ""I can't think that it would be anything other than good for the . village. 'It's nice inside. It's got lovely . frontage, facing south, and it's homely. It's got quite a lot of . grounds. That's an ideal place for them to live and rear a family. 'It's isolated but surrounding the . hall is the park where the child, or the children, will see the cattle, . the sheep and get a general feeling of the countryside and rural life.' Karen Melhado, who moved to the village from York in 2007, described the prospect of Royal neighbours as 'absolutely wonderful'. She added: 'I would not move back to a town now I live here in Anmer. It's beautiful here all year round. 'Everybody gets on with everybody and . it would be nice if they would participate in some of the things that . go on in the village. 'I would make them very welcome and I'm sure other people in the village would as well.' William and Kate currently live in a . rented farmhouse on Anglesey, where the prince is an RAF Search and . Rescue helicopter pilot. When they are not on Anglesey, they . live at Nottingham Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace in West . London, which has just one bedroom and has been described as ‘cosy’. However later this year they will . move into the newly renovated Apartment 1A inside the palace itself, . which was Princess Margaret’s home, while Prince Harry will have the . cottage. Picturesque: An aerial view of the country house owned by the Queen in Norfolk . The new apartment will suit the couple’s growing family, as it boasts five bedrooms and three reception rooms. The Sandringham Estate has been owned by the Queen since her accession in 1952 and by the Royal Family since 1862. Although much of the land is open to . the public, the paparazzi are no longer allowed to photograph the Royal . family relaxing there – making Anmer Hall even more of an attractive . proposition to the Duke and Duchess. Buckingham Palace has declined to comment. A spokeswoman for King’s Lynn and .

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made a surprise appearance at their office Christmas party this afternoon. The couple’s choice of venue for their annual Household bash was not, however, The Ritz or some other glitzy high-end venue - but a local London restaurant chain. William and Kate turned up with minimal fuss to Bumpkin in Notting Hill, where they had hired, appropriately, The Queen’s Room, (so called because of a giant frame portrait of the monarch, the prince’s grandmother, which hangs from the wall. Surprise: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured earlier this month, made an appearance at their office party despite Kate being in hospital . Low-key: The party was not held at a glitzy venue, but at the Bumpkin restaurant in Notting Hill, London . Country in the city: The restaurant is a group across London serving rustic British food . The Duchess, who was wearing a stylish floral blue and white dress with a smart matching jacket, tucked into the restaurant traditional Christmas Menu which costs just £30 for three courses and features free-range turkey with the all the trimmings and traditional Christmas pudding. Although the mulled wine was said to be flowing, the pregnant Duchess, unsurprisingly, stuck to soft drinks. Both she and her husband appeared to be enjoying themselves immensely, sources said. A restaurant source added: ‘The Duchess of Cambridge was looking the picture of health. William and Kate enjoyed a leisurely lunch with 27 members of their Household. ‘Bumpkin is a group of country-in-the-city style restaurants serving rustic British food. ‘It seems even the Royals attend office Christmas parties - although it was a much more sophisticated affair, without all the usual drunken antics and revelry.’ Recovery: The Duchess' appearance was the second since she was released from hospital on December 6, the first being her surprise appearance at the Sports Personality of the Year Awards . A St James Palace spokesman confirmed the couple’s attendance saying: ‘The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a private luncheon today.’ The event was the Duchess’s second outing since being released from hospital on December 6, the first being her surprise appearance at the Sports Personality of the Year Awards on Sunday night. The fact that Kate, 30, who was hospitalised for three days earlier this month after being diagnosed with an acute form of morning sickness, felt well enough to attend suggests that she is well on the road to recovery. Doctors have, however, warned her condition can recur at any time. Sports personality: The Duchess of Cambridge spent three nights in hospital before making an appearance at the awards ceremony on Sunday . It also means that she is likely to . attend both the Queen’s private Christmas lunch for her extended family, . which is being held at Buckingham Palace tomorrow, as well as the . traditional celebrations at Sandringham at Christmas. The Duchess, who is less than 12 weeks pregnant, has been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition which causes severe vomiting pregnant women. The illness is thought to be caused by elevated levels of the ‘pregnancy hormone’ hCG, which the body begins to produce after conception. Get well soon: The Duchess was taken to the King Edward VII hospital earlier this month after being diagnosed with an acute form of morning sickness . It can cause such severe sickness and nausea that sufferers become dehydrated and can even vomit blood. The condition tends to appear at around six to eight weeks into pregnancy and for most sufferers disappears towards the end of the first trimester. But for some it can go on as long as five months into the pregnancy and, occasionally, right until birth. Kate was said to be severely dehydrated when she was admitted to hospital and spent three nights under the care of doctors at the King Edward V11 Hospital, for the most part being fed fluids and nutrients via an intravenous drip.","Couple held annual Household bash at London restaurant chain Bumpkin .

But Kate, who is five months pregnant, said Prince William would prefer to have a girl. The Duchess made the revelations while speaking to a soldier during the couple's visit to Mons Barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire, for a St Patrick's Day parade. Girl or a boy? Kate told a soldier during a St Patrick's Day parade that she is hoping to have a son, while Prince William wants a daughter . After the parade the couple chatted to soldiers from the 1st Battalion Irish Guards. Guardsman Lee Wheeler, 29, said: 'I was talking to her about the baby, of course. 'I asked her ""do you know if it’s a girl or boy"", and she said ""not yet"". 'She said ""I’d like to have a boy and William would like a girl"". That’s always the way. 'I asked her if she had any names yet and she said no. 'I said I suppose you’ve got to stick to traditional names.' Guardsman Jason Perry, 33, also spoke to the Duchess about her pregnancy. He said: 'I wished her congratulations and said I hoped everything is fine. She said ""yes it is"". 'I asked her if she was excited to be having her first child. She said ""very"".' The soldier said it was 'absolutely . brilliant' to meet the couple and they had both asked him about his . 13-and-a-half year career in the Army, which has seen him serve two . tours of Iraq and one in Northern Ireland. William, who wore the ceremonial dress . of the Irish Guards, sipped on a glass of sherry inside the dining hall . at the Guardsmens' cookhouse, while the pregnant Duchess went without a drink. Tradition: Prince William attended the Parade as Colonel of the Regiment, and the Duchess presented the traditional sprigs of shamrocks to the officers and guardsmen of the regiment . Shamrock: Prince William wore the sprigs on his cap and then had a drink of sherry in the regiment hall . The pair were loudly cheered by the . soldiers as they entered the hall, which gave them welcome shelter from . the heavy rain outside. Last month, speculation on the sex of the baby went into overdrive when the Duchess appeared to suggest the couple were having a girl. Before going inside, the Duke and Duchess had put on a brave face as they posed for formal photographs with officers and sergeants in the torrential rain. The wet weather had earlier held off as the royal couple watched the parade take place under the cover of a podium. Under grey skies, the Duchess took her position next to the Duke, who was attending the event as Colonel of the Regiment and for the first time wore an insignia aide de camp to the Queen on his shoulder, which was bestowed on him today. Irish celebration: Kate smiles widely and Prince William sports a shamrock in his cap as they talk to soldiers . Meet and greet: The Duchess of Cambridge was given bunch of flowers during the visit to the barracks . The couple looked on as about 200 . soldiers paraded through the puddle-strewn square, bringing a splash of . colour to the occasion in their full ceremonial uniform of scarlet . tunics and bearskins, and led by the Band of the Irish Guards. Kate, who had her hair up, wore an elegant black hat with a felt flower and a patriotic green coat to mark St Patrick's Day. She finished off her outfit with black tights and heels. The Duke watched as she presented traditional sprigs of shamrock to the officers and guardsmen, including one to himself. Many of the soldiers who received the sprigs wore them in the front of their caps, as did the Duke, while Kate attached one to her lapel, next to a shamrock brooch. The last sprig was given to the regiment’s new mascot, seven-month-old Irish wolfhound Domhnall, who was carrying out his first public engagement.","The Duchess of Cambridge told a soldier she is hoping for a boy .

Dramatic: The stunning shots - which show a number of sharks hurtling through the waves while hunting - were captured by wildlife photographer Chris McLennan . Caught: The tail of the decoy hangs from between the jaws of this huge shark as it launched itself from the deep. The power of its attack can be seen from the spray that surrounds it . Flight: The great white hurtles through the air, demonstrating the species' incredible power and strength - and showing why they are among the world's most feared predators . The waters around Seal Island are a key hunting ground for one of the world's most feared - and misunderstood - predators. Mr McLennan spotted 28 hits on the decoy seal by hungry Great Whites as he waited with his camera poised. The images show the sharks flying three to four feet clear of the water with the decoy in their mouths, demonstrating the incredible speed and power they use while hunting. The great white shark's have been known to grow to up to 20ft in length and can weigh 5,000 lb. The species reaches full maturity at around 15 years of age and can have a life span of over 30 years. Due to their portrayal in a number of films, great whites have been demonised as relentless 'man-eaters' - where as in reality humans are a long way down their list of favoured prey. Doomed: In this attack a real young seal's body can be seen hanging limply from the shark's mouth as it crashes through the surface of the water .

Extra checks: Fears have been raised over the documents presented by foreign nurses to get jobs in British hospitals (file picture) An NHS watchdog has imposed a recruitment freeze on foreign nurses amid fears that workers could have faked documents to get jobs in British hospitals. Nursing regulators admit they do not know how many immigrant workers could have fraudulently secured frontline health positions after faking evidence of their qualifications, experience or identity. The freeze means that around 160 nurses are being prevented from filling vacancies in already stretched NHS units, while the Nursing and Midwifery Council conducts the urgent investigation into its own failings. The astonishing disclosure comes after a week in which the regulator was heavily criticised by MPs. It raises major concerns for patient safety and casts doubt on whether the watchdog is fit for purpose. Officials at the NMC told The Mail on Sunday that there were concerns over whether documents submitted by job applicants could be verified as genuine, and in some cases  whether they had been accurately translated into English. The problems emerged during an internal review, which began last month. And although it has not yet found any fraudulent documents, the NMC has been unable to confirm that no false applications have been made. A spokeswoman admitted: ‘The quality of the information supplied in some cases is not proof of fraud but does not give us the level of confidence we would want.’ Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, is demanding an explanation, saying: ‘The NMC’s main job is to protect the public. It would seem that it is having problems doing this. We are naturally concerned that the NMC has felt a need to stop registering foreign nurses. They are an important addition to the NHS, but public protection is the most important issue.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘I congratulate the NMC on being transparent over this issue because it has huge implications. The public will be concerned to hear the regulator telling us they can’t guarantee foreign nurses’ paperwork is genuine. ‘If supermarkets can check these kinds of documents before employing someone, why can’t the NMC?’ Protection: Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal college of Nursing has demanded an explanations and said that the Nursing and Midwifery Council's purpose is to protect patients . The NMC regulates nurses and midwives and maintains a register of all of those who are approved to work in British clinics and hospitals. It approves around 1,000 applications a year from nurses coming from outside the European Union. It also investigates bad practice and has the power to strike nurses off the register. However, it has recently been criticised for failing to maintain an accurate register, so some nurses were cleared to work even though they were being disciplined or investigated. The NMC suspended the overseas register in early February and will not reopen it until at least April 2. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We aware that the NMC is currently undertaking a review of its overseas registration process. We expect it to quickly identify any weaknesses in its system and take firm action to ensure patient safety is fully protected.’ Last week, the NMC was criticised by the powerful Commons Health Select Committee for ‘failing to properly prioritise patient safety’ by not enforcing  enough checks that nurses had a good grasp of English.","Freeze means 160 nurses prevented from filling NHS vacancies .

The 30-year-old pilot, part of a four-man team based at RAF Valley in Anglesey, is shown rescuing a teenage boy who has fallen 20ft from a disused railway bridge. When the victim is found, difficult flying conditions leave the Prince with a decision over whether to risk a landing or winch the teenager to safety. He said: ‘It’s not easy. It makes you feel worried, concerned. You obviously want to make the right call. I have a duty of care for the crew and for the casualty. So you  do have to think very carefully. ‘When you have got either a young child or a young woman or a young man or an old man or whatever it is you are going to.

It seems veteran Fox News reporter Geraldo Rivera follows the maxim 'If at first you don't succeed, try, try again,' particularly when it comes to dealing with Occupy Wall Street protesters. On Sunday evening, Mr Rivera waded into a crowd of protesters along with his camera crew and some body guards, flashing his trademark grin. He even went so far as to high-five some supporters. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . All smiles: At first, Fox reporter Geraldo Rivera was getting along with protesters, even going up to high-five an attendee . The attack: Viewers can see the man in the centre witha yellow and blue hat pouring a package of unidentified white powder on Mr Rivera's head . It seemed like a much warmer welcome than he was given on his first trip down to the Zuccoti Park protest, when he was heckled and appeared to leave due the area as a result. Not missing a beat, Mr Rivera wiped off the powder, brushed back his hair, and turned the incident around. Shake it off: Mr Rivera immediately brushes the substance off his head . 'You have a point, you have momentum,' he said to the crowd. 'Don't let the jerks steal your momentum.'The powder incident didn't leave Mr Rivera as flustered as his previous trip to the protest. When he went to report on Occupy Wall Street last Wednesday, he was immediately met with chants saying 'Fox News lies!' and ushering him away from the crowds. Though video footage certainly makes it seem like he was shying away from the angry crowd, Mr Rivera posted otherwise on his blog. First time around: Rivera was trying to talk to protesters when crowds recognised him and started chanting 'Na na na na, hey hey hey, Goodbye!' 'Their chants did not send us packing,' the blog said. 'In fact, through the crowd's chanting, we completed the remaining two topics and five interviews. Then, 12 minutes later, having covered all the topics planned and interviewed all the guests invited on the program, coming back on camera from an edited piece on the similarities between Casey Anthony and Amanda Knox, Geraldo delivered (a) wrap to close the show.'This is not the first skirmish the Mr Rivera has dealt with in his years on the job.

Berlin's disaster airport BER - running millions in overspend and years behind schedule - has suffered a new embarrassing snag after management bosses admitted this week that they can't turn the lights off. Three hundred workers are employed at the biggest construction site in the country trying to put right the airport meant to be the most advanced in the world. But no-one is able to cut the power to thousands of lights burning at least £2,000 worth of electricity every 12 hours in the main terminal hall. Spot the problem: At least £2,000 every 12 hours are thought to be being wasted on lights at BER Airport . Directing traffic: Some lights at the airport are obviously useful - but others are just draining money . 'We are not so far advanced that we can control the lighting,' said Horst Amann, in charge of the technological side of the project which has made Berlin a laughing stock. 'It is true that deficiencies in the control system currently affect the terminal lighting', said a spokesman for the airport company. But he said the lights would be left on at night anyway 'for security reasons.' Berlin is currently served by two other airports, Tegel and Schoenefeld, both of which are now pouring millions into upgrades as most experts believe BER won't be operating until 2017 at the earliest. Ongoing saga: The airport is years behind schedule and has almost doubled its budget . It was supposed to open last year. The cost of the project has almost doubled from its original estimate - from £1.7bn to £3.7bn. It is expected, when the problems are resolved and the airport is open for business, 27 million customers can be catered for. It has a list of 20,000 things that need to be put right - from fire extinguishers that don't work to doors that won't open...and now lights that won't switch off.","Airport is already years behind schedule and massively overspent its budget .

A coach driver has admitted causing the deaths of two men killed in a horrific motorway crash after he parked on a carriageway moments before a lorry ploughed into it.

Lorry driver William Mapstone, from Wells in Somerset, died in hospital after the collision, while a passenger on the Volvo coach, Liaquat Ali, also suffered fatal injuries. Dhesi, 50, was driving along the . inside lane of the southbound M5, near Frankley Services, in thick fog . when he started having problems with the single-decker bus he was . driving. A court heard he continued on with his journey regardless - despite the vehicle only being able to reach a top speed of 26mph.

The Chinese manufacturer who made the USA's Olympics uniform has hit back over criticism at it being produced overseas, questioning whether America would be capable of anything comparable. Li Guilian, who owns Dayang Trands, pointed to the cheaper cost of labour and materials in China, which allows the country to sell affordable clothes to the US. She demanded credit for her workers, who earn between $6,300 to $9,500 a year and advised officials to 'pay attention to the performances of the U.S. athletes and not their clothes'. The method of production for the Ralph Lauren designs has caused controversy but the Chinese company director says there is no way the US could recreate the work on home ground . Ms Guilian worked her way up from sewing aprons to owning the $300 million company, which makes five million suits a year, including designs for all-American labels DKNY and Banana Republic. Chinese President Hu Jintao and billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are customers at the 66-year-old's firm, and former President George H.W. Bush was once seen in one of the company's suits. Power dressing: Billionaires including Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have worn suits made by Dayang Trangs . It has now manufactured the Olympic team’s Ralph Lauren blazers, berets and slacks, triggering a fierce debate over economic policy on how much manufacturing should be sent abroad. Members of Congress were fuming over the . matter earlier this month, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid demanding that the Olympic . committee 'burn them and start all over again.' 'I have a simple question,' Ms Guilian told the Los Angeles Times. 'Can America really make the suits we make? We have cheaper costs here so you can have cheaper prices in America.' 'Don't you think we deserve credit?. We've made so many customers happy over the years.' American labour legislation prevents employers from paying anything as low as just over $500 per month. Currently, just about half of all American clothing is made in China. Dayang Trands plays relaxing music of the factory floor in an effort to make working conditions more pleasant. Technology companies like Apple - who rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing - have vowed to increase pressure for reforms, but concerns remain over human rights abuses in the Communist country. Ms Guilian is now a member of an elite group of 3,000 within the National People’s Congress.","There has been huge controversy over the outfits being produced abroad .

A drug addict robber who 'snuffed out the life' of a widow as she desperately clung on to a handbag containing her late husband's ashes has been found guilty of murder. Nellie Geraghty, 79, was discovered face down in the mud just 100 yards from her home in Shaw, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, after suffering a 'most violent attack' at the hands of Mark Royle on her way to her local luncheon club. She received serious head injuries with the 'overwhelming likelihood' that she was knocked to the ground by Royle, 37, and while lying on the floor was kicked or stamped on, a jury at Manchester Crown Court was told. Brutal: Drug addict Mark Royle, left, has been convicted of the murder of Nellie Geraghty, 79, right. She was found face down in the mud yards from her home in Shaw near Oldham, greater Manchester, after suffering a 'most violent' attack . The prosecutor said it was the defendant’s . intention to cause her serious harm as he violently wrenched the . bag from her grasp last November. The . court heard that Mrs Geraghty was an 'extremely active and independent . lady' who lived alone on a sheltered housing estate for the elderly. Her . husband, Frank, had died some years ago and she was so devoted to him . she had taken to carrying some of his ashes in her shoulder bag whenever . she went out. She also tended to carry cash of up to £200 in the bag at any given time. Mrs Geraghty was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital but failed to regain consciousness and died in the early hours of November 26. The cause of death was internal bleeding and a heart attack - likely to have been suffered at the crime scene. Sentencing him to life, Judge Andrew Gilbart said: 'She made a ready victim of a . bag snatch. She was just four feet 10 inches tall and 79 years old. Target: Mrs Geraghty clung on to her handbag, pictured, as Mark Royle desperately tried to hold onto it. The bag was later discovered in a river . Murder scene: The alleyway in Shaw, near Oldham, Greater Manchester where Nellie Geraghty, 79, was found unconscious around midday on Thursday 24th November. 'She was carrying her shoulder bag. I am sure you thought it contained . money or other things worth stealing. 'As you tried to get it she clung . to it, which is not surprising for she carried within it among other . things the ashes of her late husband whose memory sill burned vividly . for her.' Judge Andrew Gilbart QC, told Mark Royle he . had ""snuffed out her life just to get the price of your next fix or . two"". The handbag was dumped in a river but the ashes were not recovered. Detectives launched an investigation and officers trawled through CCTV footage of Shaw, said the prosecutor. Cameras . showed the defendant from 9.40am onwards riding a mountain bike in and . around the town with no particular purpose of direction. Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said: 'We say the reason he was doing so was he was up to no good. 'He was looking for an opportunity for crime to fund his drug habit.' Devoted: Nellie Geraghty, 79, with her late husband Frank in 1994. Nellie was found unconscious around midday on Thursday, November 24. Her handbag, which contained her husband's ashes was missing. She subsequently died . He said that immediately after the . attack on Mrs Geraghty the defendant was captured on camera cycling away . from the vicinity - a minute after the last known sighting of the . pensioner. Royle, of no fixed address, had denied the murder or manslaughter of Mrs Geraghty and also robbing her. He shook his head as the murder verdict was returned. Following . the verdicts, Ian Rushton, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the North . West area said: 'Mrs Geraghty was still clutching the handle of her bag . when she was found unconscious, evidence of how bravely she must have . struggled to prevent her bag, and her husband's ashes, from being . stolen. 'Mark Royle's . actions were completely the opposite, cowardly and despicable. He . deliberately targeted an elderly woman because she wouldn't be able to . defend herself and used appalling violence to snatch her bag from her. Lasting love: Nellie Geraghty, second right, with her husband Frank, right on their wedding day in 1969. 'He must have known that she was seriously injured, but his only concern after attacking her was to use the cash that he had robbed to buy drugs. In a statement Mrs Geraghty's family said they had been overwhelmed by the response of the local community in Shaw and the general public. It read: 'We have been left completely devastated by what this man has done to Nellie. It has left a very big empty space in all of our lives. 'The only comforting thought to us is that Nellie is now back together with her beloved Frank. 'Shaw does not deserve a monster such as Royle and we are so grateful that justice has been done. No amount of time served by him will ever bring our Nellie back.' Sentencing will follow shortly.","Judge tells killer Mark Royle you 'snuffed out her life just to get the price of your next fix or two’
