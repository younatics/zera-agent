"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela has been hospitalized again, but officials say it's only for a routine checkup. ""Doctors are conducting tests and have thus far indicated that there is no reason for any alarm,"" according to a statement from the presidential office Saturday. In January, Mandela completed his recovery from a lung infection and gallstone surgery and gradually returned to his normal routine, officials said at the time. Mandela, 94, who has not appeared in public since 2010, had continued receiving treatment at his home in Houghton, a suburb of Johannesburg. Mandela was hospitalized for a lung infection in early December and a week later underwent surgery to remove gallstones. He was discharged from the hospital after a two-week stay. During the time of apartheid in South Africa, Mandela was convicted of sabotage and was imprisoned for 27 years until 1990. He and former President F.W. de Klerk, who dismantled apartheid, shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. A year later, Mandela became the nation's first black president. In November, South Africa issued banknotes bearing Mandela's picture. Despite his rare public appearances in recent years, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. Mandela's impact has extended far beyond the borders of his own country. After he left office in 1999, he was involved in mediating conflicts from Africa to the Mideast. Mandela also was treated for an acute respiratory infection in January 2011. The next month he had surgery for an abdominal hernia.","No reason for alarm, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-one U.N. peacekeepers detained by Syrian rebels this week have been handed over to Jordanian authorities at the border with Syria, the Free Syrian Army told CNN Saturday. Jordanian officials confirmed the release and added their government had no coordination nor agreement in the handover, said spokesman Samih Maaytah. Official protocol was followed, he added. The 21 peacekeepers were turned over at the Syrian-Jordanian border at Yarmouk valley on Saturday, Free Syrian Army chief of staff General Salim Idris told CNN. Rebels had detained the peacekeepers, identified by the Philippine government as Filipino, in a Syrian village near the Golan Heights. Syrian opposition coalition President Moaz al-Khatib says the rebels took the peacekeepers for their own safety due to fighting there. The peacekeepers reportedly are unharmed. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ""welcomes"" the release of the peacekeepers, the organization said in a statement. The peacekeepers have an impartial role, the statement said, and the secretary-general called for both sides in the conflict to respect the freedom of movement and security of his personnel. Fighting in the area resumed in the villages near the Jordanian border following the handover, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported. The group reported 63 deaths across Syria on Saturday. International tension had grown this week after about 30 Syrian rebels detained the peacekeepers and refused to let them go. The United Nations and Filipino government demanded their release. The consul general of Philippine embassy in Jordan confirmed the release, and said the peacekeepers were being transported to Amman. The rebels initially said that the peacekeepers were trying to aid their enemy -- the regime of President Bashar al-Assad -- when they entered a Syrian village near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces. Al-Khatib then said the peacekeepers were taken to protect their safety and that of a U.N. convoy in an area under bombardment for seven days. CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","NEW: Ban Ki-moon ""welcomes"" the peacekeepers' release .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to review an abortion-related appeal, a sign the justices were not eager to jump into the contentious social issue. The case dealt with the constitutionality of state ""personhood"" laws that say life begins at conception, and would give human embryos the rights and privileges of citizens. Initiative Petition 395 is a proposed ballot measure to amend Oklahoma's state constitution, but was unanimously struck down by the state's supreme court. Those justices said the measure, if approved, would unconstitutionally ban access to abortions, and concluded that defining a fertilized human egg as a person ""is clearly unconstitutional."" The high court gave no reason why it decided not to review the Oklahoma case. Supporters of the measure believe voters should be given the right to decide an issue like defining life, and said it was unfair for the courts to block the law before it was enacted. Opponents counter it would essentially block abortions even in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life was in danger. They also said it would severely restrict use of contraception and in vitro fertilization. A bill similar to Oklahoma's is pending in the Virginia legislature. Voters in Colorado and Mississippi have rejected ""personhood"" ballot initiatives in recent years. Many backers had hoped to use such ""gateway"" measures to force another Supreme Court showdown over the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion. The case is Personhood Oklahoma v. Barber (12-145).","Case focused on ""personhood"" laws that say life begins at conception, extend certain rights to embryos .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-one U.N. peacekeepers detained by Syrian rebels this week could soon be released, representatives for the United Nations and a Syrian opposition group said Friday. ""All the parties"" have agreed to a release of the 21 held since Wednesday, and the U.N. peacekeeping agency has dispatched a team to help collect them, U.N. spokeswoman Josephine Guerrero said. But the effort was called off Friday due to darkness, and the team will try again on Saturday, Guerrero said. Rebels had detained the peacekeepers, identified by the Philippine government as Filipino, in a Syrian village near the Golan Heights. Syrian opposition coalition President Moaz al-Khatib said Thursday that the rebels took the peacekeepers for their own safety due to fighting there. The peacekeepers reportedly are unharmed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based Syrian opposition group, said Friday that the peacekeepers are expected to be released between 10 a.m. and noon Saturday in Syria, citing one of its rebel contacts. The release is contingent on a cease-fire between government forces and rebels around the village of Jamlah, where the peacekeepers are said to be held, the group said. Government forces shelled the area Friday, according to the Syrian National Coalition, the principal Syrian opposition group. The rebels will hold Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime responsible ""for any harm that would happen to the U.N. employees,"" a statement from the coalition said. Late Friday, a man who said he was one of the peacekeepers told the Arabic news network Al-Arabiya via Skype that he expects to be released Saturday. ""The reason for the delay is the shelling,"" he told Al-Arabiya. ""We were about to be released this evening, but the shelling resumed. All 21 peacekeepers are safe and treated well."" CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the interview. Earlier this week, a video posted on the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights' YouTube website showed six of the peacekeepers sitting in a room. CNN couldn't immediately verify the authenticity of the video. In it, one peacekeeper gives a statement to the camera: . ""We are here safe in this place. We are here because while we are passing through position (unintelligible) to Jamlah, there were bombing and artillery fires. This is why we stopped and, civilian people tell us, for our safety, and distributed us in different places to keep us safe. And they give us good accommodation and give us food to eat and water to drink."" The rebels have said the peacekeepers entered the village near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces. The rebels initially said they suspected the peacekeepers were trying to aid their enemy -- the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations said the peacekeepers were on a ""regular supply mission."" Two other videos that rebels posted on YouTube present the rebels' point of view. In one, a rebel insists that the peacekeepers will be held until al-Assad's forces withdraw from the village of al-Jamlah. The other video shows rebels walking near several U.N. trucks. ""This U.N. force entered Jamlah village to assist the regime ... and (the U.N. is) claiming that they are here just to stop the clashing,"" a rebel says. Members of the U.N. Security Council condemned the detention of the peacekeepers. The unrest in Syria began in March 2011, when al-Assad's government began a brutal crackdown on demonstrators calling for greater political freedoms. The protest movement eventually devolved into an armed conflict, one that has devastated cities and towns around the country and spurred more than 720,000 Syrians to flee to neighboring nations, according to the U.N. refugee agency. This story was reported by CNN's Richard Roth from the U.N. and Hamdi Alkhshali from Atlanta, and written by Jason Hanna in Atlanta.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- When Joseph Macia watched a video of his son's fatal dragging, a piece of his heart died with him. Shaky but clear, it showed his son talking animatedly with police officers. He was then handcuffed to the back of a police van, writhing and kicking as it drove away slowly. The crowd yelled as the vehicle accelerated, dragging his lower body on the road as it sped away . Opinion: Why brutality is ingrained in psyche of South Africa . Taxi driver Mido Macia died a few hours later of head injuries suffered during the incident in Daveyton, near Johannesburg . ""I was shocked when I heard what happened and saw the video,"" the anguished father said Friday. ""What the cops did was not justice, it was a crime. The cops need to be taught a lesson."" The video was captured by cell phone late last month, sparking outrage in a nation that has seen a series of police brutality incidents recently. Nine South African officers appeared in court in Benoni on Friday to face murder charges in the incident. Shock, questions . The video shocked the world for its brazen cruelty. In it, Macia is seen in a red T-shirt and white sneakers, handcuffed to the back of a police van, which then pulled away. Officers and bystanders ran alongside the vehicle. Macia, a Mozambican, died February 26 in police custody, hours after the incident, officials said. His body will be transported to the Mozambique capital of Maputo for a funeral Saturday. It is unclear what led to the altercation. 'Horrific and unacceptable' Outraged officials vowed justice will be served. ""South African police service are required to operate within the confines of the law in executing their duties,"" President Jacob Zuma said. ""The visuals of the incident are horrific, disturbing and unacceptable. No human being should be treated in that manner."" Tough action will be taken against those involved, the nation's acting police minister said, calling for a speedy independent investigation. It was unclear how many other officers are involved in the incident. The commander of the local police station was also suspended pending an investigation, the South African Police Service said. A harsh reminder . ""We are shocked by this incident,"" said Moses Dlamini, a spokesman for the Police Investigative Directorate, an independent government agency that looks into possible crimes by police. The incident was a harsh reminder of police brutality rampant in the nation. The directorate received 720 new cases for investigation of suspicious deaths in custody or in other policing contexts between April 2011 and March 2012, Amnesty said. ""This appalling incident involving excessive force is the latest in an increasingly disturbing pattern of brutal police conduct in South Africa,"" said Noel Kututwa, Amnesty International's southern Africa director. In defense of the police force . But authorities defended officers, saying they are not a reflection of the entire nation's force. ""There are many other officers who are dedicated, who uphold the law and arrest criminals all the time,"" Dlamini said. Under apartheid rule in South Africa, white police officers subjected the nation's black majority to inhumane treatment. But in this case, the man and police in the video, as well as those in the crowd, are black. Apartheid rule ended in the 1990s, and the government reformed the police departments and made them more diverse. A series of scandals . Despite the changes, the nation grapples with a high crime rate, including rapes, armed robberies and police brutality, analysts say. South Africa's history of violence ""is part and parcel of daily life,"" said Johan Burger, a senior researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria. Some police officers believe that they ""are above the law"" and that there won't be consequences for their actions, he said. South Africa's police force has been plagued by a series of scandals recently. In August, officers opened fire on striking platinum miners in Marikana, killing 34 in one of the most deadly police shootings since the end of apartheid. Last month, one of its officers -- Hilton Botha -- was booted from a high-profile murder case after prosecutors reinstated attempted murder charges against him. He is accused of chasing and firing on a minibus full of people while drunk in 2011. He is charged with seven counts of attempted murder. Botha was testifying in the trial of Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius, who is charged with killing his girlfriend on Valentine's Day. He later resigned from the force, citing personal reasons.

"(CNN) -- Half a century after the heyday of Camelot, a treasure trove of John F. Kennedy personal items now belongs to a bevy of JFK fanatics. At the center of the cache: Kennedy's Air Force One bomber jacket, which sold at auction Sunday for $629,000. Bidding for the brown leather jacket, affixed with a patch of the presidential seal, far exceeded the pre-auction estimate of $20,000 to $40,000. The $629,000 total includes an 18% buyer's premium, or the amount paid to the auction house, according to John McInnis Auctioneers of Massachusetts. Kennedy's jacket is among hundreds of JFK memorabilia nearly forgotten about until the family of David Powers, Kennedy's special assistant and close friend, discovered the locked stockpile while preparing to sell the family's home. The items auctioned included a collection of Kennedy family photographs from the late 1930s, working copies of a foreign policy speech and signed letters from the president to his parents. The stash also includes a May 29, 1963, birthday card for Kennedy signed by his toddler son, John Jr., as well as a marked-up itinerary for his final presidential trip, a visit to Dallas in November 1963. Powers was with Kennedy the day the president was assassinated in 1963. He became the first curator of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and died in 1998. November 22 marks the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas.","The family of JFK's assistant and close friend auction a cache of personal items .

"(CNN) -- It's now a week after New Years Day. Can we please stop saying, ""Happy New Year?"" Telling people ""Happy New Year"" more than a week after the first of the year is like keeping your Christmas lights up until February. It's tacky. And I grew up in New Jersey; I know a thing or two about tacky. Plus it's bad New Year's etiquette. That's not just me talking, that's the opinion of etiquette expert Crystal Seamon-Primas, founder of the South Jersey School of Etiquette. (Stop laughing. We are not all ""Jersey Shore."") Seamon-Primas told me: ""In my opinion, after the first week, I stop wishing others a Happy New Year, the new year is well on its way."" The biggest reason we need to stop New Year's wishes weeks into the year is that it sounds so insincere. Hollow, not heartfelt, like something you say to a co-worker you really don't know well to fill an awkward silence, a small step up from, ""That's some weather we're having, huh?"" The same goes for the insincerity you detect when people greet you a few days after January 1 with the question: ""So how's your new year been so far?"" Really? You are actually asking if I have survived the first ""grueling"" 48 hours of the year? If you really care about how my year is going, ask me in October. Look: No one says ""Happy Thanksgiving"" on December 1. I never heard anyone offer a ""Happy Fourth of July"" on July 6. And when is the last time you heard a ""Happy St. Patrick's Day"" on March 19? Even with the big religious holidays, well wishing starts before the holiday and stops with its occurrence. Go ahead and joyfully exchange wishes of ""Have a Merry Christmas"" the week before the holiday through Christmas Day, but not on December 29. Happy Hanukah greetings are fine throughout the eight-day holiday but not after. And Ramadan wishes are contained within the 30 days of the holy month and stop with the Eid celebration at the month's end. Tech: Losing New Year's resolve? Google wants to help . Sure, I get it: It's a wish for a full year, not just a day. But among the vast array of omens that predict good fortune for the coming year, not one involves saying Happy New Year's for weeks on end. Believe me, there are some odd superstitions out there that will supposedly bring you luck for the year, from kissing a loved one as the clock strikes midnight to writing your new year's wishes on a piece of paper and planting it in the ground to eating lentils or black-eyed peas on New Year's Day. There are even admonitions to avoid certain activities on New Year's Day because they portend bad luck for the coming year. One such superstition tells us that eating poultry on New Year's Day means you will financially struggle for the coming year, which I really wish I had known before I ate chicken with mixed vegetables on January 1. If even one custom instructed us that extended New Year's wishes would increase the chances the year would indeed be a good one, I'd be saying Happy New Year's every day until April. But none do. Consequently, I propose that from here out we need to come together in a bipartisan fashion -- as a lesson to our dysfunctional Congress -- and stop with New Year's wishes after the first seven days of the year. If someone does offer you such a greeting two or three weeks into the New Year, don't be rude, simply explain that it's like wishing someone Happy Valentines Day on February 18 . In time, hopefully we'll all be on the same page on this issue. However, even if you are reading this after January 7, I still sincerely wish you, and your family, a very happy and healthy New Year. But this is the very last time I will say that in 2013. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: You can stop saying Happy New Year now. It's tacky and too late .
Even South Jersey School of Etiquette president said after the first week, stop .
He says we don't say Merry Christmas or Happy Hanukah when those holidays are over .
Obeidallah: It gets progressively more insincere. Lets agree to cut off the greeting at 7 days ."
"(EW.com) -- Close your eyes and begin listing all of the various characters, dialogue, imagery, creatures, props, sets, and songs you can from ""The Wizard of Oz."" Chances are, it'll take you about as long to finish as it took Dorothy and her companions to traipse their way to the Emerald City.

Grab a box of Munchkins from Dunkin Donuts, visit the ruby slippers in the Smithsonian, or watch any one of these movies.) So how do you go about making a movie that tells the story of what happened before Dorothy's house flew over the rainbow and landed lickety-splat on the Wicked Witch of the East? Basically, how do you make a prequel to everyone's childhood? ""Very carefully,"" says Sam Raimi. The director of the ""Spider-Man"" and ""Evil Dead"" trilogies was at first extremely hesitant to take on ""Oz the Great and Powerful""—the huge and expensive family film out March 8 that Disney hopes will hit the same sweet spot as 2010′s ""Alice in Wonderland""—for a very simple reason: ""The original is my favorite film of all time,"" he says. "" I didn't want it sullied. I didn't want to be involved in a production that might trade off the goodwill of that film, so I didn't even want to read the script at first. Luckily I did.

"(CNN) -- There's a moment, when singer LP performs the song ""Into the Wild,"" that her face tightens and she purses her lips, even as she keeps singing. It happened show after show at the South by Southwest music festival, whether on sunny daytime stages, in dark clubs, or while rocking a ukulele, solo, in the middle of an Austin, Texas, street. She is trying not to smile. She knows the line that will make people recognize the song, and its singer. Maybe they saw her belt it at Sayers Club in Los Angeles, or they're among the millions that watched it on YouTube, or they remember how it burst from a Citi commercial as a rock climber ascended a 400-foot sandstone tower: ""Somebody left the gate open, you know we got lost on the way."" Those big notes give her away: Not Laura Pergolizzi, songwriter, but LP, the singer crowds have heard, but never heard of. The artist, whose CD/DVD, ""Into the Wild,"" debuts Tuesday; who'll be on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" on Wednesday; and whose album with Green Day producer Rob Cavallo will come out later this year. Always after that line, she knows, the murmurs start. ""I see a few of them, every time, look at their friend and go, 'Ohhhh.' It's kind of funny and embarrassing at the same time,"" LP said during an interview at SXSW. ""And awesome."" The singing, the recognition -- they weren't part of any big plan. Pergolizzi's dad was a lawyer. Her mom sang opera, but gave it up when she had a family. Growing up in New York, they listened to oldies, not pop radio. But after her mom passed away in 1997, Pergolizzi finished high school, moved to Manhattan and found music was what made her happy. ""I didn't know anybody, I didn't have any connections,"" she said. ""The first time I wrote a song, I couldn't really believe -- 'Can you just do that? You're just allowed?' I never thought about songs on the radio, and who wrote them."" She was first signed as an artist on Island Def Jam, then RedOne. The deals never shook out, but she gained a reputation as a writer who could churn out dozens of tunes to suit any voice or sound. She wrote Rihanna's ""Cheers (Drink to That)"" and chunks of Heidi Montag's album, ""Superficial."" Christina Aguilera and Backstreet Boys cut her work. There are songs in the works with Joe Walsh, Rita Ora and Isa Summers from Florence and the Machine. Writing was so demanding that she left New York in 2010 and moved to Los Angeles. She'd show up to sessions with a ukulele -- a $60 instrument she'd taught herself to play using Beatles songs posted online -- and strung together melodies and lyrics that worked. Creating pop for other people made her understand what songs need, she said, but as an artist turned writer, she was compassionate. She understood what it was like to sit in a room with people trying to decide your voice and put words in your mouth. ""I was having a nice anonymous little time as a writer,"" she said. ""I really was on the writer path. I was sort of minding my own business. I loved making a living in music."" Sometimes, for fun, she'd show up at Bardot, Soho House or Sayers Club in Los Angeles for one- or two-song cover sets -- ""Barracuda"" by Heart, ""The Funeral"" by Band of Horses, ""Uninvited"" by Alanis Morissette or ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night,"" the Lead Belly version Nirvana remade. The crowds at music industry hangouts always liked her; she was one of them. One night, when it seemed right, she pulled out her ukulele and played ""Into the Wild"" on stage. The audience exploded. She remembers people chanting her name, once adopted just for convenience, later because it felt right: Not Laura -- LP. ""When I'm behind a big song, I feel like I can do big things,"" she said. That moment was a big one. She signed to Warner Bros. Records (which is owned by CNN's parent company, Time Warner), found managers she trusted, and began to think more about what her sound should be -- not what others wanted, or what other singers needed, but what hit all the highs and lows in her vocal range and personality. ""The thrill of writing songs for other people, when you get that right, that person's soul speaks to that song, you've done them a favor and the world a favor,"" she said. ""That's what writing is all about -- you're always trying to get the real picture. ""I wrote a bunch of songs I feel only I can sing."" It's not an anonymous life now. For long days at SXSW, Pergolizzi had managers, PR people, photographers and a band around her. The singer had a signature look -- a pillow of tight black curls around her face, broken-in black boots, simple silver jewelry. She also had about seven black jackets that all looked more or less the same. She looked on the outside like she feels on the inside, LP said, and finally has the instruments and stage to express it. Crowds piled in to see her in Austin, or stopped to listen when they heard the line, one they all recognized. They'd always look up to see the person it was coming from. Maybe it all looks like a character, LP said -- the new city, the name change, the uniform, the ukulele. But she knows now which songs are hers. ""I think everybody needs to find out who they are and who their, like, inner superhero is, or who you like to be,"" she said. ""The world would be a better place if everyone was doing what the hell they wanted to do and being who they wanted to be. ""I hope they do.""","Singer LP's CD/DVD, ""Into the Wild,"" comes out Tuesday .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A long way from the big-spending, flag-waving spectacle of competing U.S. presidential campaigns, a momentous leadership change is quietly unfolding in the world's second largest economy. In November, thousands of specially chosen members of China's Communist Party will converge on Beijing for the 18th National Congress. There, they'll announce who'll fill the soon-to-be-vacant roles of president, vice president, premier and assorted chiefs of important government departments. Ahead of the congress, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout sat down with three prominent China watchers -- Victor Gao, Hung Huang and John Pomfret -- to discuss the leadership change and their views on the fate of the country and its ruling Communist Party. We preview some of the key issues in the discussion. On China: Full show times . Lu Stout: There seems to be factions at the top, or a lot of discussions about factions at the top, of the Communist Party. You have the Jiang Zemin faction, the Hu Jintao faction. Is that overstated or is this the reality? Gao: Many people from outside China tend to look at the Communist Party of China as a monolithic group of people. But in reality, it is not. First of all, personalities do matter. Secondly, these so-called political camps do exist. You have these people in higher positions, which belong to different traditions. You have different mentors, you have different associations. So this is what we call intra-party democracy in China. Hung: I think its true there is diversity within the Party, but it is not the Party's intention to make it transparent to people who are not in the Party or to anyone who is not part of the very political elite. If there is conflict, the first reaction of the Party tends to be ""close the doors, shut it off, don't let the public see it."" So that's why its public image seems to be secretive, and a bit closed off and monolithic, but there is dissension within the party for sure. Pomfret: So much of this stuff is based on guess work, because of the lack of transparency about the internal functions of China. But you'll see it; these struggles manifest themselves in policy statements. And that's done actually relatively publicly. Do you live in China? Share your stories of daily life with CNN . Lu Stout: So your thoughts on presumptive leader Xi Jinping -- a so-called princeling, or son of a revolutionary leader. How was he able to rise to the top? And how will he fare as China's next president? Gao: He had a very unique career path (with) experience in four provinces and cities -- Hebei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shanghai -- in addition to his very unique and extraordinary experience at the Central Military Commission. In addition to that, when he was in a civilian position, Xi kept his associations with the Chinese military through various ways: serving in the reserve forces, taking up leadership of the provincial garrison, for example. So that sets him apart from almost all the current civilian leaders in China. Hung: I think him having the pedigree is actually a plus; that gives him a lot more leeway in terms of bringing about changes. But nobody knows whether he sees it that way or whether he will take the step, and whether politics will allow him to do it. I mean, there are just too many things in the balance. But what he's stepping into is a historical period, which actually make changes possible. Pomfret: Clearly he has a strong personality, much stronger than the previous leadership. How he uses that personality to his benefit or to China's benefit, I think it's an open question. Read more: China's next leaders -- Who's who . Lu Stout: What do Chinese -- especially young Chinese -- want? Is it freedom, democracy, political reform, or apartment, car and economic stability? Hung: I think they want both.... They do expect change for the better, more liberal, better reforms in the political system. But they are not basically saying we have to have certain elements that are modeled after a particular Western government. Lu Stout: So there is this expectation for change... What does that mean for the Communist Party of China? Will it stay in power? What is its fate? Gao: I think that the Communist Party of China will remain the ruling party for many years, if not for many decades, to come. However, that doesn't mean that there will be no increasing amount of democracy or democratic participation. I think participation in the government, monitoring of the government, supervision of the Communist Party by other democratic parties and by the population in general will increase. It may not be the same as in the United States or in Britain or in European countries etc., it will be very much of Chinese characteristic, and that will set China apart from other developed countries for decades to come. Hung: I think the Chinese Communist Party will also continue to be the ruling party, but I think it needs to hear the people, and hear what they are saying, what they need and meet some of their demands, in order to do that. Pomfret: I generally agree, but I also think that from 1949 when China had its revolution until today, the Communist Party has actually been the main source of instability in China, and that when the party changes direction it causes enormous suffering in this country. So if we see significant fractures in that top echelon (of the Party), I think all bets are off. If they do not remain united, they're going to sink together. If they are united in terms of pushing China forward and listening to the increasing demands of their people, or some type of political opening, they will be in charge for decades to come.","""On China"" panelists discuss China's upcoming leadership transition .

"(CNN) -- Days of heavy rain have led to flooding in southwestern England and parts of Wales and at least one fatality, British authorities said Sunday. The UK Environment Agency posted a severe flood alert for the town of Helston, in the southwestern county of Cornwall, where the River Cober was rising over its banks, and warned towns across England and Wales to prepare for more high water. In Exeter, in neighboring Devon, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her Saturday night, the Devon and Cornwall Police Service reported. The Environment Agency said more than 800 properties have flooded since Wednesday. And the Met Office, the UK's national weather service, said more rain is forecast for the area -- but the wettest weather will be in the north. ""We can expect between 30 and 40 millimeters (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches) of rain falling in many areas and up to 70 millimeters (2 3/4 inches) of rain in parts of northeast England, continuing the risk of further flooding and travel disruption,"" forecaster Eddy Carroll said in a news release. On Twitter, Prime Minister David Cameron called the scenes of flooding ""shocking"" and said his government would make sure ""everything is being done to help."" The region has seen four days of non-stop rainfall that has capped months of heavy precipitation, including the wettest April-June period on record. More than 225 areas stretching from Cornwall through the Midlands region to the northeastern coast were under flood warnings Sunday afternoon as the latest system moved through, the Environment Agency said. Officials warned residents to use the daylight to prepare for more flooding Sunday and into the early hours of Monday. CNN's Susannah Palk and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: More rain, flooding forecast for Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona ended Real Madrid's 15-match winning run to snatch back top spot in Spain's La Liga with a 3-1 ""El Clasico"" victory in the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday. Jose Mourinho's team had been seeking to break the Real record set in 1960-61 and go six points clear, but surrendered the lead on goal difference despite scoring after 23 seconds. However, Barcelona have played one more match and Madrid will catch that up next weekend. The 163rd Clasico clash had been billed as a showdown between superstars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but neither FIFA Ballon D'Or award candidate could add to their league-leading tally of 17 goals on a rainy night in Madrid. Instead it was Karim Benzema who gave Real the perfect start when he pounced to volley home from close range after Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes gave the ball away, and Mesut Ozil's shot deflected into the France forward's path. Pinto's Clasico prediction: Tell him what you thought of the match . That boosted Mourinho's hopes of a first league win over the European champions, but Alexis Sanchez -- starting ahead of David Villa -- equalized on the half-hour with a fierce low shot after Messi burst through the middle. Josep Guardiola's team took the lead eight minutes after halftime when a shot by midfielder Xavi, making his 600th senior appearance for Barca, took a cruel deflection off Real defender Marcelo and wrongfooted goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Mourinho responded by replacing Ozil with Kaka, and Real should have leveled in the 65th minute when an unmarked Ronaldo headed wide from Xabi Alonso's perfect cross. The home side immediately paid for that, as Cesc Fabregas fired in a superb far-post header from Dani Alves' teasing right-wing cross. Rivalries renewed: Clasico preview in pictures . It was the former Arsenal midfielder's 10th goal in 13 starts this season, and gave Barca an advantage that Real could not reduce despite Kaka going close. Barca had won just 16 of the 81 previous Clasicos played in the Spanish capital, but have not lost there in the league since 2008. Third-placed Valencia failed to make ground on the leaders after conceding two late goals in a 2-1 defeat by Real Betis. Ruben Castro netted twice in time added on after teammate Jose Dorado put through his own net in the 66th minute. The defeat left Valencia seven points off the pace, while Betis moved away from the relegation zone and up to 13th. Fourth-placed Levante closed to within a point of local rivals Valencia with a 1-0 win at home to Sevilla. Defender Nano Rivas put his side five points clear of fifth-placed Sevilla with a 57th-minute winner after Sergio Ballesteros' effort was blocked on the line.","Barcelona claim top spot in Spain with 3-1 win away to Real Madrid .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The story of a king overcoming a speech impediment to lead his people through World War II took top honors at the 83rd Annual Academy Awards. ""The King's Speech"" won the best picture, best actor, best director and best original screenplay Oscars at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre Sunday night. The saga of how a college student created Facebook, which is now credited with helping citizens overthrow their leader in the Mideast, lost out on the big awards, but ""The Social Network"" did win Oscars for best musical score, film editing and best adapted screenplay. Natalie Portman, who played a ballet dancer in ""Black Swan,"" was given the best actress Academy Award. Portman also won Golden Globe and SAG best actress trophies in recent weeks. Portman, who is pregnant, was asked backstage if she might now consider ""Oscar"" as a name for her child. ""I think that's probably definitely out of the question,"" she said. When ""King's Speech"" director Tom Hooper accepted the best director Oscar, he noted that it was his mother who found the script for him. ""The moral of this story is listen to your mother,"" Hooper said. ""King's Speech"" writer David Seidler pointed out that at 73, he was the oldest person to ever win best original screenplay. ""My father always said to me I would be a late bloomer,"" Seidler said, ""I hope that record is broken quickly and often."" Colin Firth, who portrayed the stuttering King George VI in ""The King's Speech,"" completed his sweep of best actor honors with the Oscar win.""I have a feeling my career has just peaked,"" said Firth, who also won a Golden Globe and the SAG award. Firth was asked backstage what he would now do since the hectic film award season has ended. ""I think I'm going to cook a lot,"" Firth said. Cooking is ""a very good way to decompress,"" he said . He does not support the decision to re-release the movie with the F-word edited out to allow a younger PG-13 rating at U.S. theaters. King George VI was taught by his speech therapist to use the obscenity as a tool to smooth out his stuttering . ""The context of this film, it could not be more edifying, more appropriate,"" he said. ""It's not vicious."" Christian Bale repeated his Golden Globe and SAG award wins by taking the best supporting actor Oscar for his role in ""The Fighter."" Melissa Leo, who played the mother and manager of two boxers in ""The Fighter,"" completed her trifecta of major awards when 94-year-old Kirk Douglas handed her the best supporting actress Oscar. Leo also won Golden Globe and SAG best actress trophies. Douglas, who walked with a cane and spoke slowly with slurred speech, managed to upstage Leo with his humor, jokingly delaying reading what was in the envelope. His stand-up routine was rewarded with big laughs. Leo, whose acceptance speech included a censored expletive, used Douglas's cane to walk off stage. ""Inception,"" a film that explores the human mind and dreams, won four Academy Awards, including for cinematography, sound mixing, sound editing and visual effects. The film was also a best picture contender, although most of its eight nominations are in the technical categories. Two awards went to ""Toy Story 3"" for animated feature film and best original song. ""The Lost Thing"" won for short animated film. ""True Grit,"" based on the same book as the 1969 John Wayne film, failed to win in any of the 10 categories for which it was nominated. ""Alice in Wonderland,"" which was not among the 10 best picture nominees, was rewarded Sunday night with two Oscars, for costume design and art direction. ""Inside Job,"" a film about the 2008 financial system meltdown, won the best feature documentary Oscar. Producer Charles Ferguson used his acceptance speech to say that ""not a single financial executive has gone to jail and that's wrong."" The short documentary Oscar went to ""Strangers No More,"" a film about an Israeli school that includes students from 48 countries. The romantic comedy ""God of Love"" won the live action short film Oscar. A Danish movie, ""In a Better World,"" won the best foreign language film Academy Award.

"(CNN) -- An estimated 40,000 people in the United States are involved in professional dogfighting, an illegal blood sport with fight purses as high as $100,000. The latest accusations against Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick and three other people highlight the problem. They are accused in an indictment that describes dogs being routinely executed if they didn't fight fiercely. The indictment was handed down Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Richmond, Virginia. The nightmare of dogfighting is growing, according to the Humane Society of the United States. John Goodwin, an expert on animal fighting with the Humane Society, says there are an estimated 40,000 professional dogfighters in the United States, involved in putting on fights and buying and selling fighting dogs.   Watch what goes on at a high-stakes dog fight » . But, Goodwin adds, there could be as many as 100,000 additional people involved in ""streetfighting"" -- informal dogfighting, often involving young people in gangs. ""It's far more pervasive than people think and it's definitely been on the upswing in the past five to 10 years,"" he told CNN.  See how dogfighters operate and have their own language » . Statistics from animal shelters give another indicator of the rise in dogfighting, Goodwin said.  Fifteen years ago, 2 to 3 percent of the dogs coming into animal shelters were pit bulls; now, he said, pit bulls make up about a third. At one shelter in Jersey City, New Jersey, Goodwin said, the figure is 65 percent, with 20 percent of them showing the scars that indicate they have been fighting dogs. A database run by animal advocacy group Pet-abuse.com, which collects reports of animal abuse, shows reports of dogfighting cases increased from 16 in 2000 to 127 in 2006. The group has found 74 cases reported so far this year. Dogfighting is illegal in all 50 states. It's a misdemeanor in Idaho and Wyoming, and a felony everywhere else. But in some states where dogfighting is a felony, it's still perfectly legal to own a fighting dog or be a spectator at a dogfight.  See where it's legal to be a spectator » . A bill signed by President Bush in May made the federal law against dogfighting tougher, by strengthening penalties to felony level. The law bans interstate commerce, import and export related to animal fighting activities. Violators can now be sentenced to three years in jail and a $250,000 fine. Previously the maximum sentence was a year in jail. Despite the laws, dogfighting is big business.  Goodwin said it's impossible to estimate the amount of money involved, but the purse for a top-level professional fight could be $100,000. ""There are about a dozen underground dogfighting magazines, and about half a dozen ... registries that are exclusively used by either dogfighters or people that are fighting dog enthusiasts,"" Goodwin said.

"(CNN) -- Large swaths of southern New South Wales in Australia were threatened Wednesday by raging flames, the severity of which has surprised even veteran firefighters. ""It's about the worst I've ever experienced in just-on 60 years of firefighting,"" said Capt. Jim Simpson with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. Outside the town of Yass, flames swept rapidly across more than 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of farmland and up to the fence around Catherine Frith's house, where its march was halted. ""The firefighters were amazing,"" she said. ""There must have been about 60 trucks come in."" Her sheep did not fare as well. ""We know about 500 sheep have died -- or are being shot at the moment,"" she said. Thanks to firefighters like Simpson, the town of Tarcutta in southwestern New South Wales escaped by a whisker the fate suffered by Frith's sheep. A blackened line stops just outside the town of 200 residents. ""The wind change is probably what saved us as well as some pretty hard work from a lot of crews,"" said one firefighter. Despite such victories, New South Wales's premier, Barry O'Farrell, told reporters on Wednesday that danger remains. ""There are in the order of 130, 140 fires across the state and 30 uncontained,"" he said. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service said more than 1,200 firefighters with more than 360 trucks and more than 80 aircraft were working to stop the flames. There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries related to the fires, which have blackened 350,000 hectares (more than 1,350 square miles) of the state. One firefighter received slight injuries to his hands and face, firefighter Matt Inwood told CNN Wednesday. ""The next step in all this is for us to take stock of the devastation and destruction,"" Inwood said. Photos: Catastrophic fires threaten Australia . The weather has been brutal across Australia in recent days. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology said a recent heat wave had set temperature records. The average maximum daily temperature of 40.33 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded on Monday was the highest since December 1972. And during the last four months of 2012, average maximum daily temperatures were the highest on record since records began in 1910, the bureau said. Temperatures reached a peak of 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in Sydney on Tuesday. The intense heat, combined with strong winds, raised fears that even the smallest spark could be fanned into a blaze. Lower temperatures on Wednesday prompted authorities to rescind a ""catastrophic warning,"" but the risk was still deemed ""severe"" in the northeast section of New South Wales. Higher temperatures are forecast for the weekend. Read more: Scores cope with heartbreak after bushfires rip through Tasmania . Watch: Hot weather fuels Australian fires . The extreme heat combined with the late onset of the Australian monsoon have turned large areas of bush and scrub land across the state into a tinderbox. In the first days of the year, the heat contributed to the spread of fires across Tasmania, where police have charged a 31-year-old man with causing one of the worst of the fires by not extinguishing a campfire before leaving the site. Fires erupted this week in Victoria as well. Watch: Residents, vacationers flee fire zone . Prime Minister Julia Gillard went on television to warn of the dangers and urged people to watch news reports and judge whether they should get out of the path of any flames.

She said assistance would be available to help residents recover in 37 areas of New South Wales. The fires were reminiscent of what happened on February 7, 2009, also known as ""Black Saturday.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""The Help,"" a movie about the treatment of maids in a Mississippi town during the civil rights era, took top honors at the Screen Actors Guild Awards Sunday night, making it the movie to watch as the Oscar awards approach next month. Viola Davis won the best actress trophy, while Octavia Spencer was given the best supporting actress honor. Both women portrayed maids. ""The Help"" also won the best cast ensemble SAG award. Cover story: Is 'The Help' heroic or stereotyping? ""The stain of racism and sexism is not just for people of color and women,"" Davis said. ""It's all of our burden, all of us."" Davis' best actress win seemed to throw the Oscar competition into a frenzy, since she beat Meryl Streep and Michelle Williams, actresses who won Golden Globes two weeks ago. Streep was nominated for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in ""Iron Lady,"" and MIchelle Williams, was nominated for playing movie legend Marilyn Monroe in ""My Week With Marilyn."" Jean Dujardin won the SAG best actor in a film award for his lead role in ""The Artist,"" a black-and-white, silent film. The win gives Dujardin an apparent edge against George Clooney and the three other nominees in next month's Oscar best actor competition. Spencer's supporting actress SAG award makes her a clear frontrunner for the supporting actress Oscar, considering she also won the Golden Globe. ""These women represent our mothers and grandmothers,"" Spencer said, referring to the maids portrayed in ""The Help."" ""By honoring me, you're honoring them."" Christopher Plummer, 82, also earned frontrunner status for in the Academy Award best supporting actor competition by winning the SAG honor Sunday night for his role in ""The Beginners."" ""I just cannot tell you how much fun I've had being a member of the world's second oldest profession,"" Plummer said as he accepted his SAG trophy. Hollywood's awards season neared mid-point Sunday night with the 18th annual Screen Actors Guild honors -- the only industry awards that solely recognize performers. The SAG actor trophies go to both television and film actors, and the winners are chosen by their acting peers. SAG President Ken Howard also used the event to announce the actor union's board approved a proposal to merge with AFTRA, another acting union, pending approval of their memberships. On the prime-time television side, HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" won for best ensemble cast in a drama series for a second straight year. It was also the second consecutive time for the show's star Steve Buscemi to win the SAG best actor in a TV drama award his role of Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson.

"(CNN) -- Moms everywhere like to ask their unmarried daughters dreaded questions like: Why are you still single? Are you married yet? Anyone catch your eye? Especially around Valentine's Day. Sure, we've seen Carrie Bradshaw agonize over the issue, watched Bridget Jones' awkwardness around it, heard Amelie's lamentations au Francais, and we've even heard from the lovable Mindy Kaling vis-a-vis her Indian-American perspective. But, we haven't heard the modern African woman's story. Being an unmarried African woman in her childbearing years is like being a manicurist with a hand tremor: very odd and rather tricky. She is expected to marry early and marry well. African mothers, then, are in a deep crisis. They immigrated to the United States with the hopes that their daughters would get a good education and fulfill the American Dream. But they never considered that, along with having all that modernity, their daughters would, like the rest of America's young, empowered women, be so ""late"" in marriage. Granted, African moms are not alone in their hopes. But still, some of them seem particularly affected. What shall they do? Well, first, they might accept that their daughters have not just a ""double consciousness,"" as W. E. B. Dubois termed it, but rather infinite consciousnesses, complicating their very blackness. If an upper middle-class girl has one or more African parents, for example, she has likely schooled in the United States or Europe -- maybe even a generation after her own parents have. And she has likely spent a fair amount of time in London via Lagos, a common lifestyle practice for those of formerly colonized African countries. If she has lived down South, say in Texas, for some time, she has likely acquired a George Bush twang for survival sake. If she has taken up a neuroscience residency in Boston (which, of course, she must, if she is African), she might now sound like Matt Damon's sister. And the minute she wins an accolade in some not-so-diverse department (which, of course, she must, being African), she'll be labeled the ""first African-American"" to have done so. In short, she is global. If she is living in a melting pot like New York, she is global on steroids. Naturally, global girls outgrow such local traditions as arranged marriages, dowry and bride price, which have not been exclusive to African tradition (see the English period drama, ""Downton Abbey"") but have certainly lingered longer in homes of African descent. African moms need to accept that globalism has allowed their daughters to know the world better, and as a result, seek partnerships more wisely. This process of self-determination takes a tad longer to form than setting up an arranged marriage. Thankfully, my mom, educated in America, a New Yorker and rather global, has not been as insistent on marriage with me. But it seems like only yesterday her older sister, my aunt, warned about the dangers of waiting too long, or being too educated, to be married. Really, if you've watched Maggie Smith's blunt character, Lady Violet Crawley, in ""Downton Abbey,"" you have watched my aunt. Despite being an accomplished woman who acquired a Ph.D. later in life, she praised my graceful exit from my doctoral program. I'd just turned 21 when I'd chosen a rather eccentric doctoral study. In her words: ""What man would marry a 20-something-year-old Ph.D.-holder?"" It would be too intimidating to men. ""I'd do better to tone it down a bit,"" she suggested. Which brings me to my second plea to African moms. If you want your daughter to be as happy or happier than you have been in marriage, it makes no sense that she should dumb down the colorfulness of her character, the boldness of her spirit and the fire that made her the ""first African-American"" this or that in order to appease those who are potentially intimidated by her. If you'd never match a conservative Christian with a flagrant porn star, it's not clear why today's educated woman should edit herself in hopes of attracting a feeble idiot. Yes, she'd be married, but then she'd live only to repress herself for someone else's ego -- and what kind of message would that be for the children? You see, dear African moms, global girls need global boys. Not intimidated ones. We can sit and try to make sense of why one kind of match would work or not work for a global girl, but we must concede that love is messy and unpredictable. Love is not like your daughter's medical career with a blueprint to follow, or like a GPS map that can calculate the distance between Addis and Accra. Yesterday's woman wanted marriage. Today's woman wants love -- and marriage, if it turns out that way. Olivia Pope's character in the TV series ""Scandal"" spoke quite unapologetically for today's woman when she said: ""I could probably give all this up, and live in a country house and have babies and be normal. I could. But I don't want to. I'm not built for it. I don't want normal and easy...and simple. I want...painful, difficult...devastating...life-changing...extraordinary love."" Extraordinary love? Sometimes, dear African moms, that process is just a little more complicated than marrying your cousin like in the 18th century. So, you'll just have to be patient. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of China Okasi.","China Okasi: Moms everywhere like to ask their daughters why they're not married .

"(CNN) -- Sunday night's Oscar telecast was enough to make you drop your knitting and stare in amazement at the contortions being performed on stage at the none-dare-call-it-Kodak Theater -- and not necessarily by Cirque du Soleil, whose performance was one of the evening's weirder moments. Was it really just a year and a day ago that the Academy Awards made its big play for youth, via the double-edged disaster of James Franco and Anne Hathaway? OK, that didn't work. At all. But last night's full-frontal embrace of the past -- punctuated in no small way by the choice of a silent movie as Best Picture -- was a back flip, a half-twist, and a landing in deep denial. It wasn't the Academy's fault that the show's director-elect Brett Ratner self-destructed, or that Ratner's hand-picked host Eddie Murphy bailed, or that the plucky Billy Crystal had to be called in to host a show he hadn't done since 2004. It isn't Crystal's fault that he's 63 years old. But someone -- producer Brian Grazer, perhaps -- should answer for why a show celebrating an industry in so much trouble chose to cast itself as something so profoundly passÃ©. At a time when audiences are becoming increasingly disenchanted with the very ""theatrical experience"" the Academy spends so much time championing, why would the show's writers and producers characterize the idea of going to the movies as something quaint, nostalgic and on the way out? Time and again, participants reflected on moviegoing as something they remembered fondly from their childhoods. They might have been talking about the Civil War. It was a strange tone to take, especially since anyone who pays any attention at all to the media -- or lives in Hollywood, or talks to other people -- knew that ""The Artist"" was poised to win Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (which it did). When you have an 800-pound metaphor pending delivery, why add insult to injury? 84th Academy Awards: The winners list . It didn't help, of course, that the show was being held in the erstwhile Kodak Theater, which had a name change since the venerable company filed for bankruptcy. Crystal never mentioned the word ""Kodak,"" probably believing that it might make people in the film industry nervous that the company synonymous with film would be going out of business. But it wasn't the issue of changing technology that gave last night's show a stale air. It was the issue of unchanging taste. Crystal, game as usual, opened the show with the same shtick he's used all of the nine times he's hosted, including the comedy montage of mock scenes from nominated movies. It's never had any edge and isn't intended to, but the general tone of the comedy was bloodless, and even blinkered: Delivering one gag about the advanced age of Best Supporting Actor nominees Max von Sydow and Christopher Plummer, the host suggested that next year's show would be sponsored by Flomax (the prostate drug). This might have been funny, if 1) the disconnect between the Oscars and anyone under 30 wasn't so pronounced; 2) Plummer and von Sydow weren't among the classiest guys in the room; and 3) they weren't that much older than a lot of other people present. Plummer, showing that age is what you make of it, delivered the evening's most eloquent acceptance speech. But as deserving as he was (for ""Beginners""), he couldn't help but point up the industry's affection for the past, especially its own. Share your view on the Oscars . No one can deny Best Actress Meryl Streep is almost routinely spectacular, or that she gave a marvelous performance last year, albeit in a mediocre movie (""Iron Lady""). But there were several supposed sure things going into last night's awards. And the only one that didn't come true was Viola Davis' selection as Best Actress for ""The Help."" Granted, Streep's last win was 13 nominations ago (1983, ""Sophie's Choice""). But given that Octavia Spencer took home the Best Supporting Actress award for ""The Help,"" and got a standing ovation from the Oscar crowd besides, it makes you wonder. It could be that voters thought Davis' screen time was insufficient for the Best Actress prize, or that she wasn't the center of the story (Emma Stone was, arguably). But that's probably giving the Academy more credit than it deserves. The fact is, Spencer gave a much broader, comedic performance; Davis' work spoke to the real pain of racism. Similarly, the choice for Best Documentary -- ""Undefeated,"" the weakest among a pretty feeble list of nominees -- was about a white football coach and his black high school team, the kind of ""Blind Side"" vehicle that Academy voters gravitate to. Why? Because it makes them feel good without straining. For a town synonymous with left-leaning politics, Hollywood has never looked so starched and conservative. The idea would probably make Rick Santorum recoil in horror, but Hollywood's embrace of the past is rooted in the same thing as Republican primary voters' embrace of reactionary candidates: A profoundly uncertain future. I like ""The Artist"" as much as anyone (OK, probably a little less), but for all its charms, it's not a forward-looking film. And last night's Oscars was not a forward-looking show. It was rooted in a kind of paralysis, the kind that accompanies a deep-seated fear.

"(CNN) -- The Republican presidential candidates are preening and prancing throughout the Sunshine State in the hopes of winning the state's 50 precious delegates. Out in Hollywood, another kind of campaign -- one with prettier people, with better hair, but equally sharp nails -- will rage over the next three weeks for Oscar. The comparison is apt in the vast sums of money spent, the lobbyists hired, and the number of backsides kissed in order for studios to ensure their films pick up Oscars at the end of the campaign season, capped by a red carpet of triumph and tears the evening of February 26. To that end, studios spend millions of dollars to make sure their projects take home those little gold men. As in the presidential race, we've seen primaries leading up to the main event. Candidates were given tacit endorsements at the Golden Globes and again at Sunday evening's Screen Actors Guild Awards. After ""The Help"" took home a surprise win at the SAG Awards, the race for Best Picture has narrowed to that film and ""The Descendants"" and ""The Artist,"" both big winners at the Globes. For the next few weeks, until the close of Academy voting on the Sunday before the Oscars, the studios and distributors behind those three pictures -- Disney, 20th Century Fox and The Weinstein Company, respectively -- will be aggressively wooing the Academy's 6,000 members into their camps. As in a political campaign, you simply cannot win an Oscar without spending money. It doesn't matter who spends the most, but it does matter who spends it best. One of the better campaigns of the past five years was the 2010 win for the little war flick that could: ""The Hurt Locker."" Despite its critical acclaim and high-quality cinematography and script, it was the lowest-grossing best picture winner of all time, competing against the highest-grossing movie in recent history, ""Avatar."" Besides quality, of course, what did it have going for it? One hell of an Oscar campaign. Its studio, Summit Entertainment, was flush with vampire money from the ""Twilight"" series. Oscar watchers, including studio executives, film journalists and fellow Oscar campaigners, told me that Summit spent between $3 million and $5 million for the campaign, which consisted mainly of hiring consultants to spin ""Hurt Locker"" and ""Avatar"" in a battle of good versus evil within the press. ""Hurt Locker"" actually lost out to ""Avatar"" in the Globes race, and that might have been a well-timed boon for the small flick. It positioned it perfectly as the underdog going into the home stretch of the campaign. Besides the cachet of an Oscar win, the successful campaign typically pays for itself in dividends. In the nine months after ""The Hurt Locker's"" Oscar win, the film sold more than $31 million worth of DVDs in the United States, 214% of its U.S. box office gross of $14.7 million. That's what makes Oscar campaigning more than a $100 million-a-year cottage industry within the movie industry. Persuading members of the Academy to first nominate your film and then vote for it is tremendously similar to how political operatives get candidates elected. There is no single strategy for a successful Oscar campaign, but momentum is key. Peak too early and excitement peters out; peak too late and you've spent millions of dollars without enough time to get voters invested. Building momentum involves racking up accolades and awards from individual guilds and film festivals before the nomination voting in January. This year Weinstein is making sure ""The Artist"" gathers momentum at just the right time. It took home a Golden Globe and its lead actor, Jean Dujardin, brought home a Best Actor SAG. But it has yet to peak. How is momentum built? And why does it cost millions? After all, word of mouth is free. But an intricate web of gypsy publicists, rogue party planners, and entire full-service consultancies to generate that all-important buzz that drives a campaign can run more than $2 million. Sure, a DVD can be mailed for less than $2. But with elaborate packaging, express mailing and hand delivery, the cost can increase to $200 each. With 6,000 Academy members, that translates to more than $1 million to get the films in front of voters. One of the stealthier tactics of good campaigners is the third-party Oscar party, where someone who is not in the Academy hosts an event celebrating a film starring one of their good friends. The expenses for these can easily run to $2 million, which is often somehow subsidized by the studio. Like a good show-pony politician, the cast of a film needs to be tirelessly glad-handing voters and going to every event to fluff their film. If a movie's main players aren't willing to commit to living and breathing and fighting for their film for the two months leading up to the Oscars, they can forget about taking home a statue. Bills can run into the millions to fly the talent back and forth across the country and keep them upright and happy during the final stretch. Then there are screening costs and advertising costs. Full-page ads in trade magazines like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter can cost $25,000 each, with ad budgets ranging from $15,000 to $1 million. Political campaign tricks are obvious. Not so for Oscar campaigns. Selecting the leader of the free world may hold far greater stakes than what to put on your Netflix queue, but they both deserve a high level of transparency. Audiences deserve to know what goes into an Oscar win before they give it credence. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- A Florida jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife, a former two-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker who started when she was 16 and died in her 70s, attorneys said Thursday. A jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife. The jury of five women and one man deliberated for slightly more than a day before deciding on the amount, attorneys for both sides said. The jurors put the total award at $5.3 million but found that Philip Morris USA was only 36.5 percent responsible for the lung cancer that plaintiffs said killed Leon Barbanell's wife. Shirley Barbanell herself was deemed 63.5 percent responsible, the attorneys said. Plaintiff's attorney Jonathan Gdanski said the jury found a design defect and a breach of warranty. Philip Morris announced that it plans to appeal the case, one of thousands of ""Engle progeny"" cases, named after a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision that decertified a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry. That case involved Dr. Howard A. Engle, a Miami Beach pediatrician and smoker who served as the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit. The decertification decision let former class members file lawsuits individually, and thousands did. The Florida Supreme Court also allowed some factual findings about smoking causing disease be taken from Engle case and applied to the progeny cases ""so plaintiff's attorneys don't have to start from square one in each of these cases,"" said Ed Sweda, a lawyer for the Tobacco Products Liability Project in Boston, Massachusetts. The industry has balked at that. ""Today's verdict is the result of a severely prejudicial trial plan,"" said Murray Garnick, Altria Client Services senior vice president and associate general counsel, speaking on behalf of Philip Morris USA, in a written statement. ""From beginning to end, this case was marked by legal rulings that should be reversed on appeal, including allowing this jury to rely almost exclusively on findings by a prior jury that have no direct connection with the plaintiff in this case."" So far, six of the eight Engle cases that have gone to trial have come back with a plaintiff's verdict, said Sweda. ""Another bunch are in the pipeline ready for trial this year,"" he said. About Thursday's verdict, he said, ""This is certainly a clear indication that tobacco litigation is alive and well."" Gdanski said his firm has more than 150 Engle cases. ""We're more than happy to keep trying them,"" he said.","Leon Barbanell's wife smoked two packs a day for more than 50 years .

"(CNN) -- The National Hockey League and the NHL Players' Association struck a tentative agreement early Sunday that may end a three-month lockout of unionized players, league and union officials announced. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said the ""basic framework"" of a deal had been agreed upon after a 16-hour negotiating session at a Manhattan hotel. The details must be approved by both the players and the league's governing board, Bettman told reporters in a predawn news conference, and he said it was too early to provide details about what it might mean for a shortened hockey season. But players' union chief Donald Fehr said he expected those steps to follow ""fairly rapidly and with some dispatch."" Breaking down the new deal . ""Hopefully, within a very few days, the fans can get back to watching people who are skating and not the two of us,"" Fehr said. Sunday's deal could salvage the second half of the season and the Stanley Cup playoffs. The NHL scrapped its preseason and all games through the end of 2012 after its contract with the players expired on September 15, with no agreement between the two sides. There were 526 games, nearly 43% of the season, scheduled from the start of the regular season on October 11 through December 30, the NHL said. A similar labor dispute canceled the entire 2004-05 NHL season. Bettman has said any abbreviated regular season should probably have a minimum of 48 games per team. Some players had a ""crucial role in the final stages"" of reaching the agreement, the union said. ""Players in the room early Sunday for the announcement were: Craig Adams, Chris Campoli, Mathieu Darche, Shane Doan, Andrew Ference, Ron Hainsey, Jamal Mayers and George Parros,"" the players association said. Sports Illustrated has tracked the intricacies of the talks and flashpoint issues, and argued that the NHL is ""in dire need"" of a new way of handling labor relations. Initial reactions shared with CNN on social media were mixed. ""They waited too long. I think they're gonna take a well-deserved hit from hockey fans,"" HBobbie McLeod wrote on Facebook. But some fans expressed excitement. ""Now time to see the LAKings raise their banner! #Finally,"" wrote Lisa, a self-described former hockey fan, on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- Less than a week before The Academy Awards,  Scarlett Johansson had yet to make a starlet's most scrutinized fashion decision: Her Oscar dress. Her stylist, the renowned celebrity dresser Nicole Chavez, wasn't worried. Tight deadlines are as common as paparazzi in this industry. ""What it comes down to is -- may the best dress win,"" said Chavez, whose clients include Rachel Bilson, Kristen Bell and Katherine Heigl. ""I stay organized and maintain close relationships with designers and colleagues, so it's more fun than stressful."" Johansson, who was asked to present an Oscar two weeks ago, was measured for a gown four days before the event. Chavez, who researches styles from around the globe, asked: What silhouette? What color? What designer? ""My goal was to make her feel beautiful, happy and comfortable,"" she said. ""Find the perfect fit."" Award show culture demands uber-chic attendees, said Chavez. Resplendent, cutting-edge garbs are expected, or style-driven media like E!'s Fashion Police assault a celebrity's outfit with snarky quips. ""Just because she likes rainbow sherbet doesn't mean she has to dress like one,"" Joan Rivers said of actress Hailee Steinfeld's dress after the Screen Actors Guild awards in January. ""I mean, I don't dress like Metamucil and prunes."" Chavez strives to keep her clients off the ""Worst Dressed"" lists. Even with the pressure of the world watching, she said the ""getting ready"" process before the annual show is lighthearted. Johansson, who prefers the designs of Elie Saab, Dolce & Gabbana and Oscar de la Renta, will likely be surrounded by friends and family, sipping wine and taking pictures. Chavez, like a close girlfriend, will zip her flowing, complicated gown and arrange matching accessories. ""It's comparable to a wedding day,"" she said. ""Everyone will just be having a good time."" After the Oscars, the fate of an actress' attire is often similar to a bride's wedding dress: never to be worn again. Some custom-made styles worth ""tens of thousands of dollars"" are returned to designers the next morning, Chavez said. But 80% of the time, her clients get to keep the dress. ""After the designers make something so special for an actress, they 'gift' the dresses,"" she said. ""The dresses get so much press, so who could really wear them again?"" After a dress is gifted, some celebrities donate their famous threads to charity auctions. Clothes Off Our Backs in Universal City, California, raises money from celebrity goods to benefit Feeding America, a hunger-relief effort; Malaria No More, an organization determined to end malaria deaths in Africa by 2015; Hope North, a boarding school for escaped child soldiers and more. Chavez said there is endless action behind the scenes before and after award shows. ""I feel lucky to put together living, breathing art,"" she said. ""Dressing clients for the Oscars is an honor."" As for what Johansson will wear? ""Well, we can never say for sure until the actual show,"" Shavez said. ""So, we'll see on Sunday!"" For those watching the Academy Awards from home, the celebrity stylist shares five tips for everyday glamour: . 1. Invest in proper undergarments. ""No matter what size or shape you are, Spanx is your best friend."" 2. Find a great tailor. ""Very few things fit perfect off the rack and tailoring makes all the difference. It can make a $70 white button down from the Gap look like a $400 dollar fitted Prada shirt."" 3. Take a digital photo of yourself in the mirror before going out. ""You will be shocked to see what the naked eye doesn't! Black fabric is see-through when a camera flash hits it. No one wants their bra showing in family photos."" 4. Be prepared for mini fashion emergencies. ""I always carry a needle and thread kit, double-side tape and safety pins in my purse. You never know when you or a friend will be stranded."" 5. Be confident! ""When you love the way you look, it translates and people take notice. Fashion is an extension of your personality so have fun and stay true to yourself.""","Behind the scenes, stylists help celebrities prepare for award shows .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Justice Department prosecutors are moving closer to seeking indictments for a small number of Blackwater security guards in connection with the deadly shootings of 17 Iraqi civilians in 2007. A woman walks past a burned car in September 2007 after an incident involving Blackwater security guards. Sources close to the investigation say senior officials are weighing proposed grand jury indictments against as few as two to as many as six guards on criminal charges to be determined. The sources say final decisions would be presented to a federal grand jury at U.S. District Court in Washington. Iraqi authorities have accused Blackwater guards of killing 17 civilians and wounding nearly 30 in the shootings. But Blackwater has repeatedly said its guards were acting ""in response to a hostile threat,"" a statement repeated by company spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell in August. The deadly 2007 incident heightened tensions between U.S. and Iraqi government officials and contributed to a protracted, ongoing debate over the extent of immunity that U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors will have from Iraqi laws. Blackwater and other contractors are exempt from Iraqi law and it remains uncertain whether U.S. laws apply to their actions abroad. Although indictments may be approved by officials of the Bush administration Justice Department, any trial would be carried out in 2009 by prosecutors under President-elect Barack Obama's Justice Department, which may have a different view of the complex legal issues presented by the case. CNN Executive Producer Suzanne Simons contributed to this report.","Anywhere from two to six guards could be charged in connection with deaths of Iraqis .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michelle Williams carried home a Golden Globe Sunday night for her portrayal of movie legend Marilyn Monroe in ""My Week With Marilyn."" ""Thank you to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for putting in my hand the same award that Marilyn Monroe herself won over 50 years ago,"" Williams said as she accepted for best actress in a film comedy or musical. Since the Globes separates dramas from comedies -- unlike the Academy Awards -- Williams was not competing against Meryl Streep, whose portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in ""Iron Lady"" may be her toughest Oscar competitor. Streep's Globe category -- best actress in a drama film -- was set to be awarded toward the end of the 69th annual Golden Globes award show telecast. Woody Allen, who did not attend Sunday night's ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, won the Golden Globe for best film comedy or musical screenplay for ""Midnight In Paris."" While the Oscar nominations won't be announced until later this month, Allen's movie is considered a best-picture contender. The Golden Globe for best supporting actress in a film went to Octavia Spencer who played a maid in the Civil Rights era movie ""The Help."" Spencer quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in her acceptance: ""All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance."" Although the ""Help"" characters are fictional ""they represent scores of real people,"" she said. ""The narrative itself is part of our fabric,"" Spencer said backstage. ""It's important to keep the younger generation abreast of how far we've come, because this is really foreign to them."" The Globes are the unofficial launch of Hollywood's movie award season, which culminates six weeks later with the Academy Awards. Early in the broadcast, host Ricky Gervais took quick aim at the Hollywood Press Association, the group that hired him to perform hosting duties for a third year. Gervais, in his opening monologue, compared the Golden Globes to the Oscars, ""but without all that esteem."" The Globes are to the Oscars ""what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton. A bit louder, a bit drunker and more easily bought,"" he joked. The group of about 85 writers invited Gervais to host the telecast again this year despite -- or because of -- the controversy stirred last year by his take-no-prisoners jokes. Kelsey Grammer's Golden Globe may not be the biggest award given out Sunday night, but the actor may have been the happiest backstage where he revealed his wife is expecting twins. Grammer won for best actor in a television drama series for his role as a corrupt Chicago mayor in the Starz series ""Boss."" Among the first trophies handed out was the Golden Globe for best actress in a made-for-TV movie or mini-series to Kate Winslet for her role in HBO's ""Mildred Pierce."" It was Winslet's third Globe. She won two in 2009, for ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""The Reader."" Winslet was asked backstage her opinion of reports that Lindsay Lohan was in negotiations to portray the late Elizabeth Taylor in a film. ""I'm not going to go there, dude,"" Winslet said. ""It's kind of a hot zone."" Christopher Plummer won best supporting actor in a film for his role in ""Beginners,"" while Laura Dern won best actress in a television comedy or musical series for her work in HBO's ""Enlightened."" PBS's ""Downton Abbey,"" nominated for four Globes, won for best made-for-TV movie or mini-series. George Clooney's ""The Descendants"" and ""The Ides of March"" are among the six films nominated for best drama. Clooney is also a contender for best actor in a drama for his ""Descendants"" role and for best director and best screenplay for ""The Ides of March."" ""The Ides of March"" earned a best drama movie actor nomination for Ryan Gosling, who also is nominated for best actor in a comedy film for ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" The other best drama film nominees include ""The Help,"" which is nominated for five Globes, including a best drama actress nod for Viola Davis. Co-stars Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain are competing against each other for best supporting actress. Best drama contender ""Moneyball"" is also nominated for best screenplay, while Brad Pitt, who portrayed baseball general manager Billy Beane, is up for best actor in a drama film. Jonah Hill, who played Beane's statistical wizard, is nominated for best supporting actor. Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" is competing for best drama. Spielberg's ""The Adventures Of Tintin"" won the Golden Globe for best animated feature film. ""Hugo"" rounds out the nominations for the best movie drama category. Martin Scorsese won best film director for the 3-D family film. The best drama film actor category also includes Leonardo DiCaprio for his portrayal of former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover in ""J.

"(CNN) -- Most Oscar-bound celebrities spend the better part of that Sunday prepping themselves for the cameras -- and the fashion critics. They get their hair, makeup and nails done, shimmy into the proper shapewear, adorn themselves with millions of dollars worth of jewelry, slip on a pair of stilettos, and zip up their one-of-a-kind gowns. Yet, seconds after they step onto the red carpet, we've already decided whether or not their primping paid off. While it takes a mere moment to wind up on the worst-dressed list, it takes a stunning comeback, or two, before redemption is bestowed. And with everything that goes into achieving a ""best-dressed""-worthy look, attendees are lucky they have an entire season to perfect their red carpet style. ""Each awards show has a different personality style-wise, and people have learned to dress accordingly,"" said Sarah Bernard, host of ""The Thread"" on Yahoo!'s Shine. The Academy Awards calls for classic, formal attire, she said, but celebrities can have a little more fun with the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Grammy Awards, which allow for edgier ensembles. But even a classic look isn't a surefire way to keep the scrutiny at bay. See, not taking a fashion risk is a risk in itself, Bernard said, adding, ""It's important to mix it up."" Gallery: Golden Globe couture . That's exactly what ""Bridesmaids'"" actress Rose Byrne did when she showed up at the SAG Awards wearing an Elie Saab jumpsuit. ""It's so great to see anybody step out of the box and do something not so traditional,"" said stylist to the stars Nicole Chavez, whose clients include Rachel Bilson, Scarlett Johansson and Kristen Bell. ""(Celebrities) don't take as many risks on the carpet as they should. ... Because people are so quick to criticize, they're more careful about their selections."" But red carpet couture isn't about setting a trend. It's about wearing something flattering in a style you love, said the new mom, who hasn't outfitted anyone this awards season. One red-carpet regular who has stunned this season, wearing gowns that complement her shape, is ""The Help's"" Octavia Spencer, said Yahoo!'s Bernard. And with so many nominations for best actress in a supporting role -- she won the award at the Globes and the SAG Awards, among other shows -- Spencer is being watched closely. The actress has developed a relationship with Tadashi Shoji, the Japanese designer behind the lavender gown she wore to the Globes, and the silver number she donned for the SAG Awards. ""My mom always taught us to dance with the one that brung ya, and (Shoji) gave me a lot of clothes while we were on (""The Help"") publicity tour,"" Spencer told E! It's common for a celebrity to have a relationship with certain designers, Bernard said, referencing Charlize Theron, who wore a standout pale pink Dior gown to the Globes. (Theron is a spokesperson for Dior.) Bernard anticipates that Spencer will continue her ""classy and fashion forward"" streak at the Academy Awards on Sunday, possibly with another Shoji creation. Gallery: Couture at the Screen Actors Guild Awards . ""The red carpet is a very intense situation, and you want to be comfortable out there,"" Chavez said. ""If you're confident and comfortable, it reads. It you're uncomfortable, no matter how beautiful your dress is, it can end up not working."" The potential for discomfort is one reason footwear expert Meghan Cleary says shoes are the most important part of any red carpet look. ""(Shoes) have the biggest effect on how you feel,"" said Cleary, the author of ""Shoe Are You?"" ""They have an actual physiological effect on you -- the way you walk and carry yourself, and the way you stand."" Even for the Academy Awards, which calls for mostly floor-length gowns, ""shoes are still in the game,"" she said. Cleary expects most shoes on Oscar night to be delicate stiletto sandals, with jewels and metallic detail. ""A lot of times the shoe becomes part of the jewelry."" And with so much focus on the dress, shoes become a way for celebrities to experiment, and maybe take a fashion risk. Cleary says pairing a purple metallic stiletto with a red dress would create a fashion-forward and edgy formal look. ""I say go for it. Kudos to you,"" she said. ""But will you be excoriated on the red carpet for that? I don't know."" As a celebrity stylist, Chavez says she gravitates toward the rich colors during awards season, because the hues tend to show off detail better than pastels or black numbers. Plus, she said, publications are more likely to run photos of stars wearing bright-colored gowns -- like the scarlet Valentino that Michelle Williams wore to the SAG Awards. The saturated, rich jewel tones are all over the red carpet this season, like the jade green Oscar de la Renta dress Emily Blunt wore to the SAG Awards, or the fuchsia Marchesa gown Sofia Vergara donned the same night. On the flip side, nude-colored gowns have also been all the rage this awards season -- Jessica Biel, Kristen Wiig and Piper Perabo have all tried out the trend, somewhat unsuccessfully. (Each celebrity ended up on at least one media outlet's worst-dressed list, in addition to getting burned on E!'s ""Fashion Police."") A nude gown is ""so incredibly stunning in real life, yet, just doesn't translate on TV or in photos,"" Chavez said. Just because a gown looks good in person, she added, it doesn't mean it will translate for the cameras, which is why Chavez always photographs her clients in a gown before a final decision is made. Chavez said she expects to see a mix of vibrant, nude and sherbet colors take over at the Academy Awards. But she's excited to see what some of the newcomers will pull out on the carpet. ""There are a bunch of ... cool, young, beautiful girls experimenting with fashion,"" she said, giving a nod to Rooney Mara, who has been playing with cutouts and black and white. In the end, any celebrity can end up on a list of best- or worst-dressed stars. But the fashionistas who push the envelope are the ones we'll be talking about long after awards season.","""The Help's"" Octavia Spencer has stunned in Tadashi Shoji gowns .

I half-expect the next installment to be renamed ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn--Part 2: The Finale--2 Love or 2 Die"") grossed $62.3 million over the Wednesday-to-Sunday period, with $42 million of that coming in over the regular three-day frame. That gives the vampire drama a ten-day total of $221.3 million, ahead of the $214.3 million ""Eclipse"" had earned at the same point in its run. Other comparisons between ""Eclipse"" and ""Breaking Dawn"" are hard to draw. ""Eclipse"" opened on a Wednesday and was a summer movie, while ""Breaking Dawn"" debuted on a Friday and is playing during the Thanksgiving season. Furthermore, both of their runs contained holiday weekends in the first two frames, which make weekend-to-weekend drops difficult to compare. For the record, though, ""Breaking Dawn's"" three-day weekend drop was 70 percent from last week's $138 million opening. One thing that can be said with certainty? The ""Twilight"" franchise remains a box office juggernaut. ""Breaking Dawn's"" $10,330 per theater average was the second-highest in the Top 10, and when all is said and done, it should finish its run in the $300 million range. Disney's $40 million reboot ""The Muppets"" debuted in second place with a strong $42.3 million. The friendly felt puppets laughed up $29.5 million over the regular three-day weekend. Audiences skewed slightly older than those at typical kids' movies, as only 35 percent of viewers were under the age of 18, but then the Muppets were never meant to be solely kiddie fare â€” that's why ""Sesame Street"" was invented! ""The Muppets"" $42.3 million bow is lower than the $49.1 million opening of the Mouse House's ""Enchanted"" (which also starred Amy Adams) in 2007. Thanks to strong word-of-mouth and terrific reviews, ""Enchanted"" endured through the holiday season and wound up with a magical $127 million total. With a straight ""A"" CinemaScore grade and broad appeal with all ages, ""The Muppets"" may climb to a similar $100+ million cume in the coming weeks. Wherever ""The Muppets"" finishes though, it has already proven more successful than the last Muppets movies to hit theaters, ""Muppets from Space,"" which only earned $16.6 million in 1999. It looks like Miss Piggy might finally get the credit she's always known she deserves. Welcome back, guys! After a disappointing opening last weekend, ""Happy Feet Two"" needed a miraculous hold to save its box office prospects -- but that didn't really happen. The $135 million animated sequel earned another $18.4 million over five days and $13.4 million over three, which marks a rather large for a family film 37 percent drop. With $43.8 million after ten days, ""Happy Feet Two"" won't come close to the original's $198 million gross. Penguins -- they're just so 2006. Two more expensive children's movies rounded out the Top 5. In fourth, Sony's Aardman-produced 3-D animation ""Arthur Christmas"" unwrapped a fairly lackluster $17 million in its first five days ($12.7 million over three days). The well-reviewed $98 million production scored an ""A--"" CinemaScore grade, and while its subject matter should help it hold well throughout December, ""Arthur"" will need to post some very small declines to make up for its low $3,762 per theater average and maintain its location count. Martin Scorsese's first foray into 3-D, ""Hugo,"" began its run in fifth place. The ""adventure"" (read: homage to silent film) cost producer GK Films a reported $170 million, and Paramount is distributing. ""Hugo"" earned $15.4 million in five days, and $11.4 million over the typical weekend. While those results sound alarmingly low, the silver lining here is that ""Hugo"" is only playing in 1,277 locations -- the smaller run yielded a strong $8,888 per theater average over three days. Still, ""Hugo"" has a LOT to prove before anyone should consider calling it a success. Paramount is clearly hoping to build a strong word-of-mouth foundation which could propel the well-reviewed film in the coming weeks, and a rep for the studio tells me that Paramount plans to add a few hundred locations to its run next weekend before breaking into an extra-wide release on December 9 (that is when CinemaScore data will be available). Film buffs were apparently interested to see how Scorsese used the 3-D illusion -- according to Paramount, 75 percent of the film's gross came from 3-D screens. (According to me: a quick Fandango browse reveals that today in New York City theaters, 64 out of 77 showtimes -- that's 83 percent! -- are in 3-D. Would that mean that a 75 percent 3-D share is actually disappointing?) In limited release, ""The Descendants"" proved utterly dominant. Fox Searchlight's George Clooney drama, which is already earning a deafening amount of Oscar buzz, expanded onto 433 screens on Friday, and it increased 505 percent to $7.2 million over three days ($9.2 million over five), giving ""The Descendants"" a tremendous $16,628 per theater average and a ten-day total of $10.7 million. Fox Searchlight, more than any other arthouse studio, knows how to platform a release as audiences become engaged with the title, and Searchlight often holds back on expansion when prognosticators assume they'll push their movies wider -- they didn't put Alexander Payne's last movie, ""Sideways,"" into more than 1,000 theaters until its 15th weekend. We'll have to wait and see what the distributor does with ""The Descendants,"" but they've clearly got a hit on their hands. It should soar well past Clooney's last picture, ""The Ides of March"" ($39.5 million) and perhaps even past Clooney's 2009 Oscar bait, ""Up in the Air"" ($83 million). Fellow Oscar contender ""My Week with Marilyn"" began its run with $2.1 million in five days. The Marilyn Monroe picture earned $311,000 out of 183 theaters on Wednesday and Thursday, and then expanded into 244 theaters for the weekend, when it earned $1.8 million more. That gave it a moderately good $6,161 per theater average. Encouragingly, Marilyn ticked up by a strong 13 percent on Saturday, and then dropped by a scant 30 percent on Sunday, so word-of-mouth may be spreading quickly for the drama, which earned an ""A--"" CinemaScore grade. According to Weinstein, audiences were 65 percent female and 50 percent over the age of 50. In very limited debuts, ""The Artist"" and ""A Dangerous Method"" both posted strong numbers from just four theaters. The Artist found about $210,000 and a stunning $52,604 per theater average -- great results for any film, much less a black-and-white silent one. With strong Oscar buzz and an ""A"" CinemaScore grade working in The Artist's favor, Weinstein is planning to expand the film slowly through Christmastime. Sony Pictures Classics' A Dangerous Method, meanwhile, grossed about $182,000, for an impressive $45,463 venue average. Expect expansions for the Michael Fassbender/Viggo Mortensen/Keira Knightly film as well. One final note: Interestingly, ""Tower Heist"" seems to be enjoying a late surge of popularity. Despite losing 468 theaters this weekend, the caper clicked up 3 percent to $7.3 million over three days. The $85 million ($75 million after tax rebates) Eddie Murphy/Ben Stiller comedy, directed by Brett Ratner, has now found $65.3 million total. 1.

"London, England (CNN) -- Forty years ago London's docklands were an industrial wasteland. The shipping companies had moved to deeper waters, factories were left abandoned and poverty was rife. It's hard to believe that in just a few weeks the very same East End docks will be transformed into a St Tropez-style luxury marina worthy of the world's A-list celebrities. The mega-rich and their superyachts are set to descend on the regenerated Docklands for front row seats to the 2012 London Olympics. And high-end companies are keen to ensure no expense is spared when catering to their every whim. The exclusive experience will include helicopter transfers, speedboat taxis, a specially-constructed beach and even pontoons with private jacuzzis. Watch: The exclusive world of superyachts . ""It will be a mini Monaco,"" Benjamin Sutton from concierge service MGMT told CNN. ""In terms of location you can't get any better. We're opposite the Excel Center which will be hosting the gymnastics, basketball, wrestling. We're 5 minutes walk from the Thames Cable Car to the O2 Arena in Greenwich. And the Olympic Stadium is a 10 minute drive away. ""We have preferential tickets to first class events like track and field. We tailor the package around the individual qualms of the client. Pretty much whatever they'd expect we can offer."" The high-end service comes with a price tag to match. Berths are roughly £60 ($90) a meter per day, with a 70-meter superyacht setting you back a whopping £58,000 ($90,000) for two weeks of the Games. Celebs set sail . Among the wealthy expected at Wood Wharf, Canary Wharf, St Katharine Docks and Royal Victoria Dock in east London are Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The oligarch's superyacht Eclipse - believed to boast two helicopter pads, 20 jet skis, two swimming pools, hot tubs, a dance floor and a cinema - was previously chartered by music star couple Beyoncé, 30, and Jay-Z, 42. ""There is a rumor that George Clooney will also be arriving,"" Benjamin revealed. Though he was quick to add: ""But we can't reveal for sure who is going to be there. Privacy is very important."" Watch: Designing superyachts . And when the superyacht owners come out to play, nearby restaurant and club Waterside House will be offering them the exclusive, high-end entertainment they've come to expect. A £1,000 membership will get you into the club's Black Card lounge for the duration of the Games. It includes access to a specially built 60 meter beach and nightclub where DJ Fatboy Slim is expected to perform. ""It means by definition that the rest of the marquee is also extremely exclusive."" Waterside House founder and director Ali Warburton told CNN. ""These are very, very high-end clientele. We've got Olympic contestants, oligarchs, ambassadors, celebrities and CEOs of some of the largest companies in the world. ""Superyacht owners are all over it. They're all billionaires and there's only a certain amount of time they can spend on their boat."" London's docklands: From wasteland to luxury . It's a dramatic transformation for an area which in the 1970s had become a deserted wasteland. In fact, the grim image of a ruined city was the perfect setting for Stanley Kubrick's 1987 Vietnam war film Full Metal Jacket. The docklands had originally secured London's reputation as a great trading city and by the 1930s was the busiest port in the world. But with the emergence of bigger cargo ships in the 1960s, the shipping industry was forced to move to deep-water ports just outside London in Essex. By 1980 most of London's docks were obsolete. And it wasn't until the London Docklands Development Corporation redeveloped the site in the late 1980s -- including the financial hub of Canary Wharf -- that the docklands was reborn. Watch: The new home of sailing? The Olympic makeover is the latest development for this historic East End heartland -- one which Benjamin predicts could give it a lasting reputation. ""This is an Olympic-themed platform to launch London as a future destination for superyachts,"" he said. ""All these boats that used to go to the Med will now see London as a great place to stop off; a new launching pad for Europe.""","London's docklands to be transformed into St. Tropez-style marina for Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Australian troops could begin pulling out of Afghanistan in the coming months, and the majority of them may leave the country by the end of next year, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said Tuesday. It's the latest announcement of international troop drawdowns in Afghanistan, a trend that signals the coalition's confidence in the country's fighting forces, the transition to Afghan security control, and the war's growing unpopularity in the countries that contribute troops. Gillard made her remarks Tuesday ahead of a NATO summit meeting in Chicago in May. At the meeting, the leaders of countries with troops in Afghanistan will make key decisions about the future of the international coalition's mission there. Australia's move would mean that most of the more than 1,500 Australian soldiers in Afghanistan could leave a year earlier than the government had previously suggested. That timetable puts Australian forces on a quicker withdrawal timetable than Gillard had previously described. In a speech to parliament in November, she said the transition in Uruzgan might well be completed before the end of 2014. ""We continue to see steady gains in the fight against the Afghan insurgency,"" Gillard said in a speech in Canberra, suggesting that the strategy of international forces in the country had led to ""security gains over the past year and a half."" She highlighted the progress made by Afghan troops, notably in the southern province of Uruzgan, where most of the Australian forces are concentrated. Gillard said she expected the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, to make an announcement in the coming months about beginning the process of putting Afghan troops in charge of security in Uruzgan and other provinces, a transition that should take 12 to 18 months. ""And when this is complete, Australia's commitment in Afghanistan will look very different to that we have today,"" she said, adding that ""the majority of our troops will have returned home."" Gillard said Australia will maintain a police training role and ""provide niche training"" to the Afghan National Security Forces after 2014. ""We are prepared to consider a limited Special Forces contribution in the right circumstances and under the right mandate,"" she said. ""There may be a continuing role to train the ANSF to conduct -- and to work alongside them in carrying out -- counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan."" Australia has been among those nations that have contributed troops, supplies and other resources to the NATO-led military effort in Afghanistan, which began in the weeks after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Jeffrey Dressler, senior analyst at Institute for the Study of War, a D.C.-based think tank, said Australia has been a ""phenomenal"" ally. Its special forces contingent in Uruzgan has been responsible for numerous high-level kill and capture operations, and the military has trained and mentored Afghan security forces, Dressler said. ""They should be commended for their role,"" Dressler said. He noted that it would be ""a shame to see regression"" in Uruzgan because of what appears to be a ""hard and fast move."" Dressler hopes the transition will be phased, careful and ""condition-based"" to avoid any setbacks. ""It's important they do this in a judicious way. I hope they'll do that. It helps to have the weight of the NATO mandate behind it,"" he said. He also said such moves could influence other coalition countries to make similar moves. Australia's 1,550 troops in Afghanistan are a fraction of the overall number of foreign troops deployed to keep a lid on the country's insurgency more than 10 years after allied airstrikes marked the start of Operation Enduring Freedom. The number of Australian soldiers killed in the war stands at 32, according to a CNN count. More than 130,000 troops from 50 countries are currently operating in Afghanistan, according to the International Security and Assistance Force. The international force has been there since 2001, shortly after the al Qaeda terror attacks on the United States. The campaign was launched to stop the Taliban from providing a safe haven for al Qaeda fighters and to stop the terror group's use of Afghanistan as a base for its future activities. The United States is the biggest contributor, providing about 90,000 troops, followed by the United Kingdom with 9,500, Germany with 4,800 troops and France with 3,600. In June 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan would end by 2014. At that time, there were more than 100,000 U.S. troops in the country after a 30,000-strong troop ""surge"" in December 2009 to help bolster the campaign against the Taliban. In February, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced that the United States hoped to end its combat mission in Afghanistan in 2013, transitioning primarily to a training role as Afghan forces take more responsibility for security. France announced in February that it would begin an early drawdown, and its troops would be gone by 2013. Germany plans to pull out some troops next year, with the remainder leaving in 2014. Britain plans to hand over its security operations to local forces by the end of 2013 before continuing in a ""supporting role"" from 2014. Some countries have already pulled out. Canada, which once headed the ISAF mission, removed almost all of its 3,000 soldiers at the end of 2011. Norway also withdrew almost all of its 500 troops during this period. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Hilary Whiteman and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: Analyst calls Australia a ""phenomenal"" ally .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Secret Service has yanked the security clearances of 11 members accused of bringing prostitutes to a hotel in Colombia ahead of last week's pan-American summit, government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Monday. The investigation also involves at least five and possibly 10 U.S. military personnel who were working with the Secret Service ahead of President Barack Obama's trip to the Summit of the Americas. They are accused of bringing prostitutes to their Cartagena hotel Wednesday night, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday his personnel ""let the boss down"" with their conduct. The Secret Service agents and officers involved range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20-year veterans, and all have been interviewed at least once, two government officials with knowledge of the probe told CNN. Their security clearances have been pulled while an investigation is under way and could be reinstated if they are cleared, the officials said. Most if not all arrived in Cartagena on Wednesday, two days before Obama, and went out for drinks in several groups after arrival, the officials said. The agency, which is responsible for presidential security, has briefed key congressional leaders on the investigation so far. Rep. Peter King, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN that he believed 11 prostitutes were brought back to the hotel. Over the weekend, King told CNN that one of the women refused to leave a hotel room Thursday morning. A hotel manager tried to get in the room, and eventually the woman emerged and said ""they owed her money,"" according to King. U.S. government sources also said there was a dispute between at least one Secret Service member and a woman demanding payment. At least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police, and complaints were filed with the U.S. Embassy, the sources said. The alleged misconduct occurred before Obama arrived in Cartagena, but the news broke while he was there. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday that the incident distracted attention ""from what was a very important regional engagement for our president."" ""So we let the boss down, because nobody's talking about what went on in Colombia other than this incident,"" Dempsey said. Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, said he met with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan on Monday and said Sullivan was ""shocked"" by the accusations. ""This is an organization with a great history, a history of being disciplined,"" Issa, R-California, told CNN's ""John King USA."" But he said earlier that ""to assume that 11 people did something on a one-time basis is a little bit questionable."" For 11 people to violate a basic security premise indicates a larger problem, Issa said. The Americans don't seem to have broken the law in Colombia, where soliciting prostitutes is legal in some parts of the country, he said. But the congressman -- a leading Obama administration critic -- said the conduct could have posed a security risk to the president by exposing Secret Service agents to blackmail. ""What's legal in one country still could lead to a married man being blackmailed,"" he said. Speaking at the end of the summit on Sunday, Obama called for a ""thorough"" and ""rigorous"" investigation into the allegations. ""We're representing the people of the United States, and when we travel to another country, I expect us to observe the highest standards,"" he said. ""Obviously, what's been reported doesn't match up with those standards."" But he added, ""I'll wait until the full investigation is completed until I pass final judgment."" The Pentagon said Monday that the misconduct involved more service members than the five initially believed. Pentagon spokesman George Little could not say how many more might be involved, but he indicated the personnel might come from more than one branch of the military. Pentagon officials had originally thought only Army personnel were involved. ""We believe there may be more than five,"" Little said Monday. All were expected to return to the United States on Monday. Little said the personnel were not directly involved in presidential security and did not have any contact with Obama. He defined their role as in ""support"" of the Secret Service. Because presidential security was the overall mission, however, it is not clear whether the Pentagon will ever publicly describe what the military personnel were doing as part of their work in Colombia or what branches of the military they belonged to. An officer who was already in Colombia gathered initial facts, according to Little. A more senior officer was leaving for Colombia on Monday to continue the investigation. Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan said the agents were relieved of duty Thursday, before the president's arrival in Colombia. The agency's assistant director, Paul Morrissey, noted his agency's ""zero tolerance policy on personal misconduct."" ""This incident is not reflective of the behavior of our personnel as they travel every day throughout the country and the world performing their duties in a dedicated, professional manner,"" Morrissey said Saturday. ""We regret any distraction from the Summit of the Americas this situation has caused.""","Secret Service staff members stripped of security clearances during the probe .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William asked his girlfriend Kate Middleton to marry him, he said Tuesday, setting up the most anticipated royal wedding since Prince Charles and Diana, princess of Wales, got married nearly 30 years ago. William gave Diana's sapphire-and-diamond engagement ring to his fiancee when he popped the question during a vacation in Kenya last month, he said. ""It's my mother's engagement ring, so of course it's very special to me, and Kate's now very special to me, so it was only right to put the two together,"" he said Tuesday. ""It was a total shock"" when the prince proposed, Middleton said, adding that she was very excited. ""We were out there with friends and things, so I really didn't expect it at all."" The ring, a huge sapphire surrounded by diamonds, was last seen in public on the day Charles and Diana divorced, royal biographer Mark Saunders told CNN. That was in 1996. William said there was ""no pressure"" for Middleton to emulate Diana. ""It's about carving your own future,"" he said. ""No one is trying to fill my mother's shoes."" The couple seemed happy and relaxed in their first interview after announcing the engagement Tuesday, teasing each other about his cooking and his romanticism, each drawing laughter from the other. Tuesday's announcement ends years of speculation about whether and when the prince -- who is second in line to the British throne -- would propose to his longtime girlfriend. The prince and Middleton, both 28, have been dating since 2003. ""It was the right time and I'm very glad to have done it,"" William said in an appearance with Middleton. ""We're obviously thrilled,"" said William's father Prince Charles. ""They've been practicing long enough."" ""They make a lovely couple, they're great fun to be with and we've had a lot of laughs together,"" said Middleton's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton. ""We've got to know William really well. We all think he's wonderful and we're extremely fond of him."" The wedding will take place in London in the spring or summer of 2011, Charles's office at Clarence House said. It said further details would be announced ""in due course."" ""Prince William and Miss Middleton became engaged in October during a private holiday in Kenya,"" the statement said. ""Prince William has informed the queen and other close members of his family. Prince William has also sought the permission of Miss Middleton's father. ""Following the marriage, the couple will live in north Wales, where Prince William will continue to serve with the Royal Air Force."" William's grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, are ""absolutely delighted for them both,"" Buckingham Palace said. His brother Prince Harry said he was ""delighted that my brother has popped the question! It means I get a sister, which I have always wanted."" Clarence House refused to say what Middleton will be called after she gets married, saying any styles and titles are at the discretion of the queen. William met Middleton in 2002 when both were students at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. They started dating a year later. Prince William studied geography and Middleton studied history of art before both graduated in 2005. William was originally in the same art program but changed to geography; Middleton was widely credited with persuading him to change course rather than drop out. They first appeared as a couple on a skiing trip in Switzerland while still at the university. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he spoke to Prince William after the news was announced and passed on his congratulations. ""It's great to have a piece of unadulterated good news that everyone can celebrate,"" Cameron said. ""I'm sure it will be something where the country will come together. ... It's two young people who love each other who've made this decision, and it's a fantastically important and exciting moment for them, too."" Middleton grew up in Bucklebury, England, a small village about 45 miles west of central London. Her parents are millionaire entrepreneurs who run Party Pieces, an online children's party supplies business. After university, Middleton worked in London as an accessories buyer for the British clothing chain Jigsaw but left the company in late 2007. Media reports said she was interested in opening a photography gallery. She is working now with her parents' business, she said. Prince William has a military career and is active in several charities. In September, he graduated from a military search-and-rescue training course and was posted to RAF Valley, the station on the island of Anglesey in north Wales. He is known as Flight Lieutenant Wales within the RAF. Middleton lives with her fiance at a house in Anglesey, giving them some privacy from the press and paparazzi, said Eve Pollard, a former editor of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. The choice of 2011 as the year for the wedding makes sense, she said, because two major events are already scheduled for the following year. The Olympic Games take place in London in 2012, the same year the queen plans to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee, marking 60 years on the throne. ""Next year was always marked in as the year,"" Pollard said. Nicholas Davies, the author of ""William: The Rebel Prince,"" said he thinks William was pressured to come through with the engagement. ""I do believe this came down from the queen and Prince Philip, who is still a very strong character despite his venerable age,"" Davies told CNN. ""They would have said, 'This has gone on long enough. The press knows you're getting married. It's about time you came out and made it known.'"" As for when in 2011 the couple will marry, Clarence House refused to speculate. Bookmakers Paddy Power on Tuesday were offering 3-1 odds on August 13, 2011, being the wedding date, and 4-1 odds on August 6. It said Saturday, July 30, was less likely, at 10-1 odds, because it falls just a day after the 30th anniversary of the wedding of Charles and Diana. The location for the wedding was also being kept secret, though Richard Fitzwilliams, a public relations consultant and royal commentator, told CNN he expects it to happen at Westminster Abbey, probably in July. William and Middleton broke up in April 2007, despite widespread speculation even then that they were close to marriage. The split was said to be amicable, with the couple determined to remain friends, and the two appeared together in the royal box at Wembley Stadium that July for the Concert for Diana, a charity event to remember William's mother 10 years after her death. The pair were seen together several more times that summer and were dating again by the end of the year. Middleton's family is seen as upper-middle class. Such a background bodes well for her future role at the side of the future king, according to Lady Colin Campbell, who wrote a biography of Princess Diana. ""The problem with recent royal brides who were aristocratic is that they thought they were doing the royal family a favor by marrying them,"" she told CNN, ""while the middle-class girls like Sophie Wessex, the countess of Wessex (married to Prince Charles' brother, Edward), and Kate Middleton understand that to be royal requires some sacrifice, and they do not suffer from folie de grandeur [delusion of greatness] the way aristocratic girls evidently do nowadays."" William biographer Davies, however, said he feels the opposite about Middleton, who he said lacks the ""charisma"" shown by William's mother. ""Remember that this young lady has no royal connections whatsoever, and that can be a danger,"" he said. But journalist Pollard said William chose his bride carefully. ""I think the queen's understood that it's very important for William to make a happy marriage,"" Pollard told CNN. ""He watched his parents be unhappy, and the fact that they [William and Middleton] have stayed together for so long and they have been together for so long rather proves that they get on very well."" CNN's Melissa Gray and Phil Han in London, England; Dan Rivers in Dorset, England; and Michael Pearson and Arthur Brice in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","NEW: William's brother Harry is delighted to be getting a sister at last, he says .

"(CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board's big, bold stroke encouraging all states to prohibit drivers from using cell phones faces a long, tortuous process in the nation's statehouses, experts said Wednesday. This political reality stands out: Since states began legislating distracted driving or cell phone use in 2000, none has gone so far as to impose a complete ban on mobile devices behind the wheel, and only one state -- Alaska -- has considered such a blanket prohibition, just this year, said Anne Teigen, senior policy specialist with National Conference of State Legislatures. Barbara Harsha, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, said opponents don't like big government intrusions and savor their personal freedoms. ""This is a controversial issue so you can assume it's not going to pass right away,"" Harsha said. ""It's going to take a long time for legislatures to pass laws, and a long time for states to begin to enforce the laws, and then a long time for behavior to start to change. ""The first seat-belt law was passed in the mid-'80s, and we're now at 84 percent of drivers who are buckled up nationwide,"" even though all states now have laws requiring drivers and passengers to wear seat belts, Harsha said. ""People like to be connected. They like to respond to e-mails and voice mail,"" Harsha said. States won't embrace such a blanket ban recommended by the NTSB, said David Adkins, executive director and CEO of The Council of State Governments. Lawmakers believe that constituents and trade groups alike view such a total ban as excessive, he said. ""It's just one of those things that would be the equivalent of the 18th Amendment today. It's a Prohibition that would not work,"" Adkins said. ""I don't believe most state lawmakers would say (the NTSB recommendation) is viable,"" Adkins said. ""To check to see what's for dinner and who's going to pick up the kids, those are so ingrained as conveniences in our daily lives, to say that we're not going to allow you to connect, that seems so unrealistic."" Still, Adkins praised the NTSB initiative as ""boldly aspirational."" ""If it gets people's attention, it will do good,"" he said. ""I just hope they pursue their campaign through cooperation and collaboration rather than preemption or mandates on the states, in other words forcing it down the states' throats."" NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman acknowledged that the recommended ban is ""a challenge"" that ""will take some time."" Another NTSB board member said the proposal's target -- distracted driving -- is ""the new DUI."" ""I know how difficult this is because I used to talk on my phone, as well, until I understood the dangers of it,"" Hersman told CNN on Wednesday. ""And I'll tell you, when I hung up my phone and stopped talking on the phone while I was driving, it was like becoming sober and seeing that everyone around you was drinking. You notice the people who are distracted."" In the past 10 years the NTSB has increasingly sought to limit the use of portable electronic devices -- recommending bans for novice drivers, school bus drivers and commercial truckers. Tuesday's recommendation, if adopted by states, would outlaw nonemergency phone calls and texting by operators of every vehicle on the road. The initiative would apply to hands-free as well as hand-held devices, but devices installed in the vehicle by the manufacturer would be allowed, the NTSB said. The recommendation would not affect passengers' rights to use such devices . The Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, hasn't taken a position on the NTSB recommendation because the association would like to see more research. ""There's conflicting evidence"" on whether hands-free cell phone conversations would be as unsafe as those by hand-helds, Harsha said, adding that more ""definitive research"" is needed. ""If it shows both are unsafe, then a total ban may make the most sense,"" she said. So far, nine states and the District of Columbia prohibit hand-held cell phones while driving, Teigen said. A 10th state, Utah, has deemed speaking on a hand-held phone as a careless driving offense if it is accompanied by another moving violation, Harsha said. Thirty states and the District of Columbia prohibit novice drivers and teenagers from using cell phones while driving, but no state has imposed such a ban on all drivers, Teigen said. One cell phone industry group supports states' ban on texting while driving -- a law enacted in 35 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. But the CTIA-The Wireless Association didn't take a position on the NTSB's recommended ban on cell phone conversations behind the wheel. ""Manual texting while driving is clearly incompatible with safety, which is why we have historically supported a ban on texting while driving. As far as talking on wireless devices while driving, we defer to state and local lawmakers and their constituents as to what they believe are the most appropriate laws where they live,"" Steve Largent, president and CEO of the industry group, said in a statement. In Alaska, state Rep. Mike Doogan, a Democrat, this year proposed legislation that would ban using a cell phone when driving, but the measure died, he said. ""I'm very happy to see that the NTSB has taken notice of what is clearly a problem that basically anyone who is on the road can recognize themselves. It's important that a national organization is getting involved. Otherwise, it's a state-by-state slog, and that slog hasn't been going so well, including in Alaska,"" Doogan said. The federal government last month banned interstate truck and bus drivers from using cell phones while driving. A violation carries a federal fine of $2,750.","NTSB has encouraged all states to prohibit drivers from using cell phones .
States will be reluctant to impose a total ban on cell phones behind the wheel, experts say .
Experts: Seat-belt laws met with resistance, and cell phones' convenience is ""ingrained""
Only in Alaska has a blanket prohibition been considered, and it went nowhere ."
"(CNN) -- The attorney for George Zimmerman says he is confident his motion to have a Florida judge removed from his client's case will be granted. ""I think she's going to go ahead and grant it and move the case on to another judge,"" Mark O'Mara, the lawyer, said Monday night. Zimmerman's defense team formally requested Monday that Seminole Circuit Judge Jessica Recksiedler, the Florida judge assigned to their client's case, be removed after she revealed her husband works with a CNN legal analyst. O'Mara's office filed paperwork Monday asking that Recksiedler not preside over second-degree murder proceedings involving Zimmerman and the motion to ""disqualify"" the trial judge ""will be ruled on in the appropriate manner,"" a court official said. Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, fatally shot teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, February 26, a killing he has said was in self-defense. Since then, the case has stirred civil rights activists nationwide and drawn intense publicity. Bill Cosby: Guns, not race, key issue in Martin case . Recksiedler is assigned to the Zimmerman case. But on Friday, she said she would entertain motions to disqualify her from the trial because her husband is a law partner of Mark NeJame, an attorney whom Zimmerman approached about representing him and has since widely commented on the case in the media. NeJame is now a CNN contributor, providing analysis on this case. NeJame told CNN that Zimmerman ""contacted my office, attempting to reach me, and wanted to hire me to represent him"" on March 13. One of his law partners relayed that request to NeJame, who declined. He explained later that he knew how taking on ""big national cases (can) take a lot out of you"" and wanted to have more time to spend with his children. ""I decided simply not to,"" the Orlando lawyer said. A friend of Zimmerman's later repeated the request in a direct conversation with NeJame early last week, just as lawyers Hal Uhrig and Craig Sonner said they'd no longer represent Zimmerman. By then, NeJame noted he'd been hired by CNN to serve as an analyst. NeJame again said he could not represent Zimmerman and offered the names of five lawyers -- topped by O'Mara -- who might be considered instead. ""They said Mark is the one we want, I put them together, and they took it from there,"" said NeJame. He acknowledged Tuesday, ""it's an appearance of a conflict, an appearance of an impropriety"" for Recksiedler to preside over the case. But, he said he thought she did nothing improper by waiting for a request from attorneys instead of offering to recuse herself first. ""I don't think she did anything out of the ordinary for this extraordinary situation,"" he said. Meanwhile, news media organizations, including CNN, petitioned Recksiedler Monday to reverse an order sealing court records in Zimmerman's prosecution. Prosecutors did not object when Zimmerman's attorneys asked Recksiedler to seal records last week. The judge ordered the court filings and other records sealed ""without giving the public and press an opportunity to oppose closure,"" the media said in its motion. Florida law requires a judge to consider whether the records closure is needed to ""prevent a serious and imminent threat"" to justice, the media members argued. The court must also find that there is no alternative to sealing the records that would provide a fair trial and that the action would not be ""broader than necessary to accomplish this purpose,"" they said. Older brother: Trayvon was a happy teen . In addition to CNN, several broadcasting and newspaper companies -- including the publishers of USA Today, the Miami Herald and The New York Times -- are part of the effort to unseal the documents. O'Mara said Monday that he favors keeping documents sealed in this case in large part because of concerns that witnesses might be contacted and in danger if certain information is released. ""(Our) overall philosophy (is) to keep the information flow concentrated within the court system,"" he told CNN. ""It's much better handled there."" As to his client, O'Mara said he speaks ""at least a couple times a day"" with Zimmerman, whom he described as doing well physically but ""frightened."" Zimmerman is scheduled to return to court Friday for a bail hearing. O'Mara says he hopes his client will be eligible for bond after that hearing and eventually be allowed to go free until the trial. If he does get out, though, the lawyer said there are legitimate fears about Zimmerman's safety. ""There have been a lot of emotions that have come forward in this case, and some of those emotions have shown themselves in bad ways,"" O'Mara said.","The judge in the case is connected to a CNN analyst .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik boasted Tuesday that he had carried out ""the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack in Europe since World War II"" when he killed 77 people in Norway last summer. And he would do it again if he had the chance, ""because offenses against my people and my fellow partisans are in many ways as bad,"" Breivik told the court on the second day of his trial. He planned his killings as a suicide attack, he said. ""I didn't expect to survive that day,"" he said. Breivik faces trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22 rampage. Eight people died in a bombing in central Oslo, then 69 people were systematically gunned down at a youth camp on nearby Utoya Island. Breivik testified in closed court a day after declaring that he had carried out the massacre but was not guilty because the killings had been necessary. He was allowed to read a prepared statement in court Tuesday, taking considerably longer than the 30 minutes he was allotted. He rejected what he said would be prosecution efforts to portray him as a ""pathetic and mean loser"" and an ""antisocial psychopath."" He said he represented a ""European resistance movement"" and ""Europeans who don't want our ethnic rights to be taken away."" His lawyer, Geir Lippestad, said Breivik's statement was ""hard to hear, and it is difficult to understand."" But he said it was important to the trial, since his client wants people to see him as sane. ""It is probably because of his ideology and his thoughts about why he has done what he has done,"" Lippestad said. ""He thinks that it won't have any effect if he is considered insane."" Breivik's trial on is expected to last up to 10 weeks. A court translator initially said Breivik was claiming self-defense as the justification, but court officials corrected that Tuesday, saying the correct legal term was ""necessity."" ""He is very satisfied that he has been able to explain himself today as he wished,"" Lippestad said. ""It was very important for him to be allowed to read his written explanation that he had prepared. Now we will have four, five days where he can explain himself orally."" Experts have given different opinions about Breivik's sanity, which will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted. Sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility. Under examination by prosecutors, he claimed to be linked to two other individuals in Norway who are associated with the so-called Knights Templar ultranationalist movement. He said ""militant nationalists"" had drawn tactical inspiration from Osama bin Laden's terror network. ""We've taken a bit from al Qaeda and militant Islamists, including the glorification of martyrdom"" and organization into one-man cells, Breivik said. He denied that what he called the ""militant nationalist"" movement was evil. ""We don't act to be evil. We're trying to save our nations, our ethnic group and our culture,"" he said. Most of the relatives of the victims did not want Breivik's remarks televised, and presiding Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen rejected Breivik's claim that airing it was a human right. She ruled that his testimony would not be broadcast, and court papers indicated the five judge hearing the case did not want the trial to become a platform for Breivik to air his political views, or for them to distract from the legal issues involved. One of the judges was disqualified before the hearing began for saying online that the death penalty was the right punishment for Breivik. Both the prosecution and defense asked that Thomas Indrebo be removed for leaving a comment on a news website that ""only the death penalty"" would be the right thing in the case. Norway does not have the death penalty. Indrebo was one of three lay judges on the panel of five, along with two professional judges. Breivik says his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians. In a 1,500-page manifesto attributed to him, Breivik railed against Muslim immigration and European liberalism -- including the ruling Labour Party, which he said was allowing the ""Islamification of Europe."" Prosecutors on Monday played a recording of a terrified girl phoning for help during the shooting rampage, a recording punctuated by constant firing in the background. They also showed security camera video of the central Oslo bomb blast that killed eight people, images that participants in the trial watched with ashen faces. Breivik sat in court without restraints, behind a bulletproof glass barrier set up to protect him during the proceedings. He appeared to be overcome with emotion, fighting back tears, when part of his video manifesto ""Knights Templar 2083"" was played in court. On Tuesday, he said he wept as he watched the film because he was thinking about his country and ethnic group dying. Lawyers for the victims had said Monday that ""No one thought he was crying for the victims."" Lippestad said the trial ""is going very well so far, in a very ordered way."" ""It is no circus, and you can tell that this is a dignified and good way to determine his guilt,"" he said. CNN's Per Nyberg and Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: Breivik's statement is ""hard to hear, and it is difficult to understand,"" his attorney says .

"(CNN) -- Investigators asked for help Thursday as they searched for a man seen in a mall in Littleton, Colorado, shortly before what they described as a possible attempt to bomb the shopping center on the 12th anniversary of the shooting at nearby Columbine High School. Authorities told reporters at a news conference that the man they are seeking is a ""person of interest,"" and they asked for help from the news media and public in identifying him. No evidence exists so far of a link to the Columbine shootings, Jefferson County Sheriff Ted Mink said, but he acknowledged the possibility was on the minds of law enforcement officials. ""There's not a definite link that we have right now to anything at Columbine other than the date,"" Mink said, adding that the April 20th anniversary of the shootings ""is fresh on everyone's mind."" A security camera shows the man sought by authorities in the mall just minutes before a security guard noticed a fire. Investigators say that fire may have been part of an attempt to detonate explosives. The incident happened Wednesday at the Southwest Plaza Mall, less than two miles from Columbine High School. It came on the 12th anniversary of the shooting at Columbine that left 12 students and a teacher dead at the hands of two other students, who then killed themselves. ""It's sort of scary, but it's also ... terrible,"" said David Cullen, author of the book ""Columbine"" about the massacre. ""It's like attacking people who are in mourning."" Law-enforcement officials released surveillance camera images of a man carrying a white plastic bag at the mall around noon. He was in a part of the mall that the public does not usually access. Only minutes after he was seen in the area, a security guard noticed a small fire there and quickly put it out.  A subsequent search turned up explosives, said Jacki Kelley of the Jefferson County Sheriff's office. ""The propane tanks and the pipe bomb were literally together,"" she told reporters Wednesday night at a news conference. The mall was quickly evacuated and no one was hurt, authorities said. Mink said that the mall had been thoroughly searched and was allowed to reopen on Thursday. None of the authorities who spoke at the news conference provided further information on the explosives found at the scene, saying they needed to interview more people and didn't want details reported in the media to influence any responses they might get. The situation could have been much worse, said Dave Joly, a spokesman for the FBI. ""Depending (on) if it went off and actively combusted as what it was set to do, it could have been more serious than it was,"" he said at an earlier news conference, adding that it appeared that the pipe bomb was supposed to be a trigger to detonate the propane tanks. ""This was potentially devastating to a very high populated area, and very difficult to ignore the day that today is,"" Kelley added. ""We're not ignoring that.  The date is significant to Colorado history,"" Joly added. Schools in the area were briefly put on lockdown, according to the sheriff's office. Columbine High School was already closed Wednesday, for what its school calendar called a staff development day. The person authorities want to talk to is described as a white male with gray hair and a silver mustache, the FBI said. He wore a dark cap with a light-colored logo on the front, a gray and white horizontally striped shirt, a dark jacket, jeans and dark-colored shoes. ""We're not sure if he's a suspect or a possible witness,"" Kelley said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Violent crime in the United States declined 6% last year, according to statistics compiled by the FBI and released Monday. Despite difficult economic conditions, the 2010 figures show a continuing decline in violent incidents nationwide, which have been dropping annually since 2006. There were slightly fewer than 1.25 million violent crimes in the United States in 2010, a 6% decline from calendar year 2009. Since 2001, violent incidents have now dropped 13.4%. This past year the closely watched murder totals dropped about 4.2%, from 15,399 in 2009 to 14,748 in 2010. The FBI says despite the improvement, a murder occurs in the United States every 35 minutes. Violence flared slightly more in the South than in other regions of the country, according to the FBI statistics. In other violent crime categories, aggravated assaults were down 4.1%, rape declined 5%, and robbery dropped 10%. In non-violent crimes, the FBI said property crime declined 2.7%. Both auto theft and arson were down more than 7%. Criminologists anticipated the continued decline after preliminary figures for the first half of 2010 were released this spring, showing a 5.5% drop in violent incidents reported to police. The FBI compiles the figures from about 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the country, but does not provide explanations for changes in levels of crime. When population increases are factored into the statistics, officials note that the rate of crimes committed per 100,000 inhabitants shows an even larger decline -- 6.5% -- from the rate of violence reported in 2009. Independent academics and criminologists speculated on a wide range of possibilities for the decreases. Among reasons cited in conversations with CNN were an aging population, stepped-up community policing practices, local and federal government programs targeted at youths and programs aimed at newly released prison parolees. Nonetheless, the criminologists say high unemployment and housing issues that might have been expected to be factors have not noticeably affected the crime statistics.","The downward trend in violent crime continues in 2010, the FBI says .
Criminologists say an economic slump has not affected crime statistics .

"(CNN) -- Russia's top diplomat took a shot at the Western and Arab attempts to bring democratic change to Syria on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov singled out the Friends of the Syrian People, a coalition of dozens of nations led by the United States and the Arab League calling for tough action against the Damascus regime. ""There are outside forces that are not interested in the success of the current U.N. Security Council efforts,"" Lavrov told reporters. ""They are trying everything possible to substitute the Security Council with various unofficial formats such as the 'Friends of Syria' or some other forms. ""And (they are trying), with everything possible, to influence the Syrian opposition so that it doesn't work with the government in maintaining a cease-fire and setting up future dialogue."" Lavrov made the remarks as monitors tried to observe a U.N.-backed cease-fire that was supposed to have been in effect since Thursday. They are reviewing the government and opposition forces' adherence to the cease-fire forged by U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan. A halt in violence is part of Annan's six-point peace plan, which also calls for unimpeded humanitarian access and an ""inclusive Syrian-led political process."" ""It is the Syrian government's responsibility to guarantee freedom of access and freedom of movement within the country for these observers. They should be allowed to freely move to any places where they will be able to observe the cessation of violence,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in Luxembourg on Tuesday. Annan's effort is supported by the Syrian regime, Russia, China, the United States, Turkey and the Arab world. Analysis: U.N. diplomacy strengthens al-Assad . Despite a relative drop-off in reported deaths immediately after the Thursday cease-fire deadline, violence persisted in Syria on Tuesday, the 66th anniversary of the country's independence from France. At least 70 people were found dead across the country Tuesday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Most of those slain were found in Idlib province and other deaths occurred in Homs, Daraa and Damascus. Some of those in Idlib were killed during Monday shelling, but their bodies were not discovered and identified until Tuesday, the opposition group said. Abu Faris, an activist in the volatile city of Homs, said the military is firing rockets and mortars at the Homs neighborhoods of Khalidya and al Bayda. ""Today we have witnessed some of the worst attacks on Khalidya,"" he said. ""It is absolutely unbearable."" Abu Mahmoud, an opposition activist in the southern province of Daraa, said the opposition Free Syrian Army fighters have held their fire since the cease-fire began but the government has continued what he described as aggressive acts in Daraa, as well as Homs. He called the regime's claim that it is reacting to the activities of armed gangs ""a big lie"" and believes the killing and shelling will persist. ""I don't think everything is going to be OK,"" Mahmoud said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency has consistently blamed ""armed terrorist groups"" for the violence and said aggression by the groups had ""hysterically escalated"" since the start of the cease-fire. But activist groups every day have cited killings by government security forces. ""I think it's clear that over the last several days, particularly since Saturday, the violence has escalated,"" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice told CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Rice, John McCain talk Syria with Amanpour . Rice said the cease-fire is not holding. When asked whether that spells the end of the Annan mission, Rice said no, but that a shaky cease-fire certainly puts it in jeopardy. Rice stressed, as she has before, U.S. opposition to military intervention in Syria. ""We're rightly very apprehensive about increasing the militarization of this conflict. It's already a hot war. It could spill over,"" she said. Syria has been engulfed in violence for 13 months as a national uprising spread after the government began cracking down on peaceful protests. The United Nations estimates at least 9,000 people have died since the protests began, while others put the death toll at more than 11,000. Analysis: U.N. observer mission won't change endgame . CNN cannot independently verify reports of violence and deaths, as the government has severely restricted access by international media. The United States and the United Nations have slammed the crackdown, and there have been international calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to leave office. Russia, long a staunch ally of Syria, and China have thwarted tough Security Council action against Damascus, including calls for the president to step down. After those countries vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution in February, the United States, Arab nations, Turkey and other groups formed Friends of the Syrian People, an initiative to bring democratic change to the nation. The group backs the efforts of the Syrian National Council -- an opposition movement with strong backing among Syrian activists and citizens -- and other opposition groups to pursue a democratic system. Representatives from one opposition group, the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change, visited Russia on Tuesday. The group's leader, Hasan Abdul Azim, said the Annan plan is the ""last chance"" for peace in Syria, Russian media reported. He is quoted as saying that the ""Syrian dialogue needs"" help from international groups such as the United Nations and the Arab League. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, describes the coordination committee, based in Syria, as an ""older opposition"" that doesn't have the mass grass-roots and youth support of the Syrian National Council. However, he said, ""this is the established opposition the regime would rather dialogue with."" Annan was in Qatar on Tuesday to participate in an Arab League meeting on Syria, according to the state-run news agency in Qatar. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem ""will pay a working visit to China"" on Wednesday at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, China's state-run Xinhua news agency said. A group focused on imposing sanctions against the Syrian regime convened in Paris on Tuesday, a meeting co-chaired by France, Morocco and a European Union unit. The International Working Group on Sanctions reiterated moves made in Tunis by the Friends of the Syrian People to implement various ""restrictive measures."" It strongly disapproved ""of any financial and other support to the Syrian regime and in particular ongoing arms sales."" The group also welcomed ""sanctions adopted by the EU, the Arab League, the United States of America, Turkey, Norway, Switzerland, Monaco, Croatia, Iceland, Canada, Australia and Japan"" against Syria and urged those in the Friends of the Syrian People group and ""states that have not yet exerted the necessary pressure to join these efforts and further isolate the Syrian regime.""

"(CNN) -- Having fended off sheriffs, car racers, backwoods locals and more during his long career on the silver screen, actor Burt Reynolds is successfully fighting flu symptoms in a Florida hospital, his representative said Saturday. Reynolds was dehydrated and suffering from flu symptoms when he went to the hospital, then was transferred to its intensive care unit, his representative Erik Kritzer said Friday. By the next day, Reynolds' fever had gone down as his overall condition improved, the representative said. Still, he remained in the ICU on Saturday evening. ""He is feeling better,"" Kritzer said, predicting that Reynolds would be released Monday from the hospital. The representative has declined to divulge what hospital the actor was in, saying Reynolds wanted to keep that information private. Born in southern Georgia, Reynolds and his family moved to Michigan and eventually to southeastern Florida, according to his profile on the website of the Florida Artists Hall of Fame, in which he was inducted in 1993. At Palm Beach High School, he first made a name for himself as a football star and earned an athletic scholarship to Florida State University. When injuries derailed his promising athletic career, Reynolds turned to acting. He scored small parts in the late 1950s, then broke through a few years later in the role of Quint on the TV series ""Gunsmoke."" His career took another leap with the 1972 release of ""Deliverance,"" in which he played an Atlanta businessman exploring the remote north Georgia wilderness with friends. ""The Longest Yard"" came out two years later, starring Reynolds as an ex-football player who lands in prison. Get the latest update on the flu . His charismatic notoriety soared through the late 1970s and into the 1980s, during which he spearheaded the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Cannonball Run"" movie franchises. While his popularity waned relatively, Reynolds continued to score movie and TV roles into the 1990s. That included on ""Evening Shade,"" where he earned an Emmy in 1991 playing Wood Newton -- once again, a former football player. His lone Oscar nomination came in 1998, in the best supporting actor category, for his portrayal of pornographic film producer Jack Horner in the film ""Boogie Nights.""

"(CNNMéxico) -- Mexican food was the great star of the second state dinner held in the Obama administration. In honor of President Felipe Calderon, the menu was Mexican dishes made from iconic American ingredients with herbs and vegetables that were grown in the White House gardens. Who would dare surprise a Mexican president with Mexican dishes in Washington? The chosen chef was Rick Bayless, one of the great gurus of Mexican cuisine in the United States, who has popularized his dishes through his TV program, six cookbooks and, of course, his three restaurants: the casual Frontera Grill, the four-star Topolobampo and the newly opened Xoco. His restaurants are in Chicago, and the Obamas were regular patrons before the couple moved to Washington. Still, the James Beard Award-winning chef was surprised to be invited to their new home. ""I could hardly believe it. I kept going back to see if I actually had been invited or if it was a mistake ... no, it is an amazing honor to be invited to cook at the White House,"" Bayless said in an interview with CNNMéxico. The evening's dishes were carefully chosen after consulting with first lady Michelle Obama and executive White House chef Cristeta Comerford. ""We started with menus that we knew that the president and first lady had enjoyed, things that they have enjoyed they were at our restaurants. And we put two or three different menus because I didn't know how they did the service at the White House, and you have to make the menu tailored to the way the kitchen is set up. You can't do all things in all kitchens,"" Bayless explained. ""We learned that we couldn't serve soup because we knew that the first lady really enjoyed the tortilla soup, the soup that we do, but she said it was too hard to serve for 200 because the service is really fast."" And finally, what was the menu? The guests began their dinner with a Jicama salad with oranges, grapefruit and pineapple citrus vinaigrette served with a Chardonnay Ulisis Valdez Russian River 2007. This was followed by an herb green ceviche of Hawaiian opah (fish) with sesame-cilantro crackers. The main dish was Oregon Wagyu beef in Oaxacan black mole accompanied by black bean tamalon and grilled green beans, paired with a Cabernet Sauvignon Herrera Selección Rebecca 2006. Finally, dessert was chocolate-cajeta tart with toasted homemade marshmallows, graham cracker crumble and goat cheese ice cream accompanied by a Mumm Napa Carlos Santana Brut champagne. ""The whole idea about a state dinner -- and people don't usually understand this -- but when you are hosting a dignatary from a foreign country it is not common to serve food from their country. It is common to serve them the best of American cuisine, because you are hosting them,"" Bayless said. ""It's huge departure for Obama administration to have served food of Mexico, but they did it because of my work, I have really brought the true flavors from Mexico to the United States... however, we did feature a number of fabulous American ingredients like the opah  from Hawaii and the Wagyu from Oregon."" ""I loved it... it was such a great menu that we are going to put that menu as one of our tasting menus in Topolobampo in a couple of weeks"", said Bayless, who was born in Oklahoma City but  lived in Mexico from 1980 to 1986. Of all the praises chef Bayless received for the dinner, two made him particularly happy. One, from Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala, ""who said that she loved the ceviche verde that we did, she told me that two or three times that she loved that ceviche."" The other, from President Calderon, ""who said that it was one of the best mole negro he had ever had,"" said Bayless. The White House blogged about the dinner . That mole was precisely the most complicated part of the dinner, not only because it takes more than 20 ingredients and seven hours to make, but also for another reason. ""I didn't want the flavors of the toasting chiles and things like that to get out of the kitchen and waft the White House. I thought it was inappropriate to do that. Cris Comerford, the chef there, she ensured me that they had really good exhaust systems and she was right, it took all those aromas out, but I toasted the chiles just a few at a time so the aroma would not leak out of the kitchen,"" Bayless added. At the end, the labor was well worth it because, the chef said, ""It's one of the best moles I have ever made.""

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A duet Michael Jackson recorded with Akon was released Monday as the first official single from the upcoming album ""Michael,"" a collection of previously unpublished songs from the late pop star. A note handwritten by Jackson was found after his death indicating his desire that ""Hold My Hand,"" recorded in 2007, be the first single on his next project, Epic Records said. Taj Jackson, the singer's nephew, posted an online message Sunday saying it was the last song his uncle ever played for him in person. ""He was so proud of it,"" Taj Jackson said. ""I'll never forget that smile he had on his face as the song played through the speakers [in his room] at the Palms Hotel in Vegas."" Marc Minor who considers himself a lifelong Jackson fan said he was pleased with the song and that he looked forward to more unreleased work the singer left behind. ""I saw the 'This is It' movie and I thought that was it,"" said Minor of South Orange, New Jersey, early Monday morning. ""I think it's a tremendous legacy he's leaving that he's got all these ideas and gifts to share with the world. I am excited to know that I can hear more things he's doing even though his life was cut short."" The song is familiar to Jackson fans because an unfinished version leaked onto the Internet in 2008, but Akon returned to the studio to complete a new version, Epic said. ""The world was not ready to hear 'Hold My Hand' when it leaked a couple years ago,"" Akon said. ""We were devastated about it."" The song is now in ""its final state,"" Akon said. ""It has become an incredible, beautiful, anthemic song,"" he said. ""I'm so proud to have had the chance to work with Michael, one of my all-time idols."" The song was unveiled on www.michaeljackson.com on Monday at 12:01 a.m. ET. It is available for purchase by digital download, the company said. Earlier, the site streamed another song, ""Breaking News,"" as a preview. ""Michael,"" Jackson's first album of new music in nine years, will also include duets with rapper 50 Cent and rocker Lenny Kravitz, according to Epic. It will be released on December 14. The 10-track album will mostly include ""songs that Michael worked on recently. There are also earlier compelling tracks,"" Epic said. Jackie Jackson, one of the singer's older brothers, worked with Epic to help prepare the album, a spokesman for the estate said. Sony's Music, the parent of Epic Records, has a contract with Jackson's estate for 10 albums of unreleased material over the next seven years.","""Hold My Hand"" is the first official single of the""Michael"" album .

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain's senior domestic policy adviser said Tuesday that the BlackBerry mobile e-mail device was a ""miracle that John McCain helped create."" The adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, discussing the nation's economic woes with reporters, said that McCain -- who has struggled to stress his economic credentials -- did have experience dealing with the economy, pointing to his time on the Senate Commerce Committee. Pressed to provide an example of what McCain had accomplished on that committee, Holtz-Eakin said the senator did not have jurisdiction over financial markets, then he held up his Blackberry, telling reporters: ""He did this."" ""Telecommunications of the United States, the premiere innovation in the past 15 years, comes right through the Commerce Committee. So you're looking at the miracle that John McCain helped create,"" Holtz-Eakin said. ""And that's what he did. He both regulated and deregulated the industry."" During the 2000 presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore drew controversy when he said that during his time in Congress, he ""took the initiative in creating the Internet"" -- based on his work promoting funding and early research in that area. The Obama campaign responded to the McCain adviser's comments Tuesday shortly after they were reported. ""If John McCain hadn't said that 'the fundamentals of our economy are strong' on the day of one of our nation's worst financial crises, the claim that he invented the BlackBerry would have been the most preposterous thing said all week,"" said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton. Meanwhile, McCain senior aide Matt McDonald said that the senator ""laughed"" when he heard the comment. ""He would not claim to be the inventor of anything, much less the BlackBerry. This was obviously a boneheaded joke by a staffer,"" McDonald said. The Obama campaign debuted an ad last week that attacked McCain's skills with technology, including computers. The ad refers to the number of years McCain has been in Washington to paint him as out of touch: ""1982. John McCain goes to Washington,"" the announcer says. ""Things have changed in the last 26 years. But McCain hasn't. ""He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send an e-mail. Still doesn't understand the economy. And favors $200 billion in new tax cuts for corporations but almost nothing for the middle class. ""After one president who was out of touch ... we just can't afford more of the same."" Asked whether he prefers a Mac or PC in a Yahoo News/Politico interview earlier this year, McCain admitted: ""Neither. I am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that I can get.""  Watch more on McCain and computers » . While wife Cindy McCain has been spotted working her BlackBerry on the campaign trail, the senator -- in one instance that CNN cameras caught -- had to be handed the device by a staffer. Obama, on the other hand, frequently is seen reading e-mails on his BlackBerry. ""He is a BlackBerry fiend, has a laptop on the road and sometimes uses it to talk to his daughters ... and surfs the Web when he is in need of important information such as sports scores,"" Linda Douglass, an Obama campaign senior aide and spokeswoman,said in June.

"(CNN) -- In 1984, during the first ever VMAs, I was a 20-year-old Rutgers student. Watching the show with my roommates from our off-campus apartment, Madonna's wedding gown-clad, iconic performance of ""Like a Virgin"" made an indelible stamp on me. I saw what an unexpected, dynamic television performance could do to elevate a show and an artist, and absorbed it all as the VMAs infiltrated pop culture. I finally made it to the third VMAs, covering the show for CNN. It was a bi-coastal event that year, and I was in New York at The Palladium. Amid a torrential downpour, I stood alongside 40 or so reporters vying to get interviews with artists like Mr. Mister and Pet Shop Boys as publicists tossed swag to keep us happy. MTV's VJs like ""Downtown"" Julie Brown and Mark Goodman hosted the show, and Dire Straits took home ""Video of the Year"" for ""Money For Nothing."" The cultural impact of the VMAs and the network as a whole was undeniable: MTV was in the middle of transforming the music and entertainment industry. I wanted to be part of that energy, and by 1987, I was. VMAs have always been a mix of incredible planned performances and unexpected moments. In 2000, we surprised the audience as an army of blond Eminem clones marched into the show as the rapper sang ""The Real Slim Shady."" In 2003, we reached into our past as Madonna reprised her first VMAs performance. But this time, she was the groom and Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were rocking the white wedding dresses. In a surprise moment for all of us, they closed their performance with one of the most memorable kisses in pop culture history. Another big surprise for our team, much to the chagrin of PETA, came in the form of a meat dress in 2010 as Lady Gaga brought her unique sense of style to the stage. Sometimes the show is all about timing. For example, in 1995 we had just started an interview outside the show with Kurt Loder and Madonna while the VMAs were still on-air. Our crew caught sight of Courtney Love walking down the street by herself, headed straight toward us. She started yelling, trying to get our attention, and then began throwing her make-up one piece at a time up at Kurt Loder and Madonna. On camera, Kurt said ""Courtney is throwing stuff at us."" From inside the production truck, the producers encouraged Courtney to join the interview. Courtney stumbled up the stairs and onto the stage, interrupting Madonna, and the rest is VMA history. The VMAs have a legacy of being one of the most memorable nights in music, and our incredibly talented team does whatever it takes to bring the biggest moments and most talented artists to the stage. Booking the perfect mix of those performances can sometimes come down to the wire, though. Twelve days before the show in 2008, we still hadn't locked in our perfect closing act. At the time, I was on my way to Colorado to cover then-Sen. Barack Obama's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. I called Kanye West and as it turned out, he was already in Denver. He picked me up from the airport and we spent the ride listening to rough demos of a new song he was working on. From the second I heard it, I knew this was the big, closing performance we wanted for the show. I shared our team's vision of that year's event and some sketches of the set and we talked through what his performance could look like. A few days later we were both in L.A. in advance of the big night. Our team went to work finalizing the details, and he went to the studio and finished ""Love Lock Down,"" knowing that he'd be sharing it with the world for the first time just a few days later at the VMAs. For all the great moments, sometimes things go wrong. I'll never forget the moment in 1991 when the lights went out during one of Kurt Loder's live interviews, keeping the entire audience in the dark. Janet Jackson was in the middle of giving a heartfelt tribute to Aaliyah when the prompter went out in 2001. The same year, we left U2 hanging, literally. The band was 20 feet above the stage and ready to descend. Just as we announced their performance live on television, the band's power source went out. The band couldn't play, so all we heard was Bono joking that MTV didn't pay the electric bill. In 2004, we thought it would be a great idea to bring out the children of the presidential candidates. As the audience started to boo, we quickly realized that wasn't what the viewers wanted out of their VMAs. I've now had the letters ""MTV"" in front of my job title for 24 years and can tell you that this is a network that doesn't grow up, or old, with its audience -- and neither do the VMAs. The show is constantly evolving, and our audience expects change, innovation, risk and creativity from us. It takes the effort of hundreds of people combined with dedicated artists to plan, create and share amazing moments like when Pink! sang ""Sober"" from a trapeze high above the VMAs' stage or when Taylor Swift sang ""You Belong With Me"" as she ran up from a New York subway car to take over 6th Avenue. But, we also know that we need to create the right formula for unexpected moments, which means getting the right mix of people in the same room with the perfect music for a memorable night. This year's entire show is re-imagined for today's generation of viewers. The show will open with Lady Gaga, followed by a night of incredible performances by Beyoncé, Adele, Bruno Mars, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Pitbull and Young the Giant. The legendary Tony Bennett will present a special tribute to Amy Winehouse. And, we will be watching along with the rest of the world to see what surprise moments steal the show. From a leaky tent outside the Palladium to the highly designed, immersive time portal environment viewers will see this year, the VMAs have absolutely evolved through the years. The constant, though, are the talented artists who take over the VMA stage, capturing our audience's attention with legendary, iconic moments that will be remembered for years to come.","This year's entire show is re-imagined for today's generation of viewers .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Janet Jackson joined brothers Jermaine and Randy on Tuesday in opposing the October tribute concert for Michael Jackson because it takes place during the trial of the doctor charged in their brother's death. While Janet Jackson stopped short of criticizing the promoters or other members of her family who support the tribute, she did put to rest any rumors that she would perform in it. ""Because of the trial, the timing of this tribute to our brother would be too difficult for me,"" she said in a statement sent to CNN by her representative Tuesday. Promoters had held out hope that Janet Jackson, who currently has the most vibrant career of the musical family, would attend ""Michael Forever: The Tribute Concert,"" set for a 75,000-seat arena in Cardiff, Wales, on October 8. The biggest name on the concert bill is Beyonce, although she will not perform live. Instead, the audience will watch a video of Beyonce singing a Michael Jackson song. Ne-Yo was recently added to the show, which will also headline Christina Aguilera, Leona Lewis, Smokey Robinson, Cee Lo Green and JLS. A fan uproar forced promoters to boot KISS from the lineup because of negative comments the rock band's bassist, Gene Simmons, made about Michael Jackson in the weeks after his June 25, 2009, death. Members of the Jackson family taking the stage October 8 include several of Michael Jackson's brothers, ""the next generation of Jacksons,"" and 3T, which consists of Tito Jackson's three sons, the promoters said. The Jackson family has been publicly split over the concert since brothers Marlon, Tito and Jackie, sister La Toya and family matriarch Katherine Jackson announced their support for it in July. Brothers Jermaine and Randy quickly issued a statement opposing the show because it would happen in the middle of Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial, which starts next month. Prosecutors accuse the doctor of being responsible for the drug overdose that killed Michael Jackson. ""We want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family,"" the two brothers said in a joint statement. ""While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother, we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael's death."" Katherine Jackson told CNN she understands her children's objections to the timing of the show, but she felt it is appropriate. While she will attend most of the Murray trial in a Los Angeles courtroom, she told CNN she would travel to Wales for the tribute. Promoters promised ticket buyers that Michael Jackson's three children would also attend if they are available. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Michael Jackson's youngest sister confirms she will not attend the Wales concert .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans have a Latino problem. Only about 6% of Latino voters agree that the GOP is the party most concerned for their interests. Nearly half choose the Democrats as the party most concerned for them. Some Republicans are advancing a Latino solution: Nominate a Latino for vice president in 2012. The name most often mentioned is that of Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida. There's a lot to admire about Rubio. His personal rise from hardscrabble immigrant roots confirms Americans' highest hopes for the country. But Republicans make a big mistake if they imagine that the Rubio choice will gain them many Latino votes. Rubio is the wrong answer to the wrong question. Here's the right question: Why do Latinos tilt so heavily Democratic? Poor people in general tilt Democratic -- and Latinos are more likely than other Americans to be poor. Under the Census Bureau's newest and most sophisticated measure of poverty, some 28% of Latinos count as poor, a higher proportion than among African-Americans, 25% of whom are poor. More than one-third of Latino voters fear their home could go into foreclosure. Only 23% of Latinos describe their personal finances as ""excellent"" or ""good,"" compared to 37% of the total U.S. population. Of Latinos who are legal residents of the United States, 28% lack health insurance. In the total U.S. population, only 17% lack health insurance. Is it realistic to imagine that a Spanish-speaker on the national ticket will overcome these hard economic facts? As glibly as pundits talk about ""Hispanic voters,"" it's important to remember that a majority of American Hispanics identify themselves -- not as ""Hispanics"" -- but as Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and so on. Almost two-thirds of U.S. Hispanics are Mexican-Americans. As Rubin Navarette recently pointed out on CNN Opinion, the values and interests of Mexican-Americans do not align naturally with those of Cuban-Americans like Marco Rubio. ""Thanks to the Cuban Adjustment Act, which was enacted in 1966 -- or four years after Rubio's grandfather came to the United States -- Cuban refugees who flee the Island and reach the U.S. shoreline have a clear path to legal residency and eventual citizenship. Mexican immigrants aren't so fortunate. So when Cuban-Americans do what Rubio has done since arriving in the Senate 16 months ago and take a hard line against illegal immigration, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have been known to cringe. After all, that's easy for them to say."" Under these circumstances, Republicans should be cautious about assuming that they can sway Latino votes with the symbolic politics of a Rubio nomination. What would work better are policy changes and message changes to win back the 9 points worth of Latino votes that Republicans lost between the elections of 2004 and 2008. Republicans tend to assume that immigration is the issue that most moves Latino voters. If that assumption was ever true, it is not true now. Latinos were hit hard by the economic crisis that began in 2007. They were promised ""hope"" by Barack Obama in 2008. Those hopes have been largely disappointed. But what are Republicans offering instead? And to the extent that symbolic politics can sway votes, Republicans should be looking to groups more receptive to the core Republican message than Mexican-Americans are likely to be. The Asian-American population is also growing fast, and many Asian groups -- Vietnamese-Americans and Indian-Americans to name only two -- are gaining their success in small business. They are natural targets for Republican recruitment. In Britain, Australia, and Canada, conservative parties have done well with these immigrant groups. In fact, in the federal election of 2010, Canada's Conservatives won a plurality of the vote among voters who spoke Chinese at home. For these voters, inclusion does matter. Symbols of inclusion can work. As symbols go, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is a doozy: a brilliant policy mind with an inspirational life story who has run an effective government in corruption-tainted Louisiana. He can talk data with Romney and credibly sit at the kitchen tables of the struggling middle class. Which leads to this thought: Bobby Jindal for vice president! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Some advocate GOP should run a Latino candidate for VP .

"(CNN) -- For those craving to look like the young rock star fashionistas lighting up the Billboard charts, copycat fashion blogs may be the cure. As Nicki Minaj sassily questions people trying to steal her style in her popular song, ""Saxon,"" ""Did you copy that, copycat?"" Female musicians of all genres have long been regarded as fashion icons, and today's music scene is no exception. Lady Gaga, Minaj, Katy Perry and even wild child Ke$ha are inspiring trends tending toward the outrageous -- and people are looking for some outrageous in their life, it seems. ""What I love about Nicki Minaj's style is that she is not afraid to push the envelope,"" says Niki Schwan, one of Minaj's stylists. ""She is less concerned with what people 'will think' and more focused on how she is feeling at that moment -- how she wants to be seen for that event, rather than dressing for what she thinks people will want to see her in. I love that she has almost encouraged and used hair and makeup as an accessory."" Want to wear a kaleidoscope of color like Minaj? Start with the hair. According to Schwan, wig sales, especially the bright color variety, are booming. ""Nicki never takes herself too seriously, which makes this outlandish fun style really approachable,"" Schwan says. ""She incorporates tons of humor into her style, and is fearless in her approach, which I think people really admire and appreciate as an artist, a woman and a rising icon."" The fashions of rising icons aren't far from becoming your own street style reality.  While copycat fashion isn't a new trend, the clothing inspiring these trends can feel unattainable or impossible. Fortunately, ""impossible"" doesn't exist for blogger Anna Nguyen. An interior design graduate of the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, Nguyen, 27, is the founder of Style with Anna. ""I love taking a crazy Lady Gaga outfit and translating it to daywear,"" Nguyen says. ""It looks great on stage, but most of us aren't on stage. This way, you can channel your own inner Lady Gaga."" Based out of Irvine, California, Nguyen is no stranger to celebrity fashion. She began her blog two years ago to prove a point: The interior designer also knew as much about dressing people as she did staging a living room. Because of her own obsession with Lady Gaga's fashion, Nguyen says she began posting ""How to Dress Like"" female musicians and celebrities. Then came a flood of e-mails asking ""Can you do a Ke$ha post, too?"" and other similar requests. As someone who loves to dress other people, Nguyen jumped on the challenge of copycat fashion. Nguyen has the mind of a designer. In a matter of minutes, she can analyze an outrageous outfit and translate it into something appropriate for the workplace, or even a design for a room. She builds collages of different components she finds, and soon, Nguyen has composed an accessible version of a rock star ensemble. For example, if Lady Gaga is wearing an outfit covered with feathers, Nguyen recommends finding a cool feather necklace to add some funk to your wardrobe. If an outfit completely mystifies you, just look at the fabric or material and base your search on that, Nguyen says. So what does Nguyen see as the drive behind all the requests she receives for her popular ""How to Dress Like"" posts? ""It's fun to change up everyday style,"" Nguyen says. ""It takes the focus off everything else going on in the world. We can use what we already have in our closets and funk it up, even just with accessories, to express ourselves. People want something to be inspired by."" If you're cautious about wearing Gaga or Ke$ha swag in the workplace but still want to emulate a style icon, try for something that fits your tastes, Nguyen says. ""For the average fashion-inclined person, Beyonce has a sophisticated style that is calm enough to translate to the normal working world,"" Nguyen says. Although a Lady Gaga fan, Nguyen doesn't neglect other musicians in the name of being one of Lady G's ""little monsters,"" the nickname given to Gaga fans. Under the Styles and Trends section, there are ""How to Dress Like"" collages for a multitude of artists and celebrities, and even a section for men under Fashion for Guys. However, some female rockers and songsters already wear styles that are easily attainable. Even if ""teenage dream"" queen Katy Perry attempts to be elusive, you can simply Steal Her Style with Linda Paiste's blog. A fan of the band Paramore, Paiste wanted to create a website to show her appreciation, but not just another fan site. Paiste was also a fan of lead singer Hayley Williams' style -- it was fun, edgy and accessible. She didn't think her first site, Hayley Fashion, would gain popularity so quickly. Today, nearly 14,000 people a day stop by Hayley Fashion, with 7,000 glancing at Steal Her Style as well. The latter has more than 60,000 unique visitors a month. ""I never expected it to be a big thing,"" Paiste says. ""Then, I started receiving e-mails from other people saying, 'I wish there was a site like this for Katy Perry,' and I thought, 'I could do that.' So, I made a site for everyone, something that is all-encompassing."" A community of contributors built up around the newly formed Steal Her Style, which focuses only on female musicians, as well as Hayley Fashion. People e-mailed her regularly with ""found"" outfits. The three most popular artists on Steal Her Style are Katy Perry, Cassadee Pope of Hey Monday and Sierra Kusterbeck of VersaEmerge, but there are numerous posts about other musicians as well. While some visitors to the site are stopping by for ideas about their own style, others are looking for where to buy exact items worn by their favorite musicians. ""It depends on the person,"" Paiste says. ""Katy Perry has a stylist, so all of her outfits are really well put together. It's just looking at what she wears to help pull together your own look. With bands, you can buy what they're wearing at stores like Hot Topic. They are things that anyone can buy and anyone can wear."" Posts about outfits seen on stage translate easily to affordable jewelry, T-shirts, jeans and jackets, usually with links to where they can be found. By keeping up with popular artists, Paiste also has an eye on evolving trends. According to Paiste, the ""hipster"" look is ever present, from Minnetonka fringe boots and moccasins to SpiritHoods, animal-inspired hats. Without the current music scene, Paiste questions if something like SpiritHoods would have caught on. Copycat style is a sense of fashion all its own and to attain it, some people take things a step further: enlisting the help of a personal shopper. When clients approach Bloomingdales' personal shoppers to help build up their wardrobes, they already come with inspiration. ""Clients will comment about a trend or style worn by a celebrity,"" Marian Goodman, vice president of personal shopping, says. ""The studded shoes and platforms from Burberry and Sam Edelman have been popular."" ""Clients are inspired by celebrity style and they will then 'adapt' those trends to fit into their own lifestyle. Copycat fashion is its own trend, especially when it comes to accessories."" Just like the blogs that help you adopt your own copycat look, artists and celebrities wear a myriad array of styles that provide a springboard for personal inspiration. ""With artists like Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga and Rihanna in the forefront of the entertainment spotlight, there is a wide-open door to express yourself through your style and fashion,"" Schwan says. ""It is accepted and encouraged, and ultimately inspired by these types of icons, who are each different from one another, yet each the same in that they are not afraid to express their style and brand through what they wear.""","Musicians like Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, Ke$ha influence fashion trends .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Three U.S. drone strikes killed five suspected al Qaeda militants after hitting two vehicles in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, two local security officials told CNN Thursday. The first strike killed three militants in al-Saeed district, the officials said. The other two strikes were in nearby Aal Mahdi district -- with the first one missing its target, and the second killing the other two militants, they added. Read more: A dangerous new world of drones . ""The drone strikes killed five al Qaeda fighters but other militants are still on the run and hiding in the area,"" one of the officials told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. ""These parts of Shabwa have been strongholds for militants for more than a year, in large part because of the weak government security presence."" Residents in al-Saeed said the drones have been flying in the district for nearly a week. U.S. drones have been targeting hideouts and operatives of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) for the last two years in Yemen. FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress in May that al Qaeda and its affiliates, ""especially al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, currently represent the top counterterrorism threat to the nation."" The group was behind the so-called underwear bomb attempt on a U.S.-bound international flight on Christmas Day 2009 and an effort to smuggle bombs in printer cartridges onto U.S.-bound cargo planes in 2010.

The Yemeni army killed hundreds of militants and arrested many others in the provinces of Abyan and Shabwa this year, after the terror group took advantage of a political stalemate in the country in 2011 to seize control of numerous towns in the south. The drone strikes have sparked controversy in Yemen and Pakistan, where they're also used to target militants, after civilians have been killed accidentally in some of the explosions.

Yemen's parliament summoned Interior Minister Abdul-Kader Qahtan last month, demanding an explanation for a U.S. drone attack that killed 13 people, including two women, in the town of Rada in al-Baidha province. Members of parliament demanded an immediate investigation into U.S. drone strikes that they said targeted ""innocent people"" under the pretext of fighting al Qaeda. Lawmaker Nabil Al-Basha strongly criticized the attitude of the Yemeni government toward the drone strikes, noting that extra-judicial killing is prohibited in all laws and legislations.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York Gov. David Paterson has chosen Democratic Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand to succeed Hillary Clinton as U.S. Senator from New York, multiple Democratic sources told CNN Friday. Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand has been picked to succeed Hillary Clinton as U.S. Senator from New York, sources say. Gillibrand, 42, represents New York's traditionally Republican 20th district. She is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of congressional Democrats who hold more conservative views than their liberal Democratic counterparts. She is an outspoken advocate for gun rights, and she supports an extension of the Bush tax cuts. She has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association. She also has a 100 percent rating from the American Civil Liberties Union. Paterson must appoint a replacement for Clinton, who was sworn in as President Obama's secretary of state Wednesday. A special election will be held in 2010 for the remaining two years of Clinton's term. Paterson will formally announce his decision at a noon press conference in Albany, New York. The final decision was made around 2 a.m. It came down to Gillibrand and Randi Weingarten, the dark horse candidate who is president of the United Federation of Teachers. Among the considerations Paterson used in selecting Gillibrand were that she is a woman and she is from upstate New York, sources said. Both those factors could help Paterson when he runs for election as governor next year. A Paterson spokeswoman, Erin Duggan, would not comment on the reports. ""The governor is making his announcement at noon today, and that is the only comment we are making at this time,"" Duggan said early Friday. Caroline Kennedy, seen as a favorite to fill the vacant seat, withdrew her name from consideration Wednesday, citing personal reasons. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Steve Israel also have been mentioned as possible appointees.  Watch who is in contention for the Senate seat » . Gillibrand was elected to the House of Representatives in 2006, unseating Republican John Sweeney. In the 1990s, she worked as a lawyer for the Department of Housing and Urban Development during Cuomo's tenure as housing secretary in the Clinton administration. She was one of dozens of Democrats who joined House Republicans in voting against the Bush administration's $700 billion bailout of the financial industry in October, arguing the plan lacked proper oversight. Kennedy, 51, cited personal reasons for her decision not to continue pursuing the Senate seat, but Paterson had no intention of appointing her, a source close to the governor told CNN. Paterson did not think Kennedy was ""ready for prime time,"" citing her efforts, at times awkward, to try to win the appointment, the source told CNN. ""She clearly has no policy experience and couldn't handle the pressure,"" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- The Gomez family may be one of the few in the country who won't be too disappointed if it rains over the Fourth of July weekend. Joining family or friends at a vacation rental home is a great way to spend time together and save money. ""We just play indoor games in the cabins,"" says Michele Abril. For the last 20 years, she explains, her extended family -- 30 strong and including four generations -- has gathered at rustic cabins on Lake Sebago in New York for some old-fashioned fun. They crowd into four cabins (showers are a walk away), tote everything they need (even toilet paper) and divide all the chores. And they wouldn't have it any other way. Maybe it's the economy. Maybe it's the need to reconnect with friends and family. At beach houses and on sailboats, city condos and mountain cabins, families and friends are joining forces on vacation. According to a new survey from TripAdvisor of people with children, nearly a third report they will vacation with another family this year to save money -- a significant jump from 2008. ""We get calls daily from family and friends who want to get together in our cabins,"" says Stephanie Seacord from Point Lookout Resort in Maine where cabins that sleep nine or more start at $195. Cabins can be rented for even less in Colorado at the YMCA of the Rockies where my family has also shared quarters -- and cooking chores -- with relatives at a family reunion. More visitors to Hawaii are opting to split condos rather than get individual hotel rooms, adds Lisa Cripe of Aston Hotels & Resorts, which has hotels, condo resorts and villas all across Hawaii. Even Disney is getting into the act, with new Disney Deluxe Villa Resorts Vacation Club options that you can turn into your home away from home. In Florida, Kidani Village at Animal Kingdom Lodge and Treehouse Villas at Saratoga Springs Resort are brand-new with a third villa resort slated to open later this summer. Another resort is expected to open at Disneyland in California in the fall. You do the math. Whether you are at rustic cabins or a luxurious beachfront rental house, you'll spend less when splitting costs with another family. Especially this year with rental owners -- 66 percent -- offering special deals to encourage business, according to a survey from www.homeaway.com, the leading online vacation rental Web site. They're throwing in everything from a free night to free cleaning service, discounts, even tickets to a local attraction or food. No wonder families are joining forces on everything from city apartment rentals (lots cheaper than a hotel!) to road trips to tours of Alaska. Elaine Masters and her son joined forced with another family and, says Elaine, ""stayed in several suites where we could cook our meals, had cereal breakfasts and packed picnic lunches when we could."" And they spent less than they would have on a cruise. ""We saw everything we wanted (except Denali stayed hidden behind clouds)."" When the kids were small, we met up every summer in Minnesota at Ludlow's Island Resort where we ate the fish we caught for dinner and the kids would chase frogs and ride in the special car that goes in the water. We've shared Cape Cod and Caribbean houses, and every winter, Colorado ski condos with friends and family. Our next trip may be our farthest afield shared trip -- a sailboat in Tahiti with another family and two of my daughter Mel's oldest camp friends -- the girls' high school graduation present. But these trips are about much more than saving money. ""I love that our group can get together once a year or every other year and feel like we haven't missed a beat,"" says Carin Kromm, a geologist from Kernersville, North Carolina. Kromm gathers with her college friends and their children at a vacation home owned by one of the group. Single mom Kelly Ladyga adds that it was much more relaxing to join forces with another single mom than to take her young daughter solo. Besides sharing the cost of rent at a beach house in North Carolina, groceries and rental car, she was able to get a much-needed break -- far more relaxing than the solo trip she took to Hawaii. ""Plus it was nice to sit with someone on the deck at night, drink wine and laugh about the day's adventures."" ""It helps with your sanity for sure, kids seem to play better when they have other kids to play with -- the more children, the busier they keep each other,"" says Michelle Revuelta, the Miami mom of two young daughters who has rented condos in Orlando and elsewhere with other families. ""You truly feel you are on vacation,"" she says. And that isn't easy to accomplish with young kids in tow. There are some rules to be sure. Never discipline anyone else's child, for one. That's a parent's prerogative. Sophia Bilinsky, who rents vacation homes as a business (www.seaestahomes.com) and who hosts her college group of seven families, says the hardest part is choosing the date. Make sure there are enough bedrooms, bathrooms and a common space where the kids can hang out in addition to the adults. ""A swimming pool is mandatory,"" she adds. ""Just remember that where you are isn't as important as the place you rent."" Rates for some three-bedroom vacation homes start at just $99 per night, but sleep up to eight travelers, not just one or two, notes Alex Risser, president of the Vacation Rental Managers Association. Be clear how you are dividing the costs. In her case, each family takes a day of the week and gets groceries, cooks dinner and cleans up. Other families simply split costs. Some divide the rent based on the number of bedrooms they are using or split the cost straight down the middle. However you do it, suggests Carin Kromm, keep it simple. ""There is no need to schedule a lot of activities for the children."" The beauty of a vacation like this is allowing the kids to entertain themselves. A pool or the beach may be all they need. And once the kids are in bed, says Blinsky, the grown-ups can enjoy some ""adult"" time. They're not stuck staring at the wall in a hotel room watching the children sleep. There's no corralling kids in restaurants, no getting dressed to feed the hungry preschoolers in an (overpriced) hotel dining room, no worrying about a tired toddler melting down in a hotel lobby. There's no worrying about the rain either. ""With a 30-person family, we make up our own entertainment,"" says Michelle Abril. That's the best kind.

"(CNN) -- Mali is a ticking time bomb. Once hailed as a model of democracy in Africa, a coup and an uprising of Islamist militants in the north threatens to create an arc of instability for the continent. The militants have destroyed ancient shrines, once a major draw for Islamic scholars from around the world. They have banned music. And reports of human rights abuses grow daily, including the public stoning death of a couple accused of having an affair. International leaders, concerned that al Qaeda will capitalize on the chaos and set up a haven there, are considering sending troops to Mali soon to reclaim a large portion of the north from extremists. What's the story behind the instability? Mali gained independence from France in 1960. The landlocked West African nation went through growing pains after independence, including droughts, rebellions and years of military dictatorship. It held its first democratic elections in 1992, and had a strong democracy for the most part. That was until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, undermining the nation's growing economy and relative social stability. What led to the coup? A group of outraged soldiers accused the government of not providing adequate equipment to battle ethnic Tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert in the north. On March 22, a riot erupted at a military camp a few miles from the presidential palace in the capital of Bamako. Disgruntled soldiers marched to the palace. A few hours later, a soldier appeared on state television and said the military was in control of the nation. The president was nowhere to be found. The Tuareg rebels took advantage of the power vacuum and seized some parts of the north. They have always wanted independence, and have staged several rebellions since the 1960s. After Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was killed and Libya plunged into chaos, his weapons became available. The Tuareg -- many of whom fought for him -- seized them and took up arms against the Malian government. How did the north end up in the hands of Islamist militants? After Tuareg rebels seized it, a power struggle erupted with local Islamist radicals. The Islamist extremists toppled the tribe and seized control of two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Various factions of al Qaeda-linked militants are reportedly in the area, including Ansar Dine. The international community is also worried that al Qaeda's north African wing is expanding into Mali. U.S. officials have said that the wing, the al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, is linked to the deadly Benghazi attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. Why does the instability concern the international community? The international community is concerned that al Qaeda will capitalize on the chaos to set up a haven there. The area is remote and hard to access, making it an appealing location for the militants. Tuareg rebels have retreated from the well-armed militants, but have vowed to fight back against the Islamists. The Tuareg want their own country in the north, which they call Azawad. And as the world seeks a solution, the Islamist militants are busy applying their strict interpretation of sharia law. What are some of the human rights concerns in Mali? Islamists controlling most of the north have vowed to impose a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. ""We don't have to answer to anyone over the application of sharia,"" Islamist commissioner Aliou Toure said in August. Locals are not receptive to the extreme interpretations; they practice a much more relaxed form of Islam. Some have taken to the streets in protest. As part of their new laws, the radical groups banned music, a major setback for a country known for ""Festival au Desert,"" where acts like Robert Plant and Bono have performed. They've also said no to smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. At least four times this year, the militants have destroyed Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines, claiming the relics are idolatrous. The picturesque city was once an important destination for Islamic scholars for its ancient and prominent burial sites. Rights groups have expressed concerns of mounting human rights abuses. The militants are compiling a list of mothers who've had children out of wedlock, raising fears of cruel punishments, according to the United Nations. They have also condemned relationships outside marriage, and publicly stoned a couple to death in July for reportedly having an affair. Terrified residents watched quietly. Public executions, amputations, floggings and other inhuman punishments are becoming common, the United Nations says. Is military intervention next? West African states and international leaders say a rapid military intervention is essential to solving the security crisis. During a meeting in the Malian capital on October 19, the U.N. deputy secretary-general said the world body is ready to bring military planners and security advisers. The meeting was a followup to an October 12 resolution by the U.N. Security Council that gave regional leaders 45 days to provide detailed plans for an international military intervention . ""This is a threat we cannot afford to take lightly, and the danger extends far beyond Africa,"" said Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chief of the African Union Commission. ""The sooner we deal with it, the better."" What is the public opinion on military intervention? Opinions are varied. Malians for and against military intervention have protested in recent days, highlighting a divide in the citizens' outlook. While some analysts agree quashing the rebels is vital, they are urging caution. ""The human cost could be high -- fighting urban warfare in cities against an enemy who does not wear a uniform and can easily blend into the civilian population,"" said Ayo Johnson of ViewPoint Africa, which sells content on the continent to the media. ""There will be many casualties and civilian deaths caught in the crossfire."" Johnson said the influx of refugees streaming to bordering nations will be a burden on neighboring host countries already dealing with lack of adequate services such as health care, schools and water. In addition to the fleeing the conflict, throngs of Malians are living in neighboring nations to avoid a food shortage affecting the Sahel region. More than 16 million people in the Sahel region are affected by the food shortages and malnutrition, according to the United Nations.","Mali, once hailed as a model of democracy, is a time bomb .

"(Mashable) -- Magnets: How do they work? Differently on the new iPad than on the iPad 2, it has emerged -- and that's bad news for anyone with an old or third-party smart cover. A number of users who bought new iPads over the weekend (this reporter included) were dismayed to discover that the smart covers they'd bought for the iPad 2 didn't work on the new model. Smart covers, which attach to the iPad's built-in magnets, are supposed to turn the tablet on automatically when you flip them open. But as dozens of iPad users in this Apple forum concurred, that was no longer the case with many smart covers on the new iPad. That seemed odd, as the new iPad is physically no different from the iPad 2 -- on the surface, at least. But it turns out Apple has been messing with the polarity of its magnets under the hood. Photographer Mark Booth uncovered this when he did some experiments with magnets, iPads and a couple of smart covers. You can see the results in a video on Booth's blog. ""The iPad 2â€²s sleep/wake sensor wasn't polarity specific,"" Booth explains. And that apparently led to an issue for iPad 2 users who flipped their smart covers around so that they sat flush with the back of the tablet -- an everyday act that could cause the iPad 2 to switch off unintentionally. So it seems the new iPad's sleep/wake sensor does require a specific polarity. But in fixing one issue, Apple appears to have caused another for users who want to use their old smart covers with their new tablets. (We've asked Apple to comment, and will update you if we hear back.) Booth theorizes that Apple quietly made the polarity change in their smart covers at some point in 2011, since newer Apple-made smart covers do seem to work with the new iPad. If you got yours for the holidays, there's a good chance you won't see a problem. If your smart cover hails from early 2011, try taking it back to the Apple store; Booth says he's hearing from users that the store will exchange old smart covers for new ones. Owners of third-party smart covers, however -- such as the beautiful wood covers from Miniot -- appear to be out of luck. And it may not simply be a case of having to turn the new tablet on manually. In tests using my Miniot as a stand -- the other purpose of the smart cover -- the new iPad's screen was plagued by fuzzy electronic lines and flashing artifacts. Do you own a smart cover and a new iPad? Have you noticed this issue? Let us know in the comments. See the original article on Mashable . © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Barack Obama, who shot from obscurity to fame based on a single speech and then captured the White House in a campaign marked by soaring rhetoric, delivered a restrained, sober inaugural address Tuesday. American patriot Thomas Paine seems to have informed some of the spirit of President Obama's inaugural speech. Gone was the mantra-like ""Yes we can"" chanted by supporters, which Obama invoked as a refrain right through his victory speech on Election Night. Largely absent, too, were citations from the two historical figures on whose shoulders Obama stood Tuesday -- Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr., both of whom he quoted on the night of his triumph in November. He took his oath of office on Lincoln's 1861 inaugural Bible, closing a circle of symbolism that began when he declared his candidacy for president two years ago on the same spot in Illinois where Lincoln launched his own first campaign. But other than mentioning ""the lash of the whip,"" an echo of Lincoln's towering second inaugural address, and ""gathering clouds and raging storms,"" Obama did not seem to quote the 16th president. And, perhaps thinking that the simple fact of an African-American being sworn in as president was sufficiently drenched with significance, he made only the most glancing reference to King. ""We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers,"" Obama said, a contemporary variation on King's hope that ""Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics"" would one day join hands and sing.  Watch President Obama's full speech » . In fact, if the speech could be said to have an animating spirit, it was that of Thomas Paine, the great 18th-century pamphleteer who played a key role in the American and French revolutions. Obama referred to ""the rights of man,"" the title of a book Paine wrote in praise of the French Revolution. And his speech ended with a long quote from Paine that George Washington ordered read to his troops when the revolt looked bleak for the Colonies: ""Let it be told to the future world ... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet (it.)"" The passage comes from Paine's critical 1776 essay ""The Crisis,"" which famously begins: ""These are the times that try men's souls."" Indeed, Obama used the word ""crisis"" four times in his speech -- one more time than he used the word perhaps most closely identified with him: Hope. ""That we are in the midst of a crisis is now well-understood,"" Obama said, in a speech that warned Americans to prepare for a long, hard -- but certain -- slog toward better days. He drew on the touchstones of American civic life, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, with phrases such as ""we the people,"" ""common defense"" and ""all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness."" He nodded towards John F. Kennedy with a reference to ""rising tides of prosperity"" and Franklin Roosevelt in saying Americans had chosen ""hope over fear."" And he seemed to carry on a bit of an argument with Ronald Reagan, listing key battlefields in American history (""Concord and Gettysburg, Normandy and Khe Sahn""), as Reagan did in his first inaugural, but rejecting the most famous phrase from that speech.  Watch CNN's Fareed Zakaria discuss writing a memorable speech » . ""Government is not the solution to the problem, government is the problem,"" Reagan declared in 1981. No, Obama seemed to respond 28 years later, ""The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works. ... Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end ... because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government."" He also borrowed a notion associated with Reagan, but running through American history right back to the Puritans, who in turn took it from the book of Isaiah: that American ideals ""still light the world."" And his conclusion bookended the two great sources of quotes in the English language, Shakespeare and the Bible. America, he said, may be experiencing ""this winter of our hardship"" -- riffing on Richard III's ""winter of our discontent"" -- but will prove ""when we were tested"" -- as Abraham was by God -- ""we refused to let this journey end ... with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- So, America has decided. President Barack Obama has been returned for another term. Now it is China's turn. In the space of one week the world's two great powers decide their immediate futures. More: China's secretive process . It's not all they have in common. America and China are joined at the wallet. China makes mass cost-effective products, United States consumers buy them. The U.S. is China's single biggest trade partner, China is the biggest holder of American debt. Yet so much attention is given to what divides the two powers. In the U.S presidential election both candidates tried to ""out-tough"" each other on China. There were the now mandatory claims of China stealing American jobs, not playing fair, manipulating its currency to gain an export advantage. Beijing has cautioned U.S. politicians to treat China with respect. It talks about win-win, the need for cooperation. More: 3 challenges for China's next leaders . President Obama made it clear during the campaign that China can be either a partner or an adversary. He's backing his words with firepower. The U.S. has pivoted to Asia away from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is consolidating key alliances in Southeast Asia, carrying out military exercises with Japan and South Korea. American troops are now in place on Australian soil. Some analysts interpret this as an attempt to contain China's rise. China is rattling other nations in Asia with its military build-up and tense territorial disputes. Violent protests have erupted across China as people denounce the likes of Japan and the Philippines. More: Opinion: West should prepare for confusing new Chinese leader . But away from the heat of politics and trade, ordinary people are building bridges.

Jonathon Levine left his home in New York when he found himself unemployed. Armed with a masters degree he found a job teaching U.S. Studies at Beijing's Tsinghua University. He says ""China bashing"" isn't the answer, the world, he says, needs to get over its fear. ""It's not like going to the moon like it might have been 100 years ago because communication links us much closer together,"" Levine said. China is not the moon, but it is world's away from the U.S. in so many ways. Where America prides itself on its democracy, the Chinese Communist Party keeps a tight grip on power. The U.S is the home of laissez-faire capitalism, China remains a command economy.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- The Union flag was raised over Belfast City Hall on Wednesday morning for the first time since a vote last month to stop flying it year-round prompted violent protests in Northern Ireland. The flag was flying because of the birthday of Prince William's wife, Catherine -- one of the designated days when the flag will still be flown. It was taken down again as planned Wednesday evening, a night after pro-flag protesters in East Belfast threw fireworks and petrol bombs at police. Watch: Northern Ireland protests explained . However, the disorder was sporadic and on a smaller scale than on previous nights. Sixty-six officers have been injured and more than 100 people arrested since the protests started five weeks ago, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said Wednesday. The leaders of the two main unionist political parties said on Tuesday they would hold a ""Unionist Forum"" on Thursday at Stormont to address underlying grievances peacefully. The forum seeks ""to engage with the entire unionist community and to address issues of concern. It will seek to channel unionist efforts through political means,"" said First Minister Peter Robinson, of the Democratic Unionist Party, and Mike Nesbitt, of the Ulster Unionist Party. It was not clear whether representatives for the protesters would attend. Authorities have accused loyalist extremists of exploiting the December 3 decision by Belfast officials to end the century-old tradition of flying the Union Jack over City Hall year-round. A number of demonstrations are planned across Northern Ireland on Friday. Read more: Political forum aims to stem N.Ireland violence . The British flag has long been a flashpoint between British loyalists and Irish nationalists, who want Northern Ireland to join the Irish republic. The Belfast City Council vote followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police injured. The majority of Ireland gained independence in 1921 following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as ""the Troubles."" The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, also known as the Belfast Agreement, effectively ended the conflict, distrust remains between Catholics and Protestants. Under the terms of the accord, groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government.","Police say 66 officers injured, 100 arrests made since protests started five weeks ago .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China was a whipping boy on the U.S. campaign trail. So now that incumbent Barack Obama is savoring victory, Beijing will be breathing a sigh of relief. There will be relief that a bitter campaign -- where both candidates talked tough on China -- is over. China will be especially glad it doesn't have Mitt Romney to deal with. ""China is quite happy that Obama won the election because Obama is a known entity,"" says political columnist Frank Ching. ""It's better to have the devil you know, than the one you don't."" But the whipping boy is also lashing back, taking aim at America's perceived political flaws and diminished role on the world stage. The state-run People's Daily portends dark days ahead for the U.S. president: ""As soon as Obama gets re-elected, he will immediately be confronted with the strangling of Washington's political machine."" Hu Xijin, editor of the pro-Beijing Global Times, weighs in on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like micro-blogging service, with this double-edged post: ""Obama has been re-elected as the American president. Sincere best wishes to him and the U.S... The rapid rise of China and the decline of the U.S. imply a massive risk in international politics."" And on China's Netease.com, one Netizen from Jiangsu province writes: ""I really like you, Obama! Congratulations! Though I hope that you'll mind your own business in your next four years, and stop interfering in the political affairs of other countries."" Non-interference is a non-starter given how interconnected the two countries are. China is one of America's largest trading partners. The nations' two economies are deeply interconnected with Beijing holding more than $1 trillion in U.S. debt and U.S. exports to China on the rise. While on the campaign trail, Obama has taken action against China -- slapping tariffs on China-made tires and solar panels as well as filing a new case with the World Trade Organization against China for unfair auto subsidies. But such action was taken not to merely score political points. It's a sign of more ""tough on China"" policy-making to come. Special: Full China leadership change coverage . David Zweig, an associate dean at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, says: ""Obama is facing a strategic situation which is the rise of China, and that is going to force him to have to respond...That is the strategic reality. China is rising and this will be a challenging relationship."" And it gets even more complicated. China is undergoing a leadership transition of its own with the start of the 18th Party Congress on Thursday in Beijing, designed to bring forth a new generation of leaders who will run China for the next 10 years. The world is waiting to see exactly who will rise to the Politburo Standing Committee, the elite group with the highest concentration of decision-making power. It's a November of change for China and the U.S., and even the ardently pro-Beijing editor of the Global Times wants to see a win-win for both. ""I hope that Obama will demonstrate great talent on China issues, encourage China to rise peacefully, and will release the world from the tragedy of great power politics forever,"" says Hu. Hope. With Obama's re-election, it's being embraced in China as well. CNN's Yuli Yang contributed to this report.","China has been a key topic during the U.S. election campaign .

"(CNN) -- Australian disc jockey Michael Christian told an interviewer that ""Prank calls are made every day on every radio station in every country around the world, and they have been for a long time, and no one could have imagined this to happen."" He was talking about the suicide of Jacintha Saldanha, a nurse who was on the receiving end of a prank call he made with co-host Mel Greig. They pretended to be Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth II phoning King Edward VII Hospital in London to find out the condition of the Duchess of Cambridge, who had been admitted for a severe case of morning sickness. Saldanha apparently felt so humiliated by falling for the ruse that she took her own life. I'm not an expert in mental health, so I'm not in a position to evaluate the extent to which the radio station's gag played a role in Saldanha's death. But I do have proof that it's possible for disc jockeys to play a practical joke on someone without anyone getting hurt. In 1993, morning radio personality Brent Douglas from KMOD-FM in Tulsa, Oklahoma, began posing as a rustic, angry fellow named Roy D. Mercer. He'd call unsuspecting folks in the community and tell them they'd committed some injustice against him, such as selling him a burrito that created stomach trouble at the christening of his grandniece. Mercer's outrageous demands for retribution quickly led to threats of an ""a**-whuppin',"" but just as the person on the receiving end was about to blow his stack, Douglas and co-host Phil Stone let the patsy in on the joke. Everyone has a good laugh, and no one was worse for wear. The Mercer character has developed a huge following across the country through CDs sold at truck stops, but I'd never heard of him until a music subscription service recommended him after I listened to an album by Larry the Cable Guy. From the moment I heard the first track, I was hooked, and I ended up playing every album more times than I can count -- as my beleaguered wife will attest. For samples of Mercer calls, click on menu's ""speed dial"" Whatever the supposed injustice that Mercer encountered, the result was always the same: a request for an outrageous sum of money to right the wrong, followed by the threat of violence, and ending with the recipient of the call being informed that the whole thing was a ruse set up by a friend. Weinstein's interview with Douglas and Stone . The Australian DJs' mistake was not the making of the call, which done artfully might indeed have been funny. Rather, they erred in not letting the person who took the call know that the whole thing was a joke. Whether this would have prevented Saldhana's suicide is hard to say. Perhaps she was so troubled that the slightest upset would have brought about her tragic choice. But this sad story should be a wake-up call for radio hosts around the world to follow the Roy D. Mercer model of prank calls: Let the person in on the joke before things spiral out of control. The ethical principle at the heart of this policy is simple: Do No Harm. We associate this principle with health care professionals, and rightly so: We'd like our physicians to make us better. But at the very least, we can expect that they won't make us worse. The Do No Harm principle is a bedrock of ethics courses every would-be medical, nursing, dental and pharmacy student must take to graduate. Yet Do No Harm applies not just to health care providers but to radio personalities, their producers and everyone else. What would the world be like if we couldn't be confident that people we encounter will not harm us, and that they will be punished if they willfully do so? No one would want to leave home, and as we learn from CNN daily, too many folks around the world live in such fear. Of course, terrorists, dictators and other despots violate the Do No Harm principle regularly, which is why it makes sense to speak of just wars. Even one of our most notable advocates of peace, Sir Paul McCartney, responded to 9/11 with a song whose chorus goes, ""We will fight for the right to live in freedom."" Still, the fact that some or even a lot of people intentionally cause harm every day does not mean that Do No Harm is an unrealistic guideline for living responsibly. Even if many people do X, if doesn't follow that X is right or good. Disc jockey Michael Christian may be correct that prank calls are part and parcel of radio programs around the world. But the public still has a right to demand that media professionals avoid doing or saying things that would reasonably cause others to feel humiliated or degraded. I call upon radio hosts, producers and station owners in every country to formally adopt the Do No Harm principle in their employment policies, so that incidents like the royal hoax can be avoided. On a sad note, Phil Stone, who helped to write much of Roy D. Mercer's material, died a few weeks ago. His death was not related to the pranks he pulled, but it did galvanize people across the country to mourn the loss of a good-natured fellow whose practical jokes were both funny and respectful. His final CD, ""Red, White and Bruised,"" will be released next month by Capitol Nashville/EMI.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Two blasts shook a Nigerian government office Monday shortly after a rebel group sent out a message that it had planted bombs around the building, according to officials. No officials were hurt in the explosions in Warri in southern Nigeria, said Delta state government spokesman Linus Chima. It was not immediately known whether anyone else was wounded. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) claimed responsibility. It was the group's first claim for an attack since calling off a cease-fire with the government in January. The bombs were mounted in vehicles located about 200 meters (656 feet) away from the building, Delta state Commissioner for Information Oma Djebah said in a statement. Officials were meeting in the building to discuss steps forward with amnesty given to militants who agreed to lay down their arms. Present at the meeting were three state governors, including Delta state governor Emmanuel Uduaghan, and the minister for the Niger Delta. ""It was a plan to scuttle the peace talks,"" Chima said about the bombings. Participants in the conference were evacuated and the event ""has been put off,"" Djebah said without detailing when or if it would reconvene. ""The people of the Niger Delta will not be intimidated or deterred by the act of a few opposed to a peaceful and non-violent approach to resolving the historic grievances of the region,"" Djebah said. ""We assure all that we will not be deterred in our determination to fast-track our development for our people."" In an e-mailed message, MEND had warned of three planted bombs, with the first to be detonated remotely at 11:30 a.m. (6:30 a.m. ET). Authorities have yet to comment on a possible third bomb. MEND, which has been battling the government for fairer distribution of the country's oil wealth, threatened more violence. ""In the coming days, we will carry out a number of attacks against installations and oil companies across the Niger Delta and will spread out to companies such as Total which have been spared in the past,"" MEND spokesman Jomo Gbomo said in the statement. ""We hope the actions which will follow will persuade Mr. Uduaghan that we exist outside of cyberspace."" The key militant group in the oil-rich Niger Delta is an umbrella organization of several rebel organizations. It initially called for a 60-day cease-fire in July and extended it in September, finally ordering a unilateral cease-fire on October 25. Now-ailing President Umar Musa Yar'Adua offered amnesty to rebels who laid down their arms, and thousands -- including leaders -- did so. With the cease-fire, the government looked to broker peace and an end to the disruptions in its oil industry. Oil bandits have plagued Nigeria for years, attacking pipelines and cutting production by over one million barrels of oil a day. With an economy dominated by oil, Nigeria is the 16th biggest producer of crude oil in the world, according to the CIA's World Factbook. In 2007, fuel and mining products accounted for 97 percent of exports, according to the U.S. State Department.

"(CNN) -- A last-ditch effort to put an end to the bloodshed in Syria failed on Saturday, with Russia and China exercising their veto at the United Nations. With that fateful decision, the conflict moved to another, more dangerous stage. Those who warn that Syria will descend into civil war are a bit behind: It is already in civil war. Now it will only intensify. In the months leading up to the U.N. vote, Syria's opposition has grown more militarized. Rebel forces, under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, gained considerable traction after a shaky start. The U.N.'s failure to act may have been the best recruiting tool the FSA could have hoped for, and its ascendancy is now a nearly foregone conclusion. Meanwhile, after first opposing any resort to armed resistance, the Syrian National Council, the country's most representative opposition body, has made an important shift. It has now ""pledged to support"" the FSA, and the two groups are attempting to increase coordination. Where does that leave the international community? The U.N.-endorsed norm of ""responsibility to protect"" (sometimes boiled down to ""r2p"") mandates a collective response when states wage war on their own populations. The Syrian regime, however, is making a mockery of the notion, with its brutal assault on the city of Homs just as the U.N. vote was taking place. Either the international community takes r2p seriously, or it doesn't. We have to decide. As I've argued before, military intervention remains premature. But, in light of recent events, the time has come to carefully consider the various military options available, determine their feasibility, and begin to judge whether they would cause more good than harm. Of course, no one should take such intervention lightly. But just as proponents of intervention must make their case for how the military option could ""work,"" opponents of intervention face a similar burden of explaining how staying the current course will work. If the opposition itself has chosen the military option -- and this seems increasingly the case -- then the question is this: Can a ragtag army of perhaps 10,000 Syrian rebels defeat an army that while, far from invincible, enjoys an overwhelming advantage in numbers, equipment and firepower? The opposition may have millions on their side, with Syrians continuing to protest en masse throughout the country. But it's difficult to see anything less than a disastrous stalemate without the international community helping to tip the balance. No one, to my knowledge, is advocating for an Iraq-style invasion with tens of thousands of American boots on the ground. The options being considered are far more limited -- funding and arming the Free Syria Army, establishing ""safe zones"" in the north and a targeted air mission to weaken the Syrian military's capabilities. To be sure, all of these are serious forms of military intervention, but bringing up the specter of Iraq can be misleading, just as it was in Libya. So we find ourselves in an odd but increasingly common situation, where Syrians themselves are more enthusiastic about foreign military intervention than Americans are. It is, in this sense, the reverse of Iraq, which was rightly seen by many as a tragic Western imposition. Here, it is Syrians themselves who are pleading for the international community to come to their aid. In December, the Syrian National Council ""formally endorsed"" foreign intervention. If they formally request military assistance -- presumably the next step -- we have a moral responsibility to take it seriously. Unless the Assad regime suddenly implodes -- a possibility, but an unlikely one -- this is the direction in which we are heading. The ""anti-imperialists"" will, as they often do, cry foul. This time, though, they will find themselves on the wrong side. None of the Western powers has come out in even tepid support of military intervention. Consumed by their own internal problems, this is not at all something they want. But it may be something the Syrian people need. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Most of us don't know much about Kim Jong Il, the reclusive North Korean leader who died Saturday. But thanks to a cult-favorite blog, we do know this: That country's ""Dear Leader"" spent countless hours visiting stores, factories and plantations and gazing stoically from behind his trademark sunglasses upon various things -- soldiers, machinery, livestock and lots and lots of food. The Tumblr-hosted blog, ""Kim Jong Il Looking at Things,"" gathers propaganda photos of the departed dictator from the state-run Korean Central News Agency and has built a steady following since it was launched in October 2010. The founder of Tumblr, David Karp, even named it as one of his favorite sites. The blog is run by JoÃ£o Rocha, 26, an art director for a Lisbon, Portugal design firm. Rocha said Monday he has about 375 unposted photos of Kim Jong Il in his archives and is leaning toward keeping the blog going. ""I don't have a favorite but I like the ones where he's smiling the best,"" Rocha wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""There's a certain humanity in them, I find."" In the first 12 hours or so after Kim's death was announced, the blog has gotten more than 1.4 million page views, up from an average monthly total of about 500,000, he said. Rocha has posted a poll on his site's Facebook page, asking fans whether he should continue the blog. As of Monday afternoon he had received more than 3,300 ""yes"" votes and fewer than 100 ""nos."" He said he got the idea for the blog last year after seeing a gallery of similar Kim Jong Il photos on the Boston Globe's website. Rocha found the images ""just too surreal to be true"" and ""thought it deserved a blog of its own."" With rule of North Korea expected to pass to Kim's son, Kim Jong Un, a copycat blog has already appeared showing similar images of the younger Kim. But Rocha doesn't seem to mind. ""That's how the Internet works. Out with the old and in with the new,"" he wrote. Rocha doesn't think the new blog's subject carries the same ironic weight, though. ""You need that absolute evil that Kim Jong Il personified so well to make it funny. Kim Jong Un lacks that."" Kim Jong Il's bizarre life as pop-culture icon . In the 14 months since he launched the blog, Rocha has posted hundreds of images of North Korea's dictator, flanked by an ever-present entourage and peering at everything from bubble gum to sausage. But asked what, if anything, his blog has revealed about North Korea and he draws a blank. ""They have very clean factories is probably the only thing I can say. The rest remains a mystery.""","Creator of popular photo blog about Kim Jong Il says he will likely keep project going .

"(CNN) -- There are a ton of old sayings about music: that it's the food of love, that it soothes the savage beast, that it makes the people come together (yeah). And for good reason: Over the years, music has remained one of the few things, genres notwithstanding, that most people can agree to enjoy. However, just as genres and sounds have twisted and changed over the years (just watch these elderly folks listening to Skrillex for proof) the way we listen to, consume and integrate music into our daily lives has also shifted and altered. Now, with the advent of the Web and advances in technology, music can occupy every corner of our mundane existence -- like a particularly pungent cooking odor, but in a good way. That's why this week, we're going to highlight a passel of helpful music apps that do more than just, well, allow you to listen to music. Instead, they help your mood, your schedule and even your love life. All of these apps live on Spotify's new app platform, a whole new world of services built by developers within the streaming-music service's desktop client. So stop merely listening to music. It's time to live it, too. 1) Moodagent . Everything sucks. You twisted your ankle, broke a plate, tripped on the curb, walked past a black cat, smashed a mirror, ripped your pants, had a fight with your boyfriend, contracted an STD (the reason for the aforementioned fight) and lost your job (did we mention your boyfriend was your boss?). How, oh how, are you to pull yourself up by your bootstraps out of the doldrums and myriad other cliches? Well, it's an oft-bandied-about assertion that smiling makes you happy, so why not find a way to add some twitch to the sides of your lips with Spotify app Moodagent? When you fire up the app, you can pick from an array of playlist moods -- Sensual, Tender, Happy, Angry -- or search for a song that evokes a certain mood and create a mix of similar tunes. Oh, and although many kitten posters say laughter is the best medicine, maybe after lightening your mood, you should also hit up your doctor. 2) Fellody . When seapunk emerged from the briny depths of the Internet a mere handful of months ago, you felt that that you were finally whole. You immediately went out and purchased a bottle of blue hair dye and various and sundry jaunty nautically themed vestments from your local Salvation Army and soon thereafter created a Tumblr replete with Little Mermaid/Enya GIFs. However, although your heart had been recently revivicated by that most viral of electronica currents, it still felt empty -- because you had no one with whom to share your oceanic ardor. Lucky for you, Spotify has an app for that (sorry, we really need to retire that phrase). Fellody is a handy dating/friend-making tool on Spotify's platform that scans your library to help you find lovers and friends who share your taste in tunes. See? There's plenty of fish in the sea(punk). 3) Seatgeek . The other week, an op-ed in The New York Times headlined ""The 'Busy' Trap"" got the Web buzzing about its assertion that people are so busy nowadays because society forces us to be that way/to stave off the crushing emptiness that inactivity breeds. No matter which side you take on the issue (""NO! I'm busy because I'm an IMPORTANT cat video-finder!"" or ""You're right. ... My soul would be black and empty if my schedule was likewise""), we can all agree that we sometimes miss our favorite bands when they come through town due to said busy-ness. That's where Seatgeek comes in. This Spotify app scans your music library to provide you with a handy timeline of bands coming through your hood, along with links to the best ticket prices. So give it a download and fill your heart void with live music instead of overtime.","Moodagent lets a user pick music according to a mood .

"(CNN) -- British police made mistakes over decades in their investigation of sex abuse allegations against late BBC TV presenter Jimmy Savile, a report released Tuesday said. The report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said not only did police around the country fail to ""join the dots,"" but policies made it difficult for victims to come forward to report the crimes. Scotland Yard said it welcomed the review. ""It is vital that we learn all the lessons from this landmark case and ensure our systems and processes are aligned to prevent someone like Savile ever committing such criminality again,"" the agency said in a statement. Savile, who hosted popular children's TV programs including ""Jim'll Fix It"" and ""Top of the Pops,"" was a household name in Britain for decades. He was also well known for his charitable work, having raised millions of pounds, and was awarded a knighthood. He died in October 2011 at age 84. Police began their latest investigation in late 2012 after a TV documentary broadcast in October sparked a flood of sexual abuse claims against Savile. Three months later, police unveiled a report exposing ""vast, predatory and opportunistic"" abuses by Savile across a span of half a century, involving about 450 victims. Nearly three-quarters of his victims were children, the police report said, with the youngest only 8 years old. Most, but not all, were female. The earliest claim against Savile, who was still a household name when he died in 2011, dates from 1955 and the latest from 2009, when he was in his 80s. Alleged sexual abuse victims of the late BBC entertainer are suing both the British broadcaster and the Savile estate, attorneys for the victims said last month. In Tuesday's report, Chief Inspector Tom Winsor called on police to improve their policies and practices to keep children safe. ""It is imperative that children and other victims of sexual crimes have the knowledge, the means and the confidence to report what has happened to them,"" he said. CNN's Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","NEW: Chief inspector calls on police to improve policies and practices to keep children safe .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When the new names of China's elite political committee were announced Thursday they didn't come as a surprise to one leading China expert. Rather, they reinforced the sense of ""a major opportunity lost."" ""This Party congress has sent a very clear signal that this leadership is politically conservative,"" said Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution, who predicted that the lineup wouldn't go down well with the Chinese people who he said were looking for signs of political reform. ""You can imagine the Chinese public may start to express some dissatisfaction with the dominance of princelings (sons of revolutionary leaders), with the elder and retired top leader Jiang Zemin's interference in the process of succession, and also that two liberal leaders Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang are excluded in the new Politburo Standing Committee (PSC),"" he said. As expected, the number of seats on the PSC shrank from nine members to seven and included the names at the top of many speculative lists:  Xi Jinping (President), Li Keqiang (Premier), Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Qishan and Zhang Gaoli. ""Of these seven people, it's really five-versus-two or maybe even six-versus-one because only two people are Tuanpai,"" Li said. Tuanpai are Party members who rose through the ranks of the Communist Youth League and typically have ties to outgoing president Hu Jintao. ""One of the Tuanpai members -- Liu Yunshan -- is actually very close to Jiang Zemin. So this lack of balance will potentially be a serious problem in the months or years to come,"" Li added. CNN asked Li for his immediate reaction to the lineup and the possible implications for Xi's term as China's new president. After months of mystery, new leaders revealed . What do you make of the new lineup? It is not a surprise but a disappointment. The disappointment is based on several reasons: First, apparently there was no intra-party multiple-candidate election for the Politburo and its standing committee. They were still selected through the old way of ""dark-box"" manipulation by departing Politburo Standing Committee members. Also, it's dominated by Jiang Zemin's protégés, especially the so-called princelings. Despite a profound sense of disappointment, I should say there are some positive things coming out of this leadership transition. One is that Hu Jintao stepped down as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, making the succession more institutionalized and complete. By and large, this leadership transition is another orderly transition in PRC history. The leadership change follows the rules and norms of age limits, and the turnover rates in all leadership bodies are all very high: 64% for the Central Committee, 77% for the Disciplinary Commission, 68% for the Secretariat, 71% for the PSC. The size change (from nine to seven members of the PSC), including the elimination of the police czar and the propaganda czar, is a welcome development. These are all positives but, in my judgment, this leadership lineup does not generate an uplifting spirit for the nation; I think this is a major opportunity lost. Some leaders, particularly the Tuanpai leaders, will be very unhappy. You need to give an explanation to the Chinese public why Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang -- two strong advocates for political reform -- are out. Opinion: Why China's reforms have hit a wall . Why are they out? The reason, in my view, Wang Yang is out because he is seen by many conservative leaders as a threat. Particularly as Wang's main political rival Bo Xilai is out, they don't want him to be in -- previously Wang and Bo tended to balance each other in terms of power, influence and policy preference. In many ways, both are very outspoken, very courageous, very innovative in politics -- they reach out to the public for support -- so in a way, some conservatives are very scared. In my view, this group of seven leaders is very capable in economic and financial affairs, but politically they are quite conservative. Read more: Bo Xilai stripped of last official title . How long will it take for Xi to make his presence or policies known? Xi will enter a short honeymoon period despite all the criticism and worries that have already emerged. The criticism may not be against him but rather against Jiang Zemin, against the dominance of princelings. He needs to demonstrate that he can provide new hope and confidence for the public with new economic policies. He should do so relatively quickly. He can't wait too long because a large number of people are very unhappy with rampant official corruption and growing economic disparity. He needs to do a lot on the economic front, but I'm a little bit concerned that because of the composition of the new Politburo Standing Commitee the political reform will be delayed. These leaders are not famous for political reform -- not like Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang. How will Xi rule? I think he will emphasize economic reform -- to make the middle class happy -- and to promote the private sector, to introduce more economic reform mechanisms, including banking reform and state-owned enterprise reform, basically with the goal to promote private sector development. Some of his team members, like Wang Qishan, Yu Zhengsheng and Zhang Gaoli, are all pretty capable in that regard. The problem is that economic reform needs serious political reform; otherwise, it can not go too far because of the political bottleneck. This leadership lineup has sent a very clear signal that it is politically conservative. What can Li Keqiang bring as Premier? In many ways, he's surrounded by Jiang Zemin's people who will tremendously restrain his power. There were previously a lot of people who wanted to block him from the premiership -- that failed. But now even in the state council, certainly in the standing committee, he's quite alone. What does it say about the enduring influence of Jiang? The backlash against Jiang Zemin will be overwhelming. Yes, Jiang's camp wins many seats in the Politburo Standing Committee, but in the future they may pay a huge price for this ""victory."" The public resentment will be very strong. These leaders are still selected by old-fashioned, behind the scenes deal-making and retired leaders' influence, not really through an intra-party multiple-candidate election. That's a big opportunity missed. That will undermine their legitimacy and credibility. Read more: Hu warns of enemy within . Why and how is Jiang still able to wield such influence? Because of the need to protect his interests and his family interests. To a certain extent his protégés also want to have him to help them, in a way. Jiang Zemin is strong largely because his protégés are in important positions. People like Xi Jinping, Zhang Dejiang and Wang Qishan, they're already well-positioned. Why has Hu failed to be the type of leader who could win out against Jiang's people in the PSC? It's still too early to give a well-grounded answer due to a lack of reliable information about what happened inside Zhongnanhai (Communist Party headquarters in Beijing). There are several possible reasons: One is, Hu wants to make a contrast between himself and Jiang Zemin. Jiang stayed in power for two more years after the transition at the 16th Party Congress. But Hu wants to immediately give up that position. So it is an institutional improvement. Secondly, his volunteering to give up that position makes Jiang's activity to promote his protégés in the past few months very problematic. The balance in the Politburo Standing Committee is broken, but the balance in the Politburo and the Central Military Commission -- between the two camps -- largely stays intact. There are many of Hu's people in the central committee. Consequently, this may create structural tensions between these very important leadership bodies.

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, may have to fold his efforts to push a measure legalizing online poker in the United States into a tax-cut bill, in light of strenuous opposition from Republicans. Such a provision would greatly benefit some of Reid's biggest campaign backers -- those in the gaming industry, which has been lobbying for the change. But when Reid was asked Wednesday afternoon whether he was still pushing the poker bill during the congressional lame-duck session, he said, ""We are still working on it,"" according to this office. Democratic and Republican sources had told CNN Reid was pushing for the provision to be included in the bill to extend the Bush-era tax cuts. One of those leading the opposition is Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, who vowed to block any attempt to include the poker legalization in the tax bill. Wednesday afternoon Kyl told CNN the measure was dead, saying, ""Senator Reid has agreed with me that it will not happen."" Reid's office refused CNN's request to discuss his push for the legalization. The support by the four-term Nevada Democrat, who won re-election in November, for the online poker measure is an apparent reversal. When Congress addressed online betting in 2006, Reid opposed its legalization. Some House Republicans also bristled at news Reid was attempting to shoehorn the Nevada-friendly legislation into the tax deal. ""Creating a federal right to gamble that has never existed in our country's history and imposing an unprecedented new tax regime on such activity require careful deliberation, not back-room deals or earmarks for special interests,"" Republican Reps. Spencer Bachus of the Financial Services Committee; Dave Camp of the Ways and Means Committee and Lamar Smith of the Judiciary Committee wrote last week to Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Between 2005-2010 Reid's campaign and his leadership political action committee received $224,450 from MGM Resorts and $113,450 from Harrah's Entertainment, making them some of his largest contributors, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of money in politics. MGM and Harrah's did not respond to requests for comment. ""It sure looks like payback,"" a Republican congressional official told CNN. According to a draft of the proposed measure obtained by CNN, large, established gambling companies would be the biggest winners if the legislation passed. It would legalize online poker basically only in Nevada and New Jersey. The draft bill says that online poker could be offered only by businesses that have 500 or more slot machines in the same building. That includes huge casinos in Nevada and New Jersey and would make ineligible most Indian-land casinos and even long-standing poker places throughout California because they don't have slot machines. Seventy percent of the revenues from a new internet gambling trust fund would go to the states sponsoring the poker, presumably Nevada and New Jersey. Only 30% would go to any of the other states where the person playing is based. Also the proposal includes new rules that would make it easier to bet on horse races. Republican congressional officials suspect that is an attempt to entice support from the senator from the biggest horse-racing state, Kentucky -- Mitch McConnell.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Authorities have captured one of Colombia's last great crime bosses, President Juan Manuel Santos said Tuesday night. Accused drug lord Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera was captured in San Cristobal, Venezuela, Santos said. Barrera is accused of alliances with paramilitaries and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group in addition to drug trafficking crimes over a period of more than 20 years. ""He is the last of the great (crime) bosses. This is very forceful blow,"" Santos said in televised remarks. ""This is a very important step toward the security that we want to achieve in this country,"" he said. The operation, directed from Washington, came about with collaboration between British, Colombian, U.S. and Venezuelan officials, Santos said. ""I want to thank the Venezuelan government, President (Hugo) Chavez and his team, for this great collaboration that has produced this capture,"" Santos said. The MI6 British intelligence agency and the CIA also assisted, he said. Venezuela's interior minister will discuss Barrera's capture and ""the seizure of more than a ton of drugs"" in a news conference Wednesday morning, the nation's information ministry said in a statement. In October 2010, Colombian authorities said they found more than $29 million and 17 million euros in cash stashed in two homes that Barrera owned. At the time the South American country's defense minister called it the ""biggest drug-money seizure operation in the country's history."" Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said Barrera played a significant role in international drug trafficking and described him as one of Colombia's most wanted drug traffickers, noting in a statement that the Colombian government had offered a $2.5-million reward for information leading to his capture. The statement said Barrera operated primarily in the eastern plains of Colombia, between the capital of Bogota and the Venezuelan border. An indictment unsealed in a Florida federal court in September 2011 accuses Barrera of conspiring to manufacture, distribute and import cocaine into the United States. If convicted on those charges, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, the U.S. Attorney's Office said at the time. 'Queen of Cocaine' killed in Colombia .

"Washington (CNN) -- Paul Ryan joked at the start of a foreign policy speech last year that ""it's nice to actually finally get out of my fiscal cocoon and talk about these issues."" The House Budget Committee chairman, a notorious numbers guy consumed by fiscal policy, then perched himself firmly in that cocoon by explaining to the conservative Alexander Hamilton Society that good foreign policy depends on a strong economy. ""If we fail to put our budget on a sustainable path, then we are choosing decline as a world power,"" Ryan said in repeating his personal mantra that fixing the nation's chronic debt-deficit problem underpins other major issues and challenges. Paul Ryan a big Twitter trend . The seven-term Republican congressman chosen to be Mitt Romney's running mate in November is well-known for his fiscal conservatism, part of a political orthodoxy stemming from his background as a devout Wisconsin Catholic with working-class roots. He adheres to similarly conservative stances on other major issues. For example, Ryan opposes abortion, believing life begins at conception. He defines legal marriage as between a man and a woman, and voted against ending the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that banned openly gay and lesbian service members. An avid hunter, he hailed a 2008 Supreme Court ruling that struck down a sweeping ban on handguns in Washington, D.C. On foreign policy, the 42-year-old Ryan expresses the conservative view that America's unique founding principle of God-given equal rights for all -- referred to as American exceptionalism -- makes it the rightful and necessary country to exert influence and leadership in the world. ""A world without U.S. leadership will be a more chaotic place, a place where we have less influence, and a place where our citizens face more dangers and fewer opportunities,"" he said in last year's speech to the Alexander Hamilton Society. Foreign policy shaped by budget battles . To no one's surprise, Ryan calls for repeal of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, both on fiscal and social grounds. He argues the 2010 law that passed with zero Republican support removes free-market principles from the health care industry. He also opposes how the Obama administration requires religious-affiliated hospitals and schools to provide health insurance plans that cover abortion and female contraceptives, arguing that forces Catholics and others to act against their churches' teachings. Frum: Romney blew it . The rule ""disrespects not only the religious community, but it also disrespects the Constitution,"" Ryan's congressional website says. ""By treating our rights as revocable privileges from our government, instead of inalienable gifts from our Creator, the President has put his personal political philosophies above the principles upon which this nation was founded."" Bennett: Romney nailed it . On immigration reform, Ryan follows the Republican Party line of calling for a comprehensive approach -- stronger border security, an effective worker verification system and no shortcuts to citizenship for those already living in America without legal status. He also opposes the DREAM Act backed by Obama and Democrats as too narrow because it only addresses a symptom of the overall problem by providing some young immigrants a path to legal status. The proposed law would allow some children of illegal immigrants who graduated high school, attended college or successfully completed military service to avoid deportation. With the measure blocked by congressional Republicans, the Obama administration this year took unilateral steps to stop deporting some eligible young immigrants and give them a chance to get two-year work authorization documents. Ryan sets domestic pace for GOP . ""We must first secure the border and stem the flow of illegal immigration, and then work to increase legal immigration through an enforceable guest worker program and by developing a more secure employee verification system,"" Ryan's website says. ""I believe it would be a serious mistake to pursue piecemeal reforms like the DREAM Act without first putting in place these fundamental components of immigration reform. The Obama campaign has seized on Ryan's conservative record, portraying him as a right-wing ideologue who would work with Romney to roll back social progress. Choice of Ryan a gift to both campaigns . In particular, Obama and Democrats argue the House Republican budget plan bearing Ryan's name would slash funding for government programs such as Head Start early childhood education and transform the Medicare health care program for senior citizens into what they say would be a voucher system. An Obama campaign website says legislation Ryan co-sponsored, if enacted, could result in a ban on in-vitro fertilization as well as any abortion, even if in cases of rape or incest. It also says Ryan voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that promotes equal pay for women. ""Congressman Ryan is a right-wing ideologue, and that is reflected in the positions that he's taken,"" Obama's senior campaign adviser, David Axelrod, told CNN on Sunday, adding: ""He is quite extreme. Good, good person, you know, genial person, but his views are quite harsh."" Choice may shift focus to Catholicism . Republicans rallying to support Ryan as Romney's running mate say his record as House Budget chairman, with bold initiatives to tackle the debt crisis, showed him to be a leader in comparison to what they call failed or insufficient policies by Obama and Democrats. The first poll on Romney's choice of Ryan, released Monday by USA Today/Gallup, showed 39% of the public felt ""excellent or pretty good"" about it, while 42% felt ""fair or poor"" and 19% had no opinion. The survey was conducted Sunday and had a sampling error of 4%. Ryan jokes spring up on internet . By comparison, a poll of the smaller sampling of registered voters four years ago found 46% thought Sarah Palin was an ""excellent or pretty good"" choice by John McCain, while 37% called the pick ""fair or poor"" and 17% had no opinion. Monday's poll also showed that 66% of respondents said Romney's choice of Ryan would have no effect on whether they would support the GOP ticket.

"London (CNN) -- In recent days, rogue Afghan security forces have killed six servicemen from the NATO-led military coalition, pushing the number of such fatalities past 50 in a single year for the first time. The death toll highlights one of the biggest challenges facing the coalition as it nears the end of its role in Afghanistan's war. These killings, known as ""green-on-blue"" or ""insider attacks,"" have increased substantially within the past two years, accounting for 14% of coalition casualties in 2012. Though statistically small compared to the numbers of IED-related (roadside bomb) deaths, these attacks have a significant impact on the coalition's mission in Afghanistan. The two provinces burdened with the bulk of green-on-blue attacks are Helmand and Kandahar. It is no coincidence that these areas are where the Taliban are strongest, and where the country's highest levels of opium poppy cultivation help fund the insurgency. Green-on-blue attacks began to accelerate in 2011, just after U.S. President Barack Obama announced his plan to pull U.S. forces out of Afghanistan and end combat operations in 2014, transferring security responsibilities to the Afghan forces. The success of the transition from NATO-led to Afghan-led forces depends on the competence and commitment of the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police. But the Taliban, operating from safe havens in Pakistan, say they have stepped up efforts to infiltrate both groups, and regularly claim responsibility for each incident. The spread of green-on-blue attacks has left coalition forces increasingly suspicious of the Afghan forces they are training and fighting alongside. News: U.S. restricts Afghan operations after 'green-on-blue' killings . Some Afghans in government believe that insider attacks are based on resentment towards coalition forces based on the increasing number of civilian deaths after more than a decade of the Taliban insurgency. In a step towards the transition, Afghanistan and the U.S. have reached a deal to curb night raids on Afghan homes, giving Kabul a veto over the operations, which are unpopular with local people. But although cultural and social differences may play a role in the increase in attacks, defections by Afghan security, sometimes motivated by economic reasons, play a far more significant part in the green-on-blue attacks. The U.S. military has tried to take action to prevent attacks by Afghan forces, appointing monitors to provide security for troops working with Afghans, boosting its counterintelligence infrastructure in Afghanistan, adopting an eight-step vetting process for Afghan recruits and revising the training they receive. In addition all U.S. and NATO troops were recently ordered to carry loaded weapons at all times. So far, though, none of these strategies appear to be stemming flow of violence, only serving to increase the trust deficit between coalition and Afghan forces . The Taliban have utilized green-on-blue attacks in their propaganda: Last month, Mullah Omar, leader of the Taliban faction known as the Quetta Shura, claimed the Taliban had ""cleverly infiltrated in the ranks of the enemy"" and encouraged Afghan government officials and security personnel to defect to the Taliban as a matter of religious obligation. One could argue the Taliban communicate better with the Afghan people than coalition troops, distributing internet videos through websites and mobile phones, which are becoming omnipresent -- more than half of the Afghan population is reported to own a cellphone. The anti-Islam video which went viral this month created a spark that quickly spread, engulfing the Islamic world in anger, with radical militant groups fanning the flames. Recent events provide reminders of what happened when the Danish Jyllands-Posten newspaper published controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005, triggering mass protests across the Islamic world and inspiring several terrorist plots. But the video may have even greater long-term consequences than the cartoons, especially in the age of new media. Once a video goes viral, it cannot be contained. The item may be taken down from some websites but it will be uploaded on others. It can be edited, altered, re-imagined, and sent instantaneously to fuel tensions and exacerbate problems. The Taliban may use this video to provoke resentment within the Afghan security forces on the one hand, and increase anti-Western sentiment on the other hand, potentially contributing to further green-on-blue attacks. The Taliban's aim seems to be to wear out coalition forces before the handover, and to diminish the West's credibility among the local population. They know the coalition's limitations and have been emboldened by the scheduled withdrawal of foreign forces. News: Quarter of Afghan insider attacks by Taliban, according to general . Coalition forces may be content to contain the Taliban threat to a ""manageable level"" before they leave, but this adversely affects their efficacy in the eyes of the Afghan populace. The Taliban have numerous advantages over coalition forces in Afghanistan: They have a wide recruiting base, and thanks to the drug trade they can pay recruits better than the Afghan army or police, giving them greater staying power. The number of volunteers seems to be increasing on a daily basis. It's worth remembering that the Taliban is not a homogenous group: It has many factions and is a mixture of characters from ideologues, warlords and land owners to criminals, drug dealers and people out of work. The displaced and disillusioned followers of the Taliban were molded by their country's history of violence, and the coalition's desire for a peaceful but quick resolution has resulted in a cheap, flawed peace initiative. The Taliban realize the West is under pressure and do not feel any desire or need to seriously negotiate when they can simply bide their time and wait for the withdrawal of troops to stake their claim to control Afghanistan in the future. The scheduled withdrawal of foreign forces means they do not need to make any commitment to prevent al Qaeda and its affiliates from returning, to halt the opium trade or to improve the rights of women. What the coalition does not seem to realize is that by firstly advertising their departure date in advance and secondly holding firm to their withdrawal timeline, they have complicated the situation and worsened the damage. Clearly, the hope of talking to the Taliban has failed. They are far from being contained and instead feel they are in the ascendency. Despite the enormous security problems that exist -- suicide bombings, IED attacks, and green-on-blue incidents -- abandoning Afghanistan will create lasting consequences. Not only will the Taliban reassert its authority throughout the south of the country through, fear, repression and discrimination, Afghanistan will again revert to becoming a cesspool for terrorist groups like al Qaeda. In addition, the cultivation of opium poppies will turn parts of Afghanistan into a narco-state controlled and sanctioned by the Taliban, providing resources to a terrorist infrastructure in Afghanistan and safe havens in neighboring Pakistan to plot and plan attacks across the globe, making the situation potentially more vulnerable than it was before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

"(CNN) -- Lawmakers on Monday approved legislation calling for government-funded contraception and sex education classes in the Philippines, a first in the heavily Catholic nation. ""Our legislature took an historic vote today for women and families as it successfully passed the Reproductive Health Bill.

"Islamabad (CNN) -- The Pakistani government came under attack from two angles Tuesday as the Supreme Court ordered the arrest of the country's prime minister and a rowdy anti-government rally took place near the national parliament. Even by the standards of Pakistan's often turbulent politics, it was a stormy day that ratcheted tensions ahead of national elections later this year. Cleric in Islamabad: 'It's the beginning of the revolution' The Supreme Court, which has clashed repeatedly with Pakistan's political leaders in recent years, issued the arrest order for Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and a number of other officials over allegations of illegal payments for electricity-generating projects when Ashraf was minister for water and power. CNN Blog: Pakistan on the cusp of change? Speaking on local broadcaster Dunya News, Fawad Chaudhry, one of Ashraf's advisers, called the court's decision ""a soft coup"" against democracy. The prime minister has consistently denied the allegations, he said. Rehman Malik, the country's interior minister, struck a defiant tone. ""Even after this order, (Ashraf) is the prime minister and, God willing, he will continue as prime minister."" But retired Adm. Fasih Bukhari, who is now the chairman of Pakistan's National Accountability Bureau, told reporters that the order of the court would be implemented. Last year, the Supreme Court ousted Ashraf's predecessor, Yousuf Raza Gilani, in a contempt case related to old corruption charges against President Asif Ali Zardari. The Karachi Stock Exchange crashed Tuesday on the news of the Supreme Court action. The KSE shed 500 points in just 10 minutes. Read more: 'Million Man March' promises to paralyze Pakistani capital . The arrest order for Ashraf was music to the ears of supporters of Tahir ul Qadri, a Muslim cleric who wants Pakistan's leaders thrown out in favor of a caretaker government to bring about electoral reform and flush out corruption. The demonstrators welcomed the court decision, chanting, ""Long live the Supreme Court."" Just ahead of the court's announcement, Qadri, housed in a bulletproof container, addressed thousands of people gathered near the parliament in central Islamabad, singling out the judiciary and the military as the only two institutions that he said were functioning in Pakistan. Read more: Malala spurs school-for-all vow, now deliver . He had previously called on the civilian government to disband by Tuesday morning to allow the formation of the caretaker government. That deadline has passed, and he has urged his supporters to continue their demonstration in central Islamabad and to double their numbers each day. Claims of a conspiracy . The timing of the arrest order against Ashraf appeared to play to Qadri's advantage. A senior official of the governing Pakistan People's Party, which is headed by Zardari, called the court's decision ""a conspiracy."" Speaking on Dunya News, Sharjeel Memon suggested the order had ""a direct connection"" with Qadri's movement. Read more: Pakistani leader meets protesting families of bombing victims . Corruption is widely considered a chronic problem in Pakistan's political system; Zardari has served prison time on corruption charges. And during his time as minister of water and power, Ashraf is accused of accepting kickbacks from power companies to approve expensive projects, known as Rental Power Projects, that in reality generated very little electricity. Pakistan regularly grapples with chronic power outages, with its booming population putting a strain on the public power grid. So the government had to rely on private power producers. Ashraf is alleged to have used the kickbacks from these private firms to buy property abroad. The accusations earned him the derisive nickname ""Rental Raja,"" and the Supreme Court eventually stripped him of his former ministerial role. Opinion: What's working in Pakistan . If authorities follow through on the court's order and arrest Ashraf, he will remain prime minister for the time being, said Salman Akram Raja, a constitutional expert. ""The court hasn't convicted him; he is an accused at this stage,"" he said in an interview on local broadcaster Geo News. The political drama set off by the Supreme Court followed unrest in Islamabad's streets earlier Tuesday. Brief clashes took place between security forces and Qadri's supporters as the crowd moved into the area near the parliament where protests regularly take place. Local media reported that police fired shots into the air and lobbed tear gas at the crowd. The unrest subsided after 10 to 15 minutes, and the protesters continued peacefully. Islamic scholar who condemned terrorism: 'I am not afraid' Qadri's supporters accused police of starting the unrest by trying to arrest the cleric, but Interior Minister Rehman Malik said police were doing their best to protect Qadri and control the crowd. He said the reported clashes are under investigation. Footage from local broadcaster Ary News showed chaotic scenes of people running and objects being thrown as gunshots echoed in the background. 'The beginning of the revolution' Qadri had already held a nighttime rally around 2 a.m. Tuesday after he and his convoy of followers arrived in Islamabad after traveling for more than a day from the eastern city of Lahore. ""It's the beginning of the revolution,"" he said, referring to Zardari as ""ex-president"" and to Ashraf as ""ex-prime minister."" But the group's numbers fell far short of what organizers of the ""Million Man March"" had predicted, with witnesses estimating that about 20,000 people took part. Read more: Pakistan in 2013: Yes, it could get worse . Malik, who visited rally sites Monday by helicopter, said the turnout numbers showed that Qadri's event had ""badly failed."" Qadri had promised a Pakistani equivalent of Egypt's Tahrir Square protests. After eight years in Canada, Qadri returned last month to Pakistan, where he is waging a campaign against the political elite. He has called for a caretaker administration to replace the current government and to carry out election reforms. Read more: Is Pakistan collapsing from within? His suggestion that the judiciary and the military weigh in on the composition of the interim government has raised concerns in a country where military leaders have repeatedly seized power and ruled for long periods of time. Some Pakistanis, noting that Qadri served as a lawmaker in the early 2000s, when Gen. Pervez Musharraf was leading the country, have suggested he may be working on behalf of the military. Qadri denies those allegations and maintains he is simply seeking to ensure a corruption-free electoral process. The current government and opposition have rejected his requests for a caretaker administration, insisting that nothing will stand in the way of timely elections and the democratic process. ""We will not succumb to these illegal demands,"" Malik said last week. If this year's elections take place without major difficulties, it would represent the first time in Pakistan's history that a civilian government made it through a five-year term.

"Rome (CNN) -- The Sistine Chapel is ready. The new pope's clothes are laid out. Now it's up to the cardinals. The work to elect a successor to retired Pope Benedict XVI begins in earnest Tuesday, with a morning Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. The service -- open to the public -- will be the last public event featuring the 115 cardinals who will choose the new spiritual leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. Cardinals taking part in the process will then walk to the Sistine Chapel, chanting prayers as they go, to begin the secret election called the conclave. After that, the only clue the world will have of what is happening inside will be periodic puffs of smoke from a copper chimney installed over the weekend in the Sistine Chapel. Black smoke, no pope. White smoke, success. Rome was abuzz Monday with preparations for the conclave, from the 5,600 journalists the Vatican said had been accredited to cover the event to the red curtains unfurled from the central balcony at St. Peter's, the spot where the world will meet the new pope once he is elected. Tailors have also completed sets of clothes for the new pope to wear as soon as he is elected. Video released by the Vatican over the weekend showed the installation of a pair of stoves inside the chapel. One is used to burn the cardinals' ballots after they are cast and the other to send up the smoke signal -- the one that alerts the world that a vote has been taken and whether there's a new pope. Workers could be seen scaling the roof of the chapel Saturday to install the chimneys that will carry the smoke signals to the world. When we'll see the first smoke is anyone's guess. The cardinals will probably vote Tuesday, but they don't have to, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said Monday. If they do, it's likely the first smoke might be seen around 8 p.m. (3 p.m. ET), he said. When cardinals elected Benedict in 2005, the white smoke signaling the decision came about six hours after an earlier, inconclusive vote, he said. It took another 50 minutes for Benedict to dress, pray and finally appear on the balcony of St. Peter's, he said. The longest conclave held since the turn of the 20th century lasted five days. On Monday, cardinals held the last of several days of meetings to discuss church affairs and get acquainted. Lombardi said 152 cardinals were on hand for the final meeting. Church rules prevent cardinals over the age of 80 from participating in the election of a pope but allow them to attend the ""General Congregations"" that precede the vote. On Friday, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, one of about a dozen leading candidates to become pope, said the meetings have focused less on scandals facing the church and more on spiritual matters. ""We cardinals sure are praying a lot,"" Dolan wrote. Contrary to media reports, he wrote in a blog post, the focus of the cardinals' meetings is much the same as it was two millenniums ago, namely: ""How most effectively to present the Person, message, and invitation of Jesus to a world that, while searching for salvation and eternal truth, are also at times doubting, skeptical, too busy, or frustrated."" He said, ""Those are the 'big issues.' You may find that hard to believe, since the 'word on the street' is that all we talk about is corruption in the Vatican, sexual abuse, money. Do these topics come up? Yes! Do they dominate? No!"" The scandals came up again Monday when the Vatican Press Office denied conclave accreditation to Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, who wrote a book about scandals within the Vatican. The book was based partly on documents leaked from Benedict's personal apartments. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi told CNN the accreditation had been denied because Nuzzi applied as a documentary filmmaker, not as a journalist. Meanwhile, the Italian press is full of speculation about which cardinal may win enough support from his counterparts to be elected, and what regional alliances are being formed. The United States has 11 of the 115 votes, making it the second largest national bloc after Italy. Sixty of the cardinals are from Europe and 67 were appointed by Benedict, who stepped down at the end of last month, becoming the first pontiff to do so in six centuries. CNN's Dan Rivers and Richard Allen Greene reported from Rome, and Michael Pearson wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Ed Payne and Hada Messia and journalist Livia Borghese also contributed to this report.","Tuesday's pre-conclave Mass will be open to the public, the Vatican says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Jeb Bush has been doing something he's never really done before: talking publicly about running for president. As he does the television interview circuit this week around the release of a new book, ""Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution,"" the former Florida governor and son and brother of former presidents is openly discussing his thinking on a run for the White House in 2016. Bush told CNN on Tuesday he wouldn't make a decision in the near future. Asked if he'll make a decision in 2014, Bush said he didn't know and added that ""the only thing I've decided is I'm not going to think about it for 2013. It's just too far out for me personally."" Bush passed on running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012. Instead, he's filled the role of a party elder statesman since leaving office in January 2007 after two terms as governor. Hanging over Bush is what can be described as Bush fatigue -- the idea that a Jeb Bush bid for the White House would carry his family's political baggage. His father, George H.W. Bush, served one term before losing his 1992 re-election campaign against then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. The elder Bush angered many conservatives by breaking his ""no new taxes"" pledge. Brother George W. Bush served two terms but left office in January 2009 as a very unpopular president, even among Republicans, who were angered by his support of federal spending increases and his 2008 bailout of Wall Street during the financial crisis. From Katrina to 9/11, Bush 41 opens up about his presidential son . That lingering feeling was a factor behind Jeb Bush's decision not to run in the past election cycle, even though some Republicans urged him to consider a bid, said CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger. ""One of the reasons that I think Jeb Bush decided not to run this last time was that he thought there was still Bush fatigue in this country,"" Borger said. ""So the question is, if you skip ahead, four more years, will there still be Bush fatigue? We just don't know."" And if Bush does run, his family ties will put him in uncharted territory, said CNN polling director Keating Holland. ""There have been plenty of presidential candidates whose fathers also ran for president, and a few whose brothers have been candidates. But if Jeb Bush throws his hat in the ring, he will be the first candidate in history who fits into both categories,"" Holland added. ""Does that help because the Bush 'brand name' is well known, or hurt because Jeb would be judged by the public based on things he did not do himself? Historically speaking, there is no way to tell."" READ MORE: Jeb Bush's controversial immigration proposals . But GOP strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro said Jeb Bush is free of the Bush fatigue, at least among Republicans. ""I think the Bush fatigue doesn't apply to Jeb. And even if it did, among Republicans it's been replaced with Obama fatigue,"" said Navarro, a longtime friend and supporter of the former Florida governor. If Bush does decide to run, and were he to win the 2016 GOP nomination, he could face off in the general election against a member of another famous political family -- Hillary Clinton. While the former first lady, senator, presidential candidate and secretary of state says she has no plans to run again for the White House, she hasn't ruled out a bid, and if she did run, she'd be the early favorite to win her party's nomination. And if Bush doesn't run, there's the chance we could see a future White House bid from the next generation of the Bush family. Both of Bush's sons are considering runs for public office.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona warmed up for their crucial last-16 Champions League second-leg tie against AC Milan on Tuesday with a 2-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna in La Liga on Saturday. The Catalans made seven changes from the team which lost 2-1 to Real Madrid last weekend as they look ahead to more important tasks next week -- overturning the Italian giant's 2-goal advantage from the first leg at the San Siro. Alexis Sanchez put Barcelona in front seven minutes before the break rising to head home Daniel Alves' cross from the right. The second half was tight with Barcelona dominating possession but unable to unlock Deportivo's defense. The decisive second goal came deep into the half when Lionel Messi (who came on as a second-half substitute) bagged his 17th consecutive league goal in the 88th minute, deftly putting the ball over goalkeeper Aranzubia. It wrapped up three points for the league leaders and stretches their lead to 14 points ahead of second-place Atletico Madrid's match against Real Sociedad on Sunday evening. Third-place Real Madrid travel to Celta de Vigo in Sunday's other evening fixture. In the other La Liga games played Saturday, Valledolid held fourth-placed Malaga to a 1-1 draw, while Real Vallecano move up to eighth after a 2-0 win against Espanyol. In France's Ligue 1, Paris St Germain came from a goal down to beat Nancy 2-1 at Parc des Princes on Saturday. Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a brace to take his tally of league goals to 24 this season and give the league leaders a five-point lead ahead of second-placed Lyon's match against Marseille on Sunday. Meanwhile in Serie A's only Saturday fixture, Udinese and Roma drew 1-1.","Barcelona warm up for crucial Champions League tie with 2-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Bangladesh on Monday entered the second day of a strike amid clashes between protesters and security forces that have killed dozens of people after an Islamist party leader was sentenced to death last week for war crimes. The violence, which has shaken the South Asian country in recent days, left 21 people dead Sunday, authorities said, after supporters of the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami attacked police stations and government offices. CNN iReport: Bangladesh protesters fight 'anti-Islam' label . The unrest flared after a war crimes tribunal on Thursday handed down a death sentence to Delwar Hossain Sayedee, a top Jamaat leader, for acts including killings and rapes committed during the country's nine-month war of independence in 1971. The sentencing of Sayedee, 73, followed convictions of two other Jamaat leaders by the tribunal in recent weeks, deepening political divisions in the country and causing longstanding tensions to boil over into violence. Human rights advocates have called on Jamaat leaders to rein in their followers and also urged restraint from the Bangladeshi security forces dealing with the protesters. Adding to the strains on the country, Jamaat-e-Islami and its ally, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, a leading opposition group, called on workers to go on strike across the country for three days starting Sunday. Thousands of supporters took to the streets to enforce the stoppage, causing disruption to businesses, transport and communications. Police outposts attacked . During the violence Sunday, stick-wielding protesters in the town of Bogra set fire to police outposts and attacked government offices before police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to repel them. Authorities said said at least 10 people were killed there. Thousands of people took to the streets in the northwestern district of Jaipurhat, resulting in clashes with police in which at least six people were killed, according to local authorities. Elsewhere, protesters cut down trees onto railway tracks to prevent a train from running, and overturned passenger buses and burned cars. Violence following Sayedee's sentencing on Thursday had already left 64 people dead, prompting calls for calm. ""The leadership of Jamaat should immediately issue public statements to its followers to stop these violent, unacceptable attacks against law enforcement officers and those who support the verdicts of the war crimes trials,"" Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Friday. He also called on the government to ensure security forces ""use maximum restraint and avoid lethal force unless necessary to protect their lives or those of others."" ""If cool heads don't prevail, Dhaka could dissolve into uncontrolled violence,"" he warned. The United States has express sadness over the loss of life in the recent unrest. ""While engaging in a peaceful protest is a fundamental democratic right, we believe violence is never the answer,"" Patrick Ventrell, a State Department spokesman said at a regular news briefing Friday. The 1971 war . Set up by Bangladesh in 2010, the war crimes proceedings are dealing with offenses committed during the country's war to gain independence from Pakistan more than four decades ago. Bangladesh had been the eastern part of Pakistan until it gained independence in 1971 in a conflict that claimed between 1 million and 3 million lives. Jamaat-e-Islami opposed East Pakistan's struggle for independence and has decried what it calls a smear campaign against it for its role in the war. The movement has called the war crimes proceedings politically motivated. So far, the court has indicted 10 people, seven of them top leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami. According to Human Rights Watch, ""the trials conducted thus far have been replete with irregularities."" In January, the court tried its first case and convicted Abul Kalam Azad, an expelled Jamaat member who is at large. Azad was sentenced in absentia to death by hanging. But the court's decision February 5 to sentence Abdul Quader Mollah, Jamaat's assistant secretary general, to life imprisonment rather than death set off a different type of demonstration. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, led by youths and fueled by social media, gathered at an intersection in Dhaka, saying the sentence was too mild and demanding the death penalty for those convicted of war crimes. Those protests, which have remained largely peaceful, have also called for a ban on extreme fundamentalist parties. Journalist Farid Ahmed reported from Dhaka, and CNN's Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.","Clashes in different parts of the country kill 21 people on Sunday .

"EDGEWATER, New Jersey (CNN)  -- People steadily file into movie theater No. 4, but they're not carrying buckets of popcorn or soda -- instead, it's Bibles and coffee. Worshippers sing at Joy Christian Fellowship, which meets at Edgewater Multiplex Cinemas in New Jersey. The sign above the double door announces ""The Proposal,"" the latest Sandra Bullock movie, but there's no romantic comedy playing on the screen -- instead, the lyrics to a Christian song fade in and out to the beat of the music: ""We are here because of you, because of you."" On this Sunday morning, the approximately 200 people on hand aren't here to watch a movie but to worship God. Some stand stoically as they sing, others sway back and forth with eyes closed, a few have their hands raised toward the ceiling. At the front of the theater below the screen is a six-piece rock band that continues to sing, ""Oh, beautiful sound. The joy of heaven here."" And it's here -- at Edgewater Multiplex Cinemas -- where Joy Christian Fellowship has been meeting for the past two years. ""It's not a traditional church setting,"" said Danny Han, Joy Christian's senior pastor, ""but we turn this theater auditorium into a worship place."" Reclining cushioned seats take the place of pews; the movie screen stands in for stained glass windows. An entertainment venue has turned out to be an unconventional yet conveniently popular religious venue, attracting a new crowd of worshippers deterred by the traditional church setting. About 200 churches are renting theater space under a one-year contract with National CineMedia, a nationwide multiplex cinema chain. That's an increase from three churches six years ago. ""The economy has had clearly a positive impact,"" said Kurt Hall, the CEO of National CineMedia, about the trend of Sunday theater rentals, ""as churches have found it more difficult to raise money to build their own buildings."" It's an alternative not only for small start-up churches that cannot afford space but also for large churches seeking to set up multiple locations. The movie theater offers a perfect setting: comfortable seats, state-of-the-art audio-visual technology, central air, ample parking, and prime locations. Joy Christian Fellowship leases two theaters from National Amusements, another multiplex cinemas chain, at $1,000 for 3 1/2 hours each Sunday. National CineMedia has ""Worship Solutions"" packages with negotiable rates. But what may have started as a practical and economical solution has surprisingly become a spiritual solution for boosting church attendance. Only about four in 10 Americans say they attend religious services at least once a week, according to surveys conducted in recent years by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. In Indianapolis, Indiana, the Rev. Ethan Maple decided that since people weren't filling the church pews, he would go to them. In March he started The Movie Theater Church. ""We're reaching out to those who have no religious background and also people who have been hurt by the traditional church setting,"" Maple said. His vision is not to build a physical church but to build a church community in a comfortable and unintimidating place. ""Everyone's gone to see a movie, and going to a theater to see worship is not a huge jump."" Courtney Gonzales said he had been in and out of churches all his life before he came to The Movie Theater Church. ""I really hadn't had a permanent church home and was always feeling sort of disconnected,"" he said, adding he was raised in a Catholic family but did not relate to the rituals. ""I never really felt anything was getting through to me."" As soon as he walked into the movie theater, Gonzales said, he immediately connected. ""I just felt comfortable, unlike when I had been at other churches."" Congregation members eat popcorn and drink soda while worshipping. The offering is collected in popcorn buckets. ""Sunday best"" is often sneakers, jeans and an untucked T-shirt. Song lyrics and movie clips that illustrate sermon points flash across the large screen. (And during normal theater hours, church ads are included in the movie previews.) ""Lots of pastors give us feedback that they've seen an increase in church attendance because they're in the movie theater,"" said Hall from National CineMedia, which has created a team of nine people exclusively focused on church-theater relations. At The Movie Theater Church, attendance for this year's Easter service was 268 people, up from 91 last year, Maple said. ""The numbers show that the congregation accepts this new church style."" It's a style these churches want to keep. According to National CineMedia, 67 percent of their church clients consider the movie theater to be a permanent facility. ""We wouldn't go any other way,"" said Chris Jarrell, a pastor National Community Church in the District of Columbia area. ""We see this as a long-term strategy."" Four of National Community Church's five locations are movie theaters near subway stops, including the Phoenix Movie Theater on the lower level of Union Station.  Watch congregants talk about having services in a cinema » . However, Pastor Steve Kelly of Wave Church in Virginia said staying in a movie theater sends a certain message to the community. ""The moment you define yourself as 'We're just going to rent this facility,' you're saying that you're not necessarily here to stay,"" he said. His congregation has been leasing theater space for five years while they wait for more members and money to build a facility on 31 acres of already-purchased land. Being a tenant comes with other drawbacks, such as the task of transforming the theater into a sanctuary every Sunday. Kuen Doo, a member of Joy Christian Fellowship, is in charge of setting up for the 9:30 a.m. service. His morning begins at 7:30 a.m. at a storage location, which houses 14 large black boxes on wheels that contain everything from music stands to speakers, church signs to drum set. ""It takes about an hour to load everything, come to this movie theater, unload, and help set up,"" Doo said. At least 17 congregation members are devoted to setting up and breaking down each Sunday. Joy Christian Fellowship has to clear out before noon, when the matinees begin, and theater No. 4 -- along with other movie theaters nationwide -- no longer belongs to the church.","Idea appeals to small start-ups, big churches seeking to set up multiple locations .

"London (CNN) -- ""We are One Woman, you cry and I hear you. We are One Woman, you sing, I sing along."" These are the words from the song track ""One Woman,"" a song that UN Women have launched to celebrate women worldwide on International Women's Day. Twenty five artists from 20 countries took part in the production, which was inspired by UN Women's own projects worldwide. The song was performed by artists who donated their time to create a message of hope and celebration. UN Women's aim is to engage listeners, and encourage them to join in the cause of women's empowerment and gender equality. Beth Blatt, founder of Hope Sings, wrote the lyrics. The aim, she said, was to signify the inter-relatedness of the world. ""We are all connected. Every woman's victory is a victory for us all,"" Blatt said. Full coverage: Leading women . UN Women's work in training female police officers, and men marching for women's rights, are some of the stories that Beth thought of while penning the lyrics. She then identified singers from China to Mexico to be part of the global project. Yuna Zarai, a pop singer-songwriter from Malaysia, was one of the performers. She said that the song is based on real women and the problems they face in everyday life. ""I have a large fan base back home. And this is an amazing way to teach all the girls out there, especially the girls in Malaysia,"" said Zarai. ""I feel like there is so much potential in them to be successful, and it's a good message to all the younger generations to just sort of believe in themselves and also take care of one another."" Zarai said the world does not understand the country's underlying violence against women. ""I feel like there should be more awareness and it should start from an early age. I feel like in school there should be an education about women and violence,' she said. Costa Rican singer Debbie Nova echoed Yuna's reasons for participating in the song. Nova said artists have a responsibility to use their voices and instruments to communicate powerful and positive messages. ""I think women in Costa Rica and Latin America in general are still very oppressed, The figure of a man is still very prominent as the traditional calling-the-shots figure in the family unit,"" she said. Proceeds from ""One Woman"" sales will support programs organized by UN Women.","The song ""One Woman"" has been released to celebrate women worldwide on International Women's Day .

"(CNN) -- American Robby Gordon faces disqualification from the Dakar Rally after stewards recommended his removal from the race because his Hummer's engine does not conform to regulations. The 43-year-old appeared the main challenger to car leader Stephane Peterhansel after winning both Monday and Tuesday's stages, cutting the French driver's advantage to almost six minutes. However, the ultimate decision over Gordon's fate rests with the French Automobile Sport Federation (FFSA), who must deliver their verdict within two months, although the loser could still appeal to motorsport's global governing body, the FIA, should he be thrown out of the race. The stewards believe that Gordon's modifying of the ventilation system, linked to his engine, improves its performance level -- a claim he denies. That appeal allowed Gordon to continue racing in the 377-kilometer 10th stage from Iquique to Arica in Chile, although his hopes took a further knock as he subsequently lost 15 minutes to stage winner Nani Roma of Spain after suffering damage to his car. ""I hit a rock with both right-side tires and, as you can see, this wheel is way out, so we've got some broken parts,"" Gordon told reporters. Roma's victory means he leapfrogs Gordon into second place overall, a massive 19 minutes and five seconds behind fellow Mini driver Peterhansel. Gordon is another 46 seconds adrift in third with just four stages remaining. Former motorbike star Peterhansel is bidding for a remarkable 10th overall win in the race and a fourth in the car section. Meanwhile, just 16 seconds now separate KTM riders Cyril Despres and Marc Coma in the motorcycle section after Wednesday's stage, which was won by Joan Barreda Bort. Defending champion Coma finished second to his fellow Spaniard on the day, while France's Despres came home fourth. ""It's the tone that's been set for the rally and I think we'll keep on battling until the end,"" Roma told reporters. Both riders have won the race three times, alternating victory between each other over the last six seasons.","Robby Gordon is facing disqualification from this year's Dakar Rally .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- A stampede on a university campus in Johannesburg Tuesday left one woman dead and several people injured, according to eyewitness reports. The victim was the mother of one of many prospective students who had gathered in the early hours to enroll in the University of Johannesburg, according to the African National Congress Youth League, the youth wing of the governing ANC party. Local media reported that 17 people were also injured. Thousands of young people and their relatives had gathered outside the campus gates hoping to secure some of the last remaining university places or admission slots for students. Some chose to sleep outside overnight, desperate to sign up. One eyewitness told CNN how the stampede began. ""There was a girl who tried to jump over the fence but unfortunately she tripped and the fence went through her from her back area so when the police came the people saw the police van as an excuse to jump over it to use it to go over. ""The first lady went over and I think that broke everything off because we were all looking at her, we never thought she would jump over. She jumped over, everybody screamed, clapped and started pushing their way through and that is when the commotion started happening."" Another witness recounted how a gate was opened ""and then people started fighting and running towards the gate, and then there was a stampede. People were stepping on each other, and I was also there by the gate, but I was able to survive."" Sitting among the debris of shoes, ID cards and blankets -- all discarded during the stampede -- June Moloro told CNN how she was accompanying her grandson to the university when they also got caught up in the chaos. ""So we came here very early in the morning. We found that there was a stampede. We had to run back, we couldn't go in,"" said Moloro, who is retired. ""After it was a bit tense and we saw a woman lying there, a dead woman. She was lying there. So it is a scary situation."" She told CNN that this was the second time she and her grandson had been waiting outside the campus trying to secure him a place. In a statement, the ANC Youth League called on the government ""to urgently put in place measures that will remedy the situation of many prospective students and fewer admission spaces in institutions of higher learning not only in U.J. (University of Johannesburg), but across institutions of higher learning in South Africa."" The situation is reaching crisis level, with the number of places available for higher education students now far less than the number of people qualified to take them, the statement said. The Youth League will work with the South African Students' Congress and education ministers to try to find a sustainable solution, it added. Some experts agree that there is an education crisis in South Africa. ""The crisis is one of young people who want opportunities and struggle to get them. There are not enough jobs, places at university, or alternatives like vocational colleges, nor enough money to pay for it all,"" said Graeme Bloch, visiting adjunct professor for the School of Public and Development Management at Wits University, another Johannesburg university. The country also suffers from high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people. Even after the ambulances had left the scene of the stampede, hundreds of people were still lining up behind the university's closed gates, hoping to be admitted.","Thousands of students were waiting by the university in hope of winning a place to study .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The suspect in the bombing and mass shooting in Norway believed the terrorist attacks were ""horrible,"" but ""in his head (they) were necessary,"" a man who identified himself as the suspect's lawyer told Norwegian broadcaster TV2. Geir Lippestad told TV2 late Saturday that he represented Anders Behring Breivik, who was arrested Friday after twin terror attacks that left at least 92 dead. Breivik ""is ready to explain himself"" in a court hearing Monday, Lippestad said. CNN unsuccessfully attempted to contact Lippestad. While they have only arrested one suspect, police in Norway have not ruled out the possibility that someone else may have been involved in the explosion in Oslo and a shooting at a youth camp on Utoya island . ""We're not sure it's just one person... based on statements from witnesses, we think there may be more,"" Acting National Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim said Saturday. A 32-year-old Norwegian was detained and charged with terrorism, but police have not officially released his name. Local media have identified the man as Breivik, who has been described as a right-wing Christian fundamentalist. ""It's very difficult at this point to say whether he was acting alone or whether he was acting as part of a larger network,"" Sponheim said. The suspect has been talking to authorities, but Sponheim described the day-long interrogations as ""difficult."" At least four people are still missing, he said, as investigators continued to search for bodies of victims of the bomb attack in downtown Oslo. The fragility of the damaged structures have made it a slow process, he said. ""We know that there are remains of bodies in the ruins of the buildings. And it's a bit of a jigsaw puzzle and a very difficult search. There are body parts in the buildings,"" Sponheim said. Seven people have been confirmed dead from the bomb attack. Police said that the explosive was in a car. At least 85 others were killed in a shooting at a youth camp in nearby Utoya island. Norway's prime minister called it the country's worst atrocity since World War II. Norway's King Harald also spoke in a televised address. ""There is still a lot that we do not know about yesterday's situations,"" he said. ""This we do know, that the situations in Utoya and Oslo is an attack on the nation. It's an attack on the core of the Norwegian democracy."" Official sources and social media indicate that Breivik might be a right-wing Christian fundamentalist who may have had an issue with Norway's multi-cultural society. The attack may have been politically motivated, one official said. ""I think what we have seen today is that politically motivated violence poses a threat to society and I commend the police for carrying out a very swift and effective investigation, but that is still ongoing,"" Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store told reporters. Other new details emerged Saturday about the attacks. An employee at a Norwegian agricultural cooperative told CNN that the man identified in media reports as the suspect bought six tons of fertilizer from her company in May. Oddmy Estenstad, of Felleskjopet Agr, said she did not think the order was strange at the time because the suspect has a farm, but after Friday's explosion in Norway's capital, Oslo, she called police because she knew the material can be used to make bombs. ""We are very shocked that this man was connected to our company,"" said Estenstad. ""We are very sad about what happened."" Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said Saturday that many world leaders had reached out to him after the tragedy. ""The world is with Norway at the moment. That will not restore the lives lost, of course, but it gives support and they hope it will help in their grief,"" he said. Together with Norway's king, queen and crown prince, Stoltenberg visited with victims' family members and survivors of the attacks at a hotel. Vivian Paulsen, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Red Cross, said that the survivors are in varied emotional states -- with some ""very vocal"" and others more guarded. ""Many of them are in shock, and they will need help for a long time,"" Paulsen told CNN on Saturday. The prime minister said it's too early to tell how the massacre will change Norwegian society. ""But I hope we will maintain"" the things that make Norway unique, Stoltenberg said. It was while authorities were searching for survivors of the mid-afternoon bombing that a man wearing a police uniform and identifying himself as an officer arrived by boat at Utoya island, about 20 miles from Oslo, where word was spreading among the campers about the explosion in the capital, said Adrian Pracon, a survivor of the mass shooting. The man asked to address the group, and then started shooting. According to police, the gunman was active and shooting for an hour and a half before authorities arrived. He used at least one automatic weapon and one handgun, police said. What followed, Pracon says, was panic and chaos as some campers ran from the shooter, while others went toward the man because they believed it was a drill or a test. Pracon said the shooter chased people to the shore, screaming at them as he fired. An elite police unit took the gunman into custody on the island, Sponheim said. The man did not put up a fight during his arrest. Authorities were searching the waters Saturday around Utoya, looking for the bodies of campers who may have drowned trying to swim to safety, police said. ""This happened at a place where I, in my young side, became politically active and I said earlier today it was a paradise for youngsters and yesterday it was turned into a hell. We have to regain this. Nobody's going to take this away from us,"" Stoltenberg said. U.S. President Barack Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon both talked Saturday with Stoltenberg to extend their condolences and, in the case of Obama, to offer assistance, those two leaders' offices said in statements. Ban's conversation came the same day that the U.N. Security Council issued a statement condeming the attacks and stating ""that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security."" CNN's Jack Maddox, Chelsea J. Carter, Holly Yan, Laura Smith-Spark, Joe Sterling, Moni Basu, Chelsea Bailey, Claudia Rebaza, Mishan Afsari and Cynthia Wamwayi contributed to this report.","Suspect will ""explain himself"" in court Monday, his self-described lawyer says .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations' secretary-general called once again Wednesday for a cessation of violence in Syria and for international action. ""In Syria, more than 5,000 people are dead. This cannot go on,"" Ban Ki-moon told reporters during his annual year-end news conference. ""In the name of humanity, it is time for the international community to act."" Ban told reporters he had given to the U.N. Security Council a report released by the Human Rights Council earlier this month detailing widespread abuses by the Syrian government. U.N. action on Syria has remained deadlocked in the Security Council, where China and Russia, among others, remain skeptical about the need for them to become involved. In October, the two countries issued a rare double veto of a toothless resolution condemning the violence in Syria. Refugees seek shelter in Lebanon . The U.S. State Department singled out Russia on Tuesday for holding up action against Syria. ""We think it is past time for the U.N. Security Council to speak up,"" State Department spokeswomen Victoria Nuland said. At issue is the so-called ""responsibility to protect"" -- the idea that the international community has an obligation to shield civilians from violence by their own government. It was an idea invoked for the first time by the Security Council in the March resolution that authorized military intervention in Libya. Some members of the Security Council, including China and Russia, have since expressed concern that NATO overstepped the mandate of the Libya resolution. The secretary-general strongly rejected that proposition Wednesday, saying the resolution was ""strictly enforced."" ""These changes of regime were done by the people, not by the intervention of any foreign forces or the United Nations,"" Ban said of the Arab Spring. He said he was ""encouraged"" by the Security Council's use of the responsibility to protect principle. ""We played an essential role in the liberation of Libya,"" he said. ""We stand ready to continue to help Tunisia and Egypt at their request."" Ban rejected criticism that he had not paid enough attention to the negative implications of the Arab Spring for women and minorities. Pressure grows for intervention . ""From beginning of this Arab Spring, whenever I had an opportunity of speaking or meeting with Arab leaders, I made it quite pointedly this role of women,"" he said. ""It's not just lip service."" Ban also drew parallels between the Arab Spring and the Occupy Wall Street Movement. Industrialization and globalization has created a global ""gap"" between rich and poor, especially among women and youths, he said. ""I have thought, with my senior advisers, very seriously how United Nations can be relevant, and can be helpful, in addressing these issues,"" he said.","""It is time for the international community to act"" in Syria, Ban Ki-moon says .

"(CNN) -- As the violence in Syria appears to be escalating, Britain and France are pushing for a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning attacks on protesters and calling for humanitarian access. The resolution makes no mention of the kind of sanctions or military intervention seen in Libya, raising questions about what outcome the international community sees for Syria. Are you in Syria? Share your photos and videos from the scene, but please stay safe. Here CNN correspondent Arwa Damon in Beirut and Richard Roth at the United Nations in New York outline what is happening both in and outside Syria, as efforts to resolve the crisis continue. What are the protesters demanding? Arwa Damon: Initially protesters wanted basic reforms, more freedoms, a multi-party political system and an end to emergency law. Some of these reforms have, on paper, been implemented by President Bashar al-Assad, but it was far too little and, by the time it came about, too late. The protests started in reaction to the arrest of schoolchildren in the town of Daraa for painting anti-government graffiti and snowballed into what we're seeing now. It appears that the bloodier the violence that is used against the demonstrators, the more galvanized and hardened they have become until they are now calling for the downfall of Assad's regime. The ideal scenario for the protesters would be a Syria free from the claws of the Assad regime, true democratic elections and an end to the secret service apparatus which pervades all levels of life in Syria. Has Assad made any genuine attempts to meet the demands of protesters? Arwa Damon: It would appear not. He did lift the state of emergency, which was a big deal because it has been in place for nearly half a century, and he abolished a court set up to trying people posing a threat to the regime, but at the same time arbitrary detentions have continued, as has the use of force against demonstrators. So although you could argue that he lifted measures in place for decades, nothing has changed. Is it possible that Assad could still ride it out? Are there any hopes for reconciliation? Arwa Damon: A lot of people I'm talking to say Assad's political career will not survive the uprising. But the question is whether he will be replaced in the short or long term. He could still hold on for an incredibly long time. I think there is a slight chance he could stay on, but that could mean widespread and unimaginable bloodshed because he would need to silence every single opposing voice. Also, importantly, there is no united international voice against Syria to impose the kind of pressure applied on Libya. Does the violence in Syria still appear to be escalating? Arwa Damon: It fluctuates. Some days are incredibly bloody while others, less so. The military seems to concentrate on one area at a time. First we saw Banyas and the coastal areas, then Daraa, then we saw the area on the border with Lebanon, then villages near the town of Homs and now we're seeing the focus on the northwest. But in general, there does seem to be an increase in violence. Is it likely the army will launch an all-out assault to crush the uprising? Arwa Damon: It would be difficult, given the troop numbers we believe are available for an operation to take place simultaneously countrywide. But that doesn't rule out other measures, such as the use of fighter jets. There are certainly fears from some in Syria that there will be a repeat of the 1982 Hama massacre by Syria's military -- acting under orders from Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad -- in which thousands of civilians are believed to have perished. Many activists are already comparing what is happening right now to Hama, but in slow motion rather than a single, devastating strike. The opposition activists say what we are seeing now is more systematic, sustained slaughter. Is there any evidence that senior officers are defecting? Could this be significant? Arwa Damon: There are reports but nothing concrete. There are a few YouTube videos claiming defections and a few people have been turning up in Lebanon, and in Turkey we are hearing, but I'm not seeing the kind of widespread defections it would take for the security apparatus to break down. It would take a major defection to have any effect because there would still be units loyal to Assad's regime. His brother, for example, is the head of the feared Fourth division and Republican Guard. Syria's military hasn't taken a sideline role like in Egypt or Tunisia, which means if the regime falls the security apparatus is likely to crumble as well because the people aren't likely to accept a military accused of massacring civilians to rule the country in the interim. Is social media still playing a part in the uprising? Is it likely to have a decisive role in the final outcome? Arwa Damon: It's huge. It's not the same as we saw in Egypt, which has been labeled a Facebook revolution because of the role of social networking sites. Syria is the YouTube revolution. If activists weren't posting videos to YouTube, we would have almost no window into what appears to be happening in Syria. Will it be decisive? Yes, absolutely. The reason why people have been able to have such a strong debate about crimes against humanity, about abuses, about the atrocities allegedly committed is because we've had these images on hand. Who are Assad's main regional allies? What effect is the Syrian crisis likely to have on them? Arwa Damon: Russia and China are key players, particularly when it comes to exerting influence in the United Nations. Turkey was a friend but now their relationship has cooled. Iran, however, is a huge ally. Lebanon is terrified about the outcome of crisis because anything to do with Syria tends to have a polarizing effect on Lebanon, largely because it acts as a geographical link between Iran and the Hezbollah leadership in Lebanon and the border with Iran's ideological enemy Israel. Why is there no likelihood of U.N. sanctions or military action against Syria? Richard Roth: The Security Council tends to build its approach on an incremental basis when faced with a country or issue that splits opinion. Due to history, location, politics and power, Syria has more allies than Libya at this time and so is unlikely to face similar U.N.-mandated action. Russia and China usually feel that it is not the Security Council's role to get involved in what they say is a matter for the internal affairs of U.N. member countries. That said, they may eventually budge to at least join the Council in expressing concern or condemnation of what is happening in Syria. But it will take more displays of Syrian brutality for Russia and China to go along with sanctions. Syria's key role in the Middle East peace process also makes military attacks extremely unlikely at this point too.","Arwa Damon: Slim chance Assad could cling to power but at cost of heavy bloodshed .

"BELFAST, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II shook hands Wednesday with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness in a historic gesture marking a giant step forward in the peace process relating to British rule of Northern Ireland. The handshake came 14 years after the end of a conflict that claimed about 3,500 lives, including that of the queen's cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten in an IRA bombing. McGuinness spoke to the queen in Irish as they clasped hands and made eye contact for several seconds in the ground-breaking public part of the event. ""Goodbye and godspeed,"" McGuinness said, translating his comment for the queen. She smiled throughout the encounter but did not speak. The handshake followed a brief private meeting at which McGuinness told the queen their meeting was a powerful signal that peace-building requires leadership, his party, Sinn Fein, said. He emphasized the need to acknowledge the pain of all victims of the conflict and their families, Sinn Fein said. Queen Elizabeth wore green for the meeting, which observers saw as a subtle outreach to Irish nationalists, whose color is green. Handshake the latest step on road to Northern Ireland peace . ""It went good, it went really well,"" McGuinness said afterwards, adding he is ""still a republican"" who opposes British rule of Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams welcomed what he called a ""historic meeting,"" saying that ""all in all, it's a good day for Ireland and a good day for the people of these islands."" Speaking outside the Irish parliament, he said: ""It brings our journey of relationship building within this island and between these islands onto a new plane. I would like to think we will build upon that."" Adams said some issues remained to be resolved, particularly the legacy of the conflict and the need for the relatives of those killed by British armed forces to have the facts investigated by an inquiry. But, he said, he believes the vast majority of unionists would be pleased that it was a ""real gesture beyond the rhetoric towards their sense of identity and their sense of allegiance."" The organizer of the event called the handshake ""a significant milestone on the road to reconciliation on this island and between our two islands."" Peter Sheridan, the chief executive of Co-operation Ireland, said he was struck by ""the ordinariness of the handshake by people who are in no way ordinary."" McGuinness has been a key player in ending the conflict between pro- and anti-British forces in Northern Ireland. Unionists want the province to remain under British control, while republicans want it to join the Republic of Ireland. Three decades of violence over the question largely came to an end with the Good Friday peace deal in 1998. The violent period known locally as The Troubles was marked by a full-scale British military presence in the province and deadly bombings and shootings in Northern Ireland and Britain. Unionists and republicans committed terrible violence against each other and against perceived traitors in their own ranks. A handful of people who disappeared during the Troubles have never been found. The queen arrived in Northern Ireland on Tuesday for a two-day visit marking her Diamond Jubilee, 60 years on the throne. When a handshake is not just a handshake . She met McGuinness, now the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, at an arts event in Belfast. Irish President Michael Higgins also attended the event. There were clashes between police and demonstrators late Tuesday night ahead of the visit, police said. Nine officers sustained ""minor injuries"" when they were attacked with ""missiles including 21 petrol bombs"" from a crowd of about 100 people, police said. There were also scuffles between pro- and anti-British groups in Belfast Tuesday night over an Irish flag put up on a mountain overlooking the city in protest of the Queen's visit, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said Wednesday. On Tuesday, the queen was greeted in Enniskillen -- the scene of a deadly IRA bombing in 1987 -- by crowds lining the streets and waving Union flags. She was greeted by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Owen Paterson, who accompanied her to a jubilee thanksgiving service at St. Macartin's Cathedral, an Anglican church, that was attended by more than 700 people. She also went to a smaller service at St. Michael's Church in Enniskillen, a Catholic church. Friday's confirmation that the queen would meet McGuinness prompted wide reaction in the British media. The trip follows the queen's visit to the Republic of Ireland in May of last year, which was seen as ushering in a new era in relations. The meeting has an added significance for the queen because of the killing of Lord Mountbatten. IRA members have also killed police officers and soldiers in Northern Ireland, who serve in the queen's name. The nationalist community in Northern Ireland sees the British as occupiers and wants their rule in the province to end. Queen's Northern Ireland visit marks symbolic end to conflict . Sinn Fein is the leading republican political party in Northern Ireland, and was widely assumed during the conflict to be the political wing of the militant IRA. Adams said last week that Irish republicans have often been prepared to take bold initiatives in pursuit of peace. In his remarks Wednesday, he said: ""Ireland is changing; it's changing because of the peace process, it's changing because of all the revelations of sleaze and scandals and corruption in this state, and it's changing because of the economic crisis. ""So people know we deserve a better society and republicans, like everyone else who thinks about the future and thinks about Ireland, want to be part of shaping that out, and the unionists are a very essential part of that equation."" The Queen's 2011 visit to Ireland was the first by a British monarch to the republic since it gained independence in 1921 and marked a reconciliation between neighboring countries, which once viewed each other with suspicion and hostility. McGuinness has admitted that he was a leader of the Provisional IRA during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between pro-British and pro-Irish forces. In recent years, he has received death threats from hard-line dissident IRA splinter groups because of his support for the peace process. The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The three decades of ensuing violence between the IRA and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people, most of them north of the border, and while the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 effectively ended the conflict, suspicions remain. Under the terms of the landmark accord, terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and their political affiliates now work together in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government.

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council Monday called for a truce between Thailand and Cambodia and urged the two Asian nations to begin a dialogue to end their dispute over an ancient Hindu temple on the border. The council issued its statement following a closed-door session on the conflict that included representatives from both sides and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ""The members of the Security Council called on the two sides to display maximum restraint and avoid any action that may aggravate the situation,"" said the statement, read by Ambassador Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti of Brazil, which holds the monthly presidency of the 15-member body for February. ""The members of the Security Council further urged the parties to establish a permanent ceasefire and to implement it fully and resolve the situation peacefully and through effective dialogue,"" she said. Border skirmishes, which started earlier this month, have killed five people, including members of the military and civilians, a statement from ASEAN said, adding that each nation accuses the other of firing first. The clashes stem from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. The building sits on a cliff in Cambodian territory, but the most accessible entrance to the site is on the Thai side. In a letter to the United Nations last week, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said that in addition to the human toll the fighting was taking, the temple had suffered damage. Conflict over the Preah Vihear site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was ""an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture."" But Thailand says the 1.8-square-mile (4.7-square-kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French occupation of Cambodia. In July 2008, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site, meaning the U.N. believes the place has outstanding universal value. Monday's meeting followed a request by Cambodia for an emergency session of the Security Council. The council heard from Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs B. Lynn Pascoe and Marty Natalegawa, the minister of foreign affairs of Indonesia and chairman of ASEAN. Hor Namhong, Cambodia's deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, and Thailand's foreign affairs minister, Kasit Piromya, also addressed the council. The council also expressed its support of ASEAN's efforts to bring the two sides together to find a solution. ASEAN foreign ministers are expected to discuss the conflict at their next meeting on February 22.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has indefinitely blocked travel for convoys, carrying food and military supplies to U.S. troops in Afghanistan, through a key mountain pass. Armed militants pose next to a captured armored vehicle near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. But in a statement, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan said, ""We do not expect any impact on ISAF's ability to carry out operations."" The decision to suspend travel through the Khyber Pass in northwest Pakistan was taken due to security concerns, said Gula Jan, a security official in Khyber Agency, on Sunday. The mountain pass links Pakistan to its neighbor, Afghanistan. It is in the Khyber Agency, one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the Afghan border. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants there have to be trucked in from Pakistan. Officials said militants aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda have carried several attacks there. The Pakistani central government has little control in the area, and the area is believed to be a haven for militants. On Tuesday, as many as 60 to 70 armed militants launched back-to-back assaults on convoys. The militants seized 13 trucks -- 12 carrying wheat into Afghanistan as part of a World Food Programme convoy, and one transporting Humvees to the U.S.-led coalition, Khyber Agency officials said. Jan said the decision to suspend travel came after local leaders met with representatives of some of the shipping firms. He said trucks will be allowed through the pass once the security situation improves, but did not specify a date. Dozens of trucks idled by the side of roads Sunday in the Khyber Agency and in Peshawar waiting for the green light. In its statement, ISAF said it has ""multiple, robust and complementary lines of support."" It added that for security and geographical reasons, ""the movements of civilian convoys destined for ISAF are coordinated with Pakistani authorities and border crossing points. The current temporary adjustments in convoy movements are as a result of this coordination.""

"Notre Dame, Indiana (CNN) -- The crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Syria has resulted in at least 3,500 deaths. The United Nations Security Council should immediately request that all charges of crimes against humanity in Syria be referred to the International Criminal Court. If the claims of gross misconduct by the Arab League and many national governments are correct, then something definitive would finally be done. And if the accusations prove to be wrong, as the Syrian government claims, then the court would confirm that. The Security Council needs to act because the court lacks jurisdiction to investigate on its own, since Syria has refused to join the court. But with Security Council authorization, the legal door opens for a full-fledged investigation that could reach President Bashar al-Assad himself and, if warranted, indict those accused of responsibility for mass murder. Russian and Chinese officials, who feel they were taken advantage of by NATO countries when they expanded the Security Council authorization of a no-fly zone for civilian protection in Libya into a military effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi's government, have resisted taking strong action against Syria. To encourage them to support a council referral of atrocities to the court, a U.N. resolution could explicitly take international military action against Syria off the table. This would also reassure members of the Arab League who oppose external military intervention even though some want Assad to resign. To obtain that reassurance, the Arab League simultaneously could ask the Security Council to refer alleged Syrian crimes to the court, while also underscoring its disapproval of the Syrian government's violation of its agreement with the Arab League to stop atrocities. An investigation by the international court could produce many benefits. It might deter heinous crimes, because Syrian officials would know that the world is now watching and ready to take legal action. If indictments resulted from the investigations, they would discredit any Syrian officials who refused to stand trial, even if arrests of indictees could not be made in the immediate future. If Assad were indicted, this would add strength to the claim of those arguing that he should step down. Indictments would encourage and empower democratic forces within Syria, while also helping to keep protesters nonviolent, thereby discouraging the kind of civil war that occurred in Libya. A Security Council referral might even put pressure on Damascus to accept a proposal being advanced by some in the Arab League to deploy 400 to 500 observers throughout Syria from a coalition of 16 Arab human rights organizations. Of course, Assad might refuse to allow them into Syria, fearing that they might find evidence useful for prosecutions. However, if he refused the Arab League offer to observe what is going on, that refusal would undermine his claim that officials are doing nothing illegal. Finally, a swift Security Council referral would place the killings of several thousand people and the question of wrongful conduct precisely where they should be: in a legal framework where the conduct of officials and others is judged against well-established international laws that few dispute. Such a move, in tandem with European Union economic sanctions already taken to freeze the assets of 74 Syrians and an expanding oil and possibly arms embargo, would reduce the likelihood of violence among Syrians themselves, discourage external military intervention and enable the council to honor its charter obligation to take responsibility for preventing armed conflict. An indictment could even produce a humanitarian consequence for an accused official. This is suggested by events surrounding Gadhafi's son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, whom the court indicted because of suspected abuses of civilians in the Libyan revolution. He and any accused Syrian officials might prefer going to The Hague to face their legal fate rather than run the risks of a more violent destiny closer to home. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert C. Johansen.","Crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Syria has resulted in at least 3,500 deaths .

"(CNN) -- Austria's Marcel Hirscher secured the World Cup slalom title on Sunday and maintained his lead in the overall standings in testing conditions at the Kranjska Gora run in Slovenia. The event was claimed by Ivica Kostelic, of Croatia with an aggregate time of one minute, 45.81 seconds but the big winner was Hirscher, who came 0.19 seconds behind the Croatian to finish top of the slalom standings by a distance from Germany's Felix Neureuther. Hirscher's lead at the top of the overall standings is 149 points from Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal and with four events to come at the World Cup finals in Switzerland he is well placed to defend the title he won in 2012. Ther 24-year-old knew the slalom crown was his after his nearest rival in the discipline, Germany's Felix Neureuther clipped a gate in his opening run. ""I always go 100% percent but today there was one difference between my runs -- I made a mistake in the first one and skied as I know in the second one,"" Hirscher told the official FIS website. ""That's the way I want to ski and it's good to be on the podium again. A big step is done and by scoring 160 points I feel the weekend was really good."" Rain lashed down during most of the afternoon but Hirscher was more than happy the race went ahead. ""If the race would have been canceled today that would have been horrible for me,"" he added. ""It was for sure on the edge of fairness but I think it was fair enough and in the end the best skiers in the world are still among the top ten. It's not ideal but we obviously can ski even when it's raining."" There was an extra landmark for Hirscher to celebrate. He became the first man to secure eight consecutive slalom podiums since Italian legend Alberta Tomba in the 1991-92 season. It was an emotional afternoon for Kostelic, who won in Slovenia for the first time in a little over ten years. He was in third going into the second run but received a slice of fortune when Frenchman Alexis Pinturault did not finish his second attempt. Kostelic said: ""It's a wonderful feeling as it's not easy to stay at a high level in any sport nowadays and Slalom is a particularly tough discipline where competition is really dense. ""This victory is a huge relief and it is very important for me. I saw there was a chance I could win here today but I was also aware that Pinturault had to do a big mistake. I was really pushing for a victory today, it was really my main focus."" The women's slalom event in Ofterschwang, Germany was won by Slovenia's Tina Maze, who has already secured the overall World Cup title and remains on course to win five crystal globes in a season. The 29-year-old posted a time of one minute, 52.85 seconds to beat Wendy Holdener of Switzerland by 0.25 seconds. Her victory took her in front in the discipline standings, replacing American teenager Mikaela Shiffrin at the summit. The 17-year-old came third. Maze now leads Shriffin by seven points in the slalom standings with one race left next Saturday. Maze's 22nd World Cup podium pulled her level with Austrian legend Hermann Maier, having already broken her points record in a season. Maze is now on an overall tally of 2,254 after this, her tenth triumph of the season. ""It's so easy to make a mistake in slalom and its so important to stay calm, that's the reason why I don't think too much about these records"", she told FIS Alpine website. ""Slalom is the most difficult of the five disciplines in my opinion and if you race in all of them, you don't get much time to train. I trained hard all this week to make sure I could compete with Mikaela and the other specialists."" Maze has already secured the overall and giant slalom titles and now leads in the slalom and the super-G disciplines. She is also still in with a chance of clinching the downhill title at next week's World Cup finals.","Austria's Marcel Hirscher secures his maiden overall World Cup slalom crown .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Last year, the U.N. Security Council authorized ""all necessary measures"" to stop the violence when the nation in question was Libya. It has come nowhere close to that on Syria, where the United Nations estimates more than 5,000 people have been killed since March. Why? Diplomats say the answer is simple: Russia. Tensions between Russia and the other permanent members of the Security Council have always been a factor. But diplomats say that Russia's conduct in its refusal to condemn Syria, or even negotiate on resolutions in good faith, have reached new lows. At this point, the only way Western diplomats believe the Security Council will be able to pass a resolution on Syria is with a request for intervention from the Arab League. Russia and China abstained from the vote on Libya after the Arab League and the African Union requested UN involvement in that country. In October, Russia and China issued a rare double veto of a sanction-less resolution that would have condemned the violence in Syria. Though China joined Russia in its veto on Syria, and India, Brazil and South Africa abstained, diplomats say that it is Russia that has been taking the lead in opposition to action. In Russia's view, NATO overstepped the Security Council's mandate in Libya, and they fear a similar mistake being made in Syria. Though Western diplomats insist they have not proposed anything approaching military intervention, Russia insists that the Syria crisis should be solved internally. ""I think Libya has been beat to death, overused and misused as an excuse for countries not to take up their responsibilities with respect to Syria,"" Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said. Last month, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin pushed the Security Council to open an investigation into civilian deaths in Libya. European and American diplomats immediately called foul. ""Is everybody sufficiently distracted from Syria now?"" Rice asked the media after a meeting called by Russia. ""Let us see this for what it is. That this is duplicative, it's redundant, it's superfluous, and it's a stunt."" ""This is not the kind of issue which can be drowned in expletives,"" Churkin countered the next day. ""You cannot beat a Stanford education, can you?"" referring to Rice's alma mater, saying she should be ""more Victorian."" Shortly thereafter, Rice's communications director tweeted a picture of Churkin's face superimposed on the Grinch, with the text ""rough day at the Security Council."" (Churkin later said that he ""thought it was a nice joke."") Despite Rice's high-profile tit-for-tat with Churkin, it is the four European countries on the Security Council, not the United States, that have taken the lead on issues Libya and Syria. Photos: Rare look inside Syria | Divisions deepen . Those countries -- France, Germany, Portugal and the United Kingdom -- have expressed deep frustration at Russia's scuttling of attempts at a resolution. In December, Russia held the rotating presidency of the council, which gave it significant power to determine the agenda. Diplomats complained of having to fight tooth and nail for even routine briefings. A senior Western diplomat said that Churkin routinely interrupted other diplomats and cut off debate. Churkin's conduct was ""outrageous"" and ""disrespectful,"" the diplomat said, who had ""never seen anything like the atmosphere in the Security Council now."" Western Diplomats admit that Russia has been using its close relationship with Syria to apply pressure on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But their criticism of Churkin's conduct at the Security Council is unequivocal. ""Churkin is practicing shoe diplomacy,"" another senior Western diplomat said, referring to Soviet Premier Nikita Krushchev's famous shoe-banging speech in the General Assembly. ""Russia and Syria are the last two members of the Warsaw Pact, and Russia is behaving in an imperialistic manner,"" another Western diplomat said. Churkin does not disagree that the mood is contentious. But he says that the root cause is a ""my way or the highway"" attitude. He called December the toughest of his five separate month-long terms at the helm of the Security Council. ""There is a lot of nervousness, a lot of expectations that things are going to be done my way or no other way,"" Churkin said. ""That what I need to have, I must have now. ... I think that if this trend were to continue it might seriously hurt the ability of the Security Council to work."" Russia surprised even its allies last month when it introduced its own draft resolution condemning the violence in Syria. Publicly, Western diplomats seemed encouraged by the move but privately were deep cynical. Western Diplomats said Russia had expected the Europeans and Americans to reject the draft out of hand, because it did not include some of the provisions they consider non-negotiable. (And, for example, they say it drew an unacceptable equivalence between violence perpetrated by the government and violence perpetrated by protesters.) Since then, Western diplomats say that Russia has not engaged in negotiation on their proposed additions. They also complain that Churkin has misrepresented to the media the content of closed Security Council meetings. He claims productive work on the draft Syria resolution, they say, when in fact he has been stonewalling. ""We are working all the time,"" Churkin said Tuesday of Russia's draft resolution. They have not held a single negotiation on the text since Christmas, Western diplomats say. Western diplomats admit that when it comes to Syria, they are at a ""dead end."" The only way around it -- the ""only game in town,"" as French U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud says -- is the Arab League. The Arab League has a group of observers in Syria, who were sent there to gauge the situation on the ground. Their report is expected on January 19. If that report is unequivocal about the Syrian government's culpability -- an outcome Western diplomats admit is a long shot -- then they may have enough political capital to push forward. And in-person briefing from the Qatari prime minister, who has been very outspoken on Syria, or the secretary general of the Arab League, may help to push Russia, they say. The Arab League report, a Western diplomat said, is a necessary condition for action. But it may not be sufficient.","Western diplomats say Russia is stonewalling all efforts to deal with Syria .

"(CNN) -- The two Swedish journalists convicted as terrorists in Ethiopia have opted to seek a pardon rather than appeal the verdict and their 11-year sentences, a Swedish official said Tuesday. Martin Schibbye and Johan Persson were convicted in December by a court in Addis Ababa after being accused of helping the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which Ethiopia has labeled a terrorist organization, and for entering Ethiopia illegally. The decision to try for a pardon ""does not mean any change in our view that they were there working as journalists and that they should be released as soon as possible,"" Kent Oberg, spokesman for the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN. Ethiopian troops captured Persson and Schibbye in July during an exchange of gunfire with the rebel group in the Ogaden, a prohibited region along the nation's border with Somalia, according to state media . In a short statement provided to CNN by Schibbye's mother, Karin, the two journalists said: ""There is a tradition of mercy and forgiveness in Ethiopia and we choose to rely on this tradition."" The Swedish Union of Journalists reiterated that Persson and Schibbye were in Ethiopia working as journalists. ""It will always be a defeat for press freedom when journalists are prosecuted, imprisoned and convicted when they are performing their job as journalists,"" Jonas Nordling, president of the Swedish Union of Journalists, said in a statement on the union's website. Karin Schibbye said in a phone call with CNN that this has been a difficult time for the family. ""I'm very shaken, but I'm starting to get used to it,"" she said. ""We live day by day. The first big shock came when they were prosecuted. The next devastating moment was when the judge found them guilty of terrorism."" She said the two men deny that they were in Ethiopia to support terrorism. ""They are innocent. They had no intention of disrupting anything in Ethiopia, no bad intentions at all, but now it is like they are in a trap,"" she said. ""The fact that they chose not to appeal means they now have to figure out exactly how this process of seeking a pardon will work, if they have to admit to the crimes or just apologize."" The pair sought ""the best possible advice,"" she said, adding that ""most experts have said that seeking a pardon is the best way forward."" After the trial, she said, ""They felt that their defense arguments didn't have much impact"" and ""They felt that it was very unlikely that another judge would see it any different."" ""This may take a long time, but they are ready for it,"" she said. Karin Schibbye last saw the two journalists just before Christmas, and she said the pair feels that they have great support from home. ""They are happy that their case has put a spotlight on press freedom and human rights in Ethiopia and that their ordeal isn't in vain."" Schibbye and Persson are being held under harsh circumstances at the Kality prison, Karin Schibbye told CNN. ""The prison is divided into zones with about 1,000 people in each zone,"" she said. ""In each zone there are small huts, with between 150 and 250 people in each, where they are locked up at night. In each hut there are only about 100 beds, so most people sleep on the bare floor. At one point Martin told me there were so many prisoners in the hut that they had to sleep stacked next to each other on the floor."" But now Schibbye and Persson have advanced in the prison's ""inner hierarchy,"" Karin Schibbye said, and they share a bed that is 90 centimeters wide. ""They have also sewn, like, a tent to give them a little bit of privacy,"" she said. ""But the light is never turned off and it is never quiet at night, so I think that is the hardest thing for them."" The men have put themselves on a daily schedule of eating and exercising to try to stay healthy,"" she said. ""But there is no room to exercise, so they jump up and down right where they are to at least do something."" The family is paying a hotel across the street to bring them lunch packets each day, ""and we've given them some dry food to cook at night,"" she said. ""But they have to hang it up in the roof so that the rats don't eat it. ... We should have given them metal cans instead of plastic ones since the rats can eat through the plastic cans."" Schibbye and Persson have also persuaded the prison warden to allow them to start setting up a library in the prison, she said. ""Now every time we go down there from now on we will bring a suitcase full of English books. So if anyone wants to help out and send down English books to their new library that would be great,"" Karin Schibbye told CNN. When the process of seeking a pardon can start is still unclear, the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.","Martin Schibbye and Johan Persson are serving 11-year sentences .

"(CNN) -- Less than two years ago, Myanmar's leaders were doing all they could to silence pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Now they're poised to welcome her into parliament. The sudden relaxation of political shackles on the Nobel laureate has raised the inevitable questions of why, and what do they want in return? One expert said Myanmar's new leaders, who were elected to power in a vote derided as a ""sham"" in November 2010, had tired of being ostracized by the international community. ""They know that their regime as Southeast Asia's number one pariah was always a 'free kick' for anybody who wanted to bring up human rights violations,"" said Nicholas Farrelly, a research fellow at the Australian National University. ""They always considered that their status was somehow not really deserved and that it was only through Aung San Suu Kyi's iconic pro-democracy role that they were singled out for such scrutiny and attention. Near clean sweep for Suu Kyi's party . By welcoming Aung Sun Suu Kyi back into the formal political fold, and also by trying to develop a set of institutions that are internationally legitimate, they feel that they should be able to pretty rapidly reposition themselves to become yet another Southeast Asian semi-democracy, and with that status they'd be able to enjoy all the benefits of full membership of international fora and everything that goes with that membership,"" Farrelly added. For almost five decades, Myanmar, a country of almost 60 million people, was ruled by a military junta that seized power in a coup in 1962. In 2011, control of the country passed to former general Thein Sein who resigned his army post to form a political party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), to contest the 2010 vote. He won the election, which was boycotted by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), and later condemned as a farce. Suu Kyi: Peaceful freedom fighter . ""It's pretty clear that when the early count was done in the last election the military was losing horrendously. They had almost no votes. Then suddenly it all changed and suddenly they won a horrendous number of votes, a massive majority,"" said Monique Skidmore, from the University of Canberra. Fast forward to 2012 and the political situation has changed dramatically. Citizens have just cast their votes in an election that included opposition parties who were even allowed the freedom to publicly campaign before the vote. ""It's remarkable and very striking for those living in Myanmar to see Aung San Suu Kyi on state television station and to listen to her on the state radio for 50 minutes giving a political speech,"" said Jim Della-Giacoma, from the International Crisis Group, before the vote. The April 1 election has not been without alleged flaws, but Della-Giacoma said irregularities were inevitable, not least because of the country's long history of military rule. ""The political environment has drastically changed and it's part of the determination of the government to show things are different now and politics are not being played the way they were back in 2010,"" he said. Hundreds of journalists and international monitors attended the April election, and while Suu Kyi's party claimed victory Monday in 43 of the 44 seats it contested, official results are still to be released. They are expected to confirm that the people of Myanmar want the Suu Kyi and her once-banned NLD party in parliament. While they're only expected to occupy 43 seats of 664 in a lower house still dominated by the ruling USDP, experts say being in parliament will give Suu Kyi and her colleagues an influential voice. ""If you look at the dynamics of the legislature, the two houses of parliament in Naypyidaw, they're voting all over the place. She (Aung San Suu Kyi) will have a very powerful voice, she is a very high-profile figure. She has an ability to pass amendments and move the parliament,"" Della-Giacoma said. Myanmar's deliberate change in strategy has already reaped returns for the impoverished country. Ahead of the vote, there was talk that a decisive step towards democracy was likely to result in the lifting of embargoes imposed to pressure the country to improve human rights. ""The election of Aung San Suu Kyi in a free and fair political contest would surely have to meet the criteria for getting rid of a large slab of the impositions that are currently put on the country,"" Farrelly said. For some countries, including the U.S. and Europe, it could take some time, Farrelly said. But for others, including Australia and Canada, the lifting of sanctions could happen relatively quickly, if it was agreed the vote was adequately free and fair, Farrelly said. Myanmar has already opened its doors to foreign delegations who have been advising the country on steps towards reform. The consultations followed several surprising moves by the government, who freed Suu Kyi from house arrest within days of being elected in 2010. President Sein's government went on to pardon hundreds of political prisoners, secure a ceasefire with Karen rebels and agree to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. Strict press rules were relaxed, diluting the culture of fear that had gripped the country. The confirmation of a seat in parliament for Suu Kyi would dilute that fear even further, said Skidmore. ""The era of fear is going to be largely over. So the feeling that one could be arrested at any time for holding a view that is opposite to the military, that should be severely lessened at the end of this election period. To see Aung San Suu Kyi having a legitimate political presence in the country will be psychologically enormous to Burmese people,"" she said. After declaring victory, Suu Kyi told her cheering supporters that it wasn't her victory, but their own. ""This is not our triumph, this is a triumph of the people,"" Suu Kyi said as she arrived at NLD headquarters in Yangon Monday. The international community has yet to react to the NLD's claims of triumph, but when it does, it is expected to have broad implications for Myanmar and its efforts to bring a once-persecuted party in from the cold.","Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is poised to win a seat in Myanmar's parliament .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho, the self-anointed 'Special One', has been hailed as the man who convinced Mauricio Pochettino to make the move to the Premier League and take the reins at Southampton. Real Madrid manager Mourinho, who enjoyed a hugely successful time with Chelsea, gave Pochettino a few words of wisdom on life in the Premier League. The Argentine, who was appointed Friday following the removal of Nigel Adkins, has previously managed Espanyol in Spain and will take charge of his first game against Everton on Monday. 'I hate my social life,' says Mourinho . ""I am very passionate about the Premier League,"" the 40-year-old told reporters. ""I have seen many games, the Premier League is an attractive league and I have spoken to people at length about it, people such as Jose Mourinho, who is a good friend of mine. ""He told me the best football in the world is being played here. How the league is structured there's a lot of respect towards the other clubs and that has only convinced me to come here, aside from the project that Southampton have offered me, the chance to work in this league I am very happy about."" The move comes as something as a surprise given Southampton's recent good form, which included a fine comeback to draw 2-2 at Chelsea in its last match. Adkins, 47, arrived at the club when it was second bottom in the third tier before winning successive promotions to reach the Premier League. The club is currently 15th with a three-point lead over the teams in the relegation zone. Flying high: Mourinho mentors Cape Verde's 'Special One' Executive chairman Nicola Cortese has been criticized by supporters for the ousting of Adkins with fans taking to Twitter to register their disgust. But journalist Gordon Simpson, who covers the club for the Southampton Echo newspaper, says Cortese's decision will ultimately be judged on results. ""The decision to sack Nigel Adkins has obviously come as a shock to many Saints fans,"" Simpson told CNN. ""It is not a complete surprise, however. It has been rumoured for some time that the chairman, Nicola Cortese, has been considering a change and there has been a sense for a while at St Mary's that Adkins has been living on borrowed time. ""Adkins is an enormously popular figure with the supporters here, and as you can imagine the news has been largely met with a degree of hostility and sadness. ""The timing is certainly strange, with the club having enjoyed a fine series of results and performances in recent months -- two defeats in 12 Premier League games tells its own story. ""Obviously, Cortese's decision will ultimately be judged on results. If the club continues to move forward under new manager Mauricio Pochettino's guidance then he will feel vindicated and supporters will quickly come to accept the change. ""But Saints' season is delicately balanced right now, and if results start to regress then the anger and frustration emanating from much of the fan base will only heighten."" Bielsa . Pochettino, who represented Espanyol and Paris Saint-Germain as a player, won 20 caps for Argentina at international level. Known for his readiness to use young players, he learnt his trade as a 16-year-old under the watchful eye of current Athletic Bilbao coach Marcelo Bielsa during their time together at Newell's Old Boys in his native Argentina. While at Espanyol, he took a club struggling at the wrong end of La Liga before establishing them as a competitive mid-table team by using the products of an impressive youth system. Southampton has a good history of blooding young players with Gareth Bale, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain just a few to have progressed through the ranks in recent years. Youth . According to David Cartlidge, Spanish football correspondent for Mirror Football, Pochettino's work with the youth players at Espanyol produced excellent results. ""Mauricio Pochettino's work with the youngsters at Espanyol was perhaps his most accomplished work while in Spain,"" Cartlidge told CNN. ""He understood very well the financial rigours placed upon his club, and reacted by developing a close relationship between them and first team. ""During his four year spell, 23 players were promoted from the youth set-up, the youngest being Paul Quaye, at just 16 years old. ""Not only did he develop players for Espanyol's own gains on the field, but off it too, as several were sold on for considerable profit. ""He would spend hours at Espanyol Sports Complex, going through videos and recording warm-ups to get insight on players. ""But he would also spend time with the young players, working with them just as he did with the first team, making them feel part of things."" Walcott . Meanwhile, former Southampton star Walcott has signed a new long-term deal with Arsenal. The England international had been linked with a move away from the club, but has put pen to paper following lengthy negotiations. The 23-year-old told the club's official website: ""I have made it clear from the start that I wanted to stay at Arsenal so I am pleased we have agreed a deal that everyone is happy with. What's important now is for the team to realise its potential and win trophies.""","Mauricio Pochettino has been named as the new manager of Southampton .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two former Kabul Bank executives accused in a scheme that siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars now face years in prison and massive fines. Investigators say the scheme cheated ordinary people's savings out of Kabul Bank in a case of ""fraudulent lending and embezzlement."" Former Chief Executive Officer Khalilullah Ferozi was sentenced to five years and ordered to pay $530 million to a recovery fund to help the fraud victims, prosecutor Nasrrullah Hemad said Tuesday. Former Kabul Bank Chairman Sherkhan Farnood was also sentenced to five years and must pay $278 million to the fund. The scandal that engulfed Kabul Bank has severely damaged the reputation of the Western approach to banking that it embodied in Afghanistan, one of the least developed countries in the world. The bank was meant to provide a transparent way for Afghan government employees -- soldiers, teachers and police officers -- to receive and retain their salaries without the age-old fear of corrupt superiors confiscating the money. Nineteen others face sentences of between six months and four years, Hemad said Tuesday. The sentences can be appealed.

"Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Security forces killed 20 suspected members of the militant Islamic group Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria on Sunday, an army captain said. Troops moved in on a meeting of the group, sparking a shootout, said the captain, who was not authorized to talk to the media. ""The Boko Haram gang, as soon as they saw the military arrive at the spot, they opened fire and the soldiers went into action. All of them were killed because they kept shooting and did not surrender or give up,"" he said. One soldier was also killed in the violence, which took place in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, said the captain. From its base in Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria, Boko Haram has waged a violent campaign of bombings of Christian churches in Nigeria that have killed hundreds and wounded many more. The group is also blamed for an attack on a United Nations building in the Nigerian capital of Abuja last year that killed at least 23 people. The group, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden,"" has referred to itself as the ""Nigerian Taliban."" It seeks to overthrow the Nigerian government and replace it with a regime based on Islamic law. U.S. officials have expressed concerns that the group is beginning to cooperate with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Northern Africa based affiliate of the group, and another al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia, al Shabaab, to target American interests in Africa. The United States in June designated as terrorists three senior members of Boko Haram. The announcement drew criticism from some on Capitol Hill who felt the State Department should have gone further by designating Boko Haram as a whole a terrorist entity. The terrorist designation blocks all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction of the three individuals named, and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with, or for the benefit of, the three.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Forty seven-year-old Australian ""adrenaline junkie"" Sean Langman will attempt to break the 50-knot sailing speed barrier with his half sailboat, half plane, after a serious crash last summer. The half sailboat, half plane uses technology known as supercavitation -- sailing just above the water's edge. Langman, a shipyard owner and yachtsman, is intent on beating the French-set record within the next few weeks, with the ""Wot Rocket,"" a canoe-style pod with a nine meter-long  rigid sail. The Wot Rocket is waiting for confirmation from the World Sailing Speed Record Council to attempt, once again, an unprecedented technology known as ""supercavitation"" -- sailing just above the water in a gas bubble created by the deflection of water. This is to to reduce the drag which is around 1,000 times greater in the water than in the air. ""Wot Rocket is so exciting as we push to sail up to three times the speed of the wind,"" Langman told CNN. In October last year Langman and his co-pilot crashed when they lost control of the vessel at 42 knots -- over 60 miles per hour. But after re-building and perfecting the vessel at a cost of half a million dollars, Langman is ready to try again. ""The exhilaration of sailing/flying is so big, you don't think about danger,"" he told CNN. Langman is certain that this time around he will beat the record. ""My only concern is we won't be able to keep control of the craft."" In case the pilots crash again, Langman says the most thing is to remain calm.  ""Last time I felt a mild panic as we were underwater. I just hoped the paramedics would get there in time. ""But really I feel very safe doing anything on water as that what I've done my whole life. I feel most 'in tune' when I'm on water,"" he added. The idea for Wot Rocket was conceived four years ago by Langman after he was inspired by the story of Burt Munro, the New Zealander who set a world land speed record on his modified Indian Scout motorcycle in 1967 -- played by Antony Hopkins in the 2005 Hollywood movie ""The World's Fastest Indian."" Do you think the wotrocket can beat the record? ""I came up with the idea in the shower. So I presented it to a group of engineers and said 'this is what I believe.'  Most said I'm a lunatic but one said 'I want to work with you'."" Langman joined forces with leading Australian designer Andy Dovell and sought input from Boeing 747 pilots for their aeronautical knowledge. He then had the ""Wot Rocket"" built using the staff and facilities at his various Shipyards. Finally, he teamed up with Wotif.com founder Graeme Wood who invested in the project because, as he explained,  he ""likes leftfield ideas."" ""My family think I'm crazy, but every time I've had an idea it's taken me somewhere. It's really about ideas versus science and trying to make it work,"" Langman explained. ""And no one remembers the second man to walk on the moon.""","Half sailboat, half plane will attempt to break the 50-knot sailing speed barrier .

"Washington (CNN) -- A group that protects the welfare of animals has released an undercover video it claims shows animal abuse at a Texas farm operated by the largest egg producer in the United States. The Humane Society of the United States says one of its investigators worked at the Cal-Maine farm in Waelder, Texas, for almost a month this fall and documented multiple abuses and food-safety violations. The video shows dead birds, birds stuck in their cages, overcrowding and what appears to be hens covered in feces. At one point the video shows a dead bird as eggs roll by just inches away on a conveyor belt. The short, edited video was shown at a news conference on Wednesday by the Humane Society's president and CEO, Wayne Pacelle. ""Our latest farm animal investigation documents inhumane treatment of laying hens and conditions that threaten food safety,"" Pacelle said from the group's headquarters in Washington. Pacell told reporters that Cal-Maine, based in Jackson, Mississippi, was unaware of the investigation and that the video was being made public for the first time. Pacell said he didn't know if the giant egg company had seen the video. Cal-Maine responded to the allegations with a statement on its website. ""Cal-Maine Foods has been a leader in accepting and implementing animal welfare measures. All of the Company's facilities are operated in full compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and permits. Each employee involved in the care and handling of our hens is required to review, sign and comply with our Company code of conduct regarding the ethical treatment of hens which requires employees to report any possible violations,"" the statement said. The egg industry has taken a beating of late. Just this summer over half a billion eggs were recalled after a salmonella outbreak was traced to an Iowa farm. Cal-Maine is no stranger to recalls. It recalled 288,000 eggs earlier this month when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration informed the company that eggs from one of its Ohio plants tested positive for Salmonella enteritidis. Salmonella, which is generally contracted from contaminated poultry, meat, eggs, or water, affects the intestinal tract. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, chickens can pass the bacteria to eggs because the eggs leave hens through the same passageway as feces. Alternatively, bacteria in the hen's ovary or oviduct can get to the egg before the shell forms around it, FSIS said. Cal-Maine says it sold over 778 million eggs in 2009, which represents 18 percent of the United States market. According to the companies website,  ""Cal-Maine has an industry-leading record in food safety with all of its 35 processing plants independently verified as reaching the highest level of safety by the Safe Quality Food Institute."" Over 70 billion eggs are produced a year in the United States, and the Humane Society would like to see the large egg farms change their ways . ""Time and again, we've found that these massive facilities caging hundreds of thousands of animals do not properly care for the birds ... It's time for the egg industry to embrace cage-free housing systems and move away from battery cage confinement methods,"" Pacelle said. Battery cage systems allow many birds to be housed in one facility but critics claim it's dangerous and cruel to the animals. The Humane Society would like to see cage-free housing but so far only 5 percent of eggs produced in the U.S. use this method, according to Pacelle. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration implemented new rules in July for large egg producers. These mandates include cleaning poultry houses that test positive for salmonella, rodent control, refrigeration of eggs during storage and transportation and buying chicks and young hens only from suppliers who monitor for Salmonella bacteria. The USDA says that as many as 79,000 illnesses and 30 deaths due to consumption of eggs contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella enteritidis may be avoided each year with these new measures in place.","The Humane Society releases a video it says shows animal abuse at an egg farm .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Rescuers are having difficulty identifying victims of a Nigerian plane crash that left some bodies dismembered or burned beyond recognition, an official said Wednesday. Dana Air's Flight 992 slammed into a two-story apartment building Sunday in a crowded Lagos neighborhood. The plane was carrying 153 passengers and crew. The grisly recovery has accounted for 149 bodies, but only 52 are identifiable, said Ade Ipaye, the Lagos state attorney general. Another 97 bodies and several body parts are not identifiable, he said. American authorities are helping in the identification process. Authorities said before that the crash also killed at least 10 people on the ground. They have not said why the Boeing MD-83, piloted by an American captain, went down Sunday. Authorities have recovered the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, which are expected to help determine a cause. ""Will not comment on the accident investigation,"" Ipaye said Wednesday. The National Transportation Safety Board in the United States said Wednesday that it was dispatching accident investigator Dennis Jones to assist in the investigation. The United . Nine Americans were among those killed, according to State Department spokesman Mark Toner. The department earlier said seven citizens, including Capt. Peter Waxtan, were aboard the flight, although a list has not been released. Waxtan declared an emergency as the plane was on final approach to Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos. Witnesses reported that the plane appeared to experience engine trouble, said Oscar Wason, Dana Air's director of operations. The plane appeared to be approaching the vicinity of the airport in Lagos high, its nose tilted upward, witnesses said. It crashed 11 miles north of the runway, hitting the ground tail first. The flight from the Nigerian capital of Abuja crashed at 3:43 p.m. in the neighborhood of Iju Ishaga, according to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. ""The plane pushed the wall of our building in, and it hit everything,"" said Kingsley Okeke, who was inside at the time. ""There was fire everywhere."" Nigerian aviation authorities have suspended Dana Air's operating license. ""As soon as we have concluded the recertification of the airline, if they are capable, then their license will be reinstated,"" said Sam Adurogboye, spokesman for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. Waxtan joined Dana Air on March 26. Previously, he was a captain for Spirit Airlines, based in South Florida, from 1997 to 2009, the airline said. He also flew for Falcon Air Express, a charter airline in Miami, CNN affiliate WPEC reported. Privately owned Dana Air began operations in 2008 and is based in Lagos.","United States is sending an investigator to Nigeria .

"LONDON, England -- ""Ocean Emerald"" is a superyacht with added wow-factor. Her startling appearance has made sure of that and in real life she is every bit as dramatic as she appears in these photographs. ""Ocean Emerald"" is the second time Lord Foster has designed a superyacht. We were among the guests invited to the superyacht's official launching in La Spezia, in northern Italy, when her celebrity designer and his team walked down the red carpet to cast his eyes upon his latest masterpiece. Lord Foster of Thameside is no stranger to eye-catching and dramatic design. His architectural firm Norman Foster + Partners is responsible for iconic London landmarks such as 30 St Mary Axe, better known as the Gherkin, and the Millennium Bridge. Foster is the master of the curved line. Imagine for a moment a photograph of the Gherkin split in two lengthwise and laid flat, recall the sweeping curves of the Millennium Bridge and you will see how he has managed to combine the drama of those two creations into what is arguably the most visually stunning superyacht of the year. Ocean Emerald is not the first of Foster's forays into the world of superyacht design. It was he who drew the lines for the Lürssen-built Izanami, a 58-metre yacht now called Ronin and owned by Larry Ellison. Launched in 1993, she is also a head-turner. Design and external appearance aside, Ocean Emerald is different from every other 41-metre superyacht in that she is not to be the sole property of any one owner. This perhaps is one of the reasons for her radical look as she is designed to appeal to those who are new to the concept of superyacht ownership. Unlike the traditional form of ownership, where one person, sometimes through an anonymous corporation, is the owner of all 64 shares of the yacht, the shares in Ocean Emerald are split either into eight or sixteen parts. These fractions -- one-eighth or one-sixteenth -- of Ocean Emerald have been sold to different individuals by the London-based company YachtPlus. When engaged to design the yacht, the Foster team were initially told to work within the confines of an existing hull designed by yacht builders Intermarine, part of Rodriquez Cantieri Navale. But after discussions, Rodriquez has produced a new 41-metre hull three metres longer than the original concept. Walking around Ocean Emerald, it is clear that Foster has taken all the traditional rules of yacht design, torn them up and started again. The public rooms benefit from abundant natural light, which floods in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, in addition to the copious artificial lights. Coupled with the use of pale-coloured woods, soft furnishings and white high-gloss, wipe-clean surfaces they create a wonderfully bright, modern feel. Unusually for a motor yacht, the natural teak decking extends right the way through from the aft deck to the saloon, ensuring a seamless visual transition between the outside and inside spaces. To join the Ownership Lifestyle Programme will cost an initial payment of €1.875 million. This buys you a one eighth share of the yacht and guarantees 30 nights per year on board -- ten nights peak season in the Mediterranean, ten nights peak season in the Caribbean, and two five-night cultural tours such as sightseeing, shopping, golf, Formula 1, vineyard visits and museums. Each year there will be an annual service charge of €200,000 to cover overheads, including marine and hotel operations, permanent crew, mooring and berthing fees, year-round maintenance and mechanical upkeep, marine and port charges and cruise itineraries management. Lord Foster said: ""With my team we have given a new emphasis to such issues as quality and quantity of space, outdoor terraces, light and views. Our commission is for the total design concept of the fleet, with an eye on beauty, function and luxury, down to the smallest detail. We believe that there is great potential in the concept of luxury cruisers to think afresh such issues as views, light, privacy and the quality of spaces -- both inside and outdoors."" The concept of fractional ownership is fast becoming acknowledged as a logical way forward for those wishing to enjoy high-end luxury products without the massive capital investement required. Foster himself owns one of the shares and is very much looking forward to experiencing what it is like to step into the shoes of a superyacht owner. It may only be for a fraction of the time but it is also, as he so eloquently puts it, only for a fraction of the price. Subscribe to SuperYachtWorld . COPYRIGHT ©  2009 IPC MEDIA LTD.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate began formal debate Thursday on a new nuclear arms treaty with Russia, a top presidential priority that conservative Republicans had tried to block in the current lame-duck session of Congress. However, the chamber moved on to other issues on Thursday night, leaving open the question of when it would vote on ratifying the pact. With the current lame-duck session of Congress approaching conclusion, Senate Democrats were trying to make progress on considering the treaty despite a Republican threat to block any legislation brought up before the Senate acts on a measure authorizing continued government spending. On Wednesday, senators voted 66-32 to take up the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New START, which would resume mutual inspections of U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals while limiting both nations to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each. The accord cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in September, and has been endorsed by some leading Republican figures, including former President George H.W. Bush and Sen. Richard Luger of Indiana, the ranking GOP member of foreign relations panel. In a recent Washington Post editorial, five big guns of Republican foreign policy -- former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger and Colin Powell -- urged their fellow Republicans to support the treaty, which they say is ""is clearly in our national interest."" Republicans had pledged to block consideration of any other legislative items until passage of both the spending measure and a tax package negotiated by the White House and congressional Republicans. The current resolution authorizing government spending runs out Saturday, requiring congressional approval of a new one to cover the rest of the fiscal year. Reid said Thursday the Senate will remain in session to complete its work, even it means cutting into the upcoming holiday recess originally scheduled to begin Saturday. Debate on the START accord could resume Friday and continue next week, he said, adding that Republicans can offer amendments if desired. Reid has insisted that he has sufficient support to ratify the treaty. But some Senate Republicans have opposed bringing the measure up with so little time left in the lame-duck session. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, told reporters Wednesday that a rushed schedule to debate the treaty would prevent Republican senators from being able to offer substantive amendments that require serious debate. He expressed ""great frustration and disappointment"" with what he called the refusal of Reid and Senate Democrats to put off the debate until there is time to do it properly in the new Congress that convenes in early January. However, Senate Democrats said Kyl and Republicans have been given plenty of opportunities to discuss and influence the treaty, and now must show that they truly want it to go forward instead of continuing to delay it. Ratification requires support from two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes. Democrats currently control 58 seats and need nine Republicans for ratification. In the new congressional session, the Democrats will have only 53 seats and would need 14 Republican votes to ratify the treaty.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke was in critical condition at a Washington hospital Sunday night, after undergoing surgery on Saturday to repair a tear in his aorta, the State Department said. Holbrooke underwent another procedure on Sunday to improve his circulation, the department said in a statement Sunday night. Relatives, friends, colleagues and staff are by his side, and his wife Kati Marton spoke Sunday with Afghan President Hamid Kharzai and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The State Department did not provide details of Marton's conversation with the presidents. Appearing earlier in the day on the CNN program ""State of the Union,"" senior White House adviser David Axelrod said that Holbrooke was ""fighting"" the heart problem at George Washington University Hospital. He called President Barack Obama's special representative to Pakistan and Afghanistan ""a very tough person."" ""Many people would have succumbed,"" Axelrod said of the rupture. Holbrooke, 69, fell ill Friday morning during a meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and walked down to the department's medical unit, a senior State Department official said. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital, the official said. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta said the tearing of one of the layers of the walls of the aorta ""happens suddenly."" It typically is associated with high blood pressure and typically occurs in men between the ages of 50 and 70. The location of the tear ""would determine what, if any, other side effects would occur,"" Gupta said, adding that ""this is different from a problem people think of with the heart where some of the blood vessels going to the heart become blocked."" An operation ""typically involves bringing layers of the aorta back together so that no further dissection can occur,"" Gupta said. ""If that's done quickly and the aorta is intact, meaning it hasn't opened up, that can be a very good procedure and can take care of the problem."" After doctors completed surgery on his aorta Saturday morning, Holbrooke was joined by his family, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. Secretary Clinton visited Holbrooke at the hospital on Saturday, the State Department said. Holbrooke is a career diplomat best known for brokering the peace agreement between Bosnian factions in 1995 that became the Dayton accords. President Barack Obama called the diplomat's wife, Kati, and told her he and first lady Michelle Obama have Holbrooke in their prayers, the White House said in a statement. ""Richard Holbrooke is a towering figure in American foreign policy, a critical member of my Afghanistan and Pakistan team, and a tireless public servant who has won the admiration of the American people and people around the world,"" the president said.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- A German worker was kidnapped Thursday in Kano, a northern Nigerian city wracked by violence, police said. The man, whose name was not given, works for the construction company Dantata and Sawoe, Kano police said. A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry said officials were looking into the reports. The man was abducted from one of the company's road building projects on a bridge on the outskirts of the city, police said. Officials with Dantata and Sawoe could not be reached immediately for comment. A manhunt is under way. Police said they had no immediate ""clear suspicions"" as to whether the kidnapping was carried out by Boko Haram or criminal groups. Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group, is not known to have previously orchestrated the kidnappings of foreign workers. Abductions by criminal gangs in Nigeria are rife. Most recently, the U.S. Embassy in Abuja confirmed that a U.S. citizen was kidnapped in Nigeria's Delta State. Violence last Friday in Kano, including bombings and shootings, left more than 200 people dead, according to community leaders in Nigeria's second largest city. President Goodluck Jonathan toured the city Sunday after attacks left the police headquarters and other government buildings in charred ruins. A joint military task force arrested 158 suspected members of Boko Haram, security sources told CNN Tuesday.

"Washington (CNN) -- A new political reality hits Washington next week, with the first split Congress since 2002 raising questions about whether the bipartisan cooperation of the recently concluded lame-duck session can continue. Conventional wisdom says the shift from one party controlling both chambers, as Democrats have done since 2006, to the GOP taking over the House and holding a stronger minority stake in the Senate means increased partisan impasse over the next two years. But that same conventional wisdom got turned on its head after November 2, when the electoral ""shellacking"" delivered to President Barack Obama and the Democrats was followed by one of the most productive post-election congressional conclusions in history. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs attributed the new bipartisanship of the post-election period to the Republican gains in the November vote. ""There was a responsibility of government that I think the Republicans got in the November elections and they began to understand that responsibility a little bit more in this lame-duck session than they had in the previous, quite frankly, 18 months or so,"" Gibbs said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Republicans can no longer afford to ""simply sit and say no,"" Gibbs said, referring to the obstructive posture that GOP leaders generally struck in Obama's first two years in office. Instead, he called for Republicans to be part of a constructive conversation, at least in 2011 before the presidential campaign of 2012 really heats up. Some liberals accused Obama of giving in too easily to Republican demands on some issues, particularly in cutting a deal that extended Bush-era tax cuts to everyone after Obama had campaigned on allowing tax rates of the wealthy to return to higher levels. White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett told the NBC program ""Meet the Press"" that the new reality in Washington requires such compromise in order to do what's best for the American people, rather than one political party or another. The tax deal, while giving Republicans the extended cuts they wanted as well as a lower estate tax than scheduled, also provided extended jobless benefits and other tax credits sought by Obama and Democrats, Jarrett noted. ""We can't ignore the realities of the membership and the makeup of Congress and the fact that we are going to need bipartisan support to get things done,"" Jarrett said. The tax deal was followed by congressional approval of a series of Democratic-supported measures that had been held up by Republican opposition, including a major nuclear arms treaty with Russia and the repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy banning openly gay and lesbian service members from the military. Now, the issues only get tougher. With unemployment still close to 10 percent and the federal deficit continuing to expand, Obama and leaders of both parties say they need to find a way to both accelerate recovery from economic recession while devising long-term policies and strategies to better balance revenue and spending. A sweeping deficit reduction plan devised by a bipartisan commission appointed by Obama recommended spending cuts, tax increases, adjustments to Social Security and other proposals normally considered politically taboo. The plan won approval from a majority of the panel numbers, but lacked enough support to require a congressional vote on it. Gibbs said Obama wants to strengthen Social Security and Medicare to ensure future solvency while also addressing the growing federal deficit and one of his top priorities -- improving education in the United States. However, Republicans have made clear that cutting spending is their top priority. Incoming House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, is promising weekly votes on spending cuts, and conservative Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma warned of a national catastrophe if the deficit doesn't get reduced. ""There will not be one American that will not be called to sacrifice"" under the needed spending cuts to deal with the deficit, Coburn said on ""FOX News Sunday."" While acknowledging that ""those that are more well-to-do will be called to sacrifice to a greater extent"" -- a traditional Democratic stance -- Coburn said the increased spending of the past decade under both Obama and former President George W. Bush required immediate and significant cuts to show financial markets and investors here and abroad that the United States is serious about balancing its books. The tax deal means that hundreds of billions of dollars that would have been raised in higher income taxes and expired tax cuts will instead get spent in the economy, Coburn noted. ""So I think there is no problem that we could cut $100 or $200 billion and start making a down payment and come to an agreement"" on deficit reduction, Coburn said. ""There doesn't have to be a standoff. What there has to be is real leadership and recognizing the serious nature and the urgency of our problem."" He rejected criticism by fellow conservatives for supporting the deficit reduction plan of the bipartisan commission, which included increased tax revenue rejected by many on the political right. ""I'm not in the Senate for the Republican Party,"" said Coburn, who won re-election last month for his second and what he insisted would be his final six-year term. ""I'm in the Senate for America and for the future of our country. And if we are going to measure everything by Republican/Democrat, we're going to continue down this course that is going to result in our failure."" Jarrett indicated Obama sought a middle road, noting he had shown his willingness to work with Republicans but also would ""fight very hard"" for eventually ending the lower tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. Throughout his presidency, she noted, Obama had taken necessary steps -- ""some of them unpopular"" -- to deal with the financial crisis he faced on taking office and now to reach the tax compromise. ""What he realizes is that he had to be pragmatic, but he was being pragmatic in order to deliver for the American people,"" Jarrett said, later adding: ""The American people expect him to lead. He is their president. He is everybody's president, regardless of party affiliation."" CNN's Gabriella Schwarz contributed to this story.","Next week brings the first split Congress since 2004 .

"(CNN) -- A day after reports that Samsung plans to announce a follow up to its popular Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone in February, the Korean company has taken to Twitter to deny them. The Samsung Galaxy S4, a new iteration of the phone that has established itself as the chief rival to Apple's iPhone, will be introduced in February at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, according to The Korea Times. A day after that report surfaced, though, Samsung took to its Korean Twitter account to deny it. ""Please note that some media reported speculation that the Galaxy S's subsequent models will be released,"" the tweet read in Korean, calling the report ""a simple rumor [that] is not true."" The report from the Times, the oldest English-language newspaper in South Korea, cites unnamed company officials and parts suppliers in the region. Among the Galaxy S4's features will be a 5-inch screen, slightly larger than the display on the popular Galaxy S III and a full inch bigger than the iPhone 5, the report said. It will have more powerful hardware and software and will ""definitely use"" 4G LTE networks, a parts supplier told the paper. The perils of sleeping with your mobile phone . Phones running Google's Android operating system have been outselling the iPhone for some time. But that's a fragmented field that includes dozens of phones of varying quality. No single handset has established itself as a serious rival to Apple's phone. The Galaxy S III has made perhaps the best claim. Last month, the company announced it had sold more than 20 million units in three months, making September the first month since the release of the iPhone 4S that it wasn't the world's top-selling smartphone. Snap reviews of the iPhone 5 have been somewhat mixed, at least among the tech media. Many who got a hands-on demo at Apple's Wednesday announcement praised its slimmer, lighter design, bigger display and faster processor. Others said the device failed to produce groundbreaking advances at a moment when Apple, perhaps for the first time ever, finds itself needing to catch up with features available on other phones. Customer response, however, has been overwhelming. Pre-orders of the iPhone 5 ""sold out"" almost instantly (an admittedly arbitrary feat considering Apple controls the supply), with orders topping 2 million in the first 24 hours. That's double the 1 million for last year's iPhone 4S in the same time period. The phone hits stores Friday in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom. It rolls out in 22 other countries on September 28. The S4's release would mark Samsung's biggest salvo since a federal court in California ruled that Samsung violated multiple Apple patents in the release of its own products. After the ruling, Apple asked the court to add the Galaxy S III to the list of products that are in violation. The case was just one of roughly 50 patent disputes in different countries. Some of the other courts have ruled in favor of Samsung. According to the South Korean news report, Samsung is working with U.S. carriers on modified designs the company said will eliminate any questions about patents. The report said Samsung plans to fire back in another way, too. Samsung is asking Apple to pay more for the processors it produces at an Austin, Texas, plant and is promoting itself as ""the only firm that can guarantee on-time delivery, output commitment and better pricing for mobile application processors,"" one executive told The Korea Times.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- The head of Nigeria's police has been given 24 hours to produce a terror attack suspect who escaped police custody under suspicious circumstances, a government minister said Thursday. Minister of Police Affairs Navy Capt. Caleb Olubolade said he and Police Inspector General Hafiz Ringim had been summoned to see President Goodluck Jonathan Wednesday over the escape. The fugitive, identified by police as Kabiru Sokoto, is suspected to be the mastermind of a series of deadly church bombings on Christmas Day. The bombings were claimed by Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group frequently blamed for sectarian violence in Nigeria. A 50 million naira ($307,000) reward was offered by police Thursday for any information leading to Sokoto's capture and a photograph of him in custody has been distributed to all police stations in the country. Ringim will face severe sanctions for negligence of duty if Sokoto is not found, Olubolade said in a statement. ""Anyone could be sacked, including myself,"" Olubolade said. The suspect was initially detained successfully, but he escaped when suspected gang members attacked his police escort as he was being transferred to another town, police sources said Wednesday. The sources asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. Olubolade said he had directed that the officers involved in the transfer be immediately detained. The police commissioner responsible for the suspect's secure transfer is currently under arrest, according to police sources. They named the commissioner as Zakaria Biu, who himself hails from Borno state, the hub of Boko Haram's activities. Jonathan declared a partial state of emergency December 31 in four northern states, Borno among them, to contain a wave of attacks by Boko Haram. Police sources also pointed the finger at Boko Haram Wednesday for an attack on a Nigerian army outpost in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno, in which two soldiers were killed.","NEW: A $307,000 reward is put up by police for information leading to the suspect .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- An uneasy calm returned to Nigeria's cities Tuesday, a day after two Nigerian labor groups suspended their nationwide strike over the elimination of the country's fuel subsidy. In suspending the strikes, the Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress cited successes gained by demonstrators, including an announcement Monday by President Goodluck Jonathan slashing fuel prices. In Lagos, the country's commercial center, vehicles filled the streets Tuesday but traffic was still at lower-than-normal levels. A heavy military presence was still evident in the city's streets in the evening, with armed checkpoints set up at most key bridges and along major roads in the city. Many gas stations displayed a price of 97 naira (60 cents) per liter, the new price announced by the government Monday. The protests began earlier this month after fuel that had cost about 65 naira (40 cents) shot up to 141 naira (86 cents) when the subsidy was removed. Announcing the revised price Monday, Jonathan cited ""the hardships being suffered by Nigerians."" And in a signal that the government has listened to public complaints about widespread corruption, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was also tasked Tuesday with investigating fraud over fuel imports and sales. But while the NLC and TUC urged demonstrators to go home as they suspended their industrial action, it remained unclear whether they will accept the fuel-price cut and call for a permanent end to the strikes and protests. A third organization, the Joint Action Front, issued a statement deploring the suspension and urging continued strikes and protests until the government agrees to restore gas prices to what they were before the subsidy ended. In another statement Tuesday, the JAF criticized the inspector general of police, Hafiz Ringim, over his warning that any Nigerians taking part in protests would be arrested and charged, and that anyone calling for a change of government would be prosecuted for treason. JAF Secretary Abiodun Aremu condemned Ringim's statement as ""uncivilized and provocative"" and accused him of seeking to ""repress the legitimate expression and freedom of assembly of Nigerians."" The union said it would consult with the public over continuing the strike action. But there were no protesters to be seen on the streets of Lagos Tuesday, following the warning from Ringim. Police continued to stop and shine lights into vehicles passing through the city, while soldiers equipped with armed personnel carriers were stationed by the so-called ""freedom parks"" where protesters had congregated. Lagos state Gov. Babatunde Fashola called Monday for the immediate withdrawal of soldiers from the streets of Lagos, a sign of dissent among the authorities over the handling of the protests. In a written statement, Fashola said there was no development in the state that warranted such a large military deployment and the protests had been largely peaceful and lawful. ""For me this is not a matter for the military. The sooner we rethink and rescind this decision the better and stronger our democracy will be,"" he said, saying public discourse on political matters should be encouraged. ""If anything, this is a most welcome transformation of our democracy in the sense that it provokes a discussion of economic policies and ... may result in political debate,"" he added. Eyewitnesses told CNN that police and the army were not allowing protesters into demonstration zones Monday, but there were no confirmed reports of violence. Scattered demonstrations began in Nigeria after Jonathan announced on January 1 that the government would end the popular fuel subsidy, which was widely seen by citizens as one of the few perks of living in the oil-rich but largely impoverished nation of more than 160 million people. The government has said the removal of subsidies would free up billions of dollars to boost the economy and improve the country's infrastructure. But there is a widespread lack of trust that the government would provide the infrastructure. The subsidy's removal caused the price of fuel and other goods to spike and became a rallying point for Nigerians angry over corruption and the alleged misuse of oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. Nigeria, the world's eighth-largest crude oil exporter, is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world.","NEW: A heavy military presence is still visible on the streets of Lagos .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to review whether a federal law outlawing the sale of graphic videos of animal cruelty amounts to a violation of free-speech rights. The Supreme Court will hear a case on dogfighting, which usually involves pit bulls, shelter statistics say. The justices accepted the Justice Department appeal of a case dealing with a tape showing pit bull dogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations. A federal appeals court had thrown out the conviction of Robert Stevens, a Virginia man who sold videos through his ""Dogs of Velvet and Steel"" business. According to court records, undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in ""Sporting Dog Journal,"" an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting. Among the products Stevens advertised was ""Catch Dogs,"" featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a ""gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig,"" according to the Philadelphia-based appeals court. Stevens was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty. He was later sentenced to 37 months in prison, and promptly appealed. It was the first prosecution in the United States to proceed to trial under the decade-old law. The divided appeals court concluded that when it came to the federal law in question, ""research and empirical evidence in the record before us simply does not support the notion that banning depictions of animal cruelty is a necessary or even particularly effective means of prosecuting underlying acts of animal cruelty."" The court noted many state and local jurisdictions have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals. The government had argued a ""compelling interest"" in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions. Growing in popularity are what are called ""crush"" videos, in which women, with their faces unseen, are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked-heel shoes or with their bare feet. The case, U.S. v. Stevens, will be argued in the fall.","Supreme Court accepts case dealing with profiting from recording pit bull fights .

"(CNN) -- A Somali appeals court has cleared a woman who accused security forces of raping her but upheld the conviction of a journalist who interviewed her. The judge said that journalist Abdiaziz Abdinur Ibrahim had disrespected the country's law, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a Sunday statement, noting that it was unclear exactly what law he broke. His one-year sentence was cut to six months. ""The court acquitted a woman who should never have been charged while upholding an unjust conviction of a journalist,"" said Daniel Bekele, the group's Africa director. ""After this case, who in their right mind would suggest to a victim of government abuse that they report the crime? Or tell their story to a journalist?"" Both the woman and the journalist were sentenced to one year in prsion by a lower court last month. That court ruled the 27-year-old woman made false rape accusations against security forces during an interview, and in so doing insulted the government. The journalist was found guilty of fabricating a false claim, though he never filed a story, according to rights groups. The alleged rape took place in August. ""The government has argued that justice should run its course in this case, but each step has been justice denied,"" Bekele said. ""Quashing the case and unconditionally releasing Abdiaziz Abdinur will show that this government is ready to focus on protecting freedom of expression and encouraging victims of sexual violence to come forward."" The case has sparked international condemnation, prompting Somalia to launch an independent human rights commission. Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said the commission will investigate. ""Respect for women's rights and media freedom are fundamental to ensuring the development of a strong, stable and vibrant democracy in Somalia,"" the White House said in a statement last month. ""Women should be able to seek justice for rape and other gender-based violence without fear of retribution, and journalists in Somalia must be free to work without being subjected to violence and harassment.""

"New York (CNN) -- Al Qaeda propagandist Sulaiman Abu Ghaith had a long plane ride last week to New York and an American jail cell located blocks from ground zero of the September 11 attacks. He filled that time, in part, by talking to U.S. investigators. It was an odd end to a journey that began just weeks earlier in Iran. Abu Ghaith, for reasons still unclear, left Iran and entered Turkey using a forged Saudi passport, Turkish media reported. The CIA tracked him to a Turkish hotel room. He was detained by Turkish officials in early February, but they refused for a month to turn him over to the U.S. Instead, Turkey expelled Abu Ghaith and put him on a plane to Kuwait, where he was born, sources said. U.S. law enforcement took him into custody during a stopover in Jordan. Members of HIG -- the High Value Interrogation Group, which includes the CIA -- were also involved in the operation. Abu Ghaith apparently wasn't quiet during his overseas flight with U.S. authorities. The conversations, confirmed by a U.S. official with knowledge of them, are expected to be part of the government's case to prove Abu Ghaith helped conspire to kill Americans and recruited members for al Qaeda. The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment on whether or when Abu Ghaith was read his Miranda rights after his arrest. However, intelligence experts say that is required if prosecutors intend to use his lengthy statement during trial. ""That would be the way it was done,"" says Mitchell Silber, an executive managing director with the security firm K2 Intelligence and the New York Police Department's former director of Intelligence analysis. Sources and intelligence experts told CNN it's questionable how helpful Abu Ghaith, one of Osama bin Laden's sons-in-law, could be in terms of current intelligence, because he has been out of the loop for years. He has lived in Iran since 2002, mostly under house arrest. ""He's a low-level target with high political value,"" Silber told CNN. ""His main value would be (if he's) able to help quantify and assess the former top al Qaeda leaders with him under house arrest in Iran,"" Silber says. Silber added the U.S. would want Abu Ghaith to ""describe the nature of the Iranian treatment of them,"" including ""how adversarial the relationship is between Iran and al Qaeda."" There is concern former al Qaeda leaders in Iran could rise to power again. But the relationship between the predominantly Shiite Iranians and the largely Sunni al Qaeda members is a complex one. Just how do the Iranians view al Qaeda? Do they see opportunities for cooperation? Or is the extreme Sunni philosophy of the group too much for them? It's something investigators would like to know, and Abu Ghaith may have insights. Strange bedfellows -- Iran and al Qaeda . On Friday, the fiery former al Qaeda spokesman walked into federal court with his hands cuffed. He was only about a mile from ground zero in the very country he had targeted in multiple video messages, warning Americans they would be attacked again after 9/11 by ""airplane storms"" and biochemical attacks. At his arraignment, his cuffs now removed, a not guilty plea was entered on Abu Ghaith's behalf by Philip Weinstein, the attorney appointed to represent him. Abu Ghaith told the court, through an Arabic interpreter, he had no money to pay for a lawyer. Prosecutors didn't reveal what Abu Ghaith had said to them, only telling the court he had made an ""extensive statement"" after his arrest that filled 22 pages. The charges in the indictment were sealed until his arrest. He is being held without bond until his next appearance in April. No trial date has been set. If found guilty, Abu Ghaith faces life in prison.","Sulaiman Abu Ghaith's statement, given after his arrest, is 22 pages long .

"London (CNN) -- Europe's political and economic attempts to stem the eurozone debt crisis may finally be getting results, Finland's European minister Alexander Stubb has told CNN. Stubb told CNN a combination of political action and monetary intervention in the eurozone over the last month had put Europe on the road to economic recovery. ""If we play our cards right, I think we will have turned the corner of this crisis,"" he said. Earlier this month, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi announced a program to buy bonds of fiscally-frail countries such as Spain and Italy. A week later, the German constitutional court green-lighted the European Stability Mechanism -- the region's 500 billion euro ($651 billion) permanent bailout fund -- to come into force in October this year. A victory for pro-European parties in the Dutch elections this month was also a sign that electorates in Northern European countries have not lost faith in the 17-nation currency bloc. Stubb told CNN Europe was stuck in a ""vicious cycle"" between politicians, the media and the markets, which was hindering the speed of economic recovery. He said the issue was: ""Politicians talking loose stuff, media interpreting that loose stuff and then markets reacting to what the media reports."" Ford boss: Europe's a concern for us all . Stubb said debt-ridden countries like Spain and Italy were taking the necessary steps to reform but reiterated the ECB's message of conditionality in exchange for aid. He added: ""I have a lot of respect for the Spanish government because they have taken a lot of tough decisions in the past few months."" The 44-year-old is in favor of a banking union -- a proposal from Brussels which would give the European Central Bank a supervisory role for more than 6,000 eurozone banks. But, he said, ""we cannot be in a situation where those banks which have taken care of their funds, have a good balance sheet, would be paying for those banks which haven't done so well."" UniCredit head: We need a European banking union . Stubb's comments follow his speech to The Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin, Ireland, in which he was skeptical over calls for a more integrated Europe. Of such an idea, he said: ""We do not have the time, nor can we introduce an element of further uncertainty."" Such a stance runs contrary to that of European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who told CNN Europe needed to be more unified.","Finland's European Minister Alexander Stubb tells CNN Europe's debt crisis may be abating .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- An autopsy on the body of Donda West, mother of hip-hop mogul Kanye West, was inconclusive pending the results of toxicology tests, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner said Tuesday. Ed Winter said preliminary reports indicated that West, 58, may have died from complications from cosmetic surgery. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Jan Adams said he performed cosmetic surgery on her Friday at a surgical center. West died Saturday evening after she was found unresponsive and in respiratory distress at her home, Winter said. ""She was taken to Centinela Freeman Regional Medical Center in Marina del Rey,"" he said. ""Efforts to preserve her life were unsuccessful. She was pronounced dead at 8:28 p.m."" A funeral for West is scheduled for November 20, a representative for Kanye West said.  Watch latest on the death of Donda West » . Adams told TMZ.com that he performed a tummy tuck and breast reduction on West last week and that her death was unforeseen. But another Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon said he had recently refused to perform a procedure on West until she had a medical clearance for a condition he feared could lead to a heart attack. ""The preliminary information we had indicated that she had several minor medical issues,"" Winter said, ""but I can't comment on those."" He also said she was taking medications, but could not comment on which ones and in what dosages pending the toxicology reports. Winter also said West was in good condition before the surgery and that investigators are talking with Adams about the surgery. He did not say when the results of the toxicology tests would be available. Adams told TMZ.com that West's death could have been caused by a heart attack, pulmonary embolism or massive vomiting. He said he consulted with her for months and she changed her mind several times about going forward with the surgery, TMZ.com said. TMZ.com, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner. Adams later released a statement through his publicist expressing his ""deepest condolences to the West family at a very difficult time"" but declined further comment. ""As a medical doctor practicing in this field, I hold sacred the bond of confidentiality that exists between a patient and doctor,"" he said. ""Out of respect for the West family and in the absence of other verifiable information, any comment from me without first discussing that information with the family would be unprofessional."" Adams is the television host of Discovery Health's ""Plastic Surgery: Before and After."" According to his biography on Discovery.com -- which has been removed from the Web site -- Adams is also the author of ""Everything Women of Color Should Know About Cosmetic Surgery."" He graduated from Harvard University, attended Ohio State University College of Medicine and studied plastic surgery at the University of Michigan. On Monday, Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon Andre Aboolian said through his publicist that Donda West consulted him in June about a procedure. Publicist Jo-Ann Geffen said West contacted Aboolian again two weeks ago to say she was ready to go forward, but Aboolian said he needed a medical clearance before he would perform the surgery. ""I always insist on a medical clearance for women over 40, and in this instance it was particularly important because of a condition she had that I felt could have led to a heart attack,"" Aboolian said, according to Geffen's statement. Geffen said West was scheduled to see an internist for the appropriate tests, but did not keep the appointment. Donda West was a major influence on her son's life, as the music producer-singer-songwriter has often said -- including in lyrics to some of his songs. She regularly attended her son's concerts, and was at his performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September. Earlier this year, she released a book she co-authored called ""Raising Kanye: Life Lessons From the Mother of a Hip-Hop Superstar."" West retired from her post as professor and chair of the English Department at Chicago State University in 2004 to become her son's manager, according to the Kanye West Foundation Web site. She also became CEO of Super Good, the parent company of Kanye West Enterprises. In Kanye West's song ""Can't Tell Me Nothing,"" a track from his latest album, ""Graduation,"" he rhymes about her attempt to discourage him from spending money on jewelry. On ""Touch the Sky,"" from his 2005 album, ""Late Registration,"" he recalls how his mother drove him from Chicago to New York in a U-Haul van. Donda West was also the inspiration for the song ""Hey Mama."" A statement issued late Monday from ""Kanye West, his family and friends"" thanked ""everyone for the outpouring of support"" and asked that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Kanye West Foundation, which Donda West co-founded with her son. West, who is in Europe preparing for a tour of the continent, will remain overseas until next week, when he will return for the funeral, the representative said. The tour has been postponed.

"(CNN) -- At least three people died when a suicide bomb exploded near Afghanistan's Kandahar airfield Thursday, hours after U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had left the city. One American was killed and three others were wounded, Panetta said. Two Afghan civilians were killed and 18 others were wounded, said Jawid Faisal, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar province, in the country's violent southern region. The attack struck an MRAP, the acronym for a Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle used by U.S. forces, as it was about to enter the base. The Taliban claimed responsibility, the group's spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said in an e-mail CNN obtained. He wrote that a ""brave Taliban fighter"" carried out the attack. The e-mail did not specify whether the explosion was connected to Panetta's visit. Who are the Pakistani Taliban? The defense secretary's delegation was never in danger, said a U.S. official traveling with Panetta. The bomb went off about 5 p.m. local time and targeted ""a foreign forces convoy."" Coalition spokesman Lt. Col. Hagen Messer confirmed the bombing, saying International Security Assistance Force investigators were at the scene. ""I don't know at this point if this was in any way linked to our visit,"" said the U.S. official traveling with Panetta. Pentagon press secretary George Little confirmed that the explosion from was a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, a term used for a car bomb. President Barack Obama and Panetta invited Afghan President Harmid Karzai to visit Washington early next year to discuss the volatile security situation. Panetta said Karzai appeared willing to visit but didn't say whether the president accepted the invitation. Panetta made the comments after meeting with Karzai in Kabul, and a U.S. official released a formal statement about that possible visit, which may come in January. What does the future hold for Afghanistan? Karzai and Obama ""look forward to discussing a shared vision of Afghanistan beyond 2014,"" the statement read. The meeting will be an important opportunity to discuss implementation of the strategic partnership signed by the two leaders about U.S. military presence in the country, it explained. ""As we consider our post-2014 military and civilian presence, it is important that we work closely with President Karzai to understand his views about how we can best support his country while we pursue our core objectives and responsibly wind down the war,"" the statement said. ""As (President Obama) has already made clear, any U.S. presence would only be at the invitation of the Afghan government and aimed at training Afghan Forces and targeting the remnants of al-Qaeda.""","One American, two Afghans died in attack near airfield .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A U.S. envoy expressed optimism that food aid would find its way to those in need in North Korea after two days of talks with officials from Pyongyang, but it remained unclear when the shipments might begin. Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, met with North Korean representatives in Beijing to thrash out the details of a plan to allow the resumption of food aid to the North. ""We resolved the administrative issues that we were concerned with,"" King said Thursday before leaving for Washington to report the results of the discussions. He described the meetings as ""very productive, positive talks."" He added, though, that the timing of the food deliveries was not yet clear. ""We're still working on the details,"" he said. ""Not all of those questions have been worked out."" North Korea last week announced an agreement to freeze its nuclear and missile tests, along with uranium enrichment programs, and allow the return of U.N. nuclear inspectors. The United States said it would provide 240,000 metric tons of nutritional assistance to the impoverished country. The United States had suspended shipments of food aid to North Korea in 2009 amid tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear program and concerns that the supplies were not reaching those most in need. The initial deal last week to resume the deliveries came after the the two countries revived negotiations that had stalled after the death in December of the longtime North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. The talks this week were held in order to finalize points like what ports will be used to dock incoming ships, how the distribution of the food will be monitored and which nongovernmental organizations will be involved. The agreement last week was cautiously welcomed by U.S. officials in the hope that a new era in relations with the North would begin and lead to a resumption of multilateral talks aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But Pyongyang has stepped up its rhetoric against the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, and his government since Kim Jong Un took over from his father, Kim Jong Il, as North Korean leader. Earlier this week, North Korean television aired footage of a military unit carrying out live-fire drills in sight of a South Korean island. It showed tanks repositioning and an artillery machine being prepared, overlooking waters that have seen a number of violent incidents over the years. North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island in November 2010, killing four South Koreans, claiming it was responding to a South Korean military drill in the area. Li Gum-chol, a North Korean deputy commander, said: ""We will turn Seoul into a sea of flames by our strong and cruel artillery firepower, which cannot be compared to our artillery shelling on Yeonpyeong Island. We are training hard, concentrating on revenge to shock Lee Myung-bak's traitorous group and the military warmongers in South Korea."" The United States and South Korea are carrying out annual joint military drills, which North Korea has condemned as a provocation. Now, Pyongyang is staging its own.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya's founding leader, narrowly won the presidential poll despite facing charges of crimes against humanity over election violence five years ago. Kenyatta clinched 50.07% of the vote, the election commission announced Saturday, barely breaking past the halfway mark. His main rival, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, got 43.31% of the vote, and said he will challenge the outcome in court. The constitution requires a 50% plus one vote for an outright win. His victory puts the West in a quandary. Kenyatta is facing trial at the International Criminal Court over post-election violence that plunged the nation into chaos in 2007. Shortly after election officials announced the results, he thanked citizens for bestowing him the leadership role and vowed to work for everyone. ""We celebrate the triumph of democracy; the triumph of peace; the triumph of nationhood,"" Kenyatta said. ""Despite the misgivings of many in the world, we demonstrated a level of political maturity that surpassed expectations."" Winning parties should remain ""modest in victory,"" he said, acknowledging that nearly half the nation did not vote for him. Jubilant supporters took to the streets, speeding down crowded streets, honking and chanting his name. ""This is a new dawn, our leader has been elected,"" said John Kamau, a Nakuru resident. 'It is frustrating' For some of Odinga's strongholds, the mood was tense but calm. ""Our man has tried to be president three times, it is frustrating,"" said James Ouma, who lives in the capital of Nairobi. ""We will accept it. What can we do? Life must go on."" Odinga said the election outcome is flawed. ""We are confident that the court will restore the faith of Kenyans in the democratic role,"" he said. Despite the looming challenge, Kenyatta struck a conciliatory note after the close election, applauding Odinga for a ""spirited campaign,"" ""I know that all the candidates have made tremendous personal sacrifices .. and I welcome them to join us in moving our nation forward,"" he said. A vital ally . The vote's significance extends far beyond Kenyan borders. Kenya is East Africa's biggest economy and a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent. It provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling Somali government and the politically tense Sudan and South Sudan. Most importantly -- at least to the West -- Kenya is a major U.S. ally in the war against Islamist militants in the region and has remained relatively peaceful amid civil wars in neighboring nations. Complicated relations . Kenyatta's victory raised the prospect of complicated diplomatic ties with the West. The International Criminal Court indicted him for allegedly funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks in the last election in 2007. His running mate, William Ruto, also faces ICC charges at The Hague. Both have denied the charges and have said they will cooperate with the court to clear their names. The assurance has not allayed fears among some Western diplomats. Before the election, Johnnie Carson, the State Department's top diplomat for Africa, issued a stern warning, saying Kenyans can pick their own leaders, but ""choices have consequences."" But in a statement after the election, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry applauded the vote. ""Kenya has been one of America's strongest and most enduring partners in Africa,"" Kerry said. ""We ... will continue to be a strong friend and ally of the Kenyan people."" The UK minister for Africa, Marks Simmonds, echoed his sentiment and called on candidates to address disputes in court to avoid violence. Kenyatta has said the indictment will not affect his ability to do his job and urged the international community to respect the will of Kenyans. ""I have been a member of the government, and I've still been able to execute my duties,"" said Kenyatta, a deputy prime minister in the outgoing administration. ""I still believe I will be able to execute my duties as president."" Carson's predecessor, Jendayi Frazer, said she does not foresee much change in ties between Kenya and the United States. ""Kenyatta knows that he needs the United States, and the United States knows it needs Kenya,"" she said. ""And so I suspect that while it might be awkward, there won't be a significant change in our policy stances toward Kenya or theirs toward us."" No faith in the ICC . Analysts say the ICC indictment may have rallied citizens to Kenyatta's side in defiance of the West. ""Many Africans have lost faith in ICC and view it as targeting African leaders and failing to discharge its justice among non-African leaders,"" said Ayo Johnson, director of ViewPoint Africa. ""Kenya sent a loud message to the ICC ... don't interfere. And it does not matter if you brand our leaders as criminals."" The president-elect's trial is scheduled for July while his running mate's is in May. Kenya is the second African nation after Sudan to have a sitting president facing charges at the International Criminal Court. Eager to avoid a repeat . In a nation with fierce ethnic loyalties, Kenyans were eager to avoid a repeat of the last election. At the time, the nation plunged into ethnic violence after Odinga disputed results that declared the incumbent president, Mwai Kibaki, as the winner, alleging the election had been rigged. Ethnic groups loyal to each side took to the streets, where supporters of both camps fought one another. More than 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. But despite the divisive vote this year, some citizens said it is time to move forward. ""The people have spoken, even though my voice was not one of them,"" said Jane Nduku, a Nairobi resident. Kenyatta's win at age 51 makes him the nation's youngest president. CNN's Nima Elbagir reported from Nairobi, and Faith Karimi from Atlanta. CNN's Lillian Leposo contributed to this report.","NEW: We demonstrated a level of political maturity that surpassed expectations,"" Kenyatta says .

"Qaqoortoq, Greenland (CNN) -- Greenland is an autonomous territory that is partially administered by Denmark. The police force and military in Greenland are Danish and Greenland sends three members to the Danish parliament. It is the largest Island in the world and was discovered around 982 by an explorer named Eric the Red who had been exiled from Iceland for murder for three years. That is significant because Eric the Red sailed to Greenland in a small wooden boat, but nowadays the area around Greenland is covered all year with pack ice and icebergs. It would have been impossible for him to penetrate the ice fields around Greenland with the vessels of the day. So many researchers have come to the conclusion that temperatures in Greenland must have been much higher in the 10th century than they are today. Also, the fact that he named the territory ""Greenland"" seems to indicate a more lush landscape than the barren plains and mountains one can see now. Scientists have long known that the earth's temperatures have gone up and down in various climate cycles in our planet's long history and weather pattern have changed with them. Greenland was once billed as promising farming territory and now that our planet is warming up once again, agriculture is returning. It might seem strange that the people of Greenland, those who are witnessing global warming up close, are not too unhappy about it. Until you visit the Greenland's Agricultural Advisory Service in Qaqoortoq, southern Greenland, close to where Erik the Red started his first settlement more than 1,000 years ago. Anne Jensen is an agricultural adviser here and she is frank about what the temperature changes mean to Greenlanders. ""Of course the warmer it gets the better the conditions are for farming,"" she said while inspecting a green house. ""There is a lot of potential for farming in Greenland. We have such vast expanses the main issue here is really building irrigation systems."" Until a few years ago farming was difficult in Greenland because the temperatures simply did not remain warm long enough for crops to blossom. But now things are changing. Greenlandic potatoes, cabbage, and a variety of herbs have become common in supermarkets on the island. And during CNN's visit to the institute Anne Jensen showed our crew the latest crop the gardeners here were experimenting with: strawberries, grown just South of the Arctic Circle. ""We are testing to see whether they will survive the harsh winter here,"" Jensen said inspecting the plants. Many were showing signs of new light green leaves springing from the stems. ""We can see there are new leaves and that seems to indicate that they have survived the winter. It might not be uncommon in the future to see strawberries from Greenland in shops."" But for now it is still a trial and Anne Jensen, like most Greenlanders, goes to great lengths to show that the people who live here do not want to get wealthy on the heels of global warming. ""It is not all good,"" Jensen explained. ""The past summer was very warm, but it doesn't just get hotter, the climate patterns change as well and we had a pretty severe drought here which led to very bad crops for many farmers."" Still, rising temperatures offer a lot of potential that Greenland is trying to tap into, hoping that farming will prevail here if the infrastructure, like watering systems, is in place. In addition, the receding glaciers also mean that there will be more land will be available for commercial use. Besides farming, an abundance of natural resources are also coming to light and prospecting companies are already busy, hoping for a bonanza. Flying over parts of Greenland it is easy to see exploratory mines and many firms are already in talks with Greenland's government in hopes of exploiting everything from coal to iron, gold, diamonds, and even uranium. Some believe Greenland could because the next Kazakhstan referring to that countries abundance of natural resources. The branch of agriculture with the longest tradition by far is sheep herding. CNN's crew visited the biggest sheep farm in Southern Greenland with about 800 animals during lambing season, when baby sheep are born every few minutes. The land belongs to Aqalooraq Frederiksen, a third generation farmer, who says his business is getting better with rising temperatures. ""It used to be very hard to find enough grazing land here in Greenland because grass just didn't grow here,"" Frederiksen said while inspecting the new lambs. ""Now it is getting better. In fact we could have even more sheep in Greenland. Right now, there are about 20,000 in all of Greenland, but we could easily have 40,000 with the grazing land that is now available."" The main problem for the growth of this industry is logistics, Frederiksen said: ""There are only fifty thousand people in all of Greenland and this place is massive. It is really hard to get our products to markets in the capital Nuuk. That is an hour-and-a-half flight away and there is no road. In the winters all the waterways are frozen. ""The same is true for animal feed. We can't make enough for the winter here so we have to import everything from Denmark, which is very expensive."" Still, Frederiksen believes in the long run these problems can be worked out and sheep farming will continue to grow along with cattle and reindeer farming, both of which are still in their infancy. Global warming may very well be a threat to humanity, but here in Greenland it seems to be pushing this country back to what it was when it was discovered by the traveler Erik the Red. A lush, green piece of land that could offer good conditions for agriculture.","Temperatures in Greenland thought to have been higher during the 10th century when discovered by Eric the Red .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that North Korea's new leader, Kim Jung Un, ""has a choice to make"" -- become a ""transformative leader"" or continue the Communist nation's existing policies, which she predicted would lead to its demise. ""He can continue the model of the past and eventually North Korea will change, because at some point people cannot live under such oppressive conditions -- starving to death, being put into gulags and having their basic human rights denied,"" she said. ""We are hoping that he will chart a different course for his people."" The 29-year-old Kim Jong Un became North Korea's most powerful figure about six months ago, following the death of his father Kim Jong Il. He has only made two public speeches since rising to power -- the first coming at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's founder and his grandfather Kim Il Sung, and more recently in June in a speech to about 20,000 children. Referring to Kim Jong Un, Clinton expressed ""hope that the new leadership in Pyongyang will live up to its agreements, will not engage in threats and provocations (and) will put the North Korean people first."" ""Rather than spending money on implements of war, feed your people, provide education and health care, and lift your people out of poverty and isolation,"" she advised North Korea's new leader. The comments followed a meeting in Washington -- referred to by both sides as the ""2-plus-2"" talks -- involving Clinton, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and South Korea's foreign and defense ministers. Afterward, the United States and South Korea released a joint statement reaffirming their cooperation on security matters, an alliance they called ""a linchpin of stability, security, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and increasingly around the world."" That cooperation was evident in crisis management and ""intelligence sharing"" before, during and after North Korea's failed long-range rocket launch in April, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin said Thursday. Some expressed concerns that launch, which the U.N. Security Council condemned as a ""serious violation"" of previous council resolutions, might signal Pyongyang's intentions to fire nuclear weapons on its foes. Foreign Minister Kim Sung Hwan promised that South Korea and the United States ""will show a decisive response"" if North Korea moves to ""provoke again."" Yet he also opened the door for talks. ""The road to dialogue and cooperation is open should North Korea stop its provocation,"" he said. A few years after the Korean peninsula was divided after World War II, U.S. forces joined South Korea in the Korean War -- a conflict that ended in a cease-fire, but no peace treaty. North Korea's nuclear weapons capabilities have further heightened tensions in recent years. This week's meeting in Washington showed the strength of the partnership between two of North Korea's staunchest foes. In addition to a continued focus on Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, the two parties announced a joint defense initiative focused on ""evolving threats, such as in space, the maritime domain, and cyberspace,"" according to the joint statement. ""Working together, we can improve the security of our government, military and commercial infrastructure and better protect against cyber attacks,"" Clinton said.","NEW: ""Rather than spending money on implements of war, feed your people,"" Clinton says .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Representatives of South Korea, Japan and the United States will meet ""in the near future"" to discuss North Korea, a U.S. State Department official told reporters Friday in Tokyo at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""I think we've agreed that we'll be holding a meeting in the near future,"" said Kurt M. Campbell, assistant secretary, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, according to a transcript of his remarks on the State Department website. ""I think the exact date, we are still coordinating among our partners."" Campbell is on a trip through Asia that comes after the death last month of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and his replacement at the country's helm by his son Kim Jong Un. Relations on the Korean peninsula have been tense since Kim's death fueled doubts about the secretive regime's stability and future direction. On Thursday, South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-Hwan said his country is ""open to dialogue"" with the new North Korean leadership, despite harsh recent comments from Pyongyang. Kim told reporters not to read too much into North Korea's recent statement that it would never negotiate with the ""Lee Myung Bak group of traitors,"" a reference to the South Korean president. Kim said he did not know how much influence Kim Jong Un had in his own country, underlining once again how little is known about the new North Korean leader. The United States currently has about 28,500 military personnel stationed in South Korea, which North Korea claims is the main impediment to reunification of the Korean people. The United States fought on the side of the South during the 1950-53 war and keeps troops in country as a deterrent against the North.","Talks to be held 'in the near future,' State Department official says .

"(CNN) -- Kim Jong Un has assumed ""the supreme commandership"" of the North Korean army, state media reported Saturday. The power was transferred to him on October 8 at the behest of his father, Kim Jong Il, who died this month, said the state-run Korean Central News Agency. The announcement came a day after prospects for a shift in relations on the Korean peninsula were dashed when North Korea said a change in leadership would not mean a change in policy. ""We solemnly declare with confidence that the South Korean puppets and foolish politicians around the world should not expect any change"" from North Korea, the country's National Defense Commission said in a statement reported by KCNA. That statement came after two days of elaborate ceremonies in Pyongyang that honored Kim Jong Il and underlined the rise of his son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un, to the position of ""supreme leader"" of the secretive state. The nuclear-armed North ""will have no dealings with the Lee Myung-bak group of traitors forever,"" the statement said in an English-language version of the KCNA report. Lee is the South Korean president. South Korea's Unification Ministry expressed disappointment. ""The ministry finds today's statement regretful,"" it said. ""However, the ministry's basic principle towards easing tensions in inter-Korean relations and resolving problems through dialogues remains still. The ministry hopes North Korea to regain stability in the near future and present constructive attitude."" The North criticized the South Korean government's decision to allow only a select group of private citizens to visit Pyongyang to pay their respects to Kim Jong Il, whose death was announced last week. Lee's government's ""show of enmity"" toward North Korea ""culminated in its act of blocking south Koreans who wanted to visit Pyongyang to mourn the demise of leader Kim Jong Il,"" the statement said. Seoul allowed a group of South Koreans, including a former first lady and a leading businesswoman, to travel to the North earlier this week to express condolences over Kim Jong Il's death. That move, along with a number of other gestures like expressing condolences to the North Korean people, suggested a slight softening in Lee's government's hardline stance toward Pyongyang. The North, though, did not appear to be impressed by those efforts, expressing anger Friday that more South Koreans weren't permitted to visit Pyongyang and that groups were allowed this week to release leaflets near the border criticizing North Korean leaders. It also said that the South's decision to put its military on alert after Kim Jong Il's death created ""a war-like atmosphere on the ground and in the seas and air."" In one of the more vehement passages of saber-rattling rhetoric, the defense commission warned of revenge over these perceived misdeeds. ""The veritable sea of tears shed by the army and people"" of North Korea ""will turn into that of retaliatory fire to burn all the group of traitors to the last one and their wailing into a roar of revenge to smash the stronghold of the puppet forces,"" the statement said. Amid concerns over change in North Korean leadership, a top U.S. diplomat plans to travel to the region early next year in the first such talks since Kim Jong Il's death, the State Department announced Thursday. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell will ""discuss a range of important bilateral, regional and global issues"" during his four days in China, South Korea and Japan. The State Department statement specifically mentioned that the ""latest developments related to North Korea"" will be on the agenda.","NEW: Power reportedly transferred to him in October .

"Narsarsuaq, Greenland (CNN) -- Every year, we hear stories of global warming advancing and the effects that has on the earth's climate patterns. One phenomenon that is often used to illustrate ice melt in the Arctic is giant icebergs, often the size of whole towns or even small countries, breaking off the ice shield and drifting south. In reality, icebergs constantly break off both the arctic ice shield and Greenland's inland glaciers, a process that scientists call calving. To find out whether that process is accelerating a CNN crew traveled to southern Greenland, to the small village Narsarsuaq, where the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) keep a unique unit of experts. They are called the Ice Patrol and the unit consists of ship navigators and pilots who fly across the south of this vast island to monitor the movement of icebergs, to prevent collisions with cargo ships navigating in the waters around Greenland. ""We keep an eye out for icebergs that are bunched together in narrow waterways,"" said ice observer Jane Robertson on an airborne mission around the southern tip of Greenland. While big icebergs can pose a threat to vessels going through here, surprisingly it is smaller ice pieces that are even more dangerous. ""The smaller icebergs are much harder to detect,"" Robertson said as she was surveying the ice with her binoculars, ""especially if the icebergs have been traveling in the water a long time they become almost colorless and nearly invisible in the ocean."" Flying over the majestic landscapes of this part of Greenland, observers see a huge amount of icebergs, some almost the size of aircraft carriers and several stories tall, others shaped in a distinctive blue coloring because the air has been pressed out of the ice in its glacial journey. Some experts believe that the glaciers in Greenland are calving at a higher rate as temperatures rise, but the ice observers say their observations are not long term enough to speak of a general trend. ""In the past two years there have been more icebergs here,"" Robertson says, ""but then again in the years before there were a lot fewer so it really varies from year to years."" However, other observers point to the fact that Greenland's glaciers have been receding for years, pointing to increased ice melt in the polar region. But even on fairly clear days it takes an experienced captain to navigate a ship through the waters around Greenland. Robertson is also an officer on the Royal Arctic Line, Greenland's own shipping company and says it takes years to understand the challenges involved sailing in Greenland. ""When you encounter masses of icebergs you can either try and go through it or you can go around it,"" Robertson said. ""In most cases the captain will usually try and go around it if he can because no matter how slow you go and how careful you are there will always be damage to the ship and then the weather can get much worse very quickly and you don't want to be in a field of icebergs if it does."" Her experience as a ship's navigator make her so valuable as an ice observer for the DMI, but the everyone in the crew needs to be at the top of their game. Karsten Andsbjerg pilots the helicopter through the fjords and hills in this extremely rugged terrain. A difficult task as he often deals with severe weather while having to make the ride smooth enough for the observers to do their job. ""Yeah, there are some pretty heavy and gusty winds here,"" Andsbjerg said shortly after landing at a Danish weather outpost right at the southern tip of Greenland. ""The other thing is that the weather changes so quickly here, you always have to call ahead to all the airfields and weather stations and keep yourself updated. Otherwise you can be in severe weather in no time."" The observers fly missions three times a week if the weather permits. Afterward they file reports on the location of dangerous ice clusters with photos that show vessels what they are in four if they try to get through. The Ice Patrol's reports are vital and may have already saved lives. The unit was founded after a ship sank off the coast of Greenland in 1959, killing all crew and passengers on board. The MS Hans Hedtoft disaster is known as the ""Greenlandic Titanic"" in this part of the world. Eydun Simonsen, the chief ice observer during CNN's stay with the unit said: ""Just like the Titanic, it was her maiden voyage. To this day we don't know exactly what happened, but we do know that she hit an ice berg and sank with all souls on board. She did manage to send an SOS and later some rescue equipment was recovered."" There hasn't been a major incident in the waters off Greenland since the ice patrol was founded. Better satellite images and more advanced ships will also have played a role in this improved track record, but there is no doubt that captains navigating the cold and often treacherous water of the Arctic value the detailed and up to date information the observers provide.","CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins Danish meteorologists as they chart the passage of Greenland icebergs .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea said Tuesday that it would release an unspecified number of prisoners in February to mark the birthdays of the two dictators who ruled the reclusive nation for a total of more than 60 years. The amnesty of ""convicts,"" ordered by a parliamentary decree, will begin February 1, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. KCNA said the move ties in with the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the revered founder of North Korea who ran the country between 1945 and 1994, and the 70th birthday of his son, Kim Jong Il, who succeeded him and remained in power until his death last month. Leadership of the repressive regime has now passed to a third generation of the Kim family: Kim Jong Un, the youngest son and chosen successor of Kim Jong Il. North Korea tends to grant amnesties to prisoners at five-year intervals after an important date, like the founding of the Korean Workers' Party, according to Park In-ho, the president of Daily NK, an internet news company that monitors developments in North Korea from Seoul. But the centennial of Kim Il Sung's birthday, for which huge commemorations are expected, could result in a particularly large release of prisoners, Park said. In any year, Kim Il Sung's birthday on April 15, known as the ""Day of the Sun,"" is one of the biggest dates in the North Korean calendar. His 100th birthday, combined with the 70th anniversary of the birth of Kim Jong Il on February 16, is likely to considerably intensify the regime's commemorative efforts. But Park cautioned that whatever the scale of this year's amnesty, which is unlikely to include a high proportion of political prisoners, he does not think it will represent an improvement in North Korea's human rights record. ""We have had heard that usually within three months, large numbers of other people get hauled into the prison camps again,"" he said. ""So in the long run, the country maintains almost the same number of prisoners consistently, aside from the one or two months immediately after the amnesty order."" Gauging the number of people detained by North Korea is difficult because of the regime's secretiveness and restrictions on foreign agencies operating there. International organizations estimate that North Korea holds about 200,000 political prisoners. Park said that he believed the overall prison population to be between 300,000 and 400,000. North Korea is estimated to have a total population of about 23 million people. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","The prisoner amnesty ties in with the birthdays of two dead North Korean dictators .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility Thursday for a series of bombings a day earlier that left dozens dead, primarily Shiite Muslims gathering for a revered religious mourning period. At least 31 people were killed and 68 wounded in the blasts Wednesday that came amid heightened security over the Shiite observance, which has been targeted in recent years by extremists.

At least 23 people were killed and 35 wounded in the explosion, he said. Pakistan Taliban spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan claimed responsibility for the attacks in Rawalpindi, Karachi and Shangla. In Karachi, at least two were killed and one wounded in a double-bombing that targeted a Shiite community center, a police official said. Read more: Read more: Who are the Pakistani Taliban?

At least five people were killed and 28 wounded when a bomb detonated in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood, said Wazir Khan Nasar, a police official. Ihsan said the Pakistan Taliban targeted Shiites taking part in mourning observances because they believe it denigrates the Prophet Mohammed. The Taliban attacks came during the holy month of Muharram, which culminates Saturday with the height of the mourning period. The Shiite observance commemorates the death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, who was killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. The battle and subsequent death of Imam Hussein caused the split between Shiite and Sunni Muslims.","At least 31 people are killed in bomb blasts across Pakistan, police say .

"(CNN) -- Albert Einstein once said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Following a third exploratory round of bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea held in Beijing last week, Washington looks as though it is walking into yet another goodies-for-nuclear freeze deal with the reclusive North Koreans. The State Department announced Wednesday that the United States would provide food aid to North Korea in return for Pyongyang's promise to implement a moratorium on long-range missile launches, nuclear tests and its plutonium and uranium enrichment activities. North Korea also agreed to allow the return of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify and monitor the moratorium. Einstein, if he cared about the issue, would probably roll over in his grave. Why are we doing this? We have seen this playbook several times before in our 25-plus year history of trying to denuclearize North Korea. The United States gets pulled into providing food or energy indefinitely to maintain the nuclear freeze. The North Koreans eventually cheat on the freeze and undertake augmentation of their nuclear weapons at other undisclosed facilities. We stop providing the assistance. A hair-raising crisis ensues that is ultimately resolved through another assistance-for-freeze agreement. Wash, rinse, repeat. Political types might condemn it as insanity, naivetÃ© or both. But there may be some common-sensical reasons for doing this. Practically speaking, the achievement of a nuclear and missile-testing moratorium, as well as the reintroduction of the U.N. nuclear-watchdog agency inspectors into Yongbyon, is a useful step. The uranium enrichment program currently meets the definition of a runaway nuclear program. It has gone unabated now for at least five years, if not longer. Getting eyes on the ground again, as in 1994 to 2002 and 2007 to 2008, is a welcome development. For North Korea, the young Kim Jong Un may want to demonstrate a continuity of leadership after the sudden death of his father nine weeks ago, and the regime wants food in preparation for its April 15 celebrations of the 100th birthday of the first leader of North Korea, Kim Il Sung. However, beyond these tactical solutions are longer-term strategic challenges. First, North Korea may temporarily halt their program, but the grim reality is that it will not part with it. Second, the IAEA inspectors will go into the facilities without a supporting U.N. Security Council resolution declaring that the uranium program is in violation of standing denuclearization agreements. (China opposed this.) So while the United States will see this move as monitoring a freeze, North Korea will see it as validating to the international community that it only has peaceful intentions with its uranium program. Third, it is too soon to tell whether this agreement means the junior Kim is turning over a new leaf and seeking to make nice with the world. Fourth, the slightest opening up of this brittle dictatorship under the untested son will ensure that it comes crumbling down -- something for which the United States, China and South Korea are wholly unprepared. Fifth, a nuclear freeze is a long way from the denuclearization objectives sought in the 2005 agreement at the so-called Six-Party Talks. Indeed, one of the unmet U.S. ""pre-steps"" for returning to the Six-Party Talks was a commitment by the North to refrain from further provocations such as the 2010 submarining of a South Korean navy ship and artillery shelling of a South Korean island. The North made no such commitments outside of a vague reference to supporting the 1953 armistice agreement that ceased Korean War hostilities. Finally, nongovermental and humanitarian groups probably chafe at the explicit linking of food assistance to the nuclear freeze. The United States would claim that the North insisted on the linkage. But it takes two to tango. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton correctly characterized the agreement as a ""modest step forward."" This may not be insanity, but it is distasteful given the nature of the regime, its human rights violations and its blatant willingness to engage in renegade nuclear activities. Unfortunately, that's the price one pays when negotiating with North Korea. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Victor Cha, Ellen Kim and Marie DuMond.","The U.S. and North Korea reach new deal on nuclear moratorium .

"(CNN) -- Senate Democrats and the White House failed to find 60 votes to end debate on a $14 billion auto bailout bill and bring it to a vote Thursday night, killing the measure for the year. Sen. Tom Coburn, center, and other Republican senators raised objections to the auto bailout plan Wednesday. The 52-35 vote followed the collapse of negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans seeking a compromise. ""We have worked and worked and we can spend all night tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday, and we're not going to get to the finish line,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor before the vote. ""That's just the way it is. There's too much difference between the two sides."" Reid acknowledged the bill would not survive the procedural vote. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the sticking point was the United Auto Workers' refusal to set a ""date certain"" to put employees at U.S. auto manufacturers at ""parity pay"" with U.S. employees at foreign automakers in the United States. Currently, analysts estimate the union workers at U.S. automakers make about $3 to $4 per hour more than the non-union U.S. employees of foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda, according to the Center for Automotive Research.  Watch the market ramifications of the bailout failure » . The House easily passed the bailout bill earlier this week, but it quickly ran into trouble in the Senate, where Republicans objected to several provisions. Negotiations Thursday involved a compromise proposal put forward by Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, but the senators could not reach agreement. The collapse of negotiations could possibly doom General Motors to a bankruptcy and closure in the coming weeks, with Chrysler potentially following close behind. While Ford Motor has more cash on hand to avoid an immediate crisis, its production could be disrupted by problems in the supplier base, as could the production of overseas automakers with U.S. plants such as Toyota Motor and Honda Motor.  Watch how the automakers crisis has a ripple effect on Asia » . The struggling automakers may get some money anyway. As part of their effort to urge skeptical Republicans to back the deal, Bush officials made clear that if Congress didn't act, the White House would have to step in to save Detroit from collapse with funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, according to the sources familiar with the conversations. One of the sources said that a White House official made it clear to a GOP senator that would be the worst option, because the loan could go to the auto companies with few or no requirements along with it. The sources asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of private conversations.  Democrats pressed the White House from the start to help Detroit by using some of the $700 billion for the financial sector, but the White House and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson refused. ""I would only hope that the president, who has worked so well with us for the past several weeks, would now consider using the TARP money,"" Reid said after Thursday night's vote.

"Rome (CNN) -- Silvio Berlusconi's long strange trip through Italian politics -- and the nation's justice system -- reached another stop Thursday as a Milan court sentenced the former prime minister to a year in prison for publishing secretly recorded details of a political rival's telephone conversations. The conviction comes less than two weeks after Berlusconi came in a seemingly improbable second among voters as he tried to win back his old job. Whether Berlusconi, 76, will ever set foot in prison is questionable. Berlusconi has been charged and convicted before but has never served time. Previous charges have either been overturned on appeal or dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired. Berlusconi's lawyer, Piero Longo, said he will appeal. ""We are not surprised by the verdict because of the judiciary bias against our client, which is proven here by the lack of evidence against him in this case,"" Longo told CNN. The cult of Silvio Berlusconi: Why Italians keep voting for him . The former prime minister is currently appealing his conviction last year on tax fraud charges relating to the sale of film rights by his media company, Mediaset. He is also on trial over allegations he paid for sex with an underage prostitute. A decision in that case is could come as early as March 18. Details of the case . The case involves publication of details from a 2005 conversation between Piero Fassino -- a political rival of Berlusconi's -- and the former chairman of an insurance group that at the time was close to taking over a large Italian bank. The takeover could have created a rival to Berlusconi's Finnivest conglomerate. The transcript -- published in a newspaper run by Berlusconi's brother, Paolo -- appeared to show Fassino, as head of the center-left opposition, had used his political position to help the insurance group take over Banco Nazionale del Lavoro. The ensuing scandal, which caused the deal to collapse, was widely viewed as an effort to discredit Fassino. The conversation was recorded by Italian financial crimes investigators, according to prosecutors, who argued Berlusconi bribed someone to obtain the recordings, then broke the law by publishing parts of them. Berlusconi has denied listening to the recordings or ordering their publication. Fassino issued a statement lauding the court's decision. ""This is a ruling that restores truth and justice and confirms the judicial system, despite conscious criticism and mocking of the system for years, in a political campaign to vilify and delegitimize it,"" he said. Jail time, fine . According to court documents, Berlusconi was sentenced to one year in prison. Paolo Berlusconi received two years and three months. Silvio Berlusconi was also ordered to pay â‚¬80,000 (about $104,000) plus legal costs to Fassino, whose attorneys had been seeking â‚¬1 million (about $1.3 million) in damages. His lawyers will appeal to increase the award, they said in a statement following the verdict. History of scandal . Berlusconi -- who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011 -- is arguably one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of Italian politics. For years, he has been entangled in fraud, corruption and sex scandals that have often reached Italian courts. Berlusconi's first conviction came in 1997, four years after he was first elected prime minister and a year after he was removed after losing the support of other parties. The sentence in that conviction was suspended. A year later, in 1998, a court convicted him of corruption and bribery, but those verdicts were overturned in 1999 and 2000. In 2007, prosecutors accused him of judicial corruption over accusations he paid a lawyer $600,000 in exchange for favorable testimony in two court case. He was also accused of tax fraud and receipt of stolen goods involving the same lawyer. A judge dismissed some tax fraud allegations and the stolen goods case in 1998; the corruption case ended in 2012 when a judge ruled the statute of limitations had run out. He was convicted in 2012 on allegations that he had engaged in tax fraud involving Mediaset. Prosecutors accused Berlusconi of reducing Mediaset's tax liabilities by purchasing U.S. movie rights at inflated prices and then creating illegal slush funds. He is currently appealing that conviction. Sex scandals have also ensnared Berlusconi, whose wife filed for divorce in 2009 following reports of the then-prime minister's involvement with an 18-year-old girl. Two years later, magistrates in Milan said they were investigating whether Berlusconi paid for sex with an underage prostitute named Ruby the Heartbreaker, then used his power to spring her from jail in an unrelated incident in which she was picked up for theft. Berlusconi's trial on those charges began in 2011, shortly before he resigned from office. Berlusconi has a vast business empire, including media holdings and construction companies. Forbes Magazine says he has a net worth of $6.2 billion. Journalist Barbie Nadeau reported from Rome, Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Peter Wilkinson, Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","NEW: Silvio Berlusconi will appeal the verdict .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea said Monday that a special conference of its ruling Workers' Party would take place next week, an event expected to solidify the authority of its new leader ahead of a controversial rocket launch. The meeting of party delegates, announced by state media, also comes just ahead of a significant anniversary for the secretive, nuclear-armed state -- the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea. At the conference on April 11, Kim Il Sung's grandson, Kim Jong Un, is likely to be named secretary-general of the Workers' Party, a key post that would underline his status as ""supreme leader"" of the insular regime, said Chung-In Moon, professor of political science at Yonsei University in Seoul. That appointment would be ""a very important signal that he's consolidating power and positions from an institutional point of view,"" Moon said. It would also mean that Kim Jong Un would ex officio become chairman of the party's central military committee, following in the footsteps of his father, Kim Jong Il, who died in December. The expected conferring of the new titles on Kim Jong Un is scheduled to happen just before the planned launch of a satellite by Pyongyang between April 12 and 16, using a long-range rocket. The announcement last month of the satellite launch -- which countries like the United States and South Korea see as a cover for a ballistic missile test -- ratcheted up tensions in the region and prompted Washington to suspend a recent deal to supply food aid to the North. International leaders have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, but Pyongyang has refused to back down, insisting that the operation is for peaceful purposes. The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated. Part of the significance of this launch is its timing to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, who ruled the Communist state for more than four decades. His birthday on April 15, known as the ""Day of the Sun,"" is a key public holiday in the North Korean calendar. By holding the party conference a few days before that day, the regime is probably aiming to ensure that Kim Jong Un holds the main titles in time for the big event, Moon said. He is already described by in official North Korean discourse as the ""supreme leader"" of the party, state and army. Moon noted that it is still unclear how directly the young Kim, thought to be in his late 20s, in involved in policy decisions. So far, Kim Jong Un, as the direct descendant of the country's founder, appears to be ""reigning,"" while powerful senior officials in the regime like his uncle, Jang Song Taek, seem to be doing the ""ruling,"" said Moon.","North Korea says it will hold a ruling party conference on April 11 .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea is urging its people to show allegiance to the death for new leader Kim Jong Un. State media KCNA published North Korea's annual New Year's Day message, saying, ""The entire army should place absolute trust in and follow Kim Jong Un and become human rifles and bombs to defend him unto death."" The editorial is jointly published in the North's leading newspapers and is often scrutinized by South Korean and foreign officials for any signs of the North's intentions and policies for the year. The editorial called ""U.S. aggressor forces"" the main obstacle to peace in the Korean peninsula and called for their withdrawal. It criticized ""every move of reckless military provocation, arms buildup and war exercises against the North."" The United States currently has around 28,500 military personnel stationed in South Korea, which North Korea claims is the main impediment to reunification of the Korean people. The United States fought on the side of the South during the 1950-53 war and keeps troops in country as a deterrent against the North. The editorial also renewed the attack against the Lee Myung-bak government in the South, calling government officials ""traitors"" for not allowing more delegations to Pyongyang to pay respects to the late Kim Jong Il. Friday, KCNA quoted a National Defense Commission statement saying Pyongyang ""will have no dealings with the Lee Myung-bak group of traitors forever."" South Korea's Unification Ministry said it found the statement ""regretful. However the ministry's basic principle towards easing tensions in inter-Korean relations and resolving problems through dialogues remains still."" The editorial also claimed North Korea is ""at the epochal point of opening the gates of a thriving country."" For North Korea, 2012 is an important year was it marks 100 years since the birth of founder Kim Il Sung and the year the ""juche,"" or self-reliance policy, will bear fruit, according to the government. The article published the slogan, ""Glorify this year 2012 as a year of proud victory, a year when an era of prosperity is unfolding, true to the instructions of the great General Kim Jong Il."" However, North Korea is still asking the international community for food aid, as it does not have enough food for its people and its economy has been crippled by years of neglect and bad decisions by the leadership. North Korea did not mention its nuclear weapons program, a program that the United States and leaders in the region are pressing North Korea to cease in return for food aid.","North Korean media publish annual New Year's message .

"(CNN) -- Huge crowds in the Vatican cheered Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday as he made his first public appearance since announcing his resignation at the end of the month. He thanked the Roman Catholic faithful in several languages and said it was not appropriate for him to continue as pope. ""I've decided to resign the ministry given to me by the Lord. I've done this in full freedom, for the benefit of the church,"" he told those gathered in a Vatican City audience hall for his regular weekly appearance. Benedict said he is fully aware of the gravity of his decision but he could not carry on as pope ""if I don't have the strength that it requires."" He appeared tired but not visibly unwell as he sat and read his remarks off several sheets of paper. Benedict later celebrated an Ash Wednesday mass that marked the beginning of Lent at St. Peter's Basilica in the afternoon. Opinion: Why pope will be remembered for generations . The service was moved from St. Sabina Church, where it is traditionally held, to the Basilica to accommodate the larger crowd of worshipers, Vatican officials said. News Monday that Benedict was stepping down at the end of February ""because of advanced age"" shocked the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. He is the first pope to resign in nearly 600 years. Benedict will keep working until February 28, meeting with pastors from Rome, Italian bishops, and the visiting presidents of Romania, Guatemala and other countries, according to the Vatican press office. He will hold a final audience in Vatican City's St. Peter's Square on February 27, but the church is not planning a formal ceremony to mark the pope's departure, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said Wednesday. Benedict will simply leave at the end of his typical workday -- 8 p.m. in Vatican City, Lombardi said. The pontiff, born Joseph Ratzinger, will first go to the pope's summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, and then is likely to retire to a monastery and devote himself to a life of reflection and prayer, Lombardi said. He won't be involved in managing the church after his resignation. ""The pope is well and his soul is serene. He did not resign the pontificate because he is ill but because of the fragility that comes with old age,"" Lombardi said. Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone on Wednesday thanked Pope Benedict for his service. ""All of us have understood that it is precisely the deep love that your holiness has for God and the church which pushed you to this act,"" he said. The pope's decision was not linked to a recent medical intervention to replace the battery in his pacemaker, Lombardi said, adding that it had been a routine procedure. Benedict's unexpected move has inevitably prompted frenzied speculation over who might assume the papacy in his place. Opinion: Huge challenges await next pope . The Vatican does not yet know when the cardinals will meet in a conclave to decide who will replace Benedict, but it must begin within 20 days of the pope's resignation, Lombardi said. He had previously said a new pope would be in place before Easter is celebrated at the end of March. While Benedict won't be directly involved in his successor's selection, his influence will undoubtedly be felt. He appointed 67 of the 117 cardinals who are set to make the decision. The number of electors could drop to 115, as two cardinals will turn 80 in March, when their age makes them ineligible to cast a vote. More than two-thirds of the final number of cardinals must agree on the next pope. The announcement that a decision has been made will come in the form of a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the Vatican. Much speculation has focused on whether Benedict's successor might come from Africa or Latin America, rather than Europe, where Roman Catholic congregations are shrinking. The pope's older brother, the Rev. Georg Ratzinger, speaking in Regensburg, Germany, said he expected to see a pope chosen from outside Europe one day -- but not just yet. ""I'm certain a pope will come from the new continents but whether it will be now, I have my doubts,"" he said. ""In Europe, we have many very able people, and the Africans are still not so well known and maybe do not have the experience yet."" Opinion: Echoes of past in pope's resignation . Among those considered front-runners for the role are Cardinal Angelo Scola, archbishop of Milan; Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet, who heads the Vatican's office of bishops; Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, an Argentinian; and Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana. Whoever gets the nod, the selection of a new pontiff is expected to go smoothly. ""We're not going to have a problem of two competing popes. If Pope Benedict still wanted to have influence, he wouldn't have stepped down,"" said senior Vatican communications adviser Greg Burke. While not quite unprecedented, Benedict's resignation is certainly historic. The last pope to step down before his death was Gregory XII, who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope. CNN's Isa Soares, Richard Allen Greene and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","NEW: Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone thanked Pope Benedict for his service .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian pro-government Basij militia members dispersed crowds of protesters here Thursday -- sometimes with force -- witnesses said. Protests by Iranians, such as this one on June 15, have been defended by the reformist figures. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people crowded the streets in different locations of the city, and headed toward Tehran University, the site of a student uprising in 1999. Several protesters were hit on the arms and backs by the Basij, pro-government militia members, while elsewhere riot police released tear gas into crowds. Iran's state-funded Press TV described the crowd size near the university in the hundreds. Some of the protesters shouted ""Allah u Akbar,"" or ""God is Great"" and ""Ya Hussein, Mir Hussein"" referring to opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, the witnesses said. Police blocked roads leading to Tehran University, while some protesters set trash cans afire so smoke would counter the effects of the tear gas. When crowds tried to gather between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. in Revolution Square, hundreds of security forces were waiting for them, witnesses told CNN.  Watch scenes of protesters and street clashes » . Most of the security forces were uniformed officers wearing helmets and holding batons and shields, though many wore plain clothes. The forces ordered bystanders to move along, the witnesses said. There were at least five reports of clashes during this time. Over the next two hours, the crowds grew to around 3,000, but witnesses said security forces grew too. Many of the protesters left Revolution Square and marched to side streets and neighborhoods a few kilometers away. Many held up victory signs and clapped. The contents of several Dumpsters were set afire. See the protests and violence through Iranians' own photos . Witnesses said they heard several pops that sounded like gunshots and saw security forces fire what appeared to be pepper spray towards the crowds on several occasions. Some of the chants heard Thursday were familiar refrains that have been repeated often in recent days: . ""Death to the Dictator!"" ""Death to Khamenei!"" But a new phrase entered the lexicon on Thursday that referred to Mojtaba, the son of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamanei: ""Mojtaba bemire, rahbariroh nagiri,"" they chanted: ""Die, Mojtaba, so you don't become the supreme leader!"" During the past week, rumors have surfaced that Mojtaba has taken over the pro-government Basij militia and that his father is grooming him to be the next supreme leader. Thursday marked the first time protesters chanted against him. By nightfall, most of the demonstrators headed home. At 10 p.m. Tehran time two sources told CNN the chants of ""God is great!"" were louder than usual in their neighborhoods. The demonstration took place on the 10th anniversary of a student uprising that posed a major threat to the Islamic regime. On Thursday, the protesters used the anniversary to resume demonstrations against the outcome of the contested June 12 presidential election. Iranian-American journalist Jason Rezaian said Iranians have been scared since last month's bloody crackdown on those who protested the accuracy of election results. Incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner by a landslide over reformist candidate Moussavi, his chief rival, who declared the election rigged. Moussavi's supporters took to the streets by the thousands in the aftermath of the vote until the protests turned bloody as security forces cracked down. Iranian state-run media said 20 people have been killed and more than 1,000 have been detained. On July 9, 1999, known in the Iranian calendar as the 18th of Tir, 200 students protested the closing of a reformist newspaper, Salaam, which supported moderate President Mohammed Khatami. Hard-line activists entered dormitories in Tehran University, broke windows, set fires and attacked students. Six days of protests ensued. According to Human Rights Watch, more than 25,000 people participated, making the demonstrations the biggest threat to the Islamic regime since its inception in 1979.

"(CNN) -- At least four people were killed and hundreds more were injured in fresh clashes in the volatile city of Port Said, Egypt's health ministry said Monday. More than 150 of those hurt were still in the hospital as of noon local time, ministry spokesman Dr. Yehya Moussa said. A government security building was set ablaze as police and protesters clashed, witnesses said. The violence snowballed throughout the weekend, as a March 9 verdict date neared for 52 defendants involved in a deadly riot at a soccer game in February 2012. Fear and loathing in Egypt: The fallout from Port Said . Twenty-one defendants already have been sentenced to death for their alleged roles in the so-called ""massacre at Port Said,"" when 74 people were killed and 1,000 injured after the Port Said-based al-Masry team defeated Cairo's al-Ahry 13 months ago. Soccer fans in the restive Egyptian city also clashed with security forces and torched a police station Saturday, according to the interior ministry. The Green Ultras, fans of al-Masry, are often in the middle of political violence. Egypt's football season opens -- with no fans in the stands . Reports surfaced that amid the weekend tumult, soldiers fought with police. And the state-run MENA news agency reported two of the those killed Monday were army conscripts. But a spokesman for Egypt's armed forces denied any conflict between the uniformed personnel. ""It is completely untrue that armed forces units in Port Said exchanged fire with police forces during the clashes,"" Col. Ahmed Ali posted on his Facebook page Sunday night. Port Said, in northeastern Egypt, near the Sinai Peninsula, has had a tense relationship with Cairo dating back about 60 years. Many residents of Port Said felt Egyptian security forces didn't adequately defend the city during the series of wars with Israel that began with the Jewish state's creation in 1948 and ended after the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. In addition, some Port Said residents say the central government doesn't invest enough of the tax dollars it reaps from international ships traveling through the Suez Canal back into in Port Said.

"(CNN) -- Ellen Ferrell thinks that three turns through a body scanner, coupled with comments about her ""cute figure,"" aren't necessary for security at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Speaking of the Transportation Security Administration officials who examined her before a flight months ago, Terrell told CNN affiliate CBS 11 News, ""They wanted a nice good look."" Ferrell's case may be one of many, according to a CBS 11 News review of more than 500 records of TSA complaints. The News 11 team found a pattern of women who believe that there was nothing random about the way they were selected for extra screening. Their complaints must be striking a chord. The TSA's chief blogger, known as Blogger Bob, jumped into the debate Wednesday. He says that Ferrell failed to file a complaint with the agency, which would have allowed the TSA to review video of the scene. (Ferrell told the TV station she didn't know she could file a complaint.) Blogger Bob encourages people to file complaints online or to call the agency at 866-289-9673. Blogger Bob's post comes days after U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, mentioned Ferrell's name at a Sunday press conference. Schumer announced plans to introduce legislation this week to require every airport where TSA operates to have a ""TSA Passenger Advocate"" who can be summoned to security checkpoints. (Schumer already had planned the legislation in response to allegations of TSA strip searches of an elderly passenger at a New York airport.) Blogger Bob didn't mention Ferrell by name but issued several rebuttals about her story: . • The TSA does not profile passengers. • The technology in place at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport ""no longer displays a specific image of the person being screened."" • The old technology ""looked more like fuzzy photo negatives than the images that some make them out to be."" • Agents do not scan people multiple times.","Some women complain of extra security searches at airport, CNN affiliate reports .

"(CNN)  -- Web-page addresses can be notoriously long, but even the normal ones seem absolutely huge in our age of Twitter and text messaging. Every letter counts when you have only 140 characters. Now Google hopes to revolutionize the Web address shortening arena with Goo.gl, now available to the public through its website at http://goo.gl. Goo.gl was originally a proprietary way for Google to abbreviate its Web addresses within services such as Google News (for saving article links) or Google Maps (for sending a location). The new Goo.gl website will abbreviate your links and store them for you to view later or share with others. Google says it is also using special provisions to prevent blind links from leading to malware or dangerous websites. But Google is entering a super-crowded arena. TinyURL has been abbreviating Web addresses for nearly a decade, and the advent of Twitter has encouraged more sophisticated abbreviators, like bit.ly, which allow people to organize and search through their saved links. Individual media sites have also created their own abbreviations: http://nyti.ms for The New York Times, for example, and http://t.co for Twitter. As ReadWriteWeb notes, the biggest advantage Google has over the smaller abbreviators is its massive size and the connection between dozens of its services. That may be enough to make it the top web shortener in short order.","Google hopes to revolutionize Web address shortening arena with Goo.gl .

"(CNN) -- The most comprehensive cybersecurity legislation proposed by Congress, which sponsors say would have helped protect the government and industry from potentially devastating cyberattacks, was voted down in the Senate Thursday. The Cybersecurity Act of 2012 would have given the government the three legislative elements it needs to fend off cyberattacks, according to John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. Those are new threat-information-sharing between the government and private industry, better protection of critical infrastructure such as the power grid and water filtration facilities, and authority for the Department of Homeland Security to unite federal resources to lead the government's cybersecurity team. Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, introduced the bill. ""This is a moment of disappointment that I really cannot conceal,"" Lieberman said after the vote. ""But the threat of cyberattack is so real, so urgent and so clearly growing that I am not going to be petulant about this."" On a telephone conference all with reporters Wednesday, Brennan and with other administration officials urged Congress to pass the bill. ""The risks to our nation are real and immediate,"" Brennan said, adding that the White House didn't see the legislation as a partisan issue, but rather a matter of national security. Republicans opposed to the bill argued that the cybersecurity standards that would have been put in place allow for too much government regulation. ""How can the Senate ignore these repeated warnings from the experts of how at risk our national security, our economic prosperity, and indeed our American way of life it is,"" Collins asked. ""It just is incomprehensible to me that we would not proceed to this bill. There certainly is plenty of blame to go around."" Congress begins its August recess Friday, making it very unlikely that cybersecurity legislation will be voted on again before next year.","The bill would have given the government three paths to fend off cyberattacks .

"(CNN) -- Americans are drowning in debt. Consumers have racked up more than $2.2 trillion in purchases and cash advances on major credit cards in just the last year. And it's become a habit for them to spend more than they have. The overall credit card debt grew by 315 percent from 1989 to 2006, according to public policy research firm Demos. To compound the problem,  fewer people are paying their credit cards bills on time. The percentage of people delinquent on their credit cards is the highest it's been in three years, according to CardTrack.com. With banks tightening their standards and the drumbeat of recession getting louder, there's no better time to grab control of your debt than now. First, you have to determine if your credit card spending habits are out of control. Here are some signs: . Once you've made a list of your debts, it's time to prioritize your payments. Interest rates, on average, can range from 10 to 18 percent, according to Curtis Arnold of Cardratings.com. Tackle your highest-interest credit card first. With rates averaging about 14.5 percent, you really want to knock out the high-interest debts quickly. Try shifting high-interest credit card debt onto cards that have lower interest rates. The principal is not the only problem, it's also the interest you're accruing. If you have a $2,000 balance at a 14 percent interest rate -- and make just the minimum payments -- it will take you more than 14 years to pay off that debt plus the interest.  Try to pay more than the minimum payments on your credit cards whenever you can. Another tip: Keep a close eye on your card's interest rates and find out if there is room for negotiation . Credit card companies are increasing fees and cutting credit limits, and some are increasing rates, according to Arnold, so be sure to scrutinize your monthly statements. Often the details of these changes are included in the fine print on your statement. If you've been a good customer and you have good credit, now is a good time to negotiate for a higher credit limit or to knock some points off your interest rate, says John Ulzheimer of Credit.com. All it takes is a phone call. And it could save you hundreds of dollars in interest payments. Many credit card issuers already have policies in place. These credit card companies don't want to lose your business. Of course, if you don't have a great credit history or you've made a few late payments, you may not get anywhere. One of the most important steps you can take in tackling debt is improving your credit. Your credit report is being even more closely scrutinized today by credit card issuers, mortgage lenders, auto dealers, insurance carriers and even potential employers. Also, don't close old credit cards accounts. Even if you don't use them frequently, it looks better for your credit score if you can show a long credit history, said Ulzheimer. And, he says, delay some spending. As a rule of thumb, you should try not to use more than 10 percent of your credit limit when making purchases. ""The people with the best credit have a utilization rate of no more than 7 percent,"" he says. If your credit utilization is 50 percent or more of your credit limit, you are doing some real damage to your credit score, says Craig Watts of Fair Isaac, one of the companies that provides credit scores. When the new FICO '08 scoring model is adapted in May, if you have a utilization of over 50 percent, you'll be penalized even more heavily E-mail to a friend .","Americans put $2.2 trillion in debt on their credit cards last year .

"Washington (CNN) -- The future of the DREAM Act has become something of a nightmare for Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Congressional leaders and the Obama administration are fighting it out, and each is making the case for why the legislation should be passed or rejected during the lame-duck session of Congress. The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act would grant eligibility for citizenship for thousands of  young illegal immigrants if they go to college or serve in the military. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Thursday, ""I urge the Congress to pass the DREAM Act and set aside old labels."" Speaking to reporters via a White House conference call, Napolitano said, ""There are compelling reasons to support it. ... It will strengthen the military and strengthen the economy."" Napolitano urged Congress to act ""and come together on a bipartisan basis and in the grand tradition of this country."" She said the DREAM Act would help people who were  ""brought here by others ... not of their own volition ... but were brought here by parents or smuggled into the country by human traffickers."" The ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said there have been no hearings on the bill and lawmakers have not seen the text of the legislation. Even so, he said, House Democrats are considering bringing up the act on Friday. In a written statement, Smith said the bill could grant amnesty to more than 2 million illegal immigrants. ""Mass amnesty is not the only problem with the DREAM Act,"" he said. ""The bill allows illegal immigrants to receive in-state tuition at public universities, placing them ahead of U.S. citizens. The bill also is a magnet for fraud."" Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, contended that ""while the bill continues to be disguised as an educational initiative, it is simply another measure that offers a path to citizenship for illegals in this country."" In a letter to the Congressional Budget Office, Vitter said, ""It is imperative that members of Congress and the American people know the estimated cost of the DREAM Act before a single vote is cast on this legislation."" Napolitano told reporters an earlier version of the bill scored by the CBO estimated the cost as ""basically neutral. The cost argument doesn't hold water.""","The act would make immigrants eligible for citizenship if they go to college or join the military .

"(CNN) -- A California judge ruled Monday that a then 10-year-old boy committed second-degree murder -- and knew what he was doing was wrong -- when he fatally shot his father, a local neo-Nazi leader. Jeffrey Hall was asleep on a couch in his family's Riverside home when his son killed him on May 1, 2011, according to authorities. CNN is not naming the boy, who is now 12, because he is a juvenile. Hall had been the Southwestern states regional director for the National Socialist Movement, according to an online tribute to him from the group's leader, Jeff Schoep. One of the nation's biggest, most well-known neo-Nazi organizations, the National Socialist Movement idolizes Adolf Hitler and touts virulent rhetoric against those who are Jewish, immigrants and not ""pure-blood whites,"" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center civil rights group. Prosecutors contend the victim's neo-Nazi background is not linked to his death, saying the young killer's concerns about abuse and his family being split up were more significant factors. ""It was our belief that this would have happened even if (Hall) was not part of the National Socialist Movement,"" said John Hall, a spokesman for the Riverside County district attorney's office. ""This was done more on a domestic level."" According to an arrest warrant issued for Hall's wife, Krista McCary, and posted from the Southern California Public Radio's website, Riverside police arrived in May 2011 at what they described as a ""filthy,"" unkempt home and found the victim dead on the coach ""with a gunshot wound to the left side of his head."" Five children -- ages 10, 9, 7, 3 and a 2-month old -- were inside the home at the time, as was McCary, the warrant said. Three of the children later told a detective they knew where guns were inside the house, according to the arrest warrant. The eldest said he'd taken a revolver off a low shelf in his father's and stepmother's closet, then killed his sleeping father. The boy told police ""he was tired of his dad hitting him and his mom,"" and that he thought his father was having an affair that might contribute to the family's break-up. Less than three weeks after Hall's death, McCary was arrested and charged with five counts of willful child endangerment and four counts of criminal storage of a firearm, according to Riverside Superior Court records. In August 2011, she pleaded guilty to one count of each charge and was sentenced to 120 days in custody (all but two of them in work release) and four years of probation. The boy has been detained in juvenile halls in Riverside County since the shooting. His lawyers initially sought an insanity defense but later dropped that approach and argued their client didn't fully grasp the ramifications of what he did, according to John Hall, the district attorney's spokesman. The murder trial before county Judge Jean Leonard -- and not a jury -- got underway October 30, 2012, continuing off-and-on for about 10 days over four months, ending Monday. As there are no ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" verdicts in her California juvenile court, Leonard instead found it ""true"" that the boy had committed murder and understood his actions were wrong. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for February 15, where placement of the boy will be determined. The convicted boy could remain in custody up until his 23rd birthday, though he could be freed sooner or have a number of other living arrangements as determined by the judge, said John Hall. Schoep recalled the 32-year-old victim -- pictured on the tribute website raising a National Socialist Movement flag, which contains a swastika -- as a ""dedicated father"" who ""spent countless hours on the California and Arizona border leading patrols in efforts to halt illegal immigration, (and organized) events for the NSM countless times."" Schoep's ex-wife Joanna told the Southern Poverty Law Center that Hall was her ex-husband's best friend. The same civil rights group described Jeff Hall as ""something of a rising star in the neo-Nazi universe."" A public advocate for a ""white nation,"" he led rallies full of white supremacists giving Nazi salutes at a day-laborer center and synagogues, in addition to his border patrol activities, according to the law center. He was also a politician of sorts, earning nearly 30% of the vote -- after he'd publicly stood by his neo-Nazi views -- in a race to join the Western Municipal Water District board of directors in Riverside County.","A boy, then 10, fatally shot his father in 2011 as he was sleeping on a couch .

"(CNN) -- An alleged gang member who was on the FBI's Top 10 List of most wanted fugitives and sought in connection with a 2000 attack on two Los Angeles, California, officers was captured in Mexico, authorities said Monday. Emigdio Preciado Jr., believed to be 39, was captured Friday in the hills Yagos, Mexico, according to the FBI. Emigdio Preciado Jr., who is believed to be 39, was captured Friday in the town of Santiago Escuintla in western central Mexico, north of coastal Puerto Vallarta, according to Mexican authorities. He had been living there, using the name Regalo Castaneda-Castaneda and working as a fisherman, the FBI said. Authorities believe Preciado stepped out of a van and opened fire on two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies with an assault rifle in September 2000, according to the FBI. Twenty-one rounds were fired; one hit a deputy in the head and critically injured him. The deputy has since recovered and returned to duty. The FBI said that although Preciado's identifying tattoos had been surgically removed, Mexican police and FBI agents confirmed his identity through fingerprints at the time of his arrest. Specific details regarding Preciado's capture were not released. But Sal Hernandez, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said a reward of $150,000 offered on the FBI Web site would be paid. ""The significance of the publicity in this case and the reward offered cannot be understated,"" Hernandez said, according to the statement. Preciado, a U.S. citizen, is in the custody of Mexican federal police, the FBI said. He is expected to be transferred to Mexico City, where extradition proceedings will take place. Preciado was sought on a California parole violation at the time of the 2000 shooting, authorities said in the statement, and has an extensive criminal record. He was added to the FBI's Top 10 list in March 2007.","Sought in connection with 2000 attack on two Los Angeles, California, officers .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department says it has decided not to charge former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales or other Bush administration officials in the controversial firings of nine U. S. attorneys, according to a letter sent to the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Special counsel Nora Dannehy investigated the firings and Attorney General Eric Holder ""has accepted her recommendation that criminal prosecution is not warranted,"" the letter said. The question as to whether the dismissals were made for political reasons led to a huge controversy in Washington. Gonzales ultimately resigned. In the letter, Associate Attorney General Ronald Welch said Gonzales made ""inaccurate and misleading"" statements about the firings. The report also said Gonzales' chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, also made misleading statements. But the report by Dannehy concluded there was ""insufficient evidence to establish that persons knowingly made material false statements"" or tried to obstruct justice. An earlier report by the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility drew particular attention to the 2006 firing of New Mexico's U.S. attorney, David Iglesias, and whether he was fired to influence voter fraud prosecutions in his state. Dannehy's probe did not find ""any prosecutable criminal offense was committed with regard to the removal of David Iglesias."" George Terwilliger, a lawyer representing former Gonzales, issued a statement welcoming the end of the 22-month investigation and saying Gonzales was ""vindicated by the Justice Department's long overdue conclusion."" The statement said Gonzales had consistently maintained he had done nothing wrong.

"COPENHAGEN, Denamrk (CNN) -- What makes someone decide to become an actor? It sometimes seems as if the average Hollywood star is motivated mainly by the promise of a fat pay check. Connie Nielsen shot to fame playing Lucilla in ""Gladiator."" Or perhaps they're drawn to the celebrity lifestyle. Maybe they crave the love of an adoring public, or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world, to be immortalized on celluloid. For Danish actress Connie Nielsen it was something quite different. For her, being an actor means being an outsider. ""As an artist you actually do have to make a choice to be an outsider. If you're an outsider you have the freedom to say what people on the inside don't dare to say,"" she told CNN. So Connie Nielsen is not your typical movie star. As a 5-foot-10-inch blonde Scandinavian beauty she has the looks of a classic silver screen siren, but she has steadfastly resisted a career as Hollywood eye candy and rejected the lifestyle that goes with it. ""I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business,"" she says. ""I refuse even the money side of my business. I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth,"" she says. Raised in Elling, a small coastal village in Denmark, she is fluent in seven languages and studied acting in France and Italy, making her screen debut in French comedy ""Par Où T'es Rentré? On T'a Pas Vu Sortir"" (U.S. title ""How Did You Get In? We Didn't See You Leave"") in 1984. She appeared in more French and Italian movies before landing a role opposite Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves in ""The Devil's Advocate"" in 1997. But it wasn't until 2000, when she was cast in Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ""Gladiator"", that Nielsen landed a role that really let her show her acting ability. As Lucilla, the sister of the villainous Emperor Commodus, Nielsen brought some much-needed subtlety to the swords-and-sandals epic and held her own sharing the screen with Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe. The movie made Nielsen an international star and she scored other successes with ""One Hour Photo"" in 2002, and ""The Hunted"" in 2003. But while the success of ""Gladiator"" opened doors for her, it also meant she had to fight the kind of typecasting that would try to limit her to playing ""the love interest"" to a male lead who got all the good lines. Nielsen has in the past been critical of Hollywood for its lack of female roles, saying ""you think once you've shown what you can do, and your movies have been successful, that snap, you work. So to discover the difference between guys' roles and girls' roles made me plain mad. It's unjust."" But Nielsen has refused to be pigeonholed, seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies. She appeared in French movie ""Demonlover"", which dealt with pornography, violence and corporate amorality, while more recent films have taken on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Danish drama ""Brødre"" (U.S. title ""Brothers"") is about a soldier who returns from Afghanistan a broken man, unable to communicate his experiences from the conflict. Playing his wife, Nielsen put in a powerful performance that won her awards and served to highlight how Hollywood had underused her talents. ""The Situation"" in 2006 was billed as the first film to be made about the Iraq war and told the story of ordinary Iraqis caught up in the conflict, while ""Battle of Seattle"" examined how peaceful protests erupted into riots when the World Trade Organization met in Seattle in 1999. Of her choice of subject matter, Nielsen says that rather than making a political point she is trying to show the human aspects of the conflicts. But Nielsen makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies. She is passionate about literature and art and she is currently dating Lars Ulrich, drummer of rock group Metallica. She had a son with him in 2007 and has another son from a previous relationship. ""I will always find something that I want to try and become better at. I always love to spend more time with my friends, more time with my family, my extended family. I always want to read more books,"" she says. Perhaps her commitment to her art, her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her Danish upbringing, but there's no doubt that compared to many other Hollywood stars Connie Nielsen is a breath of fresh air.","Connie Nielsen made her name playing Lucilla in Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator""

"(CNN) -- It's a record any studio would love to have. A boy tags along with an old man and his traveling house in the new Pixar movie, ""Up."" Including its first feature, ""Toy Story,"" in 1995, the animation powerhouse Pixar has released nine full-length films. All nine have been both financial and critical successes. There has to be a secret, right? Right? Uh, no, says Pete Docter, the director of Pixar's 10th feature, ""Up,"" which opens Friday. ""I don't really think it's much of a secret,"" he told CNN. ""I think it comes down to two basic things: one is that we're run by artists. ... John Lasseter is a film director, as opposed to being from a business school or whatever. He has that side of him as well, but he's always approaching these things as the same way we are. ""Second, we have some pretty great people that they've managed to collect here. This is our 10th film, and every film has just gotten better and better, whether that be in animation or special effects or lighting. And it just all comes together to make for some really fantastic stuff.""  Watch a preview of the film » . Indeed, the studio hasn't followed any particular formula. There have been big stars involved in Pixar films -- Tom Hanks and Paul Newman have both participated -- but the name voices in Pixar's biggest box-office success, ""Finding Nemo,"" were comedians Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres. The looks have included the squarish angles of suburbia (""Toy Story""), slick candy colors (""Cars""), classic, rubbery characters (""Ratatouille"") and high technology (""WALL-E""). And though there are occasional pop-cultural references, such as those favored by Pixar's competition, in general the humor is organic to the story. And story always comes first, says ""Up"" producer Jonas Rivera. ""One of the things that I really love about [Pixar] is that no matter what you do, if you're a production assistant or a producer or a marketing executive or running the kitchen, everyone here thinks like filmmakers,"" he said. ""Up"" took five years to create, Rivera said, and his biggest fear was ""it's not gonna stay true"" to the original concept. In the case of ""Up,"" the story involves the elderly Carl Fredricksen, voiced by Ed Asner, who had a happy marriage and a career as a balloon seller for many years. After his wife dies and he's threatened with eviction, Fredricksen decides to fly his house -- using hundreds of balloons -- to South America, a place that always had romantic meaning for him and his wife. Much to Fredricksen's initial chagrin, however, he has a stowaway, a Junior Wilderness Explorer named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai). The two are forced to become mutually dependent in the course of their adventures. The film has a number of gorgeous set pieces -- the house flying away, the wonder of a dramatic waterfall (the latter inspired by an episode of the documentary series ""The Living Edens,"" said Rivera) -- but what was most challenging was an early sequence in which 50 years of Carl's life is compressed into four minutes, said Docter, the director. ""We wrote like 20 minutes' worth of stuff and kept cutting away, cutting away until we got just down to the essence,"" he said, praising story artist Ronnie del Carmen's storyboard work. ""I was just hoping we wouldn't ruin it, because there's just such a beautiful quality of the way he draws. As it turns out, I think everybody just stepped up."" Asner -- as amusingly crusty in person as he is on screen -- praised that scene as ""a grabber"" but said he also loved the film's ""small moments,"" in his words, including scenes of Fredricksen's solitary house surrounded by bulldozed space and Russell sitting on a log in front of a campfire. He said he's prouder, though, of the film's message. ""It's a very gratifying film for me to put under my belt because of the philosophy inherent in it,"" he said. ""Do no harm. Do good when you can. Live life. Don't live in the past. Find the future and react to the love that's given you."" ""Up,"" which premiered at Europe's prestigious Cannes Film Festival, faces a crowded marketplace, with ""Star Trek,"" the new ""Night at the Museum"" and ""Terminator Salvation"" all staking a claim on audience loyalties. But the toughest critics might be at Pixar itself. After all, four of the studio's films have won the Oscar for best animated feature. All but two have earned more than $200 million at the domestic box office. And every single one has been praised by critics -- a handful, such as 2007's ""Ratatouille,"" receiving almost unanimous acclaim. iReport.com: Did Disney's latest leave you in an 'Up'beat mood? Share your review . It's a tough act to follow. But that's where the studio really may have a secret weapon, Docter said. ""We use ourselves as the first test audience,"" he said. ""We know that the audience is going to be diverse: my mom, my grandmother, my kids; everybody is going to be in there. But the first audience is us."" Rivera added, ""The bar raises, and we're all very self-competitive but at the same time supportive. Like, I didn't work on 'WALL-E,' but I feel like it's mine, you know? And I want that to look great and be great. And then I want that bar to be higher and for us to be challenged.""

"(CNN) -- When Ji Yeqing awakened, she was already in the recovery room. Chinese authorities had dragged her out of her home and down four flights of stairs, she said, restraining and beating her husband as he tried to come to her aid. They whisked her into a clinic, held her down on a bed and forced her to undergo an abortion. Her offense? Becoming pregnant with a second child, in violation of China's one-child policy. ""After the abortion, I felt empty, as if something was scooped out of me,"" Ji told a congressional panel in September. ""My husband and I had been so excited for our new baby. Now suddenly all that hope and joy and excitement disappeared. ... I was very depressed and despondent. For a long time, whenever I thought about my lost child, I would cry."" As she lay unconscious, she said, an IUD to prevent future pregnancies was inserted. The issue of forced abortions -- and in some cases, forced sterilizations -- in China has seized the spotlight in recent days with news of escaped activist Chen Guangcheng. Chen, a blind, self-taught lawyer, rose to fame in the late 1990s because of his advocacy for what he calls victims of abusive practices, such as forced abortions, by Chinese family planning officials. He investigated forced abortions and sterilizations in eastern China -- a practice China denies -- and helped organize a class-action lawsuit on behalf of victims, for which he served four years in prison. A fellow activist, Hu Jia, said Chen has taken refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. ""Chen may be safe for the moment, but the women for whom he risked everything are not,"" said Reggie Littlejohn, president of Women's Rights Without Frontiers, a California-based organization that describes itself as a ""broad-based, international coalition that opposes forced abortion and sexual slavery in China."" ""Forced abortion is not a choice,"" Littlejohn said. ""It is official government rape."" On a January 2011 visit to the United States, Chinese President Hu Jintao reportedly denied that China was forcing women to submit to abortions. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, who gave Hu a list of human rights concerns, said that Hu insisted a forced-abortion policy did not exist, according to media reports. China's population is the largest on earth, with more than 1.34 billion people. Since its implementation in 1979, the one-child policy has prevented more than 400 million births in China, according to China's National Population and Family Planning Commission. About 13 million abortions are performed nationwide each year, the commission has said -- about 35,000 a day. It is unknown how many of those are coerced. But the one-child policy has been blamed for abuses. In some cases, advocates say, fetuses identified as female are aborted, or midwives strangle a female infant with the umbilical cord during delivery, identifying the baby as ""stillborn,"" according to All Girls Allowed, a nonprofit group that aims to end female ""gendercide,"" educate abandoned girls, rescue trafficked children and defend women's reproductive rights. Other females are abandoned, left to die or raised as orphans. Chinese traditionally prefer boys over girls because they are seen as better able to provide for the family and carry on the family bloodline. As a result, the practice of aborting female fetuses or abandoning infant girls continues, particularly in rural areas. In November, according to state-run news agency Xinhua, Premier Wen Jiabao, in a speech to the National Working Conference on Women and Children, ""urged banning illegal fetus gender identification and illegal abortion."" ""The social status of the female population indicates the level of social progress (of a nation), while children are the future and hope of a nationality and a nation,"" Wen said. Last summer, Xinhua reported that ""millions of Chinese men of marrying age may be living as frustrated bachelors by 2020"" because of the gender imbalance. In 2010, China's sex ratio at birth was 118 boys for every 100 girls, the news agency said. China kicked off a national campaign ""to significantly curb non-medical sex determinations and sex-selective abortions to balance the gender ratio,"" Xinhua said. Also during the campaign, ""efforts will be made to raise awareness of gender equality, to severely punish those involved in cases of non-medical sex determinations and sex-selective abortions, and to strengthen monitoring."" Liu Qian, vice minister of the Ministry of Health, said that doctors violating the ban would be stripped of their licenses or penalized, and involved medical institutions would also be punished, according to Xinhua. The one-child policy could contribute to China's high rate of female suicide, according to All Girls Allowed. China is the only country in the world where the female suicide rate is higher than that of men -- some 500 women a day, the group said, citing statistics from the World Health Organization and the U.S. State Department. In its 2009 Human Rights Report, the State Department noted that ""many observers believed that violence against women and girls, discrimination in education and employment, the traditional preference for male children, birth-limitation policies, and other societal factors contributed to the high female suicide rate. Women in rural areas, where the suicide rate for women was three to four times higher than for men, were especially vulnerable."" Sometimes the consequences are even more severe. In October 2011, a woman who was six months pregnant died during a forced abortion in eastern China, according to Women's Rights Without Frontiers. Last month, a woman in the same region was forced to undergo an abortion while nine months pregnant, the organization reported. The baby was born alive, but then was drowned in a bucket, according to the organization. A photo of the infant's body floating in the bucket was circulated on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, sparking widespread outrage. Chinese officials are prohibited under law from ""infringing on the rights and interests of citizens when promoting compliance with population planning policies,"" according to the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, created by Congress to monitor human rights and the rule of law in China. However, the commission in its most recent annual report noted ""reports of official campaigns, as well as numerous individual cases in which officials used violent methods to coerce citizens to undergo sterilizations or abortions or pay heavy fines for having 'out-of-plan' children,"" meaning a family's second child. In one example from October 2010, the commission said, a woman in southeastern China who was eight months pregnant with her second child was kidnapped and detained for 40 hours. She was forcibly injected with a substance that caused the fetus to abort. Her husband reportedly was not permitted to see her during this time, the commission said. ""Nothing in human history compares to the magnitude of China's 33-year assault on women and children,"" said Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey and chairman of the commission, during the September hearing at which Ji Yeqing testified. ""Today in China, rather than being given maternal care, pregnant women without birth-allowed permits are hunted down and forcibly aborted. ... For over three decades, brothers and sisters have been illegal; a mother has absolutely no right to protect her unborn baby from state-sponsored violence."" ""Out of plan"" children whose parents do not pay fines may go without household registration, or hukou, which presents obstacles to social benefits including subsidized health care and public education, All Girls Allowed said, citing the commission's 2010 report. A woman's family members, including her husband, parents, in-laws or siblings, may also be targeted for violations of the policy, according to Women's Rights Without Borders, which published a 2005 report compiled from Chen's notes into cases he was investigating before his arrest. The report alleges arrest, torture, beatings and fines of family members for the violations of relatives. It also documents a case where a woman suffered health problems after being forced to undergo a tubal ligation despite her high blood pressure. Ji told lawmakers her first forced abortion was in 2003, after officials said she and her husband would be fined $31,000 for their second child and fired from their jobs. Her second came in 2006, despite the fact she and her husband at that time were willing to pay the fine and lose their jobs. She continues to suffer consequences from the abortions. Her husband divorced her, she said, because she could not give him a son (the couple already had a daughter). After she remarried and moved to the United States in 2010, she said, she visited a clinic to have her IUD removed and undergo an exam. ""The doctor told me that I had cervical erosion, likely due to the poor medical conditions of my forced abortions,"" she said. Liu Ping told a similar story to Congress last year. She said after giving birth to her son, she was required to undergo five abortions between 1983 and 1990. During the last procedure, an IUD was inserted. ""When I learned of the procedure, I protested that I had a kidney disease and could not keep the IUD, but they completely ignored me,"" she said. ""The doctor just gave the bill to my husband and told him to pay."" Her husband was later arrested, she said, and she was given a ""serious administrative warning"" at her job and fined six months' pay. Liu had to report to the factory clinic each month for an exam to make sure she had not removed the IUD on her own or become pregnant again, she said. In 1997, she missed a monthly pregnancy check because she was caring for her terminally ill mother, she testified. ""Agents from the Family Planning Commission waited at my home to drag me to the exam,"" she said. ""When they pushed me to the ground, I fell and hurt my neck vertebrae. My spirit completely collapsed after this one. I attempted suicide, but was stopped by my family from jumping."" Liu was able to move to the United States and she and her husband reconciled after a divorce. ""I feel happiness and joyful,"" she told lawmakers. ""But I know in my homeland, China, there are millions of women who are suffering as I did. Each day thousands of young lives are being destroyed. I beg everyone to save them.""

"(CNN) -- When ""La Bamba"" hit movie screens in 1987, audiences flocked to see the true story of singer Ritchie Valens, who died as a teen in an airplane crash almost three decades earlier. ""La Bamba"" starred Lou Diamond Phillips as singer Ritchie Valens. It's one of 40 films featured in the festival. But it was memorable for another reason. The film was the first box office hit directed by a Latino filmmaker and starring mostly Latino actors, said Chon Noriega, a professor of cinema and media studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""La Bamba"" is part of the Latino Images in Film festival, which begins Tuesday and runs through May on Turner Classic Movies. The event features 40 films that show how Latinos have been depicted on the big screen and is part of the network's ""Race and Hollywood"" series. (Turner Classic Movies, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) Noriega, who chose the films and also co-hosts the festival, talked with CNN.com about what he hopes viewers will take away from the movie line-up.  Watch clips from some of the classic films » . The following is a edited version of that interview. CNN: What was your selection process? Chon Noriega: I decided I was going to focus specifically on Hollywood films that look substantively at either Latino characters or the Latino community. I came up with a master list of films, and it's only about 70. There really haven't been that many that have dealt explicitly with the Latino population. And then, from there, we looked at what was available. CNN: When you talk about Latino images, who do you include in that description? Noriega: It's a kind of pan-ethnic, multiracial category. But basically in terms of the series, what it reflects is Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. There really haven't been, as far as I can tell, many Hollywood films that go beyond those three major groups. CNN: What do you hope to accomplish with this movie lineup? Noriega: By and large, these are films that really haven't been seen since their original release. We really don't have an idea of what the history has been in terms of how Hollywood has dealt with or represented what is now a pretty sizeable part of our population. We have an idea of what the stereotypes have been in terms of the kind of expendable characters that emerge within Westerns or action films, background characters like maids. CNN: What do you mean by expendable characters? Noriega: If I'm watching a science-fiction film and there happens to be a Latino character, I know that that character is going to be the first one to die. (laughs) It is almost inevitable. Or in a Western. They're really not there as characters; they're there as foils for the largely white characters that are defining the film and the story. To my mind, it's valuable just to go back and just see that these are the films that at different points represent how not just Hollywood but our society was trying to figure out where Latinos fit within the national culture. CNN: As people watch these movies, from very early Hollywood to the 1990s, what is the progression of Latino characters? Noriega: I don't know that we see a single trajectory of going from either one thing to another or from bad to better. You see certain recurring figures or types. You see different versions of the gangster kind of morphing into the gang member. But it's more or less an urban outlaw type, and that persists. I think you see little shifts in terms of when they're being made and who is making them. You have some of the same characters in ""My Family/Mi Familia,"" but it's being made by a Chicano filmmaker as part of an attempt to show a very diverse view of what a family can be. CNN: What's your take on white actors playing Latino characters? Noriega: Actually, [co-host] Robert Osborne and I kind of went back and forth on that throughout the series because I think there are two views. One is: Actors are actors, and they play make-believe, and they pretend to be different types of characters, and in an ideal world, actors should be able to play anything they are able to do effectively. But when you look at it sociologically, you see it's only working one way, and that's where I think there's a problem. In the history of Hollywood, we're maybe able to identify 70 films that really focus on Latino characters, family or community, and a third of those have white actors playing the Latinos. And Latino actors are not really getting the same opportunity to play other types. CNN: How did the industry try to ""transform"" actors into Latino characters? Noriega: The Latino population -- and it's part of the irony of this -- it's not a racial group. It's a multiracial, multi-ethnic group. We talk about that in terms of ""West Side Story,"" where everybody's identified how Natalie Wood was in brownface playing a Puerto Rican. But in 1980, there was a revival of it on Broadway, and they actually cast a Puerto Rican actress. In the makeup room, they started putting brownface on her, [because] she wasn't dark enough to meet the expectations of what a Latina character would look like on stage. I've done focus groups with Latino actors in the Screen Actors Guild, and they continually talk about that there are these expectations of what a Latino character is going to look like and more often than not, Latino actors don't look like that. (laughs) CNN: What do you think about how Latinos are portrayed in film today? Noriega: We have a somewhat broader cohort of actors who are known, who are included in films, not always starring, but they get secondary roles in films and so there's in some sense more of a presence. When you look at the statistics in terms of the overall presence of Latinos in film and television, the numbers really haven't changed that much. So it's a kind of a subtle shift.","Turner Classic Movies begins month-long Latino Images in Film festival .

"Washington (CNN) -- By now, top aides to President Barack Obama, like Dan Pfeiffer, have learned to just tune out the round-the-clock punditry that tends to build up every speech by this commander-in-chief as the pivotal moment in his presidency. The phrase ""stakes are high"" has been used so many times for speeches about anything from health care, to the tragedy in Tucson, Arizona, to the war in Libya, that the White House communications director has voted with his remote control. ""My TV is off,"" Pfeiffer said Wednesday, pointing up at the blank flat screen in his West Wing office. ""If you worried about Washington expectation-setting, you'd never get anything done."" And yet here we go again with soaring expectations for Obama's Thursday speech about U.S. policy in the Mideast -- though it's worth noting the president himself brings on some of the attention by trying to pull so much into one address. As Pfeiffer told me, the president's goal in delivering this speech is to ""take it from the Arab Spring through Libya and on to (Osama) bin Laden and put it in context for everyone."" Whoa, that's a lot to chew on in one speech. Then throw in a section about the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian peace process -- plus attention-getting White House meetings with King Abdullah II of Jordan on Tuesday and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday -- and now perhaps you can see why expectations have gotten a bit out of control. Obama to lay out post-Arab Spring vision . And let's not forget that it was the president who framed this whole issue in such sweeping terms when he went to Cairo in 2009 to deliver the first-ever ""speech to the Muslim world"" by a U.S. president. ""I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world,"" he said then. ""One based upon mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in competition."" Two years later, the Muslim world is still skeptical -- and the region is a tinderbox despite Obama's victory of tracking down bin Laden and finally bringing him to justice. Obama's do-over on the Middle East . Sure, people in places like Egypt and Tunisia have gotten their first tastes of freedom. But the road to democracy is far from certain, and the economic inequities at the root of the original peaceful protests have not gone away. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is cracking down on peaceful protests in his own country, and a Libyan dictator is still dug in after weeks of NATO military action. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has cut a reconciliation deal with Hamas, considered a terrorist group in the United States. Obama's special Mideast envoy George Mitchell abruptly announced late last week that he's heading for the exit. And while Netanyahu is signaling he may be willing to give up more territory on the West Bank to jump-start peace negotiations, his past unwillingness to compromise raises questions about whether this is a sincere bid for peace or just a gambit to show up the Palestinians. Oh yeah -- and while all of this has been happening, Iran has still been trying to get nuclear weapons, officials believe. Other than that, American interests in the region are in fine shape. Enter Obama, who has an opportunity to make some sense of the tumult of the last few months and lay out a clear vision of what the United States can specifically do to help along some of these fledgling democracies. As White House spokesman Jay Carney noted this week, the pace of change has been ""more in five months than we've seen in 50 years in many ways in the region."" Nevertheless, nobody should be so delusional as to think the president can solve all of these major problems with one speech at the State Department. But maybe this can be a turning point, and here are four keys to the speech that will determine its effectiveness in the months ahead: . ECONOMIC AID . Obama is laying out a specific economic aid plan that includes about $2 billion for Egypt as the United States seeks to help get at the root cause of so much of the upheaval in the Mideast. The protests were not just about human rights, they were about the hunger of millions of young Arabs who are simply looking for a job. Some close observers are already dubbing this a Middle Eastern Marshall Plan -- a notion that administration officials are not knocking down -- but whether this will really have as much of an impact as George Marshall's efforts to rebuild Europe after World War II remains to be seen. BIN LADEN . While it's indisputable that taking out such a dangerous terrorist was a positive development, the White House is going to have to be careful not to oversell the killing as the moment that somehow magically solves the region's many challenges. One of Obama's top aides said before the speech that after ""having taken out Osama bin Laden"" while also winding down the war in Iraq, ""we are beginning to turn the page to a more positive and hopeful future for U.S. policy in the region."" There's no question that bin Laden's death is a reminder to young Muslims that there's a better way than blindly following al Qaeda. But whether the United States can translate that into future policy successes is still a question mark. ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE . People inside and outside the administration reading the tea leaves on Mitchell's exit from the peace process note that he was one of the people pushing for a specific Obama plan to try and bring a game-changer to the talks. Mitchell's departure foreshadowed the fact that Obama's speech would not give many new specific details from the president, which is why the real moment to watch will be Friday when Obama and Netanyahu sit down at the White House. Everyone will be watching the body language and looking for some give from either side. But former Mideast peace negotiator Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow Wilson Center warns that nobody should get too hopeful. ""You are going to have the optic of a 'Yes We Can' president on the peace process squaring off in a way against a 'No You Won't' Israeli prime minister,"" Miller said in an interview. SYRIA . The Obama administration's decision on Wednesday to announce tough new sanctions aimed directly at Assad himself justifiably got lots of attention. After all, it was timed to tee up the president's speech and inoculate him against criticism that the United States has been too timid in taking on the Syrian government. But perhaps the more noteworthy development was the sudden push by Obama officials to call for a ""transition"" to democracy in Syria, code for ""It's time for Assad to go."" This is important because it's readily apparent Assad is not going gently into the night. As one person with close ties to the region warned privately this week, ""It's going to be very bloody"" before it gets better -- a chilling reminder that for all of the hopeful talk of an Arab Spring, Miller noted that this could quickly become the ""Arab Winter.""","Soaring expectations precede Obama's speech .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Hollywood should apologize to Iran for ""insults and accusations against the Iranian nation,"" a top aide to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a visiting Hollywood delegation Sunday. ""The Wrestler,"" starring Mickey Rourke was also attacked for being insulting towards Iran. Oscar-nominated ""American Beauty"" star Annette Bening was among the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to hear the remarks, Iran's state-run ISNA news agency said. ""Representatives of Iran's film industry should only have an official meeting with representatives of the Academy and Hollywood if they apologize for the insults and accusations against the Iranian nation during the past 30 years,"" said Javad Shamghadri, Ahmadinejad's advisor on the arts, ISNA reported. He singled out the 1991 Sally Field thriller ""Not Without My Daughter,"" about an American woman who marries an Iranian and then tries to flee Iran with their child, and the comic-book-inspired action flick ""300"" as ""two clear examples of total lies."" Do you think an apology is warranted? TheHollywood delegation, which ISNA said also includes AMPAS president Sid Ganis, is supposed to meet with Iranian filmmakers and hold a news conference on March 7. The Academy did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. But Shamghadri demanded to know how the meetings could produce results. ""How can we sit and have a sincere meeting with American film makers while they they humiliate and insult the Iranian people and the great revolution of this nation?"" he asked, ISNA reported. ""The Iranian nation and its revolution has repeatedly and undeservedly been attacked by Hollywood movies,"" he said. ""The film ""The Wrestler"" is the latest among them,"" he said of the film for which Mickey Rourke received an Oscar nomination this year. ""We know that even right now there are other films being made with the aim of insulting and accusing the great nation of Iran and its rich culture.""

"(CNN) -- The AMC series ""Mad Men"" has been honored for its sharp writing, polished acting and engaging portrayal of life at a New York advertising agency in the early 1960s. ""Mad Men"" has gotten attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. It has also been much noticed for something else: its fashion sense. The series, which features all the looks of that era -- thin-lapeled suits and skinny ties, crinoline-puffed dresses and pencil skirts, Peter Pan collars and subdued pinks and greens -- has attracted attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. Banana Republic, which has placed ""Mad Men""-inspired clothes in its window displays, is even offering a walk-on role for the winner of a contest. ""Mad Men,"" which returns for its third season Sunday, isn't the first Hollywood creation to influence fashion trends. For decades, movies and television shows have played a primary role in dictating people's fashion choices, whether they've been aware of it or not. Here are a few examples. 1. In the 1934 film ""It Happened One Night,"" star Clark Gable took off his shirt and showed his bare chest, instead of the standard white undershirt. For decades, an urban legend has maintained that undershirt sales dropped up to 75 percent, not to recover until World War II. Though the mythbusting site Snopes.com says the truth is uncertain, it's testimony to the legend's strength that we're still talking about it 75 years later. 2. The 1967 film ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" with its (somewhat idealized) Depression-era fashion, continues to inspire today's designers. Faye Dunaway's berets, scarves, trench coats, fitted cardigans and long pencil skirts were a hit at the time and remain so today. 3. ""Annie Hall"" boldly showed women that the masculine preppy look was attractive. Star Diane Keaton wore baggy pants, dress shirts, a vest and tie in the 1977 Woody Allen film. The film is said to have influenced a spike in tie sales for women. 4. ""Saturday Night Fever"" rejuvenated a fading disco craze in 1977 and told men it's OK to wear crotch-hugging pants, wide-open, chest-baring shirts and large medallion jewelry. John Travolta's white polyester suit -- later bought by film critic Gene Siskel at auction -- became a disco-era icon. 5. The 1983 film ""Flashdance"" made active wear -- like a ripped sweatshirt off one shoulder, tight leggings and leg warmers -- sexy for women in the early 1980s. Actor Jennifer Beals is said to have cut the collar off a sweatshirt that had shrunk in order to get it over her head, according to the Internet Movie Database. 6. The 1980s TV series ""Miami Vice,"" with its lightweight fabrics and pastel colors, proved a hit on television and in menswear departments. Star Don Johnson's signature look -- T-shirt, suit jacket, linen pants and shoes worn sockless -- could be seen all over the country. (He also popularized the unshaven, stubble-bearded look.) 7. ""Sex and the City"" trendsetter Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie, talked about her shoe addiction constantly during the HBO series, which ran from 1998 to 2004 and spawned a 2008 movie. Soon, stilettos -- paired with a thrown-together look -- became something the cool crowd of viewers would follow, along with brands such as Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo. 8. A game show starting a fashion trend? It happened with ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" which featured host Regis Philbin sporting a monochromatic shirt-and-tie look. Later, he launched a line of shirts and ties in the Regis by Van Heusen collection.","""Mad Men"" has influenced fashion designers; looks filter into public view .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Muqtada al-Sadr, the Iraqi Shiite cleric who has been staunchly opposed to the American troop presence in his country since the occupation began last decade, warned against the prospects of a ""challenge"" with any U.S. forces that stay in Iraq. ""Go forth from our holy land and go back to your families who are waiting for you impatiently, that you and we, as well, lead a peaceful life together,"" said al-Sadr on Tuesday. His Mehdi army militia was a major factor in the sectarian violence that erupted during the height of the war. Al-Sadr issued his statement as Iraq decides whether to request that some of the 47,000 or so troops in Iraq stay beyond a January 1, 2012, deadline agreed upon between the two countries. But Iraqi leaders have agreed that the government will begin talking with U.S. officials about leaving U.S. forces inside Iraq on a training mission. ""All political leaders have agreed on the U.S training mission in Iraq except the Sadrists, who have some reservations,"" President Jalal Talabani told reporters. That's unacceptable to al-Sadr, who issued his remarks ""on the basis of the logic of common humanity, in the name of a country in which you have made an incursion for years."" ""Enough of this occupation, terror and abuse. We are not in need of your help. We are able to combat and defeat terrorism, and achieve unity. We are not in need of your bases, your experience and etc."" al-Sadr said. ""Go forth,"" he said, ""that we may not enter into a challenge with you or your trainers."" Since 2003, al-Sadr has had the support of tens of thousands of Shiites, especially the young and impoverished in Baghdad's slums and the Shiite south. His Mehdi Army has been considered one of Iraq's most formidable private armies after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Al-Sadr suspended most of its activities in 2007 and 2008, which dramatically reduced violence in Iraq. In 2008, al-Sadr announced that most of the militia members would be transitioned into a socio-cultural organization to oppose secularism and Western thought. But Al-Sadr has ratcheted his anti-American rhetoric up in recent months, raising concerns about an increase in violence as Iraq weighs an extension to the U.S. presence. An increase in attacks in recent months against American troops has been blamed on Shiite militias, including the Promised Day Brigade. The U.S. military says the militia is using the bombings to try to take credit for driving forces out of the country. The U.S. military maintains that the Promised Day Brigade and other Shiite militias are backed by Iran, a charge Tehran has long denied. The cleric, who recently returned to Iraq from three years of self-imposed exile, has transformed himself from the leader of the Mehdi Army to a political player. His political bloc has now joined forces with a former rival, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The al-Sadr movement emerged as one of the kingmakers in Iraqi politics last year when it won 39 parliamentary seats.","Muqtada al-Sadr issues letter to American troops .

"Midland City, Alabama (CNN) -- As far as birthday milestones go, 6 isn't an age that gets the kind of enthusiastic treatment that parents reserve for when a child turns 1 or comes of age at 12. But Ethan turned 6 on Wednesday after surviving an unimaginable ordeal, and Midland City, Alabama, wanted to make sure it was a birthday worth remembering. And he likely will remember it for a long time, according to Sheriff Wally Olson, who visited with the boy and his mother. ""He's been with his family. He played with some toys,"" Olson said Wednesday afternoon. ""He had a large time."" Ethan also saw the overwhelming support from his tiny community and from the world. The city had planned a vigil at Napier Field Town Hall on Tuesday night, but after Ethan was rescued it turned into a celebration. There, children signed an oversized card. ""Happy 6th Birthday Ethan,"" it said. More than 1,200 other cards came in from across the nation, said Philip Parker, principal of Midland City Elementary. Inside the bunker: From storm shelter to boy's prison . The community started an online campaign to raise $7,000 to send the boy and his family to Disney World. ""It grew wings overnight,"" said Anna Owen, one of the organizers. Owen said more than $8,200 was raised by Wednesday afternoon. ""It makes me proud. People just totally want to help. From London to Dothan, it's been overwhelming,"" she said. The city is planning a massive birthday party and is trying to find a place large enough to hold it. While the party wasn't ready Wednesday, many are leaning toward a high school football stadium. Such is the joy in this small town of 2,300 knowing that Ethan won't have to waste his birthday wish hoping to be freed from a dark, underground chamber. He was freed Monday after being hostage underground for six days. Seeing her son again, said Ethan's mother, was ""the most beautiful sight."" But even as the youngster blows out his candles and the south Alabama town plans a celebration, agents will continue combing through the crime scene at Private Road 1539. After being kidnapped, the recovery ahead . The bombs . Two bombs were discovered Tuesday inside that bunker where an FBI team rescued the 5-year-old boy from his kidnaper, Jimmy Lee Dykes, authorities said. One was in the bunker and another was in the PVC pipe that Dykes sometimes used to communicate with the authorities during the 6-day hostage standoff, the FBI said. Knowing Dykes had already shot and killed bus driver Charles Poland, and dragged the boy into the underground bunker, authorities feverishly tried to negotiate with him. Before storming the bunker, negotiators had tried many avenues with no success. Dykes was contentious with authorities from the beginning and throughout the standoff, but the conversations deteriorated rapidly toward the end. Law enforcement officers were able to see what was going on inside the bunker with a camera they slipped into the hideout, a law enforcement official said. FBI sources said surveillance drones constantly monitored the situation. The FBI hostage rescue team practiced on a nearby mockup of the bunker until Dykes' declining mental state forced it to storm the bunker, law enforcement sources said. The assault Monday afternoon came from the top of the bunker, a law enforcement source said, and left Dykes with multiple gunshot wounds. The discovery of the bombs later seemed to further illustrate the danger Ethan faced. Olson said the bunker will be destroyed once all evidence has been collected. ""This has been a terrible tragedy for this community and I'd hate to see this happen again. No one should see this place,"" he said. Support crucial for kids after trauma . The reunion . Ethan was reunited with his mother, who has not been publicly named, at a hospital Tuesday. The grateful mother released a statement describing the reunion. ""I can't describe how incredible it is to hold him again,"" she said. ""Ethan is safe and back in my arms -- and I owe it all to some of the most compassionate people on Earth."" His classmates can't wait to see him, said Parker, the principal. ""We are just looking forward to the time that he can come back in and we can wrap our arms around him and tell him we love him,"" he said. Another person grateful was Aaron Poland, whose father was killed trying to protect Ethan and 21 other children on the school bus. Ethan's made him feel like his dad's final route was finished, Aaron Poland said. ""Ethan was home with his mom. Safe,"" he said. ""My dad's key job was to make sure that every child was delivered safely to their parents."" How our children will recover . CNN's Martin Savidge reported from Midland City; Lateef Mungin reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Marylynn Ryan, Victor Blackwell, Carol Cratty, Vivian Kuo, Rich Phillips, Larry Shaughnessy, Barbara Starr, Michael Pearson, Steve Almasy and HLN law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks also contributed to this report.","NEW: Sheriff says boy had 'large time' on his birthday .

"(CNN) -- ""American Idol"" revealed its top 10 last night, but after the lights dimmed on the live show, the new crop of contestants and the judges had a chance to speak to the press about the big night and preview the competition to come. So what did we learn? Here are some highlights: . 1. Keith Urban thinks Lazaro could upset the Year of the Girl . Since the early audition rounds, producers and judges have said the girls have a strong chance of breaking the male-winner streak. But while Keith Urban notes the strength of the female lot, he's not counting out the boys, especially Lazaro Arbos. ""There are some really good girls singers, but when you see a guy like Burnell [Taylor] or even more so Lazaro and the way he connects with an audience — he comes out and sings and they go crazy. They love him and the votes have really reflected that,"" Urban told reporters. So could Arbos be the one to upset what's been referred to by some as the Year of the Girls? ""He certainly could be,"" says Urban. ""But I love that there's a few in here who could do that if they get the right song and the stars line up. The timing is everything. I hate that [that's the case] for them. It's like — you might be the best football team ever, but if you don't have the game on Super Bowl day that you need, you don't win. But you could [have] won the day before if you'd played the day before. This show is like that."" Meanwhile, Arbos admits that his ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" performance may have not been his best showing: ""Yeah, I was a hot mess with my song tonight. I didn't get a chance to rehearse it. Therefore, I walked on stage and found out I have to sing, I was like, 'Oh My God! Uh-Oh.' So from now on, I just want to get comfortable with performing."" 'American Idol': Here's your Top 10 . 2. That reveal was awkward for the contestants, too. EW recapper Annie Barrett wasn't a fan of the awkwardly formatted top 10 reveal show, saying it lacked suspense and tension for the home audience. But backstage, the biggest problem was an overload of emotions. ""I think that was the ugliest walk I've ever made because I was in the middle of crying and laughing and just thinking of what's going on back home right now,"" Amber Holcomb joked. ""But it was great."" Spanish-speaking singer Devin Velez also admitted to being a little overwhelmed after the big moment. ""I got a little woozy, and Ryan had to shake me, 'Devin, Devin, you have to go on stage.' And the moment the doors open on stage, I just walked out, and I had to put my face in my hands. I just couldn't look. It was unbelievable that all those people were clapping for me because they voted for me,"" he said. ""It was just confirmation of, 'Devin, you're here to sing. You were born to sing. We need you to do this.' So it was like, 'Alright. I have to do it now.'"" 3. A change will do you good . Speaking of Velez, who has made it a point to show off his Spanish skills during his performances thus far, he's going to skip the Spanish twist next week in an effort to keep his offerings fresh. ""I'm not going to make it predictable; I want to catch them by surprise. If you make it predictable, you will get voted off. But I definitely think there will be more coming, just not right now. We're going to take a break,"" he said. ""I might [eventually] do a whole Spanish song, too, but I don't know yet. It's all up in the air right now."" Spielberg, Lucas, Scorsese in 'Milius' 4. Even contestants fear the Nicki . Minaj's side eyes aren't the only scary thing about this season of American Idol. As contestants prepare to head into the more intense rounds of competition, Minaj's razor-sharp tongue and bluntness have some of them sweating. ""She's always so honest — but it's so necessary,"" Burnell Taylor told us, after confessing Minaj was the judge whose critiques he's most fearing. ""I can always count on her when it comes to honesty."" Country singer Janelle Arthur echoed the statement, saying despite being Minaj's beloved ""Marshmallow,"" she doesn't consider herself safe. ""Even though I know Nicki loves me, I always know that she's looking for that certain thing that makes her love me. So when she doesn't see it, I know she's going to bring it up and she's going to say, 'What happened? I didn't see what I wanted to see,'"" said Arthur. ""She's also so unpredictable. I never know what she's going to do. So, yeah, I'm probably most apprehensive about her."" 5. Just Say No... to Carrie . While we're talking about Arthur, it's worth bringing up that this blond country singer is well aware of the comparisons being drawn to that other blonde country singer from Idol, and while flattering, she said she has no plans to cover a Carrie Underwood song. ""I'm trying to stay as far away from the Carrie Underwood songs as I can because Carrie is incredible,"" she said. ""I don't want to be compared to Carrie — but of course I'm going to be because I'm blonde and country. But our styles are so different, and that's the good thing about it. Hopefully Nashville has room for another blonde."" One blonde singer's music she definitely wants a chance to tackle, however? ""I hope to perform a Dolly Parton song at some point,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Ireland has formally requested substantial ""financial assistance"" from the European Union and International Monetary Fund to buttress the government and bolster its struggling banking sector, Prime Minister Brian Cowen said Sunday night. ""I want to assure the Irish people that we have a better future before us,"" Cowen said in announcing the request, as well as pledging substantial budget cuts and tax hikes. European Union financial ministers said they would ""welcome the request,"" according to a joint statement issued soon after Cowen's announcement. Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said his European colleagues agreed to take on the request and start negotiations in a teleconference earlier in the day. ""Ministers concur with the (European) Commission and the European Central Bank that providing assistance to Ireland is warranted to safeguard financial ability in the EU and in the euro area,"" the EU statement said. The central bank's governing council likewise embraced the request, saying in a statement that a loan deal ""will contribute to ensuring the stability of the Irish banking system and permit it to perform its role in the functioning of the economy."" And IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, in a press release, that the international finance institution ""stands ready to join this effort, including through a multi-year loan."" In addition to EU and IMF assistance, Cowen said the United Kingdom and Sweden have agreed to consider giving their own loans to Ireland. Dublin had long publicly insisted it would not seek an external bailout, despite widespread concerns that a ballooning budget deficit and wobbly banking sector would further cripple the Irish economy. Yet a possible loan package was front-and-center during talks this week of European financial ministers. And officials from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF have been meeting officials from Ireland's Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency since Thursday, hashing out measures required to bring stability to the Irish banking system. Those negotiations now continue to determine the extent and guidelines for any aid package, according to Cowen, who said he expects a deal to be finalized ""in the next few weeks."" At Sunday night's press conference in Dublin, which followed a meeting of Cowen's cabinet, Lenihan said the country would ask for less than 100 billion euros from the EU and the IMF. Last May, those two bodies bailed Greece out to the tune of 110 billion euros (currently $150 billion). Cowen said that the government planned to cut 6 billion euros before it wraps its current budgetary cycle on December 7, and planned to eliminate a total of 15 billion euros over the next four years. ""These targets already have the support of European (financial) ministers,"" the prime minister said. ""These (cuts) will be difficult for everyone."" In part to meet its loan requirements, Dublin also will set out a comprehensive four-year plan detailing its deficit-reduction and other measures to shore up the Irish economy, according to Cowen. He said that while corporate tax rates would stay unchanged, income tax levels would rise to 2006 levels. In addition, Cowen said he'd push new policies that would make Irish banks ""significantly smaller than they have been in the past ... so they can be brought on their feet."" Ireland shares the euro with 15 other European nations, and its perilous financial situations has raised concerns about a trickle-down effect on the common currency and the wider European Union. Responding to questions that a large outside loan might threaten Ireland's sovereignty, Cowen said the Ireland's economy was already tightly tied into Europe's and said ""support ... from our partners"" encouraged him to support asking for their assistance. ""Our membership in the EU has transformed our country for the better,"" the prime minister said. ""(But) the task of rebuilding our economy falls to our own ... people."" The money is required to stave off the collapse of Irish banks, which have seen a major outflow of funds over the last year, the Irish government said Sunday. International loans would act as a contingency fund, Lenihan said earlier Sunday, suggesting the mere fact that the funds were available might make it possible for Irish banks to borrow money on the open market again. The Irish government already has pumped billions of euros into Irish banks to keep them afloat, effectively nationalizing most of them. The European Central Bank is lending money to Irish banks because other banks won't. One analyst said Ireland has no choice now but to accept outside money. ""In actual fact Ireland as a country, in financial markets, has no reputation now. We've got to rebuild it, and the reason you rebuild it -- or how you rebuild it -- is you rebuild your balance sheet,"" author and economist David McWilliams told CNN. ""The situation is, if there is no money, we can't pay. And there is no money. That's why the IMF are here. If we had money, they wouldn't be here."" Journalist Peter Taggart and CNN's Jim Boulden and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","NEW: IMF, EU ministers ""welcome"" Ireland's request for financial assistance .

"(CNN) -- Mount Rainier National Park reopened to the public Saturday for the first time since Ranger Margaret Anderson was shot to death on New Year's Day. All services at the park were available expect for ""snowplay."" Anderson was the direct supervisor of the rangers there, and many on that crew -- and elsewhere in the park -- needed more time before returning to work, said park spokesman Charles Beall. ""This tragedy has pretty much affected every employee at the park,"" he said. Authorities believe Anderson, 34, was killed by Benjamin Colton Barnes, a former soldier whose body was found face down in a creek, not far from where he allegedly shot Anderson. Investigators say Barnes shot the ranger after he blew through a checkpoint set up to check vehicles to make sure they had the proper winter gear necessary to travel the park. Anderson and another ranger had set up a second roadblock to stop him when he jumped out of the car and opened fire. She was struck before she was able to get out of her vehicle, authorities said. Anderson was the first Rainier park employee to be a homicide victim. The last ranger fatalities reported at the park were in 1995 when two climbing rangers died during a rescue. Areas within the park have been set up to celebrate Anderson's life and provide a space for staff and visitors to leave condolences and flowers. She was the mother of two young girls. ""It hurt to open the park up again,"" park spokesman Kevin Bacher told CNN affiliate KOMO in Seattle. ""It's part of letting go of Margaret. It's part of our grieving.""

"(CNN) -- The organization overseeing money raised to aid victims of the theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, and their families responded Thursday to criticism from some victims' relatives that their calls to help decide how to spend it were being ignored. ""Every penny collected will go to meeting the direct needs and the future needs of the victims and their families,"" said Marla Williams, the chief executive of Community First Foundation, which oversees the relief fund. At least $5 million has been donated to the Aurora Victims Relief Fund since it was established with the approval of Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to help families of the 12 killed and 58 wounded. The governor chose the Community First Foundation to oversee the relief fund. On Tuesday, Tom Teves, the father of shooting victim Alex Teves, said that ""people who were in the theater, together with those who have lost loved ones"" should be driving decisions about how the money raised is spent. At a news conference in Denver, Teves led a group he said represented 11 of the 12 people who died in the July 20 shooting. ""We're certain that everyone who donated their hard-earned wages intended for 100% of the donations to go directly to the victims and then each family affected would use those funds for what they most needed to help their healing process,"" Teves said. ""Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case."" But Williams said Thursday the foundation was trying to manage the fund ""in a way that we can account for all the money."" She told CNN sister network HLN that it would take 30 to 45 days to determine how best to help the victims and their families. The organizations involved are committed not to take any fee from the funds, she said. The foundation is working with a community committee, the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance, also known as COVA. COVA sent checks for $5,000 to each of the 70 victims' families on August 17, but Chantel Blunk, whose husband, Jonathan Blunk, was among the dead, said the money was not enough to help her deal with the trauma to her son and daughter, ages 2 and 4. When she asked COVA to buy a plane ticket for her daughter Haley to travel from Reno, Nevada, to Denver, ""They told me no,"" Blunk said. ""They're like, 'There's no more funding and we can't help you.'"" In a statement on its website, COVA said ""100% of donations made to COVA in the aftermath of the Aurora shooting are going directly to the victims. COVA has been able to assist victims and their families with costs such as airfare, rental cars and emergency fund situations because of the generosity of people from around the nation."" The families demand ""a robust voice"" on the committee that decides where the money goes, Teves said. Cheryl Haggstrom, Community First Foundation executive vice president, said Tuesday that there had been a conversation about adding family representatives to the committee. Hickenlooper's spokesman, Eric Brown, said Tuesday that his office was working to ""improve communication and the ongoing distribution of assistance."" ""Everyone involved is trying to do the right thing in a very difficult situation,"" Brown said. ""We understand the frustration shared today by victims' families. That's why we have been advocating for them to have a greater voice in the process."" Family representatives will meet with the relief funds committee on Friday, Brown said. CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.","At least $5 million has been donated to the Aurora Victims Relief Fund .

"(CNN) -- The European Court of Human Rights condemned Ireland's laws on abortion Thursday, ruling the country violated the human rights of a woman forced to go abroad to end her pregnancy. It did not, however, recommend a change to Irish law, which prohibits abortion in all cases. The woman, a Lithuanian national who was not named, was in remission from a rare form of cancer and unaware she was pregnant when she had a series of check-ups that are not advised during pregnancy, the court said. She felt the pregnancy would cause a relapse of her cancer and was also concerned about the health of the fetus if she continued to term. She claimed she could not obtain clear advice about her options, so she decided in 2005 to have an abortion in England. The woman said she suffered medical complications on her return to Ireland. Having an abortion in Ireland carries a penalty of life imprisonment. Women in Ireland are permitted to travel abroad for abortions and obtain information about their options for doing so. The Irish Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that abortion is lawful in Ireland if there is a risk to the mother's life, but the Irish Parliament has never passed a law guaranteeing that right. The European court, located in Strasbourg, France, ruled that, by failing to allow the woman to have a lawful abortion in Ireland, the country violated her right to respect for her physical and psychological integrity, which falls under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. At the same time, the court ruled Article 8 cannot be interpreted as conferring a right to abortion, which may come as a relief to defenders of the Irish ban. It had been thought a more serious ruling by the court could have challenged the country's laws on abortion. The court ordered Ireland to pay the woman 15,000 euros ($19,800) in damages. While the court condemned the Irish ban, it rejected the complaints of two Irish women who sued along with the Lithuanian national, saying there had been no violation of their human rights. It also dismissed the rest of the Lithuanian woman's complaints, which fell under Articles 2 and 3 of the human rights convention and concerned the right to life and prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment. Proving that her pregnancy posed a risk to her life required the Lithuanian woman to establish it either with her doctor or through the courts. The court said going to her doctor was ""ineffective,"" however, because the criminality of abortion posed a ""significant chilling factor"" in any discussions about it. ""They both ran a risk of a serious criminal conviction and imprisonment if an initial doctor's opinion that abortion was an option, as it posed a risk to the woman's health, was later found to be against the Irish constitution,"" the court found. ""Ireland's failure to legislate to protect the rights of women has been clearly exposed by the European Court of Human Rights today,"" said Mark Kelly, director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, in a statement. ""It is imperative that the government legislate swiftly to ensure that women are able to exercise their existing Constitutional rights. ""Yet again, it has required international intervention to remind our legislature of their domestic responsibilities,"" said Kelly, who is in Washington attending a global civil rights leaders meeting. ""If Ireland wishes to reassert its sovereignty and its standing in the international community, it must start by fully respecting the human rights of people at home."" Irish Health Minister Mary Harney said in a statement Thursday that the government will have to legislate on the issue in the wake of the court's ruling. The government ""will have to come forward with proposals, but it will take time,"" Harney said in an interview, according to the Irish government's website. She added it was a ""highly complex area,"" but said she felt the ruling was a ""binding judgment."" The Irish government argued the woman should have tried to go through the Irish court system to prove her pregnancy was a risk to her life, but the court said that would have been ineffective because it would be ""inappropriate"" to ask a woman to go through complex constitutional proceedings if her life was at risk. The constitutional courts are also not able to determine whether a woman qualifies for a lawful abortion, the court said. Neither avenue, therefore, allowed the woman effective and accessible ways to establish her right to a lawful abortion in Ireland, the court said. The court also lamented the fact that a woman's right to an abortion in Ireland if her health is at risk has never been put into law. Human Rights Watch praised the ruling as a ""wake-up call to the Irish government"" to regulate access to abortion. ""This morning the European Court established that this is not just tragic, it is a violation of human rights. And it must end now,"" said Marianne Mollmann, women's rights advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. A January 2010 report from the human rights group says Irish women face financial, logistical, physical, and emotional burdens imposed by the laws of Ireland that force them to seek abortions abroad, without support from the state. The three women who brought the case in Strasbourg had personally suffered these ordeals, the group said. ""It is time for the government to end their ostrich mentality regarding abortion and start delivering on women's human rights,"" Mollmann said.","The European Court of Human Rights rules the ban violated a woman's human rights .

I better admit from the start I never saw Dan Curtis' spooky ""Dark Shadows"" soap opera, a curio that ran from 1966 to 1971. The belated blockbuster edition arrives courtesy of director Tim Burton, star Depp and ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" scribe Seth Grahame-Smith, a mash-up monster squad possibly more inclined to camp than Curtis was, and certainly more tickled by the nostalgic ""modernity"" of the Nixon era. The fruit of their labors is mostly weirdly amusing -- when it's not just plain bemusing -- but hardly the wacky parody the trailers suggest. And it falls well short of satire. The gags are there alright, but so is the soap in roughly equal measure. Always stronger on gothic atmosphere than story, Burton dedicates unwarranted screentime to the Collins' dull fortunes in the fish canning business (I'm not kidding). More promisingly, he dishes up tortured romance more or less straight -- or as straight as a romantic triangle between an angry witch, a lovelorn vampire and a corpse is ever likely to be -- and smuggles at least a smidgeon of heartfelt emotional baggage into the spectacularly dysfunctional dynamics of the Collins clan. As we know by now, in Burton's films being a misfit is a mark of distinction. And if Depp's Barnabas is by his own admission an accursed monster with buckets of blood on his hands, he's more or less absolved of moral guilt, redeemed by his loyalty, integrity and commitment to the family. On top of which, Depp is fun. He's a vision in monochrome with his pasty complexion, black cape and hair. His elongated fingers weave mesmerizing dainty webs in thin air, and he pounces on each and every syllable of ripe 18th century rhetoric for maximum pomp. But scratch the surface and this turns out to be another arch, hollow turn from an actor who seems to treat his roles like extended party pieces, sniffing out any excuse for vaudeville and hang the consequences. His Barnabas is the life of the party but impossible to take seriously as a tormented soul. Despite his protestations, there is precious little heat between him and his beloved, Victoria (an intriguingly wan Bella Heathcote). If you can't join him, beat him: that seems to be Eva Green's game, effectively out-vamping Depp as Barnabas' spurned lover and nemesis, brittle, randy sorceress Angelique. Also preening for attention but given rather less to play is Michelle Pfeiffer -- who must have thought she was back in Eastwick -- as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, the de facto head of the family, Helena Bonham Carter Burton as dypso head-doctor Julia Hoffman and Chloe Grace Moretz as Elizabeth's very adolescent daughter Caroline. Then there is Alice Cooper as plain old Alice Cooper. They're all troupers, but step back a moment, you might feel a bit queasy about a picture that shrugs off multiple murders and vilifies an abused housemaid who rebels against the old European social hierarchies. Unfortunately, Burton and Depp's ironic, detached treatment invites just that kind of idle reflection. The architecture looks grand, but the foundations are shaky.","""Dark Shadows"" is based on Dan Curtis' spooky soap opera of the same name .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An American soldier went on a house-to-house shooting spree in two villages in southern Afghanistan early Sunday, Afghan officials said, killing 16 people in what Afghanistan's president called an ""unforgivable"" crime. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the soldier acted alone and turned himself in after opening fire on civilians. U.S. President Barack Obama called the killings ""tragic and shocking,"" and offered his condolences to the Afghan people in a phone call to his counterpart in Kabul, Hamid Karzai, the White House said. But the attack is likely to further more anger at international forces following deadly riots over the burning of Qurans by U.S. troops. ""The Afghan people can withstand a lot of pain,"" Prince Ali Seraj, the head of the National Coalition for Dialogue with the Tribes of Afghanistan, told CNN. ""They can withstand collateral damage. They can withstand night raids. But murder is something that they totally abhor, and when that happens, they really want justice."" In a statement issued by his office, Karzai said the killings took place in the district of Panjwai, about 25 km (15 miles) southwest of Kandahar, southern Afghanistan's major city. Haji Agha Lali, a member of the provincial council, told CNN the soldier had attacked four houses in two nearby villages. ""We call this an intentional act,"" Karzai said. He said the dead included four men, three women and nine children, calling the killings ""acts of terror and unforgivable."" Another five people were wounded, he said. Capt. Justin Brockhoff, an ISAF spokesman, said the wounded Afghans were being treated in ISAF facilities. The allied command did not give its own estimate of casualties. Brockhoff said officials do not yet have a motive for the shooting, which is under investigation by both NATO and Afghan officials. And Maj. Jason Waggoner, another ISAF spokesman, said the soldier ""was acting on his own."" There were no military operations in the area, either on the ground or in the air, at the time, according to two senior ISAF officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. They said only one soldier, an Army staff sergeant, is believed to have been involved. A U.S. military official told CNN later Sunday that the suspect is from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. The official said the soldier is assigned to a Special Forces unit. A third ISAF official said Afghan troops spotted the soldier leaving his combat outpost around 3 a.m. Sunday and notified their American counterparts. The U.S. military did an immediate headcount, found the soldier was missing and dispatched a patrol to go look for him, the official said. The officials said they have no knowledge at this point whether he had any previous medical or mental health issues in his record. The patrol met him as he returned and took him into custody. He said nothing, and it was unclear whether they knew what had happened, the official said. ""We don't know what motivated this individual, and we're not sure where this is going to take us,"" Capt. John Kirby, an ISAF spokesman, told CNN. But he said ISAF's commander, Gen. John Allen, ""has made it clear this investigation is going to be thorough. It's going to be done rapidly, in an expeditious way, and we're going to hold the perpetrator of these attacks to account."" The news brought a wave of condemnations from top American officials. In a statement issued by the White House, Obama said the U.S. military will ""get the facts as quickly as possible and to hold accountable anyone responsible."" White House response to shooting spree . ""I am deeply saddened by the reported killing and wounding of Afghan civilians. I offer my condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives, and to the people of Afghanistan, who have endured too much violence and suffering,"" Obama said. ""This incident is tragic and shocking, and does not represent the exceptional character of our military and the respect that the United States has for the people of Afghanistan."" In a separate statement, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the attack and said the suspect was ""clearly acting outside his chain of command."" Allen called the killings ""deeply appalling,"" and acting U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham said his country was ""saddened by this violent act against our Afghan friends."" ""We deplore any attack by a member of the U.S. Armed Forces against innocent civilians,"" he said in a video statement, assuring ""the people of Afghanistan that the individual or individuals responsible for this terrible act will be identified and brought to justice."" But Seraj, a member of Afghanistan's former royal family, said the killings are likely to play into the hands of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that has battled the U.S.-led coalition for a decade. ""They are really going to milk this for all it's worth,"" Seraj said, adding, ""This is playing right into their program of psychological warfare against the Afghan people."" The Taliban has already said that the deaths were the result of a night raid by several soldiers and put the death toll at 50, but it regularly exaggerates casualty figures. Seraj called for a joint U.S.-Afghan investigation into the killings, saying Afghans will want to see ""quick and decisive justice."" ""We cannot whitewash this and get this young man out of Afghanistan and send him back to the United States. That is the worst thing we can do at this time,"" he said. And he questioned how the soldier left his post in the pre-dawn hours, adding, ""I know the Kandahar base. A fly cannot get in without being searched."" Kandahar and the surrounding region is the home of the Taliban, and eight of the 69 coalition troops killed in Afghanistan so far this year died in the province. But Kirby said the area has been ""a big success story"" for the allied campaign, and he said Allen has made clear that the coalition strategy won't be affected by Sunday's killings. ""As tragic as this incident is, it would be a larger tragedy to affect the mission at large and what we're trying to do for the country,"" he said. ""We're going to continue to be out there among the populace,"" he added. ""We're going to continue to try to beat back this insurgency."" Taliban link attack to Quran burning . The United States and its allies invaded Afghanistan in 2001, following al Qaeda's terrorist attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people. The invasion quickly toppled the Taliban, which ruled most of Afghanistan and had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory. But the militia soon regrouped and launched an insurgent campaign against the allied forces and a new government led by Karzai. The No. 1 U.S. target in the conflict, al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, was killed in a commando raid in neighboring Pakistan in May 2011. American and allied combat troops are scheduled to leave Afghanistan by 2014, and Karzai has been increasingly critical of the allied force. Tensions ramped up dramatically in February, after a group of U.S. soldiers burned copies of the Quran, Islam's holy book, that had been seized from inmates at the American-run prison at Bagram Air Base. American officials from Obama down called the burning an accident and apologized for it, but riots left dozens dead, including six American troops. Hundreds more Afghans were wounded. The war has cost the lives of nearly 1,900 Americans and just under 1,000 more allied troops to date. CNN's Samira Jafari, Claudia Dominguez, Ruhullah Khapalwak, Barbara Starr and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: A military official says the suspect is from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state .

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told ABC's Diane Sawyer this week that Facebook would ""definitely think about"" adding a Dislike button to the site, allowing users to express distaste for updates or pages on Facebook. But Zuckerberg is just humoring us: Facebook will never add a Dislike button, regardless of users' demands. Here's why: . Demand for the dislike button . There's certainly some demand for dislikes. In answer to Sawyer's question on whether a Dislike button would be considered, Zuckerberg replied: ""We listen to all the user suggestions and it's something that we've thought about. You know, people like the Like button so much ... I dunno, it's something that we would definitely think about. People definitely seem to want it."" A Facebook group for the concept has nearly 3.2 million fans, while there are at least two unofficial extensions for the Firefox browser -- FaceMod and Facebook Dislike -- that claim to add a Dislike button for those users who install them. Those clamoring for a ""thumbs down"" option seem to fall into two camps. For some, ""Liking"" tragic news seems inappropriate -- and yet Facebook does offer a ""Share"" option on its own site, while third party sites can opt to use a ""Recommend"" button instead. Others simply want to express distaste for a page or news update -- this is a move Facebook will never make, however, because it doesn't align with the company's interests. The role of the Like button . The Like button serves numerous purposes for Facebook. One obvious benefit is that it lowers the psychological barrier to connecting with commercial entities on the site -- while previously users could ""Become a Fan"" of a brand, they now imply ""Like"" that brand's page, resulting in higher engagement. Another is that it increases clicks for web publishers: Facebook users are more inclined to ""Like"" a news article than they are to hit a ""Share"" button. A third benefit: Facebook aims to connect people who share similar interests. Like buttons result in more connections, which creates more value. Downside of Dislike buttons . A Dislike button provides none of these benefits. In fact it would create significant tension between Facebook, brands, and web publishers. Imagine if Facebook users could not only choose to ""Like"" Coca-Cola, but were also provided the option to ""Dislike"" the brand. Would Facebook become a more appealing place for brands to spend their marketing budgets and ad dollars ... or a less appealing one? Now imagine that websites could add ""Dislike"" buttons to their pages. Would web publishers rush to add this option, desperate for the negative feedback from their visitors? Hardly. And what about Facebook's mission to ""make the world more open and connected""? While Like buttons connect Facebook users to their interests, Dislike buttons serve no such purpose. Like buttons are about connection; Dislike buttons are about division. In short, Facebook will never add a Dislike button because it would damage the company's relationships with brands, businesses and web publishers -- these groups are essential for building both web traffic and ad revenue. Like it or not, Dislike buttons aren't coming to Facebook anytime soon. © 2011 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","A Facebook group for the concept has nearly 3.2 million fans .

"Washington (CNN) -- A preliminary U.S. Navy plan to allow its chaplains to perform same-sex marriages in military chapels after the end of ""don't ask, don't tell"" has fired up congressional opposition. All services are moving forward with the transition from the present ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in uniform. Top Pentagon officials are expected to sign off on the new rules and the progress of training in coming weeks. An April 13 memo from the Navy officer in charge of chaplains says they ""may"" officiate at same-sex marriages or civil unions, depending on both local laws and their religious organization. It is not clear if the other services would have a similar provision. ""Regarding the use of base facilities for same-sex marriages, legal counsel has concluded that, generally speaking, base facility use is sexual orientation-neutral,"" Rear Adm. Mark Tidd, the Navy's chief of chaplains, said in the memo. ""This is a change to previous training that stated same-sex marriages are not authorized on federal property."" After the pending rule change was reported in the Navy Times and Stars and Stripes newspapers, it drew criticism from dozens of members of Congress. A letter from Rep. Todd Akin, R-Missouri, to the secretary of the Navy asking him to block the change has been signed by 63 members of Congress, according to Akin's website. Akin says the Navy's permission for gay weddings in military chapels, once the current policy formally is ended, would violate the federal Defense of Marriage Act. ""While a state may legalize same-sex marriage, federal property and federal employees, like Navy chaplains, should not be used to perform marriages that are not recognized by federal law,"" Akin said on his website. ""My colleagues and I are calling on the secretary of the Navy to make sure that the Navy actually follows the law. As we state in the letter, 'It is not the place of any citizen of this country to pick and choose which laws they are going to obey. We expect citizens sworn to defend those laws to set the example in their application.'"" The Pentagon said in a statement Monday that the Defense of Marriage Act ""does not limit the type of religious ceremonies a chaplain may perform in a chapel on a military installation."" However, while the Defense of Marriage Act still stands, the Defense Department would not recognize those unions as valid marriages even if they're performed in a state that recognizes same-sex marriages. Cmdr. Danny Hernandez, the Navy's assistant chief of information, told CNN that under the same-sex marriage proposal, each chaplain would be bound by his own religious beliefs. ""A chaplain can conduct a same-sex ceremony if it is in the tenets of his faith,"" Hernandez said. And he said the policy would have no impact on military benefits. When Defense Secretary Robert Gates and others announced that the Pentagon would end the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, they made it clear that benefits for spouses and survivors are a complicated issue that would require more study and planning.","A Navy proposal brings a new round of congressional opposition .

"(CNN) -- Big parts are coming off a former U.S. Navy minesweeper that became stuck on a Philippine reef in January. Salvage crews have removed the funnel, or smokestack, and mast from the former USS Guardian, the Philippine coast guard reports. The agency posted a series of photos on its website showing large parts of the minesweeper being lifted by a crane and transferred to a barge. Once the top decks of the ship is cleared and heavy machinery is removed from the inside, the 224-foot-long, fiberglass-and-wood hull of the Guardian is expected to be cut into three parts before it is lifted from the reef. Salvage efforts are expected to continue through most of March, the U.S. Navy said, but adverse weather could increase the time needed. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy said that the Guardian was decommissioned and stricken from the naval registry on February 15. Another minesweeper, the USS Warrior, is being moved to the Pacific to replace the Guardian, the Navy said. That vessel, currently in Bahrain, will be ferried by a heavy transport ship to the U.S. naval base in Sasebo, Japan, where the Guardian's crew will take over its operation, according to a Navy statement. The Guardian grounded on Tubbataha Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage site, on January 17. An investigation of the grounding is ongoing. Navy officials said in January that the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles. The Guardian is estimated to have damaged about 4,000 square meters (about 43,000 square feet) of the reef. The Navy has pledged to clean up the debris created when waves stripped off pieces of fiberglass covering the wooden hull of the ship and to try to restore the reef as much as possible. Philippine officials said last month that the country would seek compensation for reef damage. Harry K. Thomas Jr., the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, has assured the Filipinos that the United States ""will provide appropriate compensation for damage to the reef caused by the ship."" The reef is home to a vast array of sea, air and land creatures as well as sizable lagoons and two coral islands. About 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there, as can whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds, according to UNESCO.","Funnel, mast of minesweeper removed .

"Ottawa (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said Tuesday polls would not change the strategy in Afghanistan, underscoring the fact that he realizes the American people have tired of war. ""We cannot fight wars by polls,"" Panetta said in Ottawa, where he was attending a trilateral defense meeting with Canadian and Mexican officials. Panetta was responding to a new New York Times/CBS poll showing that 69% of Americans want troops out of Afghanistan. ""There's no question that the American people have tired of war just like the Afghan people have tired of war,"" he added before stressing that the U.S. government would continue with its strategy in Afghanistan. ""We have to operate based on what we believe is the best strategy to achieve the mission that we are embarked on. And the mission ... is to safeguard our country by ensuring that the Taliban and al Qaeda never again find a safe haven in Afghanistan,"" Panetta said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby in Washington strongly echoed Panetta's sentiment, saying the military's job is not to be driven by sentiments expressed in polls. When asked the reaction to the poll from Gen. John Allen, the top commander in Afghanistan, Kirby said, ""His concern as a military commander in the field is getting the job done."" In Ottawa, the defense summit was billed as a historic one as the three countries tried to coordinate more security efforts, especially in the area of counternarcotics. As well as embarking on a joint trilateral defense threat assessment, the U.S., Canada and Mexico pledged to do more to confront and combat drug cartels on the continent. ""I think all of us think today has been an important day because I think all of us recognize the importance of dealing with this threat to North America, this threat to security, this threat to our people,"" Panetta said. Officials described a sobering presentation given by Mexican military officials outlining the scope and seriousness of the challenge in bringing drug traffickers and gang members to justice. Specifically, military officials said there would be more time spent on patrolling waters and inspecting things like shipping containers that cross borders. They also said they were working to share more intelligence in a timely manner. ""This very ambitious goal of coordinating our efforts goes beyond any one specific threat,"" Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay said.

"(CNN) -- An Ohio jury Tuesday convicted a 53-year-old man for killing three men who had answered a Craigslist ad for work on a cattle farm. Richard Beasley was found guilty on 26 counts of aggravated murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery and other charges. Jurors will return March 20 to determine if Beasley should receive the death penalty, CNN affiliate WKYC reported. Prosecutors said Beasley was the ""principal offender"" in the murders of three men between August and November 2011. During the trial, prosecutors indicated robbery might have been one possible motive for the killings. The victims -- Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron, Ohio; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Virginia; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon, Ohio -- were found dead in separate shallow graves after responding to an online ad soliciting workers, authorities have said. The investigation into the killings began the night of November 6, 2011, when a Noble County deputy sheriff responded to a call and came upon a ""white, middle-aged man being treated for a gunshot wound to the right arm,"" according to Sheriff Stephen S. Hannum of Noble County. The wounded man -- Scott Davis from South Carolina -- told the law enforcement officer that he had answered an ad on the Craigslist website offering work caring for cattle on a 688-acre property in eastern Ohio before he was shot by Beasley. Brogan Rafferty, 17, of Stow, Ohio, a high school sophomore, was convicted in October on charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder in connection with the killings, CNN affiliate WJW reported.

"(CNN) -- After Adele's (rightly deserved) sweep at the Grammys last year, this year's show is poised to be a bit less predictable. It'll be a boys' club on CBS Sunday with a six-way tie among Mumford & Sons, Frank Ocean, Fun., Kanye West, Jay-Z and the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach for lead nominee, each receiving six nods apiece. 55th annual Grammy Awards: The Nominees List . In between acceptance speeches, the three-and-a-half hour ceremony will be filled with performances from Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Bruno Mars and Sting, the Black Keys, Taylor Swift, Frank Ocean, the Lumineers, Fun., Mumford & Sons, Dierks Bentley and Miranda Lambert, and Jack White. But when it comes down to it, there are only four categories that count as the big fish. Check out some predictions below. Who do you think will win big this weekend? Best new artist . This category is tough to call because it's crowded with possibilities, from industry favorite Frank Ocean to don't-count-'em-out contenders the Lumineers and Fun. The Alabama Shakes and Hunter Hayes also scored nods here, but the prevailing sentiment is that they're in the ""it's just an honor to be nominated"" part of the group. Both the Lumineers and Fun. have a mainstream commercial advantage over Ocean, but the ""Channel Orange"" artist is beloved by critics and has had a meteoric rise this year. It'll be a tight race, but it looks like it's Ocean's prize to take. Record of the year . Remember that this honor extends to the production team in addition to the artist. The contenders here had some of the hottest tracks of the past year: Taylor Swift's ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"" the Black Keys' ""Lonely Boy,"" Kelly Clarkson's ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You),"" Gotye's ""Somebody That I Used to Know,"" Fun.'s ""We Are Young"" and Frank Ocean's ""Thinkin' Bout You."" Ocean and Fun. are again two acts that we'd like to think are frontrunners, but the dominating prediction is that this is really a race between Gotye and the Black Keys. If you go with what's most popular with the listeners of Spotify, Gotye's ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" will be crowned record of the year on Sunday. Still, we're going with ""Lonely Boy."" Song of the year . Here's where the recording academy zeroes in on songwriters, which in this case often overlap with performers. We're looking at ""The A Team"" from Ed Sheeran, ""Adorn"" from Miguel, ""Call Me Maybe"" from Carly Rae Jepsen, ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)"" from Kelly Clarkson and ""We Are Young"" from Fun., with a feature spot from Janelle MonÃ¡e. It's an interesting mix because, as both HitFix and MTV critique, it's a less competitive category than some of the others. Miguel's ""Adorn"" deserves the attention, and there's no denying what a juggernaut of a single ""Call Me Maybe"" continues to be. But from the lay of the land, this is Fun.'s title to lose. Album of the year . It's the biggest honor of the night, and each nominee this year would be a solid choice to win the Grammy. In competition are the Black Keys' ""El Camino,"" Fun.'s ""Some Nights,"" Mumford & Sons' ""Babel,"" Frank Ocean's ""Channel Orange"" and Jack White's ""Blunderbuss."" While White's album was a welcomed surprise to this category, the odds aren't in his favor. Among critics, it's coming down to Frank Ocean, the Black Keys and Mumford, with Fun. being somewhat of an outlier. One theory is that with all of the rockers in competition, they'll cancel each other out and clear a path for Ocean. But with Mumford being the safer bet and a fantastic album to boot, all eyes are on them to win.

"London (CNN) -- Britain has some of the best journalism in the world. A number of institutions with noble traditions -- the London Times, the BBC, the Guardian and others -- foster reporting that challenges vested interests and informs citizens in exactly the way that journalism is supposed to do. But the British press also has deep problems, as the phone-hacking affair and the year-long Leveson inquiry into press ethics and practices have revealed. In recent decades editors and proprietors have made themselves virtually unaccountable for what they do, enabling a culture to develop in which the people who are the subjects of stories may be bullied, lied about or intruded upon at will. It is only a minority of journalists who have done this, but the attitude was cynical and ugly, summed up by a News of the World news editor who remarked to a colleague: ""That is what we do. We go out and destroy other people's lives."" The result was a stream of scandals of which phone hacking was only the latest and the worst, and, though journalists hate to admit it, the whole trade is contaminated. News: Brooks, Coulson charged over alleged payments to officials . The report of the Leveson Inquiry, due later this week, is a historic opportunity to clean things up. In an ideal world journalists would not need the kind of regulation he will recommend, but if trust is to be rebuilt it is essential. It is essential, too, because citizens have to be protected against the kinds of violations that have become common, and that have spread misery and distress. What will it change? The first thing we have to acknowledge is that Leveson can only recommend; it is up to the government, parliament and the industry to implement what he suggests. And the British press has been through crises like this before and usually managed to wriggle off the hook. But this time is probably worse than ever before and the newspapers are less in control of the debate than ever before, so change is indeed possible. The challenge to Lord Justice Leveson was to come up with an effective system of regulation that does not undermine the freedom of journalists to do their work in the public interest. And that surely means calling time on the industry's ""self-regulation,"" now acknowledged as a mere fig-leaf. So there will probably be a new body, in all likelihood backed by statute, with the job of ensuring that newspapers and their websites meet basic standards of accuracy and fairness. Hacked Off, the campaign group of which I am director, hopes that it will be very clearly independent of both political influence and of the editors and proprietors. This is not such a great novelty for Britain, first because for years the press has insisted that its own self-regulation regime existed to uphold standards and provide redress (though it did so only selectively) and second because broadcast journalism is regulated in this way (and broadcast journalism happens to be the country's most trusted). To some, however, it will sound ugly, even offensive. We like to think of journalism as unfettered and rambunctious, and British journalists are apt to quote from John Stuart Mill, or to cite the troublemaking examples of William Cobbett and W. T. Stead, to justify their independence from any kind of vetting or control. Opinion: Why media fights back so hard . But change is now vital because journalism has been inflicting too much damage. Too many innocent, ordinary people -- victims of crime, people bereaved in disasters, innocent acquaintances and relatives of the famous -- have been lied about, intruded upon or had their rights trampled on by newspapers. So Britain has a choice: sacrifice the rights of vulnerable people into the future or try to get the press to observe basic standards. It's not really a choice at all. And the new regulation will not be censorship. Lord Justice Leveson is obliged by his terms of reference to make recommendations that support press freedom and in any case he pledged many times that he was not remotely interested in gagging the newspapers. Instead newspapers will be made accountable, after publication, for their errors and failures. They will have to acknowledge them and give redress to those injured. They will be required to abide by a code of practice and face scrutiny, censure and possibly fines for repeated or grievous breaches. And they will have to do something they have never liked to do: learn from their mistakes. For a journalist -- and I am one -- it is in many ways shaming. But we journalists are the first to demand this kind of remedy in any other walk of life where ethics have broken down, be it banking or policing or medical practice. We must be ready to take the medicine we dish out to others, not least because it can and should make us better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Cathcart.","Phone-hacking revelations revealed problems into UK press, says Brian Cathcart .

"London (CNN) -- Egypt's largest Islamist party, the Muslim Brotherhood, lost its grip on legislative power after the country's highest court declared parliament invalid Thursday. The Brotherhood dominated parliamentary elections in December, winning about half the seats. But Egypt's interim military rulers -- who have long been at odds with the Brotherhood -- declared full legislative authority in the aftermath of the ruling. On Monday, however, the party declared that it its candidate Mohamed Morsi had won 52.5% of the votes in the weekend presidential election, putting the party in a position to reclaim power. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? The Muslim Brotherhood is a religious and political group founded on the belief that Islam is not simply a religion, but a way of life. It advocates a move away from secularism, and a return to the rules of the Quran as a basis for healthy families, communities, and states. The movement officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals. However, offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past, and critics blame the Brotherhood for sparking troubles elsewhere in the Middle East. Many consider it the forerunner of modern militant Islamism. When was it created? The Muslim Brotherhood has been part of the political scene in Egypt for more than 80 years. It was formed there by Hassan al-Banna in 1928. Teacher Al-Banna and his followers were initially united by a desire to oust the British from control in Egypt, and to rid their country of what they saw as ""corrupting"" Western influences. What is its history? In its early years, the group concentrated on religion, education and social services, but as its membership grew, it moved into the political sphere, organizing protests against the Egyptian government. In the 1940s, an armed wing of the Brotherhood was blamed for a string of violent acts, including the assassination of Egyptian Prime Minister Mahmud Fahmi al-Nuqrashi in 1948 -- shortly after he had ordered the dissolution of the MB. Al-Banna himself was assassinated soon afterwards -- his supporters claimed he had been killed on the wishes of the government. The movement went underground in the 1950s, and decades of oppression by successive Egyptian rulers led many of the Brotherhood's members to flee abroad, while others were jailed. The MB grew throughout the 1980s as part of a general growth of interest in Islam, and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 saw a spike in membership. Why is it important in Egypt? The Brotherhood is the oldest and largest opposition group in Egypt. It has widespread support among Egypt's middle classes, and its members control many of the country's professional organizations. Up until last year, it was illegal under Egyptian law banning all parties based on religion. But in December, it dominated parliamentary elections, winning about half of the seats up for grabs. How influential is the Brotherhood elsewhere? There are branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in countries across the Middle East and North and East Africa, including Sudan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. There is also a branch in the U.S. Its offshoots outside Egypt are markedly more conservative in their views: The Kuwaiti branch is said to oppose the right of women to vote. Sayyid Qutb, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and 1960s, developed the doctrine of jihad, and the radical group Hamas is believed to be an offshoot of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood.","Muslim Brotherhood has been part of the political scene in Egypt for more than 80 years .

"Miami (CNN) -- For a war vet from South Florida, a leisurely road trip to a seaside vacation came to an abrupt end in Mexico, where he has languished behind bars for four months, sometimes chained to a bed. For the first few months, Jon Hammar's parents kept his plight out of the public eye, fearing that media attention could bring harm to him in prison. But now they are coming forward, hoping the publicity will push Mexican authorities to act. Hammar, 27, is being held in the border town of Matamoros, just across from Brownsville, Texas. It is notorious as the home of the Gulf Cartel, one of Mexico's major drug trafficking organizations. ""The only reason they were going to stop was to get more gas,"" his father said. Hammar, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Marine, was headed to Costa Rica in August to go surfing with a fellow veteran. He had surfed there before and packed every good surf board he had, his parents said. But he also took one item that quickly became troublesome: an antique shotgun handed down from his great-grandfather. Opinion: A father's plea: End the war on drugs . He intended to hunt with it, his parents said. And he declared it with U.S. border agents. But after he drove his Winnebago a few feet farther to the Mexican side, authorities arrested him, saying the weapon did not comply with their gun laws. ""The crime that he's charged with is possession of a weapon that's restricted for military use,"" said his mother, Olivia Hammar. A branch of the Mexican military has said the gun is not on its ""forbidden list,"" she said. But the former Marine remains incarcerated. Mexican officials said that the files on the case were not immediately available because the arrest happened so long ago. An official at the prosecutor's office declined to comment. A few nights after Hammar's arrest, his parents received the first of several threatening calls from behind bars, they said. ""He said: I have your son,"" Olivia Hammar recalled, tearing up. ""I am going to f--- him up. I already have."" Then she heard her son's voice. ""He said: Mom, you've got to do what they say; they're really serious."" The voice at the other end of the line asked for $1,800. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, stepped in on Hammar's behalf, speaking to Mexico's ambassador to the United States. ""We interceded to get him out of the general prison population,"" Nelson said. This served to remove Hammar from contact with dangerous inmates. The calls have since stopped, his mother said. ""He is now being kept in a low ... intensity place, more like an administrative place,"" Nelson said. But because of the low security of the new facility, which Olivia Hammar describes as a storage shed, officials periodically chain Hammar to his bed. The Hammars recently turned to their U.S. congresswoman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who heads the Committee on Foreign Affairs. ""This is outrageous,"" Ros-Lehtinen said. She has spoken with the State Department and the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, and will meet with the Mexican ambassador to the United States this week. ""Enough is enough,"" she said. ""Jonny, we're going to get you out of there,"" Olivia Hammar said to her son by phone Friday. He reminded her that she has been telling him that since August. Their son returned to them safe and unharmed from Iraq and Afghanistan. Hammar's parents now fear they could lose him just across the border, if they wait too much longer. Mexico says Gulf Cartel boss arrested . CNN's Gary Tuchman reported from Miami and Ben Brumfield wrote from Atlanta.","Jon Hammar is being held in a town dominated by a drug cartel .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Indian police arrested two suspected dealers in black market cell phone chips -- a vendor and a Srinigar police officer -- in the effort to trace how the Mumbai attackers got theirs. An Indian Border Security Force soldier patrols Agartala Airport, Tripura, which is on high alert. Investigators are also taking a closer look at an Indian citizen who was arrested in February with maps and drawings of some of the Mumbai locations attacked last month. The vendor was arrested in Calcutta; the police officer was arrested in Delhi. Indian officials have said the November 26 attacks that killed 179 people in Mumbai were carried out by outsiders, but these developments suggest that investigators are also looking for homegrown terrorist connections. Indian authorities believe that all the attackers were Pakistanis, specifically blaming Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan but also active in Srinigar, the capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. The group, known as LeT, has denied any responsibility for the attacks, but the sole surviving gunman told interrogators he was trained by LeT, Indian authorities have said. Pakistani authorities deny that the attackers were from their country, instead blaming what they call ""non-state"" actors. An analyst who studies India-Pakistan tensions believes that this operation was planned and carried out by militants from Bangladesh, Pakistan -- and India. ""They needed people on the ground who could guide them and provided the inside dope,"" said Shuja Nawaz, author of ""Crossed Swords,"" which examines the role of the Pakistani army and that nation's relations with India and the United States. ""Otherwise, the Lashkar doesn't have the capacity to have cased the joints, to have made all these plans and get these people into the target area so effectively."" The two men arrested on charges of illegally purchasing cell phone SIM cards, using fake identity papers, will be questioned by police who want to know whether they sold cards used by the Mumbai gunmen, according to Calcutta Deputy Police Commissioner Jawad Shamim. SIM cards -- subscriber identity modules -- are portable memory chips that make it easy to switch cell phones. Intelligence experts say they're used by terrorists to throw their pursuers off the trail. Though Shamim suggested that reporters should not jump to any conclusions about a connection, he acknowledged there were unconfirmed suspicions that one of the slain gunmen carried a mobile phone card activated in Calcutta. ""It's now up to the Mumbai police to investigate,"" Shamim said. Indian security sources told CNN sister network CNN-IBN on Thursday that a Bangladeshi national bought cell phone SIM cards for the attackers at several locations inside India. An Indian man was arrested along with five foreigners in north India in February with sketches and maps of Mumbai locations that included several of those attacked last month. Faheem Ahmed Ansari, an Indian citizen who carried a fake Pakistani passport, sits in an Indian jail awaiting trial on charges of planning a suicide attack on Mumbai's stock market and the Churchgate railway station. At the time of their arrest 10 months ago, Amitabh Yash, senior superintendent of police in the state of Uttar Pradesh, called the arrest of the six men ""very significant."" ""Generally, we catch two or three of them; the rest manage to escape,"" he said. ""But then, this is also a warning because that tells us how extensive the network is,"" Yash said. ""And you can be sure there will be others."" Indian security officials have been heavily criticized since last month's attacks on Mumbai for not heeding the warning signs. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Investigators arrest two suspected black market dealers in cell phone chips .

"(CNN) -- Eleven-year-old Ewelina Bledniak was looking at a year split from her parents, split from her friends, away from everything she loves about living in America. Ewelina Bledniak hopes to stay in the United States with her parents, Hubert and Agnieszka. The federal government was ready to deport Ewelina to her native Poland because when she was 3 years old, the family missed a deadline to file a key immigration document. ""I love going to school here, and my friends, I'm going to miss them,"" Ewelina said as she worried about being deported. ""I like living here."" But things are looking up. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorney last week asked the U.S. Immigration Court in Atlanta, Georgia, to reopen Ewelina's case and terminate the deportation proceeding ICE had initiated. The motion asks the court to send the case back to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for resolution. ""They seem to be willing to find a favorable solution to this matter,"" said Ewelina's attorney, Maria Odom of Atlanta. ""... It's good news for the child, absolutely.""  Watch family, attorney discuss girl's immigration battle » . It was the first good news the Cumming, Georgia, family had received in a while. Her father, Hubert, came to the United States legally and is a naturalized U.S. citizen; and her mother, Agnieszka (Agnes), also arrived legally and is a legal resident. Ewelina is neither. Under a temporary amnesty program at the turn of the 21st century, illegal immigrants could seek legal status without returning to their home countries. However, a previous lawyer for the Bledniak family missed an April 2001 deadline to file the petition, the Bledniaks say. Years later, when it realized Ewelina had never achieved legal status, ICE ordered her to return to Poland to apply for legal U.S. residency through the U.S. Embassy there. That process could have taken a year, Odom said. The government gave Ewelina until July 23 to leave the country voluntarily; after that date, she would be deported and ineligible to return to the United States for 10 years, Odom said. The family has booked a July 20 flight to Warsaw, Poland, where the parents planned to stay for a few weeks before leaving the girl with her maternal grandmother while the immigration process played out. ""The feeling of waking up and just being in Poland, it's going to be, like, confusing,"" the soft-spoken sixth-grader said before getting the good news. ""And, like, both of my parents aren't going to be there, and my friends. ... There's nothing that's going to be the same."" Records show baby Ewelina was brought into the United States illegally in the summer of 2000, a few months after her mother arrived on a visitor visa. Hubert Bledniak arrived in the U.S. in the early '90s and became a citizen in 2006, Odom said. The couple married in the United States in 2001, Odom said. The law requires immigrants in Ewelina's situation to return to their home countries, even if it means separating children from their parents, Odom said. ""This is very typical of a lot of family immigration cases, and it creates a lot of family separation,"" Odom said. ""It sends children to countries that they don't know anymore. It separates mothers and fathers that often have to go back to the home countries to legalize."" The case has received attention in the mainstream media and the blogosphere, putting pressure on the federal government to relent. A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services representative told CNN on Friday that the agency would have no comment on the case until it is resolved. Ewelina speaks English and Polish, but fears she doesn't speak Polish well enough to thrive in school in Poland. ""I'm more comfortable speaking English,"" she said. Hubert Bledniak, who owns a tile business, questioned the morality of the immigration policy and the emotional effect it could have on his daughter. ""I know law is law and you have to follow the rules, but I don't think it makes sense to separate families like that, especially when she is only 11 years old and it's going to be hard for her,"" he said. ""I think she's going through something like, you get family separation because of divorces and stuff like that, and that's how children react,"" he continued. ""And I think she's lost and confused [because of] what's going on with her life."" The family earlier had planned a vacation trip to Poland to visit with relatives and to give Ewelina a chance to learn about her heritage. Ironically, however, if she receives a favorable decision from CIS, Ewelina can't leave the United States until she gets her green card, Odom said. ""I think she'd much rather be stuck here,"" Odom said. ""I am an immigration attorney, and I see families being separated every single day because of our law,"" she said. ""Our law is designed for enforcement primarily, and it really does not have family unity as a priority. And that is part of the reason why this system is so broken: because our government is not taking into consideration the human aspect of the effect of that law."" Journalist Chris Erickson contributed to this report.","Immigration enforcement agency files court motion to halt proceeding .

"(CNN) -- The eight teenagers crammed into an SUV that was only supposed to seat five. They were driving a vehicle that was reported stolen. And they were speeding down a two-lane northeastern Ohio road, authorities say. But any poor judgment was quickly eclipsed by a tragic crash that cut short six young lives. The black Honda Passport veered over the left side of the road, crashed into a guardrail and flipped over into a pond near the city of Warren. Investigators are trying to determine why, but Ohio State Highway Patrol Lt. Brian Holt said Monday that weather was not a factor in what he called the deadliest traffic accident in Trumbull County history -- and the worst in Ohio in at least three years. The vehicle was going faster than the 35-mph posted limit, but the exact speed wasn't clear, Holt said. Officers are waiting for the results of toxicology tests, but Holt said no signs of alcohol or drugs were found inside the vehicle. None of the passengers was wearing seat belts, the highway patrol said in a statement. It also said that the owner of the SUV reported it stolen on Monday, although the statement did not indicate whether the owner had been aware of the accident. No defects were found in the car that could have contributed to the crash. The Ohio State Highway Patrol identified those killed as Alexis Cayson, 19; Andrique Bennett, 14; Kirklan M. Behner, 15; Daylan Ray, 15; Brandon A. Murray, 14; and Ramone M. White, 15. All were from Warren. Murray had initially been identified as 17. Teen tragedy: 5 die in fiery collision with tanker truck in Texas . A desperate search . Two of the injured occupants managed to escape by breaking a rear window in the submerged vehicle, emerging from the pond, then running about a quarter mile to a nearby home to call 911, Holt said. Within minutes, a dive team plunged into the 4Â½- to 5-foot deep water to search for the rest. But none of the other six survived. ""With the vehicle upside down, (that much water) would have been enough to completely immerse the interior of the vehicle,"" Holt said. The divers ""did an amazing job,"" Holt said. ""I know that the end result was tragic, but you can't ask for better response, professionalism. They got in the water immediately, and they did what they could do,"" he said. Cayson was behind the wheel, the highway patrol said. ""She was loving. She was silly, and she was a clown. She liked to make everybody laugh even when we were sad,"" her sister Ashia Cayson told CNN affiliate WKBN in Youngstown, Ohio. Deanna Behner wept as she remembered her son Kirklan, a popular teen with many friends. ""I got the call that he was in an accident, and when they picked him up they said his heart wasn't working and they tried for hours to get him to come back,"" Behner told WKBN. Behner said all eight teens were close friends who lived in the same neighborhood. Holt said it's unclear where the teenagers were going when they crashed shortly before 7 a.m. Sunday near Warren, about 15 miles west of the Pennsylvania state line. He said the two survivors were cooperating with investigators. Sadly not uncommon . About a quarter of 15- to 24-year-olds who died in 2010 were killed in motor vehicle accidents, according to the most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The motor vehicle deaths significantly outpaced the other top culprits: firearm wounds, homicides, suicides and accidental poisonings. While the number of young drivers involved in fatal crashes has dropped significantly over the past decade, 15- to 20-year-old drivers were at the wheel in 10% of deadly accidents in 2010, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's latest numbers. A community devastated . Teddy bears now line the guardrail by the crash site. Mourners left notes for the teens, several of whom were students at Warren schools. ""We're a community that celebrates our victories together, whether they're in the classroom or on the sports fields and arenas. So we're also a community that pulls together and cares for each other at times like this,"" Warren Mayor Doug Franklin said. Grieving friends and classmates gathered to mourn Sunday night at the Willard K-8 School, where two of those killed attended. Community leaders initially discussed closing area schools but decided it was important to keep them open Monday. ""We actually had some of the students who were siblings of some of the deceased, and they came to school today, and I think they needed that support,"" Warren schools Superintendent Michael Notar said at a news conference Monday, fighting back tears at times. ""I think in times like these (affected students) reach out to teachers and to other students that they feel comfortable being around. And so we just wanted to keep our doors open for our students and provide that support that they may not get if we close school and leave them at home,"" Notar said. Grief counselors visited local schools Monday to help students and staff with the emotional aftermath. Ashia Cayson said she wants others to learn from the shock of losing her sister. ""Pick up the phone and call your siblings, your family and tell them you love them. You never know what can happen. Tomorrow is not promised to anybody.""

"(CNN) -- Tuesday -- Barcelona. It was supposed to be the end of an era, the end of a generation. Had it not been for a post, then perhaps the world would be looking at a different future. Football is nothing but fickle. The headline will be Barcelona's 4-0 annihilation of AC Milan, swatting aside the critics and doubters in the only way that this great team know how. Had the ball deflected off the post and spun the other way, the chilling inquest into Barcelona's fall of grace would have already begun. The biggest of games, the smallest of margins. Trailing 2-0 from the first leg, Barca was in a supposed crisis, its crown as Europe's dominant force precariously balanced. Consecutive defeats to arch rival Real Madrid in domestic competition and the anemic display at San Siro just three weeks ago had stoked the fires. But on this occasion, it was not just at the Vatican where black smoke rose across Italian skies, but also in Milan, as its Champions League dream went up in flames. It could have been a different story -- but history is written by the victors and Barcelona were victorious by a considerable distance. Without coach Tito Vilanova, who is still undergoing cancer treatment, question marks had emerged about the ability of the club to make it through to its sixth consecutive quarterfinal. And perhaps, but for a post and a roll of the ball, those questions would have been answered quite differently. Maybe the opportunity fell to the wrong man. At just 18, M'Baye Niang cut an unlikely cast member for the role of hero. Without a goal to his name since his move to Milan at the end of last season, it was he who was given the golden opportunity to bring Barca to its knees with just seven minutes of the opening period remaining. Already trailing to Lionel Messi's fifth minute strike, Niang took advantage of an error by Javier Mascherano before gliding towards goal. This was the moment that Milan had waited for and while Niang hit his effort hard and true, it crashed against the post and away to safety. An away goal then would have given even Barcelona a mountain to climb with a minimum of four goals needed to progress. Whether Barcelona's world would have crumbled had that ball nestled in the far corner will never be known, but had it done so, then Milan would have at least given itself a chance. That Barca recorded four anyway will not help Niang sleep any better. There is little room for ""What if?"" in sport however and Barcelona left little to chance as it went on to produce a mesmeric performance. Only last week, a Japanese jeweler created a 25 kilogram solid $5.25 million gold statue of Messi's left foot, although the price may well rise following his latest exploits. His early strike, a sumptuous effort following a delightful pass from Xavi, was his 57th in the Champions League, placing him second behind Raul in the all-time top scorers of Europe's elite competition. His 58th came less than 100 seconds after Niang had threatened to send shockwaves throughout Europe. This time, albeit with a suspicion of offside, Messi unleashed an unstoppable drive from 20-yards after Massimo Ambrosini had gift wrapped possession to the Barca man. The halftime whistle brought some solace for Milan, but it only delayed the inevitable. If there were any statisticians in the Milan dressing room then they may have known that Barcelona had won both of its previous games during a papal conclave. But not even a prayer was going to help the Italian side out of this. Just 10 minutes of the second period had elapsed when Kevin Constant's dreadful error allowed Xavi's pass to skip into the path of David Villa, who curled an exquisite effort into the far corner. Milan threatened sporadically and a wonderful block from Jordi Alba denied Robinho as Barcelona began to look nervous for the first time in the contest. But Alba soon laid any worries to rest, racing onto Alexis Sanchez's pass deep into stoppage time before slotting the ball past Abbiati. For Roura, the result was a relief. ""If there was anyone not sure about Messi then this was the perfect response as he took charge of the game with two goals and showed again that he is an extraordinary player, out of this world,"" he told reporters. ""Before we weren't so poor and now we are not so great and I wouldn't describe ourselves as favorites for the competition. ""At any stage of the game until the final goal we could have gone out if we had conceded and I would have said the same that we played well and were composed."" Crisis? What crisis. From the cradle to the grave service provided by Schalke . In the night's other game, Galatasaray booked its place in the last eight with a dramatic 3-2 win over Schalke in Germany to progress 4-3 on aggregate. Following a 1-1 draw in the first leg, Schalke looked set to progress when Roman Neustadter prodded home from close-range. But Galatasaray, boasting the likes of Didier Drogba and Wesley Sneijder, was soon level thanks to a stunning 25-yard drive from former Schalke player Hamit Altintop. Burak Yilmaz then grabbed his eighth goal of the competition to put Galatasaray ahead and put himself top of the Champions League goalscoring charts. Marco Hoger smashed an effort against the crossbar with 63 minutes gone before Michel Bastos leveled soon after. But with Schalke pushing up for a winner, Umut Bulut raced through to score and seal his side's place in the quarterfinals for the first time in 12 years. ""We showed we deserve to be in the quarter-finals, but it was a close game and both teams had their chances,"" said Altintop. ""Perhaps we had a bit of luck at the end, but I'll take that. ""We responded well to fight back after conceding the early goal.""","Barcelona crushed AC Milan 4-0 to progress 4-2 on aggregate .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Four California men allegedly victimized in clerical sex abuse have settled their lawsuits against their former priest, the Los Angeles Archdiocese and Cardinal Roger Mahony for almost $10 million, their attorneys said Tuesday. The priest, no longer in the clergy, abused the boys on several occasions dating back to the 1970s, including during overnight trips to San Diego and Riverside counties, the attorneys said. The priest pleaded guilty to molesting boys in 2007 and was released in 2011 with credit for time served, the attorneys said. Four civil lawsuits were filed separately by two brothers and two other people, and the plaintiffs reached a settlement this month with the church and Mahony, said attorney Vince Finaldi of Irvine, California. None of the plaintiffs was a victim in the criminal case against the priest, but a third brother of the two sibling plaintiffs was a victim, Finaldi said. Abuse victims' group names preferred picks for new pope . J. Michael Hennigan, an attorney for the archdiocese, confirmed the settlement of $9.9 million with the four men who alleged the former priest, Michael Baker, was their abuser. ""We accepted responsibility for all of Michael Baker's misconduct, and the issue with respect to these cases was trying to find an acceptable number to resolve the cases,"" Hennigan told CNN. Baker couldn't be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. He and Mahony are identified as defendants in one of the lawsuits, Finaldi said. Though the other three lawsuits don't list Baker and Mahony as defendants, Finaldi said they are indeed defendants. Under California procedural requirements, defendants are not listed by name in suits filed by sex abuse plaintiffs older than age 26, Finaldi said. Mahony is in Rome as part of the cardinals' conclave voting for a new pope. None of the 115 cardinals is reachable during that voting process. Early Tuesday morning, Mahony sent out his last pre-conclave message on his Twitter account before he and the other cardinals took an oath of secrecy in the Sistine Chapel. The cardinals reside at Casa Santa Martha in the Vatican during the conclave. ""Last tweet before moving to Casa Santa Martha, and Mass to Elect a Pope. First Conclave meeting late Tuesday afternoon. Prayers needed,"" Mahony wrote. Tod Tamberg, an archdiocese representative with Mahony in Rome, referred all inquiries to Hennigan. The four lawsuits alleged that Mahony knew of Baker's sexual abuse of boys and allowed him to continue to serve as a priest, Finaldi said. Baker's files as a priest were among the 12,000 pages of documents that the archdiocese released earlier this year about how it handled allegations of sexual abuse by priests. ""Those files show that they knew exactly who Baker was and what he was doing,"" Finaldi said. The lawsuits filed by the two brothers were scheduled for trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court on April 9, but then a settlement was reached, Finaldi said. The plaintiffs' attorneys have scheduled a Los Angeles news conference on Thursday during which one of the plaintiffs will publicly identify himself and make a statement, Finaldi said. Each plaintiff is identified as a ""John Doe"" with different middle initials in the lawsuits. The four settlements range from $995,000 to $4 million, the attorneys said.

"(CNN) -- It's safe to assume that most people outside West Africa had never even heard of Mali until a few weeks ago. If they had, there's a good chance it was thanks to some beautifully flowing song or instrumental by one of the country's many world-renowned musicians: Salif Keita, Tinariwen, Oumou Sangare, Toumani Diabate, Rokia Traore... the list is long. If it wasn't music then it might have been Mali's priceless medieval manuscripts that drew their attention, or its majestic mud-built mosques, its filmmakers, poets, photographers and writers. Like Jamaica or Ireland, Mali's music and culture are its primary asset, its shop-window to the world, its ""gold and cotton"" as one famous musician put it. Certainly, very few people would have included the words ""Mali"" and ""Islamism"" in the same sentence before April last year, when Islamist militia took control of over two thirds of the country and started amputating the hands of thieves, stoning adulterers and whipping women who happened to venture out into the streets 'improperly' dressed. With the arrival of French forces and the mass hostage seizure at the Algerian oil facility of In Amenas, Mali and Islamism are two words that now appear not only to be inextricably linked but on the front page. Six reasons why Mali matters . Of course, the association goes back much further than April 2012. Al Qaeda and the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) moved south from Algeria and into Mali's remote northern deserts over a decade ago. It proceeded to amass a fortune from kidnapping, smuggling and money laundering whilst undermining the local economy, disrupting social relations and destroying the local tourist industry. It brought along a hardcore form of Islam inspired by Wahabism and a hatred of the West that was previously almost unheard of in Mali, a country which has long contented itself with gentler and more tolerant brands of Sufism richly tinted by local pre-Islamic beliefs. AQIM also managed to hijack a rebellion against the central government in Bamako by the nomadic Touareg people of the north that had been grinding on and off for the best part of fifty years. This conflict, which first erupted in 1963, was always about power, influence and the self-determination of a marginalized people. It was also about preserving the Touareg's unique Berber culture. It had never been about imposing hard line Islam on anyone. But from round 2006 onwards, Touareg nationalism and Islamic terrorism became inextricably confused with each other. Why Africa backs French in Mali . Indeed, there's a widespread theory, confirmed by the word of just a few bit-players in the drama but lacking any more conclusive evidence, that certain parties who were utterly averse to the idea of an independent Touareg state -- the Malian government, Algeria and others -- either deliberately implanted AQIM in the region, or at the very least tolerated its presence there. It was hoped that the strategy would attract military aid and doom the Touareg nationalist project to failure. The theory might seem strange given the damage that terrorism has wrought in both Mali and Algeria but most Touareg I know accept it as gospel. We'll probably never know the whole truth. What's certain is that the Sahara is one of the hardest places on earth for an outsider to understand. Its interlocking cogs of power and influence -- geopolitical, regional, governmental, tribal, mineral, criminal, spiritual, clan and family -- are fiendishly complex. No foreign intervention can hope to achieve any long-term benefits if it cannot get to grips with the underlying political and social mechanism of this vast region. 2011 brought the Arab Spring and the end of Muammar Gadhafi, who had long been a stabilizing force in the Sahel, and both a promoter and a hinderer of Touareg nationalist ambitious. His weapons arsenals were opened up to armed groups of every stripe and in January 2012, the Touareg used this opportunity to reignite their rebellion in northern Mali. But it was al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb who eventually took control, either directly or through a network of alliances. Now Mali's hopes lie with the French, who intervened on Friday January 11, after months of diplomatic wrangling at the U.N. and elsewhere. France 'not a pacifist nation' So the world has a new front on the global war on terror and France has a new battle to fight in Africa. Within northern Mali itself, however, and throughout the Muslim world, this is not seen as a war on terror but as a cultural conflict, one that pits a group of people who feel that the future of their society will be best served by rejecting Western liberal values and returning to the core tenets of Islam against another group who believe in religious tolerance, secularism, democracy and music. This conflict turns musicians, artists and writers into frontline soldiers. Saudi Arabia destroyed its mausoleums and silenced its musicians decades, even centuries, ago. In the Algerian civil war of the 1990s, many musicians, writers and cultural figures were killed, prompting others to flee overseas. In Mali they're still singing, still writing, still fighting, for the time being at least. In this new battleground in the cultural wars of the Muslim world, a distant mirror of the religious wars that shook Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, Malian musicians are taking a stand. That's why music matters. That's why Mali matters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andy Morgan.","Until recently, Mali was better known for its music, mosques and manuscripts than for conflict .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- ""Troubling and counterproductive"" rhetoric from North Korea is inflaming tensions on the Korean peninsula, but ultimately, ""we will judge North Korea by its actions, not its words,"" the U.S. envoy to North Korea said Friday. In its latest bout of saber-rattling, North Korea on Friday warned of the possibility of ""strong physical counter-measures"" against South Korea after the United Nations imposed tougher sanctions against the North earlier this week. The threat against South Korea came a day after the North said it would carry out a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. The statement Friday from North Korea's Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said it would take action against South Korea if it ""takes a direct part"" in the U.N. sanctions. U.N. Security Council slams North Korea . The South Korean Unification Ministry declined to comment specifically on the new threats from Pyongyang. It reiterated its stance that North Korea should refrain from further provocations. ""Now is a moment when I think all parties in the six-party process, in particular here, North Korea, should turn their attention to how to peacefully and diplomatically address challenges that concern them,"" U.S. envoy Glyn Davies said from Beijing. The two Koreas have technically still been at war since the all-out conflict between them in the 1950s. Smaller scale clashes have occurred since then, most recently in November 2010 when North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing several people. South Korea and the United States are often the focus of menacing language from Pyongyang, but the latest U.N. sanctions, a response to a long-range rocket launched last month by the North, appear to have prompted a ratcheting up of the threats. Opinion: For the U.N. and North Korea -- Game on . A displeased Chinese editorial . At the same time, North Korea's strong words and vow to conduct a third nuclear test -- previous ones took place in 2006 and 2009 -- appear to be testing the patience of its main ally, China, which voted in favor of the U.N. sanctions this week. An editorial published Friday in the English-language edition of the state-run Chinese newspaper Global Times struck a displeased tone over Pyongyang's comments a day earlier. ""China's role and position are clear when discussing the North Korea issue in the U.N. Security Council,"" the editorial said. ""If North Korea engages in further nuclear tests, China will not hesitate to reduce its assistance to North Korea."" That prospect carries weight, since North Korea's impoverished economy relies heavily on China to stay afloat. Global Times, whose editorial line often but not always reflects official Chinese policy, made it clear, though, that Beijing isn't about to cut Pyongyang loose. Timeline: North Korea's rocket-fueled obsession . ""If the U.S., Japan and South Korea promote extreme U.N. sanctions on North Korea, China will resolutely stop them and force them to amend these draft resolutions,"" the editorial said. Global Times noted that Beijing had put ""a lot of effort into amendments"" to the resolution approved by the Security Council this week. ""It seems that North Korea does not appreciate China's efforts,"" it said. ""It criticized China without explicitly naming it in its statement yesterday."" The newspaper was referring to a passage in the controversial North Korean statement Thursday that said that ""big countries, which are obliged to take the lead in building a fair world order, are abandoning without hesitation even elementary principle, under the influence of the U.S. arbitrary and high-handed practices."" The Global Times editorial also suggested that North Korea shouldn't rank too highly among China's priorities. ""China hopes for a stable peninsula, but it's not the end of the world if there's trouble there,"" it said, referring to the Korean peninsula that comprises North and South Korea. ""This should be the baseline of China's position."" The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday had urged North Korea and the West to ""keep calm, remain cautious and refrain from any action that might escalate the situation in the region."" How dangerous is North Korea's nuke capability? U.S. concerned but prepared . U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said Thursday there are no ""outward indications"" that North Korea is about to conduct a nuclear test, but he admitted it would be hard to determine that in advance. ""They have the capability, frankly, to conduct these tests in a way that makes it very difficult to determine whether or not they are doing it,"" he said in a Pentagon press conference. ""We are very concerned with North Korea's continuing provocative behavior,"" Panetta said, but he added that the United States is ""fully prepared"" to deal with any provocations.

"(CNN) -- Two New Jersey state troopers who led an unauthorized high-speed escort of a caravan of sports cars last year agreed Monday to resign, according to the New Jersey attorney general's office. Sgt. 1st Class Nadir Nassry, 47, who led the March 30, 2012, caravan of exotic cars down a state highway to Atlantic City, pleaded guilty to a fourth-degree charge of falsifying or tampering with records. Nassry admitted that he used black electrical tape to change the numbers on the license plates of his troop car to conceal his participation in the escort, authorities said. Ss many as 30 high-performance cars including Porsches, Lamborghinis and Ferraris reportedly reached speeds of more than 100 miles an hour during the highway run. Drivers were members of a sports car club, according to the state attorney general's office. Under a plea agreement, the state will recommend that Nassry, a 26-year veteran of the New Jersey State Police, be sentenced to a term of probation, forfeit his job with the state police and be permanently barred from any law enforcement position or public employment in New Jersey. Nassry will be sentenced April 29 according to the New Jersey attorney general's office. A second trooper who assisted in the escort, Joseph Ventrella, 29, agreed to waive indictment and be charged by accusation with fourth-degree falsifying or tampering with records, according to the attorney general's office. Ventrella will apply for a state intervention program. If completed, the charges will be dropped. The agreement means he did not plead guilty to the charge, but he has forfeited his job with the state police and will be permanently barred from any law enforcement position in New Jersey, said the attorney general's office. ""These troopers violated those standards and betrayed the public's trust, undermining public safety and the reputation of the force. They are justly paying a high price for their poor judgment. Both men have ended their law enforcement careers, and one will have a felony record for the rest of his life,"" said New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey S. Chiesa. Attorneys for Nassry and Ventrella did not immediately return calls for comment.","The caravan included Porsches, Lamborghinis and Ferraris .

"(CNN) -- The body of a 16-year-old honor student from North Carolina -- missing since December -- has been found in a Maryland river, her father and police said Thursday. Russell Barnes, the girl's father, said that a female body found in the Susquehanna River in northeast Maryland is that of his daughter, Phylicia Barnes. It was recovered about 40 miles from where she was last seen, in the city of Baltimore. On Thursday night, Maryland State Police Superintendent Terrence Sheridan and Baltimore Police Commissioner Fred Bealefeld confirmed at a press conference that the body is that of the teenager student from Charlotte, North Carolina. ""All of us, since that fateful day, have been praying and hoping for a different outcome,"" said Bealefeld. ""But unfortunately, we are here today."" Phylicia Barnes' body was one of two found Wednesday in the river -- one south and the other north of the Conowingo Dam -- state police said. Her body was recovered around 10 a.m. that morning, less than three hours after people spotted it and flagged down police, said Sheridan. Authorities spotted another body -- which hasn't been identified but was described by the superintendent as a black male weighing 240 pounds and standing about 6 feet, 4 inches tall -- floating in water about three to four miles away just before 2 p.m.Wednesday. There were no clothes on either body. ""There's no other indication of any connection,"" Sheridan said of the bodies, besides the fact both were found in the same river, though he didn't rule out a link. The teenage girl said she was going out to get something to eat and maybe a haircut when she left a residence in Baltimore where she'd been staying with her half-sister, according to that city's police. Later, authorities said they feared that Barnes had been abducted or otherwise harmed. She had left her debit card where she was staying, and hadn't answered her cell phone since her disappearance, her mother, Janice Sallis, told HLN. Sallis, who described herself as very ""protective"" as a mother, said she was ""stunned"" and ""devastated"" after learning from one of Phylicia Barnes' siblings ""there was a listing of 20 different guys going in and out"" of where the teen was staying. The mother claimed that the daughter was also allowed to drink alcohol. On Thursday, Russell Barnes said that his daughter didn't know anyone besides immediate family in Baltimore. ""She's a well-loved individual, with everyone,"" Russel Barnes told HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" According to police, Phylicia Barnes communicated through text messages with her half-sister about 12:30 p.m. the day she disappeared. The half-sister's ex-boyfriend was moving out of the apartment and he saw the teenage girl on the couch around 1:30 p.m. But he said when he came back around 5:10 p.m., she was not there there. The door was reportedly unlocked, and music was blasting very loudly in the apartment. In January, Baltimore police spokesman Anthony J. Guglielmi said the FBI did a profile on the girl and found no reason that she might run away. She was a good student with no major emotional disturbances in her life, he said. ""The fact set of this case is different than anything else we've seen,"" he said. Her body was positively identified at the Baltimore city medical examiner's office thanks to a tattoo on ""her lower extremity,"" said Sheridan. He added there was ""no indication of any overt wounds or injuries,"" nor any indication either body found was weighed down. The superintendent said the bodies may have been dumped much further down the fast-moving river, and said that its cold temperatures may have prevented the bodies from signficantly decomposing for several months. ""The medical examiner has indicated that it's not out of the ream that the body could have been there"" since December, said Sheridan. ""If you look at that river, look at how fast it's moving, all sorts of things could have happened."" Bealefeld, the top policeman in Baltimore, vowed that authorities will ""work as hard now as we've worked all those days since December 28."" A city police spokesman earlier said more than 100 Baltimore police officers, Maryland State Police troopers and FBI agents had been working on the case. ""Our goal is simply to bring closure to Phylicia Barnes' family ... and hold those responsible accountable,"" Bealefeld said. The girl's father called the discovery of her body a ""first step"" in providing closure. But he said that the family won't be fully satisfied until justice is done. ""We're still not finished,"" Russell Barnes said. ""We're going to find out what happened with Phylicia ... There are a lot of answers that we need to find out.""

"(CNN) -- Relief teams dug through rose gardens at the headquarters of the Bangladesh Rifles Sunday, looking for more than 70 army officers still missing -- and presumed killed -- after a deadly uprising by paramilitary forces last week. Bangladeshi firefighters continued to uncover bodies Friday of Bangladesh Rifles officers from a mass grave. By late Saturday night, 72 bodies had been found floating in a river or in three mass graves inside the compound of the Rifles, or BDR, in the capital city, Dhaka, the Home Ministry said. Fifty of the dead were confirmed to be army officers, shot or stabbed to death. Another six were Rifles troops, or jawans. The rest of the bodies were too damaged for immediate identification, the ministry said. But four days since the rebellion, grieving family members keeping vigil outside the headquarters were losing hope of seeing their loved ones alive again. Some men quietly recited verses from the Quran, Islam's holy book, or counted prayer beads. Several women howled in despair and collapsed hopelessly on the pavement. Sympathy for the mutineers has dried up, a Bangladeshi journalist said. ""The first day of the incident, Bangladeshis were for the BDR. They thought they had legitimate concerns of army officer corruption and denial of basic necessities to them,"" said Ashraf Kaiser, host of the television show, ""Road to Democracy."" ""But from the second day, when we started getting news of missing officers and seeing pictures of one body after another being pulled out, the perception changed,"" he said. One can see the shift in the media coverage of the mutiny, he said. ""What was being called Pilkhana revolt or rebellion"" -- named after the area of the city where the BDR compounds are located -- ""is now being dubbed the Pilkhana massacre."" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina initially earned high marks for persuading the jawans to surrender in exchange for amnesty. But now she finds herself in a delicate balancing act: trying to appease an army that demands the killers, who stubbed out the lives of so many of its officers, be punished. She met for hours Sunday with the army's top officials, and made several concessions. A committee the Home Ministry set up to investigate the mutiny will be shuffled to include more members from the army's ranks. She has also backtracked from her promise of amnesty. Killers will face trial, she said, and ordered jawans to return to their posts or report to police stations by the end of the day Sunday. Hundreds of jawans lined up at a field outside the Pilkhana headquarters, insisting to reporters they fled the compound during the rebellion. They kissed their loved ones as they waited, assuring wives and fathers they were innocent but asking for their prayers. The fear of a military take-over is a pervasive one in Bangladesh. The country has experienced a series of coup since its independence in 1971, including one that killed Hasina's father -- the country's independence leader. The current government itself came to power in December, after two years of an army-backed rule. ""Hasina has her responsibility to keep peace and tranquility and so she did what she did,"" said Aneeqa Khan, a student who lives not far from the BDR headquarters. ""And you can't fault the army from reacting. They lost so many people."" The military did its part to allay fears of retaliation. ""I believe if exemplary punishment is meted out to the people involved directly or indirectly in the mutiny, it will help pacify the anger among our officers and soldiers,"" Brig. Gen. Mahmud Hossain told reporters. The standoff started Wednesday when BDR troops rebelled against their commanders. The BDR is a paramilitary force distinct from the army, but its commanders are career army officers. The Rifles is responsible primarily for guarding the country's borders. The force, more than 65,000-strong, also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls. The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week, when officers and troops from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. Discontent had been bubbling for years in the ranks of the BDR, who complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and their requests to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations -- which pay far more than what they make at home. Bangladesh and its South Asian neighbors are the largest troop contributors to U.N. peacekeeping operations. During the stand-off, dozens of officers were killed. Some bodies were dumped in mass graves. Others were tossed in sewers that emptied into the Buriganga River, where they floated for miles before being retrieved.","72 bodies found floating in a river or in three mass graves inside Rifles' compound .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama invoked Donald Trump's name during Wednesday's presidential debate, claiming that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney would consider the mogul's empire a small business. ""Under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses,"" President Obama said. ""Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income."" The facts: . While there is no universally accepted definition of a small business, the federal government defines it as any business that employs fewer than 500 people. The Trump Organization employs 22,000 people. But Trump also runs a number of other companies that employ fewer than 500, meaning that -- under the federal government's definition -- he qualifies as a small business. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, which uses the 500-worker maximum in its definition, such firms employ half of all private-sector workers and pay 44% of the total U.S. private payroll. In 2009, there were 27.5 million businesses in the nation, 99.7% of which were small firms. Complete coverage of CNN's Fact Checks . IRS data on the highest-income people in the country underscores that small business does not necessarily mean small profits. Of the top 400 people â€” who got $19.8 billion in S corporation and partnership net income in 2009 â€” 237 count as small businesses. An analysis by the Urban Institute-Brookings Tax Policy Center finds that extending tax cuts for people who make more than $250,000 per year ($200,000 for single filers) would disproportionately help the richest taxpayers: 82% of the cut would go to people with more than $1 million in adjusted gross income, who would get an average tax cut of $164,000 apiece. Romney's plan does not single out small businesses for special treatment. His plan attempts to lower taxes on all businesses -- big or small. Conclusion: While Romney's plan does not define who is or is not a small business, some of Donald Trump's companies would qualify as a small business because they have fewer than 500 employees.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The wife of a controversial Chinese leader and a family aide have been arrested in connection with the death of a British businessman, Chinese state media announced Tuesday. China Central Television reported that the November death of Neil Heywood, a family friend of ousted Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai, has been ruled a homicide. Bo's wife, Bo-Gu Kailai, and family aide Zhang Xiaojun have been arrested as part of the investigation, CCTV reported. Meanwhile, Bo has been stripped of his seats in the Communist Party's Central Committee and Politburo -- the nation's ruling organs -- for an unspecified ""serious breach of regulations,"" the network announced in a late-night report. Bo was once seen as one of the rising stars of Chinese politics. But he was sacked as the Communist Party chief in Chongqing, southwestern China's biggest city, in March after a scandal involving a deputy who helped lead an aggressive crackdown on organized crime. The state news agency Xinhua said Bo-Gu and the couple's son were ""on good terms"" with Heywood, who was found dead in his hotel room in November at age 41. ""However, they had conflict over economic interests, which had been intensified,"" Xinhua reported, citing unspecified Chinese authorities. Both Bo-Gu and Zhang ""have been transferred to judicial authorities,"" Xinhua reported. ""Whoever has broken the law will be handled in accordance with law and will not be tolerated, no matter who is involved,"" the agency quoted unnamed senior officials as saying. Heywood's death was originally blamed on alcohol poisoning, according to media reports. But the case was reopened after Bo's deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge at the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu in February. After leaving the consulate, Wang was taken into custody for entering the diplomatic post without authorization and is believed to remain in custody. The son of a Maoist-era revolutionary hero, Bo rose through China's political ranks and was appointed Communist Party secretary of Chongqing, a city of more than 30 million people. He was a polarizing figure in Chinese politics but had been seen as a future contender for top leadership roles. Bo launched a heavy-handed crusade against organized crime with Wang, his police chief and eventual right-hand man. But since his fall from grace, critics came forward to recount tales of heavy-handed treatment and even outright torture as part of the campaign. Beijing-based lawyer Li Zhuang told CNN in March that he defended an alleged gang member in 2009 and discovered that his client had been repeatedly hung from a ceiling by police over a period of eight days. When he tried to expose the abuse, he said, he was arrested and tortured himself, then sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for fabricating evidence and inciting witnesses. ""Their barbaric kind of law enforcement or, rather, their trampling of the law was against everything a modern civilization stands for,"" Li said. The British government had sought a new investigation into the death of Heywood, who was married to a Chinese woman and had lived in China for more than a decade. The British strategic information consultancy Hakluyt and Co., a company formed by former officers of the spy agency MI6, has said it and other Western companies had sought Heywood's advice on doing business in China. Heywood's close relationship with the Bo family had been documented by local and international news outlets. In a 2009 interview with a Beijing newspaper, he praised the ""extraordinary talent"" of Bo's younger son, describing how the teenager excelled academically and socially at a prestigious British boarding school.","China announces arrests in the death of British businessman Neil Heywood .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Ed Horvath and Richard Neidich met 30 years ago this month. They first called themselves boyfriends, then partners, and now have been married for five years, according to Massachusetts law. Ed Horvath, left, and Richard Neidich have been together almost 30 years but get very few federal benefits. Over the years, the men have cared for each other -- when Horvath was crippled with severe arthritis and Neidich with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Today, both men are fairly healthy, but they still worry about what the future holds, especially now that Neidich, 69, is nearing retirement, with no employer to provide health insurance coverage. Horvath, a longtime employee of the Government Accountability Office, a federal agency, is perplexed about why Neidich can't receive federal benefits as his domestic partner. ""We've been together almost 30 years, and we get very few federal benefits,"" Horvath said. ""A heterosexual couple who would marry, within five seconds would have what we haven't been able to have in almost 30 years, and I think that's very sad."" On Wednesday, President Obama extended certain federal benefits to the domestic partners of federal employees. These benefits include long-term care, sick leave to take care of others and certain benefits for foreign service workers, but not full health care benefits for domestic partners.  Watch Horvath and his partner call for fairness » . Federal benefits are designated by law, and only Congress has the authority to change the regulations regarding benefits for domestic partners. Horvath points out that like many other couples nearing retirement, they consider health care an important issue in determining their future. ""It's a very significant impact on how you live, and how you would live into retirement particularly,"" he said. ""We've both had major medical issues, and getting to this point is great for us. We're thrilled to be together and have relatively good health, but you know, we've had some rough spots, and not having the reliability of having benefits, if something were to happen to me now, looking forward for Richard, it might be a struggle."" Although both men want full health care benefits for domestic partners of federal employees, Horvath is quick to point out that he understands that changes to the federal benefits law will take time. ""I'm disappointed that it can't go farther,"" he said, ""but I understand the limitations on what he [Obama] can do just with presidential power. ... I'm very optimistic that this will move ahead. Most of corporate America, most of the Fortune 500 companies have already been providing these benefits. So it's just the government catching up. ""It's nothing new, it's nothing radical. This is just a matter of equity."" Even knowing that change takes time, Horvath does take it personally. ""I feel like we've been treated like second-class citizens throughout my federal career. It hasn't been too long ago in American history that many other couples and many other families were denied coverage.""","Ed Horvath, a federal worker, unable to get health benefits for his partner .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 42 people died and another 145 were wounded in a massive car bombing Sunday in the large Pakistani seaport city of Karachi, authorities said. The toll could rise as rescue workers continued to recover bodies early Monday, said Syed Hashim Raza Zaidi, the top government official in Karachi. The blast apparently targeted Shiite Muslims who lived in buildings surrounding where the vehicle, loaded with 150 kilograms of explosives, was parked, according to senior Karachi police official Rao Anwar Ahmed. A timing device triggered the explosion next to a market in Karachi's Abbas town, Ahmed said. Two explosions were initially reported, but the second blast has been attributed to a pipe that exploded as a result of the bombing, he added. As of about midnight Sunday, no militant groups were known to have claimed responsibility, said Zaidi. Pakistan's Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and President Asif Ali Zardari both immediately condemned the attack. ""Expressing sympathies with the bereaved families, the president directed the authorities concerned to ensure that the best medical treatment was provided to the injured,"" a statement from Zardari said. Pakistani has seen several such deadly attacks in recent years, including one last month that struck a crowded marketplace on the outskirts of Quetta that killed at least 89 people and wounded at least 180 others. That blast followed a January day of bomb attacks targeting Shiites in Quetta that left at least 85 people dead. On February 1, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives near a marketplace in the northern Pakistan city of Hangu near the Afghanistan border, killing at least 23 people. Such violence is a common problem in the volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which, like Quetta's home province of Balochistan, borders Afghanistan. Karachi, meanwhile, is some 1,350 kilometers (840 miles) south of Hangu and 800 kilometers (about 500 miles) from Quetta on Pakistan's southern coast. Situated along the Arabian Sea, it is the South Asian country's financial center and its most populated city. Still, despite its distance from Pakistan's tumultuous western border areas, Karachi has not been entirely immune to violence. In February 2010, for instance, at least 18 people died in blasts targeting a bus full of Shiite religious observers and another in front of a hospital. And in late 2009, a suicide bombing targeting a Shiite procession moving through Karachi killed at least 40 people.

"(CNN) -- Burkina Faso's fairytale at the Africa Cup of Nations will have one more enthralling chapter after it overcame the might of four-time champion Ghana to seal a place in the final for the very first time in South Africa Wednesday. In a contest which was marred by a number of mystifying refereeing decisions, Burkina Faso survived the sending off of striker David Pitroipa and the ruling out of a seemingly legitimate strike to prevail on penalties. With the game ending 1-1 after extra-time, it was the Burkinabe which held its nerve to progress 3-2 on penalties and advance to Sunday's showpiece final against Nigeria. 'Super Eagles' end Ivory Coast's AFCON hopes . The Super Eagles had earlier booked their place in the final with a convincing 4-1 win over Mali in Durban. Burkina Faso, which had not won a game away from home at the tournament before arriving in South Afirca, had endured a frustrating night with referee Jdidi Slim's display a constant cause of consternation. But it will now have to take on Nigeria without star striker Jonathan Pitroipa, who was harshly shown a second yellow card for diving when it looked as if he had been fouled. Pitroipa's 117th minute dismissal leaves the Burkinabe without its two star strikers following the injury to talented forward Alain Traore. Burkina Faso should have been given the chance to take an early lead when John Boye sent Pitroipa hurtling towards the turf inside the Ghana penalty area, but the referee wrongly waved away appeals for a spot kick. Instead, it was Ghana which was controversially awarded a penalty after the Jdidi adjudged that Christian Atsu had been fouled inside the penalty area. Mubarak Wakaso stood up to fire home from 12 yards and net his fourth goal of the competition. What can we expect from the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations? With both teams struggling to play on a terrible surface at the Mbombela Stadium, the game lacked any real sort of quality. But what it lacked in quality it more than made up for in drama and excitement as Burkina Faso continued to fight back against a perceived injustice. Ghana goalkeeper Fatawu Dauda produced a wonderful reaction save to deny Aristide Bance, while Asamoah Gyan hit a post for the Black Stars. But with an hour on the clock, the underdog finally got its reward as Bance was allowed time and space to fire home a deserved equalizer. Burkina Faso make giant strides . With the game moving into extra-time, Burkina Faso appeared to have scored a dramatic winner when Prejuce Nakoulma beat Dauda to the ball and prodded into the net. But most of those packed inside the stadium were left in disbelief when Jdidi ruled the goal out for a minor clash with Kwadwo Asamoah. Worse was to follow for the Burkinabe when Pitroipa was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for diving , despite replays showing he was quite clearly fouled. In the end, the contest went to penalties and it was Burkina Faso which held its nerve with Bakary Kone, Henri Traore and Bance all scoring to send it through to the final. Burkina captain Charles Kabore told reporters: ""The referee is human, all humans make mistakes, but he happened to make too many tonight. But we're not going to dwell on that, we've qualified."" 'Super Eagles' end Ivory Coast's AFCON hopes . In the day's early kick off, Nigeria reached the final for the first time since 2000 following a comfortable victory over Mali. The Super Eages scored three times in 20 first half minutes to take control of the contest and leave manager Stephen Keshi dreaming of repeating the triumph he pulled off as a player in 1994. Elderson Echiejile headed Nigeria ahead on 25 minutes before Brown Ideye added a second on the half-hour mark. Momo Sissoko then deflected Emmanuel Emenike's free-kick into the Mali net to leave his side facing an uphill struggle. And Ahmed Musa, who replaced the injured Victor Moses , inflicted further punishment on Mali when he ran through to score eight minutes after the interval. Mali, which famously came back from 4-0 down to draw 4-4 with Angola in the opening game of the 2010 finals, pulled one back through substitute Cheick Diarra in the 75th minute. Nigeria go through . But that failed to take the shine off for manager Keshi, who is now hoping to become only the second man in the tournament's history to win the tournament as a player and a coach after Egypt's Mahmoud El Gohary, who won it in 1959 and 1998. ""We won in 1994 after we had been together for five years,"" he told reporters. ""But we have been together for five weeks. We met up for the first time in our training camp in Portugal before the tournament, and it was a young group. ""We worked hard, the atmosphere was wonderful but you cannot compare this team to that. We did play very well today and I am very happy but we haven't won anything yet.""","Burkina Faso will play Nigeria in Africa Cup of Nations Final .

"(CNN) -- Even though Android is the most popular smartphone platform in the U.S., and even though there were 10 billion Android app downloads as of December 2011, many Android users are frustrated that they're still treated like a second-class app market. That's because ""fragmentation"" makes it more complicated to develop Android apps that will run on most Android phones. New research from Localytics claims that Android fragmentation might be becoming less of a issue. If correct, this could start bringing more popular apps to Android phones faster -- or maybe even first. But the catch is, the Android ecosystem is far more variable than the iPhone landscape. That makes it a bigger long-term risk for app developers. Many popular consumer apps are still are rolled out first for the iPhone. (Hello, Instagram?) That's because many Android phones are running substantially older versions of Android, which limits which apps they can support. Plus, Android phones come in a dizzying array of sizes, configurations, and capabilities -- compared to a fairly small selection of iPhone models. Also phone manufacturers and wireless carriers tend to customize the Android interface (in ""flavors"" such as HTC Sense and Motorola Blur). Localytics provides analytics tools that app developers use to monitor how people use apps. Data gathered from Localytics users during two weeks in January indicate that most Android phones now have ""remarkably similar specifications."" Localytics notes that this significantly simplifies the job of deploying mass market Android apps. Nearly three-fourths of Android app usage came from devices running some version of Android 2.3 ""Gingerbread."" That's not the most recent version of Android (so far 4.0 ""Ice Cream Sandwich"" runs on only a handful of phones and tablets), but it's robust enough to run the vast majority of Android apps well. Furthermore, Localytics found that nearly all of the remaining Android phones are running Android 2.2 ""Froyo."" ""Between the two, Android developers can be confident that they only need to actively target two Android OS builds in order to achieve 96% compatibility with the Android ecosystem,"" said the report. Screen size and resolution are also key variables for creating Android apps. According to Localytics, just over 40% of all instances of app usage (""sessions"") came from Android devices with 4.3-inch screens. Four-inch screens accounted for a further 22 percent of sessions. And over 60% of Android app sessions came from phones with a screen resolution of 800 x 480 pixels -- such as Samsung's popular Galaxy S series of phones. What about tablets? According to Localytics, nearly three quarters of all Android tablet usage comes from devices with nearly identical characteristics -- not surprising, since Amazon's new Kindle Fire e-reader tablet is already the second most popular tablet in the world, behind the iPad. Localytics found that 74% of Android tablet usage takes place on devices with seven-inch screens with 1024 x 600 resolution. Also, 71% of Android tablets are running Gingerbread. However, ReadWriteWeb observed that the Localytics numbers might be overly optimistic. Also, as more Ice Cream Sandwich-capable devices hit the market this year, fragmentation could become a bigger problem again: . ""The best thing we can say about these numbers is that the Android ecosystem is stable... for now. In six months when there is a flood of Ice Cream Sandwich devices on the market, developers will be dealing with the need to support a vast number of Gingerbread devices while also supporting the newest functions in Android 4.0.1."" The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Localytics claims that Android fragmentation might be becoming less of a issue .

"(CNN) -- The Amateur Athletic Union kick-started a child sex abuse criminal probe against its former president when it gave Memphis, Tennessee, police the identities of three of his accusers, a spokesman for the group said Sunday. Ron Sachs spoke with CNN hours after ESPN aired, on its show ""Outside the Lines,"" interviews with two men who accused Robert ""Bobby"" Dodd of abusing them in the 1980s, when he was their coach at a YMCA program in the southwest Tennessee city. According to Sachs, the Memphis police had ""no reports from anybody"" about Dodd until the Amateur Athletic Union -- also known as the AAU -- gave them the results of their own, nearly month-long investigation last Thursday. The group previously claimed that it alerted authorities last Friday. This included revealing the identity of a ""potential third complaining victim"" who was not brought up in the ESPN report, the spokesman said. ""Only the AAU's contact with the Memphis police triggered what we believe is now a legitimate law enforcement investigation,"" said Sachs. In the ESPN report, Dodd's accusers claim he sexually abused them in hotel rooms during tournaments when they were 12 to 16 years old. CNN could not reach Dodd, 63, who was dismissed from the AAU on November 14, for comment. ESPN said it also had been unable to reach him. Dodd is distinct from the legendary, late former Georgia Tech football coach who had the same name. Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong has said that his department is probing the claims. ""Although this case has its challenges due to the amount of time that has passed, it will be thoroughly examined,"" Armstrong said. ""And if the investigation reveals the law was violated, the person responsible will be held accountable."" The allegations were made amid child sex scandals at Penn State and Syracuse universities and The Citadel; both men accusing Dodd told ESPN that the publicity from the scandals prompted them to act. Penn State's Paterno breaks pelvis in fall . Detailing its involvement, Sachs said the AAU stands by its response -- including its decision to oust Dodd, hire an investigator and then contact authorities. ""These (AAU) folks dealt with these allegations -- as brief as they were, as anonymous as they were, as salacious as they were, but lacking any specificity,"" Sachs said. The AAU got ""cryptic, brief"" e-mails -- signed only as ""shrimp breath"" -- on November 7, 8 and 9 -- that ""alleged, in a very general way, that Bobby Dodd engaged in child sexual abuse,"" said the spokesman. And on November 9, the organization got two brief voice-mails along the same lines. There was no name or contact information left in either case. Those messages were sent to the AAU's compliance and general counsel office, and AAU ""officers"" were notified on November 11. The board members, several of whom flew into Orlando, convened on the following Monday, November 14, ""to confront then-President Bobby Dodd,"" said Sachs. In that meeting, Dodd claimed he'd gotten similar phone messages and insisted he was innocent, according to the spokesman, who said he'd spoken with several AAU officers at that meeting. ""Despite those denials, the AAU officers directed that Bobby Dodd leave the premises and leave his position (as president and CEO) for an indefinite period,"" said Sachs. Under its acting president, Louis Stout, the AAU hired a private investigator to look into the allegations. Those findings were turned over to police earlier this month. One of Dodd's accusers, identified by ESPN as Ralph West of Miami, said he was 14 at the time of the alleged abuse. West said he was on a basketball team run by Dodd, who he said would sometimes slip into West's hotel room. West said he was talking publicly, despite the potential embarrassment to him and his family, not to ""gain anything"" but because he felt ""the guy shouldn't be around kids anymore."" West said Dodd abused him or tried to abuse him six times, including at least once in which he tried ""to put his hand in my boxer shorts"" while West was sleeping. Asked how Dodd could have entered the hotel room on that and other occasions, West said, ""He had a key. He always somehow had a key to whatever room I was in."" West said he tried to find ways to keep Dodd out of his hotel room when they were at out-of-town basketball tournaments, saying he was ""afraid to even fall asleep."" ""He would push his way in the room and then end up, I'd see, I wouldn't see him, I would hear him, he'd lay at the floor of the bed masturbating,"" the man said. ""And you just lay there horrified. But you don't know what to do. What, are you going to blow the lid off of this at 14 years? All you want to do is pretend it didn't happen and not address it at all. You want to hide and bury it."" Another accuser, whom ESPN did not identify, said Dodd gave him alcohol before taking him to a bedroom and touching him inappropriately. ""The last thing that I can really remember was him carrying me into his bedroom and I can remember him, you know, touching me in ways that I, I didn't uh, I didn't want another man touching me,"" the man said. That accuser said he called Dodd on November 11 and confronted him. Dodd, he said, then apologized for the alleged abuse. The network said it examined the man's phone records and verified an eight-minute phone call to Dodd's number. Both men said they had never reported the alleged incidents to police and had only recently told their families, ESPN said. Sachs criticized the half-hour ESPN report for not quoting Stout's video statement on the matter or others from the AAU. The organization, which has 80,000 adult volunteers involved in coaching and works with hundreds of thousands of young people, is asking outside experts to review its policies for protecting children, which Sachs called the AAU's ""No. 1 priority."" The spokesman also clarified that Dodd told his successor, Stout, that he had colon cancer and needed surgery after his November 14 dismissal. Dodd allegedly asked that he be able to retire for medical purposes -- a request that Stout denied, according to Sachs. ""(Stout) told Mr. Dodd to go focus on your health, go through this surgery and we'll deal with this issue later,"" said Sachs. Dodd has been back at the AAU's offices one time since his ouster, contrary to the organization's earlier reports that he'd never returned. The occasion was a ""forensic audit"" that the spokesman called ""standard"" for outgoing leaders of organizations. ""Bobby Dodd is no longer part of the AAU,"" said Sachs. ""He has no continuing role (or) involvement in their programs. There's no contact with him. Whatever compensation he would have been entitled to -- accrued vacation time -- will be paid, and that's it.""

"(CNN) -- Tunisian referee Slim Jdidi, the man whose performance came close to overshadowing Burkina Faso's astonishing fairytale passage into the final of the Africa Cup of Nations, was suspended by the Confederation of African Football on Thursday. Jdidi's officiating during the Burkinabe's semifinal victory over Ghana has been heavily criticized after he made a number of questionable decisions. Chief amongst those was the 117th-minute sending off of Jonathan Pitroipa for simulation, despite the forward quite clearly being fouled inside the Ghana penalty area. Burkina Faso fairytale ready for one last chapter . While Burkina Faso eventually prevailed 3-2 on penalties following a 1-1 draw, all the talk after the game centered on Jdidi's failure to award a legitimate penalty, his decision to disallow a valid goal and the red card he issued to Pitroipa. ""We would have expected a better standard,"" Confederation of African Football (CAF) secretary-general Hicham El Amrani told a media conference. ""There is a meeting tomorrow (Friday) to discuss the Pitroipa incident."" The Burkinabe are also hopeful that Pitroipa will have his suspension overturned, although that depends on whether Jdidi admits to the error in his match report. ""The organizing committee does not have the power to change the referee's decision unless the referee admits he made a mistake in his official report,"" said El Amrani.

""We lodged it in the two hours after the match as stipulated by the regulations. ""We think we have a good chance of winning the appeal. ""There were some scandalous decisions, we don't know why, we're asking lots of questions, there are lots of theories. ""Curiously, the players reacted better than us (the team management).

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Four years ago Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex couples to marry. Since then, more than 10,000 gay and lesbian couples have exchanged vows in the state. David Wilson and Rob Compton, of Massachusetts, were among first same-sex couples to marry in 2004. David Wilson and Rob Compton were among the first to say, ""I do."" The impact, they say, has been huge. Wilson says it was the switch from partner to husband that made a difference. ""Just using the word husband brings a level of confidence that helps say to the person we're talking with we have a right to be together, we are a couple and we love each other,"" Wilson says. Wilson and Compton chose to keep their own surnames, but they say the need to define or justify their relationship is gone -- everyone understands what being married means. Initially, there was a rush to the altar in Massachusetts. In the six months after May 17, 2004, when Massachusetts began issuing marriage licenses for gay and lesbian couples, an estimated 6,100 same-sex couples married. They now average less than 1,000 a year, according to MassEquality.org, a grassroots organization working to help gay and lesbian couples achieve equality.  Watch: David and Rob talk about what has changed » . Having the same rights as heterosexual couples means the same issues -- like divorce. So far, at least 48 same-sex divorces have been reported. Same-sex divorces are hard to track because they are recorded by the last names of the parties involved, without reference to gender, according to Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, a leading gay rights organization. There have been several attempts to stop same-sex marriage in Massachusetts since the state made it legal. The most recent attempt was in 2007, when a proposed amendment to ban such unions was defeated. Massachusetts State Rep. Paul Loscocco, a Republican, was one of several dozen lawmakers who changed their minds on the vote, deciding to vote against a ban. The change, he says, is reflective of society at large. ""I can't tell you how many calls I got from people saying, 'I called you before and now my grandson is gay -- now they're a couple -- now I've changed my mind and I want you to vote the other way,' "" says Loscocco. Groups opposed to same-sex marriage said their fight, though less visible, remains strong. ""It has not gone away in hearts and minds of people, particularly parents,"" said Kris Mineau, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute. ""The costs to family, children and culture are too great to concede this battle to those who would see marriage and family redefined to the point of irrelevancy,"" the group says on its Web site. For Wilson and Compton, legalization and wider acceptance means they're finally able to reap the same benefits of heterosexual married couples, such as hospital visitation rights. Compton was able to exercise his rights recently when he was in Rhode Island for a conference and needed emergency surgery for a kidney stone. ""I said, 'Well my husband will be coming,' and you know they didn't even blink. They just smiled and they knew I was from Massachusetts and didn't say anything,"" recalls Compton. Other benefits include the possibility of obtaining health insurance through a spouse's work and the right to file joint state tax returns, transfer property, automatically inherit shared assets and make medical decisions for a spouse. Fears that Massachusetts might become a destination for same-sex marriage for the rest of the country were put to rest when then-Gov. Mitt Romney dusted off a 1913 statute barring marriage in the commonwealth if a couple's home state did not recognize the union. But it's a different story in California, where marriage benefits will follow same-sex couples to wherever they settle. Wilson and Compton plan to be in California to celebrate, as the state on Monday becomes the second in the country to allow same-sex matrimony. Still, until same-sex marriage receives federal recognition, Wilson and Compton say, the unions will remain second-class marriages. ""We've begun the process, California is second and as all of these couples go back to their home states, they want those same benefits. They're going to take them back to those states and absolutely they will ask for those rights,"" says Wilson. ""I see it as a building block and eventually we will see this get to the federal level.""","David Wilson, Rob Compton were among first same-sex couples to marry in 2004 .

"(CNN) -- He has a long way to go to emulate the success of his father, who won five majors and thrilled the world of golf, but Javier Ballesteros is off to a promising start. The 21-year-old made his debut on the professional golf circuit Thursday, 38 years after Severiano began his pro career on exactly the same course. After starting at the Sant Cugat course in Catalunya, Spain, Seve went on to win three British Opens and two Masters titles and etch his name into the record books as one of the most entertaining and flamboyant players ever to pick up a club. Seve died in May last year, at the age of 54, provoking an outpouring of grief from the world of golf. Many stars of the game attended his funeral in his home village of Pedrena. Javier insists he doesn't feel any weight of pressure being the son of one of golf's most revered characters, but he offered a glimpse of his talent as he shot a five-under-par round to sit three shots off the lead after day one of the Peugeot Alps de Barcelona. ""My goal for this competition is enjoy it,"" he said on the European Tour's official website. ""I don't set goals when I play a tournament, especially being an amateur. ""What I have to do is enjoy and learn. I have no extra pressure being Seve's son, I don't really have anything to prove. I'm just going to be myself. ""When I registered for the Peugeot Tour event at Sant Cugat I didn't know that my father played his first professional tournament here and now that I know, it's double the excitement for me."" Seve won 91 tournaments in a 33-year career and was a crucial part of Europe's Ryder Cup team during much of the 1980s and 1990s, forming a formidable partnership with fellow Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal. Javier clearly has inherited a wealth of talent from Seve but says he is yet to decide if he will follow his father's footsteps and become a golf professional once he has finished studying law in Madrid. ""I have always played golf,"" he added. ""I was on the national team when I was 14 to 16 years old, and being surrounded by golf at home always made me think about being a pro in the future. ""But I have to finish university first. It is something my parents have always told me to do, especially my father, and that is my priority. Then we will see.

"(CNN) -- East Haven, Connecticut, Police Chief Leonard Gallo will retire after the arrests of four police officers for their alleged role in the mistreatment of Latinos, Mayor Joseph Maturo said Monday. The arrests stemmed from a federal investigation into profiling in the city, with some critics suggesting that Gallo fostered or at least overlooked a culture of ethnic prejudice within his department. The chief's lawyer acknowledged Monday that his client faces a federal lawsuit and could himself be charged, though he said Gallo is innocent, having never profiled or targeted Latinos. Gallo's retirement is effective February 3, Maturo said, adding that a search for East Haven's next police chief will begin immediately. ""While Chief Gallo's departure comes at a difficult time, it provides a unique opportunity for the department to move forward with new leadership, an opportunity for the town to move forward with the healing that is necessary given recent events, and most importantly, an opportunity for the entire East Haven community to move forward as a unified group to embrace the changes that will follow,"" the mayor said. Maturo himself got caught up in the controversy when he said last week -- after being asked what he'd do for the Latino community in light of the officers' arrests -- that ""I might have tacos when I get home, I'm not quite sure yet."" Some criticized this remark as insensitive and derogatory, and about 500 tacos were delivered to Maturo's office after a Latino activist group launched a text-for-tacos campaign to draw attention to the comment. The mayor has twice apologized since then, saying his words were largely a product of stress. On Monday, Maturo was largely complimentary of East Haven's outgoing police chief, describing him as ""a devoted public servant who performed admirably in both his personal and professional life. His decision to retire at this time is a selfless act, designed to assist in the healing process."" The police chief's attorney, Jonathan Einhorn, said the 65-year-old Gallo had been considering retirement for a while and himself made the decision to step down. This move was not an admission of wrongdoing, and should not be viewed as such, the lawyer said. Einhorn told reporters at a Monday news conference that Gallo decided to retire now in order ""not to be a distracting element in East Haven's effort to rehabilitate its image, both upon its citizens and the general public."" Gallo did not attend the news conference. East Haven police Sgt. John Miller and officers David Cari, Dennis Spaulding and Jason Zullo were arrested last week. According to a federal indictment, the four allegedly conspired to ""injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate various members of the East Haven community"" -- profiling Latino residents during traffic stops, performing illegal searches and harassing Latino business owners and their advocates. The men allegedly threatened and assaulted detainees, made false arrests -- including a local clergy member -- and later conspired to cover up evidence of their conduct by falsifying reports and blocking an investigation, prosecutors said. ""They behaved like bullies with badges,"" said Janice Fedarcyk, assistant FBI director in New York. Gallo is named as a co-conspirator in the case, his attorney told reporters Monday, and the chief is facing a federal civil lawsuit as well. Einhorn said he did not know if federal authorities will arrest Gallo, but acknowledged his client could face criminal charges. ""He is not guilty of any wrongdoing in either the civil action or potentially in any criminal action,"" Einhorn said. ""He should not be arrested, and if arrested he will be acquitted of any charges."" ""Chief Gallo has never engaged in, participated in or condoned racial profiling of any nature whatsoever,"" the lawyer added. Community leaders applauded Gallo's retirement on Monday. ""Gallo cultivated a racist and dishonest police force,"" said the Rev. James Manship of St. Rose of Lima Church, a plaintiff in the civil suit. The state's attorney should review the convictions of those arrested by the four officers ""and seek to vacate those tainted by racial bias or other unconstitutional conduct."" Angel Fernandez-Chavero, a leader of St. Rose's pastoral council, added, ""Gallo's position at the top of the East Haven Police Department signaled to the brave victims who risked everything to testify and to the Latino community that their dignity was not respected."" The police chief was placed on administrative leave by former Mayor April Capone Almon in March 2010 in response to the U.S. Justice Department investigation, according to the Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic at Yale Law School. That organization represents the plaintiffs in the civil suit against the department. Mauro reinstated Gallo as chief in November, the clinic said. In a letter to Maturo, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez said the alleged discrimination was ""deeply rooted in the (police) department's culture,"" citing statistical analysis that Latinos had been ""intentionally targeted"" for traffic stops. On one occasion in January 2009, Spaulding and Zullo allegedly assaulted two people they had arrested under false pretenses, slamming their heads against the walls of the police station's cell block, authorities said. In another incident, Miller allegedly struck a detainee who was handcuffed after being propped up by two other patrol officers. The men also thwarted a police commission inquiry into their alleged misconduct, authorities said, calling on the support of local union leaders to block and intimidate municipal investigators.","Chief Leonard Gallo's attorney says his retirement is not an admission of wrongdoing .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A key architect of Republican Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign has urged conservatives to drop their opposition to same-sex marriage. Steve Schmidt served as Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign manager in 2008. In a speech Friday to Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative gay rights group, Steve Schmidt said allowing same-sex marriage is in line with the conservative credo of keeping government out of people's private lives. ""There is a sound conservative argument to be made for same-sex marriage,"" Schmidt, who was McCain's campaign manager, told the group. ""I believe conservatives, more than liberals, insist that rights come with responsibilities. No other exercise of one's liberty comes with greater responsibilities than marriage. In a marriage, two people are completely responsible to and for each other."" He added: ""If you are not willing to accept and faithfully discharge those responsibilities, you shouldn't enter the state of matrimony, and it doesn't make a damn bit of difference if you're straight or gay. It is a responsibility like no other, which can and should make marriage an association between two human beings more fulfilling than any other."" Schmidt told CNN that the GOP must become more open if it wants to reverse a shrinking coalition, especially among younger, more accepting voters.  Watch more of Schmidt's take on the GOP » . ""People are turned off in large measure by what they see as intolerance coming out of the party,"" he said. Schmidt says he knows his is a minority view. In the presidential campaign, McCain ran against same-sex marriage. ""I don't honestly expect our party will reverse in the very near term its opposition to same sex marriage.  Nor do I yet see support for it from a strong majority of the general public,"" Schmidt told the Log Cabin Republicans. ""And, I do believe that such a highly charged political question such as this should be settled by the freely expressed will of the people, and not by the courts."" So what will change Republicans' mindset? ""One of the things that has definitely impacted my views on these issues and an evolution of thought over time is having a gay sibling,"" Schmidt told CNN. ""As Americans get to know gay couples and or have gay family members, or work associates ... they come to understand that these relationships are deep and worth being respect and being protected."" Log Cabin Republicans say they hope other party leaders now realize that election losses prove the GOP catered too much to social conservatives. ""It's great that the Republican Party is going through this soul-searching at this moment right now,"" said Charles Moran, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans. ""Republicans are thinking outside the box."" These days, their grassroots organization is reaching out to sympathetic Republicans in states debating same-sex marriage initiatives, such as New Hampshire. Recently, Iowa and Vermont approved same-sex marriages. In April, the District of Columbia Council voted to allow same-sex marriages from around the country to be recognized there, though the measure still needs to be debated in Congress. All legislation in the district must pass congressional muster. And just Thursday, New York Gov. David Paterson, a Democrat, said he plans to introduce a bill in the state Assembly to legalize same-sex marriage. And this week, another Republican group -- GOProud -- formed to push a broader agenda, advocating traditional conservative issues such as low taxes and smaller government. ""There's this misconception that if you're gay, you're liberal ... just like there's a misconception that if you're conservative, you're a bigot,"" said Jimmy LaSalvia of GOProud. Gay Republicans say they often get asked a basic question: Why are you Republican? Most argue that they believe in the principle of limited government. In fact, nearly 3 in 10 self-identified gays and lesbians voted Republican in the last presidential election, according to exit polling. But while Schmidt admitted that it will be a tough challenge for the party to accept same-sex marriage, there could be hope down the road. ""I'm confident American public opinion will continue to move on the question toward majority support, and sooner or later the Republican Party will catch up to it,"" he told the gathering. ""And I believe the nation's acceptance of same sex unions as lawful marriage would provide a far more secure guarantee that the change made to this profoundly important social institution will be permanent than would judicial fiat.""

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy is poised to become the next prime minister of economically embattled Spain, with his ascension assured after the ruling Socialist Party's candidate conceded Sunday's national election. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba made the concession before a somber audience of Socialist Party supporters -- a stark contrast to the raucous, celebratory crowd gathered outside the Popular Party headquarters in Madrid. Less than 30 minutes later, Rajoy offered ""a message of confidence"" and vowing to push for ""solidarity"" in the wake of Sunday's vote. He did so in a televised speech inside a quiet room before coming out minutes later to address the boisterous crowd. ""The Spanish people have expressed themselves, they've done so clearly,"" he said in the first address. ""And we'll now embrace this change."" As detailed on the Interior Ministry website, with 100% of the votes counted, the Popular Party had over 10.8 million votes (44.6% of the total votes) and captured 186 seats in parliament. That compares with just under 7 million votes for the Socialist Party, giving it an advantage in 110 legislative contests. A party had to win 175 seats in order to win an outright majority in the 350-seat chamber. The majority result, thus, paves the way for Rajoy's unfettered ascension to prime minister, giving him a free hand to set policy without having to first make deals with other parties. The outcome makes Spain the latest country to lose a government amid the Europe-wide money crisis. Earlier this month, the leaders of Greece and Italy resigned over their own countries' debt woes. In the closing days of the campaign, the 56-year-old Rajoy had spoken repeatedly about the nation's deep economic crisis, such as the sobering 21.5% unemployment rate overall -- including a 45% rate of unemployment for young people. Nearly 5 million working-age Spaniards are without a job, and the country faces a steep public deficit and only tepid economic growth. Some immigrant workers are also leaving the country. Entering the elections, voters told CNN the economy was their top priority. ""This vote will determine the future of the country for years to come,"" Jose Miguel Ariza, a university researcher, said after voting at the Menendez Pelayo school in central Madrid. In his initial speech Sunday night, the Popular Party leader said he would not forget those suffering -- from recent university graduates who can't find jobs to small business owners struggling to stay afloat to those hit hard by illness or other tragedies -- as he shaped policies. ""We're going to try our best to better their situation,"" he said. ""And we'll think of them before making a decision."" Rajoy has said he would not cut pensions -- which the incumbent Socialist government earlier froze, to much criticism -- but he says all other issues are on the table in order to reduce the deficit. He has also said he'll consider tax cuts for businesses to encourage them to hire more workers. A Cabinet minister between 1996 and 2004 under conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Rajoy twice lost to Socialist Party leader Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, in 2004 and 2008, in his first attempts to become prime minister. But his conservative party swept to victory in regional and local elections last May, presaging what polls had long accurately predicted would be a triumph the third time around. Zapatero called the early election and announced he would not seek a third term. While other parties and candidates were in the race, Rajoy's chief challenger had been Rubalcaba. The 60-year-old served under former Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and most recently under Zapatero, rising to the positions of deputy prime minister and Interior minister. Rubalcaba had warned that the conservatives would cut into public health and education, the social programs which he said the Socialist party would fight to preserve, despite the economic crisis. About 35 million Spaniards are eligible to vote, of whom the government claims 1.5 million are first-time potential voters, having turned 18 since the last general elections in 2008. The economic protests across Spain during the past six months have been fueled by the young -- the so called 'indignants' -- but it was not clear how much impact the protesters had on the results Sunday. Esteban Guerrero, a university student in his last year of journalism studies and who has been active in the protests, said: ""I think it's necessary to vote, but that's not enough. People feel the elections won't change the situation. They won't stop the cutbacks."" Guerrero, 25, sees his own prospects of getting a job after college as bleak. ""I think there's a pent-up rage. The workers and young people of this country are fed up,"" Guerrero said. ""It's been years of frustration, over cutbacks and lower salaries."" Putting the Iberian nation on the right track won't be easy, Rajoy admitted in his speech to celebrating supporters later Sunday night. But the incoming prime minister stressed he felt it was possible, especially if Spaniards joined forces to work toward a common goal. ""That's what it's all about -- to be together, everybody, (and) work together,"" he told the crowd. ""Our political project invites all Spaniards who want to resolve this situation. It means a lot of work, a lot of effort and a lot of unity.""","NEW: The Popular Party wins 45% of votes and 186 legislative seats, giving it a majority .

"(CNN) -- If the recent CNN/Western Republican Presidential Debate in Las Vegas was any indication, the coming months on the campaign trail are likely to be nasty between Mitt Romney and Rick Perry. After a shouting match between the two at the debate, Romney -- the former governor of Massachusetts -- responded, ""Rick, again, Rick, again, I'm speaking. ... This has been a tough couple of debates for Rick, and I understand that. And so you're going to get testy."" While elections often bring out barbs and negative attacks, the animosity is real, observers say. ""Oh, they don't get along,"" said John Avlon, a CNN contributor, author and expert on independent voters. ""They don't like each other."" ""I mean, it (the debate dust-up) was amazing,"" he said. ""You look at Rick Perry's eyes. I mean, this could have gotten physical if they were in high school."" He added that while they have real philosophical differences, this time showed it was ""personal animosity."" Read more about the debate . That point was backed up by Ed Rollins -- a longtime GOP strategist and former campaign manager to Republican candidate Michele Bachmann -- who said point-blank, ""They don't get along"" and predicted that this is going to be a ""down and nasty race."" So is it just Perry's personality, or is there an anger management issue? ""He's combative, and people have asked me, 'Is Rick Perry mean?' and I guess the question is, which Rick Perry?"" said Ken Herman, a columnist with the Austin American-Statesman in the Texas capital. ""The Rick Perry I've known professionally and casually for 25 years? I wouldn't say he's mean."" Herman added that Perry, 61, is just tough, aggressive and a ""cold-blooded politician."" William Murchison admitted in an article for the conservative magazine American Spectator that his friend's often ""combative"" style ""may not prove as right for the moment as a style that says, calm down, I can fix this, give me a chance."" Read more about Perry . Perhaps it's that toughness, though, that has kept Perry in office for so long. Perry holds the title as the nation's longest-serving governor and boasts that he's never lost an election since he first ran for the Texas House as a Democrat in 1984. He assumed his role as governor in 2000, when then-Gov. George W. Bush resigned to run for the White House. Romney, meanwhile, has often been described as cool and calm -- almost robotic -- and takes a business approach to governing and rarely shows his anger, political observers say. The former governor of the solidly blue state of Massachusetts has a history of crossing party lines to get legislation passed -- including the state's universal health care plan. Several of his rivals for the Republican Party nomination have criticized the plan, which they call Romneycare, for making all state residents get health care insurance through subsidies or mandates. The dislike between Perry and Romney, though, comes down to their roots, Rollins said. Perry was born and raised in Paint Creek, a small town in the western part of Texas, and is the son of a tenant farmer. He graduated from Texas A&M University and later joined the Air Force, where he flew C-130 aircraft. He later returned to Paint Creek to help run his parents' farm. ""He had nothing. He just scraped his entire life to get to where he was,"" Rollins said. Perry is also deemed somewhat of a guys' guy, with a history of cowboy-like tendencies. In August 2010, he shot and killed a coyote while jogging with his dog in Austin. Perry said he often carries a pistol on the trails because of snakes and other wildlife. Rollins said that perhaps Perry has anger for his fellow Republican because he ""sees a guy like Romney who sort of had everything handed to him,"" referring to the fact that Romney, 64, is the son of George Romney, the former governor of Michigan who was once president of American Motors. Romney took a much different path than Perry. Born in Detroit, he became a Mormon missionary and later graduated from Brigham Young University in 1971. Afterward, he received dual degrees from Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. He later founded Bain Capital, a private equity firm, oversaw the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and successfully ran for governor. Read more about Romney . He is worth an estimated $190 million to $250 million, according to 2011 documents released by his campaign.

"(CNN) -- A Colorado man who lived near a park crafted explosives he claimed could kill everyone within 20 meters, hoping to trade the bombs and other weapons for cocaine or cash, authorities said. Special agents with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrested Richard Sandberg, 35, on Thursday morning as he was heading to work, said Jeffrey Dorschner, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Colorado. In the afternoon, he appeared in federal court, where he was ordered held without bond until at least a detention hearing Tuesday. His arrest followed an undercover sting that revealed the suspect had an arsenal of ""homemade"" improvised explosive devices and military-grade grenades in his suburban Denver home, according to an affidavit filed by an ATF agent in federal court. The investigation began a week ago, when a Denver police detective alerted an ATF agent about a claim from a ""reliable"" informant. The informant had gone to Sandberg's house and saw ""numerous hand firearms and hand grenades"" the suspect ""wanted to trade ... for cocaine,"" according to the affidavit. That night, an undercover ATF agent talked over the phone with Sandberg, who said he was a former member of a Marine special operations unit. He claimed to have 18 M67 grenades -- which are available only in the military -- that he said he'd sell for $300 each, the ATF agent wrote. According to the affidavit, Sandberg said he'd built some explosive devices with items available at hardware stores. He said you'd need a ""formula"" to know how to make them blow up -- and they had a ""kill zone"" of 20 meters and a ""hurt zone"" of 60 meters. The devices, he said, are ""not firecrackers, not things to play with: (They are) life or death."" The undercover agent told Sandberg he was going out of town to pick up illicit drugs, then met up with him Tuesday evening at the suspect's house in Jefferson County, about 15 miles southwest of the Colorado capital. Once there, Sandberg detailed his military background as a demolition expert who'd served in Iraq, Somalia and Pakistan, and had been trained ""to build bombs and kill people,"" the affidavit states. He expressed contempt for President Barack Obama and his administration, and the ATF in particular. He later showed the undercover agent ""an iron-plated door barricade with gun turret/cutouts."" He said he was prepared to use it if law enforcement agents moved in on his house -- adding he had several thousand rounds of ammunition. ""Sandberg made numerous threatening statements toward law enforcement (that if they) came inside his house to take his guns, it would be a bad day for them and lots of them would die,"" the affidavit reads. ""Sandberg stated that he was ready and willing to die."" The suspect then showed off about six pipe bombs and 22 silver ""crickets"" (small explosive devices) and claimed that he ""could manufacture anything (the agent) wanted, including having access to C4 plastic explosives and blasting caps."" The undercover agent left with two pipe bombs and a cricket, with Sandberg saying if he ""liked them they could set up a trade for cocaine."" Authorities later tested them, and determined they qualified as ""destructive devices"" under federal law. Sandberg's arrest came two days later. Despite his promise of bloodshed, he was taken into custody -- away from the firepower he kept at home -- without incident. He is charged with one count of possession of a firearm, though more charges could be forthcoming. Swarms of law enforcement agents, including three bomb squads, descended on Sandberg's residence -- which sported a Marine flag in the yard and a ""Fire Obama"" sign in a window. His home is in the Friendly Hills neighborhood, which features recently built two-story houses. They found a number of devices as well as grenades, which can only be obtained through the military. The devices were removed from the site and rendered safe, according to Dorschner. As children rolled by in wagons, Tom Cole told CNN affiliate KUSA about how he had heard him doing metalwork into the night. ""There were many times this goes on until 9 o'clock at night, and you hear a grinder,"" Cole said. Another neighbor, Michelle Chalupa, told CNN affiliate KMGH her children had ""talked to (Sandberg) before (and) he seemed like a very nice guy."" ""It's so scary,"" she said. ""... I'm thankful that whatever operation found it before somebody was hurt.""","Richard Sandberg, 35, is arrested in a Denver suburb by federal authorities .

"New York (CNN) -- The remains of three women found on a remote stretch of beach in Long Island, New York, do not include those of Shannan Gilbert, whose search led to the investigation of a possible serial killer. Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, has been missing since May and was last seen alive in the Gilgo Beach area. As authorities searched for clues concerning her disappearance last year, they uncovered a total of eight corpses found in various stages of decomposition. A woman's body was found March 29 off Ocean Parkway, west of Cedar Beach, police said. When medical examination determined they were not Gilbert's remains, the police continued to search. On Monday, they found the remains of three additional people. They have also since been determined not to be those of Gilbert, police said in a statement Tuesday. Gilbert's sister, Sheree Gilbert, told HLN's Nancy Grace Tuesday night she was surprised none of the victims were her sibling. ""When we at first found out in December the first body initially they had found could have been hers, we had already prepared ourselves, and we were just hoping the search would come to an end,"" Sheree Gilbert said. ""We just don't know where she is at this point and we don't want her to suffer. We don't want her to be lost somewhere, not ever found."" Police say the hunt for a potential serial killer continues, as does the search for Gilbert, who, like the women whose bodies have been found, advertised for prostitution services on such sites as Craigslist. The first four bodies were discovered stuffed into bushes on a quarter-mile stretch of waterfront property on Oak Beach, indicating ""they were dumped there by the same person or persons,"" said Richard Dormer, Suffolk County Police commissioner, in December. ""It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location."" The remains of the fifth body were found about a mile from where the other corpses were discovered, he said, refusing to disclose exactly where the three additional remains were found on Monday.

"(CNN) -- If Japanese starlet Minami Minegishi's shaven head and tearful mea culpa looked more like a disgraced samurai trying to retrieve his honor, then it owes much to Japanese pop phenomenon ""AKB48's"" military structure. Complete with four main divisions of girl performers, the J-pop sensation have their own theater training camps, a sub-corps of as many as 14 sister groups, a rigid order of succession and a strict code of conduct. The bubblegum empire even has foreign territorial ambitions, with a base set to be established in Singapore and sister groups now located in Indonesia, Taiwan and China. But on Friday, Minegishi's tearful admission that she had broken the group's ""no romance"" bushido revealed serious cracks in the faÃ§ade of J-pop's standing army. Shaving her head -- considered a ritual act of contrition in Japan -- Minegishi described her actions as ""thoughtless and immature"" in a four-minute video posted on YouTube that was viewed more than 3 million times. The Japanese weekly tabloid Shukan Bunshun had earlier reported that she spent a night at the flat of Alan Shirahama, a member of the boy band, ""Generations."" ""If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band,"" she said. ""Everything I did is entirely my fault. I am so sorry. ""I don't believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don't want to quit AKB48,"" she said before concluding the admission with a deep bow. The apology did little to assuage management, who withdrew Minegishi's commission, demoting her to ""trainee status,"" according to the band's blog. Meanwhile, the scandal has been avidly taken up by Japan's voracious tabloid media. ""It's perfect. It's an endless source of fodder to fill magazines and now they have one that went all Britney,"" said an industry source who asked not to be identified. AKB48 comprises four teams of around 20 members who rotate to play at the AKB48 theater in Tokyo's Akhibara, where the group takes its name. The concept allows one team to perform while the others tour, promote or record. With 88 members in the band, it is registered in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest band in the world. The brainchild of the group's Yasushi Akimoto, the bands have been a goldmine, grossing 16.28 billion yen ($212 million) in 2011 in CD and DVD sales alone, according to compiler Oricon. With American Idol style auditions that continually renew the ranks of the teams, the girls aged from14 to 20 either ""graduate"" to become solo artists within Akimoto's swelling stable of performers, or they simply take early retirement. ""Misbehavior,"" as it's deemed in the group, merits expulsion or in the case of Minegishi, demotion. The groups are now so popular that tickets for the daily performances are allocated on a lottery system. Akimoto says he wanted to create a concept where the audience could meet their idols, and the groups regularly hold ""handshake events"" where the audience gets to ""high-five"" the performers on the way into the show. While AKB48 may seemed to be pitched at Japanese teens, the audience is usually made up of Japanese salarymen -- a phenomenon not lost on Akimoto who has been criticized for sexualizing young women. Video clips show performers in skimpy miniskirts, passing food from mouth to mouth or taking baths together. ""It's the same as art versus obscenity,"" Akimoto told CNN. ""It's up to personal judgment on how we perceive it."" But with song lyrics that run: ""I want to take off my school uniform, I want to misbehave, You can do whatever you like, I want to experience adult pleasure,"" Akimoto has been accused of feeding the teen schoolgirl fetish. ""They're not reading their diaries,"" said Akimoto, defending the performers. ""It's about acting. ""For example, there's a song called Despised Love. This song is asking why junior high school kids kill themselves ... unless I take up the issues these girls are facing as a songwriter the issues won't get addressed. ""There are kids out there who want to take off their school uniforms and misbehave, and I'm depicting realities in their lives in which they wonder whether it's okay to think that way. ""I'm not forcing them. I'm picturing their private lives partly based on my imagination or newspaper articles or TV news reports. I watch what their generation is doing -- the issues of bullying, suicide, or traps with sugar daddies."" CNN's Alex Zolbert contributed to this report.","Shaven-headed star of J-pop sensation AKB48 makes tearful admission on YouTube .

"(CNN) -- In this winter of his disinterment, we pause to ponder if Richard III, the last Plantaganet king of England, was a victim of a pen poisoned by history controlled by his Tudor successors. As archeologists sort through a skull and bones found under an English parking lot and with DNA tests confirming the remains were Richard's, there is a call for a re-examination of his legacy -- which has mostly been shaped by Shakespeare's play Richard III. Shakespeare's Richard III is a ""rudely stamp'd,"" ""deformed, unfinish'd"" villain who ordered the deaths of anyone who stood between him and the throne, including his two young nephews. Richard III: The mystery of the king and the car parking lot . ""So wise so young, they say, do never live long,"" Richard III says in a sinister aside as he dispatches Crown Prince Edward, 12, and brother Richard, 9, to their deaths in the Tower of London. ""Off with his head!"" Richard shouts in Act III, sending Lord Hastings to the chopping block. Shakespeare's story evolved from a history penned by Sir Thomas More more than two decades after Richard died in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. It was the last fight in the War of the Roses, which ended with the ascension of Henry VII and the Tudors. The Tudors, who controlled More's world, had a vested interest in disparaging Richard and bolstering their family's claim to the throne. The Richard III Society has ""been working since 1924 to secure a more balanced assessment of the king and to support research into his life and times,"" according to the society's website. The recent excavation of the burial site that once was a church ""has raised the king's profile and provided us with new opportunities to make the case for 'Good King Richard,'"" the society said. Opinion: Richard still the criminal king . Richard III Society Chairman Dr. Phil Stone opined in a piece for CNN.com that a ""cursory reading of the known facts will show that the Tudor representation of Richard III, especially that in Shakespeare's well known play, just doesn't stand up."" As Queen Elizabeth advised Richard III in Shakespeare's Act VI: ""An honest tale speeds best, being plainly told."" ""It would make such a difference if people would start to look into the history of this much maligned monarch without the old prejudices,"" Stone wrote. ""Perhaps, then, they will see past the myth and innuendo that has blackened his name and find the truth."" You may not find a saint, ""but neither was he a criminal,"" Stone said. ""All but one of the so-called crimes laid at his door can be refuted by the facts."" That crime was the killing of the rival nephews, known in history as the ""Princes in the Tower,"" he said. And there are other suspects, including Henry VII or other Tudors. Radiocarbon dating, radiological evidence, DNA and bone analysis and archaeological result confirmed the remains found under the parking lot, the former site of Grey Friars church, were those of Richard III, researchers at University of Leicester told reporters Monday. Clues coaxed from the skeleton may shed ""a new light"" on the physical description of Richard III as a humpbacked man with a ""withered arm,"" which was used to support history's evil image of him, Professor Lin Foxhall, head of the University of Leicester's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, said. ""Our archaeological research does not tell us anything about the character of Richard III, and of course his physical condition and appearance were not a manifestation of his character, Foxhall said. Comparing the new archeological finds to history texts ""could end up re-writing a little bit of history in a big way."" One immediate discovery is that his skeleton does not have a ""withered arm"" as depicted by Shakespeare, the researchers said. While not humpbacked, he did suffer from ""severe scoliosis"" that appeared to start around the time of puberty, they said. The confirmation of Richard's remains may make no difference in the royal world, but it does mean the king will finally get a proper burial. His body will be reinterred in the Leicester Cathedral early next year. ""A hearse, a hearse, my kingdom for a hearse,"" more than a few punsters tweeted upon that news. The rehabilitation of Richard III moves ahead Tuesday when the Richard III Society unveils a ""new"" face for their hero based on facial reconstruction using the newly-found skull.

"(EW.com) -- Two Four characters on NBC's ""Smash"" are expected to leave the show -- and we suspect fans are not going to be disappointed. Philandering fiancÃ© Dev (Raza Jaffrey) and devious assistant Ellis (Jaime Cepero) will not be regulars in the show's second season, sources say. It's possible one or both actors could appear in an episode or two to wrap up their storylines, but that's it. The plan is to have neither character as a recurring presence in the show's new-and-improved second season. Dev annoyed fans by cheating on Karen (Katharine McPhee) while Ellis infuriated viewers all season with his overeager meddlesome scheming. Fans and critics have been pretty outspoken that the second season would be better off without either character (Ellis, in particular) and it seems producers and/or NBC listened. NBC plans to return ""Smash"" in midseason, giving time for new showrunner Josh Safran (""Gossip Girl"") to creatively polish the series. NBC had no comment. UPDATE: Brian d'Arcy James, who played Julia's (Debra Messing) husband Frank, and Will Chase, who played Julia's former lover Michael, are leaving ""Smash,"" too.

"(CNN) -- Voters in Byron, Maine, have unanimously rejected a proposed law that would have required each household in the 140-person town to own a firearm and ammunition. Even the official who proposed the requirement, Selectwoman Anne Simmons-Edmunds, voted against it, saying she did so to have it reworked and reintroduced. ""We had some great ideas and great conversations. I think we will come back with a more comprehensive ordinance, maybe stronger wording for exemptions,"" she said, adding that about 50 people were at a town meeting Monday night and voted on the measure, all opposing it. ""I know they thought it was going to do well, but I didn't think it was,"" Selectman David Noise said of those who had supported the measure. Some in the community and at the meeting were strongly against the proposal, he said, even some that were gun owners. ""I didn't know how big this thing was going to be,"" he added. Simmons-Edmunds said that while a core group of townspeople were angry at her for proposing the law, the majority in the town liked it, but ""wanted it tweaked."" ""I would not want anyone telling me how to feel about something,"" Simmons-Edmunds said before the vote, ""and I don't expect others to get on board with me because I'm in favor of it."" The proposed ordinance had not included an enforcement component, she said. Senate panel agrees to new legislation on guns . Senator: Ordinance 'too much' Maine state senator and self-avowed National Rifle Association member John Patrick, who lives about 12 miles from Byron, told CNN Monday that the ordinance was ""too much."" ""I think the bill isn't necessary, especially in a small town,"" he said. ""I do have several guns myself, but if my neighbors don't want to, I don't think it's something that should go on the ballot."" Patrick added that this latest move in Byron came after a 2011 bill passed the state legislature prohibiting municipalities from creating their own gun laws. Study links gun laws and lower gun mortality . Other cities . Kennesaw, Georgia, passed a law almost identical to the Byron proposal back in 1982, requiring every household to own a firearm along with ammunition. On its website, the city attributes the drop in the crime rate since then to the law. The mayor and council in Spring City, Utah, passed a resolution encouraging each household to own a firearm in January, and offered city buildings to be used as gun-training locations. Another Georgia town unanimously approved a proposal to mandate gun ownership last week. Citizens of Nelson, Georgia, now have a chance to review the proposal before the council takes it up again in April. In the Nelson proposal, people with physical or mental disabilities are exempt from the law, as are ""paupers,"" felons, and those who oppose gun ownership based on belief or religious doctrine. Simmons-Edmunds said she had made mistakes in her proposal, which did not allow for any exemptions. She said she would like to exempt convicted felons, those with mental illnesses, and people with religious or moral reservations from firearm ownership. ""We basically wanted to send the message that our rights are ours and don't mess with our weapons,"" Simmons-Edmunds said Monday afternoon in advance of the meeting that rejected her proposal.

"(CNN) -- As recently as six years ago, it was conventional wisdom among lawyers, legislators and policy advocates that the states had no role in setting immigration policy. Since then, there has been a federalist revolution of historic proportions. One-third of the states now mandate that some employers enroll in the federal employment verification program, E-Verify. Seven states require it of all but the smallest employers. Five have enacted policing laws similar to Arizona's SB 1070 that allow local police to inquire about the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons who they suspect are in the country illegally. No wonder the Supreme Court is weighing in, hearing arguments this week on the Justice Department's challenge to SB 1070. Refereeing turf battles between Washington and the states is one of the court's first responsibilities. But something is troubling. The court is considering and will eventually rule on one very particular, polarizing state stratagem. That doesn't come across as impartial refereeing. Whatever the outcome, it will feel like judges making policy -- either endorsing or outlawing police questions about immigration status. If the justices are going to encourage federalism, I'd like to see them encourage it more evenhandedly, opening the way to a broader array of state initiatives, including those that go beyond enforcement. Those who want Washington to make immigration policy have a hundred years of history and a raft of persuasive arguments on their side. The Constitution reserves some powers for Congress: naturalization and, by extension, determining who and how many immigrants we admit. Federal law carves out other areas, including most worksite enforcement. And sheer practicality argues for one national policy on the border. But after five years of federal paralysis, with Washington still unable to act to fix the immigration system, it's understandable that states have been taking matters into their own hands. The laws have come in waves: One state tries something, others follow. The first waves were all enforcement measures: voters and lawmakers trying anything to get control, first by regulating landlords, then limiting hiring, then using local police and even public school teachers to inquire about people's immigration status. But recently, a handful of states have tried to go beyond enforcement. Utah pioneered the new path. Three-part legislation passed in spring 2011 combined an Arizona-like policing measure with a state-run guest worker program to bring in legal workers from Mexico, plus an initiative to grant work permits to unauthorized immigrants already living and working in Utah. This year, lawmakers in five other states as different as Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Vermont and California floated similar worker authorization bills. Legislators in many states express interest in guest worker programs. It's not just immigrant rights advocates who are driving the measures -- many are backed by surprising coalitions. In some instances, business is engaged. Even in the downturn, farmers, nonfarm seasonal employers and other industries that rely on physical labor need immigrants to do jobs for which there are few willing and able Americans. In some states, the sponsors are pragmatic conservatives. Republican state Sen. Curt Bramble of Utah is as eager as Arizona's enforcement-minded sheriffs to get control of illegal immigration. But Bramble believes it will take a combination of enforcement and realism about the unauthorized population. ""Most aren't going home,"" he says, ""no matter what we do. And the states are stuck with the costs. We have to educate, medicate and incarcerate them. But we can't let them work. It's the biggest unfunded mandate in history."" What's different in the states is that this kind of pragmatism can break through, and lawmakers aren't afraid to try experiments, even unlikely bipartisan experiments like Utah's worker authorization program. The problem for Utah is that the Obama administration, determined to limit states' rights and keep the lid on state immigration enforcement, hasn't let the state implement any of its initiatives. Unlike states pursuing enforcement alone, states seeking to combine enforcement with other measures can't simply take matters into their own hands. A state-run guest worker program can't bring legal workers across the border without cooperation from federal authorities. And without permission from Washington, a state-run worker authorization initiative would leave employers and employees dangerously vulnerable to federal immigration enforcement. The result is a dramatic asymmetry in the experiments in immigration policy being conducted in the laboratories of democracy. It's no accident that the Supreme Court, which many observers see as inclined to encourage state initiatives, is about to consider the merits of yet another enforcement measure. How do we get off this narrow path? How do we break the logjam where Congress is paralyzed, creative state lawmakers are stymied and the only people implementing new immigration policy are those seeking to use draconian enforcement to drive immigrants out of the United States -- a theory known as attrition through enforcement? Personally, I hope the Supreme Court will strike down the Arizona law and put the responsibility back on Congress' shoulders. But if it doesn't -- if the justices decide to empower the states -- I hope they and the administration will open the door as widely as possible, with the court ruling broadly to free the states, and the administration cooperating with some constructive state experiments. As many state lawmakers are starting to grasp, the best antidote to illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works. Let them experiment -- as freely as possible. Over time, their experimentation just may point the way for Congress.

"(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of ""waging war against God"" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles . Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor ""solidarity"" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. However, the government's direct targeting of women goes beyond chauvinism and is an integral part of a strategy to quell any momentum for larger internal reform. Women activists in Iran have worked for years at the ground level to promote internal change. Although Iran's women suffered a significant setback with the imposition of discriminatory laws following the 1979 revolution, an ease in restrictions during Mohammad Khatami's presidential term in the late 1990s and early 2000s allowed women to organize around reforms and emerge as a formidable grass-roots force in civil society. Women-led campaigns to collect signatures in support of reform of gender discriminatory laws and protest the stoning of women formed and grew rapidly, attracting many members and international attention. In the years that followed, women were often at the forefront of staging public protests. During the presidential election campaign in 2009, women activists, drawing on their grass roots and organizational experience, played a critical role in shaping and influencing the political platforms of the opposition candidates. So when the government set out to suppress the larger civil unrest that broke out in Iran's major cities after the election, it set its sights on a perceived catalyst for this unrest -- the well-established women's movement. In the mass indictments issued in August 2009 by Tehran's prosecutor general, women were identified as an element of an alleged ""soft"" revolution. Women's rights activists report that government interrogators warned them to cease their activities and accused them of supplying the political opposition with organizational and leadership skills and knowledge. Today the regime continues to systematically target the women's movement, whose leading campaigners are being silenced, imprisoned and exiled in increasing numbers. It's not sufficient for members of the international community to speak up only occasionally at the most shocking manifestations of the Iranian regime's targeting of women. Rather, a sustained, consistent and broader campaign must be waged that seeks to promote and give voice to the major catalysts of comprehensive human rights progress in Iran -- its brave women activists.
