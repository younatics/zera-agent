Desirable suburban areas with sky-high house prices suffer from a disproportionate number of burglaries, a survey of household thefts has revealed. Chorlton, in Greater Manchester, home to a large number of upmarket shops and bars, has more burglaries than anywhere else in Britain, with almost one in 20 people saying they have suffered a home invasion. Herne Hill and Muswell Hill, well-heeled suburbs of London where the average house price is more than £600,000, came second and third on the list of the country's top 20 burglary hotspots. Scroll down for the full list and Video . Burglary capital: London had the highest rate of burglaries with 12 out of the 20 worst areas . Hotspots: All of the top 10 postcodes were in cities, but 20th-placed was in Buckinghamshire . A spokesman for MoneySupermarket.com, which compiled the figures, said that burglars like to target wealthy areas as homes there are more likely to have desirable objects to steal. Its staff examined more than three million insurance quotes for burglary over the course of a year, noting where and when people declared they had been burgled before. The M21 postcode was the worst-hit with 45.2 claims per thousand people, or one in 22. SE24, in south London, was close behind - followed by the leafy north London suburb of Muswell Hill, home to middle-class icons like opera singer Lesley Garrett. Low crime: The area with the lowest number of burglaries was Basingstoke in Hampshire . More than half the postcodes on the . top 20 list were from London, including trendy neighbourhoods in the . east of the city such as Dalston, Hackney and Stoke Newington. Perhaps most surprisingly of all, the number 20 spot was taken by a clutch of sleepy towns in Buckinghamshire. Out . of all 20 postcodes featured on the list, all but three have house . prices which are higher than the national average of £176,000, according . to data from property website Zoopla. Suburban: But Chorlton-cum-Hardy in Manchester is the UK's worst burglary hotspot . Some relatively rural areas proved to be the safest spots in Britain - the Hampshire towns of Basingstoke, Chandler's Ford and Havant topped a list of the postcodes with the fewest burglaries. Bideford in Devon, the East Riding of Yorkshire and beauty spots on the Scottish coast were also listed among the least crime-ridden areas. Kevin Pratt, from MoneySupermarket, said: 'While the M21 postal district in Manchester is the country's most notorious burglary claim hotspot, it is London that dominates the top 20 rankings. 'But just because somewhere is named a claim hotspot, it doesn't actually mean the area in question is not a nice place to live. 'Thieves often target areas with wealthy residents and desirable properties where the rewards are potentially greater or quieter areas where they think there is less risk of being caught red-handed.' 1.

A historic chapel is set to be restored following centuries of neglect, after it was sold by the Queen for just £1. St James's Church stands in an abandoned hamlet on the banks of the River Wye, and came close to falling apart as the area became wild and overgrown. But the Crown Estate, which manages £8billion worth of land belonging to the royal family, has sold it for a nominal sum on condition that it is returned to its former glory. Historic: St James's Church in the abandoned hamlet of Lancaud, Gloucestershire has been sold by the Crown Estate for just £1 . Setting: The church can be seen at the centre of this photograph of the bucolic landscape which surrounds it on the banks of the River Wye . The church, in the now disappeared village of Lancaut in Gloucestershire, has been bought by the Forest of Dean Buildings Preservation Trust. They will spend £50,000 to 'stabilise' the 12th-century church, whose origins lie in the Anglo-Saxon period, and preserve it for future generations. Trust chairman Jim Chapman said: 'It is a hugely important building and its isolation is one of its joys. 'There was once a little community there. Traces of former buildings can be identified and there are headstones in the churchyard. 'But now it just looks idyllic, like a little snapshot of days gone by.' Empty: The roof has been stripped off the church and all of the fittings removed since it fell out of use in the 19th century . In trouble: For decades the church, pictured her in 1985, has been propped up by wooden beams against its walls . Renovation: Ian Standing from the Forest of Dean Buildings Preservation Trust, which has bought the building for £1 and pledged to restore it . The church, believed to be one of the oldest buildings in Gloucestershire, is being examined by officials from English Heritage. Restoration experts will be brought in to plan how the church can be saved for future generations. The Trust has already secured funding from an environmental trust to enable builders to carry out a programme of stabilisation. Mr Chapman said: 'It is an important and valuable asset - its roots are certainly pre-Norman and perhaps even earlier. 'We hope further investigation will reveal significantly more of its ancient past.' Aisle: The church fell out of use after the hamlet of Lancaud lost its final remaining inhabitants and was abandoned . Decline: St James's Church pictured in 1865, shortly before it stopped hosting services . Work: An earlier attempt at preventing the building from falling apart is pictured in 1986 . Historical sources suggest that there was a church at Lancaut as early as the year 625, although the present building was constructed in the 12th century, not long after the coming of the Normans to England. It is thought to have had some connection to nearby Tintern Abbey, a Cistercian foundation which was abandoned after the reformation and made famous by a William Wordsworth poem. One theory suggests that it may once have been a leper colony, which would explain the presence nearby of medicinal herbs such as green hellebore. Vow: The trust bought the building from the Crown Estate on the condition that it preserve the church for future generations . Eerie: The abandoned church occupies an evocative and romantic setting . St James's Church is far from the first property to go on the market for just £1 - but most of ultra-cheap homes do not have such a storied past. A number of local councils have started selling off rundown houses for £1, in order to regenerate deprived areas by ensuring that enthusiastic new homeowners move in and renovate their properties. Last year, 35 derelict homes in Stoke-on-Trent were sold off for a nominal sum to buyers who pledged to do up the houses. A similar scheme in Liverpool allowed a taxi driver to move his family into a spacious new home after handing over £1 and promising to spend around £35,000 on refurbishing the place. A boarded-up house in a Welsh mining village was even cheaper, going on the market with a reserve price of nil - meaning the new owner could move in for free if he was willing to put a lot of work into it. The village of Lancaut had 10 houses in 1306, but in 1750 there were only two inhabited properties. By the 19th century the church . congregation was so small that services were only held in the summer . months. It was finally abandoned in 1865. The . roof and the interior fittings, together with the font, were removed, . while the elements chipped away at the building making it appear . increasingly desolate. The lead font can be dated to between 1120 and 1140 and is now in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Work on restoring the building is expected to start this summer. The hamlet now forms part of a nature reserve, with both the river . and the nearby woodland providing an important habitat for wildlife. Among . the animals found the Wye near Lancaut are porpoises, otters and . herons, while the forest is home to a number of rare plants, with the . absence of people allowing the area to become a natural haven.","St James's Church, on the banks of the River Wye, was built in the 12th century but has pre-Norman origins .

Manchester United have announced they have reached an agreement with Chelsea to sign Juan Mata - click here for full story. Jose Mourinho said it was Tuesday morning, two days after watching his team thump Manchester United and effectively end their title defence, that he first received indication Juan Mata might be leaving. Mourinho spent more than an hour on Friday patiently explaining the reasons why a £37million bid from United had been accepted for Mata, darling of the Stamford Bridge fans. There were several strands: there was what he called the human factor, that Mata did not specifically ask to go but a player of his quality cannot be expected to sit happily on the bench, only to be summoned for games like Sunday's FA Cup tie against Stoke. ‘This club care about people,’ he said. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho's press conference as he discusses Mata sale . Serious: Jose Mourinho said that the club 'cared about people', that's why Juan Mata was allowed to leave . Waving goodbye: Juan Mata will join Manchester United, subject to agreeing terms and passing a medical . There was the enormous fee, a record paid by Manchester United. ‘Chelsea sold a player for almost double and that’s fantastic,’ stressed Mourinho. They would have listened to similar offers from any club, he said, but knew United appealed to Mata. The Chelsea manager was not, he insisted, afraid the sale might haunt him. ‘No fears at all,’ he said. ‘We are convinced he is going to do well. We wish that. Nobody here is jumping because Juan is leaving.’ Mourinho saluted the attitude of the Spain schemer, who has started only half of Chelsea’s games in the Barclays Premier League in a World Cup season yet conducted himself superbly. Adamant: Mourinho insisted he had 'no fears at all' that selling Mata would come back to haunt him . Underlying it all, however, was the feeling January has turned into a big month in the evolution of Mourinho’s new side. Out have gone Mata and Kevin de Bruyne, with Ryan Bertrand and possibly Michael Essien sent on loan. In have come Nemanja Matic, a strong and athletic central midfielder, and Mohamed Salah, a quick and industrious counter-attacking winger. Both fit snugly into an archetypal Mourinho team. Chelsea have no issue with the controversy surrounding Salah’s refusal to shake hands with Isreali team Maccabi Tel Aviv in a Champions League qualifier last year. ‘People have the right to be who they are,’ said Mourinho. ‘We are ready to help him.’ Controversy: New Chelsea signing Mohamad Salah refused to shake Maccabi Tel Aviv players' hands in both Champions League qualifiers last year, instead using his fist . No worries: But Mourinho said there was no issue, insisting they would help the player . The Chelsea manager, fired by Roman Abramovich in September 2007 after months of bickering about player recruitment, seems to have found, for the time being at least, a happy understanding with the owner. Like the fans, Abramovich also adores Mata, perhaps the individual who symbolises the efforts to impose a more artistic and creative brand of football on Chelsea. By selling to United, he has not only backed Mourinho’s short-term judgment and but also his ability to construct a better team than David Moyes over time. ‘He’s the boss,’ said Mourinho. ‘I belong to the board. I come behind. I give opinions and I justify my opinions. We all participate. We all have an opinion. Everybody knows where they’re experts and where they’re not. I am only an expert in football… and only when I win. ‘We analyse everything in every perspective. From an economic point of view, it was a fantastic offer. From a scouting point of view, we could immediately identify two or three who could replace him — not direct replacement because Juan is Juan, a champion. FFP: The move for Salah represents a step in a different direction for Chelsea, even though boss Roman Abramovich adored Mata . I'm yours: Mourinho said that he belonged to the board, and that they were all working together for the best of the club . ‘Purely as a football decision, I prefer to keep Juan because he can help us achieve important objectives. But we shared our  opinions and I’m comfortable with that. We cannot sell for £50m and buy for £48m. We have to sell for £20m and buy for £5m. ‘This is the kind of situation discussed by a group with different philosophies but a common interest: what is the best for Chelsea?’ Matic and Salah are not eligible for the Champions League but Mourinho claimed the evolution of his team was too important to prefer to a player less suitable in the long run but eligible for Europe. ‘We are prioritising the evolution of the team, the future of the team,’ he said. ‘The most important thing is we build the right squad, choose the right player, try and complete the puzzle in the next summer or two transfer windows. We don’t want to complete the puzzle in five windows, in December 2018.’ New model: Ashley Cole (left) and Frank Lampard aren't getting any younger and their contracts exprire soon . Unsettled: Mourinho didn't think Mata's departure would open a door for United forward Wayne Rooney . Key to the evolution is the recruitment of more English players to fulfil the home-grown quotas in the Premier League and UEFA squad lists, especially at a time when John Terry, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole soon to be out of contract. Asked if the Mata transfer might help him sign Wayne Rooney, Mourinho replied ‘I don’t think so.’ But he has young English players Luke Shaw and Ross Barkley in his sights, too. In this new era of give and take, the Chelsea manager has accepted the club policy that Terry, Lampard and Cole will, like all over 30s, be offered one-year contract extensions. It means they risk losing the trio to more attractive offers. The future? England youngsters Ross Barkley (left) and Luke Shaw are looked at as long-term investments . End of the road? John Terry's future in doubt... but Jose still has faith in the centre-half . But Mourinho said: ‘The rule is the rule and it is no problem if you live in a climate of trust. If you don’t, you can leave the player wondering “Is this my last year?” or the club asking “Is the player running to another club?”’ Mourinho said he wanted to keep Terry and added: ‘I trust him and I think he trusts me. I know where we want to arrive. Until January 31, we have lots to think about and to do. After that, in a calm way, we are going to analyse. The players know what we feel.’","Mourinho says Abramovich and himself worked together over selling Mata .

The parents of a four-year-old heart patient who died after 'shambolic' care at Bristol Children's Hospital have demanded a public inquiry after a coroner ruled that staff had not neglected him. Steve, 47, and Yolanda Turner, 45, from Warminster in Wiltshire, said they found evidence about their son Sean's treatment 'shocking and unacceptable', adding that only a public inquiry would answer their questions. At the end of the 10-day inquest yesterday, Avon coroner Maria Voisin recorded a narrative conclusion, saying that although there were 'lost opportunities' in Sean's care, they did not amount to neglect. Plea: Steve and Yolanda Turner (left) told the inquest how they had begged doctors and nurses on Bristol Children's Hospital's Ward 32 to help their desperately ill son Sean (right) Robert Wooley, chief executive of the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, apologised to Mr and Mrs Turner, and insisted changes had been made following Sean's death. The couple had earlier branded Sean's care 'shambolic' and told the inquest how they had begged doctors and nurses on Ward 32 to help their desperately ill son. Mrs Turner, a foster carer, told BBC Breakfast she wanted a public inquiry into her son's death. 'Sean suffered a lot of failings in his care. We feel at every level the ward did not recognise his deterioration and that led to the complications that led to his death,' she said. 'We feel there is much more that needs investigating and the coroner's inquest didn't do that fully.' Her husband, a carpenter, added: 'I think we feel now that the coroner was very weak. We wished she would have done some letters of recommendation to the trust...We feel that Sean was treated very poorly.' Care: Sean, shown here on holiday in Spain, died in part due to poor nursing, according to his parents . Hopeful: Sean, left, from Warminster, in Wiltshire, excitedly told friends that doctors were going to 'mend his heart' but he later died. His parents (right) called his care 'shocking and unacceptable' 'We are pleased they have made changes within the hospital. We just feel they should have been imposed while Sean was in there,' he said. 'They obviously weren't in place when Sean was in there because they wouldn't have spent £1.3 million on it so soon after Sean... All we've ever wanted is the truth and we only want the hospital to be truthful with us that they failed Sean, and they did fail Sean.' During the inquest, Mr and Mrs Turner gave harrowing accounts of their son's care and treatment during a six-week stay at the hospital, which is regarded as a centre of excellence. They said Sean was so desperate for a glass of water that he resorted to sucking the moisture from tissues used to cool his forehead. Mr and Mrs Turner accused doctors of transferring their son to Ward 32 from intensive care too soon and said they missed the signs of his worsening condition - with rising blood pressure, vomiting and fluid loss from his chest. Sean, who was born with a congenital heart defect, died in March 2012 from a brain haemorrhage after previously suffering a cardiac arrest - six weeks after undergoing vital corrective heart surgery. Four-year-old Sean Turner died after 'shambolic' care at Bristol Children's Hospital (pictured). His parents have demanded a public inquiry after a coroner ruled that staff had not neglected him . His parents claim their son's death was not isolated and said other children with heart problems have died at the hospital. Together with the parents of seven-year-old Luke Jenkins, from Cardiff, Mr and Mrs Turner complained to the independent healthcare watchdog, the Care Quality Commission. The CQC carried out an unannounced inspection and issued a formal warning to the hospital about standards on Ward 32. A five-bed high-dependency unit has now been set up on Ward 32 and the trust commissioned its own independent review of paediatric nursing across the hospital with its findings implemented. Trust chief executive Robert Woolley apologised to Mr and Mrs Turner and said the trust always sought to improve services. 'The coroner has heard that their son Sean was born with a very rare and complex heart condition and was undergoing a procedure which carries a known risk of death,' he said. 'But the inquest has also highlighted some missed opportunities in the care we gave to Sean when managing his post-operative complications and shortcomings in our communication with the family. 'We are always improving our services and we have made significant changes since Sean was on the ward in early 2012.'","Sean Turner, 4, died after spending six weeks at Bristol Children's Hospital .

Aggressive, quick-tempered people are more than twice as likely to suffer a stroke, a study has shown. It found that having a ‘type A personality’ – indicated by behaviours including hostility, aggression, impatience and a quick temper – could raise the risk of stroke as much as smoking. Spanish scientists compared 150 adults who had been admitted to a stroke unit with 300 randomly selected healthy people from the same area. Personality increases stroke risk: Being aggressive, quick-tempered or impatient can raise the risk of stroke as much as smoking . The average age of the participants was 54. Their levels of chronic stress were assessed by looking at symptoms such as anxiety and depression, general wellbeing and behaviour patterns. Chronic stress is linked to a high risk of stroke, which kills around 67,000 Britons a year, and personality traits can have a big effect. Biological risk factors, including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol were assessed for the study, as well as lifestyle factors such as caffeine and alcohol intake, smoking, and if the participant had a partner and job. The study, published online in the Journal of Neurology, Neuro-surgery and Psychiatry, showed that having a high score on the stress scale - indicative of a type A  personality - more than doubled stroke risk. A history of smoking also increased the risk two-fold. Those with aggressive, stress-prone . personalities were found to be particularly at risk irrespective of . other factors, including gender and an unhealthy lifestyle. Risk of stroke was also almost four times higher among those who had experienced a major life event, such as a bereavement, in the previous year, compared with controls. Dr Jose Antonio Egido, a neurologist at San Carlos University Hospital in Madrid, said: ‘Patterns of behaviour can reflect the capacity to adapt to a stressful life. ‘We found individuals with high levels of competitiveness and aggression are, following adjustment, 2.2-fold more likely to suffer a stroke compared with controls. ‘We did not observe gender having a significant effect on these findings.’ He said stroke was one of the principal causes of death worldwide, adding: ‘Addressing the influence of psychophysical factors [such as stress] on stroke could constitute an additional thera-peutic line in the primary prevention of stroke in the at-risk  population and, as such, warrants further investigation.’","Personality traits can raise the risk of stroke .

Gemma Smith, 35, claims she told hospital staff three-day-old son Fletcher Kennedy was grey, grizzly and not feeding properly but a Lancashire maternity unit believed he was fine and discharged them. Just a few hours later Gemma was watching TV with Fletcher's father Sean Kennedy when the infant made a noise in his Moses basket as if he had taken his last breath, she said. She desperately gave her son mouth-to-mouth and he was rushed into a different hospital but was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.

But a coroner has ruled that doctors were right to send a newborn baby home, even though the child died just eight hours later. 'He was grey in colour he just looked poorly. He would only settle if he was upright, he seemed uncomfortable. We had to keep him upright all the time,' she told the hearing . 'When he was born on the Thursday he was a lovely pink, big chunky baby. On the Saturday he was a totally different baby. 'He had been grizzly all night. He looked a totally different baby. Everyone commented that it was not the same baby. I had a photo of him taken that morning, he was not looking a healthy pink colour he looked grey. 'Everyone thought I was putting pictures of him up after he had died, I said no that was before.' Tender: Fletcher's father Sean kisses his son in the minutes after his birth but he later turned grey and grizzly, his parents said . Bereft: Gemma Smith, pictured while pregnant with Fletcher, said within 24 hours of returning home her son was distressed and struggling to breathe . Moving: Fletcher's mother said 'all of a sudden I heard him make a noise', which she told the hearing sounded like his last breath . The hearing was told Fletcher had been born on February 14 last year weighing 7lb 7oz and at 39 weeks after Miss Smith underwent a Caesarean section, as she had done when giving birth to her two previous children. Miss Smith was told by midwife that upon his birth Fletcher looked healthy but he had a low set of ears and a small chin and a fat pad on the back of his neck. The secretary from Burnley said: 'I was a bit shocked because I have read up on all sorts of things when pregnant and I had never heard of a low set of ears. I asked if it was a problem and she said that he would need to be referred to paediatrician. It was only briefly mentioned, when the paediatrician came round to do the checks I mentioned it and he said 'no it's fine - no concerns'.' 'Fletcher was feeding fine for the first 24 hours. He was brilliant, he took it every two hours, he was perfect. But he gradually stopped over the next 12 hours. He didn't want to know, by Friday evening he wasn't feeding, he was constantly crying. He was very, very unsettled he wasn't feeding at all.' Blame: The parents say staff at Burnley General Hospital should not have discharged the baby when he was struggling to feed . The inquest was told Gemma told a midwife her son wasn't feeding but added: 'She said that the baby of this size was a bit hit and miss with breastfeeding and to carry on persevering because he had fed. 'I was getting stressed. I thought he must be hungry. They said it was quite normal not to feed they didn't seem concerned. I wanted to breastfeed, this was the first baby who actually took to it.' Family: Sean with Fletcher in hospital where he was born via C section and there were no concerns or any difficulties within the pregnancy . She added that the nurses put it down to the baby being 'windy.' Miss Smith said: 'How can I have a windy baby if he has not eaten? I don't remember him passing urine. I told the nursing staff he was wasn't weeing. 'I monitored his nappies, on the 15th I kept three nappies at the bottom of the bed. I asked the midwife to check them, they were bone dry but she said they felt alright and threw them in the bin. All they kept saying, he had wind. That's what they put it down to.' The hearing was told hospital notes claimed Fletcher was passing urine and 'gulping milk.' Further notes taken later recorded noth mother and baby were sleeping following breast feeding and at 3.40am that Fletcher had been unsettled for a few hours. The inquest heard hospital notes recorded the baby being 'a good colour, clear eyes and skin'. Gemma was discharged from hospital at 4pm on  February 16 and family visited later that evening. But she said: 'Nothing settled him. I sent Sean to go and get some milk. He wasn't feeding, he was still crying lots. We got him a bottle. He didn't take the bottle, he wasn't opening his mouth, he was pushing away. He was a really funny colour.' The couple decided to bath him to try and settle him. Miss Smith said: 'He seemed to cry less but obviously he was on a downward spiral. It wasn't a cry, it was more of a dull cry, he was whimpering. I thought 'we have cracked it, it seems to be calming down'. We decided to stay downstairs with him that night.' She added that he was placed in a Moses basket and they watched him and Sean watched a film in the early hours of February 17. Miss Smith said: 'I could hear him making a noise, all of a sudden I heard him make a noise (demonstrated like a last gasp of breath). I said to Sean to ring the ambulance he has stopped breathing. I whipped him up. I was trying to blow into his mouth trying to give him air. I knew from picking him up he had just gone limp.' Innocent: Gemma and Fletcher were discharged from hospital on February 16 last year but the next day he fell ill and an ambulance was called . He was taken to Blackburn Hospital where he died at 3.01am after attempts to resuscitate him. Neonatologist Dr Chi Ning Mo claimed in a medical examination Fletcher appeared healthy. Dr Mo said: 'I found him to be a well looking baby, he had been reported to be breastfeeing well, he was pink. 'He did have a heart murmur but normal heart sounds, no breathing difficulties, liver not enlarged. He did not look to have any unusual features.. 'He didn't strike me as unusual in any way. He cried when he was disturbed but did settle once given something to suck. He behaved as a newborn baby would do'. Midwife Lola Wild said: 'Nobody raised any concerns to me about the baby's colour. After 24 hours they can become paler, it's not uncommon, the only difference I saw was the large fat pad on the back of the neck, other than that he seemed healthy to me and I had no other concerns. 'I have no recollection of Gemma raising concerns about her or her baby. We would advise to save the nappies if parents have got concerns I don't recall seeing them.' Returning a death by natural causes East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor: 'Indeed the loss of a child is always a terrible thing whatever the age of the child, but in four-days of life, our hearts go out to you. 'What then occurred after the first 24 hours with Fletcher, as in mum's evidence was he did well with feeding and sleeping but then concerns were expressed of lack of wee, feeding and sleeping. It is very noticeable that none of the health care specialists thought these concerns were worthy of note or delay in discharge. 'I didn't find that it was unreasonable to discharge Gemma and Fletcher. No one suggested there should've been any delay after checks on him. The conclusion I have to return is one of natural causes, all we can say is that it was an unknown medical cause, the medical cause of death was not fully established.' Speaking after the inquest Fletcher's dad, Sean Kennedy 27, said: 'If I have another child there is no way I'm going to believe the things they say but I'm sure they won't have this happening again. I hold the staff accountable for this, it is a total disgrace.' The inquest continues.","Mother of Fletcher Kennedy said his poor health was written off as'wind'

"EXCLUSIVEBy . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 04:59 EST, 23 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:38 EST, 23 January 2014 . Pitch: David Cameron said he wanted to make clear that Britain is open for business . David Cameron tonight vowed to make a 'sales pitch' to investors amid fears attacks by MPs on the tax affairs of global firms are deterring companies from doing business in Britain. MailOnline revealed that the Treasury is concerned about the impact of high-profile criticism of companies like Google, Amazon and Starbucks by Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee (PAC). The Prime Minister will use a speech to global business leaders in Davos tomorrow to make clear Britain is open for business. He is expected to trumpet that the coalition is cutting corporation tax rates to just 20 per cent, the lowest in the G7, tearing up red tape and investing billions in infrastructure to attract more firms. Mr Cameron will seek to counter the negative messages emerging from the PAC which has resonated around the world. After a Treasury source told MailOnline there is 'no doubt' the attacks are having an impact on business, the CBI warned MPs against 'personal attacks'. Ahead of his major speech, Mr Cameron said he was in Davos to 'fly the flag for Britain and to attract investment to British shores'. He met with some of the largest investors into the UK including car firm Tata, which owns Jaguar Land Rover and British Steel, and Siemens which is investing in renewable and energy technology in the UK. He said he asked them: 'You’ve invested in Britain – we’ve had the biggest share of inward investment in Europe over the last couple of years – what more can we do to get more investment, more jobs?' He added: 'We are a very welcoming, open economy – that’s one of our sales pitches for Britain and I’m here to make that sale.' Global internet firms including Amazon, Google and Starbucks have faced the wrath of Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, but there are fears the attacks could deter other investors coming to the UK . The government faces a difficult balancing act between offering a low tax regime which appeals to international firms while also being seen to take action against companies which do not pay their way. Miss Hodge has used her role as chairman of the PAC to repeatedly accuse multi-nationals of ‘siphoning’ profits out of the UK to low-tax countries. She has called for a boycott of companies including Starbucks, Amazon and Google in protest at what she said was ‘immoral’ avoidance of UK tax. But senior ministers have been warned by business leaders that the sustained attacks on well-known companies are deterring some from moving their headquarters to the UK. Treasury source . A Treasury source told MailOnline: ’There is no doubt it is having an impact. 'We are trying to show we have one of the most competitive corporate tax regimes in the world, but the message is being sent out if you come here you will be exposed to this sort of criticism from Margaret Hodge and her committee.’ Some companies which have a lower public profile are nervous of being subjected to the scrutiny of their financial affairs. The source added: ’The head of a company looking to move here would see the way other people have been hauled in front of MPs and subjected to criticism and will think: “I’m not doing that.” ‘The likes of Starbucks and Amazon will always be here, but other companies looking at Britain are being put off the idea of moving their headquarters here because they fear the level of public exposure for behaving perfectly legally.’ Critics note that the amount of tax uncollected by HM Revenue and Customs rose to £35billion last year . 'We're not accusing you of being illegal, we're accusing you of being immoral.' November 2012""I think one should boycott these companies. I do actually think that is the right thing to do.' November 2012 urging customers to snub Starbucks, Amazon and Google‘Companies like Amazon should pay their fair share of tax based on their economic activity in this country and the profits they make here. Its behaviour is not only unfair, it is anti-competitive, putting British businesses that do pay their proper tax at a disadvantage.’ May 2013‘I think you do do evil. That is, you use smoke and mirrors to avoid paying tax.’ May 2013, referring to Google's slogan 'Don't be evil'‘Why have you not litigated against one single internet company? Make a few cases, a few show cases. It’s so bloody obvious.’ October 2013, urging HMRC to take the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook to court . There is particular concern about the effect of the PAC’s attacks in the US, where it is viewed as being as influential as powerful congressional committees which hold sway over major decisions on tax and spending. Katja Hall, CBI Chief Policy Director, said: 'It is right to have high levels of scrutiny into the activities of businesses, and companies recognise the increasing level of public interest in many areas of their operations. 'Any questioning into business  activity should be robust, fair and professional, and should not turn into personal attacks.' The unease was hinted at by Treasury minister David Gauke in a speech last year when he said it was ‘quite understandable’ that companies would be put off moving to the UK if they are ‘worried that their reputations will be unfairly damaged’ and if ‘perfectly legal and perfectly legitimate behaviour might be presented to the public as something different’. Mr Gauke said: ‘Tough action on tax avoidance, yes. But we must also recognise that if the debate is driven by myths and misunderstandings, we could risk jobs and investment in the UK.’ However, Miss Hodge insisted that she would be ‘completely robust’ in challenging any suggestion her committee’s work was damaging investment. Companies looking to relocate look at a range of factors, including the skills base of the workforce, the potential and whether employees would see it as a good place to live and work. ‘There is a range of issues and tax is just one,’ she added. ‘To be absolutely honest I think if we don’t get this right, if we don’t get the tax from one set of people we have got to find it from others and you end up damaging British companies with British workers. ‘I think it’s a completely fallacious argument that I am happy to have with them because I think they are wrong.’ David Cameron at the Davos summit last year took a swipe at Starbucks, saying companies had to 'wake up and smell the coffee' and pay the right tax, but this week he will present a more upbeat message to investors . While Ms Hodge’s committee has launched a sustained campaign against large companies’ tax arrangements, ministers have also joined the chorus of disapproval. A year ago at the Davos summit Mr Cameron appeared to single out Starbucks when he said ’companies need to wake up and smell the coffee’ and realise that customers wanted them to pay their way. The Prime Minister is expected to strike a very different tone when he returns to the gathering of global business and political leaders, instead emphasising efforts to attract investment into the UK. Chancellor George Osborne has repeatedly cut corporation tax - which is paid on the profits companies make - in order to persuade more foreign firms to set up the HQ in the UK. ‘The best way to help businesses is by lowering the burden of tax’, he said last month as he published data showing reducing the corporation tax rate actually increased the amount of money raised for Treasury coffers. When the coalition was formed it stood at 28 per cent but in April this year it will be 21 per cent, falling eventually to 20 per cent. Downing Street defended the right of Miss Hodge's committee to challenge companies about their tax affairs. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'Committees and their business, that’s for them. What the Government is focused on of course is around the economic conditions which encourage inward investment into this country. How committees do their business, that’s for them.'","Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge is accused of deterring investors .

Sportsmail's Matt Barlow has everything you need to know about Chelsea's new signing Mohamed Salah - dubbed the 'Egyptian Messi' Chelsea's £11million move for Egypt winger Mohamad Salah is mired in controversy after it emerged he has twice refused to shake hands with Israeli players. Owner Roman Abramovich, chairman Bruce Buck and director Eugene Tenenbaum are all Jewish and will be concerned by Salah’s actions. The Basle star, who will join Chelsea this weekend after completing a medical, refused to shake the hands of Maccabi Tel Aviv’s players in both legs of their Champions League qualifiers last year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mohamed Salah refusing to shake hands with Israeli players . Controversy: New Chelsea signing Mohamad Salah refused to shake Maccabi Tel Aviv players' hands in both Champions League qualifiers last year, instead using his fist . Done deal: Chelsea have signed Basle's Mohamed Salah, who has scored twice against them this season . Jose Mourinho was quick to play down the incident on Friday. 'It's not a concern. We know the club Chelsea is. I know the manager I am,' he said. 'There are no problems with us. We know what owner we have and the variety of players we have. We can help a young boy grow up and be stable.' Before the clash with Maccabi at St . Jakob-Park on July 30, Salah left his boots by the side of the pitch and . avoided the customary pre-match handshake by going to the touchline to . change into them. Basle won the game 1-0 and flew to Israel for the . return leg on August 6. Salah, . 21, then avoided the customary handshake with Maccabi’s players before . kick-off, but clenched his fist instead to make contact with each member . of the opposition. He went . on to score his side’s second goal on the way to a 3-3 draw that . ensured Basle qualified for the Champions League group stages under . impressive coach Murat Yakin. Salah’s actions will cause some . discomfort to Chelsea’s hierarchy. Abramovich is a frequent visitor to . Israel and sponsors many charitable causes in the country. Gazumped: Jose Mourinho's side beat competition from Liverpool for the £11m Egyptian forward . But Salah would counter any suggestion of anti-Semitism, saying he felt pressurised to appease some extreme sections of the Egyptian community. Despite his controversial behaviour, Chelsea intend to press ahead and confirm his signing after the sale of Juan Mata to Manchester United for £37m. They have agreed a fee with Basle and the move will be completed as soon as Salah has passed a medical in Switzerland. Salah is a regular in the Egypt national team and has scored 17 times in 27 appearances. On his way out: Chelsea midfielder Juan Mata will be allowed to leave the club by Jose Mourinho . He came to Chelsea’s attention last . season with some mercurial performances in the Europa League against . Tottenham and later against Rafa Benitez’s side in the semi-final, when . he scored in the second leg. Salah was also on target against Chelsea in both of this season’s Champions League group games against Jose Mourinho’s side. During his career with Basle he scored 20 times in 78 games and his form in front of goal has helped him win a move to Stamford Bridge. Well-known threat: Salah also scored for Basle in last season's Europa League semi-final against Chelsea . If you can’t stop ’em, buy ’em, right? Seems so. Chelsea lost home and away against Basle in the Champions League this season, with Salah on target in each game. He scored the only goal at St Jakob-Park having out-sprinted Branislav Ivanovic. So, quick then? Sure is. He is comfortable on either wing, has good balance, sound technique, dribbles well, goes past defenders, has terrific acceleration and is especially dangerous on the break. He also bears a passing resemblance in looks and busy style to Jermaine Pennant. But he’s better than Jermaine Pennant, right? There’s probably more purpose and end product, granted, and he gave Ashley Cole a torrid time at Stamford Bridge. Salah has responded to subsequent steps up in class through the European competitions. So, why hasn’t he been snapped up sooner? He has been heavily scouted by PL teams. Liverpool were keen but Chelsea have been able to scrutinise his progress since the teams met in last year’s Europa League semi-final.

Eric Boullier is set to replace Martin Whitmarsh as McLaren team principal after resigning from his role at Lotus. Read the full story. It was a launch that said everything about the plight of bedraggled McLaren: no title sponsor, no team principal, one venerable driver and one rookie. That is about the reality of the sorry production from the team's headquarters in Woking today. It was all a far cry from the sumptuous launches of another richer and more hopeful era. Head on: This year's McLaren was unveiled on their official website in a low-key launch compared to past years . Bird's eye view: The MP4-29, which doesn't have a title sponsor, looks radically different from last year's car . There was no Cirque de Soleil to entertain the great and the good as there was a few short years ago in vibrant Valencia, where Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso were paraded as totems of McLaren's total ambition. ‘There has been a lot of negative press about the way the cars look but personally apart from the funny little bit at the front which is in the regulations, our car looks beautiful,' Jenson Button said. 'I think it looks really nice and we have done the best we could with the regulations that we were given. 'We don’t go out our way to make the car look pretty - it is about being quick - but the car needs to look good as well. The fans don’t want to see us drive around in a square box. The beauty is still there.' Head on: McLaren will hope this year's car is a vast improvement on the MP4-28 - which failed to score a podium finish . Admittedly the other teams have also gone for small launches, or none at all, because the massive technical regulation changes for the new season means they are in a mighty hurry to be ready in time for testing next week in Jerez, but one imagines that McLaren would still have staged a grander ceremony had they not been in their current predicament. Sad to say that while Whitmarsh was not here – he was on holiday in France pending his dismissal as team principal after Ron Dennis, the group chairman, took charge of F1 affairs as chief executive last week – the conequences of his dismal five-year tenure overlaid the launch of the MP4-29 chassis. Eric Boullier is the favourite to take Whitmarsh's place after the Frenchman this morning resigned from his post as team principal Lotus. If he is to be installed, it means Dennis has missed out on his supposed No 1 target Ross Brawn. New line-up: Jenson Button stands with team-mate Kevin Magnussen (left) and reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorn . Whitmarsh had long promised an 'exciting announcement' in December about a replacement for Vodafone. None came. Instead, last week Jonathan Neale, the managing director, said McLaren were nonetheless in a strong position owing to long-term sponsorship deals with Hugo Boss, Tag Heuer and Hilton. That is an impressive roster but it still felt like an excuse for failing to meet their stated objective. Whatever the Brawn/Boullier conundrum, one thing for certain is that Sam Michael will not be handed Whitmarsh's team principal's job as part of Dennis's review. A nice enough chap, the best we can say about his record in F1 is that it is patchy. But that's enough doom and gloom. For if last season's podium-free record and the dismissal of Whitmarsh was the nadir, at least a new season and Ron Dennis's declaration to, 'write an exciting new chapter in the story of McLaren, beginning by improving our on-track and off-track performance,' offers significant hope. Honda's arrival as engine partners next season is another massive fillip. But this new car, powered by Mercedes and with its long nose, will be struck up in Jerez on Tuesday, providing the first indication of whether 2014 can help banish McLaren's gloom. Contrast: Button competing in the MP4-29's predecessor at last year's Monaco Grand Prix .","McLaren unveil challenger for the new season in a low-key reveal at their HQ .

Carl Froch has claimed George Groves rejected a seven-figure payday to hold a rematch of the slugfest that ended so controversially last year - but prospects of a second bout appear good after the IBF ordered a rematch, to be fought within 90 days. Promoter Eddie Hearn revealed to Sportsmail this week that he hopes to stage the rematch in a stadium on either May 24 or May 31, but Froch revealed negotiations have hit a stumbling block. Sportsmail understands Groves earned in the region of £500,000 for their first compelling fight, which super-middleweight world champion Froch won via a controversial ninth-round stoppage on November 23. Best of enemies: Carl Froch (left) and George Groves (right) pictured after their controversial November bout . Battle-hardened: Froch was looking stonefaced after his victory against Groves in November . Read why Carl Froch's boxing promoter Eddie Hearn believes a rematch between the Cobra and George Groves MUST happen this year in his new fortnightly exclusive column. But an offer to double his money has . apparently been rejected by Groves, with Froch narrowing his future . options to either a Groves rematch or a bout in Las Vegas against Julio . Cesar Chavez Jnr. Froch . said: ‘There has been plenty of speculation over the last few weeks . regarding my future. As it stands we are looking closely at two options . George Groves and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr. ‘Yesterday . (Thursday), we made a seven-figure offer to George Groves for a second . fight that would have seen him earn around double that of the first. ‘Disappointingly, George rejected this offer so we are continuing our talks with Top Rank and HBO regarding Chavez Jnr. ‘I . understand the demand for the Groves fight in the UK, but also the . demand in the US for the Chavez fight. Talks are on-going and no doubt . some further news will break soon. I’m happy to fight anyone, as I have . done throughout my entire career.’ Groves . has repeatedly called out IBF and WBA champion Froch for a rematch of a . fight he was winning before the referee, Howard Foster, intervened. Groves on Friday issued a statement of his own to challenge Froch's . version of events and the IBF later ordered an . immediate rematch. Cut above the rest: Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (pictured) could be the next opponent for Froch . He said: 'I am unsure why Carl Froch has released a . statement implying I do not wish to take the fight, as I was under the . impression we are still in negotiations. The Matchroom offer in question . came with many stipulations and options I felt were unsatisfactory. 'I . am currently awaiting an improved offer from his promoter, as well as . speaking to other promoters interested in promoting this fight.' Groves . added: 'If I didn’t want to fight Carl Froch then I wouldn’t have . invested so much time and money into appealing with the IBF over the . dubious outcome of the first fight. I await the outcome of that hearing . in the very near future.' Hearn . revealed to Sportsmail that other fights under consideration for Froch . are a rematch against Andre Ward, who beat him in 2011, and Gennady . Golovkin, the middleweight world champion. Writing . on Twitter, Hearn said on Friday: 'IBF call for rematch for Froch v . Groves. Doesn't change much re CF's options but still hopeful of . agreeing terms with GG.' Possible opponents: Andre Ward (left) and Gennady Golovkin (right) could be potential fights for Froch . The IBF, meanwhile, said: 'After a fight our rules say a boxer has 10 days to file an appeal. Groves did that, and at a hearing on January 15 in Newark we had a three-man panel review all of the evidence and they came back with the decision we must order a rematch. 'The 90 day period starts from Friday, January 24 and I'm pretty sure Carl Froch will have already received notification. 'If he fails to defend the belt against Groves within this period it's more than likely he will lose his title. The fighters and their teams have a certain amount of time to come to an agreement and if they can't, it will come down to purse bids. 'If for some reason Froch gave up the title then we would order the two highest-rated guys to fight for the vacant belt. Since we already ordered Groves to fight Froch, he would be likely to be one of the guys to fight for that vacant title.' In that event, Groves would likely face the IBF's No 3 Brandon Gonzales.","Carl Froch claims George Groves rejected a seven-figure sum for a rematch .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:24 EST, 5 December 2011 . A £900million scheme to produce a computer system which could predict the next financial crisis has been backed by leading scientists. The Living Earth Simulator Project (LES) aims to 'simulate everything' on the planet, using anything from tweets to government statistics to map out social trends and predict the next economic crisis. Using vasts reams of data fed into the internet, trends can be spotted by analysing information with 'the world's most powerful computers'. Pre-empted: It is hoped the Living Earth Simulator will use vast amounts of data to predict impending financial crises . The man behind the idea has billed it as a 'nervous system for the planet', while academics have backed it as a replacement for current outdated economic models. Professor Dirk Helbing, one of the leaders of the project at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, told the Sunday Times: 'The idea is to gather live information from a huge range of sources and then analyse it using the world's most powerful computers. 'Many problems we have today - including social and economic instabilities, wars, disease spreading - are related to human behaviour, but there is apparently a serious lack of understanding regarding how society and the economy work. Professor Helbing said the LES would be able to predict the spread of infectious disease such as Swine Flu, identify methods for tackling climate change and even spot an impending financial crisis. It would be filled with huge swathes of data, which would be assembled as-yet-unbuilt supercomputer hardware capable of data analysis on a mammoth scale. Plan: The man behind the supercomputer, Professor Dirk Helbing, billed the machine as 'the nervous system for the entire planet' Around 30 leading computer science centres worldwide have already pledged their support for the supercomputer, including three in Britain. Oxford University, University College London (UCL) and Edinburgh University have also formed the FuturICT consortium to help push ahead with plans for the project. The European Commission has also put the Living Earth Simulator at the top of its shortlist for £900m in funding. However, the plans to recreate the entire world in a complex computer system have drawn criticism from some science experts who see the project as too ambitious and unrealistic. Iain Begg, professor of European Studies at the London School of Economics, told the Sunday Times: 'The complexity of the world is simply too great. We cannot even model the weather for more than a few days. 'The social domain, people's behaviour, is even harder to analyse, because social trends are not just complex, they also change with time. 'We have to be sceptical as to whether even the most powerful computers could cope with it.' The current economic crisis and eurozone meltdown was not foreseen by the financial models which most policy-makers use. But the Living Earth Simulator Project would pre-empt such a disaster, which is why it has been given support by the European Commission. Supporters of the supercomputer idea say the need to forecast another worldwide economic crisis is greater than ever. Inspiration?: The only similar machine which has ever been dreamt up was Deep Thought, the computer from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy . Steven Bishop, professor of non-linear dynamics at UCL's mathematics department, who is a key figure in the Living Earth Simulator project, said: 'The modern banking system may have more disasters waiting to happen but they are buried in complexity, just as happened with the crisis of sub-prime mortgages. 'We would hope to find the precursors of instability and disasters and maybe do that in time for politicians to stop them happening.' The only time a similarly ambitious computer scheme has been dreamt up was in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, where the satirically-created Deep Thought spent 7.5million years pondering the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.","Living Earth Simulator could predict the spread of disease and impending financial meltdowns .

The 73-year-olds' attempts to coax the three-metre-long animal to another part of her enclosure were caught on camera by Earth Touch News Network, who happened to be at the farm filming. Their dramatic footage shows him prodding the huge croc - and the croc snapping angrily back at him. Suddenly, the crocodile lunges forward and grabs his foot, sending Mr Watson tumbling to the ground and scrambling for his life.

'I had to protect my stomach and my throat… that could be fatal because it could tear my stomach out. I’m amazed my toe stayed on.’ He added: ‘My wife is bloody annoyed, if you get bitten around here, you get no sympathy.’ Crocodile Creek is home to around 7,000 crocodiles and snakes.","Peter Watson's attempts to move an adult crocodile were caught on camera .

British archaeologists have pinpointed when the original ‘pharaohs’ ruled Ancient Egypt for the first time. Using mathematical models, radiocarbon dating and archaeological evidence, researchers found the first ruler, King Aha acceded to the throne between 3111 BC and 3045 BC - up to five hundred years later than some previous estimates. A new timeline shows the original territorial state developed from primitive beginnings in as little as six hundred years. Archaeologist Dr Michael Dee, of the University of Oxford, said: 'There are no records before the third dynasty, so we have had to guess exactly when the vital First Dynasty, which led to the development of writing and agriculture, happened.' Samples were taken from the royal cemetery, Abydos (pictured) The pharaohs, who are understood to have started with King Aha, ruled Ancient Egypt for more than three thousand years and the story of the very last pharaoh, Cleopatra, is famous to this day. But it will be another thousand years before we are as far removed from her as she was from her earliest predecessors who remain shrouded in legends and conjecture, known only from a handful of frustratingly incomplete sources. Archaeologist Dr Michael Dee, of the University of Oxford, said: 'There are no records before the third dynasty, so we have had to guess exactly when the vital First Dynasty, which led to the development of writing and agriculture, happened.' The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society A, also found the Predynastic period when inhabitants along the River Nile started to form permanent settlements was probably closer to 3700 BC than 4000 BC, with the stone age Neolithic era preceding it lasting longer and finishing later. Dr Dee said: 'The origins of Egypt began a millennium before the pyramids were built, which is why our understanding of how and why this powerful state developed is based solely on archaeological evidence. Hor-Aha was the first king of the first dynasty . His name means 'fighting hawk' He is thought to be the founder of the capital city at Memphis . His tomb at Abydos is the largest in the north-western section of the cemetary . Legend has it he was killed by a hippo . Another says he was attacked by wild dogs and saved by a crocodile in the Faiyum and as a result, the city of Crocodilopolis was founded . 'This new study provides new radiocarbon dating evidence that resets the chronology of the first dynastic rulers of Ancient Egypt and suggests Egypt formed far more rapidly than was previously thought.' Aha is believed to have become pharaoh at the age of 30 and ruled until he was about 62. Legend has it that he was killed by a hippopotamus while hunting. His ‘chief wife’ was Benerib, whose name was written on his tomb at Abydos, but he also had another wife, Khenthap, with whom he became father of Djer, Egypt’s second king. Then came King Djet, Queen Merneith, King Den, King Anedjib, King Semerkhet and King Qa’a whose reign began between 2906 BC and 2886 BC. Dr Dee said they would have ruled over a territory spanning a similar area to Egypt today with formal borders at Aswan in the south, the Mediterranean Sea in the north and across to the modern day Gaza Strip in the east. Until now scholars had relied on archaeological evidence alone, using the evolving styles of ceramics (pictured) excavated at human burial sites to try to piece together the timings of key chronological events in the Predynastic period and the First Dynasty . Scientists have pinpointed when the original 'pharaohs' ruled Ancient Egypt for the first time. Older 'Petrie Sequences Dating Strips' are pictured . This is the first robust timeline for the first eight dynastic rulers of Egypt because until now there have been no verifiable records for this period or the process leading up to the formation of the state. The chronology of early Egypt between 4500 and 2800 BC has been reset thanks to more than 100 fresh radiocarbon dates obtained from hair, bone and plant samples excavated at several key sites including the tombs of the kings and surrounding burials. Egypt was the first territorial state to be brought under one political ruler and the new dating evidence suggests this period of unification happened much faster than previously known. Until now scholars had relied on archaeological evidence alone, using the evolving styles of ceramics excavated at human burial sites to try to piece together the timings of key chronological events in the Predynastic period and the First Dynasty. For example, among the most significant pieces of evidence surviving today are two mud seals excavated at the royal tombs at Abydos, containing lists in successive order of the First Dynasty kings. Using the fresh radiocarbon dates combined with existing archaeological evidence, the researchers’ mathematical model pinpointed the likeliest date for each king’s accession. The date for each king is thought to be accurate to within 32 years. The data supports a shortening of the Egyptian Predynastic; the period over which state formation occurred, to between 600 and 700 years. 'This finding accentuates a contrast with neighbouring southwest Asia, where the transition from cereal production to state formation took somewhere between four to five millennia,' the researchers said. 'It reinforces the suggestion that, despite their geographical proximity, prehistoric societies in Africa and Asia followed very different trajectories to political centralisation,' they added. Dr Linus Girdland Flink, co-author and postdoctoral research assistant at the Natural History Museum, London said the museum houses human remains from the First Dynasty royal tombs of Abydos, Egypt, many of which were excavated in the late 19th and 20th centuries. 'We were surprised to see how well preserved . the specimens are. Preservation of organic materials from hot desert climates . is usually poor but we were able carryout radiocarbon dating using organic residue . from most of the specimens.' He said Abydos is a key archaeological site for understanding the prehistory of Egypt as most of the early rulers are buried there. 'The remains housed at the Museum come from the burials of . courtiers who were likely sacrificed to accompany their king into the . afterlife. Importantly, this practice was unique to the First Dynasty and these . remains provide a unique opportunity to gain broad understanding of life during . that time.’ The Early Dynastic Period of Egypt immediately follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt and is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC. The capital moved from Abydos to Memphis in the First Dynasty with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king, but Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period.Before the unification of Egypt, the land was settled with autonomous villages but after the first ruler came to power the country came to be known as the Two Lands, where rulers established a national administration and appointed royal governors. The earliest hieroglyphs appear just before this period, though little is known of the spoken language they represent.","British archaeologists found the first ruler, King Aha acceded to the .

'Disgusted': Sonia Fowler says photos of her at last year's Christmas party inspired her to lose weight ahead of this year's festive bash . 'Someone put the pictures up on the wall at work and I just couldn't believe I looked that way. I just thought ""oh my God, is that really me?"". It was a real shock,' she says. It was the picture above, where Sonia is sitting at the table with her husband Glen, 56, that made her decide to change her lifestyle. 'The more I thought about it, the more I realised I didn't want to look this way by the next Christmas party. I was determined to do something about it.' Dazzlingly different: Sonia attended this year's Christmas party wearing a size 12 dress . Sonia vowed to lose weight by the time . the next Christmas party came around and decided to try the Cambridge Weight . Plan - a meal replacement programme. 'I just knew I couldn't go on the way I was. It was just so unhealthy,' she says. 'The nearer this year's Christmas party got, the more determined I was to lose weight. And when I finally hit my goal weight I was just over the moon. 'This year the Christmas party was amazing - I felt confident and happy - and I spent all night on the dance floor.' Sonia, pictured a cruise before the weight loss, was 'disgusted' when she saw pictures from the office party . Sonia tipped the scales at 19 stone 11lbs before she started her diet in January this year. 'Throughout my life, I have always felt the need to feel full,' she says. 'I'm one of four children so there wasn't always enough food to go around. I think it's because of this that I always made sure I had plenty of food, and why I over ate. I'd just gorge on pastries and bread and ended up being a size 26. 'It wasn't until my mum had a heart attack in 2010 that my unhealthy lifestyle started to sink in. Then I saw the Christmas party pictures and I finally realised I needed to change my ways.' Sonia's expanding waistline meant that she struggled to do even the simplest of things. 'I was so big I struggled to get in and out of bed. I couldn't manage the housework, I couldn't even get in and out of the bath on my own and I couldn't put shoes on - my husband, Glen, had to do this for me,' she says. 'Exercise was totally out of the question, my joints ached and I knew I was becoming depressed.' But remarkably, Sonia has managed to lose nine stone in a year and now weighs 10st 11lbs.

Within hours, hundreds of fans slammed the star’s record for its X-rated lyrics and ‘pornographic’ videos in which she twerks and dresses scantily. Scroll down for video . Beyonce faced a backlash on social networking sites over 'vile' lyrics and 'pornographic' videos on her new album released on Friday, to the surprise of fans . In the video for Partition the star is seen cage dancing and writhing on the floor . On social networking sites, the 32-year-old singer was called ‘vile’ and ‘disgusting’ for the provocative tracks, including songs titled Blow and Drunk in Love. Some users questioned whether she was a fit role model to millions of young fans. The star, who rose to fame in girl band Destiny’s Child, has often campaigned for women’s rights. But fans said she should now be ashamed of herself for  following in the footsteps of Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, who have shocked viewers with their erotic music videos. And they accused her of ‘cashing in’ on her one-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, who features in one of the clips. Campaigners and parents yesterday called for video sharing site YouTube, where the 17 videos can be seen, and iTunes, where the self-titled album of 14 songs costs £12.99, to ban the explicit content. Within hours of the stealth release of the star's fifth album, entitled Beyonce, people shared their disgust at songs including those titled Blow and Drunk in Love . Beyonce also came under fire with critics claiming she was 'cashing in' on her daughter Blue Ivy, who appears in the video to accompany the track Blue . Vivienne Pattison, of pressure group Mediawatch-UK, said last night: ‘This is such a shame to see because Beyonce didn’t get to where she is by jumping on the same bandwagon as Rihanna and people like that who we expect to be explicit and controversial. ‘She was the one we always thought we could count on to set a good example and keep producing music with powerful messages that empowered women and girls. ‘And I would have thought that a star of her magnitude wouldn’t need to do something like this. ‘She has sold out and it’s really sad. Like it or not Beyonce is a role model and she needs to take responsibility for that. Especially as a mother herself, it’s very surprising that she would do this. She added: ‘This is now on YouTube and children can see it. ‘It’s not like parents can protect their children by not buying the album. It’s there, on the internet, for anyone to access and as a parent that is incredibly worrying.’ Among the most shocking of the videos is Partition, in which Beyonce cage dances for her husband, 44-year-old rapper Jay-Z, before writhing around on the floor in her underwear. She sings about a rough sexual encounter taking place in the back seat of a car and refers to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Campaigners have called for the video sharing website YouTube where the 17 videos can be seen and iTunes, where the 14-track album can be purchased, to ban the explicit content . Vivienne Pattison, of pressure group Mediawatch-UK, said: 'This is such a shame to see because Beyonce didn't get to where she is by jumping on the same bandwagon as Rhianna and people like that who we expect to be explicit and controversial' In another song, called Blow, she describes being in a state of heightened sexual arousal. In the accompanying video she is joined by a troupe of nearly naked female dancers. One woman wears only a pair of knickers and stars on her breasts while others simulate lap dances with male performers. Concern was also raised over Blue, a tribute to Beyonce’s daughter Blue Ivy. In it the one-year-old is seen walking beside her mother. Pippa Smith of Safermedia said she was shocked at the ‘irrational’ decision to ‘expose’ the child to the eyes of strangers on the internet. She said: ‘To have her own daughter is a bit beyond the pale, no one in their right mind would do that. She’s far too young and Beyonce is exposing her to the views of all sorts of strangers which isn’t safe online, what with all the worry about online predators. ‘It’s a very, very stupid thing to do and not rational at all. ‘My view would be that the whole album should be banned. Even with age ratings it would still circulate round the playground and it’s sheer exploitation.’ Beyonce released 30-second clips of the 17 new music videos without warning on Friday . In other videos on the album, released on Thursday night, Beyonce wears skimpy outfits as she performs among semi-naked dancers, some with whips. She also becomes the latest singer to engage in ‘twerking’ – a raunchy hip thrusting dance move that came to public notice when former Disney child star Miley Cyrus performed it this summer. Beyonce repeatedly refers to sex and alcohol and makes frequent use of the word ‘b*****s’. Yesterday, one Twitter user wrote: ‘Jeez! Beyonce has left me flabbergasted. Like I never expected her to be this explicit.’ Another said: ‘The fact Blue Ivy has parts on Beyonce’s new album might be the most disgusting thing I’ve ever heard. Way to exploit your baby for money.’ A third added: ‘Shame on you Beyonce.’ Earlier this year Beyonce was criticised for performing at a Chime for Change concert, which raised money to support women’s rights, in a tight leather bodice. But her dramatic image shift began in February when she sang at the US Superbowl in a tight black leotard and fishnet tights. Mrs Smith said: ‘It just doesn’t seem right. You get these beautiful young singers with amazing voices who start out squeaky clean and get a makeover and become vamps. And it is such a shame.’ Pippa Smith of Safermedia said she was shocked at the 'irrational' decision to expose Blue Ivy to the eyes of strangers on the internet .","Star's fifth album released on iTunes on Friday taking fans by surprise .

GSM, which stands for Global System for Mobile communications, is the world's most widely used cellphone technology — though several large networks, notably Verizon and Sprint, rely on an older network technology called CDMA. The cellphone encryption technology used most widely across the world can be easily defeated by the National Security Agency giving the agency the means to decode most of the billions of calls and texts that travel over public airwaves every day . Watching and listening: The agency’s ability to crack encryption used by the majority of cellphones in the world offers it wide-ranging powers to listen in on private conversations. They're listening: U.S. law prohibits the NSA from collecting the content of conversations between Americans without a court order. If the NSA has the capacity to easily decode encrypted cellphone conversations, then other nations likely can do the same . Calls that have been encrypted according to a common standard called A5/1 — which was developed in 1987. The . vulnerability comes into play on 2G networks, which modern cellphones . may resort to it when 3G or 4G networks are not available or too . congested. More modern networks like 3G and 4G, found throughout the US and other wealthy nations, are more difficult to decode. The Post found that more than 80 percent of cell phones used in the world use outdated and vulnerable technology. David . Wagner, a computer scientist at the University of California Berkley, . said that type of encryption 'was designed 30 years ago, and you . wouldn’t expect a 30-year-old car to have the latest safety mechanisms.' Experts . suggest that while it takes longer for analysts to decode and examine . messages sent on higher systems, it is indeed possible. Some . carriers are already making the change to the newer A5/3 method of . encryption, however, it doesn't matter how strong  strong their . encryption, the calls are automatically decoded upon reaching the . carrier's internal network. The . NSA has repeatedly stated that it only snoops on conversations . involving foreign citizens, as it has no legal basis by which to conduct . such surveillance on Americans. HQ: The NSA has been secretly collecting the phone call records of millions of Americans, using data provided by telecom firms AT&T and Verizon for years . Statement: Snowden had previously insisted that every phone call and internet transaction made in America is logged . Current . US law makes it illegal for the NSA to monitor phone conversations . between American citizens without a court order, yet these documents . reveal that the agency is capable of overriding encryption and listening . in on international citizens. The . Post warned that the intelligence agencies of other nations likely have . the same technology, and may even listen in on American phone calls. This . method of surveillance has made headlines recently because of the . reported NSA tap on world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela . Merkel. 'The . scale of foreign surveillance has become so vast, the amount of . information about Americans 'incidentally' captured may itself be . approaching mass surveillance levels,'' said Elizabeth Goitein of the . Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security Program. 'The . government should be targeting its surveillance at those suspected of . wrongdoing, not assembling massive associational databases that by their . very nature record the movements of a huge number of innocent people,' said Catherine Crump, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties . Union.","Snowden documents and officials reveal agency is able to listen into phone calls even if they are encrypted .

Officers across the country have been issued with the vouchers that allow criminals to collect three days’ supply of provisions donated to food banks. Some shoplifters claim that they had no choice but to turn to crime to feed themselves or their families. Some people believe handing out vouchers to shoplifters will encourage thefts . But critics have said giving vouchers to offenders rewards thieves at the expense of law-abiding citizens. Hundreds of food banks have been set . up by churches and community groups across Britain to give emergency . food parcels to those in need. Doctors and social workers can issue vouchers for food banks to those struggling to pay for food. But the vouchers are also given to . police officers, who are allowing criminals to go free with vouchers . instead of being charged for them. Staffordshire Police have handed out seven vouchers ‘to individuals in need’ since March. In the latest case, an unemployed . shoplifter was cautioned and given a voucher as he was released from a . police station after admitting stealing from a shop in Hartshill, . Stoke-on-Trent. The man, who had spent his benefits . on vet bills for his dog, said: ‘I was given a caution and well and . truly learnt my lesson. As I was leaving, a sergeant beckoned me and . said, “We don’t often give these out, but take this please.” It was a voucher for a food bank which I redeemed the next day. ‘Humanity is alive and well. I apologise for my actions and am thankful we have such kind people working in the force.’ Staffordshire Police said: ‘The arrested man made an honest and frank disclosure. He handed the stolen food back straight away. 'A caution was deemed most . appropriate. The custody sergeant deemed this individual met the strict . criteria for a food bank voucher.’ However, the scheme was suspended in . Staffordshire last night after local Police and Crime Commissioner . Matthew Ellis ordered a review. The scheme set up in March allows shoplifters three days' worth of supplies donated to foodbanks . He said it was ‘absolutely not acceptable that criminals should appear to be rewarded’. Mr Ellis added: ‘It’s not the case in this situation but that’s what it looks like it and that’s something I can’t tolerate.’ Alan Joinson, chairman of East . Bentilee Residents’ Association in Staffordshire, criticised the . decision to give vouchers to offenders. He said: ‘It is ridiculous. It is . encouraging people to shoplift. They will think if they get caught they . will get some free food. It will probably put people off donating. I . wouldn’t want something I had given to go to a criminal.’ In south London, one of the . Metropolitan Police’s safer neighbourhood teams has given out 75 . vouchers for the Norwood and Brixton food bank in six months. Police community support officers in . the West Midlands have issued vouchers to people they suspect to be a . shoplifting risk as a ‘preventative measure’. Food banks provide goods including milk, pasta, soup, tinned vegetables, fruit juice, tea and biscuits. Chris Mould, executive chairman of . the Trussell Trust, which runs more than 370 food banks and helped . almost 350,000 people in 2012-13, said: ‘Food banks will not know . whether someone has been cautioned or caught shoplifting if they are . referred to a food bank with a voucher signed by a police officer. It doesn’t say on it and should not . say on it what the back history is, but it should say that the person’s . need is genuine, that the person is in difficulty and needs emergency . help. ‘That is what food banks are for – to provide emergency food for people when they are in trouble. Because the public donate all the . food, we need to assure them that we’re giving the food to people whose . need is genuine... that is why we operate a voucher system with a whole . range of professionals holding vouchers. ‘If police officers are able to . choose an alternative way of dealing with someone who they believe is . genuinely in trouble and has made a mistake, that actually costs the . country less in the long term than taking them through the courts, but . that is a judgment they make.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Lambeth police have given out 75 vouchers for the Norwood and Brixton food bank in the last six months. The vouchers were issued by response team officers who identified individuals or families in crisis during their day-to-day work. ‘The response has been extremely positive with all vouchers used and people helped who were not previously aware how they could access their local food bank. The vouchers have categorically not been given to shoplifters.’","Scheme was set up in March in Staffordshire and gives shoplifters three days' worth of supplies .

Winston Churchill's powerful speeches have long been credited with helping to win the war, but one leading academic says there is 'little evidence' his oratory inspired the British to beat Nazi Germany. Professor Richard Toye also claims that the Second World War leader's 'finest hour' radio address, one of his most famous, lacked impact 'because many . people thought that he was drunk'. The University of Exeter academic claims in a new book that Churchill was not a decisive influence on the nation's willingness to fight on . against Hitler when Britain was almost on its knees in 1940. His research also found that when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942, one Londoner said his rallying speech was 'f****** bull****' and a 'f****** cover-up'. Scroll down for audio . PM: After the war was won, Winston Churchill addresses a crowd of 20,000 at Walthamstow Stadium, London, but an academic has cast doubt on the effect Winston Churchill's wartime speeches had on the British public in a new book . Churchill's legendary oratory, which included unforgettable phrases like 'we shall fight on . the beaches' and 'never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by . so many to so few', had moved many to join up and fight the Nazis. But Professor Toye denies the traditional view . that Churchill was universally loved and said his speeches had led to . criticism and controversy. 'Churchill's first speeches as prime minister in the dark days of 1940 were by no means universally acclaimed,' he said. 'Many . people thought that he was drunk during his famous ""finest hour"" broadcast and there is little evidence that they made a decisive . difference to the British people's will to fight on.' Well-qualified: Exeter academic Richard Toye, who is an expert on Churchill, looks in detail at how people reacted to his speeches in his book, The Roar of the Lion . Prof Toye's new book - The Roar Of The Lion - examines government documents and surveys, as well as the diaries of ordinary people. He used both the Home intelligence reports and the mass observational archives to analyse what people thought of Churchill's speeches at the time and separate that reaction from what people later remembered or thought they remembered their reactions to be. And he admitted that even he was surprised by the results. He said: 'I thought the established story was completely true I simply thought one had to check it out and find confirmatory evidence for it, I even thought it might be rather dull. 'But when I actually started analysing the records I realised that I wasn't finding the established story that I was expecting. 'I'm not saying Churchill's speeches were bad speeches but people often got depressed by them and that is perfectly understandable because they were often conveying very sobering messages. 'In July and August 1940 we do genuinely find people being excited by his speeches but this feeling then gets projected throughout the whole period and it's actually much more complicated than that. 'I would argue that by the summer of 1940 moral had actually improved on account of the British action in Africa and that bucked everybody up. 'That fact that moral had gone up improved the reception which Churchill's speeches got rather than his speeches improving moral. 'The material I used has all be around but no-one has ever looked at it for these purposes before - to systematically analyse the public response to Churchill's speeches.' One of the most vivid accounts was written by a journalist who had joined the Army and had written down in shorthand the comments of his friend George, a 24-year-old French polisher from south London. Hero: Sir Winston is regarded by many as the man who saved Britain from the clutches of Hitler's Nazi Germany . As George listened to Churchill's speech on the fall of Singapore in February 1942, he reportedly said: 'F****** bulls***. Get on with it. What a f****** cover-up. Any normal person could see it's just pulling the wool over their eyes.' Prof Toye, who works in the Department of History at the University of Exeter, said: 'There was a complexity to people's reactions to Churchill's speeches at the time, as the evidence shows that they may have liked one bit of a speech and not another section, or liked some speeches but not others. 'People sometimes changed their minds following discussions with friends or after reading newspaper commentaries. 'There was not a blanket acceptance and positive reaction. A more measured response to his speeches is in evidence. This is possibly why the speeches didn't always have the effect now credited to them.' Prof Toye said Churchill's famous 'We shall fight them on the beaches' speech of June 1940 was to the House of Commons, and never broadcast, but people convinced themselves they heard it. 'It was never broadcast, though it was reported on the BBC by an announcer and quoted in the press,' he said. 'However, people claim to remember having heard this famous speech from June 1940, even though they hadn't. 'It was recorded for posterity along with others of his wartime speeches nine years later.' Mr Toye has some academic pedigree, after a PhD from Cambridge, his book Lloyd George and Churchill: Rivals for Greatness, won him awards, including The Times Higher Young Academic Author of the Year Award in 2007. Three years later he wrote the book: Churchill's Empire: The World that Made Him and the World He Made. May 13 1940 in his first address as Prime Minister:'I would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined the government: ""I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat."" 'We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? 'I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. 'That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: victory; victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.' June 4 1940 following the evacuation of forces from Dunkirk:'We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air. 'We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing-grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills.We shall never surrender!' June 18 1940 following the collapse of France to Nazi forces:'Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilisation. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. 'The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. 'But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. 'Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, ""This was their Finest Hour.""'August 20 1940 in tribute to the RAF:'The gratitude of every home in our island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the world war by their prowess and by their devotion. 'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.'September 9 1941 on Britain's increasing strength in battle:'The mood of Britain is wisely and rightly averse from every form of shallow or premature exultation. 'This is no time for boasts or glowing prophecies, but there is thisâ€”a year ago our position looked forlorn, and well nigh desperate, to all eyes but our own. Today we may say aloud before an awe-struck world, ""We are still masters of our fate. We still are captain of our souls.""'November 10 1942 following the victory at El Alameinin, North Africa: 'The Germans have received back again that measure of fire and steel which they have so often meted out to others. Now this is not the end. 'It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.'","Professor Richard Toye says his oratory didn't inspire all of Britain to fight .

Japan has a new mascot - in the shape of a newly-formed volcanic island in the likeness of cartoon dog Snoopy. The island, off the country's Pacific coast, rose from the sea over the past few weeks as a massive undersea volcano erupted and spewed out magma which cooled to create the new land mass. By Christmas Eve, the island 620 miles south of Tokyo had expanded and it has now linked with existing Nishinoshima island. New island: In this aerial image, a new islet is seen connected with Nishinoshima island in Ogasawara, Japan . Spot the difference: The island bears an uncanny resemblance to Snoopy . After aerial photographs of the two islands were released, Twitter users pointed out how much they resembled Charlie Brown's faithful companion. The likeness to Charles M. Schulz's creation is realised even further as a pool of reddish seawater, in between the two islands, looks like Snoopy's collar. The Guardian reports experts say the volcano is still active and there is the possibility it will continue to change shape as the magma continues to rise. The long-term future of the island is unclear and there has been specualtion over whether China will claim the island. At the moment, it is part of the Ogasawara chain. Snoopy: Charlie Brown and his dog Snoopy whose likeness has been spotted in the new island . The Canaries could soon be getting a new island too. A series of earthquakes and trembles that have struck in the Atlantic Ocean in the past week suggest that an underwater volcano is about to blow. The largest of these quakes reached a magnitude of 5.1 off the coast of El Hierro - the smallest island in the Canaries - and the island is said to have swelled by three inches. If the volcano was to erupt, the force could push masses of molten rock to the surface and could subsequently create a new island or islet in the Canary chain. It would also mean all 10,000 residents on the 107 square mile stretch of land would need to be evacuated. El Hierro itself was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high.","Island is off Japan's Pacific coast and has been created over weeks .

A mother-of-four has revealed how her children have helped her cope after she lost her own mother in the most horrific of circumstances. Lorna Smith, 45, from Shirley, Croydon, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend Clifford Mills, 49, in 2011. In a premeditated murder plot, he lured her to his flat in Brixton, South London, where he knocked her over the head with a pickaxe handle. He then stabbed her repeatedly and cut her throat, leaving her for dead while he went off to a bar to get drunk using money he stole from her purse. Close: Louise with her mother Lorna who was murdered by her ex boyfriend . Her daughter, Louise Harvey, 24, from Islington, North London, was pregnant with her third child when the crime took place. When she heard her mother had been murdered, she knew exactly who was responsible. 'I was in so much shock. It was like, I know who's done it,' she reveals in the TV show Britain's Darkest Taboos. She added: 'It made it harder, the fact that I knew who had done it. She must have been terrified to know that she had no chance to fight back because he was so much bigger than her.' Lorna had been in a relationship with Mills from 2002 and 2006 after splitting up with Louise's father, Peter. Louise, an only child, had never liked unemployed Mills or the control he exerted over her mother - which increased after he moved in with them. He told her what to wear and watched what she ate, saying he didn't want her to get fat. Louise explained: 'He'd be the one that worked out how long they spent where and where they were going and how much money they would spend here. It was like she had to go by whatever he wanted to do.' Missed: Louise is devastated that Lorna won't see her grandchildren grow up . He had a history of violence as a football hooligan and Louise was alarmed at how he would brag about the fights he had been involved in. For a time, Mills even came between Louise and her mother, as she moved in with her father as she couldn't stand living with him. When Louise is 17, Lorna realised she would be better off without Mills and left him. Louise was delighted. She said: 'I was so happy and I thought finally she can sort her life out again, she can get rid of him and just start afresh.' 'I just think he is pure evil. He knew what he was doing, he'd planned it all, he's just the devil' Lorna did try to move on and started internet dating. But unbeknown to her, Mills was not prepared to leave her alone. He befriended her via a fake Facebook account using the name Charlie Manning. The pair begin to have regular conversations online and he became her confidant. 'Charlie' tells her he is a property developer who wants to treat her like a princess. Lorna, vulnerable after two failed relationships and keen to find love again, believed him. 'She took it all in too much and she believed every single thing that he was saying. He was telling her that he could give her everything that she had ever wanted, someone that could look after her and I think that's what she had always dreamed of,' Louise said. 'I think it just got to her head too much and she became a bit naÃ¯ve and a bit gullible really.' Lorna confides in 'Charlie' about Mills and, with his own motives in mind, he advises her to stay in touch with him saying he must still need her as a friend. Ordeal: The mother-of-four shares her story in a TV documentary . Lorna followed his advice and stayed in contact with Mills, cleaning his flat once a week. However, Louise had suspicions about 'Charlie.' She said: 'Charlie Manning's profile picture was just a white background with a red love heart, he didn't have any other pictures. He had about three friends, not that many. 'When she showed me some of the messages that he'd sent, I was reading through them and I kind of looked at her as if to say, do you really believe this? It seems a bit too good to be real. 'I had turned round to my mum and said, are you sure this isn't Cliff talking to you?' 'I miss my mum like you wouldn't believe. I miss talking on the phone to her every day' Lorna didn't want to believe Charlie could be Mills and carried on chatting to him online. But she was aware their relationship may never go anywhere given they had never met and she didn't even know what he looked like. So when a work colleague asked her out, she said yes. Louise - who by now was engaged with two children and pregnant with a third - said the new relationship made her mother the happiest she had ever seen her. She said: 'Even when she was with my dad I don't think Iâ€™d ever seen her glowing as much as she was and it was such a nice atmosphere. She was free in a way.' Lorna told 'Charlie' about her new relationship and said she wouldn't be able to chat with him online anymore. Murdered by a monster: Louise though her mother was free from Mills but he had been chatting to her on Facebook under a false identity . Unbeknown to her, Charlie was actually her ex Mills. He was furious on hearing she had moved on with a new man and started putting his terrible plan into action. He searched for weapons online and websites on 'how to kill a human being.' A month after hearing of her new relationship, Mills invites Lorna to his flat saying he needs some help with some paperwork. 'Pure evil': Clifford Mills is currently serving his life sentence . Lorna still felt sorry for Mills after leaving him and as a kind-hearted woman who always put others before herself, she made the fatal mistake to visit him. That afternoon, he murdered her in his flat. He turned himself into the police the next day, saying his alter ego 'Stan' made him do it. 'I just think he is pure evil. He knew what he was doing, he'd planned it all, he's just the devil,' Louise said. On February 3rd 2012, a year to the day after police found Lorna's body, a jury at the Old Bailey found Mills guilty of murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve a minimum of 21 years. Louise now has four children, Vinnie, five, Jessica, four, Chiara, two and Luca, 5 months, with her partner Giuseppe. She said it's their love that has helped her move on despite the void Mills has created in their lives. She said: 'I miss my mum like you wouldn't believe. I miss talking on the phone to her every day. I miss the fact that she's not going to see my children grow up and she's never going to meet her youngest two grandchildren. He doesn't realise how many lives he's ruined because he's killed my mum.' She added: 'My kids have helped me get through all of this. If I didn't have them there's no way I could be as strong as I am now.'

Martha Stewart's company fired 100 employees on Thursday - an unwelcome surprise for workers in the run-up to Christmas. The job losses came after Daniel Dienst - previously a scrap-metal recycling executive - took the helm as CEO at the struggling Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia two months ago. Stewart, the company's 72-year-old chairwoman, was spotted last weekend mingling with an A-list crowd at the luxury international art fair Art Basel in Miami. Scroll down for video . Getting in the festive spirit: Martha Stewart, pictured during a promotional event in Miami on December 7, has axed 100 staff from her company . Martha, who holds to the motto 'It's a good thing' and is worth an estimated $300million, had been in Florida promoting the December issue of Martha Stewart Living magazine - the company's last-standing publication. 'Just completed a cooking demo at Macys Aventura mall in Miami. What a great crowd. Delicious brunch recipes from MS Living dec issue,' the entrepreneur tweeted on December 7. The doyenne of home-making was tweeting about her 'Martha' orchid blooming in time for the holidays and a TV appearance about holiday gift-giving on Thursday - the same day that dozens of staff were being ordered to clear their desks. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia had no comment when contacted by MailOnline on Friday. Staff were seen leaving the company's . Manhattan offices, many in tears with belongings stuffed in Martha . Stewart bags after being escorted out of the building immediately by security guards, the New York Post reported. The staffing cuts - about 20 per cent of the workforce - are expected to save the company $10million in the next year. Keeping it sweet: Stewart was in Miami at the weekend promoting her magazine . Stewart also took a pay cut this year - with the company slashing half a million off her salary to bring it down to $3.5million. According to corporate filings for this . year's third quarter, total revenues were $33.8million - down from . $43.5million in the same quarter in 2012. The company was the subject of lawsuit from Macy's over licensing with J.C. Penney - forcing it to end a deal with the latter this year. The knock-on effect was Penney's cut back on advertising in Martha Stewart's magazine and TV shows. Analysts are predicting further losses for the lifestyle company next year.

Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen are facing a slew of federal corruption charges, but as they appeared in court for the first time today, reports emerged that the Republican politician once rejected a plea deal that would have spared his wife entirely. They pleaded not guilty and federal Magistrate David Novak released them without bond on Friday, but ordered them not to leave the country. The McDonnells' lawyer said in court that his clients have already surrendered their passports. Trial was set for July 28. The McDonnells were charged Tuesday with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from the head of Star Scientific, a health supplement company, and then bolstering the company's image through the prestige of Virginia's top political official. Indicted: Former Governor Bob McDonnell and wife Maureen were released without bail after surrendering their passports on Friday . But most of that money flowed to Mrs McDonnell in the form of expensive clothes, and gifts that she later gave her husband. Among the items that the McDonnells may have to return - all listed in a federal government's 14-count indictment - are a silver Rolex engraved watch, two sets of golf clubs, two iPhones, two Oscar de la Renta dresses and Louis Vuitton merchandise including shoes, a purse and a wallet. Mr McDonnell, the first Virginia governor ever to face a criminal indictment, insists that he has done nothing wrong, and his attorney paints a picture of a governor blindsided by his wife's poor judgment. The indictment includes an email she sent to one of the governor's senior staffers, explaining why she accepted one of the Oscar de la Renta gowns from Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams. 'I need to talk to you about Inaugural clothing budget,' she wrote. 'I need answers and Bob is screaming about the thousands I’m charging up in credit card debt.' 'We are broke, have an unconscionable amount in credit card debt already, and this Inaugural is killing us! I need answers and I need help, and I need to get this done.' Gov McDonnell could be preparing a defense the would essentially blame his wife for all of the gifts - which could get both of them off the hook, since she didn't wield official power . The ex-governor has held fast to his insistence that he's innocent. 'I did nothing illegal for Mr Williams in exchange for what I believed was his personal generosity and friendship,' Mr McDonnell said Tuesday in a statement. 'I never promised – and Mr Williams and his company never received – any government benefit of any kind from me or my administration. We did not violate the law, and I will use every available resource and advocate I have for as long as it takes to fight these false allegations, and to prevail against this unjust overreach of the federal government.' He later said in a televised statement that 'I come before you this evening as someone who's been falsely and wrongly accused.' The plea agreement Mr McDonnell rejected last year, according to the Washington Post, would have required him to acknowledge only that he filed an incomplete mortgage application when he failed to list money he had borrowed from Mr Williams. For Mr McDonnell, once considered a possible presidential running mate in 2012, a political future hinges on a complete exoneration. Maureen McDonnell wrote in emails that she was worried about money and affording new clothes in her position as First Lady - which accounted for the designer gifts . So he refused to take the deal, which would have spared him and his family any public hint of corruption charges. But now he and his wife face serious criminal counts that allege a conspiracy to trade his official influence for valuable gifts – and for the loans that kept his house from slipping away. The McDonnells are a rarity in US politics, a political family without wealth. Their attorney is reportedly preparing a legal strategy that will lean on Mrs McDonnell and lay most of the blame for their interactions with Mr Williams at her feet. While that may sound callous, it would likely clear both of any criminal wrongdoing, since a governor's wife doesn't technically have the official power to help generous donors or gift-givers. 'It’s almost like ships passing in the night. Where he says, ""I didn’t know what she was doing."" And she says, ""I had no idea what he was doing,""' former federal prosecutor Jonathan Biran told the Washington Post. 'And the jury is left to decide what’s reasonable. It's an interesting wrinkle.' If it's determined that the governor himself was unaware of the extent to which Mr Williams was opening his wallet to subsidize his wife's expensive tastes, he'll be off the hook – and Republicans will be able to crow that his prosecution was ham-fisted and politically motivated. Democrat Terry McAuliffe won the governorship in November, beating Ken Cuccinelli, McDonnell's state Attorney General. Virginia's top three offices – governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general – are all in Democratic hands at the same time, something that hasn't happened since 1989.","Couple pleaded not guilty to all charges and were released without bond .

A Canadian National Railway train carrying propane and crude oil derailed and caught fire on Tuesday in northwest New Brunswick, Canada, the latest in a string of train accidents that have put the surging crude-by-rail business under heavy scrutiny. No one was injured but about 45 nearby homes were evacuated when the train derailed near the village of Plaster Rock at about 7pm local time, local officials and the railroad said. The train originated in Toronto and was headed to Moncton, New Brunswick, which is about 186 miles east of the site of the accident, said Jim Feeny, director of public and government affairs at CN. Derailment: A train carrying crude oil derailed in New Brunswick, Canada Tuesday night, about 31 miles from the U.S. border. Above, an image of a Canada National Railway train . This latest derailment comes a little more than a week after a train carrying crude oil in the booming oil state of North Dakota derailed and exploded. A series of disastrous derailments has reignited the push for tougher regulation. A surge in U.S. oil production has drastically increased the number of oil trains moving across the continent as pipelines fail to keep up with growing supply. In Tuesday's accident, 15 cars and one unmanned locomotive appeared to have derailed, mostly toward the the rear of the train, including four loads of propane and four loads of crude oil, said Feeny. 'At this point, we cannot confirm that they're involved in the fire. They are in the fire area. Because of the fire, emergency responders can't approach too closely,' he said. The train had a total of 122 cars and four locomotives. Feeny could not say what kind of crude oil the train was carrying and declined to say which customers were involved. Feeney said CN crews have begun arriving and senior executives were also en route. The derailment happened near the Canadian village of Plaster Rock, and about 45 homes in the area needed to be evacuated . Fire officials say the cars appear to have been mostly empty except for some propane residue, said Sharon DeWitt, emergency measures coordinator for Plaster Rock. 'They'll in all probability burn themselves out by morning,' said DeWitt. 'We'll monitor it.' She said there is no danger to residents as the wind is blowing away from Plaster Rock, a village of about 1,000 in a mainly wooded area about 31 miles from the U.S. border and Maine. There have been five major accidents in the past year involving a train carrying crude oil. The most devastating occurred in Quebec in July last year, when a runaway train derailed and exploded in the heart of the town of Lac Megantic, killing 47. Some U.S. politicians have called for a phase-out or retrofit of old tankers that do not meet current safety standards and are prone to puncture.","The derailment happened at around 7pm near the village of Plaster Rock, about 31 miles from the U.S. border .

Polish authorities are now investigating claims the CIA operated a secret prison in used to torture suspected terrorists. News of the investigation comes after a Washington Post report Thursday that detailed the CIA bribe made to Polish intelligence officers and the egregious abuse that took place on the site. The spy agency paid millions to its Polish counterpart during a secret 2003 meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw for the right to use a remote villa for detaining terror suspects, according to the Post. Tortured: 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times at the secret Polish prison, according to the Washington Post . CIA operatives used the clandestine confines to waterboard 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times during interrogations. The former al-Qaida member is now being held in Guantanamo Bay. The ‘black site’ was allowed to open after the CIA handed over two cardboard boxes filled with $15million, according to the Post. It was one of several across Europe. The report spurred prosecutors in the Polish city of Krakow to open an enquiry into the matter. ‘In the course of the investigation that is underway, we will analyze this Washington Post article and will include it in our investigation,’ Krakow sicty spokesperson Piotr Kosmaty told Reuters. The only way criminal charges could be filed is if Polish officials colluded CIA spooks to illegally detain or torture American prisoners, Reuters noted. Poland has long refuted claims of any secret CIA prison within its borders, and the country’s prime minister moved to further distance himself from any responsibility. Detained at the black site: Abu Zubaida (left) and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri (right) were both tortured at the site, CIA operatives reportedly performed a mock execution on al-Nashiri . ‘These allegations that appear in the public sphere are allegations about prisons and torture committed by the CIA, not Poles but Americans,’ said PM Donald Tusk. ‘Irrespective of what prosecutors determine with regard to the responsibility of Poland's civil servants in this case, our role is to guard the interests of the Polish state,’ he added. Hearings were held last month at the European Court of Human Rights regarding whether Poland had ever been complicit in torture, a decision is expected this year, the paper reported. The CIA decided on the remote Polish villa after a ‘remodeled chicken coop’ it had been using in Thailand became overcrowded with Middle Eastern detainees, according to the Post. Though the facility was not big, the American spies agreed to retrofit it with $300,000 in cameras and even converted a backyard shed into a cell. 'It was pretty spartan,’ an agency official told the paper. Once remodeled, a number of prisoners were taken there – including Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Agents performed a mock execution on the man despite him being of little intelligence value, the official said. Waterboarding: CIA operatives reportedly coerced prisoners to talk by putting rags over their faces and dumping water over them to simulate drowning . Spy agency: CIA operatives carried out secret missions and reportedly opened black sites around the world while fighting the 'war on terror' ‘He was an idiot,’ said the former CIA official. ‘He couldn’t read or comprehend a comic book.’ Mohammed was able to outlast the waterboarding because he memorized how long the waterboardings lasted and would just count down the seconds, according to the paper, but he eventually cracked. So did Zubaida, he even offered to help get new detainees to talk, the official said. These results likely are what led then-CIA director of operations Jose Rodriguez to say the techniques produced ‘dramatic positive results.’ Polish authorities will now determine if any laws were broken to achieve them.","The secret prison reportedly opened in 2003 after the CIA paid a $15million bribe to Polish intelligence officials .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:32 EST, 24 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:33 EST, 24 January 2014 . Authorities believe they have finally caught up with Dennis 'Slick' Lilly, a fugitive who slipped out of a Missouri prison while posing as a guard nearly 30 years ago. Police say Lilly was living in Gold Bar under the alias Dave Murray. It also turns out that Lilly likely is dead after they unearthed human remains under his wife's shed. His wife told detectives that Lilly, 64, died from pancreatic cancer in 2012, claiming she buried him in the back yard. Snohomish County detectives last week found human remains under a woodshed behind the woman's Gold Bar home. Long record: Dennis Lilly was serving time for robbery, burglary, car theft and aggravated assault on a police officer when he stole a prison guard's uniform and walked out of Missouri State Penitentiary . The medical examiner has not officially identified the remains and the case remains under investigation, sheriff's spokeswoman Shari Ireton said Wednesday. 'The investigation will continue until the medical examiner has confirmed the identity and cause and manner of death,' she said. 'If it's not who we think it is or if the death is not natural, we'll go from there.' Somewhere between Missouri and Gold Bar, Dennis and Mary Lilly became Dave and Amanda Murray, court papers say. The couple settled into a home at the end of a dead end street in the century-old town of roughly 2,000 people. Amanda Murray bought the property in 1993, according to Snohomish County Assessor's Office records. They became respected business owners, running The Mail Station out of a beige A-frame building just off U.S. 2 on the east outskirts of Monroe. Over the years, Dennis Lilly posed as Santa Claus with children from across the Sky Valley who ventured into the family business each Christmas. He could grow an impressive white beard. 'Heck, his photo is probably in hundreds of homes,' said Mitch Ruth of Ruth Realty, which is next door and leases out The Mail Station building. Quiet life: The couple became respected business owners, running The Mail Station out of a beige A-frame building just off U.S. 2 on the east outskirts of Monroe . Lilly became secure enough in his new persona to call police when he had concerns about crime. In 2010, he reported to the Monroe Police Department that someone sent a child pornography catalog to his business from the Virgin Islands. 'I guess you never know,' said Ruth, who was a corrections sergeant at the Washington State Reformatory before going into real estate. He spent just shy of 15 years working behind the bars of the Monroe prison. Along the way, he monitored and studied thousands of inmates. It's hard for him to imagine that Dave Murray - Lilly - and his wife ever could have run afoul of the law. 'They were always honest and professional working with us. He never presented himself as anything other than a calm, mild-mannered business owner. Neither did she. I have nothing but kind words and memories of both.' A neighbor on the couple's street in Gold Bar said they were always friendly. Each often would stop while on a stroll to make small talk, Amanda Murray often walking her two small dogs. When cancer invaded the man she knew as David Murray, his robust body began to wither away and he needed to use a walker to get down the street. 'He fought his cancer with every ounce of strength and dignity he had,' Ruth said. 'At the end it was just tough. I felt compassion for him.' In his previous life, Lilly was a felon with a long rap sheet. He was serving time for robbery, burglary, car theft and aggravated assault on a police officer. Internet crime sleuths report that he also was a prolific escape artist. A web site for fans of 'America's Most Wanted,' claims that Lilly first escaped prison in 1975 by tunneling out of his cell. He was caught about two weeks later. He reportedly escaped at least two more times in Kansas. Once he stole a prison truck and another time he and some other inmates allegedly overpowered guards in a control tower and scaled the prison walls. He was cornered several hours later and took a shot at a police officer. Lilly was moved to a maximum-security prison in Missouri. 'The Walls': The Missouri State Penitentiary, also known as ""The Walls"", was one of America's most notorious prisons until its closure in 2004. It is now a tourist attraction . He had been on the lam since December 13 1986. That's when he stole a prison guard's uniform and walked out of the Missouri State Penitentiary. Presumably, he met up with Mary Lilly, whom he had married two years earlier. They were pen pals who wed while he was behind bars. Authorities believe that the pair . built new identities using fake names and stolen Social Security . numbers. Records show that Dennis Lilly was using a Social Security . number that was issued to an Arkansas man born in 1881. His wife's . belonged to an Asian man from California who was born in 1928. Court . records detail a maze of false names, birthdates and addresses connected . to the couple. The FBI has been hunting Lilly for years. He's been featured at least twice on 'America's Most Wanted.' A . break came in the case in October when Amanda Murray filed an . application with an online stock trading firm. The application was . denied because her birth date and Social Security number didn't match . the name Amanda Murray. Eight . months earlier, Amanda Murray had applied for a replacement Social . Security card in Washington using the birth date and Social Security . number belonging to Mary Lilly. That same month she officially changed . her name to Amanda Murray, filling out a simple form at Evergreen . District Court in Monroe. A . compliance officer at the brokerage took an interest in the denial and . queried the true name associated with the Social Security number and . birth date Murray provided. That led to her connection with Dennis . Lilly, the fugitive. The . officer contacted an FBI intelligence analyst in Chicago, whose online . research turned up evidence that Amanda Murray is Mary Lilly and that . Dennis Lilly had assumed the name David Murray. The . FBI began digging deeper, using online resources to track the Murrays . to addresses in Monroe and Gold Bar. It appeared, however, that the . couple may have split up in the late 1990s. They had separate addresses . with David Murray showing up in Everett and San Francisco. The . search also uncovered the couple's association with The Mail Station in . Monroe. Amanda Murray has been listed as the owner since 2008. Meanwhile, . there was no official record of David Murray being dead. Unofficially - . on Facebook - he was. A friend had posted a goodbye message and there . were details announcing the date of a wake. Last week an FBI agent visited The Mail Station. Lilly's wife was behind the counter. He confronted her, calling her Mary. She told the federal agent she hadn't been called that name in years. A nearly 30-year secret was unraveling. He asked her where he could find Dennis Lilly. She told him that she thought he was dead. She also said she didn't want to get in trouble. She became upset and explained that she and Lilly had separated about nine years ago and he had moved to California. He returned to Gold Bar around 2009 with the news that he was dying from pancreatic cancer. He said he wanted to be with his family. The couple has an adult daughter. There were records that David Murray was treated for cancer in Seattle. He stayed in a travel trailer on the property, according to neighbors. His wife told the agent that Lilly didn't want law enforcement to know about his death, which could lead to her being held accountable for helping him elude capture. She told authorities that Lilly died sometime in June 2012. She claimed her daughter was there when he died, along with a family friend. 'Later, Amanda dug a hole in the back yard and buried Dennis after the others had departed the house,' court papers said. She told her daughter that Lilly had been cremated and his remains were in a black urn at the house. Agents spoke with the couple's daughter who denied that she was present when her father died. She said that her mother called her, saying that her father had died and his body had been removed by the funeral home. The FBI contacted the Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office, alerting investigators to possible remains outside Gold Bar house. Snohomish County major crimes detectives visited Amanda Murray at her business last week. She admitted again that she buried her husband in the back yard. She declined to say more and asked to speak with a lawyer. When a reporter paid a visit to her business Wednesday morning, she politely but firmly declined to be interviewed. Last week, detectives along with dogs specially trained to find human remains searched the property for several hours. Detectives located the remains beneath a woodpile in a shed. The skeletal remains were turned over to the medical examiner. It could take weeks for a formal identification, most likely using DNA. 'It appears that he was living an under-the-radar kind of life in Gold Bar,' Ireton said. Indeed, said Ruth, the real estate broker. 'He was hiding in plain sight,' he said. The business the couple once ran together is now for sale.","Dennis 'Slick' Lilly escaped from Missouri State Penitentiary in 1986 .

Animal lovers who feel bad about kicking their dogs and cats off the sofa can assuage their guilt with a new range of furniture just for pets. But if they expect to save money on the disproportionately small beds, sofas and chaise-longues they are likely to be disappointed - the items cost up to £1,500 each. Designer Kate May insists the price tag is worth it for pet owners to bestow luxury on their beloved animals with a leather Chesterfield sofa or a fur-lined chaise-longue. Luxury: One of the leather sofa beds made by Kate May, who charges up to £1,500 for her luxury furniture . Pets: Ms May uses her own dogs Stan, Lily and Gypsy as inspiration when she is designing new furniture . Comfort: The chairs are ideal for pet owners who feel guilty about kicking their dogs off the furniture . Since starting her company Pink Whiskers seven years ago, the qualified furniture maker has compiled an international client list. 'I understand cats and dogs because I have got my own,' Ms May said. 'I understand that each breed wants something different from a bed, whether it's a chin rest or a deep base that they can bury themselves in. 'Every animal is different, and they want somewhere comfortable to sleep, just like we do. 'We only use high-quality materials and the best quality fabrics to give every cat or dog a little bit of luxury.' Ms May, 50, started the business after completing a furniture production course at Burnley College, setting up a workshop and showroom in Clitheroe, Lancashire.

A historic Massachusetts town could be reduced to whisper if a strict new noise ordinance is passed. Hingham, which lies just south of Boston, is considering rules that would fine residents who made over 55 decibels of noise during the day and more than 45 decibels at night. Technically you could be fined $100 for your first offense for being louder than a coffee percolator (55 db), a refrigerator (50 db) or even just more than normal conversation (60 db), according to a decibel chart. Be quiet! Loring Hall at the center of historic Hingham, Massachusetts, a town that is considering a very strict noise ordinance . Danger: The proposed law could fine residents for making noise above 55 decibels - normal conversation rates at around 60db . 'It's really a question of giving police some tools to deal with a quality of life issue,' Hingham Board of Selectmen Chairman Bruce Rabuffo told WBZ. Hingham town authorities get around 350 complaints a year, with the most in July. The ordinance, which can seen on the town's website, remains very much a proposal at the moment, but it would also ban construction noise in residential areas between 7pm and 7am. Power tools would not be permitted between 8pm and 7pm. Noise above the limits would be permitted during the day for no more than 15 minutes in an hour. Lawn mowers, snow blowers and tractors are all louder than 55 decibels. Clearing up: Under the rules, snow blowers could only be used for 15 minutes in an hour . Exceptions would be made with certain permits and in emergency situations. But under the new rules residents would be fined $100 for a first offense, $200 for the second and $300 for the third and any thereafter. Hingham Selectmen discussed the proposal on Thursday after putting it out for public discussion and they are now working on the document following comments. Selectman Irma Lauter told the Patriot Ledger: 'I don't think it's ready for prime time yet.' Some residents of the town were concerned about the possible law change. Mike Pungitore, who is in the landscaping business, didn't agree with the idea that loud noises could last no longer than 15 minutes in an hour. Harsh: Under the new rules, town residents would be fined $100 for a first offense, $200 for the second and $300 for the third and any thereafter .

The sister of racing ace David Coulthard died from an overdose of a widely-used prescription drug. At the time of Lynsay Jackson’s death last year, it was thought the 35-year-old had died from a suspected heart attack. But now, following the outcome of toxicology tests, her death certificate has been updated, showing that  the Formula 1 star’s younger sister died from a ‘Propranolol overdose’. Lynsay Jackson (pictured with her brother, David Coulthard, on her wedding day in 2011) died from an overdose of a widely-used prescription drug, it has emerged . The drug - technically known as a beta-blocker - is prescribed for a variety of common health problems, including heart and circulatory conditions, from tremors to high blood pressure, as well as helping to reduce the symptoms of anxiety such as a rapid heart rate or sweating. It is also a treatment for other ailments, from migraine headaches to hyperthyroidism and glaucoma. However the drug has been linked to other deaths - most notably, the American actress Brittany Murphy. Propranolol was found on the bedside table of the Clueless star after she died suddenly in her Los Angeles home in December 2009, after suffering from flu-like symptoms and shortness of breath. Mrs Jackson, whose baby daughter Emilie was just 10 months old at the time, was thought to have suffered cardiac failure at her home in Crossmichael, Kirkcudbrightshire, in the early hours of the morning, after going to bed complaining of stomach pains. She was discovered by her husband, Will, an environmental health officer whom she married in the summer of 2011. Following her death on 9 February last year, police confirmed there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances, and a report was sent to the Procurator Fiscal. An initial entry on the General Registrar for Scotland, in Edinburgh, listed the trained nurse’s cause of death as ‘unascertained, awaiting laboratory results’. But it has now been corrected on official public records to show Mrs Jackson, who had been undergoing a keep-fit regime, including running and a bodyfit bootcamp, succumbed to a fatal dose of Propranolol. Yesterday medical experts said that propranolol was usually a safe drug but that care had to be taken to ensure the correct dose was taken. Former GP Richard Simpson, now Scottish Labour’s public health spokesman, described beta-blockers, and Propranolol in particular, as ‘excellent drugs’, which had made ‘a difference to many people’s lives’. In a moving tribute at her funeral, Mr Coulthard said: 'I will remember her on her wedding day, she looked beautiful, in love with Will' But the MSP added: ‘Like most drugs, you have to take great care and they must be used with caution, according to the prescription. The side effects of Propranolol can include the heart excessively slowing down and the patient feeling weak and tired. People react differently and what is a good dose for one person, might not be right for another. There’s nothing to be frightened about if you are taking these but you do need to make sure the dose is suitable for the individual.’ At the couple’s home, Mrs Jackson’s widower last night declined to discuss the circumstances of his wife’s death. And a spokeswoman for David Coulthard, who has lived for many years in Monaco, said he was currently travelling and unavailable for comment. Speaking after her death, which occurred while her parents, Joyce, 66, and Duncan, 67, from Twynholm, in Kirkcudbrightshire, were on holiday in Australia, the racing driver spoke of the family’s grief, saying: ‘It’s obviously come as a huge shock to us all and we’re still trying to come to terms with it.’ Coulthard himself was told the news about his sister just moments before he was due to appear on the BBC show, Saturday Kitchen Live. He was given the option of dropping out of the show by producers, but instead decided to appear on the 90-minute programme hosted by TV-chef James Martin. He later said: ‘It just seemed like the right thing to do and what Lynsay would have wanted. My parents were in Australia and I discussed their travel plans with my father. We agreed to meet back in Scotland the next day. ‘I’ve since thought a lot about the decision. I do wonder if my sporting career helped me to detach myself from the reality and just get the job done. But the show also helped me to fill those hours. I knew no amount of reflection could bring her back. It felt like there was little I could do to help in Scotland.’ The pair, who also have an elder sibling, Duncan, were known to be extremely close and, until 2005, ‘Super Chick’ – as she was nicknamed by her family -  ran her brother’s fan club, as well as the official David Coulthard motoring museum in Twynholm. In a moving tribute at her funeral, Mr Coulthard, 42, said: ‘I will remember her on her wedding day, she looked beautiful, in love with Will.’ Propranolol has been linked to other deaths - most notably, the American actress Brittany Murphy (pictured) Following her death, friends paid tribute to Mrs Jackson as ‘a wife, a mother and a free-spirit’.Praising his sister’s driving skills, Coulthard, who lives with former Belgian model Karen Minier and their young son, Dayton, once described his sibling as ‘naturally a better driver’ than him when they were growing up, while she jokingly confessed that ‘boys got in the way’ and she ‘lacked his dedication’. In 2001, the driver – who made his Formula One debut in 1994 and won 13 Grand Prix before his retirement from the sport several years ago - honoured her with ‘her dream birthday present’ when he dedicated his first victory of the season in Sao Paulo to her. Just days earlier the then . 24-year-old had moaned about not receiving a birthday present from her . brother but was reduced to tears when she later saw him on television . saying his win in Brazil was in her honour. Speaking . at the time, she said: ‘I phoned David last Tuesday to wish him a happy . 30th birthday and he said he had not managed to get me a present. ‘I was a bit miffed so when he won in Brazil and announced it was dedicated to me it was the best birthday present ever.’ She added: ‘We watched the race on a German channel and they have breaks which seem to last half an hour so we kept having to phone home to Twynholm. When David finished the final lap we were ecstatic.’ After his win, the driver said: ‘It was my sister’s birthday and she asked me for a win, so I dedicate this race to her. This is my 10th win and the best feeling I have had after a victory.’ Propranolol is one of the most widely used drugs in treating heart disease, hailed as a life-saver for millions of patients around the world. But its potentially harmful side effects mean it must be used with caution. It is a beta-blocker which weakens the effects of stress hormones on the heart muscles, airways, arteries, kidneys and other nervous system tissues. Beta-blockers are particularly used for the management of irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure and for preventing patients who have suffered a heart attack from suffering another. But if propranolol is taken in too high a dose, it can slow – and eventually stop – the heart. The drug was implicated in the death in 2009 of US actress Brittany Murphy. The 32-year-old star of the film Clueless died of a heart attack after collapsing in the shower of her Los Angeles home. She was said to have been taking prescription drugs for ‘flu-like’ symptoms. Propranolol was among ten separate drugs found in her bedroom.","Lynsay Jackson, 35, was thought to have died from a heart attack last year .

Hannah Thompson said she was harassed by former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik when she was 17 . The Liberal Democrats were facing fresh embarrassment last night as Lembit Opik was accused of inappropriate behaviour towards a schoolgirl volunteer. Leading Lib Dem activist Hannah Thompson claims she was just 17 when the former MP tried to kiss her at a party meeting. Mr Opik – who is famous for his doomed romances with weather girl Sian Lloyd and one half of pop duo the Cheeky Girls  – is said to have run off with her shoe, then called her Cinderella and asked for a kiss before returning it. Miss Thompson, now 21, also claims he urged her to join him in his bedroom –  and on another occasion invited her to share a mud bath with him. Mr Opik, 48, last night denied the claims, saying: ‘I have no idea why she would say these things’. There is no suggestion of any criminal behaviour on his part. Miss Thompson, who has been pictured with leader Nick Clegg and his former deputy Vince Cable, works for the party in a £20,000-a-year campaigning job and was last year elected vice chairman of Liberal Youth. Despite her dedication to the cause she has joined fellow activists in launching a campaign against a culture of sexism in the party. She even urges other unhappy women to leave. And she has claimed that as well as being ‘harassed’ by Mr Opik she received unwelcome attention from a Welsh Assembly member, about which she says nothing was done. She also says she resigned her post in the party’s youth wing after being described as ‘eye candy’ and discovering her male colleagues were betting on who would sleep with her. The fresh claims heap more embarrassment on the party following two recent scandals. Lord Rennard has been suspended from the party after well-documented claims he pestered young female members and MP Mike Hancock has been accused of badgering a constituent for sex. Both men deny the claims. The complaints of Miss Thompson, the organiser for the Guildford and Woking Liberal Democrats in Surrey, emerged on a Facebook group entitled Rock the Boat – Lib Dems against sexual harassment, which has some 500 members. Last week Miss Thompson wrote on the website about the ‘Cinderella’ incident with ‘a Lib Dem MP’, complaining: ‘I was 17 and my local party treated it like a joke.’ This photograph shows Miss Thompson, who is now 21, with former Lib Dem MP, Mr Opik . She went on: ‘I resigned as vice-chair of Liberal Youth because some of the male members were making bets about sleeping with me.’ Miss Thompson expanded on her claims later, telling the Daily Mail that Mr Opik was the MP who demanded a kiss from her. She said it happened when she was a schoolgirl activist in her then hometown in Wales, and geeky but high-profile Mr Opik – who campaigned against asteroids in Parliament and recently sought to be the party’s London mayoral candidate – came to Aberystwyth in 2010 for the General Election campaign. Even before he arrived, she said, local activists agreed that if he had to be put up in a member’s home it could not be a woman’s, because of his reputation. Miss Thompson said that after a day’s campaigning they adjourned to a student bar, continuing: ‘My shoe fell off and Lembit grabbed it and ran off with it round the corner. When I got to him he called me “Cinderella” and said I could not have my shoe back until I kissed him. In the end he didn’t actually kiss me – but he definitely tried.’ She said that others in the local party had dismissed Mr Opik’s behaviour as trivial, saying: ‘People just labelled it banter.’ Miss Thompson claims that at one point one of them even said to him: ‘Lembit – what have we told you? You mustn’t sleep with anyone.’ Miss Thompson, pictured with former deputy leader of the Lib Dems Vince Cable (both centre), works for the party in a £20,000-a-year campaigning job and was last year elected vice chairman of Liberal Youth . She said she bumped into Mr Opik on several other occasions, with the pair being pictured together in March 2010. One time, she said, he urged her to join him in his bedroom, and made lewd suggestions. Miss Thompson added: ‘Lembit said; “Do you want to come up to see my stuffed animal of mythic proportions?”’  Another time, she claimed, he invited her and another schoolgirl to his room, saying ‘I want you to come and have a mudbath’.  Mr Opik denied all the allegations. Miss Thompson complained last year that Welsh Assembly member William Powell, 50, plied her and two other young girls with absinthe in 2011, touched her leg and put his hands around their waists. But she said that despite belatedly complaining through an MP’s assistant she never received a response. The Daily Mail has been told by a party source that Mr Powell was ‘given a formal written warning’.","Leading Lib Dem activist Hannah Thompson claims she was just 17 when the former MP tried to kiss her at a party meeting .

Labour was facing a damaging split last night after allies of  Tony Blair accused Ed Miliband of taking the party back to the 1970s when it vowed to ‘tax the rich until the pips squeak’. The backlash came after Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said that a future Labour Government would raise the top rate of income tax from 45p in the pound to 50p for those earning over £150,000, reversing a cut made by David Cameron. Mr Balls claimed the increase was vital to reduce the budget deficit ‘more fairly’. Labour MPs and union leaders hailed the initiative as a ‘populist vote-winner’ that could propel the party into power at next year’s General Election. But the tax hike was attacked by powerful figures close to Mr Blair, who claimed it was a ‘lurch to the Left’ reminiscent of Harold Wilson’s Government, when the top rate of tax rose to 83p – and 98p when unearned income was added. One of Mr Blair’s key supporters said: ‘This takes Labour back to the 1970s. It’s goodbye to the enterprise economy with knobs on. 'It is a return to the outmoded idea that you are for or against the poor. The whole point of New Labour was it showed you could help the poor and wealth creators at the same time. ‘Miliband and Balls are turning their backs on that. Miliband thinks he is redesigning capitalism with the same fervour that Margaret Thatcher did, and talks grandly of helping the low-paid by the “predistribution” of wealth instead of redistribution. ‘The trouble is they are economically illiterate and have no understanding of business or profits.’ Former Labour City Minister Lord Myners said: ‘We need to encourage productive enterprise and effort rather than resort to predatory taxation. It’s not clear how this is going to help the UK economy compete with the world’s growth economies. 'The UK already has an income tax system that is more progressive than most of our international competitors.’ His comments were echoed by business leaders, including Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors, who urged Labour to ‘drop its practice of knee-jerk reversion to the old Socialist nostrums that so damaged Britain’s economy in the past’. Why is Ed Balls announcing this plan now? Labour argues that, with 15 months to go until the 2015 Election, it is time to set out its core economic policies. The Conservatives say that  Mr Balls has been thrown into crisis by the success of George Osborne’s deficit-cutting, and needs to rescue his career with  an eye-catching policy.What proportion of total tax revenue comes from the highest earners? The top one per cent – those earning more than £160,000 – accounted for 30 per cent of all income tax last year.Are top earners contributing more than  they used to? The proportion of income tax paid by the top one per cent has risen from a fifth to a third in a decade.Will the 50p rate raise extra money? Balls claims that between 2010 and 2013, when the 50p top-rate applied, the tax take from £150,000-plus earners rose by more than £3 billion a year. Osborne says the additional revenue from 50p was just £500 million a year – with the rest coming from crackdowns on tax-dodging and a surge in the economy. The Office  for Budget Responsibility says the lost tax revenue from cutting the rate from 50p to 45p last year was just  £100 million. How does the UK compare with other countries? France has the top rate – those earning more than €1million pay 75 per cent. The UK’s 45p rate is the 11th highest in Europe – but it’s still above the US top rate of 39.6 per cent and the EU average of 37.9 per cent. How many people will pay the top rate? In 2011, 236,000 paid tax at the 50p rate, out of  31 million taxpayers in the UK. And Sir Stuart Rose, the former Marks & Spencer chairman and current head of Ocado, added: ‘This is a very bad idea – it will put in jeopardy all the good work that has been done to put the economy back on track. ‘It will send out worrying messages to the wrong people, and will risk confidence and investment. My biggest single worry is why, when we have come all this way, would you want to risk that with a move like this? ‘Interest rates remain low and the Government says they will continue to do so; confidence is returning, people are coming back to work. The signs are the economy is improving. ‘This move is tokenistic. It’s a small amount of money coming from an income bracket that contributes heavily to income tax with a potentially damaging effect on confidence.’ Mr Balls’s speech yesterday came after accusations that he miscalculated by claiming the Tories’ ‘austerity Britain’ package of savage spending cuts would make the recession worse. Instead, there is growing evidence that the economy is on the mend. Mr Balls said the last Labour Government’s decision to lift the top rate to 50p resulted in those earning over £150,000 paying an extra £10 billion in tax over three years. But the Tories pointed out that the Treasury disputes this, claiming it raises less than £1 billion a year and has a damaging effect on job creation. Mr Balls said Labour also wanted a lower 10p starting rate of tax for those on middle and lower incomes. ‘When the deficit is still high and for ordinary families, real incomes are falling and taxes have risen, it cannot be right for Cameron and [George] Osborne to give the richest people in the country a huge tax cut,’ he said. ‘That’s why the next Labour Government will reverse the top-rate tax cut. ‘We will create a fairer tax system, crack down on tax avoidance and reverse the cut for hedge funds. Those with the broadest shoulders should bear a fairer share of the burden.’ Labour has already indicated it plans to impose a ‘mansion tax’ on homes worth over £2 million. His speech to the Labour-supporting Fabian Society follows a series of rows with Mr Miliband and other colleagues. Last November, The Mail on Sunday revealed how an email from Mr Miliband’s office described Mr Balls as a ‘nightmare’. And earlier this month we disclosed how Mr Balls had to be ‘dragged apart’ from Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander. Furthermore, Tory MPs have taunted Mr Balls for abandoning his ‘flatlining’ gesture – in which he waved the palm of his hand horizontally at Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne in Commons clashes – representing the ‘flatlining’ economy. The recent rise in growth figures has forced him to keep his hands by his side. On the face of it, Ed Balls’s plan to raise the top-rate of tax to 50p is a vote-winner. It is supported by  six out of ten adults overall, with fewer than one in five against. Even Tory supporters favour it by  a small margin. But the problem for Mr Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband is that voters do not trust them – or their motives. That is the deeper picture that emerges from a Survation poll  for The Mail on Sunday carried out immediately after Mr Balls’s dramatic announcement yesterday. Nearly half of voters say the 50p plan stems from Labour’s desire to target the rich for its own sake, with just 32 per cent siding with Mr Balls’s claim that it is a vital source of extra revenue for the public purse. And if Mr Balls thought his pledge  to balance the books by 2020 would convince people the economy is safe in his hands, he has more reassuring to do – 57 per cent say he will not achieve it, with 22 per cent won over. Voters are evenly divided on claims made by some business leaders that the tax hike for the well-off will force entrepreneurs to flee Britain, as a wealth tax has done in France. A total of 38 per cent say this will happen against 40 per cent who say it won’t. Regardless of its populist appeal,  Mr Balls’s 50p tax plan has not seen his ratings overtake those of George Osborne. A total of 28 per cent trust Mr Balls to run the economy, with  Mr Osborne on 34. Survation pollster Damian Lyons-Lowe said: ‘The 50p income tax proposal is clearly popular in itself – even a fair number of Conservative voters approve of it. But the problem for Mr Balls is he lacks credibility.’","Blair allies accuse the Shadow Chancellor of 'economic illiteracy'

Rumours: Sam Gardiner posed as a freelance journalist called Samuel Rhodes, whom he illustrated with a stock photograph . A schoolboy has revealed how he fooled the world with football transfer rumours he invented, while posing as an established journalist on Twitter. Sam Gardiner, 17, set up an account using a stock photograph and the name Samuel Rhodes. He claimed to be a freelance writer for the Daily Telegraph and Financial Times, while posting football rumours designed to raise his profile among 'gullible' fans. His Twitter account was suspended last month after his ploy was uncovered by genuine journalists, but thanks to lucky guesses which seemed to confirm his insider status, he was able to rack up 25,000 followers on the site. Sam's plan initially involved pretending to be former football scout Dominic Jones, a reporter a Goal magazine, but was closed down after complaints from the title. He then switched to the Samuel Rhodes persona, and would pretend to be covering international matches on the ground, and would 'confirm' existing rumours. The told the Financial Times that he targeted fans of troubled clubs with his bogus revelations 'because they'd be the most vulnerable'. Sam said: 'At first I didn’t know what I was doing – a couple of rumours, stats... I’d take a picture of the Bernabéu [where Real Madrid play] and say ""reporting live"".' In late 2012 he claimed to know that Chelsea were set to sack their manager Roberto Di Matteo, and put the 'news' online one day before the club confirmed it. The fluke gave him 'a lot of credibility', and allowed him to get in touch with players from major teams via Twitter and actually discuss transfer rumours. Facade: Sam Gardiner, 16, used a fake Twitter profile to spread football rumours . A rumour he started about Mohamed Salah confirming a £9million transfer to Liverpool FC went viral in Egypt and was picked up by major news outlets despite being 'made up in my living room'. Sam has said that he never intended to make profit from the rumour-spreading, but just to get a bigger platform for his views, particularly about Arsenal. He says he feels 'a tiny bit' of guilt, but now wants to pursue journalism as a career in earnest.","Sam Gardiner, 17, posed as a football journalist and spread bogus rumours .

The rich of San Francisco have found a new way to flaunt their wealth – buying artisanal toast. Bakeries and cafes in the city have been cashing in on the wealth of the resident Silicon Valley high flyers by selling gourmet toast made with ‘Josey Baker sourdough’, featuring toppings such as ‘smallbatch almond butter’ and ‘sour strawberry jam’. One San Franciscan blogger for Venturebeat.com complained that he paid a whopping $4 (£2.40) for a single slice of toast coated with the preserve at a café called The Mill, which also offers the nutty butter option. Cashing in: Cafes in San Francisco are increasingly selling artisanal toast as the city's high flyers turn to bread to flaunt their wealth . Waste: One blogger has complained that consumers in San Francisco (pictured) are overspending on the 'simple facets of life' Toasting was originally used to preserve bread, with the trend for eating it spread throughout Europe by the Romans - and to America by the British. It was made by holding bread over a fire or laying it on hot stones. The first electric toasters arrived in the early 1900s with the first pop-up toaster popping up in 1926. The word toast comes from the Latin tostum, which means 'something scorched'. He said: ‘It was an experiment in upper-middle class lifestyle consumerism. In San Francisco, flaunting your wealth has been elevated to new lows, if you will. We overspend on the simplest facets of life.’ A writer for the Pacific Standard believes the gourmet toast fad in San Francisco can be traced back to a coffee shop called Trouble. From there it spread across the city – but it’s reached Britain’s shores, too. Food writer and self-confessed ‘toast junkie’ Tonia George, for example, sells artisan toast at her Ginger & White cafes in London. Menu highlights include flour station sourdough toast - £3.50 for two slices - and Somerset salted butter, according to The Guardian. Bakery chain Gail’s offers toast made from 30 varieties of bread, costing £2.50 for two slices – and E5 Bakehouse in Hackney charges £1 for a slice of sourdough toast. Le Pain Quotidien is a major player in the artisanal toast game, too, as The Times reports.

It charges £2.95 for two slices of toast, with a whole variety of bread on offer, including rye, walnut or sourdough. Further evidence of toast’s elevated status in Britain came last year when the Federation of Bakers produced Eau de Toast perfume for London Fashion Week. It boasted ‘yeast top notes with a hint of caramel combined with complementary bitter-sweet and malty base notes to help give the overall impression of freshly toasted bread’.","One cafe called The Mill sells toast covered in 'smallbatch almond butter'

Moors Murderer Ian Brady is still a danger to the public despite his age, according to a report by mental health experts . A report released as part of the child killer's failed bid to be sent to a mainstream prison yesterday described him as 'an untreated violent and sexual offender' who is suffering from a 'chronic psychotic illness'. The 76-year-old was told last year his appeal to be sent to a prison to serve his sentence was to be refused for his own health and safety, but yesterday Judge Robert Atherton gave the reasons for the decision in a detailed ruling running to more than 100 pages. Behind bars: Ian Brady (left), 76, was jailed for life in 1966 along with his now-dead girlfriend Myra Hindley (right) Appeal: Ian Brady at a mental health tribunal last year when he was seen in public for the first time since the 1980s. He was appealing for the right to be released . Brady, who murdered five children in the 1960s with his lover Myra Hindley, was jailed for life in 1966. He will remain a patient at maximum-security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside. Leading clinical psychologist Professor Peter Kinderman, from Liverpool University, told the Mail that killers 'don't simply stop being a threat at 76 years old. 'Many people would quibble that is particularly old. They can do still things that can be extremely dangerous.' He added that the report appears to indicate Brady has a volatile nature. He said: 'He has a difficult and confrontational relationship with staff.' The ruling quoted from his medical history, citing case notes prior to his sentence in 1966 by Dr Lindsay Neustatter, senior physician in psychological medicine, describing Brady as 'a ruthless individual, cold and unemotional, without conscience or remorse... he showed a pathological admiration of power and unscrupulousness'. Another medical officer later wrote that he is a 'schizoid psychopath of utter untruthfulness who has the rather unusual ability in this type of personality of dissociating himself from the crimes of which he has been convicted... increasingly I feel that it is a symptom of the terrifying intensity of his psychopathy, and that he is not defending against recalling his offences but that, as far as he is concerned, they fail to rise above his mental horizon.' The tribunal accepted Brady is suffering from 'chronic psychotic illness' but there were 'differences in eminent medical opinion' demonstrating the complexity of his condition. Victim: Keith Bennett (left), 12, who was murdered by Ian Brady, and his . mother Winnie, who spent her life calling for the killer to reveal what . he did with her son's body . At the end of the hearing, the panel said Brady should remain in Ashworth on the grounds that he is insane and hospital staff are best placed to treat his psychosis. Hospital records showed that Brady has . hallucinations, continues to talk to himself while alone, has been . violent and abusive to other patients and staff, and leads a largely . 'nocturnal' existence - only leaving his room at night and shunning . other patients and staff he regards as beneath him. In one incident he called another patient a fat f****** slug, you fat b******, sat there'. The report added: 'The patient asked what Mr Brady was talking about, who responded by putting his pen between his knuckles making a fist around it and said: ""Do you want to do something about it?"" 'It was done in a threatening manner. At that stage members of staff intervened and Mr Brady was asked to go to his room. As he was ushered through the ward he stopped to be abusive. The staff tried to calm him. 'He claimed that a patient had been throwing cereal around and smearing honey on chairs to annoy him.' Brady was also noted as 'baring his teeth and spitting'. Judge Atherton said in his full ruling: 'The tribunal concluded that it has been demonstrated by this evidence that it is necessary in the interests of his own health and safety that he be detained in hospital for treatment and that appropriate treatment is available. 'The tribunal considered that it would be inappropriate to make any recommendation because, in its judgment, it is not appropriate to recommend his discharge.' The 116-page ruling says Brady's wishes must be taken into consideration. 'His views are important because he will spend the rest of his life either in a hospital or in prison. 'There is no possibility of him being discharged into the community. 'However, the determination of that issue depends substantially upon his mental condition, about which there is an array of opinions amongst the medical practitioners who gave evidence to the tribunal.' Investigation: Police and volunteers search . Saddleworth Moor in October 1965 for the bodies of the children killed . by Brady and Hindley . The tribunal said 'with the benefit of hindsight' Brady should have been transferred to hospital for treatment before he had served 19 years in various prisons. The ruling adds: 'One must also remember that he is now a 75-year-old man. When he was in prison he was much younger. He is now physically much weaker. 'But his notoriety has not diminished. The inmates of a prison would not be selected as the other patients on the ward are. 'That would create a significant risk to his safety even though the prison officers are acknowledged to have the skills to deal with such issues.' Brady has the right to challenge the decision, which would require a further hearing at an Upper Tribunal. There was no immediate response from his legal team to the findings. Brady told the tribunal hearing he was merely a 'a petty criminal' and described his crimes as 'recreational killings' which were part of an 'existential experience'. Ian Brady on his way to court in 1966. He was described as suffering from 'chronic psychotic illness' Brady's legal team argued that, despite his severe personality disorder, he is not mentally ill and therefore no longer fulfils the legal criteria for detention in hospital. Brady has suggested that, if he is allowed to go back to a jail, he would be 'free to end his own life' by starving himself to death. Last year's tribunal heard that Brady, who claims to have been on a hunger strike since 1999 and is fed through a tube in his nose, in fact eats toast and soup and this is simply a 'protest' rather than suicidal. It was suggested that Brady's legal bid showed his pathological need for control and to challenge authority and a craving for the public spotlight. Hindley died in jail in November 2002, aged 60. The child-killer's Â£250,000 taxpayer-funded legal bid to be transferred to a jail was the first time he had been seen in public for decades and was criticised by victims' families as a 'circus' and a 'complete waste of taxpayers' money'. Yesterday pictures of a man believed to be Brady covered in a sheet arriving at hospital were released.

But, in the latest challenge to the Prime Minister’s authority, 100 MPs say the Government’s proposals do not go far enough. They are backing a rebel amendment, tabled by Tory Dominic Raab, that would make it all but impossible for foreign criminals to exercise their Article 8 right to a ‘family life’. Ministers have been resisting the amendment, which they claim is so strict that it could flout the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights. It could lead to a humiliating split in the Commons. Backbenchers already want to use the Immigration Bill to reinstate controls on workers from Romania and Bulgaria, leaving No10 fighting fires on two fronts. There are currently about 4,000 overseas convicts living in the UK that the Government wants to remove but is blocked from doing so by human rights laws. Two years ago, Home Secretary Theresa May issued new instructions to the courts to say that overseas convicts should normally be deported regardless of their family circumstances. But immigration judges defied her on the grounds that the guidance was not primary legislation so did not carry the same weight as the Human Rights Act. Mrs May is now seeking to change the law to state that Article 8 should no longer normally be a bar to deportation. But Tory MPs say her proposals still leave too much discretion in the hands of the courts, which could block deportation if the criminal can prove a ‘genuine and subsisting’ relationship with a partner or child. The backbench amendment removes the discretionary element, so courts would have to order deportation of a foreign criminal jailed for a year or more, unless he faced torture or death on removal. The only exception would be if the Home Secretary thinks halting a deportation ‘is in the overwhelming humanitarian interests of the offender’s children’. Mr Raab said the courts need to be told to deport in unequivocal language. ‘This amendment will cut the spurious human rights challenges lodged by convicted killers, rapists and drug dealers to evade deportation, and restore some common sense to our border controls,’ he said. ‘Having talked about reform for the last three years, it’s time we delivered – that’s what this amendment will do.’ Two years ago, Home Secretary Theresa May issued new instructions to the courts to say that overseas convicts should normally be deported regardless of their family circumstances . The amendment is a massive new headache for No10. Up to 70 Tory backbenchers are already planning to use the legislation to call for the re-instatement of controls on migrants from Bulgaria and Romania, which the Government says would flout EU law. The Immigration Bill has already been withdrawn once to avoid a confrontation with rebels. But Mr Cameron has been warned that unless the Bill returns next week, it would run out of time to get through the House of Lords in this parliamentary session and could be lost altogether. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Those who abuse our hospitality by committing serious crimes have no place in Britain and we are determined to see more of them kicked out. ‘We are passing legislation to ensure judges don’t regard the right to a family life as an absolute and unqualified one.’ Mustafa Abdullahi, 31, was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his 'vulnerable' victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home . A Somali rapist, who held a knife to a pregnant woman’s throat as he assaulted her, is among the many criminals who cannot be deported from Britain because of rules on a right to family life. Mustafa Abdullahi, 31, was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his ‘vulnerable’ victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home. He was set to be deported on release and Home Office lawyers warned immigration judges of his dangerous nature and a continued lack of respect for the law. But in December last year he was deemed to have a right to a family life under Article 8 and released. Abdullahi does not have any children or a wife in Britain, but his mother and siblings live here. The judges gave him credit for having put his criminal behaviour ‘behind him’. They also concluded he posed a ‘low risk’ of offending again, based on evidence from a psychiatrist who saw him for only a couple of hours.","David Cameron is facing a major backbench revolt over right to 'family life'

A scientist has been given a €1million grant by the government to build the country's first plant for converting sewage in to energy. Dr Dominik Peus has developed a process called Hydrothermal Carbonisation (HTC) which converts sewage, agricultural waste, food waste and slurry into carbon and water. The end product, dubbed biocoal, does not contain sulphur. It therefore burns more cleanly and qualifies . for renewable energy subsidies. Now the doctor's company Antaco has been awarded a grant of €1million by the Department of Energy and Climate Change . to build the country's first biowaste conversion plant. A doctor has invented a way to convert sewage into coal - which can be used in existing power plants . A statement on the company's wesbite said: 'Over the past 5 years Antaco has developed a process that turns biowaste into a high value biofuel – biocoal. Antaco’s technology is unique with its ability to convert 100 per cent of organic matter into a high heat value biofuel – biocoal. 'In so doing, solves two major issues a) diverting waste from landfill and b) providing a carbon neutral fuel. The grant will enable Antaco to progress to the next stage of building and commissioning its first prototype plant which will be producing approximately 500 tonnes of biocoal by March 2014.' Dr Peus added: 'It’s mad that we pay people to take away . our waste, when it’s actually a valuable commodity. It’s . like flushing coal down the toilet, or paying the bin men to take away . our money.' HTC involves cooking biomass at 200C and at an atmospheric pressure of 20bar. It is essentially the same process that . creates coal - except it takes hours rather than thousands of years. A sample of the biocoal. It is created by cooking biowaste under pressure . Biocoal slurry can be dried into . pellets and used as a direct replacement for fossil coal in existing power . generating facilities, as well as in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and . household boilers. Use of the HTC method could cut the . operating costs of any sewage plant by half, slash its energy use by 73 . per cent and reduce carbon emissions by 95 per cent, according to a . study by the University of Zurich. By using the HTC process related emissions could cut be reduced to a twentieth of their current level, says the study. According to a recent . lifecycle assessment by LCAworks in conjunction with Imperial College . London, HTC is four times more efficient at dealing with sludge than . anaerobic digestion. Today’s . stringent European and national directives mean that sewage sludge . cannot be spread on farmland and is an expensive overhead. Dr Peus . displayed a sample product of biocoal made from orange peel discarded . from a fruit processing plan at . the Cleantech UK Trade and Investment event in London on Friday, . 'They . say it’ll cost €750m to refurbish one of Europe’s power stations.

British patients should adopt more 'pushy' American attitudes with their doctors to get drugs they are entitled to, the head of the NHS rationing body has said. Professor David Haslam, chairman of the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice), said that patients need to see themselves as 'equal partners' with doctors to get the treatment they need. And he explained that after working as a doctor near an American air force base in Cambridgeshire, he noticed that U.S. patients had a less deferential approach than local residents. Waiting room: Patients are being urged to push their GPs for drugs they are entitled to after it emerged there is a 'disastrous postcode lottery' of care in the NHS . 'Americans tended to want to know more about their treatment than the British who tend to be much more ""thank you doctor, I will take that"",' he told the Daily Telegraph. Earlier this week a Government report found that a third of patients with kidney cancer and one in three motor neurone disease sufferers are not receiving the drugs they need. Health experts warned that the research by the Health and Social Care Information Centre had exposed an 'endemic and disastrous postcode lottery' of care within the health service. Prof Haslam said an investigation was under way to uncover why so many patients are not being prescribed medications. But he explained that patients should demand the drugs they need and only be refused Nice-approved drugs if they are unsuitable. Patients are also being urged to take more interest in the drugs they are taking or could be prescribed . He said that, although he was not suggesting that patients should be confrontational, he wanted them to tell doctors if they think they are missing out on treatments which could help them. He said: 'When products have been approved for use by the NHS by Nice, patients have a legal right to those drugs - as long as they are clinically appropriate. The take-up should be much higher than it currently is.' The former GP also urged people to have a better understanding of the drugs they are taking or might be able to take, allowing them to work better with their doctor. He added that it was 'essential for the future of the health service and the future health of the nation' for patients to understand their conditions and treatments.","NICE chairman Professor David Haslam has urged patients to push their GPs for drugs they are entitled under NHS guidelines .

A soon-to-be-released book about a notorious mafia robbery claims that mob turncoat Henry Hill - who inspired the classic Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas - stole more than $1 million from cosmetics queen Estee Lauder. But, the book claims, Hill managed to charm the millionaire into giving him her phone number and taking her out for drinks as his henchmen ransacked her townhouse. The book, with the tentative title . The Lufthansa Heist, details the 1978 armed robbery at JFK airport that . was masterminded by Hill and wiseguy Jimmy 'The Gent' Burke. The robbery . also plays a major role in Scorsese's Goodfellas. Charmed: Cosmetics queen Estee Lauder was so charmed by mobster Henry Hill that she went for drinks with him as his friends robbed her home . Goodfella: Henry Hill inspired the character played by Ray Liotta in the film Goodfellas . According . to author Daniel Simone, Hill - who died in 2012 - told him that in the middle of robbing . Lauder's townhouse, he noticed that she was terrified. 'Henry and his men bound and gagged Estee . and her staff and were ransacking her house,' Simone tells Page Six. 'Estee was terrified and . was convulsing, so Henry felt bad and proposed to take her out for a cup . of coffee, saying he’d bring her back when his men had finished. Lauder, however, apparently was interested in coffee/ . 'But . they went to PJ Clarke’s and had a couple of cocktails,' Simone continues. 'Estee began to . warm to him and even gave him her personal phone number. As a final . request, he asked her not to call the police until half an hour after . they left, which she did.' The Lufthansa Heist - as the robbery at JFK airport has come to be known - made headlines this week when federal authorities arrested alleged mobster Vincent Asaro for his supposed role in the 35-year-old robbery. Additionally, his son Jerome and three others also were arrested for their alleged ties to organized crime. Rat: Hill, who died in 2012, betrayed his mafia pals and became a cooperating witness in exchange for a plea deal . Federal prosecutors claim that Asaro served as a lookout during the robbery. Simone, however, interviewed for his book Edward McDonald, the former US attorney who led the investigation into the Lufthansa Heist, and doesn't believe that Asaro had anything to do with the robbery. 'Based on all my research, Asaro was not . involved. Hill was not aware that there was anyone left alive that was . involved with the heist,' Simone says. 'The only possibility is that Asaro might have . had a crime stake at the airport and may have demanded a tribute [a cut . of the deal] from Jimmy Burke.' During a brief hearing at a Brooklyn court on Thursday, Asaro, the alleged leader of the Bonanno organized crime family, pleaded not guilty to robbery charges. After the hearing, his attorney Gerald McMahon said: 'I got a call from Martin Scorsese. He wants to do a sequel to Goodfellas and it seems that federal prosecutors are providing him with the script.' Defense: Vincent Asaro's attorney, Gerald McMahon, says his client will fight the charges . Arrest: Vincent Vinny Asaro, second from right, has been charged over the the infamous Lufthansa heist of 1978 . Asaro, 78, was charged with the theft of $5 . million in cash and $1 million in jewelry from the Lufthansa Terminal at . JFK airport on December 11, 1978. At . the time, it was the biggest cash heist ever in the U.S. The . stolen $5 million would be worth $17.9 million in 2013 dollars, . according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 'Vincent Asaro devoted his adult life to the Bonanno crime family, with a criminal career that spanned decades,' U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. 'Neither age nor time dimmed Asaro's ruthless ways, as he continued to order violence to carry out mob business in recent months.' Asaro - who the Daily News describes as having a 'front-row seat to decades of mob history - also allegedly was involved in another iconic scene from Goodfellas. In the movie, a mobster named Tommy DeVito - played by Joe Pesci - is playing cards at a mafia hangout and shoots a kid named 'Spider' in the foot for taking too long to bring him a drink. In reality, the mobster who shot 'Spider' was Tommy DeSimone - and it was supposedly Asaro who took the teen to get stitches. The attorney for Asaro, who has been held without bail, said he would fight the charges. Mr McMahon added that his client had been framed by shady turncoat gangsters, including former Bonanno boss Joseph Massino - the highest-ranking member of the city's five organized crime families to break the mob's vow of silence. Iconic: The multi-million dollar heist was made famous in the 1990 film Goodfellas . Massino 'is one of the worst witnesses I've ever seen,' Mr McMahon said. He added that Asaro had given him orders that 'there will be no plea and he will walk out the door a free man'. The gangsters involved in the infamous heist had . each been promised a $750,000 payment that most didn't get 'either . because they were killed first or it was never given to them,' according . to court papers filed in the Brooklyn court on Thursday. 'These ""goodfellas"" thought they had a license to steal, a license to kill, and a license to do whatever they wanted,' George Venizelos, FBI assistant director-in-charge, said. Asaro resented the non-payment, according to a 2011 recording made by a cooperating witness. 'We never got our right money, what we were supposed to get, we got f***ed all around,'  Asaro allegedly told the witness, according to the papers. 'That f***ng Jimmy [Burke] kept everything.' Burke, the suspected mastermind of the . heist, died in prison in 1996 while serving time for the murder of a . drug dealer. Actor Robert De Niro played a character based on Burke in . the film. 'A lot of the main characters, like Burke, either died, disappeared or were murdered,' said Anthony DeStefano, a veteran New York crime reporter and author of the 2013 book Vinny Gorgeous: The Ugly Rise and Fall of a New York Mobster. Charges: Vincent Asaro, an alleged captain in the Bonanno crime family, has denied allegations that he was involved in the robbert . A break in the case came after an FBI investigation of a New York property tied to Burke last summer turned up human remains. The Thursday indictment charges Asaro with the murder of Paul Katz in 1969, as well as robbery, conspiracy and other crimes tied to the 1978 heist. Asaro and Burke allegedly strangled Katz with a dog chain because they thought he was cooperating with investigators, prosecutors said. His body was first buried in the basement of a vacant house in the New York borough of Queens and later moved to the location where it was found last summer, they said. The papers also charge the men were involved in a 1981 arson at a building where a businessman had intended to open a nightclub catering to black people in the then mostly white neighborhood in Queens, where the accused gangsters socialized. The papers also mention a discussion between Asaro and the other indicted men about more recent crimes, including extortion, loan sharking and violence, as recently as 2013. Hearing: Thomas  DiFiore is one of five suspected mafia members arrested this week. He face extortion charges that are not related to the heist . Cuffed: Two of five men arrested by the FBI are pictured leaving a Brooklyn court . Asaro was charged with four criminal . counts, including robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery, in . connection with the Lufthansa heist. He is also charged racketeering and extortion for other alleged criminal activity. Vincent . Asaro and his son, Jerome Asaro, 55, are charged with stealing $1.25 . million in gold salts from a Federal Express employee in February 1984. They are also accused of robbery conspiracy in the theft of $1 million . from an armored car in the mid-1980s. Three . others defendants, Jack Bonventre, 45; Thomas 'Tommy D' Di Fiore, 70; . and John 'Bazoo' Ragano, 52, are charged with multiple crimes, including . racketeering and extortion, unrelated to the Lufthansa heist, officials . said. Jerome Asaro and . Ragano, wearing baggy sweatsuits and sneakers, pleaded not guilty to all . charges in Brooklyn on Thursday. Bonventre did not enter a plea as his . lawyer was not yet present. Di Fiore was not present in court. Much of the money from the 1978 heist has not been recovered, DeStefano, who writes for Newsday, said. 'Some . of it went up the chain in tribute to the Luccheses, some of it went to . Burke and his businesses and some of it is still unaccounted for,' he . claimed.

Scroll down for video . Scam: Mohammed Omar Gulzar, known as Bobby, employed 25 people to file fake insurance claims after their bus collided with a Vauxhall Zafira in Sheffield, South Yorkshire . Genuine passengers were bemused as people threw themselves to the floor, and one man ran into the windscreen, after the low-speed crash, Sheffield Crown Court heard. Afterwards, 25 people made claims for whiplash. Sentencing the gang at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday, Judge Graham Robinson said: 'The idea that cash-for-crash is a victimless crime needs to be rebuffed immediately. He added: 'The fact that this criminal enterprise was a failure does not make the offences less serious and the sentence I give will hopefully serve as a deterrent to anyone considering taking part in a cash for crash scam. Suspicious: South Yorkshire Police discovered Gulzar's fake companies after the unusual bus incident . Jailed: Mohammed Omar Gulzar (left) was jailed for four-and-a-half years, and his employee Shoaib Mawaz (right) for three-and-a-half for at least 39 orchestrated collisions in a bid to claim £500,000 in insurance . 'Cash for crash is not a crime that pays.' Gulzar and Nawaz were sentenced to four-and-a-half years and three-and-a-half years, respectively for conspiring to defraud insurance companies between January 1 and July 31, 2011. Bus driver Adam Herbert, 26, was jailed for 20 months. Gulzar, his employee Shoaib Nawaz, 24, and two other men - Javed Khan, 46, and Sami Selam, 36 - were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud following a six-week trial in September 2013. Sheffield Crown Court heard police enquiries began after the smash at the junction of Scott Road and Ellesmere Road in Sheffield. Enquiries by bus company First revealed that there had been a spike in passenger numbers on that particular day. Involved: Saeeda Ali (left) and bus driver Adam Herbert (right) were two of dozens involved in the scams from January to July 2011. Herbert was driving the single-decked bus in the elaborate Vauxhall Zafira incident . Police branded the 'crash for cash' scams, involving Osman Bakri (left) and Sami Selam (right), 'professionally-planned' and 'highly-organised' Accounts of the collision given by bus driver Adam Herbert and the driver of the Zafira, Safaida Bi - also in on the scam - varied greatly, while genuine passengers were bemused by the actions of others on the bus. One woman told police how following the collision, which 'barely made her sway', one man ran past her and headbutted the windscreen. Another genuine passenger said that she was provided with collision report sheets prior to the crash even taking place. The case - dubbed Operation Lollipop - led South Yorkshire Police to a Sheffield-based accident claims company City Claims 4 U, and Gulzar's fake hire-car operation, CCC Hire 4 U. Officers worked closely with the Insurance Fraud Bureau, a London-based industry organisation, and FirstGroup to identify and gather evidence. They identified suspects involved in ten 'road crashes' at Halifax, Sheffield and Rotherham between January 1 and July 31 2011.

Both evoke an urban working-class pride in family, home and hard work, as well as a sense of community and making the best of a tough situation. Scroll down for video . Looking smart: Martin Hanchett (left) stands in his school uniform on the street and Nina Clayton, aged 6, all dressed up for the church procession . The girl’s dress is made from parachute silk; a luxury commodity only made available by a parent’s involvement in the recently ended world war. In that respect the photographs are wholly unremarkable. Thousands like them must exist. And yet they are not mundane. In their modest good order they are both shocking and sad, because the street in which they were taken is today the most notorious in Britain; made so by a television programme which has shown the current residents’ lifestyles, squalor, habitual criminality and an overall social disintegration. James Turner Street in Winson Green, Birmingham, is infamous after being featured in Channel 4’s highly controversial series Benefits Street. Today the majority of residents in the Victorian terrace houses claim benefits. The road is filthy, with rubbish strewn across the street and dirty mattresses abandoned on the pavements. Many of those featured are criminals, drunks or class-A drug addicts. Neighbours rob each other and children fend for themselves while their parents smoke and drink outside. Nina Clayton, aged 6, pictured middle, with her family all dressed up for the church procession . But it was not always this way. This week, we spoke to members of families who lived in the ‘golden age’ of ‘Benefits Street’ in the Forties through to the Seventies. They have long since moved away and now say they are saddened by how far their former home has fallen and the ‘scrounging vermin’ who live there now. Martin Hanchett was the small chap in the cap and wrinkled sock. His family lived two doors away from the house now inhabited by the mother known as White Dee. His great-grandparents, grandparents and his mother Helen all lived on the road, the family having settled there at the start of the 20th century. Mr Hanchett, 65, said the family all worked in manual jobs, some from as young as ten years old, and moved to the area from Nottingham because Birmingham was renowned as the ‘city of 1,000 trades’. The women would work in cafes or wash neighbours’ clothes for change, he recalled. ‘Everybody was working,’ he said. ‘People had to because there was no welfare. Attitudes are different now. There’s a lot of people on benefits today. My parents and grandparents wouldn’t believe it. When they were alive, if you didn’t work you didn’t get anything.’ The retired engraver, who now lives in Halesowen, West Midlands, with his wife said he was dismayed at the state of the street and how moral standards have disappeared. ‘Nobody ever swore like that when we were there. If you were caught swearing in the street and a passer-by heard you, he’d give you a clip round the ear. That’s how it was. ‘The way they now swear at the young kids is dreadful. ‘I can’t remember as a kid any robberies or thefts. I never knew anyone who was a drunk. There wasn’t anyone taking drugs. There was never rubbish on the road like there is now. ‘You kept your doors open. It used to be a nice road, with privet bushes outside every house. People had pride in their appearance. ‘It was a community — a village within a city, really. Changes: The street is now featured in Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street . ‘A lot of people I know can’t bring themselves to watch the programme. We’re shocked at what has happened to the street.’ Nina Clayton was six when her photograph was taken as she wore the parachute silk dress, made by her mother. In the Forties she lived with her parents and two brothers a few houses away from where White Dee now lives. ‘Our house was a small grocer’s shop,’ she said. ‘I was only five or six at the time but I remember it so well, cigarettes kept under the counter for regulars, sacks of liquorice root, the fish and chip shop around the corner where you could get free scratchings.’ John Cahill, 56, lived on the street in the Sixties and Seventies before leaving to join the forces. He is now a bricklayer and lives in Wolverhampton with his wife, with whom he has three adult children. He said: ‘It infuriates me that these people are wallowing in their mire. They enjoy the lifestyle they are leading. It just dismays me to see what sort of vermin have colonised the area. They have turned it into a cesspit. ‘It is such a shame because of all the happy memories I had growing up there. I am ashamed to tell anyone I spent my childhood there because people will think I am as bad as the people in the programme. But my parents and their neighbours were a world apart. Two residents sit drinking beer on their doorstep while talking to a child on a bicycle . Piles of rubbish are often seen scattered all over the street - which was very different in the post-war era . ‘My parents would be disgusted if they saw what it was like now.’ Mr Cahill was brought up with his three siblings on James Turner Street by his father Joseph, a lathe turner, and mother Edna, who worked in a factory. He said all the residents worked, even most mothers, and they took pride in their children’s discipline and appearance. ‘My dad worked all the time. My mum was also at work. They couldn’t afford not to. ‘You never swore in front of your parents because you knew what you were going to get if you answered back. Now the children are effing and blinding, and that’s even the toddlers. ‘I can’t believe how bad it has got. It is filthy now. There is this greed — people want something for nothing.’ The road is believed to be named after James Turner, a 19th-century master at the local King Edward’s School, who never missed a day  of work. ‘He went out, worked hard and earned that honour,’ says Mr Cahill. ‘Now his name is associated with everything he was not.’","Photographs taken of residents of James Turner Street in post-war Britain .

Reforms to the formula used to ration expensive medicines will make it harder for NHS patients to get new life-saving drugs, warn campaigners. The rationing body, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), plans to lower the cost threshold for new treatments and end the priority given to patients who are dying. The reforms are a shift to a system which the Government pledged would allow patients to ‘access the drugs and treatments their doctors think they need’. It involves changes to a complex formula, known as quality adjusted life years (QALY). Reforms to the formula used to ration expensive medicines will make it harder for NHS patients to get new life-saving drugs, warn campaigners . NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon said the rationing body would exceed the new £20,000 limit in exceptional circumstances . This determines the cost-effectiveness of a treatment by working out how it extends a life compared with existing treatments. Treatments have previously been approved if the cost is below £20,000, but may also get the go-ahead if they fall between £20,000 and £30,000. The proposals delete the £30,000 upper limit – which means many drugs currently approved, such as the breast cancer treatment Herceptin, would have had a slim chance of getting a green light from NICE if applying in future. And some drugs approved under ‘end of life criteria’ – ones which might extend a dying patient’s life by precious weeks or months – will also face a tough battle. Andrew Wilson, of the Rarer Cancers . Foundation, said: ‘Far from making it easier for patients to get the . latest cancer drugs, these changes set the bar even higher.’ NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon said the rationing body would exceed the new £20,000 limit in exceptional circumstances.

A judge has pleaded for an end to the ‘untold misery’ of a wealthy family  tearing itself apart over ownership of a £50million business. The divorce of engineering and property tycoon Richard Shield, 72, and Susan, 63, has set mother against son and brother against sister in the High Court. Lawyers have already clocked up £1million in fees in what Mrs Shield says is her principled fight to make sure that her ‘old-fashioned patriarch’ husband does not financially favour their son, Christopher, 36, over herself and their daughters. Battle: Susan Shield has won a £50m fight with her estranged husband Richard over their divorce . Judge Nicholas Francis QC said: . ‘No-one could fail to observe, and to be dismayed and saddened, by the . fact that, after 43 years of marriage, this couple’s divorce has . involved not only themselves but their adult children.’ And . Mr  Shield’s mental health had gone into such decline that he had at . one point been compulsorily committed to a mental hospital. Daughters . Alexandra, 40, and Nicola, 39, had tried to play down their brother’s . success in running the Leicester-based business, R.A. Shield Holdings, . said  the judge. And Mrs Shield had suggested that her son was being ‘opportunistic’ in supporting his father’s case against her. Legal battle: Susan Shield has battled her husband over £50m at the High Court in London . In . a preliminary success for Mrs Shield, the judge ruled that her . husband’s controlling shareholding in the company – by far his largest . asset – must go into the pot for division between them in their divorce. Despite paying tribute to father-of-four Christopher for his role in . rescuing the company from a crisis in 2002 and re-building it, the judge . ruled that, primarily for tax reasons, Mr Shield had never . categorically agreed that he held his shares in trust for his son. Mr Shield, the court heard, is now being cared for at his home in Queniborough, Leicestershire, but did not testify in court. Lamenting . that his ruling did not signal the end of the dispute, Judge Francis . said it was ‘a matter of deep regret’ that such a bitter ‘family . squabble’ had not been resolved by agreement. He . added: 'It must be hoped that ... the family can yet find a way to . resolve the  dispute without further bitterness and haemorrhage of . costs.’ Christopher Shield has told the MailOnline he is looking at fighting the decision. He said: ‘I’m obviously disappointed in the result and, together with my legal team, am considering an appeal. 'I . would like to stress that the company will not be affected by what is . effectively a private, family dispute that has unfortunately been played . out in public.’","Richard and Susan Shield are divorcing after a 43-year marriage .

A ‘young but predatory’ child abuser convicted of 49 sexual offences against young boys, was jailed for 18 years on Friday. Christopher Mancini will spend a decade in custody and was banned from contact with children and from using the internet after he was sentenced for the attacks on 13 boys. Police have urged anyone with information about possible further offences by Mancini to come forward. He had been convicted of 34 sexual offences - including 24 of causing or inciting sexual activity, five of sexual assault, four of making indecent images of children and one of rape - following an earlier trial. Mancini, 19, of Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, had also pleaded guilty at Lewes Crown Court to 15 offences of sexual activity with a child, involving three boys, one of whom was one of the 10 boys who gave evidence at the trial. Six of the offences took place online involving three boys in other areas of the UK. All the other sexual activity offences took place in Mid-Sussex involving boys known to Mancini. He was found not guilty of one offence of rape. Sentencing Mancini yesterday Judge Richard Hayward said the teenager operated using a 'combination of bribes and threats'.

The . former radio DJ and Top of the Pops presenter said he had met millions . of people during his long career but had always acted professionally. He . accused those who claim he sexually assaulted them of ‘imagining’ the . attacks and dismissed their allegations as ‘ridiculous’. In . 17 hours of police interviews, Travis, known as DLT, said he was an . easy target in a money-grabbing culture. Southwark Crown Court was told . he described the allegations as ‘complete and utter nonsense’ and . ‘absolute c**p’. He claimed that many of his accusers came forward simply to make money from the media. Reading . from the transcripts, prosecutor Teresa Hay said Travis felt the . allegations against him were ‘degrading’ and he could barely remember . the women involved. ‘He said if he had touched someone’s breasts he . would admit it as it was considered to be flirtatious at the time and no . one thought much about it,’ she said. ‘He . said he did not take advantage of people.

'The Press had no morals . and now his morals were being questioned.’ Travis, . 68, appearing in court under his real name David Patrick Griffin, sat . in silence as sections of the police interviews were read to the jury.

He is on trial accused of indecently . and sexually assaulting 11 women, the youngest of whom was 15 years old, . over a period of 32 years.

A mother-of-three who was told she had beaten a rare form of cancer is now preparing memory boxes and birthday cards for her children after being given the devastating news she has just three months to live. Debra McNaughton, from Waltham, Lincolnshire has prepared three memory boxes for each of her children, and has hand-written cards congratulating them on their future birthdays, weddings and first jobs. Just 21 days ago the 39-year-old believed she was cancer-free after beating a rare form of appendix cancer in June 2013. Heartbreaking: Debra McNaughton and her husband Jamie with son Oliver, two and Connor, 17. She has prepared mementos for the boys as her cancer has returned . However, the mother-of-three was devastated to be told her cancer had returned - and it was terminal - after her latest scan just three weeks ago. Mrs McNaughton, mother to Connor, 17, Courtney, 16, and Oliver, two, said: 'I just want to spend as much time as I can with my children and I want them to always remember me. 'I don't want them to miss out on not having a mum so I have hand-written cards for each of their birthdays, weddings and first jobs. I want them to know how proud of them I am - even if I'm not here.' She has saved £2,000 which will be divided up between her three children in each of their birthday cards. Scans revealed two growths on Debra's ovaries. At first doctors believed they were benign cysts, but further tests suggested she was in the early stages of ovarian cancer . Mrs McNaughton has also created memory boxes which contain letters to each child, telling them about the day they were born, how proud she is of them and words of wisdom for the future. She said: 'I am determined stay positive for my children. I want them to remember me as a loving mum, who would do anything for them.' She was first diagnosed with a rare form of appendix cancer in 2012 and she underwent a 14-hour operation to remove her bowel, parts of her intestine, gall bladder, spleen and diaphragm. Several lymph nodes were removed, and she also underwent a 90-minute treatment with heated chemotherapy drugs. After six months of gruelling treatment, Mrs McNaughton and her husband Jamie, 30, were overjoyed to find out the cancer had gone. For eight months Debra began to rebuild her life, after having three more scans which came back as clear. The family were on a ten-day family holiday to Egypt in February 2012 when Debra began to feel sharp pains on the right side of her abdomen . She said: 'I had even applied for a new job and I was due to start in January.' But when Mrs McNaughton went for a scan on January 4, she was devastated to find out the cancer has returned, and this time there was nothing that could be done. She said: 'The cancer has spread to my lymph nodes and the doctors told me there is nothing more they can do. Even if I went through chemo again it would only give me a small amount of time. 'I am now determined to make the most of the time with my children and by creating memory boxes and writing cards I hope that they will be able to remember me when I am gone.' Debra and Jamie pictured at their wedding in June 2012 . Debra was terrified that Oliver wouldn't have any memories of her before she passed away . The mother has located three cancer specialists in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland - who she hopes may be able to perform life saving surgery on her. 'It will cost around £30,000 for the surgery- if they can help. I am hopeful but it isn't the sort of money I have lying around,' she said. 'I can't afford to waste time being low or negative - I have a family to care for. 'Every time I look at my little boy, it gives me the strength to try harder.' She is now hoping she will be able to raise the money she needs so she can have another shot at life. With the help of St Andrew's Hospice volunteers, Grimsby, Mrs McNaughton also hopes to make lasting video messages for her children. 'I want them to have magical memories of me - as a positive mum who loved them.'","Debra McNaughton, 39, thought she had beaten appendix cancer .

Jessica and Tamzin, of Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, were visiting their father at Christmas when Easter, 43, crashed on the A47 at Walsoken, near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. Jessica Portor, left, and her big sister Tamzin, 10, died when the car being driven by Marie Easter, the new girlfriend of their father, veered off the road . Both girls suffered devastating head injuries and they were declared dead at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn. Easter had loved the girls as if they were her own and was 'a broken woman' who would live with their tragic deaths for the rest of her life, Norwich Crown Court heard yesterday. The car's back two tyres had illegal low treads and all four tyres had the wrong pressure. A police accident investigator said the tyres could have contributed to the accident. Easter, of Terrington St Clement, near King's Lynn, admitted two charges of causing death by careless driving on December 27, 2012. She escaped with minor injuries along with Mr Portor, 38, and his son Liam, 12. Jessica was probably not wearing a seatbelt at the time, the court was told. Easter initially claimed she swerved to avoid an oncoming car but Lindsay Cox, prosecuting, said witnesses said there was no reason why she made the dramatic manoeuvre . The girls' devastated parents said the siblings were 'our little angels' and could never be replaced. They said Tamzin was always happy, who loved singing and helping people.

Human rights campaigners have called for the immediate release of a British man sentenced to death under Pakistan's blasphemy laws. A judge convicted and sentenced Mohammad Asghar, from Edinburgh, on Thursday following a trial. Mr Asghar was arrested in 2010 in Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, for claiming to be the Prophet Mohammed in letters sent to various officials, according to prosecutor Javed Gul. Strict: Scores of people have been arrested in Pakistan under the country's harsh blasphemy laws, which carry sentences of life in prison or the death penalty, though executions are rarely carried out . But a lawyer who defended Mr Asghar said he suffers from mental illness and the case was really a property dispute. Amnesty International's deputy Asia Pacific director Polly Truscott said: 'Mohammad Asghar is now facing the gallows simply for writing a series of letters. He does not deserve punishment. No one should be charged on the basis of this sort of conduct. 'The blasphemy laws undermine the rule of law, and people facing charges risk death and other harm in detention. 'Pakistan must immediately release Mohammad Ashgar and reform its blasphemy laws to ensure that this will not happen again.' Mr Asghar, a UK citizen of Pakistani origin, returned to Pakistan in 2010 after being treated for paranoid schizophrenia in Edinburgh, the lawyer said. He later fell into a dispute with a tenant who brought the blasphemy complaint against him to police. Amnesty International called on Pakistan Prime Minster Nawaz Sharif to release Mohammad Asghar . A doctor treating Mr Asghar in Edinburgh said in a letter dated June 2011 that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and believed that the Pakistani and British governments were attempting to control him. The letter was provided to The Associated Press by his lawyer, who asked not to be named for fear of threats and violence. Prosecutors disputed that Mr Ashgar had mental problems. The British High Commission in Islamabad said it was aware of Mr Asghar's case and provided assistance to him. Lawyers said they will appeal against the conviction, and that they are worried about his mental condition and physical safety in prison. Another British citizen, Masud Ahmad, of the Ahmadi sect, was imprisoned in November 2012 for reciting a passage from the Koran, a prohibited act for Ahmadis under the country's blasphemy laws. Ms Truscott said: ""The Pakistani authorities must immediately and unconditionally release both Mohammad Asghar and Masud Ahmad and guarantee their safety and that of their families. Several individuals have been attacked, some even killed following charges of blasphemy. 'At a time when Pakistan is reeling from a spate of abuses which perpetrators seek to justify as a defence of religious sentiments, reform of the blasphemy laws is more urgent than ever.' A Scottish Government spokesman said: ""We're concerned about this case and can confirm that we have been in touch with the FCO who will keep us informed of the situation. 'The Scottish Government strongly opposes the death penalty in all circumstances. As a minimum we would urge the Pakistani authorities to abide by the moratorium they have on the death penalty. 'Our thoughts are with Mr Asghar's family at this difficult time.' Scores of people have been arrested in Pakistan under the country's harsh blasphemy laws, which carry sentences of life in prison or the death penalty, though executions are rarely carried out. Rights groups say the laws often are exploited for personal gain and that members of Pakistan's minority population are disproportionately targeted. People accused of blasphemy also have been attacked and killed by angry vigilante mobs. Few leaders in the predominantly Muslim country have shown willingness to tackle the contentious issue, especially after two prominent politicians who criticised the blasphemy law were murdered in recent years. One of the politicians was shot by his own bodyguard, who then attracted adoring crowds.","Mohammad Asghar was accused of claiming to be the Prophet Mohammed .

An Oklahoma man who was convicted of stabbing a close friend to death more than a quarter-century ago was executed Thursday. Kenneth Eugene Hogan, 52, was pronounced dead at 6:13 p.m. after he received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Hogan admitted to stabbing 21-year-old Lisa Stanley but said he did so in self-defense after she lunged at him with a knife. Executed: Kenneth Hogan, left and right in 1988, was executed on Thursday. He was convicted of first-degree murder for the . January 1988 stabbing death of Lisa Stanley at her home in Oklahoma City . Prosecutors said Hogan stabbed the woman more than 25 times in the back, neck and chest in January 1988, then knocked over several objects in her Oklahoma City apartment to make it appear as though she had been robbed. When interrogated, he gave police inconsistent statements. ‘I am guilty for what I'm here for, and I take full responsibility for my actions,’ Hogan said in his final statement, as he lay strapped to the gurney in the death chamber. ‘And to Lisa's family, I say I'm sorry that I can't undo it. ‘And I'm sorry to my family for all the pain I've caused,’ he said. Hogan went on to thank the family members who came to witness his death. ‘There's a chemical taste in my mouth,’ Hogan said, seconds after the drugs were administered.Hogan turned to look back at his family one last time. ‘I'm going. I'm going. I'm going,’ he exclaimed. Kenneth Eugene Hogan, 52, was pronounced dead at 6:13 p.m. after he received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester . Hogan's face grew ashen as he took his last breaths. About six minutes passed from the time the dose was administered until Hogan was pronounced dead. Norma Tressler, Stanley's mother, said in a statement after Hogan was executed that he never attempted to make amends to her family for what he did. ‘He has shown absolutely no remorse for his actions,’ she said. The state Pardon and Parole Board denied clemency for Hogan this month by a 4-1 vote. Hogan is the second person to be executed in Oklahoma this year. Hogan's initial conviction was overturned in 1999 by an appeals court that said the jury should've been allowed to consider a verdict of manslaughter. Oklahoma appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 2000 refused to reinstate Hogan's conviction. A different jury in 2003 convicted him again and sentenced him to die. ‘Kenneth Eugene Hogan was sentenced to death by a jury of his peers for the heinous stabbing of Lisa Renee Stanley, who was a young wife and a promising student,’ Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said in a statement Thursday. ‘My thoughts and prayers are with Lisa's family and friends.’ Randy Bauman, Hogan's attorney, declined to comment earlier this week. Earlier this month, Michael Lee Wilson, 38, was put to death for orchestrating a deadly assault on a convenience store worker in Tulsa in 1995 . Stanley's relatives wrote to the state in December, saying Hogan has had ‘26 years of appeals on his behalf, making our family relive that day over and over again.’ ‘You destroyed me and my family,’ Tressler said. ‘I want peace and justice to be served for my daughter. I want for this nightmare to finally end. And on Jan. 23, 2014, I pray for closure. It is well past due.’ Stanley's mother-in-law, Frieda Stanley, wrote that no amount of time could erase the memories she still has of the day of the crime and its aftermath. ‘Lisa's little dog barking in the background, interviews at the police station and later picking out clothing for Lisa to wear at her funeral that would cover her wounds,’ she wrote. ‘Lisa's death and how she died is always with us and has shaped and formed us as individuals and a family.’ At the time of Hogan's trial, his defense team said Hogan and Stanley began arguing after smoking marijuana together, and Stanley tried to stab him. According to lawyers, he took the knife from her and then she attempted to attack him with another one. Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agent Bob Horn, who worked the crime scene, described Stanley's killing as ‘cruel and heinous.’ He also said the large volume of her blood found in different rooms throughout her apartment ‘showed that she must have been suffering a long time before she died.’ ‘Justice demands that the execution of Kenneth Hogan be carried out,’ Horn wrote in a December letter to the parole board.

Spiralling: Director General Tony Hall will be told BBC must pick up cost of free TV licences for the elderly . The BBC will be told to pick up the spiralling cost to taxpayers of providing free TV licences to the elderly under plans being drawn up by the Conservatives. The bill for keeping licences free for the over-75s has risen to £600million, and an ageing population means that one in six households now gets the benefit regardless of income. There is growing controversy over the cost of pensioner benefits, which have been left untouched by the Government despite deep cuts to working-age welfare. The Daily Mail has learned that senior ministers are planning to tell the BBC it must absorb the annual cost of maintaining one of the main pensioner perks. Currently, the annual cost is met by the Department for Work and Pensions. It is thought that the plans will enrage the BBC, which has previously warned the Government that any attempts to cut its budget could result in the loss of channels such as BBC3 or BBC4. Free TV licences for the over-75s were introduced to win over the ‘grey vote’ by Gordon Brown in the 2001 election. David Cameron pledged to maintain universal pensioner benefits – including the TV licence, the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes – until 2015. But there are tensions in the Coalition over whether to maintain the commitment beyond the next election. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has been pushing for a review, and the Lib Dems have insisted they will not agree to further cuts to working-age welfare proposed by the Tories – such as limits on housing benefit for under-25s and an end to child benefits for jobless families with more than two children – unless the costs of universal pensioner benefits are also slashed. Three Tory ministers have privately told the Mail that forcing the BBC to pick up the cost for over-75 licences would allow the Government to say that while the benefit is to be maintained, taxpayers will save big sums. ‘The bill for this should be met by the BBC and it will be top of the list in the negotiations over charter renewal,’ said one. The number of homes claiming a free over-75 licence has soared by more than a million since 2001 to 4.25million, while the cost to the taxpayer has more than doubled from £308million to over £600million. Increases in longevity suggest that the cost will double again by 2030, when the average person is forecast to live long enough to be able to claim a free licence for more than a decade. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has pushed for a review universal pensioner benefits - including the TV licence, the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes . The move to land the BBC with the cost of maintaining free TV licences will pitch the Government into a row with the corporation, which will claim the cost could be absorbed only if it saves money by closing some services. The £600million-a-year cost roughly matches the entire £575million budget of BBC2. BBC insiders have already claimed that an extension of a six-year licence fee freeze imposed by the Government until 2016 would be impossible to manage. But ministers point to inflated salaries for executives and presenters, and vast pay-offs to departing staff, as evidence that the corporation can afford to make savings. Ministers are unlikely to agree to any significant increase in the licence fee, which raises £3.6billion a year to fund the BBC’s activities. The BBC Trust fought ‘tooth and nail’ against a move to force it to meet the cost of free licences for over-75s when it was previously considered in 2010. BBC executives will argue that the broadcaster should not be asked to pay for a perk that it did not introduce or ask to be introduced. The current BBC charter expires in 2016, and talks on the future of its funding will begin soon. Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, suggested that asking the taxpayer to pay for the provision of free TV licences for wealthy pensioners cannot be justified. He says the issue should be considered as part of a wider review of how the BBC is funded. ‘It’s very difficult to justify why my mother doesn’t have to pay a licence fee,’ he said. ‘Means testing it would be administratively more complicated but in the present climate I can see no real reason why it remains a universal benefit.’","BBC may have to foot the £600million bill for free TV licenses for over-75s .

Suicidal gunman: Alistair Bell, who was shot dead by police officer after an armed siege, rang his father and asked how best to kill himself, an inquest heard . A gunman in a police siege rang his father to ask about the best way of committing suicide, an inquest heard. Alistair Bell, 42, was still shooting at police officers surrounding his home in Kirkheaton, West Yorkshire, when he called his father, Gordon, and said he wanted to kill himself. Mr Bell senior told his son, who was later shot dead by a police marksman, where to aim the gun and advised him: 'Don't miss', an inquest heard. He told the inquest into his son's death that Bell told him 'I've shot two coppers', and said it was pointless trying to talk him out of it as he knew he was determined not to go back to hospital. Bell fired 34 shots, wounding one officer, during a lengthy stand-off that began when one officer went to arrest him after he allegedly threatened a former friend. The jury at Bradford Crown Court heard that at one point during the six-hour stand-off, Bell called his father saying he wanted to kill himself and asked: 'What's the best way of doing it?' His father said: 'Do it from the side of the head.  Don't miss.  It will be just like someone giving you a crack over the head,' the Huddersfield Examiner reported. Mr Bell said he knew his son, whom he described as being his best friend, didn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison. The siege, on 27 December 2010, began when Bell pointed a gun at an officer who went to arrest him.  Bell then shot another officer, who was wearing body armour, in the back, injuring his shoulder. Armed officers were sent to the house and the stand-off continued into the night, during which Bell shot out of the window of his home and sent text messages to family and friends, as well as to a police negotiator. Bell, who was known to have a history of violence, told the police he had booby-trapped the house and threatened to blow them all up. Scene: Bell  is said to have used this window to fire several bullets at police during the six-hour stand-off .

The former deputy speaker Nigel Evans today denied nine sexual offence charges against seven men when he appeared before a judge. The MP for Ribble Valley in Lancashire entered formal not guilty pleas during the pre-trial hearing at Preston Crown Court. He stood in the dock, hands clasped at his front, to repeat 'not guilty' as each charge was put to him. The 56-year-old is accused of two counts of indecent assault, six of sexual assault and one of rape. The indictment includes an extra charge of sexual assault which was only added to the charge sheet today. All of the offences are alleged to have taken place from 2002 to April 1, last year. Evans resigned as Commons deputy speaker after he was charged on September 10. The 10-minute hearing was taken up by legal argument as the court prepares for the forthcoming trial. The judge, Mr Justice King, reminded the press none of the seven complainants, all adult males, must be publicly identified in their reports. Evans was granted bail by the judge until his trial date, which has been set for March 10. 'Thank you, my lord,' he replied. The indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed between January 1 2002 and January 1 2004; the sexual assaults - said to be touching without consent - between January 1 2009 and April 1 last year; and the rape between March 29 and April 1 last year. Evans made a personal statement in the House the day after he was charged, claiming that facing the allegations was as hard as dealing with the deaths of his mother and brother in the past few years.

In danger: Snowden took refuge in Moscow to evade treason charges after disclosing U.S. state secrets on NSA intelligence gathering, and now fears for his life and wants to increase security . The allegations have come only days after President Barack Obama spoke last Friday about the trimming the power of U.S. intelligence services, reacting to the leaks by Snowden. Speaking at the U.S. Department of Justice on January 17, he called for new privacy safeguards and said he had stopped the NSA spy taps on friendly world leaders. The president said he would be ending the NSA's hoarding of telephone ""metadata"", informaion that shows the detail and destination of calls, but not their content, agreeing with critics who said that the program could open the door to more intrusion. However, Obama has decided that he . will allow bulk phone data sweeps of the citizens living in the U.S. to . continue as an anti-terror tool. He said: 'I believe we need a new approach. I am therefore ordering a transition that will end the Section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists, and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the government holding this bulk meta-data. Since Obama's long awaited speech, Snowden has had fears for his life according to his Russian lawyer. Explicit threats to kill him were made anonymously by Pentagon and National Security Agency officials, alleged Anatoly Kucherena. In an interview with Russian news channel Vesti, he said: 'There are real threats to his life out there that actually do exist. ‘These statements call for physical retribution against Edward Snowden.’","Snowden was accused of stealing colleagues' passwords to get secrets .

A brain-damaged woman had the capacity to decide whether to have sex, despite her family insisting otherwise, an appeal court has ruled. The woman has been at the centre of litigation in the Court of Protection over whether she has the mental capacity to make decisions about having sexual relations. The three Court of Appeal judges also concluded that courts could make general evaluations about the capacity of disabled people to make decisions about sex. The woman has been at the centre of litigation in the Court of Protection over whether she has the mental capacity to make decisions about having sexual relations . They said it would be impossible for a court to conduct an assessment every time a disabled person, whose capacity to consent to sex was questionable, showed an interest in having a sexual encounter. The Court of Appeal upheld a ruling by a High Court judge sitting in the Court of Protection, following a challenge by the woman’s mother. Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that the woman, who is in her 40s, had the capacity to make decisions about sex. He said she had been sexually active before suffering a brain injury, understood the 'rudiments of the sexual act' and had a basic understanding of contraception and of the risks of sexually-transmitted diseases. The woman’s mother argued that he had been mistaken. Judges said the woman could not be identified. 'In our view there is no substance in the criticism of the judge’s conduct of the hearing,' said Sir Brian Leveson, the most senior judge on the appeal panel. 'We dismiss the appeal.' Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that the woman, who is in her 40s, had the capacity to make decisions about sex . Sir Brian, president of the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court, said it was right that people did not consent to 'sex in general' but to an act of sex with a particular person at a particular time. And he said the focus of the criminal law was always on a specific sexual event. But he added: 'The fact that a person either does or does not consent to sexual activity with a particular person at a fixed point in time, or does or does not have capacity to give such consent, does not mean that it is impossible, or legally impermissible, for a court assessing capacity to make a general evaluation which is not tied down to a particular partner, time and place. 'Going further, we accept the submission made to us to the effect that it would be totally unworkable for a local authority or the Court of Protection to conduct an assessment every time an individual over whom there was doubt about his or her capacity to consent to sexual relations showed signs of immediate interest in experiencing a sexual encounter with another person. 'On a pragmatic basis, if for no other reason, capacity to consent to future sexual relations can only be assessed on a general and non-specific basis.' Judges said the woman suffered a brain injury during surgery more than three years ago. Litigation started after concerns were raised about a man she had been involved with. They said the man had a 'significant criminal record' for inappropriate behaviour and the woman’s mother had made various allegations against him.'","The woman has been at the centre of litigation in the Court of Protection .

A 71-year-old man who believed his younger Thai bride was cheating on him and treating him like a 'cash cow' confronted her with a meat cleaver, a court heard. Michael West later told police his wife Bangon, 50, had been using him as a 'walking ATM' for herself and her family in Thailand. He complained he had spent £24,000 on a house for her next door to her sister in Thailand and more than £60,000 on her and other members of her family. 'All I am is a cash cow, a walking ATM,' he said. 'I have been taken for a fool.' He said although he and his wife had separated late last year she was still seeing him each weekend for sex and happily accepting expensive gifts from him for her birthday and Christmas. West, of Longlevens, Gloucester, admitted violent harassment of his wife and being in possession of a knife in a public place - the Thai restaurant where she worked in Gloucester. He was jailed for a year. Prosecutor Janine Wood said the marriage had been deteriorating for several years and in 2010 West was cautioned for cutting up her clothing after a row. Last year in October or November they parted because the relationship had deteriorated so much, she said. But on January 4 this year he went into the kitchen of the restaurant where she was working in Southgate Street, Gloucester, backed her up against a fridge, grabbed her hair and produced a small knife from his jacket pocket. He asked her: 'Do you want to die?' and pointed the knife at her. He let her go and put the knife back in his pocket but then pulled out a meat cleaver and said 'Do you want this one?' 'He says he loved her deeply and struggled to come to terms with the break up of their relationship at the end of last year' Lloyd Jenkins, defending . Mrs Wood said 'She was scared and ran into the public area of the restaurant where she managed to take a photo of him on her mobile phone showing him with the cleaver.' He also had blood on his hand, she said. Mrs West managed then to film him for fifteen minutes as he made verbal threats and gestures to her in the restaurant, added Ms Wood. Mrs West did not report the incident to police and was in the restaurant two days later when her husband arrived and picked up a knife which he put in his pocket. She ran out of the restaurant to avoid him and she then called the police. He was arrested at 2.20pm on January 7 in the Regal pub in Gloucester and found to have a small knife in his pocket. In a statement, Mrs West asked the court to pass a sentence which would help him overcome his alcohol addiction. Lloyd Jenkins, defending, said West now finally accepts that the marriage has broken down. 'He split from his first wife in 2004 after she cheated on him at the end of a 35-year-marriage,' said Mr Jenkins. 'They have two children who are in the public gallery. 'That left him somewhat vulnerable. He suffered a breakdown. He then met Bangon and they married seven to eight years ago. 'He says he loved her deeply and struggled to come to terms with the break up of their relationship at the end of last year. 'She had moved out of their home in June or July but every weekend she would go back to him and there would be sexual intercourse. 'He was getting mixed messages. He was struggling to cope with that. 'In 2010 he had been cautioned for criminal damage for cutting up her clothes. That was when she had been away in Ilford with a boyfriend cheating on him. 'He says he was a walking ATM. He said he spent £24,000 building her a house next door to her sister in Thailand, he gave her sons £9,000 to buy taxis to set up business out there. 'He says he has spent in excess of £60,000 on her and her family. ""All I am is a cash cow, a walking ATM"" he says, and ""I have been played for a fool."" 'On December 13 he gave her £220 worth of gifts for her birthday and she accepted them. On 24th December he gave her Christmas presents and again she took them. 'She is a 50-year-old woman who takes his money and gifts, goes to his bed once a week but then has another agenda, if I may put it that way. He is a jilted man, he is a broken man. 'He is a man who worked hard all his life and has a supportive family around him. He will be vulnerable in custody because of his age and his high blood pressure.' West Judge Jamie Tabor QC said: 'I am certainly not going to cast aspersions on your wife because it would be unfair to do so. What I am prepared to do is accept that you felt you were being used. 'Whether that is true or not is secondary. You have an alcohol problem and when people with alcohol problems arm themselves with knives the consequences are very often fatal or near fatal.' As well as the 12 months jail term the judge made a restraining order banning West from contacting his wife or going to the restaurant where she works.","Michael West claimed wife Bangon had been using him as a 'walking ATM'

"By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 04:12 EST, 19 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:09 EST, 19 December 2013 . An armed Islamist organisation fighting on the rebel side has established sharia law in northern Syria, which has seen children whipped and adults executed in public, Amnesty International reports today. The Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) control a large part of northern Syria, including the country's biggest city, Aleppo. ISIS are in charge of at least seven 'detention centres' in the area where children as young as eight have been detained, young teens have been flogged, and adults executed after 'trials' lasting just minutes. Al Qaeda group: A man holding the flag of Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) walks across a hill in a propaganda video for the organisation . ISIS, previously known as Al Qaeda in Iraq (AIQ), practice several forms of torture, including electric shocks and stress positions, and regular floggings with rubber generator belts or cables, in secret prisons in al-Raqqa and Aleppo . Several children were among detainees who received severe floggings, according to testimonies obtained by Amnesty International. On one occasion, a father had to endure the screams of pain from his 13-year-old son who was being tormented by his captors in a nearby room. Two other detainees related how they witnessed a child of about 14 receive a flogging of around 100 lashes during an interrogation at Sadd al-Ba’ath, an ISIS prison in al-Raqqa governorate. Meanwhile, another child of who ISIS had accused of stealing a motorbike was flogged 30 or 40 times a day for several days. Striking back: Residents carry an injured man that survived shelling from what activists say were government forces, in Takeek Al-Bab area of Aleppo, one controlled by ISIS . Some of those held by ISIS have been suspected of theft or other crimes, while others have been accused of 'crimes against Islam', which can include everything from smoking to sex outside marriage. Others were seized for challenging ISIS’s rule or because they belonged to other armed groups fighting on the rebel side. ISIS is also suspected of abducting and detaining foreign nationals, including journalists covering the fighting in Syria. The news of ISIS's practices comes just days after a British man died in a Syrian prison, allegedly by his own hand. Syrian officials claim Dr Abbas Khan, a 32-year-old surgeon from South London who had travelled to Aleppo to volunteer at a hospital, hanged himself just days before he was due to be freed on the order of President Bashar al-Assad. The family of Dr Khan, a married father-of-two refute the claim that he would kill himself, and said he had been looking forward to coming home for Christmas. Dr Khan was jailed by Syrian government forces in November last year, accused of entering the country without a visa, and spoke of months of torture at the hands of his captors. The true victims: A Syrian woman carries children following airstrikes on a rebel area of the war-torn northern city of Aleppo . ‘After years in which they were prey . to the brutality of the al-Assad regime, the people of al-Raqqa and . Aleppo are now suffering under a new form of tyranny imposed on them by . ISIS, in which arbitrary detention, torture and executions have become . the order of the day,’ Amnesty International Middle East and North . Africa Director Philip Luther said. ‘Those . abducted and detained by ISIS include children as young as eight who . are held together with adults in the same cruel and inhuman conditions. ‘Flogging . anyone, let alone children, is cruel and inhuman, and a gross abuse of . human rights. ISIS should cease its use of flogging and other cruel . punishments.' ISIS also practice public executions following sharia ‘trials’ at the organisations seven identified detention centres, five in al-Raqqa and two in Aleppo. A witness told Amnesty International workers how four men accused of fighting against ISIS were sentenced to death after trials that lasted barely a minute. Executions are held in public places in towns in al-Raqqa governorate or near Aleppo. At the Sadd al-Ba’ath prison, located near al-Mansura, he local sharia court judge has instituted a reign of terror, presiding over trials wearing an explosive belt. Former detainees accuse him of presiding over grotesquely unfair ‘trials’, lasting no more than a few minutes, where he frequently hands down death sentences. At his direction, detainees have been mercilessly flogged; on at least one occasion, he is said to have personally joined in the torture. Mr Luther added: ‘Gulf states that have voiced support . for the armed groups fighting against the Syrian government should take . action to prevent arms flows, equipment or other support reaching ISIS . in view of its appalling human rights record. ‘The . Turkish government, in particular, should prevent its territory being . used by ISIS to bring in arms and recruits to Syria.’","Islamist organisations have established sharia law in north Syria .

A group of pensioners in Germany are proving that classic films really never get old, as they pose for a calendar recreating some of the most iconic scenes in the history of modern cinema. The cheeky OAPs all live in a retirement home in Essen, Germany, and dressed up as the leading men and women from famous movies. The images, for their annual calendar named 'Classics 2014', includes picture perfect recreations of famous moments from James Bond, Mary Poppins, Titanic, Dirty Dancing and The Blues Brothers.

March: Martha Bajohr, 77, says Willkommen as Liza Minnelli's Sally from Cabaret . A total of 5,000 copies of the calendar were printed and given to retirement home staff members, residents and their families. But since the images made their way onto the web, demand has shot up, and fans from all across the country are trying to get their hands on a copy. The residents are aged from 75 to 98, the oldest being Walter Loeser, who pulled a suave pose on a motorcycle, as he re-enacted a scene from 1969 movie Easy Rider. 'It was really exciting to sit on one of these rides, Walter's companion on the shoot, 90-year-old Kurt Neuhaus, representing Easy Rider's Wyatt told Der Spiegel.

Accused: Brenda Watts was arrested for allegedly stealing $1m from school lunch line . A dinner lady has been accused of stealing more than $1million from pupils' lunch money during five years manning the canteen tills. Former cafeteria manager Brenda Watts has been arrested by police in Fulton County, Georgia. The alleged thefts took place at North Springs High School in north Fulton County. Police claim this was a long-running and extremely profitable theft scheme. A whistleblower has provided detectives with a video from inside the North Springs cafeteria. It apparently Watts bypassing four lines that each had a cash register to keep track of the money, instead taking the money before it could be passed through the records. Now Fulton County school police obtained 10 arrest warrants for Watts. The warrants accuse Watts of stealing $500 a day from the cafeteria. The whistleblower Beth Walsh said the a la carte line had been running 'at least 15 years, up to maybe 20.' The police charge suggest that Watts stole $500 a day. That's $2,500 a week, which is a staggering $90,000 in a school year. Over 15 years, that would be $1,350,000. According to the arrest warrants, Watts lives in a five-bedroom, 5,400 square-foot home in south DeKalb County.

But if you're right, you're doing the right thing,' Walsh said. In a statement issued by Deputy Fulton County School Superintendent Patrick Burke, he said: 'Beyond taking appropriate personnel actions, when a potential crime occurs, we will investigate and work with law enforcement to prosecute to the full extent of the law.'","Former cafeteria manager Brenda Watts is accused of stealing $500 a day .

"PUBLISHED: . 04:36 EST, 15 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:55 EST, 15 January 2014 . The 15-year-old child bride featured on controversial television programme Benefits Street has had a baby with her Romanian migrant 'husband', it has been revealed. The girl was seen on the Channel 4 series on Monday, where she was on screen alongside her husband, who gave his name only as Alex and described the marriage - illegal in both the UK and Romania - as 'alright, no problem'. It has now been revealed that months after documentary makers finished filming the series on James Turner Street in Birmingham, where 90 per cent of residents receive state handouts, the couple had their fist child. Child 'bride': A 20-year-old Romanian, right, boasted to cameras that his 15-year-old 'wife', left, was 'no problem' Boast: 20-year-old Romanian Alex, right, boasted that having a 15-year-old 'wife', left, was 'no problem' The baby girl was reportedly born in a hospital in the city, although the couple were thought to have temporarily left the UK for Romania to sign official papers relating to the three-month-old. The child's birth means the couple are now entitled to receive £88 every month in child benefit, as well as additional tax credits - although it is not known if they intend to claim them. Despite giving his name as Alex, the new father's family said his name was in fact Stefan Stana, while his partner, who was unnamed in the show, is Madalina Balasa, who is now 16. Mother: The girl, named by family members as Madalina Balasa, had the child in October after she turned 16 . Unpleasant: Rubbish is piled on up James Turner Street, Birmingham . They featured on the series as part of a Romanian family, who did not claim benefits but worked as professional bin raiders, trying to scavenge for scrap metal to sell. Stefan's brother Florin confirmed the birth of the child, and said the couple, understood to still be living in Birmingham, had gone to Romania to get papers for the child. 'They have had a baby together,' Florin told The Sun. Ceremony: A wedding video shows the couple being 'married' - despite it being illegal in both the UK and Romania . 'It was born in October - she is called Miruna. Madalina was 16 when the baby was born.' Madalina was just 15 and a half when she and Stefan, then 20, were interviewed for the programme. He was seen boasting to the camera about his . child bride - aged just 15-and-a-half - and defending their union as . 'tradition' on the Channel 4 documentary series. The couple were shown talking about their 'marriage' in Monday's episode. Despite the girl being too young to . legally marry either in Romania or in the UK, her 'husband' said: 'This . scares people in England because she is a minor. 'In my country it’s . alright – no problem.' His wife was also asked if she loved him, replying 'Yes, I love him'. The couple were also seen showing off their wedding photograph, in which Stefan, dressed in a shiny black tuxedo and tie, holding his young bride's hand as she stands next to him in a white wedding dress and veil. Florin said that the couple had got married in Romania. Lib Dem MP John Hemming described child marriage as 'unacceptable' in the wake of the controversial programme. The episode showed Stefan and his family as the subject of a torrid of abuse from their neighbours, especially after the council stopped collecting rubbish after bin bags were torn open. One resident, known by her friends as 'White Dee', said: 'People move into a house and two days later they're rooting through your bin bags, that's not a nice thing and we don't want it on our road.' Another described the Romanians as 'little tramps'. Residents claimed that the situation with the rubbish was so bad, after no collections were made for two weeks, that rats were crawling through the streets. Controversial: The series has been attacked for its portrayal of claimants . The family of 14 had crammed into a small property, built for just four people, which they rented privately for £400 a month. In the programme they were shown rooting through bins looking for things to sell, heaping up disused appliances, pots and pans and old buggies. One family member admitted on the programme that neither her nor any other family members are legally entitled to work in the UK. Instead they make ends meet by collecting scrap - old cookers, microwaves, pots, pans and baby buggies - and selling it on to dealers. They claim to make only around £75 a week from this - barely enough to cover the rent on their home. Only George, a 12-year-old boy who goes to school, could speak English and communicate with their landlord or the neighbours. Notorious: James Turner Street is in the Winson Green area of Birmingham . They found the UK less attractive than they had hoped. At one point the father of the family said: 'In Romania life was much better. We had water, gas and electricity. We had our own house.', while another adds 'This is worse than Romania.' The family was eventually evicted after they couldn't keep up their rent payments, but were soon replaced by another group of Romanians - fourteen men who had come to England on the promise of farm labour, paid at £40 per day. The programme, which sparked outrage on social networks including Twitter focuses on the day-to-day lives of locals living in James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham. Ninety . per cent of residents living in the 137-house street claim one or more . benefits ranging from £500 to £900 a month in free hand-outs.","The teenager had a daughter with 'husband' in October last year .

A 42-year-old Romanian driver was beginning a two-year jail sentence in France last night after British customs officials found 48 UK-bound Albanians inside his tanker lorry. The migrants were attempting to sneak into Britain via the Channel Tunnel but were arrested after a search of the vehicle just before midnight on Tuesday by British border police based at Coquelles. The driver told a judge at a Boulogne court that his boss had ordered him to transport the Albanians to the UK. They were loaded into the truck at a motorway rest area less than an hour from Calais. Stopped: The migrants were attempting to sneak into Britain via the Channel Tunnel but were arrested after a search of the vehicle just before midnight on Tuesday by British border police based at Coquelles . The lorry was confiscated and the driver banned from the North region of France for three years. Gangs of Albanian people smugglers based at Channel ferry ports in France are known to be major players in the lucrative business of smuggling poor migrants to the UK. On Monday, a Spanish truck driver aged 49 and two Albanian smugglers in their 20s appeared in court after five Albanians were found shivering in the back of a refrigerated trailer carrying 17 tons of broccoli. The lorry was about to board a ferry to Portsmouth from the port of Ouistreham. At the hearing the driver told the judge that he had been tempted by an offer of €1000 (£830) per migrant payable on arrival at Portsmouth. He claimed that it was the first time he had carried illegal immigrants but police records showed he had been previously arrested last June at Calais after migrants were found in his lorry. The two people smugglers claimed that they too were ordinary migrants and were intent on starting a new life in Britain. Lorry: At the hearing the driver told the judge that he had been tempted by an offer of £830 per migrant payable on arrival at Portsmouth . But the judge reminded them that they had been arrested together with the driver outside the lorry. 'You didn't hesitate to let the five Albanians travel in a trailer at a temperature of between 0 and 3C’, the judge told them. 'You didn't hesitate to let the five Albanians travel in a trailer at a temperature of between 0 and 3C' Judge . The prosecutor asked the judge to impose 12-month jail sentences on the defendants, saying they had exploited human misery and poor people's hopes for a better life with no regard for their safety. Last autumn deputy mayor at the port of Calais, Philippe Mignonet, called UK immigration policy 'obnoxious and hypocritical' - blaming Britain for attracting migrants and making the port a bottleneck gateway to the UK. Mr Mignonet, who is also the port's immigration chief, revealed in an interview with the Daily Telegraph last month that '40 migrants a day or up to 15,000 a year' manage to evade border controls and sneak over to the UK through Calais. Mr Mignonet called for border controls to be transferred from Calais to Dover, to deal with what is a 'British problem'. Razed: Homeless Afghan and Iraqi migrants began camping out in what was dubbed 'The Jungle' - a massive squat camp near the Calais ferry terminal. Here, it is pictured being invaded by police officers in 2009 . French Interior Minister Valls has called on UK Home Secretary Theresa May to visit Calais to 'see for herself ' the chaos there caused by migrants desperate to stow away on ferries to Britain. Calais became a magnet for UK-bound refugees in the mid-90s following the war in Kosovo. A huge Red Cross refuge at Sangatte was closed in 2002 on the orders of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy after pressure from Britain. Homeless Afghan and Iraqi migrants began camping out in what was dubbed 'The Jungle' - a massive squat camp near the ferry terminal. The Jungle was razed in 2009 again on the orders of Mr Sarkozy after a Canadian journalist was raped. Since then migrants have camped out in sand dunes, Second World War German bunkers and open air squats in Calais. Currently, their numbers are estimated at more than 500.","Driver, 42, was beginning two-year prison sentence in France last night .

Three days out from standing trial for the murder of his wife, a California man accepted a last-minute plea deal for a lesser charge on Friday in realtion to the 2012 overdose death of Beth Risenburg - much to the horror of the victim's family. Jason Risenburg, 38, was charged with giving his 31-year-old wife a lethal dose of the drug methadone on April 2, 2012. The narcotic is usually used to wane addicts off heroin, however Risenburg had been prescribed it as pain relief for a work-related back injury. The Fremont man originally pleaded not guilty to charges of first degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and corrupting another with drugs and, if convicted, faced at least 33 years in prison. Nearly two years after his wife 'unexpectedly died in her sleep', Jason Risenburg (pictured) admitted in court on Friday that he gave her a lethal dose of the drug methadone, which he took to relieve back pain . Victim: Beth Risenburg, 31, died in her sleep on April 2, 2012. Her death was initially not deemed suspicious because he had suffered a string of health problems, however an autopsy eventually proved she had toxic levels of methadone in her system . However with the murder trial set to start Monday, Risenburg pleaded guilty to one charge of involuntary manslaughter on Friday, as part of a deal that the prosecution would drop the murder and drug charges. Risenburg now faces up to 11 years in prison, with sentencing expected in two to three weeks. The victim’s mother, Maureen Spaulding, of Northwood, said she reluctantly consented to the plea agreement on Friday just hours after learning her husband, James, is again suffering from cancer. 'Our hearts wanted to go to trial,' she told The Toledo Blade. 'Our hearts wanted him to get the maximum time for what he did. 'I have a hard time accepting getting 11 years for taking her life. 'I can’t see that as fair. I can’t see that as OK, but at the same time the part of me that knows my daughter knows she would want me focused on her Dad’s health right now. I’m choosing to think it was her influence that made it go this way to make us focus on him. She was always daddy’s little girl.' Three weeks before her death in 2012, Beth Risenburg was taken to a local hospital and found to have methadone in her system. 'He claimed it was an accident — that he had mixed up their two medications and accidentally gave her methadone,' Mrs. Spaulding said. Maureen Spaulding, mother of victim Beth Risenburg, has spoken about the death of her daughter and how the family knew her husband was behind it. Jason Risenburg has now pleaded guilty to manslaughter . Methadone - which is available as a prescription under numerous different names, such as Subutex - is typically used to wane people off heroin. However Jason Risenburg said he had been given it by a doctor to treat back pain following a work injury . 'She had a horrible reaction to it.' The incident didn’t sit right with the Spauldings, but their daughter 'loved him to death and wanted to believe with all her heart' that it had been an accident', her mother said. The two had married in 1999 when Ms. Risenburg was just 18. 'Something had changed in him in the last year. We all saw it. We all knew it,' Mrs. Spaulding said. 'It was hard for Beth to accept, and I think she had finally come to the conclusion that maybe it wasn’t an accident.' The day Ms. Risenburg died, Risenburg called 911 to say his wife wouldn’t wake up. She had a history of health problems, so her death was not immediately suspicious to police and emergency responders. 'I knew what it was immediately,' Mrs Spaulding said. Several weeks after Ms. Risenburg died, the Spauldings took their suspicions to Fremont Police Detective Jason Kiddey, who agreed to look into the claims. 'The family was upset, and my goal was to help them find closure,' Detective Kiddey told The Blade. 'That’s what I truly meant to do, but I didn’t know what I was going to find.' Beth Risenburg, 31, was killed by an overdose of the prescription drug Methadone in April 2012. Her husband has now pleaded guilty to her manslaughter . Not long after he began investigating, toxicology tests performed during the autopsy revealed startling levels of methadone in Ms. Risenburg's system. The investigation was bolstered, Detective Kiddey said, by a 5½-hour interview he conducted with Risenburg, who moved to North Carolina after his wife’s death but agreed to meet with him during a visit to Ohio. 'It was a gamble - Everything on my case hinged on that interview,' Detective Kiddey said. While declining to be specific, Detective Kiddey said Risenburg 'confessed to several different things' during the lengthy interview. Ultimately, Sandusky County Coroner Dr. John Wukie ruled Ms. Risenburg’s death a homicide, and a Sandusky County grand jury indicted Risenburg on the three charges last January. Risenburg has been held in the Sandusky County jail on $1 million bond since he was extradited here from North Carolina last year. 'It’s very difficult because I see the son [in law] I loved for 15 years, but I also see the man who murdered my daughter,' Mrs. Spaulding said. 'It’s incomprehensible. I’m stunned. I’m still stunned.'","Beth Risenburg, 31, died in her sleep on April 2, 2012 .

One of the victims named in recent indictment against two ‘revenge porn’ kingpins has opened up about her struggles after a topless picture of her was put online. Kayla Laws, 25, of Studio City, CA, is one of eight accusers against Hunter Moore and Charlie Evans after discovering she was featured on their IsAnyOneUp.com website. She spoke out this week after the two men were indicted in California for running the site, which has since been taken over by an anti-bullying group. Devastated: Kayla Laws said she felt betrayed, and that finding her picture on the site hit her 'like a ton of bricks' ‘You think that it can't happen to you, but it can,’ she said in an interview with KNBC. ‘I was just so damaged by it. I just wanted to stay in my room. It just all hit me like a ton of bricks.’ The ‘it’ she refers to is a picture of hers revealing one breast that was uploaded to the site in October 2011, it took nine days to get the picture removed – but it had also been mass-texted to almost everyone, she recalled. ‘They would message me saying, ‘Hey, you look good, baby.’ She has been on a crusade to find justice ever since, and has been joined by her mother dubbed ‘The Erin Brockovich of revenge porn.’ 'The Erin Brockovich of revenge porn': Charlotte Laws helped her daughter push new legistlation into law making the sites illegal in California . ‘I'm so happy that, finally, something's happening,’ Charlotte Laws told the station. ‘Revenge porn can be anything. It's really just about hurting and humiliating people and trying to ruin their lives.’ Daughter Kayla will have to ‘monitor the Internet for the rest of her life,’ she added. Moore and Evens were charged Thursday several counts accusing them of hacking into people’s computers and email accounts, taking images and posting them online without permission. Kayla Laws’ picture was stolen from her email, she found out about the betrayal from a friend. ‘You are topless on a website. It is called isanyoneup.com,’ Charlotte Laws recalled her daughter telling her in a post on XOJane. The aspiring actress was devastated, crying – she had never given the pictures to anyone, she said. Accused founder: Hunter Moore, called 'the most hated man on the internet' by Rolling Stone, is accused of running the revenge porn website . Requests to take down the picture were rebuffed by Moore, Charlotte Laws wrote, so she and her daughter began ‘Operation No Moore.’ Validation of their campaigning came when a bill was signed into law late last year that makes revenge porn a crime in the state. The two men were arrested this week and each charged with conspiracy, seven counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, records showed. Both men face a mandatory two year sentence if convicted of identity theft, and five years for each of the other charges if found guilty. The trial is expected to start later this year.","Kayla Laws said she discovered her pictures on IsAnyOneUp.com in October 2011 .

A study has identified a mechanism through which the food poisoning bug reduces the lung disease in mice. Earlier research has suggested children who have been infected with salmonella are less likely to get asthma. Asthma could be treated with probiotics that mimic the salmonella bug, new research suggests . A leading theory is the 'hygiene hypothesis' that reasons the surge in asthma cases has resulted from the modern world's obsession with cleanliness, which is leaving immune systems undeveloped. Dr Venkateswaran Ganesh, of Hanover Medical School in Germany, said the latest study found salmonella infection was linked with reduced airway inflammation. The findings, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, open up new avenues of research that could lead to treatments. Dr Ganesh traced the improvement to reduced production of an inflammatory compound called interleukin 4 which is produced by an immune cell known as T helper-2. He found an increase in a certain type of 'myeloid' immune cell was responsible for regulating the T helper-2 cells to produce less interleukin-4. Myeloid cells include an array of immune cells and are ultimately derived from the bone marrow. Salmonella (pictured) infection is linked to reduced airway inflammation . The research could lead to probiotic asthma treatments based on the use of the body's harmless bacteria resembling Salmonella, or the application of myeloid cells as therapeutics, said Dr Ganesh. In the UK 5.4 million people are treated for asthma, or one in 11 children and one in 12 adults. On average, three people a day die from the condition. An estimated 75 per cent of hospital admissions for asthma are avoidable and 90 per cent of deaths preventable. It is more common in women than men. The NHS spends around Â£1 billion a year treating and caring for people with asthma.","Children who have had salmonella are less likely to develop asthma .

Bankrupt and traumatised: Paul and Sandra Dunham are contemplating life in separate prisons in the US . A British couple who are the latest targets of the controversial extradition treaty with the US face dying behind bars – in a dispute over work expenses. Paul Dunham, 58, and his wife Sandra, 57, say they will consider ending their lives rather than spending years in an American prison segregated from each other. The couple, who have one son and five grandchildren, were arrested at their four-bedroom detached house in Northampton 14 months ago and are set to be extradited within weeks. They are being treated as criminals under the Extradition Act, despite campaigners saying the row is a civil matter. The couple – who are backed by the mother of computer hacker Gary McKinnon – expect to spend the next couple of years in a US prison for offences they insist they did not commit. As they wait for the case to be heard, the pair – who have been married for 35 years – will not be allowed to see each other. Speaking for the first time about the case, Mr Dunham last night told the Mail: ‘Once we are separated and incarcerated, to us, the point of life will be over.’ His wife added: ‘This has completely destroyed our lives. It is like a horror movie.’ Mr Dunham ran the UK arm of an American soldering iron manufacturer PACE, while his wife worked in sales at the company. After 25 years of service, they were asked to move to the US to take charge of the firm in 2005. Owner William Siegel promoted Mr Dunham to chief executive after removing his son Eric from the business, but in May 2009, after Mr Siegel had a reconciliation with Eric and brought him back into the business, the couple resigned and returned to the UK. Eric Siegel now claims that between 2002 and 2009, the couple embezzled more than $1million (£610,000) in expense claims that were not legitimate. In December 2011, Mr Dunham was indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money laundering by a grand jury in Greenbelt, Maryland, and faces a jail sentence of 340 years. Threat: A British magistrates' court ruled in July that their extradition to face a US prison could proceed . His wife was indicted on eight counts of fraud with a possible sentence of 240 years. They had no chance to defend themselves and, incredibly, had no idea the grand jury had even met until police arrived at their home in November 2012. A British magistrates’ court ruled in July that the extradition could proceed. An appeal hearing at the High Court on February 6 will decide if the couple can be detained and forced to return to the US within weeks. Their trial might not start for years but they will likely be deemed a ‘flight risk’ and be denied bail. Angry: Janis Sharp, mother of Gary McKinnon, who was saved from extradition, said it breaks her heart to hear the Dunhams' story . The couple have already been made bankrupt because of a related civil claim. They are surviving on £16 a week in tax credits and the wages from Mrs Dunham’s part-time job in accounts. The couple say the allegations against them are ‘without merit’. Mr Dunham said: ‘We do not want to end our lives. Nothing would give us greater satisfaction than to get back on our feet and get somewhere close to where we used to be. But once we are incarcerated that is a real possibility as we are not going to have each other. ‘If we get put on that plane and taken to the US, we are going to lose this house and everything in it as there will be no way of paying the mortgage or the bills. ‘We are going to lose our dogs. My father is 84. A year or two years later what are we going to come back to? Nothing. Sixty years of age and homeless. That is not a life I want to consider living.’ Opponents of the extradition treaty say it is lopsided, with seven times as many Britons being sent to the US as have travelled in the opposite direction. Janis Sharp, mother of Gary McKinnon, who was saved from extradition after a Mail campaign, said: ‘My heart breaks to learn of the terror that another family is going through as a result of the UK’s cruel extradition legislation.’ Melanie Riley, of campaign group Friends Extradited, said: ‘How many more lives have to be utterly destroyed before the British Government realises that all campaigners are calling for is a more humane extradition system?’","Paul Dunham, 58, and wife Sandra, 57, say they will consider ending their lives .

"By . Reuters . PUBLISHED: . 22:36 EST, 24 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 00:42 EST, 25 January 2014 . The U.S. Supreme Court said on Friday that, while litigation continues, an order of Roman Catholic nuns need not comply with a part of President Barack Obama's healthcare law requiring employers to provide insurance that covers contraception. In the latest skirmish over religious objections to providing government-mandated contraception, the four-sentence court order was a partial victory for the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Baltimore-based order of nuns that runs nursing homes, and Illinois-based Christian Brothers Services, which manages healthcare plans for Catholic groups. The unusually worded order by the court did impose a requirement on the groups before they can claim the exemption. First, they must send written notification to the Department of Health and Human Services saying they object to the contraception mandate. A group of Roman Catholic nuns in Baltimore (not pictured here) don't need to provide medical insurance that covers contraception for employers as long as litigation over whether or not they must provide the insurance continues . Obama's healthcare plan requires employers to provide insurance coverage that includes contraceptive coverage to employees . The court's decision means that, as long as the groups send the letters, they are effectively exempt while litigation continues in lower courts, putting off for now any conclusive decision on this latest legal test of Obamacare, as the president's 2010 Affordable Care Act has become known. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the groups, hailed the court's order as a victory. 'We are delighted that the Supreme Court has issued this order protecting the Little Sisters, attorney Mark Rienzi said in a statement. 'The government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people - it doesn't need to force nuns to participate.' The U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which supports the mandate, said in a statement that the case focused only on the way that groups like the Little Sisters can claim an exemption. 'This is a case about paperwork, not religious liberty,' she said. Dozens of other Catholic groups are involved in similar litigation across the country. Most have already won temporary injunctions. So far, no federal appeals court has ruled on the merits of the groups' claims, according to the Becket Fund. A Planned Parenthood spokesperson said that the case is about 'paperwork' and about how groups claim exemption from providing contraceptive coverage . The organizations accuse the federal government of forcing them to support contraception and sterilization in violation of their religious beliefs, or face steep fines. The Little Sisters lawsuit was filed also on behalf of hundreds of other groups that obtain benefits via Christian Brothers Services, although that has not been certified as a class-action at this stage. The Becket Fund say they would also benefit from the court's order. The unsigned Supreme Court order said it 'should not be construed as an expression of the court's views on the merits.' The Obamacare law requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women, including contraception and sterilization. The act makes an exception for religious institutions such as houses of worship that mainly serve and employ members of their own faith, but not for schools, hospitals and charitable organizations that employ people of all faiths. As a compromise, the administration agreed to an accommodation for non-profits affiliated with religious entities that was finalized in July. But the Little Sisters and other Catholic groups said the compromise process still violated their religious rights. In court filings, the government had conceded it could not enforce the mandate against the Little Sisters in any case because of the nature of their health-care plan. A federal judge in Colorado, William Martinez, denied the plaintiffs' request for an injunction on Dec 27. The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals followed suit on December 31, prompting a last-minute plea to the Supreme Court. Although Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a temporary injunction on December 31, the court then spent more than three weeks weighing how to proceed. In separate cases, the Supreme Court has already agreed to hear oral arguments in March on whether for-profit corporations can object to the contraception mandate on religious grounds.","Religious groups can claim exemption from providing contraceptive insurance by sending a written notification to the Department of Health saying they object to the contraception mandate .

Schumacher had been at the hospital since December 19, a day after 14-year-old Gunnar ‘sonny’ Schumacher and 49-year-old Ludwig Schumacher were found dead in an Essex apartment. Free at last: Christina Schumacher, 48, was ordered released from a Vermont psychiatric ward more than five weeks after she was hospitalized against her will in the wake of her husband and son's murder-suicide . Murder-suicide: On December 18, Gunnar Schumacher, 14 (left), was found strangled to death in his family home at the hands of his father, 48-year-old Ludwig Schumacher (right), who committed suicide by hanging . Committed: Christina Schumacher had been at Fletcher Allen Health Care in Burlington for more than a month . Police said the father, a former Vermont National Guardsman and F-16 pilot, strangled the high school freshman before he hanged himself. It was unclear whether Schumacher had left the facility by Friday night. Griffin said in his ruling that he disagreed with a doctor's assessment before Schumacher arrived for a regular appointment the day after the murder-suicide that she needed to admit herself or be taken into custody. ‘The court did not find, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent was a person in need of treatment at the time of admission or application, nor a patient in need of further treatment at the time of the hearing,’ Griffin wrote in his ruling.

The Burlington Free Press reported that according to court records, Schumacher indicated to her sister after the couple separated last summer that she would kill herself if anything happened to her two children. ‘I am not ill; I am simply a mother who is grieving the tragic loss of her young son,"" Schumacher told the Burlington Free Press this week. ‘No mother should ever have to experience this loss.’ Schumacher told the newspaper that she and her insurance company had been billed for the unwanted treatment. Mike Noble, a spokesman for the hospital, said that he can't speak to the specifics of the case but ‘that in all matters such as this we make decisions that we think are in the best interests of the patient.’ Schumacher had warned police that she feared for her son's safety hours before the bodies were found, according to court papers. She told Essex police the night before the murder-suicide that she feared Ludwig Schumacher might try to take the teenager out of the country, according to court papers. Broken family: Christina and Ludwig separated last summer after 19 years of marriage . Father-son drama: Mrs Schumacher wrote in a complaint in July that her husband flipped a table over their son and then overturned a table in a fit of anger . Ludwig Schumacher was a former member of the Vermont National Guard and state Republican campaign official. Police said he left a typed suicide note in the apartment detailing the motive behind the killing, the station WCAX reported. On December 18, Ludwig Schumacher, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Vermont National Guard, called Essex High School asking to excuse his son from class to attend to a family situation. At around 2pm that day, police responded to a 911 call placed by Gunnar Schumacher’s friend reporting a suicide. Officers who arrived at the Schumachers' apartment at 8 Carmichael Street in Essex Junction discovered the bodies of the 14-year-old boy and his father. According to investigators, the high school student died from strangulation at the hands of his father, who then took his own life by hanging himself.

Remy now lives with the nuns at Sisters of Our Lady of Christian Doctrine. Artope said that the sisters didn't have to pay for the adoption - Pauline Jarney, a Hi Tor volunteer, and Roberta Bangs, a Hi Tor board member, were so moved by the nuns' actions that they covered the bill.

Six men were shot dead in western Pakistan while protecting a Spanish man travelling through the country by bike, police said. Javier Colorado, who is attempting to cycle around the world, had crossed into Pakistan's western province of Baluchistan from Iran. Although police reported that he suffered minor injuries, his family posted on his Facebook page that he was unhurt. Scroll down for video . Dangerous ride: Cyclist Javier Colorado was being escorted through a violent area of Pakistan when the escort was attacked and all six guards were shot dead . Mr Colorado arrived in the town of Dalbandin, about 220 miles from Quetta, provincial capital of Baluchistan, on Tuesday evening after biking from the Iranian border, said the provincial Home Secretary, Asadur Rehman Gilani. Local authorities asked him to stay overnight out of concern for his safety and then arranged a police escort of more than a dozen officers to take him to Quetta on Wednesday morning, Gilani said. When they were in the Mastung district, about 45 miles from Quetta, unidentified gunmen opened fire. The attack came one day after a bus bomb killed 28 Shi'ite . pilgrims in the same area, and police believe the attack was carried out by the same ground . Six policemen were killed, while Mr Colorado and another nine police officers were wounded, according to police official Mohammed Ibrahim. Contrasting stories: Pakistani police reported that Colorado was hurt in the attack, however his family were told he was not injured . He was assigned the escort by security . forces because the province is plagued by kidnappers, Taliban . militants, a violent separatist insurgency, sectarian killers, . paramilitary death squads and drug traffickers. According . to Mr Colorado's Facebook page, he was planning to cycle around the . world. Early on Wednesday, he posted ‘Adios Iran, Hola Pakistan’ on his . page. Mr Colorado's family also posted a message on his Facebook several hours after the attack: . ‘This . is a message from Javier Colorado's family. In the first place we want . to thank the Spanish consulate in Pakistan for all their help. 'We've . received a call from the embassy and they have informed us that Javier . is well and not hurt. Today he will fly to Lahore, on the border with . India. His initial intent is to continue his trip.’ Police said they did not know why Mr Colorado had chosen to cycle through such a dangerous area. World-wide mission: Mr Colorado is attempting to cycle around the world, and blogs about his journey on Facebook . In a statement, the Spanish Foreign Ministry reached out to Pakistan over the death of Colorado's guards. ‘The . government of Spain wants to transmit to Pakistani authorities its . profound concern and grief’ over the deaths, said the statement. Two young Czech women taking the same route by bus were kidnapped in March and are still being held. Shafqat Anwar Shawani, the assistant police commissioner for Mastung district, said six security men and one attacker were killed on Wednesday. In the same district on Tuesday, a bomb targeting a bus killed 28 Shi'ite pilgrims, many of them women and children. Such sectarian attacks are increasingly common in Pakistan, where Shi'ites make up 20 percent of the 180 million people. On Wednesday, hundreds of Shi'ites protested against the bus bombing by sitting in the road alongside the bodies of the dead in the provincial capital of Quetta. The community held similar protests demanding protection after bombings in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, killed around 200 people, mostly Shi'ites, last year.","Six guards shot dead escorting Spanish cyclist Javier Colorado in Pakistan .

Nelson Mandela is unresponsive and his immediate family is now discussing whether to withdraw treatment, it has been claimed. The 94-year-old has been in hospital for two weeks battling a recurring lung infection, but previous statements have indicated that Mr Mandela’s health is improving. According to a new source, Mr Mandela’s liver and kidney functions are down to 50 per cent and he has not opened his eyes for days. Scroll down for video . South African authorities have announced that former president Nelson Mandela is in a 'critical condition'. He has been in hospital fighting a recurring lung infection . He has also had two recent procedures, one to repair a bleeding ulcer and another to insert a tube into his body, CBS News reports. This information indicates that Mr Mandela’s situation is much more much more serious than has been reported by South African authorities. In an interview last week, South African president Jacob Zuma said Mr Mandela was responding better to treatment. Marking the 49th anniversary of the sentencing of the former president to life in prison in 1964, last Wednesday Mr Zuma said: ‘We are very happy with the progress that he is now making following a difficult last few days.’ Following the interview with the ANC leader, a government spokesman told local radio that Mr Mandela remained in a 'serious but stable' condition. South African President Jacob Zuma, pictured with Mr Mandela in April, said: 'Madiba is well-looked after and is comfortable. He is in good hands' As recent as Thursday, one of Nelson Mandela’s grandsons said he hoped Mandela would be discharged shortly as his health was improving. ‘Positively we can say that he has been getting better and better each day and hopefully he'll be coming home soon,’ Ndaba Mandela told South African newspaper The Star. However, details about the night Mr Mandela arrived in hospital two weeks ago have emerged. According to CBS News, Mr Mandela went into cardiac arrest the night he was taken to Pretoria Hospital and had to be resuscitated. As Mr Mandela was driven to the hospital the ambulance suffered an engine failure and was forced to wait for over 40 minutes for a replacement. Family worries: Winnie and Zindzi Mandela, ex-wife and daughter of Nelson Mandela, pictured with an unidentified man at the hospital last week, are said to be discussing whether to continue the 94-year-old's treatments . When the second ambulance arrived Mr Mandela had to be transferred - in winter temperatures- to a second vehicle which could have had an impact on his condition, according to a cardiologist interviewed by CBS. South African government officials have said ‘great care was taken to ensure that Mandela's health was not compromised and that his doctors were satisfied the former president suffered no harm.’ Mandela, who turns 95 next month, is being treated at a Pretoria hospital for a recurring lung infection. The hospital stay is his fourth since December and there is a growing realisation among South Africa's 53million people that they will one day have to say goodbye to the father of the 'Rainbow Nation' that Mandela tried to forge from the ashes of apartheid.","Nelson Mandela allegedly 'unresponsive for days' at Pretoria hospital .

Britain could agree to accept hundreds of refugees from camps in and around Syria, following pressure from the Liberal Democrats. David Cameron is facing calls from Nick Clegg to drop his opposition to the idea of giving sanctuary to some of the 2.3 million people displaced in the bloody conflict. The Lib Dems want Britain to sign up to the United Nations appeal for Western countries to accept 30,000 of those trapped in the region. Help: Britain has so far refused to sign up to the United Nations refugee programme to provide sanctuary to 30,000 people trapped in Syria although Cameron said he was ready to take in some of the most vulnerable . In a sign that Mr Cameron’s position was shifting, he told the Commons yesterday that he was ready to take in some of the most vulnerable refugees from camps in and around Syria. But he stopped short of agreeing to take part in the UN scheme. France has agreed to take 500 refugees and Germany has accepted 1,000 with a promise of admitting another 9,000. The move comes as fears grow that peace talks are close to collapse after a furious clash over President Assad’s future. Amid hostile exchanges in Switzerland, Syria’s government ridiculed demands by opposition leaders and their Western backers including Britain for Assad to stand down, saying it would never happen. With renewed fighting in large parts of Syria, the opposition insisted the country’s leader lost his legitimacy when he crushed a once-peaceful protest movement. But foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said it was terrorists and foreign meddling that had ripped his country apart. Now Mr Clegg and his senior Cabinet colleagues are pushing for Britain to do more to help the millions of people caught up in the conflict. It comes after Ukip leader Nigel Farage called for Britain to start admitting Syrian refugees, arguing ‘there is a responsibility on all of us in the free west’, although he later rowed back after am outcry from Ukip members. A Lib Dem minister told MailOnline: ‘Nigel Farage was absolutely right. Britain should be doing the right thing and providing help to these people who are just desperate.’ Mr Cameron insists Britain is leading the world in delivering aid and was meeting its obligations to asylum seekers, but he has rebuffed calls from Mr Clegg to sign up the United Nations refugee quota scheme. Opinions: David Cameron has set himself against signing up to the UN scheme but Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is urging him to do more to help people in the region . A Lib Dem source told The Times: ‘We . are one of the most open-hearted countries in the world and Nick . believes we have a moral responsibility to help. ‘The . coalition Government has been the most generous in the world when it . comes to helping with the humanitarian crisis in Syria and it would be . self-defeating to allow ourselves to be painted as the least generous. ‘The .

Labour leader Ed Miliband is to force a vote in the House of Commons next week on allowing Syrian refugees into Britain . Mr Cameron's official spokesman today declined to give any timetable or estimate of numbers of Syrian refugees facing extreme hardship who might be admitted. The spokesman said: 'What the Government is doing is looking at how we can help the most vulnerable cases of extreme hardship.' But Labour insists that this was not enough to respond to the scale of MPs' concerns, and announced it would stage an opposition day vote next Wednesday calling for Britain to sign up to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees appeal for Western countries to accept 30,000 of those trapped in the region. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'Britain cannot be seen to turn its back on the most vulnerable Syrian refugees who will struggle to survive or cope in the camps, and must support the UN urgently. 'The Government response on the UN programme for vulnerable Syrian refugees is completely inadequate - as Tory and Liberal backbenchers and even the Deputy Prime Minister have now accepted.' Anna Musgrave from the Refugee Council said: 'The UNHCR has long been calling on the UK to offer safe haven to those who will struggle to survive in the region.

A terrifying video has surfaced showing teenagers riding on the outside of a train as it crosses the Williamsburg bridge that links Brooklyn with Manhattan. A growing numbers of teenagers in search of Internet fame are risking their lives by performing dangerous stunts on the New York City subway in what is becoming an alarming online trend. YouTube is filled with clips of young men in their teens and early 20s jumping across the tracks, playing chicken with trains and 'surfing' on moving trains. The growing number of recordings and images posted online showing the underground acts of daring has left New York City officials calling for a crackdown on thrill-seekers. Scroll down for video... I believe I can fly: The foolish teenager lifts both his feet off the floor as the J train hurtles across the Williamsburg Bridge . Crazy: Subway surfing is the most x-treme NYC sport, the ultimate x-pression of rebellion in a world run amok . Hold on: The surfer clings on as the train hurtles through the subway tunnels . Difference: The subway surfers are given a unique perspective into the subway system from the outside of the trains . Train traffic ahead: In the video it looks as though this train was on-coming, but the film was played in reverse. Still, it is too close for comfort for the majority . The teenagers subway surf on a J train over the Williamsburg Bridge. In this latest video, the participants believe they are taking part in some kind of extreme sport - the ultimate expression of rebellion. No thought is given to the fact that their actions not only cause massive delays for fellow strap-hangers but the risk of serious injury or death does not even occur. Why don't you take the J train? The J train crosses the Williamsburg bridge on the top level of the bridge from where there are spectacular views - but you don't need to be on the outside of the train to enjoy them! Mind the gap: The ledge on which the subway surfer stand isn't even wide enough to hold their foot . Precarious perch: Just one false move, and it's all over. Surely? Walloped: There were 53 subway-related deaths last year - but 151 people were hit by trains . Down time: The subway surfing took place in the middle of the night when there were very few passengers on board the Williamsburg bridge was eerily quiet . Risk: Subway surfing causes massive delays for fellow strap-hangers and of course risk serious injury or death . The video was filmed with the riders hanging on at the rear of the train and then played in reverse once it was posted online. It gives the appearance that the riders are at the front of the train as it hurtles through the subway system. At one point, the surfer lifts both of his legs in the air and clings on to the rear of the train and it crosses the bridge. A few minutes later the young mans feet are seen on the precariously thin ledge at the very rear of the subway car holding on with just one hand. Easy rider: The young man shown in this viral YouTube video 'surfing' a New York City subway is only one of a large community of thrill-seekers who perform risky stunts underground . Leap of faith: One of the most popular feats among teenage daredevils is jumping across the subway tracks . Enough is enough: The MTA has called for a crackdown on people bent on putting their lives at risk and threatening the safety of others . The Metropolitan Transportation Agency that oversees the sprawling New York City subway system has called the stunts 'exceedingly stupid' and 'extremely dangerous,' urging the public: 'Donâ€™t do it.' There were 53 subway-related deaths in New York City last year. Even those instances of risky subway feats that do not end in tragedy are stomach-churning to watch.

Southern Australia is in the grip of a widespread heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 40C in many areas causing hundreds of bushfires, thousands of lightning storms, and leaving players and ball boys collapsing on court at the Australian Open. One woman was hospitalised after bushfires broke out in two states, and players at the Australian Open in Melbourne have complained of “inhumane” conditions after one hallucinated that he saw Snoopy mid-match, a ball boy fainted, one player vomited, and drink bottles melted on court where the mercury tipped 42.8C yesterday. Canadian qualifier Frank Dancevic hallucinated then fainted during his first-round match to Frenchman Benoit Paire. He was unconscious for almost a minute but returned to the court before losing the match. Scroll down for video . Cooling down: Police officers take their horses for an early morning swim at Semaphore beach, in Adelaide, where temperatures have reached as high as 45C . Bath-tiime over: The horses are ridden back to their stables for another hot and very humid day . ‘I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, 'Wow Snoopy, that's weird,’ Dancevic said. ‘I couldn't keep my balance anymore and I leaned over the fence and when I woke up people were all around me.’ Britain's Andy Murray said Australian Open organisers were risking a tragedy by allowing the competition to continue in such extreme temperatures. ‘As much as it's easy to say the conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen,’ Murray said. ‘And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. That's not great. ‘Whether it's safe or not, I don't know. There's been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks.’ Former women's world No.1 Caroline Wozniacki said the bottom of her water bottle started melting when she placed it on the court. ‘It feels like I was sweating in a sauna or something,’ Wozniacki said.

Baking hot: Even these parasol hats couldn't protect spectators from the extreme heat as they sat watching a match between Germany's Sabine Lisicki and Monica Niculescu of Romania . Tournament organisers said while conditions were hot and uncomfortable, there was no need to invoke the extreme weather policy. 'The relatively low level of humidity ensured that conditions never deteriorated to a point where we needed to invoke the extreme heat policy,' Australian Open tournament referee Wayne McKewen said yesterday. Temperatures have soared in Victoria, South Australia and southern New South Wales over recent days and relief is unlikely to come until the end of the week. Sydney and Perth have been spared the worst of the conditions this week, but Melbourne and Adelaide are suffering from prolonged highs of up to 45C. Fire bans are in place in Victoria and South Australia where the country town of Keith sweltered under a high of 47C yesterday. This week is set to be the hottest on record for Adelaide, which today faces a maximum of 45C, and tomorrow is set to reach 46C, with weather forecasters predicting the city’s temperature records could be broken. The Adelaide record of 46.1C was set on January 12, 1939. Adding to the nightmare, the heat also brought thunderstorms that sparked bushfires across South Australia, which was hit by some 26,000 lightning strikes yesterday. A 49-year-old woman was hospitalised with burns and smoke inhalation after she was injured when a fire destroyed her home at Rockleigh, near Monarto Zoo, south-east of Adelaide, and burned through an estimated 4500ha of scrub. A total fire ban remains in place in Victoria, where crews are bracing for horror conditions on Friday that are the worst the state has been faced with since the deadly Black Saturday blazes in 2009. A possum emerges from hiding in Stoneville, Perth, after the fire reduced much of its habitat to ashes: Unfortunately the animal had to be put down as it had been so badly burned . Path of destruction: Nearby is one of the properties that was damaged before firefighters could put out the blaze . At least 250 separate blazes continued to burn overnight, including one which destroyed a country café on the picturesque Mornington Peninsula. It was an uncomfortable night’s sleep for many in Melbourne as the mercury hovered in the mid-30s, making it the second-hottest night on record. Many flocked to the beach to try and get some relief from the heat. It is forecast to rise to 42 again in Melbourne today. Acting Victorian Premier Peter Ryan warned conditions were some of the worst Victoria has faced in recent years and urged people to take care in the coming days. ‘These next four days promise to be amongst the most significant we have faced in Victoria since Black Saturday (in 2009),’ he said. Fire Services commissioner Craig Lapsley said Victoria is not as dry as it was in 2009, but warned that Friday ‘is the peak danger day in Victoria this week’. While Western Australia has been spared the high temperatures this week, a bushfire destroyed 52 homes when it raged through Perth Hills on Sunday. The blaze started in Parkerville before spreading to Stoneville and burning through almost 400 hectares. This week’s soaring temperatures came as the national weather bureau launched a new heatwave forecast service and released the first official definition of a heatwave:  three or more days of unusually high maximum and minimum temperatures in any area. Heatwaves have taken more Australian lives than any other natural hazard in the past 200 years, according to the weather bureau. Assistant Director for Weather Services, Alasdair Hainsworth, warned the prolonged high temperatures posed serious health risks. ‘Severe and extreme heatwaves pose significant risks to human health and safety, in particular for the elderly, who are more vulnerable to the effects of heat stress,’ he said.

Video shows the plane as it hit the runway and flipped up into the air before somersaulting along the runway . Meanwhilst, the captain of the plane has confessed to investigators he felt stressed out and was 'very concerned' about attempting a manual visual approach because the runway's automatic warning systems were out of service due to construction. Lee Kang Kuk, a 46-year-old pilot who was landing the big jet for his first time at San Francisco, stated 'it was very difficult to perform a visual approach with a heavy airplane.' Scroll down for video... New perspective: The National Transportation Safety Board released a new video of the crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 in San Francisco this summer . Flipped: Filmed from an airport camera, it shows the Boeing 777 coming in for landing. The jet's tail strikes the ground, and the whole aircraft pitches up into the air . Deadly impact: Three people were killed and more than 180 injured in the accident, on July 6. At a hearing about the crash today, the NTSB released documents showing that the pilots knew their speed was too low as they approached the ground . An aerial view of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 plane is seen after it crashed while landing at San Francisco International Airport in California in July . Hearing: National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chair Deborah Hersman, center, takes her seat next to NTSB member Robert Sumwalt, right, during an NTSB investigative hearing in Washington . Experts: Retired Capt. John Cashman, a former Boeing 777 chief pilot, center, looks over documents with other Boeing personnel before the NTSB investigative hearing on the crash landing of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 . The jet crash landed after approaching low and slow in an accident that left three dead and more than 150 injured. The report was released at the start of a daylong National Transportation Safety Board hearing into the accident. 'In this hearing, we will learn about . the facts of the crash, but we will also learn about the factors that . enabled so many to walk away. We will focus not only on the human . machine interface in highly automated aircraft, but also on emergency . response,' said NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman, opening the hearing. The . trainee captain told investigators that he realized others had been . landing at San Francisco without the glide slope indicator, a technology . that helps pilots land at the airport. That system was out of service . while the runway was expanded, and has since been restarted. Interviews . with the pilots who were in the cockpit indicated a nervous trainee . captain, while the other two pilots recognized too late they were coming . in too low and slow. When asked if he was concerned about his ability to perform the visual approach, Lee said 'very concerned, yea.' The plane struck a seawall just short of the runway, shearing off its tail and sending the rest of the airliner sliding and turning down the runway before breaking apart and catching fire . Korean contingent: Tae-hwan Cho, chairman of the Korean Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board, listens to testimony. The two-dozen witnesses at the hearing include representatives of Asiana, Boeing and the FAA and Korean representatives . A . former Boeing 777 foreign captain at Asiana told investigators he found . it 'extremely difficult' to get pilots to fly visual approaches, and . that they usually wanted to take off rather than land. In clear weather, . it's not unusual for pilots to make a visual approach, using the view . through their windshield. Experts carrying out the . investigation into the Asiana Airlines jet incident want to know how the . three seasoned pilots allowed a passenger jet with no apparent . mechanical problems in near-perfect weather conditions to lose speed so . dramatically that it was on the brink of stalling moments before the . crash. The pilot flying the plane was attempting to land without use of the autopilot. Normally, . the pilot in the second seat is supposed to have his eyes on the . plane's computer screens to monitor airspeed and other readings, rather . than looking out the window. In this case, that pilot was a training captain who was grading the performance of the pilot flying the plane. The . training captain told investigators he thought the plane's autothrottle . was maintaining engine power and thus speed, but discovered that wasn't . the case just moments before the crash. The . autothrottle was 'armed,' or made ready for activation, investigators . said in briefings after the accident, but they left open the question . whether it was engaged and in idle or another mode. Aircraft systems can have many modes, or settings, and perform quite differently depending upon the mode. Investigation: The wrecked Flight 214 on the runway at San Francisco airport .

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will warn Alex Salmond that a proposed currency union with the UK if his nation votes for independence may not be viable . The head of the Bank of England will this week warn Alex Salmond about the dangers of a separate Scotland keeping the pound. Bank Governor Mark Carney is expected to compare the ‘currency union’ between the rest of the UK and an independent Scotland proposed by the SNP to the crisis-hit Eurozone when he meets the First Minister for the first time later this week. If he secures a yes vote in September’s referendum, Mr Salmond claims Scotland could keep the pound, with the Bank of England continuing to represent Scots and make key decisions on issues like interest rates. But it has emerged that the Canadian bank chief has major concerns about whether formal currency-sharing unions can ever work between countries. And he has confirmed that he intends to raise these concerns when he meets the SNP leader and delivers a major speech in Edinburgh on Wednesday. In a interview recorded last week, Mr Carney warned of ‘issues’ with currency unions which have already been seen in Europe. In a clear reference to the troubles of crisis-hit countries like Greece and Cyprus, he also warned of the ‘challenges of having a currency union without certain institutional structures’. It is a significant intervention from Mr Carney, who has not previously discussed the issue of Scottish independence in detail. When asked if an independent Scotland could keep the pound, he said: ‘Well, there are issues with respect to currency unions. We’ve seen them in Europe. ‘It’s one of the factors that affects the outlook for the UK economy, has affected us over the last five years, affects us going forward - the challenges of having a currency union without certain institutional structures. Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond has previously claimed that his country could keep the pound, with the Bank of England continuing to represent Scots and make key decisions on issues like interest rates. ‘I’m actually going to speak to this issue in Scotland next week and I’m certainly going to meet with the First Minister prior to doing so.’ The comments come after senior members of the UK Government warned that it was ‘unlikely’ that the rest of the UK would agree to a pound-sharing union after independence. Although he is unlikely to completely rule out the possibility of a pound-sharing union in Scotland, Mr Carney is expected to raise his concerns about how it would work in a private meeting with Mr Salmond on Wednesday, before he delivers a speech to the Scottish Council for Development and Industry in Edinburgh. However, when asked if he would look forward to managing a shared currency with an independent Scotland, he insisted the he and his colleagues ‘would implement whatever remit we were given’. A UK Government source said: ‘It is significant that Mr Carney has outlined the comparison that others have been making. 'We have been saying for some time that a formal currency union on the UK pound is highly unlikely.  More and more individual voices are now saying why that is so.’ Mr Carney is expected to warn that the new union could be plagued by the same problems that have threatened the crisis-hit Euro . In a further blow to the SNP, a former chief manager at the Bank of England has also warned that a deal on a currency union ‘is not in Alex Salmond’s power’ – and that English voters could demand that a deal is blocked. John Nugée, who has also worked in senior roles at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the European Investment Bank, said that a currency union would mean that the rest of the UK would have to give up some of its decision-making power on economic issues – which he said it was ‘conspicuously unwilling to do with its EU partners’. In an article published today, he said it is ‘almost certainly in Scotland’s interests’ to reach an agreement with the rest of the UK to share the pound, but went on: ‘It is not in Alex Salmond’s power to do so single-handedly. 'It requires the agreement and consent of the continuing UK government, and it is nothing like as clear that - viewed from England, Wales and Northern Ireland - a common monetary area with an independent Scotland is desirable.’ He warned that the rest of the UK may not be willing to give up some of its economic power to a separate Scotland and may not be willing to accept the risk of having to ‘bear the lion’s share of any financial bail-outs’. And he also warned of a backlash from English voters after a yes vote, who may demand that there is ‘no hanging on to the best bits of the Union’. A poll on Scottish independence will be held on September 18 this year, and if successful Scottish independence day is planned for March 2016 . Mr Nugée said: ‘At the moment, it suits the nationalists not to allow voice from elsewhere in the UK too much of a platform. 'But if Scotland votes yes, they will have to allow the rest of the UK to speak, because you cannot negotiate with someone to whom you do not allow a voice. ‘And if the nationalists will have to talk to the rest of the UK after a yes vote, it might be advisable to know what they are thinking and listen to what they are saying before it.’ The Better Together campaign is also today publishing the views of 50 experts who have raised doubts about a currency union. Campaign leader Alistair Darling said: ‘The choice we face is clear - believe Alex Salmond or believe the experts and the facts.’ A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘The Scottish Government has put forward sensible proposals for a formal monetary union that would ensure both governments had full flexibility over their fiscal policies, within an overall sustainable framework.’","Mark Carney will speak to Alex Salmond before a speech in Edinburgh .

The makers of a commercial for Vodafone Egypt are being investigated after a little-known rapper claimed the advert included coded signals for bomb attacks by the Muslim Brotherhood. Egyptian state security prosecutors said they have launched an investigation following a complaint by 25 year-old rapper Ahmed Spider. Spider . told Al-Tahrir TV channel baubles on a . Christmas tree featured in the commercial represented bombs. Claims: A little-known rapper claims this advert by Vodafone Egypt includes signals for bomb attacks by the Muslim Brotherhood . He said the tree's branches mimicked . the four-finger gesture used to symbolise the raid by security forces last year which killed hundreds of supporters of ousted . Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in Cairo. The ad shows Egyptian puppet character . Abla Fahita and her daughter Karkoura desperately searching for her . deceased father's SIM card. Speaking on the phone with a friend called 'Mama Touta', Fahita says she asked for the sniffer dog of a shopping . mall to search for the missing card. Spider said the mall and the dog were code words for the planned sites of a coming attack. He added that 'Mama Touta' was a name for the Brotherhood. 'These elements tell us that there will be a big mall and an explosion after a dog fails to find the bomb in a car', he said. Vodafone, the world's biggest mobile operator by revenue, rejected the suggestions there was any hidden meaning. Messages: Ahmed Spider says this Christmas tree mimics a gesture used during a raid last year that killed hundreds of Mursi supporters. He says the baubles are meant to be bombs . In . a statement yesterday it said the ad posted on YouTube and social media . channels, which features a well-known puppet character, was meant to . promote a special offer for customers to re-activate their old SIM . cards. Any other . explanations 'are pure fiction and personal opinions' for which the . company is not responsible, it added, suggesting it might take legal . action 'against whomever (is) trying to distort the company's . reputation'. 'Abla . Fahita is a comic character, used in this ad as a tool to clarify the . offer to viewers/customers, in a comic and sarcastic context,' Vodafone . said in its statement. 'The ad . is only a marketing communication tool. It does not carry any hidden . messages or meanings other than what has been mentioned above.' 'Fiction': Vodafone strongly deny the claims, saying the advert - which features several famous Egyptian puppets (pictured) - is 'comic' and 'sarcastic' Company spokesman Khaled Hegazy had . earlier said that employees from Vodafone Egypt's marketing and legal . departments had been asked about who made the commercial. 'We . are very sad that there are people who think in this way in Egypt,' said Hegazy, voicing concern a top state prosecutor had taken the suggestion the advert was promoting . terrorism seriously. Security sources told Reuters reporters the singer was known to be an anti-Islamist and a supporter of the army which last July removed elected president Mursi after protests against his rule. The case triggered satirical comment on social media. Backlash: Twitter users yesterday mocked the rapper's claims, saying the puppet couldn't possibly represent terrorism . 'Egypt . security: If somebody sees or knows where Abla Fahita, the Muslim . Brotherhood terrorist puppet, is hiding contact our Muslim Brotherhood . hotline,' a tweet under the name of arab resistance read. Another . tweet by Iyad El-Baghdadi said: 'Forget the four-finger sign, Abla . Fahita should become the symbol of resistance to Egypt's new regime' The government has designated Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation and accused it of carrying out a suicide bomb attack last week on a police compound in Nile Delta in which 16 people were killed. The Brotherhood, long Egypt's main political opposition force, has denied any links to the attack.

As Christians around the world prepare to mark the birth of Jesus by celebrating Christmas, a former Archbishop of Canterbury has warned that the religion is being increasingly marginalised in Britain. George Carey says that Christians are pressured to hide their faith at work, with many religious people cowed into 'increasing timidity' by society's secular leanings. He also spoke out about the plight of minority Christian populations in the Middle East and elsewhere who are being oppressed by governments and their fellow countrymen. Speaking out: George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, says that many Christians in Britain feel under pressure to hide their religious faith . Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Carey said: 'I am worried about the future of faith in the West. Many Christians I meet say there is a pressure on them to be silent about their faith. 'Though there can be no question of a comparison with the powerlessness and weakness of the Church in the Middle East, there is an increasing timidity on the part of churchgoers in the West - about even admitting that they have a faith in the workplace.' The issue of Christians' religious freedom in the workplace has repeatedly appeared in the headlines over the past few years. Warning: Prince Charles has spoken of his concerns about the oppression of Christians in the Middle East . In January, a BA employee who was banned from wearing a cross at work won a â‚¬2,000 payout after a court determined that her religious rights had been breached. But this month, a care home worker who sued her employer for making her work on a Sunday lost her case for unfair dismissal. Lord Carey, who served as Archbishop of Canterbury from 1991 to 2002, has previously spoken of his worries about the future of the Church of England. Last month he told the General Synod: 'We are one generation away from extinction - if we do not invest in young people there is going to be no one in the future.' In his Christmas message in the Telegraph, the former Archbishop also drew attention to Prince Charles's concerns about the future of ancient Christian communities in the Middle East. Christians in countries such as Egypt and Palestine, where the faith has been established longer than anywhere else, are under threat from the hostility of governments and majority Muslim populations. 'Successive governments have done little to speak up for Christians facing human rights abuses in Africa and the Middle East,' Lord Carey wrote. 'In fact this Government, which has conspicuously sought friendly and co-operative relationships with the churches, is doing just as much to wash its hands of persecuted Christian communities as any of its predecessors.' Concerns: Lord Carey said that many people are complacent about Christianity's place in society . He suggested that many people overlook the plight of Christians because the religion is considered to be comparatively powerful thanks to its historical dominance in the West. 'Far from being important and influential, in many parts of the world Christianity is weak and despised, and Christians are attacked and killed,' Lord Carey wrote. 'In Nigeria, churches are firebombed; in Pakistan, churchgoers are prosecuted under draconian blasphemy laws, while in Egypt, they are either marginalised or assaulted.'","George Carey says Christians feel they must hide their religion at work .

Dramatic new photographs taken by a shaken passenger following the Asiana Airlines plane crash on Saturday have revealed the chaotic moments after the jetliner smashed into the ground at San Francisco Airport. The images, taken by Eugene Anthony Rah, show thick billowing smoke and flames overwhelming the shell of the plane as scores of passengers run for safety. The smoke clouds the sky as emergency responders battle the fire, and passengers and air hostesses huddle together in shock on the tarmac. Amid the chaos, it is possible that an emergency responder vehicle hit and killed one of teenagers who died in the wreckage, authorities revealed. Two 16-year-old Chinese schoolgirls, Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, died in the crash but officials said one was possibly hit by a fire truck or an ambulance. San Francisco's medical examiner is now conducting an autopsy to determine whether she was dead before she was struck. 'One of the deceased did have injuries consistent with those of having been run over by a vehicle,' fire department spokeswomen Mindy Talmadge said. 'Many agencies were on the field.'

Rah, a 46-year-old concert producer and naturalized U.S. citizen who took the photographs, said that he noticed one flight attendant, Kim Ji-yeon, stood out as she was 'carrying people piggyback' who couldnâ€™t walk. He said that she was sobbing as she helped clear the plane just minutes before flames engulfed the plane and that he noted down her name because 'she was a hero'. Images from inside the stricken Asiana Airlines Flight 214 have also been released by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. They show seats slammed out of their rivets and oxygen masks dangling from the overhead compartments, giving some indication of the terror that the 307 passengers and crew experienced during the plane's botched landing.

'He was training,' a spokeswoman for Asiana Airlines, Lee Hyomin, said. 'Even a veteran gets training. He has a lot of experience and previously had flown to San Francisco on different planes, including the B747 ... and was assisted by another pilot who has more experience with the 777.' The black box on the Boeing 777 jetliner detailed three crucial moments - beginning 7 seconds before impact - . that show the plane was approaching the runway too slowly and that the pilots were trying to correct the problem.

It was at that point that the pilots tried to increase the speed of the . plane. 'We have to take another look at the . raw data and corroborate it with radar and air traffic information to . make sure we have a very precise speed,' Hersman said. 'But again, we are not talking about a few knots here or there. We're talking about a significant amount of speed below 137.' By . all accounts, the plane was set to land normally - its landing gear was . down and its flaps were set to the standard 30 degrees.

Not these beasts in Finland - who sprang and leaped over an obstacle course as if they were horses. Farmers who gathered at an agricultural show picked their favourite animals for a bizarre 'bovine agility' contest, which pitched the 1,500-pound beasts against each other in a dusty arena. Bizarre: An animal looks as though it is levitating as it is captured mid-way through a jump at the contest . Dairy to dream: A cow's owner leads her through an obstacle course at the Helsinki Exhibition and Convention Centre. The 'bovine agility' contest was part of an annual food and countryside trade fair . Stubborn: Not all the cows in the competition were so willing - this one refused to obey its owner's orders . The huge animals were pictured leaping over hurdles with one even clearing herself several feet from the ground. The unusual event was held yesterday as part of the annual Helsinki Food and Countryside Show. The trade fair has run for 20 years - and jumping cows were not its only unusual attraction. There was also a bovine beauty contest which aimed to find a 'Mr and Miss' to be crowned king and queen of the show. Spokesman Tarja Gordienko told MailOnline: 'These kinds of funny things are to show what these animals can do and that they're not just there to produce food for us. They have human-like traits. Leap: The fast-paced event echoed show-jumping for horses, which is well-established an Olympic sport . Fast moo-vers: The best cows were rewarded by their owners for their high-energy antics . 'It's all about bringing the countryside to the city centre because there are a lot of families who haven't ever seen cows or horses or chickens.' Last year the show had more than 50,000 visitors. There were the usual draws for . farmers' fairs, including sheepdog trials, rare breeds of ponies and a . show of chickens and goats. Photographer Milla Takala, who took these photos, told MailOnline: 'I hadn't seen anything like that before so it was quite funny for me. It's not exactly a common thing to see in Finland. 'There were ten cows and the fastest one round the course won the first prize. The fastest cow took just over a minute.' The animals were not the first show-jumping cows. The novelty act has been practiced all over Europe in the last few years - including in Finland, Belgium and Germany. German schoolgirl Regina Mayer, 15, made headlines in 2011 when she revealed she treated her cow Luna just like a horse, including going for long rides together in the country. 'She's often very headstrong but can also be really adorable,' the schoolgirl said. Riding cows has been popular for centuries, but the animals often take more training than horses, are more stubborn and have to be started on younger. The animals were not the first show-jumping cows - the novelty act has been practised all over Europe including by 15-year-old Regina Mayer, pictured leaping a hurdle with her cow Luna in 2011 . Anne Wiltafsky, a cow trainer who . lives near the Swiss city of Zurich, said of Regina's case: 'Especially . younger [cows] can jump really well. 'Cows are lovable companions because they are easygoing, have strong nerves and are unbelievably devoted to people they like.'","Novelty show-jumping event was part of a countryside show in Helsinki .

Nelson Mandela’s grandson Mandla, a member of the South African parliament, has been charged with serious assault after an altercation with a teacher during which he drew a firearm, according to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). Mr Mandela, 39, is said to have attacked Mlamli Ngudle and pointed a gun at him after the teacher reportedly crashed into a car belonging to one of Mandela's business partners at a function in the city of Mthatha. On Thursday, at the Regional Court in the city, Senior Public Prosecutor Jongikhaya Busakwe laid out two charges against Mr Mandela – assault with intent to do grevious bodily harm and pointing a firearm, SABC said. Mandla Mandela, grandson of former South African president Nelson Mandela, dressed in traditional dress, has been charged with serious assault and pointing a firearm . Mr Mandela appeared at the hearing but made no plea. The case was postponed to February 24 after his lawyer, Kenny Oldwage, pointed out that the defence had only received the police file in the morning. Oldwage is a high profile local attorney who also represents Paralympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius, charged with shooting dead his girlfriend on Valentines' Day in 2013. Mr Mandela has been surrounded by controversy in recent months. Mandla Mandela, attending the funeral service of late South African President Nelson Mandela in his childhood village of Qunu . Last year he moved the graves of his grandfather’s three deceased children without permission from other family members leading to charges of grave-tampering being levelled against him. This charge was subsequently dropped, along with a charge of bigamy. Meanwhile, a feud has reportedly engulfed the Mandela family following the death of Nelson Mandela with relatives arguing over who will head the clan. The ex-wife of the human rights icon, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, has said that the oldest child, Makaziwe Mandela, 60, will head the clan – not Madla, his oldest grandchild. Ms Makaziwe Mandela is the only living child from Mandela’s first marriage to Evelyn Mase. The Johannesburg tabloid The Times reported in December that Mandla found himself locked out of the Mandela homestead in the Eastern Cape hamlet of Qunu, where Mandela was buried. According to the report, Makaziwe had ordered the locks changed after she arrived while Mandla was keeping vigil next to his grandfather's coffin as the body lay in state at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Mandla, also known as Chief Zwelivelile, recently launched a televised tirade against his relatives, whom he accused of trying to grow rich from the Mandela name.

The parents of a teenage girl who was run over and killed by two emergency vehicles after last summers' Asiana Airlines crash, have filed a claim against the city of San Francisco, saying rescuers were reckless and poorly trained. The parents of 16-year-old Ye Meng Yuan say firefighters who first saw the girl after the July 6 crash should have examined her and moved her somewhere safe. Firefighters told investigators they assumed the girl was dead and instead hurried on toward the damaged aircraft. Newly released footage shows workers walking past her body without stopping. However, an autopsy revealed Yuan was alive before two fire vehicles hit her. Scroll down for video . Killed: Ye Meng Yuan, left, 16, was by a fire truck after the Asiana plane crash.

In all, 304 of the 307 people aboard . the plane survived after the airliner slammed into a seawall at the end . of a runway during final approach for landing. The . impact ripped off the back of the plane, tossed out three flight . attendants and their seats, and scattered pieces of the jet across the . runway as it spun and skidded to a stop. Yuan was one of three Chinese teens who died; one died during the crash, and another later in the hospital. In . their claim, attorneys at the Los Angeles law firm Kreindler and .

Confusion: Tapes of 911 emergency calls reveal the panic and confusion that engulfed the aftermath of the crash . Lawsuit: The family of a teenage girl who was struck and killed by emergency vehicles in the aftermath of an Asiana Airlines plane crash filed a civil claim against the city of San Francisco, alleging gross negligence . In . an obituary, Yuan was described as a champion athlete who excelled at . literature, playing piano, singing and public speaking. Her given name . means 'wish come true' in Chinese. It . is still unknown how Yuan got out of the plane, but the claim says she . was possibly taken out by rescuers. Interviews for an ongoing National . Traffic Safety Board found Yuan was covered with foam and struck twice â€” once by a fire rig spraying foam whose driver had seen and driven . around her earlier in the chaos, and again 11 minutes later by a second . truck that was turning around to fetch water. Her . death has prompted new training for firefighters who work at San . Francisco International Airport, including 40 to 80 hours of advanced . instruction at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. 'There . are many lessons to be learned here,' Assistant Deputy Chief Dale . Carnes, who oversees the San Francisco Fire Department's airport . division, said during a NTSB hearing in December. 'We are developing . strategies to lessen the potential for firefighting vehicles impacting . accident victims.' Chaos: Three flight attendants and one Chinese student, who died in the accident, were ejected from the back of the plane after the tail broke off . Charred: Asiana Flight 214 burst into flames after crash landing July 6 at San Francisco International Airport . The driver of the first of two San . Francisco Fire Department rigs that struck the girl said he was alerted . less than 15 minutes earlier to avoid the her as she lay on the ground. The . footage, taken by a dashboard camera aboard the rig and reviewed . Thursday by The San Francisco Chronicle, sheds new light on the . circumstances surrounding the death of Ye Meng Yuan. Several . firefighters who responded to the July 6 crash have told investigators . they believed Ye was dead and that they had concentrated on rescuing . passengers and crew members who were still aboard the burning Boeing . 777. No one has reported checking her vital signs, however. The . rig camera's footage shows that although the plane had crashed just a . few minutes earlier, passengers were gone from the area where Ye lay . crumpled, and at one point a firefighter walked past her without looking . down. It also shows that the first rig that ran over Ye sprayed . much of the flame-retardant foam that came to obscure her from . firefighter drivers. When the rig initially pulled up to the plane, the girl was lying on bare ground, the footage shows. The . dashboard camera's footage showed a firefighter Roger Phillips waving . his arms to direct the driver of a fire truck to travel around the girl. The NTSB were later told that the firefighter assumed the girl was dead. The . footage shows no firefighter attempting to move Ye or mark her with a . casualty flag, as first responders commonly do at disaster scenes. Foam gradually covered the girl, and the fire truck went onto the plane Yee, working without a spotter, advanced on the plane. The plane struck a seawall just short of the runway, shearing off its tail and sending the rest of the airliner sliding and turning down the runway before breaking apart and catching fire . Aftermath: 911 calls have revealed passengers' terror after Flight 214 crashed in San Francisco and how they waited for more than half an hour for ambulance to arrive at the scene .

Climate Change] has very low confidence there has been any trend in the . number or intensity of typhoons.’ Mr Lilley added: ‘I don’t mind him wading in on issues but he should have got his facts right.’ A . spokesman from the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘We . cannot currently say whether Haiyan was or was not affected by climate . change. ‘But scientific . evidence shows that extreme weather events are most certainly . intensifying and this is expected to continue as global warming . proceeds.’ Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, scientists warned that extreme weather events would increase if global warming continued at its current rate and these warnings have been echoed in Prince Charles’ address today. Global warming is attributed to rising sea levels as the increase in temperatures causes the ice caps to melt.  As sea levels rise, the chances of storm surges increase. A surge is an abnormal rise of water produced by a storm, caused by strong onshore winds and a drop in atmospheric pressure. These storms go hand-in-hand with tropical cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons. The rising levels also increase the chances of flooding associated with hurricanes and other extreme weather events. Elsewhere, global warming is said to have increased the amount of rainfall across the globe because the rising temperatures increase the amount of moisture in the air. This is similarly associated with extreme weather events. As the Earth’s temperature rises, the seas become warmer. Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have risen by 0.5°C over the past decade and this trend is set to continue. Hurricane expert Kerry Emanuel first suggested in the late 80s that an increase in SSTs would cause stronger hurricanes and this threat is increased in areas where the sea temperatures are above 25°C. However, the effect man-made climate change is having on global warming has not been categorically proved. Although scientists don’t deny global warming is causing the rise in extreme weather events, how much of this is down to man-made events is said to be ‘inconclusive.’","Death toll from Haiyan in Philippines is now expected to exceed 10,000 .

A disgruntled Kansas City sportswriter's claims that he buried $200,000 in gold and silver coins in local a park before committing suicide has brought on a mad rush of treasure hunters who have arrived with shovels, picks and metal detectors hoping to strike it rich. Local police have been forced to post officers to guard the Overland Park Arboretum in Kansas, where Martin Manley indicated his fortune could be hidden. Dozens of people who have sought to dig for the treasure have been turned away. Both police and Mr Manley's family say the promise of buried treasure is a hoax. His family says he sold or gave away all of his precious coins before his death. Police said they swept the area with a metal detector and found nothing. Hoax: Sportswriter Martin Manley caused a treasure hunt for gold after his website listed coordinates on the day he died . Trail: The coordinates led treasure seekers to Oakland Park Arboretum . 'He did not bury it,' Sean Riley, a city spokesman, told KCTV. 'You have a better chance of winning a prize from the Lotto than you do finding anything out here.' Police have orders to prevent anyone from digging at the arboretum, which is illegal because it is city property. That didn't stop Kansas City-native Riley Ewing from looking under bushes for signs of recently-disturbed earth where Mr Manley may have buried his fortune. 'I'm going out with empty pockets, but it certainly was fun,' he told the TV station. The park was forced to close Friday as treasure hunters descended on it and started to dig hours after Mr Manley killed himself. Mr Manley, a prominent sports statistician and Kansas City sports blogger, shot himself early Thursday in front of the Overland Park police station. His blog linked to a personal website in which he declared he was committing suicide and outlined his political views and reasons for killing himself. Sealed off: As rumors about a stash of gold circulated police were forced to bar entry to the park . Updates: Members of a radio station joined the search and tweeted details of their journey . Watch: The park had to be closed as people armed with shovels started to turn up . It was one statement on that site that had led to the treasure-hunting fury. Mr Manley wrote: 'I sold my house which was . completely paid for in 1998. The same year I bought $30,000 in 1/10 . ounce gold coins and pre-1965 silver coins. Gold was $300/ounce when I . bought it and silver was $4/ounce. Gold went up to $1,700 and Silver to . $44 making my stash worth over $200,000.' He then listed the coordinates, which led to Overland Park arboretum. Radio station 96.5 The Buzz fueled . the search, reading excerpts of Mr Manley's website live on air and . encouraging listeners and one of their team, 'Mark the Overseer' to go on . a treasure hunt. Through Twitter Mark and other treasure hunters, some armed with shovels, sent updates and pictures as they followed the coordinates to the arboretum. The . morning show presenters excitedly egged listeners on as they called in . updating the station on their hunt while the hosts speculated on Mr Manley's life. Clue: A member of the radio show tweeted a picture of a flag in the undergrowth, asking 'what does it mean' Mr Manley, who died on his 60th birthday, had worked as a sports reporter on the Kansas City Star until February last year. He had been married and divorced twice, and had two step-daughters. Editor at the Kansas City Star Mike Fannin said: 'Martin was a terrific guy and a good employee.

The . 32-year-old orthopaedic surgeon from London was captured in November . last year in the ancient city of Aleppo after travelling from Turkey to . help victims of hospital bombings. His death was announced on December . 17. At a packed funeral prayer service his brother Shahnawaz Khan said: ‘Last night I sat down to undertake the morbid task of writing a eulogy for my brother.’ He added: ‘My brother, to us, was our star. His star shone on our family.’ Dr Khan was described by his brother as the ‘kindest and simplest man I’ve ever met’. Loss of life: Dr Abbas Khan, 32, pictured with his son Abdullah, had spent more than a year in jail . Mr Khan spoke of ‘the evil that has taken him from us so cruelly’ and said the family had been through ‘one of the most difficult times we have ever seen’. The doctor’s mother Fatima has dismissed a claim by Syria’s deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad that her son killed himself. Earlier this month, the family revealed a letter in which the doctor expressed his optimism at being released and his hopes of being home in time for Christmas.

Obviously we know tomorrow the inquest will be formally opened and then the process will start of collating evidence for the coroner to finally reach a judgment when the inquest concludes. ‘For today’s purposes the family is very, very grateful for the level of support they’ve received from the British public so far and the priority for them is obviously to lay the body to rest so they can have some form of closure, albeit the process of the inquest will start tomorrow and will conclude in due course after which we will consider what legal avenues are open to us to conclude this matter, and hopefully find some form of justice if that exists in this case.’ He said the idea of suicide was ‘inconceivable’. When Mr Sheikh was asked if he thought the British government had done enough to help, he said: ‘I think the family would think they haven’t done enough, there has been no real contact with them whatsoever. ‘On numerous occasions they have tried to seek a meeting with (Foreign Secretary) William Hague but to no avail. ‘The only thing they have really received is a letter from the Prime Minister post the tragic event occurring.’ Dr Khan’s brother recalled his childhood play fighting and sleeping beside him. ‘Now seeing all of you, and remembering those days, I feel I was truly blessed,’ he said. Before Mr Khan spoke about his brother, an imam said the doctor ‘gave his life as a sacrifice’. He said Dr Khan went to Syria ‘with the pure intention to save lives’. Karimah Bint Daoud, a female chaplain at the Muslim College in Ealing, west London, attended the service and explained why there was such a big crowd. ‘For us, it’s like if one is killed, it affects all of us, and that’s what we believe. ‘So people will come out and show support for the family,’ she said. Dr Khan is to be taken to Ilford, East London, to be laid to rest. The inquest will open at 11am on Friday at Walthamstow Coroner’s Court.","Dr Abbas Khan was an orthopaedic surgeon from London .

Ed Balls was today branded a 'turkey' after it emerged he has been given nine months to save his job following a series of dismal performances. Ed Miliband is weighing up whether to sack his Shadow Chancellor amid internal criticism and polling evidence that he is damaging Labour’s election chances. Today in the Commons David Cameron seized on the revelation, claiming Mr Miliband was 'sitting next to a turkey' who was too weak to fire. Joke: Within minutes of David Cameron branding Ed Balls a turkey, parody account @GeneralBoles posted this image on Twitter . Ridicule: Ed Balls (left) was dismissed as a 'turkey' by David Cameron as he clashed with Ed Miliband (right) Mr Balls was Mr Miliband’s third choice for Shadow Chancellor after his brother David turned him down and Alan Johnson quit. His red-faced performance in response to George Osborne's Autumn Statement led senior Labour figures to admit that their key economic message was not being well-sold. A Shadow Cabinet source said Mr Balls had until Labour’s conference next September to come up with a credible economic plan or face the sack. ‘Ed doesn’t want to have to sack Balls because of the disruption it will cause, but if we’re still in difficulty on the economy by conference then he will do it,’ the source said. ‘You should not underestimate how ruthless Ed is. He will not let anything stand between us and the election, and that includes Ed Balls.’ Attack: Mr Cameron today dismissed Labour attacks on the government's economic policy, as employment figures showed a record 30million are now in work . The source acknowledged it would be ‘difficult’ to remove Mr Balls because of his powerbase in Labour’s Brownite camp and the trade unions, and his wife Yvette Cooper’s position as Shadow Home Secretary. But the source insisted that Mr Balls would come under intense pressure to knuckle under rather than destabilise Labour in the run-up to the 2015 election. ‘Yes, it would be difficult, particularly . with Yvette. But Balls could not afford to cause too much trouble nine . months out from an election – the party would never forgive it.’ David Cameron on Ed Balls . At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron clashed over unemployment figures and the impact on family finances. But as Mr Balls, sitting next to Mr Miliband, started gesticulating across the despatch box, Mr Cameron hit back: 'Ah! We have a new hand gesture from the shadow chancellor. 'I would have thought after today's briefing in the papers the hand gesture for the shadow chancellor should be ""bye bye"". 'You don't need it to be Christmas to know when you are sitting next to a turkey.' There has been speculation that the former Chancellor Alistair Darling might be tempted to return after he has finished leading the campaign to keep Scotland in the Union next autumn. One Labour source said: ‘Alistair Darling is an option. But people putting it forward forget that Ed’s big picture message is that we have moved on from the last Labour government. Alistair doesn’t fit with that.’ Other possible successors include the shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, the shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves and the shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander. Decision: Senior Labour figures say leader Ed Miliband will have to decide whether to keep Mr Balls in post in time for the 2015 election . Tipped: Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (left) and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves are seen as possible successors to Mr Balls . Mr Balls – who wrongly predicted the Coalition’s economic plans would cause a triple-dip recession – has come under intense pressure in recent months as the economic recovery gathers pace. An opinion poll at the weekend showed that although Labour retains an overall lead, just 21 per cent trust the party on the economy, compared to 32 per cent supporting Mr Osborne and Mr Cameron. Senior Labour source . Senior Labour figure are concerned that Mr Balls’s strident criticism of the Government’s deficit reduction programme will come back to haunt them if the recovery takes off. Mr Balls has spent the last three years talking down the economy, predicting a triple-dip recession and the loss of one million jobs – and warning that Government cuts would ‘choke off ‘ the recovery. Mr Balls sparked derision in the Commons earlier this month when he accused the Chancellor George Osborne of being ‘in denial’ about the economy. The crimson-faced Shadow Chancellor stumbled on, but his performance led to fresh questions about whether he was now an electoral liability. One Labour MP said he had ‘f***ed up’ Labour’s economic policy by refusing to change course despite overwhelming evidence that the recovery is underway. In an angry response Mr Balls insisted he didn’t ‘give a t***’ about criticism of his performance. David Cameron mocked him in the Commons last week, saying the pugnacious Shadow Chancellor ‘can dish it out, but he can’t take it’. Ominously, Mr Miliband laughed openly at his Shadow Chancellor’s discomfort when Mr Cameron suggested his career was ‘going down’. Tensions between Labour’s top two emerged last month when a leaked email from one of Mr Miliband’s senior aides described Mr Balls as a ‘nightmare’. Shadow Cabinet ministers are also braced for a series of bruising encounters with Mr Balls in the New Year as Labour tries to hammer out its manifesto position on key issues like education and health reform. Blairite figures warn that Mr Balls is a ‘roadblock’ to reform, and still wants to keep an iron grip on public services from the centre, rather than devolving power and tailoring services to users.","Shadow Cabinet insiders insist Miliband can be 'ruthless' with whole team .

"By . Erik Bielderman . PUBLISHED: . 20:18 EST, 30 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:40 EST, 31 December 2013 . Erik Bielderman is a French football writer, columnist and TV pundit. Nicolas Anelka could have chosen to pay respect to Nelson Mandela. Instead, he chose Dieudonne M'bala M'bala. To celebrate his first goal in England since August 20, 2011, West Brom’s French striker decided to express his support and friendship for a French  so-called humorist by doing the provocative hand gesture, la quenelle. Anelka has tried to portray his actions as an innocent anti-establishment action but just think about the timing. Controversy: This gesture, performed by Dieubonne and Anelka, has landed the striker in hot water . In the latest sickening episode involving Dieudonne, he made these comments on stage about Patrick Cohen, a French radio journalist: ‘When I hear him (Cohen), I tell myself, you know, gas chamber . . . too bad.’ After a video emerged of the incident, the French government issued a statement saying it would take every legal action possible to ban Dieudonne’s shows and public meetings in the future. This story was headline news in the French media on the  morning of West Brom’s match against West Ham, which was shown live on Canal+ in France. In the past two days, the vast majority of the French public have expressed disgust at his actions but a minority of French  citizens still believe la quenelle is anti-Zionist — and not anti-Semitic. These people have used the internet and Twitter to paint Dieudonne and Anelka as  victims of the political and media worlds. Flashpoint: Anelka performed the celebration after scoring for West Brom at Upton Park . Anelka’s supporters ask why French . society and the  government did not react with similar outrage when la . quenelle was made by Liverpool’s Mamadou Sakho, judo world champion . Teddy Riner and French-born basketball star Tony Parker — who last night . apologised for making the gesture. An important distinction is that these gestures were made in private, not a sporting arena. They also ask why nothing  happened when . Mathieu Deplagne, a French Ligue 1 player from Sochaux, did la . quenelle on the field after scoring last January? By making his gesture on the pitch, . Anelka knew that in France the reaction would be huge. Wasn’t the . political climate heavy enough? His action was also provocative towards English football’s rulers and FIFA, who prohibit expression of political, social or religious issues on the football stage. Shock: A picture of Nasri performing the same move emerged as did one of basketball star Parker . They were also provocative in the . context of a French society which is focusing on the integration debate. Months before the local and European elections are held, the Front . National looks as if they could become the largest political party in . France in terms of voters.  Unemployment and immigration are among the . most sensitive themes in the political campaign. Despite the bitter atmosphere in . France around these  questions for many years now, Dieudonne remained in . a relative shadow and was regarded as an underground agitator. Even . if he claims to have around 426,000 'likes' on Facebook and 43,000 . followers on Twitter, Dieudonne and his quenelle had not received a . significant public airing. Now, . thanks to Anelka, it is on the front pages in France and is being . discussed by everyone. Dieudonne could not have wished for better . publicity for his views. Anelka portrays himself as an anti-establishment hero but this is an anti-establishment hero who is pictured emerging from his Rolls-Royce at the entrance to London Heliport and has appeared in an advert in France for the hamburger restaurant chain ‘Quick’. Picking up the pieces: West Brom caretaker boss Downing has been left to pick up the pieces . When West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football. But the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland. Here, we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala: .","Anelka facing minimum five-match ban over gesture .

Never-before-seen footage from the frantic aftermath of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 runway crash in July reveals that firefighters tragically did not realize that a 16-year-old victim was still alive - only to run her over twice 15 minutes later. Video from a camera mounted on a San Francisco firetruck shows at least two emergency workers alerting vehicles to go around Chinese student Ye Meng Yuan as she lay on the ground by the stricken aircraft. The first responders believed she was dead and did not check her vital signs. One lieutenant told crash investigators that she made 'a three second' visual assessment of Miss Yuan and automatically assumed 'that's our first casualty' - without putting a finger to her pulse or checking if she was still breathing. Less than 15 minutes after the first driver had seen Miss Yuan, they drove over the teen who was now covered in the foam being used to douse the burning plane. Moments later, a second fire truck rode over the student's body. Scroll down for video . Not covered in foam: Firefighters told investigators they assumed Ye Meng Yuan, 16, (seen on the grass) was dead and instead hurried on toward the damaged aircraft . A dashboard camera aboard a San Francisco Fire Department rig shows crash victim Ye Meng Yuan, in the foreground and partially obscured by foam. The rig ran over Miss Yuan seconds later . The video, obtained by CBS News last week, does not show the trucks running her over but the original footage is in the possession of the distraught teenage girl's family and legal team in China. The official line from the San Francisco Fire Department is that the girl was accidentally struck by trucks racing to battle the fiery wreck of the Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 because she was hidden by foam sprayed over the plane. However, the newly released footage shows that some emergency workers were aware there was a body in the vicinity - including the driver of the truck which ran over her first. Ye was one of three people to die as the plane misjudged its landing at San Francisco on July 6 and struck its tail section on a sea wall as it came into land - 304 people survived. The impact ripped off the back of the plane, tossed out three flight attendants and their seats, and scattered pieces of the jet across the runway as it spun and skidded to a stop. Highlighted: A camera aboard 'Rescue Truck 10' shows a firefighter directing the truck around Ye on the ground - 15 minutes later he would run her over . Miss Yuan's body lies covered in foam as firefighters battle to put out the flames from the crashed Asiana Airlines plane on July 6 last year . Miss Yuan was one of three Chinese teenagers who died; the second died during the crash and another later in the hospital. Her parents have filed a claim against the city of San Francisco, saying rescuers were reckless and poorly trained. In their claim, attorneys representing Yuan's parents name 37 specific airport, fire and police department employees, saying they and others 'breached their duty of care'. They do not specify damages. In the video footage, a firefighter can be clearly be heard saying: 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop,' to the driver of one of the first responding trucks at the scene. 'There's a body right there, right in front of you,' the firefighter adds.

Firetrucks: Foam is sprayed at the burning wreck of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 as it sits on the tarmac of San Francisco airport in July . Investigators all agree that at the time of this diversion, Miss Yuan was still alive. Firefighters told investigators they assumed the girl was dead and instead hurried on toward the damaged aircraft. Newly released footage shows workers walking past her body without stopping. An autopsy revealed Miss Yuan was alive before two fire vehicles hit her. In an obituary, the teenager was described as a champion athlete who excelled at literature, playing piano, singing and public speaking. Her given name means 'wish come true' in Chinese. It is still unknown how Miss Yuan got out of the plane but the claim says she was possibly taken out by rescuers. Killed: .

Best . of friend: Ye Meng Yuan and Yuan Linjia, both 16, died when the Boeing . 777 passenger jet slammed into a seawall while attempting to land . Interviews for an ongoing National Traffic Safety Board found Miss Yuan was covered with foam and struck twice - once by a fire rig spraying foam whose driver had seen and driven around her earlier in the chaos and again 11 minutes later by a second truck that was turning around to fetch water. Her death has prompted new training for firefighters who work at San Francisco International Airport, including 40 to 80 hours of advanced instruction at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. 'There are many lessons to be learned here,' Assistant Deputy Chief Dale Carnes, who oversees the San Francisco Fire Department's airport division, said during a NTSB hearing in December. 'We are developing strategies to lessen the potential for firefighting vehicles impacting accident victims.' The driver of the first of two San Francisco Fire Department rigs that struck the girl said that he was alerted less than 15 minutes earlier to avoid the her as she lay on the ground. Confusion: Tapes of 911 emergency calls reveal the panic and confusion that engulfed the aftermath of the crash . Lawsuit: The family of a teenage girl who was struck and killed by emergency vehicles in the aftermath of an Asiana Airlines plane crash filed a civil claim against the city of San Francisco, alleging gross negligence . The footage, taken by a dashboard camera aboard the rig and reviewed last Thursday by The San Francisco Chronicle, sheds new light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Ye Meng Yuan. Several firefighters who responded to the July 6 crash have told investigators they believed Miss Yuan was dead and that they had concentrated on rescuing passengers and crew members who were still aboard the burning Boeing 777. No one has reported checking her vital signs, however. The rig camera's footage shows that although the plane had crashed just a few minutes earlier, passengers were gone from the area where Miss Yuan lay and at one point a firefighter walked past her without looking down. It also shows that the first rig that ran over Miss Yuan sprayed much of the flame-retardant foam that came to obscure her from drivers. Chaos: Three flight attendants and one Chinese student, who died in the accident, were ejected from the back of the plane after the tail broke off . Charred: Asiana Flight 214 burst into flames after crash landing July 6 at San Francisco International Airport . When the rig initially pulled up to the plane, the girl was lying on bare ground, the footage shows. The dashboard camera's footage showed firefighter Roger Phillips waving his arms to direct the driver of a fire truck to travel around the girl. The NTSB was later told that the firefighter assumed the girl was dead. The footage shows no firefighter attempting to move Miss Yuan or mark her with a casualty flag, as first responders commonly do at disaster scenes. Aftermath: 911 calls have revealed passengers' terror after Flight 214 crashed in San Francisco and how they waited for more than half an hour for ambulance to arrive at the scene . Human error: Meanwhile, investigators have found no evidence of mechanical problems with Asiana Flight 214, putting the focus of the safety probe into the crash landing at the San Francisco airport squarely on the pilots . Justin Green is one of the attorneys representing her family. 'What the family wants is accountability,' he said to CBS News. 'They want to know why weren't the firefighters trained, why weren't the supervisors certified and why hasn't the fire department come clean about what happened?' The San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) does not comment on pending lawsuits. SFFD Chief Mary Hayes-White has previously said: 'Our members that day had difficult decisions to make. One was visualizing someone that appeared to be dead versus going onto the burning plane with reports of people that still needed to be rescued.'","Never-before-seen footage from the minutes after Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crash on July 6 last year in San Francisco has emerged .

Breaking silence: Edward Snowden gave his first interviews since seeking asylum in Russia last August in an story published by the Washington Post Monday night . Six months after being forced to seek asylum in Russia, NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden is content with the work he's done to expose how the U.S. government was spying on its own people. He told the Washington Post in his first interview since arriving in Moscow that his 'mission's already accomplished'. 'I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated,' he said. Snowden explained that he wasn't out to change society by releasing secrets on the NSA's wiretapping programs. He just wanted the public to have the information necessary to make a decision on whether they were comfortable with such wide-reaching intelligence gathering. This greater good has come at a huge personal cost to Snowden, as a target appeared on his back the moment the first articles were published using his leaked information last May. By then, Snowden was already out of the country in Hong Kong, but he soon outstayed his welcome there. En route to Latin America, the U.S. cancelled his passport and he was stuck in limbo in the Moscow airport. President Vladimir Putin eventually agreed to give Snowden a temporary asylum in the country last August, but Snowden still seems uneasy in his current home. During his two days of interviews with the Post, the reporter notes that the 'ascetic' never goes outside once. Snowden says he lives off ramen noodles and chips and spends most of his hours on the internet keeping up on the progress of his cause back in the states. No longer the company man: Snowden became unwelcome in his own country last spring when he supplied journalists with information on how the NSA (headquarters pictured above) spies on American citizens . 'It has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house,' he said. 'I just don't have a lot of needs...Occasionally there's things to go do, things to go see, people to meet, tasks to accomplish, But it's really got to be goal-oriented, you know. Otherwise, as long as I can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody, that's more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks.' Snowden is believed to still have a cache of NSA documents in his possession, making him an uncomfortable Russian resident for the Obama administration. The administration has been staunchly against granting Snowden asylum in exchange for him not releasing the rest of the documents, saying they intend to prosecute him if he ever returns to the country. But that's not an opinion universally held. Rick Ledgett, the NSA's incoming deputy director, told 60 Minutes that Snowden is estimated to be in the possession of 1.7million documents and that he would favor giving the whistleblower amnesty to get those secrets back. Not welcome: Susan Rice, national security adviser to President Obama, says she is against granting amnesty to Snowden . Friendly chat: Snowden speaks with ex-U.S. intelligence officers in Russia last October . There are already rumors that Snowden may have already brokered the documents over to the Chinese or Putin - his current protector. But Snowden denies such allegations saying the documents were secured in a safe place, and that he doesn't even have any of the information on his laptop's hard drive or in Russia at all. 'There is no evidence at all for the claim that I have loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States,' he said. 'I have no relationship with the Russian government. I have not entered into any agreements with them.' 'If I defected at all,' Snowden said. 'I defected to the public.'","Edward Snowden leaked documents detailing the SNA's spying programs last May .

At least 45 people have been killed and 26 others wounded after gunmen disguised as traders stormed a weekly market in northeast Nigeria. The suspected Boko Haram onslaught in Borno, and the alleged shooting of 22 churchgoers in nearby Adamawa, came just a week after Nigeria's new military chief vowed to end the violence. No reason was given for the attacks, which have fuelled fears that the Islamist group - whose name means 'Western education is forbidden' - are growing in strength. The two attacks in Born and Adamawa come days after the Nigerian military chief vowed to end violence. Devastation at the hands of Boko Haram has ripped through the nation since 2009 (2011 attack pictured) The first strike in Kawuri, 23 miles from state capital Maiduguri, happened at about 4pm on Sunday when gunmen in four-wheel-drive vehicles opened fire with machine guns. Witnesses claim the gang set off homemade bombs that destroyed houses and other property. One trader who witnessed the latest . attack, said: 'The terrorists were armed with AK-47 rifles, improvised . explosive devices and petrol bombs. 'They entered the community and wreaked havoc before they fled into the Sambisa forest, which is not far from the village. 'It . was much, much later that security forces came and it was night . already, and the attackers had earlier subdued the soldiers that were . already on the ground.' Meanwhile, emergency relief and disaster agencies were deployed to a Roman Catholic church in the village of Waga Chakawa, in Adawama, where gunmen allegedly opened fire before setting homes ablaze. At least 22 were killed. Borno state police commissioner Lawan . Tanko said of the market strike: 'So far, we have 45 dead and 26 injured... but the figures . could increase as our men are still in the village searching for more . casualties.' Gunmen opened fire on a market in Borno while another group attacked churchgoers in Adamawa . Critics of the military strategy fear the latest attacks mean Boko Haram are strengthening as civilians flee . Mr Tanko, who blamed the attack on 'the Boko Haram sect', said he could not confirm that explosives were used but a specialist bomb disposal team had been sent in to search for unexploded devices. He added that security forces in Kawuri were powerless to prevent the attack, the latest in a string of similar incidents which have killed 1,200 civilians since the province was placed under emergency rule last May. Nigeria's military claims Boko Haram, which started its insurgency in 2009, has forced the Islamist extremists out of towns and cities and into more remote rural areas near the border. But critics of the military strategy claim the habitual attacks have also driven thousands of civilians to flee to neighbouring Cameroon, Niger and Chad. The country's president, Goodluck Jonathan, this month replaced his most senior military officers after a car bomb killed 19 in a crowded market in Maiduguri. Nigeria's new chief of defence staff, Air Marshall Alex Badeh, has vowed to bring the insurgency to 'a complete stop' before April.","Opened fire with machine guns and 'set off homemade bombs' in Borno .

"By . Erin Dean . PUBLISHED: . 19:24 EST, 6 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:21 EST, 7 January 2014 . Rachel suffers from aura migraine, which causes her vision to partially disappear for about 20 minutes . Rachel Paskin has suffered from migraines for almost 30 years but rarely has a headache. Instead, a bright, flashing line appears across her eyes, causing her vision to partly disappear. The 42-year-old has suffered up to five such attacks a day, severely affecting her work and ability to drive. What she experiences is known as a silent migraine - a type of migraine that comes without the severe headache typically associated with the condition. Instead, those affected experience visual  disturbance, co-ordination problems, and pins and needles (symptoms known as migraine 'aura'). 'The first time it happened I was about 14 and thought I was having a stroke or going blind - it was terrifying,' says Rachel, a Birmingham City University administrator who lives with her husband Neil, 44, a heritage building restorer, in Aldridge, West Midlands. She saw an optician, who reassured her there was nothing wrong with her eyes, but after doing her own research she realised what was causing her symptoms. She put up with the silent migraines and realised she would feel OK again after they passed, usually after about 20 minutes - although during that time she couldn't see properly and her co-ordination was compromised. On average, she had about five attacks a year but two years ago she started having the attacks four or five times a day so she sought medical help. In the aftermath, she felt 'spaced out' and tired for a few hours. Migraine aura can have a wide range of different symptoms, including seeing flashing lights, zigzag lines and blind spots, stiffness or a tingling sensation in the neck, shoulders and limbs, problems with co-ordination, difficulty speaking, and occasionally loss of consciousness. Aura often strikes just before a crippling headache, which usually sets in under an hour after the aura finishes. Experiences of aura varies. Some people never have a headache, and just experience aura, while others will initially  experience just aura symptoms, but then go on to experience severe headaches. Some people's migraines change as they age, so the headache can fade, while the aura remains. Around a third of the eight million people in the UK who suffer from  migraines experience the symptoms of aura, with an estimated 1 per cent - around 80,000 - having silent migraines, according to the Migraine Trust. However, the real number may be much higher, suggests Dr Mark Weatherall, a consultant neurologist at Charing Cross Hospital, London. He believes silent migraine cases are significantly under-reported, as many people will experience them infrequently and not seek help. The estimated number of migraine attacks that occur every day in the UK . But he warns it is important to rule out other causes if the symptoms suddenly start, particularly in the over-60s, as such symptoms are also linked with stroke and a detached retina (when the light-sensitive area at the back of the eye detaches from blood vessels, potentially causing blindness). 'It can even be difficult for a healthcare professional to tell the difference between the symptoms of a stroke and a  prolonged attack of aura,' he says. Indeed, people experiencing silent migraine for the first time often dash to A&E or their GP practice, frightened they are having a stroke - that's because they don't also have the headache symptom that might suggest it's a migraine, says Dr Andrew Dowson, director of headache services at King's College Hospital, London. 'Auras can be worrying,' he adds. The key point is that migraine aura symptoms develop relatively slowly, and then spread and intensify, while stroke symptoms are sudden, according to the Stroke Association. Migraines also involve acquiring symptoms, such as seeing flashing lights - stroke is characterised by losing abilities, such as muscle strength or speech. It's important to get the correct diagnosis of migraine with aura as it's linked to a higher risk of stroke and heart problems. Auras can happen without any of the traditional pain associated with migraine, but are distressing . A 15-year study into the health of 28,000 female health professionals at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in the U.S. found migraines with aura were the second highest risk factor for heart attack and stroke, after high blood pressure. A review of 25 studies published in the British Medical Journal in 2009 found risk of stroke for people with migraine with aura was twice as high as the rest of the population, while there was no extra risk for those with migraine without aura. For women with aura the risk of stroke was double that of men with aura. And a French study found that women who suffered migraine with aura who took the contraceptive Pill had a 16 times greater risk of stroke; if they smoked as well it led to a 34 times higher risk. For this reason, women with aura should not be on the combined Pill and should stop smoking, says Dr Fayyaz Ahmed, a consultant neurologist at Hull Royal Infirmary. 'Stroke risk is higher for those with aura, but it is still small, until you factor in smoking and taking the combined Pill. It is important doctors are aware of these risks to give correct advice.' Meanwhile, the British Heart Foundation says that people with aura should reduce their risk of heart trouble by keeping physically active, eating a healthy diet and not smoking - and advises anyone concerned by the risks to consult their GP for more advice. When Rachel was formally diagnosed two years ago, her GP prescribed propranolol, a beta blocker used for angina and high blood pressure, also found to be effective in reducing migraine (it's thought the medication, which reduces blood flow and opens blood vessels, helps by reducing electrical activity in the brain during migraine). After taking it for three months, her migraines subsided, and have since gone back to the usual rate of about five a year. Susan Haydon, from the Migraine Trust, says: 'No one is really sure why migraines can change. They tend to be worse in younger people, and may ease off in the 50s and 60s - 40 per cent of sufferers no longer have migraines by age 65. 'Attacks of migraine aura can cause a lack of confidence in leaving the home, because not being able to see properly can cause vulnerability. If a person drives for their job such attacks could mean a change of career.' If it interferes with driving safety, aura may need to be reported to the Driving and  Vehicle Licensing Authority. Triggers include foods such cheese or chocolate, alcohol, exercise, lack of sleep and stress . Migraine sufferers can usually identify triggers, and keeping a diary to record when attacks happen can be helpful. Triggers include foods such cheese or chocolate, alcohol, exercise, lack of sleep, and stress - avoiding them can reduce attacks. When attacks occur once a week or more, preventative medication, including beta blockers , antidepressants and epilepsy medication, can be prescribed. However, particularly with epilepsy medication, there can be unpleasant side-effects such as nausea, tiredness and depression. Some patients take supplements such as magnesium. Studies have suggested migraine patients may have low levels of the nutrient and two trials, one in Germany the other in Italy, have shown magnesium supplements helped reduce the number of migraines people suffered, although other trials have had mixed results. Meanwhile, the nutrient co-enzyme Q10 reduced the number of migraines people experienced by 50 per cent, in a study at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, while patients taking vitamin B2 (riboflavin) for a Belgian study also reported a 59 per cent drop in migraine activity. The Migraine Trust says many studies suggest mild regular aerobic exercise can help reduce attacks. As stress is a common trigger, deep breathing exercises, yoga, acupuncture and physiotherapy are also recommended. While Rachel's silent migraines have stopped taking over her life, she says they are of ten misunderstood. 'While I have always had good care from doctors, for a lot of people it is hard to understand aura and its impact,' she  says. 'For most people, a migraine involves a throbbing headache that lasts days. For me, the aura is always the worst symptom and while it is happening there is nothing that you can do but wait it out.'","Rachel Paskin, 42, from Aldridge, suffers from silent migraines - auras .

Pittsburgh officials warned of a public health crisis Sunday after a week in which 17 people died of overdoses on an unusually potent form of heroin. Three were declared dead Sunday morning alone from apparent heroin overdoses in Allegheny County and officials warn the situation now looks startlingly like the crisis of 1988 when 18 Pittsburghers were killed by a powerful synthetic heroin called China White. Many of those who died in the last week possessed heroin bags marked 'Theraflu' and subsequent tests revealed they contained a drug 100 times more powerful than morphine called fentanyl. Scroll down for video . Crisis: Officials say they've found these heroin bags stamped 'Theraflu' in possession of some of the over a dozen dead drug users who've died in the past week . 'The fentanyl we're seeing as a powder has to be made by somebody,' Allegheny County medical examiner Dr. Karl Williams told ABC News. 'Somebody is making this somewhere in a clandestine laboratory.' Fentanyl is manufactured as a legal pain killer, but authorities suspect the fentanyl that laced the heroin was made in an illegal lab 'by some clever chemists.' Allegheny county sees about one overdose case per day, Williams said. What's happened in the past week is extremely out of the ordinary. 'We usually deal with 250 drug overdoses a year so what’s going on is really significant,' he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Fentanyl resembles heroin, though it is much more potent, and it has been blamed for dozens of deaths around the U.S. Been here before? Found in some of the Theraflu bags was the super-potent narcotic Theraflu, which officials like Allegheny County medical examiner Dr. Karl Williams (right) says makes the recent rash of deaths eerily similar to the 1988 China White epidemic . China White: In 1988, 18 were killed in the Pittsburgh area by a drug called 3-methylfentanyl, a sort of synthetic heroin with the street name China White . Each of the people who died in the rash of overdoses has a known history of drug abuse, particularly heroin, Williams said. Deaths also have been reported in Westmoreland County, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto’s office said. The area has seen periodic rises in the overdose rate, notably in 1988 when a potent chemical called 3-methylfentanyl, AKA China White, was introduced to heroin users in the area, killing 18 of them. It remains to be seen if each of the recent victims died due to heroin laced with fentanyl. 'I don’t know yet what we’ll find in the bodies of these people,' Williams said, though something is clearly out there causing the steep rise in heroin-related deaths. 'We’re obviously dealing with a major public health crisis,' he said, something 'bringing to mind the very localized China White epidemic we had in 1988.'","Investigators have found many of the drug users possessed heroin bags labelled 'Theraflu'

As the FBI charged five alleged members of the New York mafia, including a suspect in the 1978 Lufthansa heist at JFK, an attorney joked about the case's Goodfellas connection. During a brief hearing at a Brooklyn court on Thursday, Vincent Asaro, the alleged leader of the Bonanno organized crime family, pleaded not guilty to robbery charges. After the hearing, his attorney Gerald McMahon said: 'I got a call from Martin Scorsese. He wants to do a sequel to Goodfellas and it seems that federal prosecutors are providing him with the script.' Defense: Vincent Asaro's attorney, Gerald McMahon, says his client will fight the charges . Arrest: Vincent Vinny Asaro, second from right, has been charged over the the infamous Lufthansa heist of 1978 . Asaro, 78, was charged with the theft of $5 . million in cash and $1 million in jewelry from the Lufthansa Terminal at . JFK airport on December 11, 1978. At . the time, it was the biggest cash heist ever in the U.S. The . stolen $5 million would be worth $17.9 million in 2013 dollars, . according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Four other men, who prosecutors claimed were members of the New York-based gang, were arrested for other crimes. 'Vincent Asaro devoted his adult life to the Bonanno crime family, with a criminal career that spanned decades,' U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. 'Neither age nor time dimmed Asaro's ruthless ways, as he continued to order violence to carry out mob business in recent months.' The attorney for Asaro, who has been held without bail, said he would fight the charges. Mr McMahon added that his client had been framed by shady turncoat gangsters, including former Bonanno boss Joseph Massino - the highest-ranking member of the city's five organized crime families to break the mob's vow of silence. Iconic: The multi-million dollar heist was made famous in the 1990 film Goodfellas . Massino 'is one of the worst witnesses I've ever seen,' Mr McMahon said. He added that Asaro had given him orders that 'there will be no plea and he will walk out the door a free man'. The gangsters involved in the infamous heist had . each been promised a $750,000 payment that most didn't get 'either . because they were killed first or it was never given to them,' according . to court papers filed in the Brooklyn court on Thursday. 'These ""goodfellas"" thought they had a license to steal, a license to kill, and a license to do whatever they wanted,' George Venizelos, FBI assistant director-in-charge, said. Asaro resented the non-payment, according to a 2011 recording made by a cooperating witness. 'We never got our right money, what we were supposed to get, we got f***ed all around,'  Asaro allegedly told the witness, according to the papers. 'That f***ng Jimmy [Burke] kept everything.' Burke, the suspected mastermind of the . heist, died in prison in 1996 while serving time for the murder of a . drug dealer. Actor Robert De Niro played a character based on Burke in . the film. 'A lot of the main characters, like Burke, either died, disappeared or were murdered,' said Anthony DeStefano, a veteran New York crime reporter and author of the 2013 book Vinny Gorgeous: The Ugly Rise and Fall of a New York Mobster. Charges: Vincent Asaro, an alleged captain in the Bonanno crime family, has denied allegations that he was involved in the robbert . A break in the case came after an FBI investigation of a New York property tied to Burke last summer turned up human remains. The Thursday indictment charges Asaro with the murder of Paul Katz in 1969, as well as robbery, conspiracy and other crimes tied to the 1978 heist. Asaro and Burke allegedly strangled Katz with a dog chain because they thought he was cooperating with investigators, prosecutors said. His body was first buried in the basement of a vacant house in the New York borough of Queens and later moved to the location where it was found last summer, they said. The papers also charge the men were involved in a 1981 arson at a building where a businessman had intended to open a nightclub catering to black people in the then mostly white neighborhood in Queens, where the accused gangsters socialized. The papers also mention a discussion between Asaro and the other indicted men about more recent crimes, including extortion, loan sharking and violence, as recently as 2013. Hearing: Thomas  DiFiore is one of five suspected mafia members arrested this week. He face extortion charges that are not related to the heist . Cuffed: Two of five men arrested by the FBI are pictured leaving a Brooklyn court . Asaro was charged with four criminal . counts, including robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery, in . connection with the Lufthansa heist. He is also charged racketeering and extortion for other alleged criminal activity. Vincent . Asaro and his son, Jerome Asaro, 55, are charged with stealing $1.25 . million in gold salts from a Federal Express employee in February 1984. They are also accused of robbery conspiracy in the theft of $1 million . from an armored car in the mid-1980s. Three . others defendants, Jack Bonventre, 45; Thomas 'Tommy D' Di Fiore, 70; . and John 'Bazoo' Ragano, 52, are charged with multiple crimes, including . racketeering and extortion, unrelated to the Lufthansa heist, officials . said. Jerome Asaro and . Ragano, wearing baggy sweatsuits and sneakers, pleaded not guilty to all . charges in Brooklyn on Thursday. Bonventre did not enter a plea as his . lawyer was not yet present. Di Fiore was not present in court. Much of the money from the 1978 heist has not been recovered, DeStefano, who writes for Newsday, said. 'Some . of it went up the chain in tribute to the Luccheses, some of it went to . Burke and his businesses and some of it is still unaccounted for,' he . claimed. Investigation: One of the five men arrested by the FBI is escorted by agents . The exact connection between the . search of Burke's home in Queens and the Lufthansa heist has not been . made clear by the FBI as of Thursday. Before . today the only person ever convicted in connection with the robbery was . airport insider, Louis Werner - who tipped off the men who stole the . money. The theft occurred . in the middle of the night on December 11, 1978 and netted the robbers . more than $5 million in cash and $1 million in jewels. At . the time, it was the largest heist ever in America and led to a decades-long search for the perpetrators.

Impassioned speech: Tim Cook called for equality for all in the deeply personal address after he received a lifetime achievement award from Auburn University at the United Nations in New York last week . Impassioned, Cook began the speech by describing how he witnessed the 'devastating impacts of discrimination,' growing up in 1960s Alabama. 'Remarkable people were denied opportunities and treated without basic human dignity solely because of the color of their skin,' he said, before recounting the moment he saw a cross burning on the front lawn of a nearby black family. 'This image was permanently imprinted in my brain and it would change my life forever,' he said. 'For me, the cross burning was a symbol of ignorance, of hatred and a fear of anyone different than the majority.

A New Jersey family auctioned the chance to name their ninth baby - with bids starting at $20,000. The family posted an advert on Craigslist in January and . suggested that prospective buyers may want to choose a name to honor a . relative or even a Holocaust victim. Despite the ad, the baby was named . Rina on Saturday-without the influence of any bidders. The Jewish family said they planned to use the money to help with school tuition fees and the cost of living in their home in Lakewood. Scroll down for video . This baby girl was named Rina on Saturday without the help of any Craigslist bidders . The ad (pictured here) has since been taken down from Craigslist for violating the terms of service . The name Rina is the Hebrew word for 'joy'. After the peculiar ad was posted, it was removed from Craigslist for violating the terms of service. The man who wrote the ad contacted the Jewish News service JTA.org to say that his ad was indeed a real offer. NJ.com reports that the family got four offers before the ad was removed. The father wrote in his ad, 'This is an excellent opportunity for someone who did not have children, or someone looking to honor a relative, or even to honor someone who was killed in the Holocaust.' The JTA interviewed the father who identified himself as a schoolteacher from Lakewood. When asked what the family would do with the $20,000, he said he would use the funds to support his child. The father explained that tuition in Lakewood and rent is quite expensive. This is the family's ninth daughter and the family already used family names for their other children. The family said they would like a baby name and a secular name but wouldn't accept 'crazy names' like 'Box'. They say they'd prefer something Biblical. When a Jewish baby is given a name, family and friends gather for a small ceremony . In the Jewish tradition, children receive both a biblical name and a secular name because one is used for religious purposes and ceremonies and the other is used in the everyday world. Family and friends hold a small baby naming ceremony. If the baby is a boy, he will be circumcised. The family originally said they would treat whomever named their daughter like a loved member of the family. 'We’d stay in touch with her, invite her to the bat mitzvah, wedding, say Kaddish for them after 120 years,' said the father. JTA interviewed the father and asked him why he came up with the idea to post an ad on Craigslist. 'About four or five years ago, I remember hearing in the news that someone else did the same thing. We’re a little rushed; we’d like to name the baby on Saturday. We tried to post it to eBay, but it was a little more complicated than we thought, so we posted it on Craigslist,' he said. The father asked JTA to put out a press release saying he is auctioning the right to sell his daughter's name. The JTA offered help by setting up an email address for readers to send their naming suggestions but the family decided to come up with their own original name for their little bundle of 'joy'.","Despite the Craigslist ad, the baby was named Rina which means 'joy' in Hebrew, independently of any bidders .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 08:38 EST, 27 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:26 EST, 27 January 2014 . Forget being sneezed on: Government scientists are deliberately giving dozens of volunteers the flu by squirting the live virus straight up their noses. It may sound bizarre, but the rare type of research is a step in the quest for better flu vaccines. It turns out that how the body fends off influenza remains something of a mystery. 'Vaccines are working, but we could do better,' said Dr Matthew Memoli of the National Institutes of Health, who is leading the study that aims to infect up to 100 adults over the next year. Contagion: Test patient Daniel Bennett, 26, is sprayed with a live flu virus as part of a study at the National Institutes of Health to improve vaccines against the seasonal illness . Wait a minute: Flu is sweeping the country, so why not just study the already sick? That wouldn't let scientists measure how the immune system reacts through each step of infection, starting with that first exposure to the virus. It's not an experiment to be taken lightly. After all, the flu kills thousands of Americans a year. For safety, Memoli chose a dose that produces mild to moderate symptoms — and accepts only volunteers who are healthy and no older than 50. And to avoid spreading the germs, participants must spend at least nine days quarantined inside a special isolation ward at the NIH hospital, their health closely monitored. They're not released until nasal tests prove they're no longer contagious. The incentive: About $3,000 to compensate for their time. Room for improvement: Dr Matthew Memoli is leading the study at the NIH. He says that while current vaccines are working, 'we could do better' 'I received a very scolding email from my mother' about signing up, Daniel Bennett, 26, said with a grin. 'Their standards are so high, I don't believe I'm in danger,' added Bennett, a restaurant worker from College Park, Md. 'I don't get sick that often.' A masked and gloved Memoli had Bennett lie flat for about a minute. 'It will taste salty. Some will drip down the back of your throat,' Memoli said, before squeezing a syringe filled with millions of microscopic virus particles, floating in salt water, into each nostril. Sure enough, a few days later Bennett had the runny nose and achiness of mild flu. The best defense against influenza is a yearly vaccine, but it's far from perfect. In fact, the vaccine is least effective in people age 65 and older — the group most susceptible to flu — probably because the immune system weakens with age. Deadly: While non-fatal in most cases, the flu still kills thousands of Americans a year. Above, Dr Memoli handles doses of the live virus . Understanding how younger adults' bodies fight flu may help scientists determine what the more vulnerable elderly are missing, clues to help develop more protective vaccines for everyone, Memoli explained. Symptoms: A few days after getting sprayed with the virus, Bennett started to experience a runny nose and achiness . Here's the issue: The vaccine is designed to raise people's levels of a particular flu-fighting antibody. It targets a protein that acts like the virus' coat, called hemagglutinin — the 'H' in H1N1, the strain that caused the 2009 pandemic and that is causing the most illness so far this winter, too. But it's not clear what antibody level is best to aim for — or whether a certain amount means you're protected against getting sick at all, or that you'd get a mild case instead of a severe one. 'As mind-boggling as it is, we don't know the answer to that,' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 'We made some assumptions that we knew everything about flu.' Just targeting hemagglutinin probably isn't enough, Memoli added. Already, some people in his study didn't get sick, despite remarkably low antibody levels, meaning something else must be protecting them. Could it be antibodies against the 'N' in flu's name, the neuraminidase protein? Specific T cells that are activated to fight infection? Genes that switch on and off when a virus invades? To begin finding out, Memoli first developed a laboratory-grown copy of the H1N1 flu strain and sprayed different amounts into volunteers' noses until he found the right dose to trigger mild flu. He hopes eventually to test the harsher H3N2 strain, too. Now he's infecting two groups — people with low antibody levels and those with high levels. Some were recently vaccinated, and some weren't. He'll compare how sick they get, how long they're contagious and how the immune system jumps into action. Called a human challenge study, this kind of research hasn't been performed with flu viruses in the U.S. for more than a decade, before scientists had ways as sophisticated to measure what happens. Easy enough: Bennett said he spent most of his time sick with the flu studying, watching TV and playing games with the other study participants . 'It's all going to add up to a better understanding of what you need to have to be protected against the flu,' said Dr. John Treanor, a flu specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center who is closely watching the work. So far, Memoli's patients are becoming contagious a day or two before they start feeling bad, one reason the flu spreads so easily. He sees a range of symptoms, from sniffles to a few days of moderate fever, fatigue and congestion. Bennett's flu was pretty mild, and he passed the time studying, watching TV and playing games with the four other study participants infected this month. 'All I had to do was read and watch movies, so it wasn't that terrible,' Bennett said. 'It was a really cool experience' to see how research is done.","Researchers are exposing volunteers to the live virus in order to study the virus from infection .

A father who has been diagnosed with cancer has vowed to write 800 notes for his daughter so that she has one in her lunch box every day until she leaves high school. Garth Callaghan, 44, from Glen Allen, Virginia, has been writing short messages on napkins for his daughter Emma, 14, since she was in kindergarten - and now she looks forward to them every day. So after Mr Callaghan was diagnosed with cancer three times in the past two years - kidney cancer twice and prostate cancer once - he realized that, if he lost his battle with the disease, he never wanted her to go without. Now he is on a mission to write 800 of the notes - which are each compiled on simple white napkins and popped in her lunch bag - in case he doesn't reach her graduation. Close: Garth Callaghan has been writing his daughter Emma napkin notes since she was in kindergarten . The note-writing has long been a tradition between the father and daughter; it began when Callaghan worked a busy sales job in her elementary school days and wouldn't see her often. So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Callaghan would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box. But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, she'd come to expect the notes. Some days, she would look at her lunch before he had placed on inside, and she'd demand to know where it was, he told the Times-Dispatch last year. Determined: After learning he had cancer, he sought to write 800 notes so that she'd have one every day throughout high school - even if he was no longer alive to put it in her lunch box . Words of encouragement: He uses quotes from famous people or simply jots words of love to Emma . 'That's when I realized, this is something that really matters,' he said. Callaghan's wife, Lissa, said the task also means he's taken over the chore of making his daughter's lunch, which he tries to keep healthy. 'I think it's great,' she said. 'It's nice that he keeps that connection with her.' But in 2011, he was diagnosed with cancer and his desire to write the notes became even stronger because, 'at the end of the day, these notes might be the only thing my daughter has left of me'. His tumor was successfully removed - but he has since been diagnosed twice more, and his doctor has told him that he will lose his life to the disease. If . he doesn't win his fight against cancer, he's hopeful that the words of . people like Eleanor Roosevelt, Gandhi and Audrey Hepburn will provide . her some guidance. Giving back: Emma has started writing her father notes back, such as: 'An arrow can only be shot by pulling it backwards so when life is dragging you back, it means it's going to launch you into something awesome' Thankful: Garth responded with a thank you note, saying: 'I love the person you are!' Lunchtime treat: He pops the notes in with her lunch, which he tries to make as nutritious as he can . 'Today, I am NED â€“ No Evidence of . Disease,' he told Metro. 'I still likely have cancer, but we canâ€™t see . it. That's the irony. I am actually ok, and I feel well.' Emma has been saving some of the notes in a composition book and now sends back her own. 'An . arrow can only be shot by pulling it backwards, so when life is . dragging you back, it means itâ€™s going to launch you into something . awesome,' she wrote to her father recently. She told the Times Dispatch that she tries her hardest not to look at the note until lunch time. 'It helps me to have something to look forward to,' she said. Mr Callaghan shares the notes he writes Emma on Facebook and his website. Devoted to Emma: Garth is pictured with Emma, his and his wife's only child, in her younger years .

Victim: Sofia Liu, 6, died after being struck by a driver who was waiting to pick up an Uber client on New Year's Eve . Car service app Uber is now facing its first major legal hurdle after being named in a wrongful death lawsuit after one of its drivers hit and killed a 6-year-old girl. Sofia Liu died on New Year's Eve after an Uber driver, Syad Muzaffar, hit her and injured her mother and brother. The suit was filed in San Francisco today meaning the company faces its first true test as it argues that they are not responsible for the driver since he did not have an Uber customer in the vehicle at the time of the accident. Uber is an app that allows users to call a car to their location, and drivers can log into the service whenever they want to receive clients. The 'free market' approach to this issue is important because it is up to the drivers when they want to participate- as opposed to a typical livery company where the drivers clock in and clock out at set times. Instead, the only similar aspect that the company has is the fact that drivers are technically 'logged in' to the Uber app from the moment they put themselves on the virtual map for users to call them. The larger question that looms over the wrongful death case is who should be in charge of regulating Uber? And when does the company stop being responsible- or, in this case, start being responsible- for the behavior of their drivers, who essentially work on a freelance basis? Mr Muzaffar had been working for the company for one month at the time of the accident, at which point he was arrested for suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and cooperated with the police throughout the investigation. Scroll down for video . Responsibility: The driver, Syad Muzaffar (left), was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, but lawyer Chris Dolan (right) argues that the company was negligent because of how they made the app in the first place . Technical case: Uber drivers are required to be 'logged in' to the device even when they don't have a client in the car, and it is not hands-free compatible meaning that it could be seen as breaking California law . He owns the Honda Pilot that he was driving, and he considered his work for Uber to be his full time job. Even . though Mr Muzaffar's income from Uber was his main livelihood, the . company did not view or treat him any differently from other drivers- . some of whom may work for a number of car services at the same time. The company maintains that the use of the app does not make them liable, but the victim's mother believes it does. The New York Times reports . that the family's lawyer, Chris Dolan, argues in the suit that the app . does is not compatible with hands-free technology, meaning that while . the drivers are logged in- responding to a taxi request or simply . waiting until they get a call- they are unable to use a hands-free tool. Drawing a line: The company's co-founder Travis Kalanick, seen here in Sydney in 2012, says that the company is not responsible for the drivers using their app when they do not have a passenger in the car . 'Uberâ€™s claims that they are not responsible for injuries caused by Uber drivers who are logged on to the system but not carrying a fare flies in the face of hundreds of years of law,' Mr Dolan told the paper. 'New technology does not eliminate well-established legal principles.' The family is suing Uber and the driver, Mr Muzzafar, for wrongful death, negligence, negligent hiring, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. 'Cabdrivers who are looking for fares are scanning the streets. Uber drivers looking for fares are looking at their phones,' Mr Dolan said. One of the lawsuit's main points is that Uber's parent company 'is the insurance certificate holder for the insurance that Uber is required to carry as a Transportation Network Company by the (Public Utilities Commission), which it uses for its Uber X operations'. They are calling for a jury trial and have not set an amount of compensation that they hope to be awarded. Grieving: The Lius are suing Uber and the driver, Mr Muzzafar, for wrongful death, negligence, negligent hiring, and negligent infliction of emotional distress . Travis Kalanick, the man who founded Uber four years ago, got 'testy' when questioned about the case in an earlier New York Times interview. This is not the only public relations issue that Uber faces at the moment, but after it was valued at $4billion, the co-founders are taking each threat to their power as a serious concern. He would not speak about the case specifically- likely for legal reasons- but said that the company has since deactivated Muzaffarâ€™s account and he has not been able to drive any other Uber clients ever since the accident. 'We work our butts off to go above and beyond what is expected even by the regulators, including insurance, background checks,' Mr Kalanick said. 'And so it always comes back to, did Uber do something wrong?'","Car service app is now facing a wrongful death lawsuit after an accident ended with 6-year-old Sofia Liu dead and her mother and brother injured .

An openly gay journalist was brutally beaten in Midtown earlier this month and the incident is now being investigated as a hate crime. A candlelight vigil was held on Sunday night for the award winning arts journalist Randy Gener, 45, who has worked for The New York Times, The New York Daily News, American Theater Magazine, and NPR to name a few. CBS reports that Randy was on his way home from a Broadway show premiere party early on January 17 when he was attacked near West 54 street and Seventh Avenue, just a few minutes away from his apartment. Police also believe the assault could have been a so-called 'knockout game' attack. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Randy Gener is an award winning journalist who has written for The New York Times, The Daily News, and NPR . The suspect: A Hispanic male in his 20s who is 6 ft tall and weighs approximately 160 pounds was last seen wearing black jeans and a black jacket . Boyculture.com reports that the NYPD just released information about the possible attacker. He is described as a Hispanic male in his 20s who is approximately 160 lbs with short black hair. He was last seen wearing black jeans and a black jacket. The suspect allegedly punched Gener in the face then fled the scene by quickly jumping into a grey four door Nissan with the Mississippi license plate #KAT397. Last night's vigil took place near the scene of the unfortunate attack. The vigil had two purposes: one purpose was to commemorate Gener and the other purpose was to put put pressure on NYPD to capture the suspect. 'Three more minutes he would have been in his own bed,' Randy's partner Stephen Nisbet said to CBS. 'He got hit really hard on the head so he suffered traumatic brain injuries,' Nisbet said. Gener has undergone brain surgery at St.Lukes hospital and is scheduled to have another operation. Gener's friend Liz Casasola told CBS that Gener is, 'coming in and out of consciousness, and he is not quite aware of whatâ€™s going on.' Randy was attacked just moments before he would have arrived back at his apartment . Family and friends hope that Randy Gener will have a speedy recovery from his 'traumatic brain injury' Friends and Family attended a vigil to honor their friend and to put pressure on the NYPD to find a suspect . 'Heâ€™s always there for everyone in the theater and Filipino community, . itâ€™s hard to picture it happening to someone like him,' Casasola continued. Genr's sister Jessica Blair- Driessler told reporters that his recovery may last up to six months or a year. A source who wished to remain anonymous said that police are investigating the possibility of Gener's attack as part of 'the knockout game' in which brutal attacks such as Gener's are unsolicited and performed at random. NYPD have also brought in the hate crime team to investigate the assault which took place near Broadway, where Gener was attending a theater premiere. This reporter, who met Randy Gener years ago while interning at Theatre Communications Group where he was employed by American Theater Magazine, remembers Gener as a warm and welcoming colleague dedicated to making people laugh. The Mail Online spoke with Martha Neighbors, a close friend and former colleague of Gener's. 'Randy is one of the great minds, and the thought that his beautiful brain is damaged in a truly senseless and appalling attack is just too much to bear. No one, anywhere at any time, should be subject to physical or verbal assault for being who they are. This has to stop,' she said.

David Cameron has spared the blushes of Francois Hollande after agreeing an Anglo-French summit this week will not include spouses. While Samantha Cameron is often seen at the Prime Minister’s side, Mr Hollande is without a First Lady after revelations he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet. As the French President’s former First Lady Valerie Trierweiler conducted a high profile tour of India, Downing Street insisted partners are not invited to Friday’s event. Awkward: Downing Street insisted there would be no role for spouses when David Cameron hosts French President Francois Hollande for a summit this week . Valerie Trierweiler told journalists she doesn't know what she will do now she is no longer France's First Lady - but she has some time to decide . Mr Hollande is due in the UK on Friday for the summit, a week after his split from first Miss Trierweiler was announced formally. He officially ‘fired’ her on Saturday – signalling the end of her time as  first lady in a curt 18-word statement. The Paris Match magazine journalist’s charity trip to India will certainly be the last she enjoys with all the trappings of a VIP dignitary. Mr Hollande has made it clear that he wants her to return to ordinary life, staying away from the Elysee Palace and living in the modest flat they once shared in Paris’s unfashionable 15th arrondissement. Mr Hollande, who had never married, is now expected to remain a ‘bachelor president’ for a while, while continuing with his relationship with Ms Gayet outside the Elysee. Ms Gayet has not spoken since the pictures were published of Mr Hollande leaving their Paris love nest on the back of a moped, while using a crash helmet as a poor disguise. Happier times: Francois Hollande and Valerie Trierweiler on the night he was elected French president . Friends have indicated that she wants financial compensation from the President, who fears that she will turn into a loose cannon who could damage him. Mr Cameron is hosting the summit at RAF Brize Norton, the air force base in his Oxfordshire constituency. Energy and defence policy are expected to dominate talks on Friday morning, with senior ministers from both sides of the Channel expected to take part. Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande will also eat lunch together, but without their other halves. ‘I do not think there is a spouses' programme, no,’ Mr Cameron's official spokesman told reporters. In June 2010 Mr Cameron and wife Samantha hosted then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni for lunch in 10 Downing Street . Tony and Cherie Blair welcomed French President Jacques Chirac and his wife Bernadette to Downing Street in 2004 . Number 10 also confirmed that there would be a summit press conference. ‘There will be an opportunity to ask questions,’ the spokesman said. French journalists were widely criticised for their failure to grill Mr Hollande about his affair when he gave a press conference in Paris days after details of his trysts emerged.","No.10 says Friday's talks at RAF Brize Norton will not involve partners .

Senator Charles Schumer has proposed a new law that would fit autistic children with GPS tracking chips . A U.S. senator has proposed a new law in the name of the disabled teenager who was found dead in New York earlier this month, which would fit autistic children with tracking devices. Charles Schumer said ‘Avonte’s Law’- named after autistic 14-year old Avonte Oquendo, who died after wandering out of the confines of his Long Island City school on October 4 - would make it easier for authorities to find children with the disability who had gone astray. Under the proposed legislation, a state-funded voluntary scheme would see children’s clothes fitted with a small GPS system. Standing with Avonte’s mother, Vanessa Fontaine, and grandmother, Doris McCoy, on Sunday, Senator Schumer said the family was going through a “nightmare” and that steps needed to be taken to prevent a similar incident happening again. Avonte, who had a form of autism that made him nonverbal, had been missing since October 4, when he walked out of his school toward a park overlooking a river. His body was found about 11 miles from where he vanished in New York’s East River earlier this month after his disappearance sparked a massive citywide search that saw volunteers join forces with police. In a program that would cost around $10 million and be overseen by the Justice Department, schools and parents would be issued with tiny GPS chips. Currently in the US a similar system is used for locating Alzheimer sufferers. 'There is no reason the same program that's been successful with elderly people with Alzheimer's who wander cannot be used for kids like Avonte who have autism and wander,' Senator Schumer said in New York in remarks carried by The Wall Street Journal. 'The only barrier is the funding.' David Perecman, the lawyer for Avonte’s family, backed the proposal which he said could save lives. Hundreds of grieving relatives, friends and sympathetic strangers came together Saturday for a funeral marking the tragic end of a three-month search for the missing autistic New York City teen. The former Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, Cardinal Edward Egan, presided over the ceremony at the Church of Saint Joseph as Avonte's parents and brothers sat stoically in a front pew, next to a white casket holding the remains of the body pulled from the East River. ‘This morning we are grateful to God for Avonte Oquendo, for his life, for his courage, and for the acts of goodness and kindness that his life and his tragic disappearance evoked among us,’ Egan said. ‘We know that he is safely in the embrace of the father in heaven and we thank that father in heaven for the years we had with him in our midst.’ Somber closure: Avonte Oquendo's mother Vanessa Fontaine seen through the casket of her son, Avonte, as it is brought out of Saint Joseph's Church in the West Village after a memorial service .

Gone forever: Avonte had been missing since October 4, when he walked out of his school toward a park overlooking the river, setting off a massive three-month search involving hundreds of volunteers . Keeping the faith: Former Archbishop of New York Cardinal Edward Egan, who presided over the service, said Avonte in now in the embrace of the father in heaven . Outpouring of support: Dozens of the volunteers who handed out flyers with Avonte's picture on them and helped the search effort were on hand at the church Saturday . Act of charity: Greenwich Village Funeral Home covered the costs of the service and a family-only wake . A . funeral home covered the costs of the service and a family-only wake . beforehand, where about a hundred relatives sat together in a room full . of white flowers watching a slideshow of the teen's photos. ‘Nobody . really wanted to speak,’ said Roberto Colon, 49, whose wife's cousin is . Avonte's mother. ‘We couldn't fathom what to say.’ Vanessa Fontaine wept through the entire service, and neither she nor Avonte's other relatives spoke. 'It was like complete silence, it was very sad,' family friend Leslie Burch told the New York Daily News. Actress . and one-time Celebrity Apprentice star Holly Robinson Peete, who has an . autistic child of her own, flew out to New York City from California to . attend Avonte's funeral.

One last kiss: Avonte's father Danny Oquendo kisses his son's casket . 'Headed to NYC to celebrate the life of another angel,' she tweeted to her 400,000 followers hours before the service. Investigators are still trying to determine how Avonte died and further tests are needed to determine the cause and manner of death, officials have said. Mr Perecman filed a notice of claim in October, the first step in suing the city, and has publically listed a number of mistakes he alleges contributed to the boy's disappearance and what he has described as a flawed search effort. The city's law department has called the boy's death a tragedy and said its attorneys will review a lawsuit when it's filed. Heartbreaking task: An NYPD dive unit searches for Avonte's remains after an arm and legs were discovered along a rocky shoreline in Queens January 17 . Case solved: The child's remains, including a skull, were found about 11 miles from where he vanished . Margaret Coaxume, who did not know Avonte or his family, brought her 15-year-old autistic son Elijah Thompson to the funeral because, she said, like so many she had closely followed the heartbreaking story of Avonte's disappearance and death. ‘It's a tragedy,’ she said, as mourners placed white roses on the casket inside a hearse that was to take Avonte's body to a crematorium after the service. ‘My heart is heavy.'","Senator Charles Schumer proposes new bill after death of Avonte Oquendo .

The First Lady always brings a group of apolitical Americans to the annual speech with her to highlight their service and achievements throughout the year. Some will be recognized by many and this year one of those men will be Carlos Arredondo, who was wearing a white cowboy hat as he rushed a stranger- later identified as Jeff Bauman- to get medical treatment after he lost both legs in the blast.

The iconic picture of Mr Arrendondo rushing Bauman to first responders became a hopeful symbol of the devastating attack. The White House said that the two men have become close friends. Heroes of the Boston Marathon bombing, a firefighter who led the rescue response to an Oklahoma tornado, and an openly gay basketball player will be among U.S. first lady Michelle Obama's guests at the State of the Union address on Tuesday.

A boat used by the U.S. Navy for target practice broke free from its mooring and drifted 4,000 miles across the Atlantic - eventually landing on a quiet beach in Cornwall. The orange boat, known as a Low-Cost Tow Target, started its epic journey in Florida and is believed to have been cut off from its towing vessel, possibly by gunfire, on January 2 2013. Over the next year it drifted east across the Atlantic before it was spotted by a man walking his dog on picturesque Perranporth beach on the North Cornish coast on Friday. Epic journey: A United States Navy target boat broke adrift off the coast of Florida and washed up on a beach on the North Cornish coast a year later . Rightful owner: The U.S. Navy tag on the stern of the target boat . The St Agnes Coastguard rushed out as the boat was capsized and could have been a sailor in distress . As they arrived it was washing up on the beach and at first the crew had no idea what the vessel was. They scraped barnacles away from a sticker and were surprised to discover it belonged to the American military. 'I've never seen anything like this before in the 10 years I've been a coastguard. It's in remarkably good condition,' said Station Officer Ivor Thomson. It drifted east across the Atlantic for more than a year before it was spotted by a man walking his dog on the beach . One member of the Coastguard said he had never seen anything like it in 10 years . Castaway: The boat may have broken free during a live fire exercise . 'It's lucky it ended up on the beach, a mile either way and it would have been on the rocks and smashed to splinters. 'I think it's pretty amazing it came all this way completely unassisted. We had no idea what it was, we wondered whether it was something dangerous.' HM Coastguard at Falmouth let the U.S. Navy know they'd found the boat. Perhaps unsurprisingly, American officers don't want it back. The boat is now expected to be disposed of by North Devon Council. Target ships are vessels used for naval gunnery practice or for weapons testing. Often they are obsolete or captured warships, but some are built from scratch. The boat that was washed ashore in North Cornwall is believed to be a Low-Cost Tow Target. It is usually towed by a HSMST (High Speed Manoeuverable Surface Target). It is an inexpensive alternative to state-of-the-art unmanned drone targets. The U.S. Navy also employs the Low-Cost Modular Target (LCMT), a modular barge made from pontoons, scaffolding and large coloured sails, which can be shot at with guns or a variety of missiles. Perhaps the most spectacular and famous example of the use of seaborne targets was Operation Crossroads, where 95 target ships were hit by two nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946.","The boat floated across the sea for a year before it was spotted on a beach .

'I looked behind to see who it was and got a bit of a shock,' Dr Grant told Radio New Zealand. 'I am not sure how effective (the knife) was. I guess it let go so something must have happened, put a few nicks in it.' The creature retreated and he was able to swim to rocks. It was not until he removed his wetsuit that he released he had been bitten. Dr Grant then calmly stitched up his wounds, which were up to 5cm long, using a first aid kit he kept in his vehicle for pig hunts.

The Better Business Bureau today warned the unexpected charges are a clear sign the consumers card number is being used by crooks. Those who investigated the charge were send to a page offering 'customer support' - which was also part of the scam. A major new credit card scam has been uncovered  claiming to offer ' customer support' and making charges of $9.84 to accounts. A series of small payments, usually for $9.84, are made to stolen card numbers. The source listed on the bill is an unfamiliar website. The web address leads to a generic landing page that claims to offer 'Customer Support.' The text promises to 'refund 100% of your last payment' and provides a phone number and email address - but payments are never returned. 'With this new con, scammers are banking on the fact that many consumers don’t check their credit card statements all that carefully,' the Better Business Bureau warns. 'Don’t fall for it. 'Review your recent statements for unexplained charges of $9.84 and contest them with your bank or credit card issuer (call the number on the back of your card).' The scam is designed to play on the fact many consumers do not check their statements thoroughly. By putting through small amounts for generic terms such as customer support, the scammers hope the transaction will go unnoticed. 'The expectation is that many cardholders won’t notice the relatively . small charge, and the credit card companies won’t go after such a minor . sum,' the Better Business Bureau says. Some victims even report calling the 'customer support' site and receiving verbal confirmation that the charge would be canceled - but the refund does not appear. The bureau advises people to cancel their card immediately should they be concerned. Users affected by the scam are advised to cancel their cards immediately . 'Your card card information has been compromised, and it’s likely scammers will be back for more,' they say. The fraud, uncovered by a former Washington Post reporter who writes an investigative blog called KrebsOnSecurity, apparently relies on consumer carelessness. It is believed to be connected to the recent huge haul of credit card numbers from Target's web site . Hackers reportedly stole tens of millions of customers' personal information, including their names, mailing addresses, phone numbers and email addresses from several retailers. Target was worst hit, as around 70 million Target customers had their information stolen. Krebs writes in his blog that the charges, most of which were reported over the holiday season, may have been spotted because consumers are being more vigilant in the wake of the Target breach. 'It’s still not clear how consumers’ card numbers are being stolen here, but the fraud appears to stem from an elaborate network of affiliate schemes that stretch from Cyprus to India and the United Kingdom,' he wrote.","Alert issued over scam payments claiming to be web site customer support .

Millionaire Chinese businessmen wanting to settle in the UK has led to a surge in the number of British visas given to wealthy foreigners from outside the EU. Investor visas issued to the wealthy Chinese jumped from 95 to 171, for Americans from 19 to 66 and for Russians from 99 to 125. The visas allow migrants to invest £1 million, £5 million or £10 million in government bonds or British business. The rise in those issued to Chinese millionaires comes after David Cameron, on a trade trip to Beijing last month, encouraged Chinese entrepreneurs to put their cash in the UK. The number of investor visas issued to wealthy foreigners has jumped 25%, with demand from the wealthy Chinese leading the surge . 'If you are investing in Britain, . invest more,' the Prime Minister told Chinese businessmen and women. 'If you . are thinking of investing in Britain, come and find us. You will get a . warm welcome.' In . return for investing their millions, wealthy foreigners get permission . to apply for permanent residency in five, three or two years . respectively. After being allowed to settle permanently, investors may apply to become British citizens. The visa figures were disclosed by Pinsent Masons law firm following a Freedom of Information request. Visas issued to wealthy Chinese jumped from 95 to 71. They come to Britain because they feel their wealth is better protected in a democratic and transparent country. They show investor visas jumped from 423 in 2011-12 to 530 in 2012-13. In addition to the 530 investor visas, 1,038 visas were issued for applicants' dependents. The number of investor visas issued to Egyptians nearly doubled to 19. Applicants need not speak English and may bring their spouses and dependents to study or work. Investor visas are an increasingly popular way for wealthy individuals to obtain UK residency. To . qualify, the applicant must have at least £1m of their own funds, which . must be invested within three months of arriving in the UK. Shopping in Oxford Street, these Chinese women pose with their purchases from Selfridges' Boxing Day sale in Oxford Street . Unlike other categories of visa, individuals applying for an investor visa do not need to meet an English language requirement, and are able to bring their spouse and dependents to the UK to work or study. Direct investment in UK businesses creates thousands of new jobs every year. However, . an inquiry by the Migration Advisory Committee, which counsels the . Government, found that most using the investor visa route bought gilts . that Britain did not need when the Treasury is selling £300 million of . gilts every day to fund the deficit. Sir David Metcalf, chairman . of the committee, said that wealthy investors sometimes held the gilts . for five years and then sold them. This effectively amounted to making a loan to gain indefinite leave to stay in the country. Chinese . investors now make up the largest group of all successful applications, . accounting for 32% of all investor visas issued this year. Investors from the USA received 12% of all visas issued. Britain benefits from the thriving Chinese economy, with Chinese shoppers flocking to London and millionaires coming to invest their cash . Jill Turner, senior associate at Pinsent Masons, says: 'High Net Worth Individuals continue to pick the UK over other major international cities as they seek a safe haven for wealth.''The UK benefits from a very stable, liquid economy, and is free from any governmental interference in the assets of private individuals or any political instability. 'The UK government is also pro-business, with relatively low tax rates imposed on businesses and London has a reputation for being more welcoming of foreign nationals who benefit from the favourable tax environment. 'By contrast, China and Russia has a fairly volatile stock and . housing market that can make it a risky place to invest, and many of the . Chinese investors who flock to the UK feel that their wealth is better . protected in a democratic country.' The Peking pound: these shoppers from Chengdu, Sichaun province in China come to London to experience the delights of Oxford Street . For US investors, the booming Silicon Roundabout is a major attraction. Many American investors have expertise in the IT and technology in their own country, and want to capitalise on the growing high-tech sector in the UK. The number of investor visas issued to Egyptian nationals has nearly doubled in the last year, from just 10 visas issued last year to 19 this year. Political and economic instability in Egypt has prompted many wealthy families to divert their funds into the UK. Even the recent announcement that the Government will be charging Capital Gains Tax on the sale of properties owned by foreign investors from April 2015 isn’t discouraging foreign investment into the UK property market. Ms Turner says: 'High Net Worth Individuals continue to be attracted to the UK to invest in property, especially at the moment with house prices and rents soaring.' 'While the Capital Gains Tax levy may discourage some smaller investors from investing in UK property, the majority will not be put off by the charges.'","Special visas for rich foreigners rises 25% .

Because the injection creates a red spot, they painted a corresponding dot on the opposite arm so both looked identical to the brain. Scratching the itchy arm produced relief, while scratching the other one did not. Next, they placed a large vertical mirror in front of the itchy arm, blocking off the subject's view of their right arm and reflecting back the non-itchy one in its place. They asked the volunteers to look only at the reflected limb in the mirror, whilst a member of the team again scratched each arm. This time the participants felt relief when the unaffected, reflected arm was scratched. Christoph Helmchen and his colleagues at the University of Lübeck in Germany found that a similar mirror illusion can fool people into feeling relief from an itch, even when they scratch the wrong place. They found that although the effect was about 25% as effective as a 'real' scratch, the effect still brought relief. 'In both experiments, scratching the non-itching limb attenuated perceived itch intensity significantly and selectively in the mirror condition, i.e., when the non-itching forearm was visually perceived as the itching limb,' the researchers concluded. 'This effect might be due to a transient illusionary intersensory perceptual congruency of visual, tactile and pruriceptive signals. ''Mirror scratching' might provide an alternative treatment to reduce itch perception in focal skin diseases with persistent pruritus without causing additional harm to the affected skin and might therefore have significant clinical impact.' The team injected the right forearms of 26 male volunteers with itch-inducing chemical histamine. Because the injection creates a red spot, they painted a corresponding dot on the opposite arm so both looked identical. The researchers injected the right forearms of 26 male volunteers with itch-inducing chemical histamine as part of the experiment,  then put them in front of large mirrors to test their responses. One of the researchers then scratched each arm in turn. Scratching the itchy arm produced relief, while scratching the other one did not. Next, they placed a large vertical mirror in front of the itchy arm, blocking off the subject's view of their right arm and reflecting back the non-itchy one in its place. They asked the volunteers to look only at the reflected limb in the mirror, whilst a member of the team again scratched each arm. This time the participants felt relief when the unaffected, reflected arm was scratched. Although the effect was relatively weak – the relief from mirror scratching is about a quarter of that from scratching the real itch – the study shows that visual signals to the brain can override messages from the body if there is a mismatch between them. Francis McGlone at Liverpool John Moores University, UK, told New Scientist the finding could lead to treatments for chronic itching – a debilitating but poorly understood condition in which patients will often scratch their skin until it bleeds. 'This paper adds important insights into the complex mechanisms underlying itch – an often ignored sensory channel, but one that can have devastating consequences on quality of life for patients,' he said.","German researchers found brain can be manipulated into thinking it is scratching an itch - even though people were scratching the opposite side of the body .

A New Jersey man who was sentenced to nine months prison stemming from a marijuana possession charge has been given permission by the sentencing judge to leave jail for 10 days each month to go to Califonia... to smoke marijuana. Ed Forchion, 49, is a marijuana activist and cancer patient who has been legally cleared to receive marijuana for medical reasons in California. Despite the fact that New Jersey has since passed laws legalizing medical marijuana, he still has to leave Burlington County Jail and travel to California to receive his cannabis. Bad fortune: Ed Forchion is serving a staggered sentence of 270 days in 20-day intervals with 10 days off in between to travel to California for cancer treatment - which includes medical marijuana . Forchion, whose multiple attempts to legally change his name to NJWeedman.com have so far been unsuccessful, has been in and out of prison over the past two decades for his dedication to the cannabis cause. His latest imprisonment, he says, is 'punishment for being outspoken, and right.' He is suffering from a rare bone cancer that causes him to experience painful giant cell tumors and cancerous lesions. Every month, Forchion is permitted to fly to California for bone cancer treatment, which includes access to  medical marijuana which helps with his pain and has also been shown to shrink and slow the growth of his tumors. Advocate: Forchion has been a marijuana activist for 20 years, pushing for legalization in the U.S., and particular his home state New Jersey, where medical marijuana was recently legalized . Personal politics: Forchion, AKA NJWeedman.com, says he's being punished for 'being outspoken, and being right' 'I’m clearly a marijuana patient. The judge will let me out to go to California, knowing I’m going to get marijuana as soon as I walk out the door,' Forchion told NJ.com in November. 'I go to California, where I’m treated like a patient for a few days, then I have to turn around and go back to prison.' Although New Jersey's third medical marijuana facility opened in Woodbridge in December, Forchion says that 'it still takes a year for a patient to actually get his card and then get on the list.' 'There are patients who have had their card for over a year now who still don’t have access to medical marijuana from the programs that are already open,' he told My9NJ. In a December press conference, Governor Christie told reporters that he is 'not open to' a bill allowing registered medical marijuana patients in New Jersey to purchase cannabis in a state where it's been legalized and bring it back to New Jersey. Forchion, who has been vocal in his . opposition to New Jersey mayor Chris Christie, has himself had a tilt at . public office more than once, running for Governor of New Jersey, . Congress and the Senate on legalization platforms. Most recently, he has . been running his 'Just Say No to Governor Christie' campaign from . prison. Devout: The practicing Rastafarian built this temple to cannabis in Hollywood, where he spent years in self-imposed 'political refuge' 'Governor Christie made a political point to be opposed to the marijuana laws and cannabis laws and just taking a cue from the ""Just Say No"" campaign I figured I would put out the ads nationally to oppose Governor Christie’s campaign for presidency,' Forchion told My9NJ. In early November he requested that Governor Christie waive his jail term in light of his illness. He has been unable to receive proper care, he says, as treatment often needs to take place outside of the 10 allocated days. In addition, he says, it's impossible for him to afford flights to California when he's unable to work or raise money. 'I’m going back to Burlington County Jail,' Forchion told the Trentonian over the phone recently, from a Los Angeles bus stop. 'It’s boring. I just sit there in jail with a whole bunch of people who are wasting their lives. Boring. That’s the number one thing. And it doesn’t do one thing. What am I being corrected on? The state already legalized medical marijuana. I’m a medical marijuana patient. This is punishment for being outspoken and right.'","Ed Forchion, 49, was arrested for marijuana possession in 2010 then jailed for violating probation last year .

A five-year-old boy from Long Island became the youngest-ever hiker to complete the Appalachian Trail on Friday when he and his family reached Harper's Ferry, West Virginia after a months-long trek. Christian Thomas, also known as Buddy Backpacker, started the 2,180 mile trail, which stretches from Maine to Georgia, on April 27. Despite a hiccup caused by the government shutdown, Buddy managed to finish his continent traversing feat in less than a year. Big accomplishment: Buddy Backpacker, AKA Christian Thomas, shows off his Junior Park Ranger badge after becoming the youngest hiker to ever complete the Appalachian Trail on Friday . Buddy had travel companions in his parents Dion Pagonis and Andrea Rego, who gave up life behind a desk to give the five-year-old a taste of adventure. Through frigid temperatures, a government shutdown and even a hurricane, the family beat all odds and completed the trail where the started it--in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. 'Itâ€™s official,' read the heart-warming post on the official Buddy Packpacker website. They have finished every mile and they are now thru hikers!' 'Congratulations, Buddy Backpacker,' the post continues. 'You are amazing and we are so proud of you!' Thru . hiker is a term used to differentiate between day hikers--who do chunks . of the trail or hike it piecemeal--and those who attempt to go the . distance and hike the entire trail in one fell swoop. 'ItÂ¿s official,' read the heart-warming post on the official Buddy Packpacker website. 'They have finished every mile and they are now thru hikers!' On track: Five-year-old Buddy Backpacker could become the youngest hiker to successfully make the over 2,000 mile journey . Lessons: The rambunctious little boy got lessons in math, science and other subjects from his parents as they hiked the trail . Homeward bound: The family had about 600 miles to go back in November and have now reached the coveted goal . Journey: Buddy hiked the 2,180-mile trail with his parents Dion and Andrea . Impressive: Christian's trail name was Buddy Backpacker. He and his family made many friends along the way as they trekked from Maine to Georgia beginning last April . At 2,180 miles long, hiking the Appalachian Trial is a major accomplishment that anyone, let alone a 5-year-old boy, would be proud of . Nom de trail: Many hikers following the route use trail names, which is how five-year-old Christian came to be known as Buddy Backpacker . The family camped along the route or stayed in hostels, and Buddy Backpacker - Christian's trail name -  learned to count, spell and do math along the way. 'I don't think we knew that he was setting the record officially until after we started,' Rego told WCYB 5. At 2,180 miles long, the Appalachian Trial is one of the longest continuous footpaths in the world. It covers 14 states between Maine and Georgia, with the largest section, of about 400 miles, in Virginia. About 2,000 'thru-hikers' - those completing it in one journey - start the trail each year but only one in four make it to the end. The total elevation of the mountainous trail is the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest 16 times. On average, a hiker burns up 6,000 calories a day on the trail. Most thru hikers start in Georgia in the spring, making the best of the weather before reaching Maine in fall. The first person to ever complete the route was Myron Avery, when he plotted its path in 1936. Many hikers following the route use trail names, which is how five-year-old Christian came to be known as Buddy Backpacker. When they started their journey at . the Appalachian Conservancy Center in West Virginia, they were told that . the youngest person to ever complete the trail was a six-year-old who . hiked it in 1980. The couple hadn't set out to break any records. On their website, where they post updates about Buddy's . progress, the hikers describe themselves as: 'A couple in . our late twenties trying to figure out how it is you raise another . human being'. The group traveled light, with the main luxury item being an iPad Mini that they used to plot their route and find shelters along the way. They also had a Jeep to get them to the trail heads each day, a tent that sheltered them through all kinds of weather, and a Marmot rain jacket to protect Buddy on windy trails. Instead of going to school Buddy had the outside world as his classroom and listens to educational CDs. 'He hikes with educational music, he's . learning French, he's learning to count, spell, add and subtract while . he hikes without the distraction of other kids or being in the . classroom,' Rego said. The couple added that unlike other 'thru-hikers' Buddy's age gave him the advantage of unlimited energy. Competition: The family was told that back in 1980, a 6-year-old completed the trail. Now Christian has won the title . Rare: About 2,000 'thru-hikers' - those completing it in one journey - start the trail each year but only one in four make it to the end . High life: While other children are at school, Buddy had his lessons at the top of mountains . Pit stop: Buddy stops for lunch. On average hikers consume up to 6,000 calories a day on the Appalachian Trail . 'He never hurts the next morning like most . thru-hikers do. His regeneration is overnight. He's had it easier than . most hikers,' Pagonis, a graphic designer, said. The couple's positive experience hiking with their young son inspired them to create the Hikes for Tykes fundraising page, to provide equipment and funding for other families wanting to follow in their footsteps. Since starting in spring the family, who had to weather Hurricane Irene in their tent, made excellent progress. The government shutdown forced them to detour briefly, but they were not deterred from their goal. Buddy said: 'We started in Harpers Ferry. We went . to Maine, then to Baxter State Park to Katahdin, and then to Rockfish . Gap, but the Shenandoah was closed.' The . family plans to turn the adventures of their youngster, who has scaled . mountains, camped in snow and met wild horses, into a children's books.

Britain’s second biggest supermarket put up prices on more than 100 products before cutting them to 50p in a New Year price war. Asda launched the promotion to grab customers from mainstream rivals and boasted its prices would be even cheaper than pound shops and Aldi. However, independent research has discovered that the prices of many of these products went up sharply in the ten weeks before the promotion was launched. The net effect of the yo-yo prices was to make savings look much bigger than they were. Yo yo prices: Asda has been accused of putting up prices on more than 100 products before cutting them to 50p in a New Year price war . The same tactic has been deployed by other major supermarkets in the past as a marketing strategy designed to attract customers trapped in a cost of living squeeze. The mainstream chains – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – are under huge pressure because thousands of shoppers are deserting to cheaper budget chains, such as Aldi and Lidl. The revelations about the Asda price cuts will come as no surprise to families who have lost trust in supermarkets to deliver the price cuts they claim. At the same time, official industry figures show that food prices continue to rise faster than rises in wages, which makes clear that any temporary reductions on some items are more than wiped out by increases on others. The research was carried out by retail experts at BrandView.com and published in the industry magazine The Grocer. The figures show that Asda reduced the price of 246 lines to 50p on January 1 on the back of a promised to ‘offer more value than ever’. Claims: Researchers say Oreo biscuits went up in October from 50p to £1.08 before going back down to 50p in January . In fact the price of 120 of these products was raised in the previous 10 weeks. At the same time, the average price of 155 items that were directly comparable with others sold by Tesco and Sainsbury’s rose by an average of 46per cent – 63p to 92p – over the same period. Denial: Asda said they would never deliberately mislead their customers but experts said today it was a common tactic . The investigation also found that 57 of the items that were reduced to 50p have now returned to their full price. On October 30, the Batchelors Deli Box went up from 50p to £1.19, while Pot Noodle increased from 50p to £1. Both then were reduced to 50p on January 1. Another big riser in October was Oreo vanilla biscuits, which climbed from 50p to £1.08 before going back down to 50p. Bryan Roberts, insight director at retail analysts Kantar, suggested supermarkets who are not open and straightforward with customers risk losing out. ‘This type of strategy -- of raising prices to make a promotion look more lucrative -- is commonplace among all the supermarkets,’ he said. ‘But it is not necessarily the right thing to do and Asda is not being as transparent as it could with its shoppers.’ When Asda launched the price cut promotion in January, its  chief merchandising officer for food, Barry Williams, said: ‘With hundreds of products at 50p, we’ re even making the pound shop and Aldi look expensive. ‘It goes without saying that Christmas can be a struggle financially … and it’s more clear than ever that UK shoppers’ priorities are well and truly focused on price. ‘That’s why, this January, we are offering more value than ever before across our stores on the products that people actually week in, week out. With hundreds of products at 50p, we’re even making the poundshop and Aldi look expensive.’ Asda, which is owned by Walmart of the US, claims it is holding down prices by £50million in the first three months of 2014 as part of a bigger £200m reduction during the year. The store denied trying to pull the wool over customers’ eyes. A spokesman said: ‘We would never deliberately mislead our customers, all we aim to do is save them money every day. ‘At Asda, we take pricing incredibly seriously, so much so that last year we formed a Pricing Integrity group that monitors every aspect of our pricing. Last year we invested over £130million directly into lowering prices and holding down the cost of living for our customers. ‘We’re equally proud that we have already committed to directly investing over £50million into lowering the costs of our products across our stores this quarter and we’ve now got more 50p lines than any other supermarket.’ In November, the retailer announced that it will be investing £1 billion in lowering prices and £250 million in quality, style and design over the next five years.","Experts say supermarket did it to look cheaper than Aldi and pound shops .

Three nurses have been arrested amid claims of serious neglect at the hospital where a patient died after being left in an ambulance for four hours last week. They are accused of falsifying records to cover up poor care at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, south Wales. The hospital is already at the centre of an investigation following the death of former miner Michael Bowen, 58 – who was forced to remain in a queuing ambulance. The nurses are accused of falsifying records to cover up poor care at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, south Wales (pictured) And there are fears that problems are continuing at the hospital- where only last Thursday queues of up to 14 ambulances were seen outside its Accident and Emergency department. The arrests came as campaigners demanded urgent action over mounting claims of ‘cruelty’ and ‘unnecessary suffering’ at the hospital. An independent review has now been ordered by the Welsh Government into the claims. Last night a whistleblower said she had been ignored when she raised concerns about poor care – and that reports she filed about dangerous incidents went missing. Former nurse Glenda Rodriguez-Noza said she saw a room being poorly cleaned, a dementia patient being roughly handled and a patient given the wrong medication. ‘I would fill out an incident form and later be told they had no record of it,’ she said. ‘I have kept copies of them so I have them.  An internal investigation found there was not enough evidence to support my claims and in the end it all became too stressful. ‘I want to speak out because I want these people to be held to account and to stop these mistakes happening again and again.’ Former nurse Glenda Rodriguez-Noza . Mrs Rodrigeuz-Noza, who worked at the Princess of Wales Hospital for eight years and left in 2009, is now involved in tribunal proceedings against the ABMU health board. Patients have also made allegations about care at the hospital. One pensioner was left in the resuscitation room for almost three hours, while an elderly amputee died after she was left nil by mouth for two days. Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said: ‘We apologise sincerely to the patients and families who we have let down at the Princess of Wales Hospital. ‘In May 2013 we invited an external team, Advancing Quality Alliance (AQuA), to review quality and safety at the Princess of Wales Hospital. ‘This was in response to serious complaints about care provided to some patients; critical Ombudsman’s reports; mortality rates, and a police investigation into allegations of falsification of records by some of our nurses. AQuA’s recommendations will be presented to our Board shortly, backed by an action plan.’","Nurses accused of falsifying patient records to cover up poor care .

Backlash: Account holders are outraged to discover they have been paying up to £300 a year for perks . Banks are suffering a customer backlash over claims they widely mis-sold fee-paying packaged accounts, official figures reveal today. There have been thousands of complaints from account holders who say they have paid up to £300 a year for perks which they never knew existed…and did not want. In the worst cases, consumers claim they were unwittingly signed up to these ‘rip-off’ deals and the fees automatically docked from their account. Many were sold the accounts by pushy staff at the high street banks who were paid commissions for meeting sales targets. Figures show how the Financial Ombudsman Service has seen complaints about packaged accounts soar by 155 per cent in the past nine months. It is now receiving dozens every day. And it is finding in favour of customers in eight out of ten cases. The Ombudsman says most of the complaints are about the way the account was sold. Many did not even realise they were paying for a packaged account as they had been ‘upgraded’ without being told. Some had been misled into believing a fee-charging account was their only option or were told they had to take it out to get the loan or mortgage they wanted. Others were lured into forking out for insurance policies only to later discover they were ineligible to claim on the cover they were paying for. The banks are now being forced to pay out thousands of pounds in compensation in the latest scandal to engulf them. They have already shelled out £13.3billion in compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance. An estimated one in five adults has an expensive packaged account, such as Lloyds Bank’s Premier, which costs £25 a month, the Barclays Additions Active account at £15 a month, and Halifax’s Ultimate Reward account at £12.50 a month. Complaints: Customers claim 'pushy' staff who get commission for sales encourage them to buy certain deals . Typical perks include travel insurance, breakdown cover, mobile phone insurance and even home contents insurance. Customers may also be offered low-cost loans and bigger overdrafts. But a report by the financial regulator estimated a third of these account holders fail to use the benefits for which they are paying up to £300 a year. It also found many were unable to claim when they needed to. Pensioners would not be covered by the travel insurance policy because they were too old or had a medical condition, or households without a car were paying for a useless breakdown policy. Rules brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority last March mean all banks must ensure the bolt-on insurance policies are suitable for the customer – and are clear and simple to understand. On top of this banks must send out a letter to all customers every year reminding them they have the account, and to check they are still eligible to claim. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd, said: . Lloyds Bank's Premier, £25 a month, Barclays Additions Active account, £15 a month, and Halifax's Ultimate Reward account, £12.50 a month, are among the deals that were raised with the Financial Ombudsman Service . ‘It’s extremely worrying to see an increase in complaints about packaged accounts when new rules were introduced last year to protect consumers from being sold products that they don’t need or can’t use. ‘The Financial Conduct Authority must rigorously enforce the rules to prevent mis-selling and take action against any bank that links staff bonuses to the sale of these products.’ A year ago the Ombudsman received barely 40 complaints a week about packaged accounts. But in the past nine months it has dealt with 3,107 – 155 per cent more than the rate in the previous financial year. And these are only those that have been rejected by the banks. This could mean the true number of complaints and compensation payouts is much higher. A spokesman for the Ombudsman says: ‘The good news is banks are reacting differently to how they did with PPI, when they fought us every step of the way.’","Account holders paid up to £300 a year for perks they did not know about .

Hillary Clinton has revealed that she has not driven a car in 18 years because Secret Service protocols prevent her from getting behind the wheel. The former Secretary of State and likely Democratic presidential candidate spoke today at a conference for the National Automobile Dealers Association in New Orleans. She said that the last time she drove herself in a car was in 1996 and apparently that didn't end well. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Back seat driver: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revealed that she hasn't driven a car herself in 18 years . 'The last time I actually drove a car myself was 1996 and I remember it very well and unfortunately so does the Secret Service which is why I haven't driven since then,' she said. 'I've always enjoyed stories about cars and adventures and I have to confess that one of the regrets I have about my public life is that I can't drive anymore. 'My husband thinks that's a blessing but he's the one who should talk.' Mrs Clinton was first granted Secret Service protection in 1991, during her husband's first campaign for President. That was carried through both of his White House terms and has now been extended for life after the limit for former presidents was pushed from 10 years after leaving office to their lifetimes. Previous earlier reports, dating back to when Mrs Clinton was running for president herself in 2008, cite unidentified aides who said that she sometimes drove her hybrid S.U.V. when she was at their home in Chappaqua, New York. Comes with the territory: The Clintons, seen together on January 1, were granted Secret Service protection ahead of his first election in 1991 and will have it for their lifetimes . Not anymore: Bill Clinton was able to drive his wife and daughter (and an unidentified friend) to his 46th birthday party in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1992 before he won the presidential election . Though it comes as little surprise that she expressed regret over her driving ban while speaking to a group of car manufacturers and sellers, her husband's inability to drive is something that has bothered him for some time. During an interview on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show in August 2012, the former President said that driving was the one thing he missed about his life before the White House. 'Whenever I'm on the golf course I always make them let me drive the golf cart,' he said. Mr Clinton said that there was no foreseeable change coming up soon- and that has nothing to do with his wife's expected run for office. 'If I want to give up Secret Service protection for life, I could do it,' he said of driving. Smile and wave: Mrs Clinton takes her position in the back seat of a car while on the 2008 presidential campaign . Driver included: Mrs Clinton, see here in January 2000, is regularly chauffeured by the Secret Service . During her speech today, Mrs Clinton also told a story about how one of her old cars was stolen and the theives later used it in a high-speed chase. 'I couldn't understand how they could get it to perform when I never could,' she said, according to The Wall Street Journal. 'I was a little proud of it.' Mrs Clinton, who commands speaking fees of upwards of $200,000, touched on far more serious subject as well, saying that assasination of Osama bin Laden was a highlight of her time as Secretary of State while the terrorist attack on the American consulate in Benghazi was the low point. She said that the death of the three Americans and Ambassador Chris Stevens was 'obviously a great personal loss because I am the one who sent him there'.","Mrs Clinton spoke to the National Automobile Dealers Association today and revealed that she hasn't spent much time in the driver's seat .

The boss of Npower who this week said high energy bills in Britain were due to 'draughty housing' has been accused of wasting energy at his home. Heat images from two properties belonging to Paul Massara, the energy firm's chief executive, show evidence of poor insulation, experts say. Mr Massara owns two homes - one a 16th century country property in Upper Wolvercote, Oxfordshire and another terrace home in Clapham, south London. Paul Massara's home in Oxfordshire. The thermal image shows heat escaping from the 16th century country property, say energy experts . Thermal images taken of both properties show they are 'far less energy-efficient than the average family home,' Andy Smale from independent consultancy Expert Energy told the Sun on Sunday. He added the images also indicate the houses could suffer from 'nasty drafts'. This week, Mr Massara caused outrage by blaming Britons for sky-high energy prices. He said households would save money if people turned off televisions and other electronic devices - and said his teenage daughters were guilty of wasting energy. Last week the energy boss advised Britons to turn off lights and electrical appliances in order to save on energy bills . He also blamed the government for higher charges - saying eco-schemes were to blame for increasing costs. He said green taxes would push bills up to £1,500 annually by 2020 - a figure the industry regulation Ofgem disputed. Npower raised its prices by 10.4 per cent late last year - a move predicted to affect around 3.1million customers. The company have since insisted it will reduce costs as a result of government taxes. Speaking with BBC Radio 4's Today show, Mr Massara said: 'The reality is that we have some of the cheapest prices in Europe but our bills are some of the highest because our houses are old and not insulated. 'It’s interesting. I have two teenage daughters. 'They have been brought up in a generation that has looked at energy efficiency, that has looked at climate change. 'They would never dream of walking out of a bathroom leaving the taps running. 'And yet my teenage daughters will walk out of a room and leave the lights on and their iPod playing and the TV on quite happily. 'So I do think we need to change our approach and the way we think about energy waste.' ‘The actual unit price of energy in the UK is one of the lowest in Europe – but bills are high because British houses waste so much energy. ‘If we can increase the efficiency of the UK’s old and draughty housing, we can ensure that annual energy bills are some of the lowest too.’","Two homes owned by boss Paul Massara are 'poorly insulated' say experts .

A Muslim woman who was allowed to wear a full-face veil in court will not have to remove it after she chose not to give evidence yesterday. Rebekah Dawson, 22, has so far been allowed to appear at her trial for alleged witness intimidation in a niqab showing just her eyes. Judge Peter Murphy ruled last September that she could wear the Islamic garment in court, but insisted that she would have to let the jury see her face if she chose to give evidence. Her barrister, Susan Meek, confirmed yesterday at Blackfriars Crown Court that Miss Dawson would not be giving evidence in her own defence – despite being aware that the jury would ‘draw such inferences as might be proper’ from her decision. Rebekah Dawson arrives at Blackfriars Crown Court wearing a niqab. She and her brother Matthias are accused of intimidating a potential witness . Dawson, of Hackney, east London, is on trial alongside her brother, Matthias Dawson, 32, accused of intimidating a security guard at the Finsbury Park mosque in north London last June. It is alleged they approached Daudi Yusuf at the mosque after an incident between him and Ms Dawson’s husband. Both defendants deny a single charge of witness intimidation. Ms Meek, for Rebekah Dawson, told the jury her client's veil had been the 'elephant in the room' during the trial but they should ignore it while deciding on their verdicts. Summing up Dawson's defence case, Ms Meek said: 'She was given a choice by the judge - she either gave evidence with the niqab off or she remained in the dock with it on. She has remained in the dock. Dawson is on trial alongside her brother accused of intimidating a security guard at the Finsbury Park mosque . Rebekah Dawson arriving at Blackfriars Crown Court in Central London for her trial last week . 'You have to try the case on the evidence you have heard in the courtroom without having heard from her.' She added: 'This is not a trial about the niqab, the niqab is not on trial in this courtroom. This is a woman accused of a criminal offence who happens to wear a niqab.' Ms Meek said Rebekah Dawson admitted speaking to Mr Yusuf at the mosque on the evening of June 23. Covered up: Rebekah Dawson has not removed her niqab for any of her court hearings . Judge Peter Murphy told the jury that Rebekah Dawson was 'fully entitled' to dress how she chose to in court . The debate as to whether a burka can be worn in court centers around a conflict between The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and a necessity for jurors to see the face of someone giving evidence. Article 9 of ECHR gives the defendant a right to manifest her religion or belief. But in September the judge ruled she must remove the garment if she stood in the witness box. During case management, the judge gave the following guidance: . -The defendant must comply with all directions given by the Court to enable her to be properly identified at any stage of the proceedings. -The defendant is free to wear the niqaab during trial, except while giving evidence. -The defendant may not give evidence wearing the niqaab. -The defendant may give evidence from behind a screen shielding her from public view, but not from the view of the judge, the jury, and counsel; or by mean of a live TV link. -[T]hat no drawing, sketch or other image of any kind of the defendant while her face is uncovered be made in court, or disseminated, or published outside court” Dawson claims they discussed the original row involving her husband, on June 10. She alleges the original row started when Yusuf asked her to remove her veil at the mosque. Ms . Meek said the conversation between Dawson and Yusuf at the mosque on . June 23 may have been irritating to Mr Yusuf, but it was not . intimidating. People in a nearby room were shown on CCTV not being disturbed by any raised voices, the court heard. 'It was not a shouting match, there are no raised voices in any shape or fashion,' she said. 'No one is getting concerned about what is being said.' The trial will continue tomorrow, when the jury is expected to retire to consider its verdicts. Earlier in the trial, Judge Murphy told the jury that Dawson was 'fully entitled' to dress how she chose to in court. He told jurors to put aside any feelings . they might have about her appearance because they would have nothing to . do with the case. Muslim convert Mr Dawson admitted attending the mosque with the hood of his hoodie raised. But he said he had been there because he had been giving his sister a lift through the area, she had wanted to pray, and he decided to do the same. He said he heard his sister talking with a man but denied being involved himself.","Judge Peter Murphy made the landmark ruling that 22-year-old Rebekah Dawson must remove her niqab when giving evidence .

Trial: Bill Roache, pictured today outside Preston Crown Court, has been cleared of one of the five counts of indecent assault he faced . Coronation Street star Bill Roache was today cleared of one of the counts of indecent assault he was facing in his sex abuse trial. The judge at Preston Crown Court told jurors they should find the actor not guilty on one of the seven charges after the prosecution declined to offer further evidence. The allegation was one of two made by a woman who said she was aged 14 when Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in the ITV soap, twice made her perform a sex act on him. Giving evidence, the complainant said the actor first struck in the gents' toilets at Granada Studios in Manchester in the summer of 1965. Jurors were then shown a letter and signed photograph that Roache, 81, had sent to her after that alleged incident in which he asked to her write back to him when she returned to school. The woman claimed later that same year she was picked up by the actor from the studios in his Rolls-Royce and they had a conversation of a sexual nature. She said she thought that she had also been indecently assaulted in his car but she had 'no actual memory' of the episode. Mr Justice Holroyde said: 'In relation to that episode the witness was not giving evidence that it did happen, she was giving evidence that she was thinking it did happen and that is not a sufficient evidential basis for the conviction of an offence.' Family: Roache arriving at court with his children to hear that he would be cleared of one charge . Roache, 81, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, . remains on trial over two counts of rape and four counts of indecent . assault involving the five complainants, who were aged 16 and under at . time of the alleged incidents between 1965 and 1971. Three women claim Roache abused them at Granada Studios, while the fourth claims she was abused as he drove his luxury car. Another woman told the court that the actor raped her in his home after inviting her inside on two separate occasions when she was 15. He denies all the charges. After closing the prosecution case today, Anne Whyte QC told the jury: 'We do not invite you to convict on any allegation where the witness has no recollection. So we do not proceed against Mr Roache in relation to count 2.' 'Count 2' refers to the allegation that Roache assaulted a 14-year-old girl between June and September 1965. Letter: Roache sent this signed photo and letter to an alleged victim; he was accused of assaulting her twice, but has now been cleared of one of the charges . Mr Justice Holroyde told the jurors: 'Each charge is a separate allegation which requires your separate consideration and separate verdict. 'The prosecution acknowledge quite rightly that in law the evidence which [the witness] gave cannot be sufficient for a jury to find a guilty verdict. 'The prosecution are no longer pursuing that charge. Mr Roache is entitled to a not guilty verdict on that charge.' He said it was 'a matter of law' that the jury 'could not and must not' convict on the count concerned. The trial continues tomorrow morning, when Roache is expected to give evidence from the witness box.","Coronation Street star was accused of twice assaulting 14-year-old fan .

The Conservative Party is facing ‘its . own Falkirk crisis’ – after a dirty tricks campaign designed to oust an . MP from her seat before the election was exposed in a secret report. Thirsk . and Malton MP Anne McIntosh, who counts David Cameron among her . supporters, has been fighting a long-running battle with senior Tories . in her constituency who would like to see her deselected. One . of the only female Tory MPs in the North of England, the MP’s backers . have claimed that her detractors resent being represented by a woman. And a leaked report has now revealed . that local officials broke the party’s rules before staging a ‘flawed’ deselection vote – with the dispute compared to the Falkirk vote-rigging . row which tore the Labour Party apart last year. Miss . McIntosh, who has a majority of 11,000, first survived a deselection . vote in 2009 when party members opted to keep her as their MP. However, . in January 2013 she had to face another attempted coup, after the local . Conservative Association’s executive committee took on a significant . number of new members shortly before holding a vote to decide the MP’s . future. The ‘wrongly’ expanded committee decided not to reselect Miss McIntosh, but the move sparked uproar in the rural community. A . petition supporting the MP was quickly handed in to officials at the . party’s headquarters, who decided to order an inquiry into the row. The . inquiry’s findings were initially suppressed but the resulting report . has now been published online by one of the MP’s disgruntled supporters.

The report rejected claims . that she had failed to communicate with local party officials saying . there was ‘no evidence she neglected her duties’. It . also hinted that, by breaking the rules on new committee members – . which are designed to prevent ‘an unrepresentative takeover’ – local . party officials had attempted to fix the deselection vote. It . singled out constituency chairman Peter Steveney – an opponent of the . MP – saying he behaved ‘unfairly’ towards Miss McIntosh. As . a result of the inquiry, party chiefs ordered the deselection  decision . to be declared null and void and the executive committee to be reformed . in accordance with the party’s rules. ‘It is a sad fact that those principles . and traditional values for which I stand are not so prized today by some . as they once were by all true blue Conservatives.'

But they might be shocked if they knew what was going through his mind. The veteran Channel 4 host has confessed he thinks of sex every time he meets a woman. And he says he likes to consider ‘what could be’ with his female friends and co-workers. Insisting it is a ‘natural animal element of sustaining life’ for men to think of all women as potential sexual partners, he said being a man was ‘all about women’. 'An interesting barrier': Jon Snow said the urge to consider women potential partners is 'parked' once you work together or become friends . Now married to a woman 27 years his junior, the 66-year-old also opened up about his own romantic past, revealing he once had an affair with a librarian nearly twice his age while at sixth-form college. ‘Sex comes into every evaluation of a woman, there’s no doubt about it. It’s there,’ he said in a newspaper interview. ‘Once you’ve established a friendship or a working relationship with a woman, it’s parked. But it’s an interesting barrier. When you’ve gone through it and arrived at the other side, it’s never a problem again. ‘Well I’m not saying it is a problem at all, it’s rather a delicious thing really, “what might have been” or “what could be”.’ Snow said he believed sex played a ‘different role in different men’s personas’, adding: ‘We are defined by women: They give birth to us and then they define us, although lots try to ignore it.’ 'Defined': Snow said that women are an inescapable influence on men's personalities. He is pictured left with his wife, Precious Lunga, and right at a Paralympic ceremony in 2012 . No doubt many men will agree with his frank analysis of the male psyche. But what the women in Snow’s life will make of his comments can only be guessed at. As a TV news presenter he has worked alongside several well-known women, including former ITN anchor Julia Somerville, 66, and former Channel 4 reporter Samira Ahmed, 45, who quit in 2011 claiming that bosses had treated her in a sexist manner. Among his current roster of co-hosts is presenter Cathy Newman, 39, and the programme’s social affairs editor Jackie Long. Snow has had an eventful romantic life. He was once briefly engaged to fellow ITN journalist Anna Ford, 70, and has two children with former partner Madeleine Colvin, 64. Familiar face: Jon Snow on Channel 4 news . And proving that age is no barrier to love, he married 39-year-old  Zimbabwean-born academic Precious Lunga in March 2010. Snow said her ‘mental age’ was far higher than his, saying: ‘She’s somewhere in her forties. She’s very, very mature. I mean, she’s a serious boffin.’ Revealing he once had an affair with a much older librarian while a sixth-former at Scarborough Tech, he said: ‘I was warned off by my lecturer, who told me I was very unwise to be seen going off in the lunch hour in the librarian’s car.’ The presenter made his comments to the London Evening Standard as he prepared to chair a debate on fatherhood. He insisted he was a strong supporter of women’s equality in the workplace, but admitted he had not done as much as he could have to promote his female colleagues. He said: ‘While I aspire to be a feminist, I think I am guilty of just as many failings in terms of supporting women’s equality. I couldn’t say I’d really fought for women to enjoy many of the fantastic benefits I’ve enjoyed.’","Snow said thinking of all women as potential partners is 'natural'

EastEnders is ‘frozen in aspic’ and does not reflect the changing face of East London, the show’s new boss has claimed. The soap, set in Hackney, must take into account the influence of trendy Shoreditch just down the road, said executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who took over in August last year. He said: ‘It should feel more like London. It’s been frozen in aspic for too long.' 'Frozen': EastEnders, set in Hackney, east London, has not changed with the times sufficiently, said its executive producer . Trendy: Now hip Shoreditch in east London will start 'creeping in' to the soap. Pictured is Boxpark, a 'pop-up' mall made of shipping containers which is next to Shoreditch High Street station . Hub: Shoreditch has become a big attraction for young artists and technology firms . The BBC1 soap is undergoing a revamp, including the recruitment of hardman actor Danny Dyer as Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter, as part of an attempt to reinvigorate the drama following a ratings slump. The BBC recently unveiled plans to build a new Albert Square, which will replicate the original but also be 20 per cent bigger to allow the long-running soap to open up new locations to film in. East London has taken off since EastEnders was first broadcast in 1985. Terraced houses on Fassett Square, the area of Hackney which was used as the original inspiration for Albert Square, now fetch as much as £700,000. Speaking to the Radio Times, Mr Treadwell-Collins said the soap had to keep up with the world around it. Headed to the Square? Shoreditch is often the canvas for vibrant street art . He said: 'Sharon (Letitia Dean) said recently that she's looking to be a landlady and as a result you'll see the edges of Shoreditch creeping into EastEnders. It's got to reflect the modern world.' Shoreditch, a once run-down part of London, is now popular with 'hipsters', art students and technology companies, while even former Prime Minister Tony Blair recently dined out there. Mr Treadwell-Collins, who took over as executive producer in August last year following the departure of Lorraine Newman, also said he wanted to see the soap focus less on action and more on character. In the past 12 months, Coronation Street, which recently beat EastEnders to best soap at the National Television Awards, has featured an inferno at the Rovers Return while Emmerdale had a siege at the Woolpack. But Treadwell-Collins told the magazine: 'EastEnders has got to shake up the audience. We don't want to do cover versions of greatest hits. 'EastEnders has to sing new songs, otherwise it doesn't feel fresh. And it also has to be about people and feelings and emotions. I've never been a fan of blowing things up.' Mr Treadwell-Collins said he was happy to see the return of familiar faces, including Lacey Turner as Stacey Branning, as well as new characters. Revamp: The classic look of EastEnders, left, which first broadcast in 1985, will mingle with the trendier environs of Shoreditch, now a hub for new bars and restaurants, right . 'It's good to have one foot in the past while looking to the future. My idea is to make the show feel fresh with the Carters, but also a bit nostalgic by bringing back characters we love. And there should be more secrets that will make the viewer gasp. 'You want those moments where the audience is thinking, ""Oh my God, I didn't know that was going to happen."" That used to be what the show did brilliantly and what I really want it to do again.' He said that he had been a 'proper die-hard EastEnders fan', even before he began working on the soap. He told the magazine: 'I remember poring over the map of Albert Square that Radio Times published when the first episode aired. I grew up in Radlett in Hertfordshire, which is about 10 minutes down the road from where EastEnders is filmed in Elstree, and I'd go along to the studio and stick my head through the gates. 'I'd never felt an affinity with Corrie - it's a fantastic show, but it wasn't my thing. I liked EastEnders because it felt dangerous, real and naughty, and also that it was saying something about life,' he said. Shake-up: Recent changes to EastEnders include Danny Dyer, left, joining the show - and scenes where his character Mick Carter accepted the homosexuality of his son, Lee Carter (centre) 'Stalking is a heavy word, but I did once stalk Pam St Clement (who played Pat Butcher) around the Radlett branch of WH Smith,' he said. 'She and I have laughed about it since'. New recruit Dyer has played against type in the soap, with his character embracing his son Johnny (Sam Strike) and telling him he is proud of him for coming out as gay. Changes: Dominic Treadwell-Collins explains the changes to the series in a Radio Times interview . The actor said that it was about time EastEnders featured a good father. 'I don't think EastEnders usually portrays good fathers,' Dyer said. 'They're often quite dysfunctional. I'm one of the first to come in and be a really good parent. I think that's what was needed. Plus they used the perception of what I'm known for and spun it on its head. 'It was a gamble. But I've had letters from young gay men who'd been too scared to come out, but who did so after watching that episode.' Meanwhile, Coronation Street's producer Stuart Blackburn said that he was not resting on his laurels, despite getting plaudits for the way the ITV soap portrayed Hayley Cropper's death. 'I abhor complacency,' he said. 'Hayley's death was pitch perfect. It's the proudest I've ever been. But after it's aired, who gives a toss? 'We have the next 12 months to deal with and it's got to be magnificent. 'If we have a bad six weeks, then it can be six months before we get the audience back. But I've every confidence in my stories.'","Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said the soap was 'frozen'

Shocked: Former soldier Ray Coulson and his wife Shainie - who has  been ordered to leave Britain because he is no longer in the military . He served in the British Army for 22 years with an ‘exemplary record’, risking his life in both Gulf Wars. But despite his sacrifice, Ray Coulson’s young family risks being torn apart by an extraordinary decision from the UK Border Agency. The 42-year-old’s Canadian wife Shainie and their three children have been ordered to leave Britain – because he is no longer in the military. Officials rejected Mrs Coulson’s application to remain in the UK claiming the teaching assistant had not ‘lost ties’ with her homeland. Instead, the UKBA suggested Mr Coulson should endure a ‘degree of hardship’ by ripping up his roots and relocating nearly 4,000 miles to Canada. His supporters have urged ministers to intervene, pointing out the decision is at odds with the Government’s pledge to uphold the Military Covenant –  Britain’s duty of care to its servicemen. Campaigners contrast his case with that of foreigners who have been allowed to stay in Britain despite dreadful crimes, such as Iraqi Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car. Mr Coulson said: ‘I feel like I’ve been betrayed. It’s unbelievable that you can serve Queen and country for so many years, risk your life by getting shot at on the front line, make endless sacrifices for the nation and then be told you can’t have your family live here with you.’ Mr Coulson, a bombardier, fought in both Gulf Wars. During the second conflict, he was part of the 3rd Royal Horse Artillery and regularly found himself under fire as he transported missiles to the front line. Family ties: Mr Coulson married his wife in 2006 while he was deployed at the British Army Training Unit in Alberta, Canada. They are pictured with their children Blake, Bailey and Kallum .

In November last year Mrs Coulson’s leave to remain was about to expire so she applied to renew it. But the family were stunned to learn last week that this had been rejected by the UKBA. Officials accepted the couple were in a ‘genuine and subsisting relationship’. But in a letter explaining the decision, Miss K Pickersgill, on behalf of Home Secretary Theresa May, said: ‘You and your children would return to Canada as a family unit and continue to enjoy your family life together. ‘Whilst this may involve a degree of disruption to your private life, this is considered to be proportionate.’ Miss Pickersgill told her that relocating to Canada ‘may cause a degree of hardship for your British partner’ but she concluded there were not ‘insurmountable obstacles’ to prevent this. Last night Mr Coulson said: ‘I find it extremely unfair that because I am no longer in the Army we are being discriminated against and my family has to be broken apart.’ The family plan to appeal the UKBA decision.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said today's charges related to the sexual abuse of five victims, three of whom were under 16 at the time. Fred Talbot, 64, from Bowdon, Altrincham, has today been charged with 10 sexual offences, Greater Manchester Police said . The television presenter from Bowdon, Altrincham, is due to appear at Manchester Magistratesâ€™ Court on 11 February. Six counts of indecent assault relate to incidents involving one victim who attended a school in Newcastle at the time. The other offences relate to four former pupils of Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, the police spokesman said. Talbot, who was a regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning, is alleged to have committed the offences between 1968 and 1983, involving up to five male victims aged 19 and under.

Celebrity contestants on Channel 4’s new skiing game show have been criticised for not wearing safety helmets by a brain injury charity. Hairdresser Nicky Clarke and socialite Henry Conway were seen practising on an artificial ski slope during the first episode of The Jump without ski helmets. It comes weeks after Formula 1 legend Michael Schumacher’s life was saved by wearing a helmet when he crashed while skiing in France. Dangerous: Henry Conway (centre) was not wearing a safety helmet while skiing on Channel 4's The Jump . Mr Conway, 31, who is the son of disgraced Tory MP Derek Conway, was seen wearing a black fur hat while on the training slope in the UK, whilst Mr Clarke, 55, let his famous tresses hang out. During the programme aired on Sunday night, Mr Clarke said that he liked to ‘feel the wind in my hair’. Mr Conway said: ‘I’m hoping to bring some style and sophistication to the slopes as everyone needs a bit of winter glamour.’ Luke Griggs, a spokesman for Headway, the brain injury association, said he believed the celebrity contestants should have set a better example. Socialite Henry Conway was filmed wearing a black fur hat while on the training slope . He said: ‘Ski helmets offer vital protection to all skiers - whether novices on dry slopes here in the UK, or vastly experienced skiers going off-piste. ‘We have to make people realise that it is not only high-speed accidents that can lead to skiers suffering fatal or lifelong injury. 'Even a seemingly minor injury, such as that tragically suffered by Natasha Richardson on a nursery slope in 2009, can have a major impact. ‘To those who suggest they prefer to feel the wind in their hair rather than wearing a helmet, we would simply suggest they speak to Headway service users who felt the same way until they sustained a brain injury in a fall. Hairdresser Nicky Clarke was captured on the artificial ski slope with his luscious locks out but no helmet . During the programme aired on Sunday night Mr Clarke said that he liked to feel the wind in his hair . Risk: Nicky Clarke on the slopes but the hairdresser chose not to wear a helmet . 'For these people, and their families, life will never be the same. ‘The thrill of skiing or snowboarding is in no way diminished by the wearing of a helmet and we hope all the participants in The Jump will set a better example throughout the rest of the series by wearing helmets.’ The Jump features 12 celebrities, including Sinitta, Sir Steve Redgrave and Anthea Turner, competing in winter sports such as the skeleton, two-man bob, giant slalom and ski-cross. Mr Clarke became the first contestant to be eliminated on Sunday night. Fashion before safety: Henry Conway wore a black fur hat when he took to the slopes . In 2008, Mr Conway’s father Derek was ordered to repay over £3,000 of public money that he had given to him while he was in his employment. He was also suspended and expelled from the Tory party for paying his other son for work that he did not appear to have done. In the same year, Henry reportedly threw a party called ‘F*** Off I’m Rich’. A spokesperson for Channel 4 said: ‘The health and safety of those taking part in The Jump is the highest priority and all contributors are provided with necessary safety equipment to use during training and events. Safety equipment is mandatory during events.’ Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher poses with his wife Corinna Schumacher at the winter resort of Madonna di Campiglio, in 2005 .

This is the moment a fox was dragged out of a hole and shot dead while children as young as five watched on. The images, released by anti-hunt campaigners, show a group of terriermen setting their dog on the  creature. The fox tries attempts to hide in a badger’s sett - but the three adults fire into the ground and use spades to dig it out. These images show the moment a group of men unearthed and shot a fox as three young children watched on . A farmer who captured the killing on camera says the group then called over three children to show them the remains. The men can then be seen walking away with two dead animals. It is unclear where and how the second fox was killed. The shocking incident happened shortly after a hunt on December 28 by the Modbury Harriers, which rides in south Devon. The League Against Cruel Sports has handed the photos over to the RSPCA and asked them to investigate it as a possible breach of the Hunting Act.. The law bans hunting foxes with a pack of hounds - however it doesn’t cover the use of dogs to flush out animals underground. The images, released by anti-hunt campaigners, show the men setting dogs on the animal before it hides in a badger's set. They then dig the fox out and shoot it . The farmer, who has asked not to be identified, said the fox was initially chased across the field by hounds. The huntsmen moved on but before it could climb out of the badger’s sett three men with guns and spades arrived - with three children following close behind. The farmer said: 'I sat there in disbelief - how could those guys think any of what had played out was fit for young children to witness? 'I watched in horror as a whole pack of hounds poured into our neighbour’s field then piled into our meadow. The men pictured taking two animals away. Anti-hunt campaigners have condemned the 'horrific' behaviour and handed the images in to the RSPCA . 'They made that hideous blood-curdling squealing - known as ‘speaking’ - which means they are on the scent of a fox. 'I saw a beautiful vixen flash across the meadow and disappear into an old badger sett on my neighbour’s farm. 'At the top of the hill I saw a couple of guys carrying spades and a terrier on a lead. They were going to dig her out and kill her right then and there. 'The men came down and filled in the exit holes to stop the fox escaping and then called the children over to watch as they dug out and killed the young vixen.' The farmer said the three men came across a second badger inside the hole which they also shot dead as the children craned their necks to see what was happening. The Countryside Alliance said there was 'no question' the behaviour was legal - describing the killing as 'professional and humane'. He added: 'This is the dirty underbelly of fox hunting, the bit they don’t like even their followers to see. 'But I was disgusted to see the terriermen had brought three youngsters to watch - one was only about five years old. The farmer, who keeps a flock of 140 breeding ewes and a few chickens, is strongly anti-hunting and has complained about huntsmen trespassing on his land. The Hunting Act came in to force in February 2005 and was passed under the 1997 Labour government. It bans hunting any wild mammal  - including foxes, deer and hares -with dogs in England and Wales. Under the Act it is completely legal to 'flush out' - i.e. coax an animal from a hole or a sett - with dogs. It is also legal to drag hunt with hounds. This is when the dogs are trained to follow and artificial scent and is now common practice across the country. Hunting mammals with dogs was banned in Scotland two years earlier under the Protection of Wild Mammals Act 2002. It is still legal to hunt in Northern Ireland. Breaking the law is a summary offence. Those found guilty of doing so would be fined.There were 181 convictions under the Hunting Act up to the end of 2010. Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports (LACS), said: 'This horrific incident of animal cruelty shows not only a total disregard for the dogs and foxes but also for the welfare of the children.' The Countryside Alliance, however, said there was 'no question' the behaviour was legal - describing the killing as 'professional and humane'. Spokesman Tim Bonner said the outrage merely demonstrated that outsiders do not 'understand the realities of the countryside and country life'. Mr Bonner said he had spoken to the hunt, who told him the killing had been carried out as 'pest control” with the permission of the landowner. He said: 'The children were not in the hole - they were close by - and as far as we are concerned it was a totally professional operation and nothing which should upset anyone. 'They were using the terrier work exemption and properly, professionally and humanely managing the killing of those two foxes. 'There would be plenty of children of that sort of age involved in pheasant shoots and ferreting. 'The vast majority of children eat meat and at the end of the day it is a dead animal.'","Images, released by anti-hunt campaigners, show men setting dog on fox .

Nearly 1,000 military widows have had their pensions snatched by the Ministry of Defence after finding new love, the Mail can reveal. Under controversial Government rules, bereaved wives who sacrificed their careers because of their husband's work in the Armed Forces are being stripped of as much as £10,000 a year if they enter new relationships. Furious campaigners say it is 'obscene' to force a widow to forego the retirement income if she remarries or cohabits with a new partner. 'Entitlement': Army wives, such as the women pictured here at the start of the Falklands war, risk losing their pensions should their husbands die and they remarry . Ministers have said the Coalition will not change the law to treat all widows equally. Their stance has led to claims the Government is breaking the Military Covenant, which David Cameron enshrined in law to set out the nation's duty of care to military personnel, veterans and their families. Chrissie Fraser, 64, from West London, said that she felt betrayed by the Ministry of Defence for seizing her £900 monthly military pension after she found a new partner. Mrs Fraser, who followed Lieutenant-Colonel Clive Fraser on postings around the globe before he died from a heart attack in 2006, said the loss of income had left her stressed and facing hardship. She said: 'We are not asking for handouts, just for our rightful entitlement. My faith in the army which my husband revered has gone. 'I gave my time, and my energy to an institution Clive believed in. 'He thought he had done the best thing for us. I do not feel sorry for myself, I just feel angry now. My years as an Army Wife amount to nothing.' New figures uncovered by Parliamentary questions reveal 987 widows have been deprived of their late husbands pension since 2001. Experts predict more than 1,000 face losing their income this year as bureaucrats launch a crackdown. On average widows forfeit around £3,000 a year. 'Faith is gone': One widow affected by the rule said she had lost faith in the Army, which her dead husband 'revered' The rule applies to the old Armed Forces pension scheme and states that if a widow finds new love they will forfeit their retirement pot. The rule does not apply to widows of troops killed on duty. The scheme was replaced in 2005 by a newer one which allows widows to keep their income if they remarry. Air Marshal Sir Christopher Coville, chairman of the Forces Pension Society, said: 'Many women have sacrificed their own careers to follow their husband's work with the Armed Forces, contributing to their husbands' pensions in loyalty and devotion to spouse and country. 'Forces widows have very little chance to earn money, let alone build a career because they are moved from base to base, often in remote, foreign locations, with very little notice. Many are expected to take on unpaid social and community support roles. 'They have truly earned a share in their husband's pension and to argue otherwise is deeply insulting.' Labour MP Katy Clark, who uncovered the figures, said: 'Taking away these pensions is wrong and unfair and it has caused a lot of anger. No change: Defence minister Anna Soubry said that the pensions rules will not be changed due to the financial implications . 'A serviceman who has built up a pension entitlement expects it to be passed to their spouse when they die. 'A widow who has made a considerable sacrifice should not be placed in the dreadful situation of having to decide whether to remarry or keep their pension.' Some widows decide to secretly cohabit without telling the authorities so that they can keep their income, even though they risk being prosecuted for fraud. Last year Carol Garside, 48, the widow of a Royal Navy diver was jailed after admitting pocketing her Armed Forces pension while living with, and then marrying, another man. Defence Minister Anna Soubry said: 'It has long been the policy of successive Governments that changes or improvement to public sector pension schemes should not be applied retrospectively. 'This is because legacy pension issues cannot be looked at in isolation; addressing one issue would increase the pressure to address legacy issues in all public sector pension schemes, and this would have huge financial implications.'","Bereaved wives are being stripped of as much as £10,000 a year .

Prison officer Sophia King-Chinnery has been jailed for ten months after having a secret lesbian romance with an inmate serving life for murder . A female prison officer who had a secret lesbian romance with an inmate serving life for murder has been jailed for ten months. Sophia King-Chinnery, 25, embarked on the relationship with inmate Sarah Anderson after she had been jailed for stabbing a cyclist to death. The pair exchanged hundreds of love letters in which Anderson referred to the prison officer as her 'wife', Southwark Crown Court has heard. But the inmate was left distraught after hearing rumours King-Chinnery was cheating on her with somebody else. Anderson, 31, was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years in March 2009 after being convicted of stabbing Dee Willis, 28, in the neck in Peckham, south east London. The 14-month relationship started in November 2011 while Anderson was being held at Holloway women's prison in north London. The court heard the relationship continued even after suspicious prison bosses warned King-Chinnery, of Surbiton, Surrey, to stay away from Anderson. The prison officer allowed Anderson to have a mobile phone for eight months, between January and September 2012 so they could spend hours chatting to each other. When confronted by her bosses in February 2013, King-Chinnery accepted she had an ‘emotional relationship’ with her jailbird lover after experiencing difficulties with her colleagues. She admitted they had mobile phone contact, adding that her ‘judgement had been clouded’. But prosecutor Andrew Howarth said: ‘Clearly the relationship went further than an emotional one.’ Prison officer Sophia King-Chinnery (pictured) has been jailed for ten months after having a secret lesbian romance with an inmate serving life for murder . ‘The letters made clear the nature of the relationship between the two women was sexual.’ Sentencing King-Chinnery, Judge Michael Gledhill QC told her: ‘You come from an exceptional family - how on earth does it come about that you are standing in the dock of this court? ‘I understand that in the time before you began your relationship with Sarah Anderson, you were at a low ebb. ‘But the fact of the matter is you were a prison officer and from the moment you became a prison officer, you were well aware of the rules, which don’t include having any sort of personal relationship with the prisoners that you are supposed to be looking after. ‘No doubt that has been emphasised time and time again. The 14-month relationship started in November 2011 while Anderson was being held at Holloway women's prison in north London (pictured) ‘You knew Sarah Anderson was in possession of a mobile phone and you did nothing about it at all, on the contrary you used that in order to make contact with her whenever you chose. ‘I don’t find any grounds to suspend your sentence. A message has to be sent out to prison officers who have done what you have done, form a relationship with a prisoner, that they will be sent to prison. ‘I’m aware you will have a much harder time than others when serving your sentence but you brought that on yourself.’ Sporting a half-shaved head with a mass of curls and wearing a black suit, King-Chinnery sobbed as she was led out of the dock. Her family and friends wept in the public gallery as the sentence was passed. Southwark Crown Court (pictured) heard the pair exchanged hundreds of love letters in which Anderson referred to the prison officer as her 'wife' The judge handed Anderson a concurrent three-month prison term. She spent 28 days in segregation after the mobile phone was discovered. The phone is still at large after Anderson refused to disclose its whereabouts. Judge Gledhill told her: ‘You knew perfectly well prisoners are not allowed to have mobile phones. ‘There is no evidence the phone was used to commit any form of crime but no doubt that phone was available to others to be used.’ Rachel Bright, defending King-Chinnery, told the court: ‘It’s right that she was in a relationship with Sarah Anderson at a time when she was vulnerable.’ Jacqueline Samuels, for Anderson, who is now serving her time at HMP Bronzefield, added: ‘The offence for which she was convicted occurred when she was 25, she was involved in a violent incident with another girl which resulted in that girl’s murder. ‘This defendant has always protested her innocence and there is a possibility of another appeal.’ Anderson, a hair-dresser by trade and mother to a 12-year-old son, was ‘desperately depressed’ when King-Chinnery befriended her. Ms Samuels said: 'She willingly became involved in this situation. ‘(King-Chinnery) sent numerous love letters, and in return, this defendant sent letters. ‘She is genuinely distressed by the way things worked out and the fact that the co-defendant may have had a relationship with someone else as well.’ King-Chinnery admitted two counts of misconduct in a public office. Anderson admitted causing the transmission of a sound or image from prison.","Sophia King-Chinnery had relationship with inmate Sarah Anderson .

International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced Britain is to almost treble to £1.8 billion a year the amount of foreign aid devoted to boosting emerging economies . Someof the biggest names on the High Street are to be handed British aid money to improve conditions for their foreign suppliers. Retail giants such as Tesco, Asda and Marks & Spencer will be  eligible for grants to help improve the lives of the Third World farmers and manufacturers who supply their stores. But critics questioned why some of Britain’s most successful and highly profitable firms are being given taxpayers’ cash for projects they could easily fund themselves. Schemes include cash for budget clothing chain Primark to improve conditions in Bangladesh’s notorious sweatshops. Primark – along with Debenhams and Asda – will be funded to run an initiative to ‘improve the management of garment factories’. And John Lewis, River Island and Morrisons will receive cash for a scheme to help Bangladeshi factories ‘rapidly meet labour and safety standards’. The initiatives follow the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory complex in Bangladesh last year, which claimed more than 1,100 lives. More than 40 Western retailers, including Primark, are thought to have sourced clothing from the giant plant. The controversial projects come amid mounting criticism that Britain’s overseas aid programme – which is set to hit more than £12billion this year – is already unjustifiable at a time of domestic spending cuts. The amount the UK government hands out is due to rise from £8billion in order to hit a target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, but critics believe it is too high while spending on schools and hospitals is being squeezed at home. In a speech at the London Stock Exchange yesterday, International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the move was part of a wider push to focus more of the aid budget on economic development. This would boost long-term trade, from which Britain could benefit, she said. But Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘It is quite extraordinary, and quite wrong, to be subsidising big companies in this way. Primark will work with Debenhams and Asda to improve the management of clothing factories in Bangladesh . ‘I think ordinary taxpayers will be very surprised indeed to find they are subsidising the likes of Tesco and Asda to improve conditions for their suppliers. ‘These companies should be improving their supply chains because it’s the right thing to do, not because they are going to get a Government grant to do it. ‘It’s another example of the problems you get when you set an arbitrary target for spending money on aid – you end up spending it for the sake of it.’ Robert Oxley, campaign director of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, described the scheme as a ‘totally inappropriate’ use of public money. Marks and Spencer will 'develop the leadership and management skills of farm workers' in Kenya and South Africa while Sainsbury’s will help workers gain qualifications . He said the initiative was a form of . ‘corporate welfare’, with taxpayers’ cash being used to help salve the . consciences of corporations that are sometimes accused of exploiting . suppliers in the developing world. Mr Oxley said: ‘The aid budget is meant to help the world’s poorest, not provide corporate welfare across the globe.’ Miss Greening said a number of leading firms had already signed up to the £4million Trade in Global Value Chains Initiative. Asda, . a subsidiary of the American retail giant Walmart, the world’s second . biggest public corporation, has already put forward two proposals. Marks . & Spencer will receive money for a project to develop the . ‘leadership and management skills’ of farm workers in Kenya and South . Africa. Another initiative will see Sainsbury’s establish an ‘innovative radio show’ for farmers in Kenya.Tesco . and Asda will be given grants to help pay for the training of ‘young . fruit farm workers from disadvantaged backgrounds in South Africa’. A rescue worker stands in front of the rubble of the collapsed Rana Plaza clothing factory building in Bangladesh in April 2013 . The . firms are eligible for grants of up to £750,000 each to help pay for . projects. In return they have to provide a similar amount of their own . money. A source at the . Department for International Development (Dfid) last night said the . scheme would help 700,000 workers in the developing world and insisted . the department was not subsidising wealthy corporations. ‘None . of this money is invested in the companies themselves,’ the source . said. ‘Instead, it is invested in development projects that would not . otherwise get off the ground.’ Critics claim Dfid has a patchy record on boosting economic development.

Payout: Tracy Godwin has won compensation four years after her 1lb son Tom died in her arms . A mother whose baby died in her arms after medical staff refused to resuscitate him has won compensation from the hospital. Tracy Godwin, 34, gave birth to Tom, weighing just 1lb, after 22 weeks of pregnancy. As his condition deteriorated, she pleaded with the midwives to revive him. But staff at Southend University Hospital in Essex refused and he died 46 minutes later. Although NHS guidelines make it compulsory to resuscitate babies born after 23-25 weeks of pregnancy, hospitals determine their own policy for babies born earlier. Southend Hospital does not resuscitate . babies born after 22 weeks unless the mother asks them to. Now, after a four-year court battle, Ms Godwin has won a legal claim for damages from the hospital trust. Her case has also made it compulsory for staff to read out their policies to expecting mothers before the birth. Today, Ms Godwin, an accounts assistant from Southend, said : 'I had many unanswered questions concerning my treatment and the death of my baby, which caused me to become severely depressed and unable to work. 'I was left alone, desperate and helpless to alleviate the suffering of my baby boy. 'I was given no guidance or warning on the hospital’s treatment of very premature births.' Ms Godwin went into labour with Tom, her first child, in March 2010 after just 22 weeks of pregnancy. She gave birth three days after first experiencing labour pains and was warned her baby was unlikely to survive because he was so premature. But when he was born alive, she urged staff to take him to a special care unit. As no consultant was present, nurses refused. She was then informed that resuscitating her baby was against hospital guidelines. New rules: Midwives at Southend hospital are now duty-bound to read out their policies to expecting mothers . She discovered that babies born following between 23 and 25 weeks of pregnancy are routinely resuscitated, but it is up to individual NHS trusts to decide their own policy regarding babies born at just 22 or 23 weeks. Ms Godwin said she had not been informed of this policy. Since the tragedy, she has given birth to a daughter, Isla, who was born at 24 weeks. Southend Hospital’s chief nurse, Sue Hardy, said in a statement today: 'Once again we offer our sincere condolences to Ms Godwin on the loss of her baby, and are again sorry that her experience of care did not meet the high standard we strive to provide. 'It is essential that we inform prospective parents of premature babies the expectations for their infant’s survival between 20 and 24 weeks’ gestation.

PC Ellie Murphy, 21, spent two years volunteering as a special constable before joining the full-time force. She graduated from Hendon Police College on January 17 and is now a Met Police officer - where one of her colleagues is 6ft 7in. The minimum height requirement for police, which stood in place for years in the UK, has been scrapped. Ellie Murphy and Martyn Evans are two of the Metropolitan Police's latest recruits. She is the smallest officer in the UK's largest force, towered over by fellow new officer Martyn Evans who is 18 inches taller. Britain’s shortest copper is PC Robin Port, 29, of Devon and Cornwall Police, who stands at 5ft. A spokesperson for the Met police said: 'PC Ellie Murphy is attached to Twickenham Borough, aged 21 - she is 5ft 1in tall. 'She joined the police after two years as a Special in Kingston.' Martyn Evans is attached to Enfield Borough - he's 30 and 6ft 7 in tall. In the past, male recruits had to be . at least 5ft 10in and women 5ft 4in to join many forces.

The NHS employs staff from more than 200 different countries, including Azerbaijan, Zambia, Indonesia, Poland, and American Samoa, according to official figures. The records, recorded by the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that more than 1 in 10 workers are from overseas, including 25 per cent of doctors and 11 per cent of nurses. India is the biggest supplier of staff with 18,424, followed by the Philippines with 12,744, then Ireland and 12,613 and Poland, with 5,507. Investigations have revealed that 40 out of 105 NHS trusts in the UK have actively recruited hospital staff from overseas . Lesser well known countries supplying staff include Guatamala, Kazakhstan, Sierra Leone and Timor. Figures from the study show that a total of 204 different nations, excluding the UK, supply the NHS with 136,624 workers. Some of Britain's doctors have warned that foreign staff do not always understand our healthcare system or culture, and often have a poor grasp of the language. These doctors include Lord Winston, a fertility doctor who warned on the reliance of staff from different countries, saying they had often been trained in a 'completely different way'. In addition, Professor J Meirion Thomas, a senior cancer specialist who works at Marsden Hospital in London, implied that junior doctors from overseas might not be of as high a standard. The NHS employ staff from more than 200 foreign countries, which has put them under fire from medical professionals who believe that workers from overseas might not understand UK healthcare systems or culture . Busy emergency rooms could be threatened by staff that do not have a good enough grasp of the English language, but a halt on overseas hiring with the UK's lack of trained staff could cause the system to grind to a halt . However, Tim Finch, working at a think tank for the Institute for Public Policy Research pointed out that the health service would struggle to function without the high numbers of overseas workers. He said: 'People are still attracted to work in the NHS. 'Without them we'd clearly be short - it would be hard to replace that number overnight. 'If the single thread of immigration policy is just to get the overall figure down by any means, you've got to look at the consequences of that on the NHS.' In addition, speaking about doctors from overseas, a spokesman for the British Medical Association said: 'Overseas doctors have for many years made a valuable and important contribution to the NHS, especially in key . services where there has been a historic shortage of UK trained . doctors. A member of medical think tank has said that the NHS could collapse if they stopped recruiting from abroad . â€˜This includes consultant posts in emergency care, . haematology and old age psychiatry. Without the support of these doctors . many NHS services would struggle to provide effective care to their . patients. â€˜It is essential that doctors treating patients in the . UK are subject to proper checks on their language skills and clinical . competence. â€˜For many years the NHS actively encouraged overseas . doctors to move to the UK, many of whom committed to a life here and . have since become British citizens.' Separate data from last year from . the General Medical Council watchdog showed that the NHS recruits . doctors from 143 different countries, including the nations of Liberia, . Belize and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In . addition, an investigation last October found that one in three . hospitals are turning to overseas countries for recruitment, including Poland, .

Narval Johnson, 62, sparked a bomb scare when he sent a council threatening letters containing curry powder . A man who sparked a bomb scare when he sent threatening letters containing curry powder to his local council walked free from court today. Narval Johnson, 62, sent two envelopes containing coriander powder, garlic and black pepper to Wolverhampton City Council. When the letters arrived in the building's mail room, staff feared the packages contained explosive Semtex - so removed them to a carpark. They then evacuated and called police to inspect the contents. Johnson, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, who sent the letters as he was unhappy paying bills, admitted sending a total of 24 letters over a two month period but said it was just 'a joke'. He . denied a charge of sending a threatening letter for the purpose of . causing distress or anxiety but was found guilty after a trial on . January 3 this year. Johnson - who had worked for tyre retailer Goodyear for 27 years - was spared jail when he appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates Court on Friday. Sentencing Johnson to a 12-week prison term suspended for two years, chairman of the bench Stephen Russell said: 'This is a very serious offence. The mere fact that you did this with innocuous material does not mitigate that fact. 'The people in the post room who received it were upset and potentially afraid. 'If you stay out of trouble nothing else will happen to you but if you do anything criminal again with the two years of the order you will almost certainly be sent to prison.' The court heard many of his 24 threatening letters were addressed to ‘Satan People’ and had the number 666 written on them. In one letter, Johnson - who was of previous good character - claimed he was owed £3 trillion in compensation by various agencies. The package which sparked the scare comprised of two manila envelopes taped together, one of which was covered with crudely drawn crucifixes. As well as the curry powder, one of the envelopes contained cut up bank cards and had written on one side: ‘To Barclaycard white old man’ and on the other: ‘All your s*** is inside’. Two of the letters contained coriander powder, pictured, as well as garlic and black pepper. Staff feared the substance may be explosives . Prosecutor Roger Bleazard said: 'The hand writing on the package matched that of the person who had sent the threatening letters. 'This, coupled with its unusual smell, caused concern and distress. The explosive Semtex has a strange smell. 'If this had happened at a university during Rag Week without any background it might have been treated differently but this was at a council on alert because of terrorist concerns.' The man sent a total of 24 letters to staff at Wolverhampton City Council (office pictured) as he was unhappy about paying bills. He received a 12-week suspended sentence for the crime . Defending Johnson, Mrs Bally Paul said he had sent the package as an ‘insult’ to Barclays and the council, adding that the distinctive smell of curry powder should have been enough to know it was not a threat. He added: 'There was no report to the police about these letters until after the package had been received. He sent it out as an insult and then things got out of control. 'He has now tarnished his good name.'","Narval Johnson, 62, sent threatening letters to Wolverhampton City Council .

Patrice Biancone, her ex chief of staff, who is also on the trip told reporters: ‘She has not become an ordinary citizen, she is an ex first lady, which gives her a different status.’ Ms Trierweiler will certainly have her work cut out changing her image in a country where she is massively unpopular. Le . Monde today writes: ‘She became one of the most detested personalities . of the French’, while a new book was set to portray her as a calculating . mistress. Written by the photographer Pascal Rostain, an old . friend, it recalls how she borrowed a flat off him in 2007 to use as a . love nest. At the time, Mr Hollande was officially living with .

Kevin Green, who pleaded guilty to stealing diesel from Andrew Woodhouse's tyre yard, claims he is the victim after Mr Woodhouse was cleared of assaulting him . A thief has criticised the justice system for 'letting him down' after the victim who battered him was cleared of assault. Unemployed Kevin Green, 53, suffered two broken legs and a broken arm when landscape gardener Andrew Woodhouse attacked him and his son-in-law as they fled his business premises. Green and Tim Cross, 32, had stolen diesel from Mr Woodhouse's tyre yard, prompting the father-of-five to chase the pair and perform a citizen's arrest. But Green told Emma Foster at The Sun he is the 'real' victim, adding that no one understands the pain and suffering he has been subjected to. He said he is plagued by nightmares over the incident and is now unable to go fishing or walk his dogs after his injuries rendered him housebound. 'He went at me like a madman hitting me with a stick - all over 50 quid's worth of diesel,' he said. 'I'm the victim in all this. I don't think he realises what suffering I had to go through, which is ten times more than him.' Mr Woodhouse, 44, has been battling a spate . of crime at his company - and sprang into action when his alarm rang . after midnight as the thieves were stealing diesel. Mr Woodhouse grabbed a fence post one was carrying as a weapon - and used it to fight back against them. He was shocked to be charged with using . excessive force in his citizen's arrest - and hauled to court four times . before being cleared by a 12-strong jury at Cardiff Crown Court last week. Mr Woodhouse runs a machinery and tyre depot two miles from his home near . Abergavenny, South Wales, which have been plagued by criminals. Mr Woodhouse was cleared of two counts of grievous bodily harm by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court. He was alerted by an alarm at his business premises in Llanfoist in South Wales last March . He said he has repeatedly been a victim of crime at his . gardening company costing him £30,000 over the past five years. Mr Woodhouse . was woken in the middle of the night by a text message telling him a . burglar alarm had gone off at the tyre yard where he runs his business. Mr Woodhouse was in bed with his wife Lisa at their detached home in the village ofGovilon, near Abergavenny, when his burglar alarm went off at about 12.30am. Green and his son-in-law Timothy Cross, pictured, were fined £75 by magistrates . The alarm is fitted to his business premises on an industrial estate a mile from his six-bedroom £350,000 home. Mr Woodhouse drove to the premises where he disturbed two men stealing stealing diesel from his machinery. The court heard officers found Green lying injured under a blanket - and Cross claiming the businessmen had gone 'over the top'. He proclaimed he was fully justified in keeping hold of the two burglars until police arrived. The . thieves ended up with £75 fines - but businessman Woodhouse could have . faced a sentence of life imprisonment if he had been found guilty. Green and Cross tried to escape into a neighbouring field with jerry cans full of stolen fuel. But . Mr  Woodhouse chased Green - and caught him near their getaway car. He then . attacked Green leaving him with two broken legs and a broken arm. He then chased Cross before rugby-tackling him. He lay on top of the raider until police arrived. Green claimed he did not steal anything despite pleading guilty to theft and being fined £75. 'I regret what happened that night but it makes me angry he's been turned into some sort of celebrity. He should have been punished.' After being cleared at Cardiff Crown . Court, a relieved Mr Woodhouse said: 'The verdicts show we have a . criminal justice that works. 'When people act to defend themselves and their property it will not be considered unlawful. 'The last 10 months have been very harrowing for me, my family and the people I employ.' He said he was 'gutted and sickened' to learn the extent of Green's injuries. Mr Woodhouse employs six staff including two of his sons at the family business, which was set up 20 years ago. The court heard how he didn't feel like officers had given him enough assistance when he had been the victim of crime. Green and Cross were charged with theft and later given £75 fines by magistrates. Mr Woodhouse had denied grievous bodily harm and grievous bodily harm with intent. A Facebook page set up in his support saw 4,000 people give him their backing. Mr Woodhouse's eldest son, marine Josh, 24, said afterwards: 'This prosecution should never have been brought. 'My father was doing what every right-minded person would do- protecting his family and his property. 'The stress it's caused him and the whole family has been unbelievable.'","Kevin Green suffered two broken legs and a broken arm as he fled theft .

Lib Dem councillor Eleanor Scott has quit the group in Portsmouth in protest at the party's handling of the Mike Hanock allegations . A senior Lib Dem councillor has quit the party group over its handling of allegations against MP Mike Hancock. Eleanor Scott resigned from the Lib Dem group on Portsmouth City Council, accusing her party of turning the scandal into a 'game show'. It comes as the party effectively deselected Mr Hancock, announcing it was looking for a candidate to stand in the 2015 election. Nick Clegg’s leadership faced a fresh . crisis last week after revelations that Mr Hancock . sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent. Mr Clegg said the first he . knew about the crisis was when he saw a report by an independent QC into . the claims. The party only suspended Mr Hancock last week, three years after allegations against him first surfaced. Mr Hancock, who denies any wrongdoing, . resigned the party whip in parliament last year, but was still sitting . as a Lib Dem local councillor. After . a Hampshire police investigation concluded there was no case to answer, . Portsmouth City Council launched an inquiry into whether Mr Hancock had . breached the council's code of conduct, but that has now been put on . hold pending the outcome of the civil court action. The . report, carried out by Nigel Pascoe QC for the council, found . ‘compelling’ evidence of ‘serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour’ towards a vulnerable woman constituent. She suffered a mental health disorder and had been sexually abused as a child. Now Cllr Scott, who has represented Fratton - the same ward as Mr Hancock - since 2002, has resigned from the Lib Dem group on the council in protest. She told the Mail: ‘I remain a Liberal Democrat Party member, and committed to being a councillor and Portsmouth. ‘I hope that others involved in the Group’s decision On Friday will reflect on their positions, and do the right thing. We need to run a city, not a game show.' Cllr . Scott added: ‘I have previously raised concerns with Liberal Democrat . Party headquarters in London, and I trust that they will concede that . they need to give me, and others here, support to clean out the Augean . Stables.’ Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock, pictured leaving his home in Porchester, Hampshire, is accused of making unwanted advances towards a constituent . Other Lib Dems in Portsmouth have . continued to voice support for Mr Hancock, accusing the party leadership . of suspending him without due process. On Friday Mr Clegg insisted he had taken firm action against Mr Hanock: ‘When I was given the . specific allegations at the beginning of last year I immediately asked . our chief whip to investigate. As a result Mike Hancock ceased to be a . Lib Dem MP. ‘When those . allegations were then supported by the QC's report that has come to . light this week again we acted immediately and Mike Hancock has been . suspended from the Lib Dems altogether.’ However, today it emerged that the woman who has made claims against Mr Hancock wrote to Mr Clegg in March 2011, saying: 'He cannot be trusted and he is a liability to women, public and also your party. Stop the behaviour from him and his staff and whoever is involved with Mr Hancock as this is holy wrong. And please reply to this letter as it is very important to me that I get answers from you.' A leaked tape recording shows Number 10 staff confirming the letter had been released and it would be passed on to Mr Clegg's political office. Now the party has moved to effectively de-select Mr Hancock. The local Liberal Democrat group has announced they are in the process of selecting a candidate for the next general election. Simon Dodd, chairman of Portsmouth Liberal Democrats, has said that although the local party believed Mr Hancock had the right to respond to the allegations against him, they were still considering his future. He said: 'The Executive has clearly reconfirmed its belief in natural justice and the right of Mike Hancock to fully respond in due course to the allegations made against him. We reiterate our belief that it is for the court to reach its conclusions based on all the evidence. 'The Executive is continuing the process of selecting parliamentary candidates for Portsmouth North and Portsmouth South constituencies to stand at the general election in May 2015 and will be continuing our efforts to contest all wards in the city in the upcoming elections in May 2014.' But Mr Hancock insisted he would not be forced out by the party. He told Portsmouth newspaper The News: 'I'll make the decision whether I stand as an MP or not when I decide, not when people are trying to make a decision when they know it will be impossible for me to be involved in it. 'I don't think that it's a very fair thing to do. I'd have thought they at least owed me that to wait for the civil case.' Meanwhile Mr Clegg continues to face questions about his handling of allegations against Lord Rennard, the former chief executive who denies inappropriate behaviour towards female activists. Fear: Friends of the embattled Lord Rennard have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party . Friends of the embattled peer have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party. Lord Rennard - who has denied allegations of sexual harassment - could go ‘nuclear’ if party leader Nick Clegg stops him from re-joining the party. Lord Rennard became active with the Lib Dems as an orphaned teen and has devoted his entire life to the party. Now friends feel he has been treated ‘cruelly’ and could retaliate if he is shut out permanently. He could reveal secrets, such as claims like that of a former MP who was known to be a persistent sex pest, the liaison between a Lib Dem peer and married MP, and details of gay affairs between peers and MPs, according to the Sunday Times. A spokesman for Lord Rennard declined to comment last night. The Lib Dem peer has kept silent in the last few days, as have the women who made allegations against him. According to one source, he has a ‘little black book’ filled with many politician and activists’ darkest secrets. The Lib Dem, who did not wish to be named, said that most of in the party ‘lived in fear’ of the Svengali-like figure because their careers - and family life - depended on him. The source said: ‘He is often offered up as a shoulder to cry on so everyone has off-loaded their skeletons on to him. But he has all their dirty little secrets apparently stored in a little black book. It’s no wonder that it’s taken ten years for anyone to confront him.’ Crisis management: Lord Rennard was also at the centre of managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that Mark Oaten (left) had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of Lord Ashdown (right) Lord Rennard was also at the centre of . managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that former MP Mark . Oaten had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of Lord Ashdown . when he was party leader.

Another Lib Dem source revealed: ‘He is the mastermind of many of the dirty tricks campaigns during elections that we have, rightly or wrongly, become known for. Loyal: Lord Rennard became active with the Lib Dems as an orphaned teen and has devoted his entire life to the party . He once suggested printing a . photograph of an opponent’s house on a leaflet to point out that he did . not live in the constituency.

An iconic British manufacturing giant that dates back to 1887 has been sold to an American investor. A majority share in bread and flour firm Hovis, which is best known for its nostalgic advert featuring a boy pushing a bicycle up a hill, has been sold by cash-strapped Premier Foods to US investment firm The Gores Group for £30million. The move safeguard's the future of the firm, which has spent the past six years selling off assets, but it is a blow to British manufacturing, which has lost several iconic brands to overseas investors recently. Scroll down for video . Hovis, the iconic British bread manufacturer dating back more than 125 years, has been sold to US investors . In 2010 chocolate producer Cadbury was sold to American giant Kraft Foods for £12billion, and last year Weetabix was sold to China's state-owned Bright Foods for £1.2billion. Hovis' previous parent firm, Premier Foods, which employs around 9,000 staff in the UK, has sold a 51 per cent stake in Hovis to the Americans, and will keep the rest. Despite having spent the past six years selling off assets, Premier still has a pension deficit and debt pile of £1.3billion, but bosses there say the deal is good news for the business. Premier chief executive officer Gavin Darby said today: 'We believe it's a win-win for both halves of our business. They say the cash injection for Hovis will be reinvested in its grocery brands including Mr Kipling cakes. Premier plans to invest about £20million in a new line for Snack Pack cake slices at a factory in Carlton, Barnsley. The two parties are locked into the venture for at least three years. The iconic British bread brand is best known for its Ridley Scott-directed advertisement, Boy on the Bike . Hovis - the name comes from the Latin 'hominis vis', meaning strength of a man, began in the late 1880s when Richard Smith found a way to cook bread with its wheatgerm without losing any of its nutritional value. He teamed up with Macclesfield miller Thomas Fitton, and in 1887 they registered Smith's Patent Process Germ Flour. The name was deemed too much of a mouthful, so in 1890 they staged a national competition to come up with a name.  A man named Herbert Grime suggested the winning name, Hovis, and the bakers not only gave him his £25 prize but also gave his wife an annual pension after Mr Grime's death. By 1895 sales of Hovis had exceeded one million loaves per week, and the firm's sales were boosted further when, in 1924, scientists discovered that there was Vitamin B in wheatgerm. In 1973, an advertisement for the bread directed by Oscar-winning film director, Ridley Scott, boosted the bread firm's fortunes further.  The 'boy on the bike' advertisment, featuring a small boy pushing a bike up a cobbled hill in Dorset, was later voted Britain's favourite television advert.","A 51 per cent share of the brand is sold to US investors The Gores Group .

Mitt Romney has criticised President Barack Obama's presence on the world stage - claiming he has been outperformed by Russian President Vladimir Putin 'time and time again'. The former Masssachusetts Governor suggested that America's stature on the international political scene has 'diminished' in recent months while Russia has managed to 'elevate' its position. Romney, who was beaten by Mr Obama in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, gave the damning verdict during an interview with NBC. Scroll down to watch video . Critical: Mitt Romney has claimed Barack Obama is being 'outperformed' by Russian President Vladimir Putin 'again and again' on the world stage . Unflattering verdict: Romney claimed America's stature on the international political scene has diminished while President Barack Obama, pictured left, has been in power while Russia's has elevated under Putin . He said: 'I think most observers of the international political scene suggest that Russia has elevated itself in stature and America has been diminished.' Mr Romney, who managed the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, just months after the September 11 terrorist attacks, made the comments as he expressed his confidence the Sochi Winter Olympics will be safe for visitors. Mr Romney added he would have no qualms about taking his own family to Russia to watch the Games. In spite of the anti-Russian rhetoric he adopted during the 2012 campaign, Mr Romney was also very complimentary of the Russian government’s efforts to secure the site. He said: ‘There's never been a Games that I know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you're seeing at Sochi. At the same time, the level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level. ‘I believe the Games will be safe. That doesn’t mean there’s a 100 per cent guarantee anywhere in the world today. But this is, after all, a dangerous corner of the world. Speaking of the past: Mitt Romney was in charge of the Salt Lake City Olympic Games in Utah in 2002, just months after the September 11 terrorist attacks, and said Russia seems to be handling security threats well . ‘The specific threats that have been leveled suggest that this is an area that could be targeted and therefore there's a degree of risk associated with, well frankly life today in a world where terrorism exists.’ Romney said that while the warnings about the Black Widow terrorists and other specific women that appear to pose a threat to the safety of the Games may come as shocking and scary to some, he sees them as examples of the efficiency of the organizers. ‘Extraordinary intelligence work - that's what happened with our Games that gave me confidence that they'd be safe,’ he said. ‘Now and then we'll hear reports of an individual they're looking for - that suggests they have pretty good intelligence so all in all, it seems to be a very effective security program, but again, no 100 per cent guarantee.’ Changing tune: In spite of his harsh rhetoric against Russia during the 2012 campaign, Romney said that they were taking ever possible precaution in the lead up to the Sochi Games . One point that he parsed out was that he has a high level of confidence of the security at the ‘hard sites’ where the physical events will take place, keeping the athletes and spectators safe during the tournaments, but soft sites will remain an issue - just as they do throughout the world- because there is no way for security officials to check everyone in public areas. ‘Terrorists can move almost wherever they want to go. It only takes one person to go through a sieve of some kind and so a place like Sochi can be surrounded if you will,’ Mr Romney said. ‘I think that people can recognize that the hard sites and the athletes will be safe and spectators when they're in the venues will be safe but it’s the soft places that you can’t be 100 per cent certain will be entirely safe, but my guess is that Russians have done everything humanly possible to protect the Games.’ He maintained that while he still views Russia as a ‘geopolitical adversary’ of the United States and the world since ‘their friends are some of the world's worst actors’ that is not justification enough to keep the Games away from the country.

A schoolboy with a fractured skull was rushed to hospital after falling off his bicycle only for doctors give him painkillers and send him home twice before realising the seriousness of his injury. Matthew King's relatives have said the 13-year-old could have died if he was left untreated for much longer. The teenager injured his head while playing with friends at the Silksworth skate park in Sunderland and was taken to the A&E department of Sunderland Royal Hospital after his worried friends called 999. Injured: Matthew King, pictured left with his brother Mitchell, was rushed to hospital with a fractured skull after falling off his bike, only to be sent home with painkillers twice . Although Matthew was kept in overnight, his family said he was not given an X-ray. They were told he had concussion and given painkillers to treat him. 'He was in an awful lot of pain, we just knew there was something not right,' said his grandmother Pauline King, 56. 'He couldn't remember coming off his bike, and he was also being sick, which is a sign there is a problem. 'But when we took him to the hospital they didn't even give him an x-ray.' Matthew, of Grangetown, North Yorkshire, was sent home the following morning, but his mother Claire became increasingly worried about him as he appeared to be no better and was vomiting. She then called for an ambulance to take him back to hospital and Matthew was admitted back onto the ward for a few hours of observation. However, he was again discharged and was once again told to take the painkillers.

Unusual fear: Diane Freelove, 49, from Rochester, cannot bear the smell, touch or even sight of newspapers . A woman who developed a fear of newspapers after watching her mother hit her father over the head with one has told how her unusual phobia affects her life every day. Diane Freelove, 49, cannot bear the smell of newspapers, hates to touch them, and cannot even look at them. The mother-of-three from Rochester, Kent, has suffered from a rare condition known as chloephobia for the last 25 years. It means even a visit to the shops is an ordeal for the care home kitchen assistant. Mrs Freelove said: 'When I visit a shop I walk as far away as I can from the newsstand. I can’t go anywhere near someone who has got a newspaper, and if they approach me, I freak out. 'At one time I could touch a newspaper as long as I knew I could wash my hands thoroughly afterwards, but now I can’t even look at them.' She added: 'I don't like the feel of them - if I touch a newspaper it feels like my skin is crawling, and I can’t stand the smell, which I think is quite strong and distinctive. 'If I see a newspaper flash up on TV, I have to physically turn away.' Mrs Freelove, whose children are grown up, suspects the root of her fear lies in uncomfortable memories from her childhood. She said: 'When I was a child, my mother hit my father over the head with a newspaper. She did it in a playful, friendly way, but it worried me. 'I became afraid of newspapers gradually over the past 25 years.  At first I hated it when the newsprint rubbed off on my hands, feeling as if my hands were very dirty, meaning I would have to wash them. 'Today, I just think newspapers feel horrible.' Mrs Freelove, who has a sign on her door asking for newspapers not to be delivered through her letterbox, said she winces when she catches her son, Matthew, 29 and daughters Lauren, 24 and Rebecca, 19, enjoying the daily news. She said: 'All my children like to read newspapers. My daughter has them delivered to her house but is careful to throw them away before I go over to visit her. 'They made fun of me at first, but now they realise I have a serious problem. They understand it is a genuine issue for me. Warning: Mrs Freelove, a widower since her newspaper-loving husband, Ian, died, has a sign on her door . 'My younger daughter, who lives with me, has to go out and read the papers in secret. If I know she has touched a paper when she comes home she has to wash her hands and clothes.' Mrs Freelove, who reads the news online, says she regularly bought newspapers for her late husband, Ian, who died in 2011, but always used gloves and a plastic bag to pick them up. She said: 'I would go into the newsagent, pay for the newspaper first and ask if it could be left aside at the counter. Then I would do the rest of my shopping and collect the paper at the end. I would pick it up wearing my gloves and then pull the bag over it. 'I was very careful not to touch it. I could never even attempt that now. 'As my husband read the paper, I left the room and went to an open window in the kitchen. Fresh air made my anxiety more bearable. The mother-of-three's younger daughter still lives at home but must wash her clothes if she's read a paper . 'Ian realised how much I hated it and he stopped buying the papers. I always felt bad about that because he loved reading the paper.' Mrs Freelove says she understands that her phobia is not an ordinary fear. 'I have some ordinary fears as well - I am scared of spiders and heights - but for some reason I’m also scared of newspapers,' she said. 'I saw someone put a newspaper in their mouth once. It was one of the worst things I had ever seen. It made me feel sick, as if I was watching someone put a spider in their mouth. 'I have thought about trying hypnotherapy to overcome my fear but I haven’t gone down that route yet.' Scary?  If you're frightened of this, you may suffer from the comparatively rare turophobia, or fear of cheese . More than a fear of something, a phobia is a type of anxiety disorder which means the sufferer has an overwhelming need to avoid avoid all contact with the source of their anxiety. Some phobias, such as arachnophobia, or fear of spiders, are more common than others, while others, such as these below, are more unusual. Papyrophobia:  Fear of paper . Bibliophobia:  Fear of books . Euphobia:  Fear of hearing good news . Turophobia:  Fear of cheese . Coulrophobia:  Fear of clowns . Aulophobia:  Fear of flutes .

Police officers have warned people to keep their pets indoors until it has been found.

'She is a very strong bird but she's so gentle and relaxed. In winter we are a lot quieter and so we let her fly. She's normally only gone for a few hours at a time but we've not seen Nikita since Saturday now. 'I think the windy weather has probably blown her off track. Letting her have a few hours of freedom is very important for her training but it's not normal for her to be gone so long. 'She's a home bird and I imagine she'll be sitting somewhere waiting for me to come and pick her up. 'The weather doesn't help either. It's rained a lot and so she's more likely to be taking shelter rather than flying, which means she'll be harder to spot. 'She'll be sitting there watching the world go by wishing she was back home.' Bird of prey: Chris O'Donnell flies his Steller's sea eagle Nikita during an event at Warwick Castle . Mr O'Donnell, who has trained Nikita since she was just two years old, said there have been two reported sightings since she went missing. 'Two people have called me claiming they've seen her in York but I don't think they'll be her,' he said. 'The public can get a little excited over these things. They said they were fleeting glances so I think it's more likely that they were herons. 'You'd know if you saw Nikita because she is so huge.' Nikita's trainer says the raptor will be wishing she was safe and at home . The majestic predators, which are native to east Russia, can go up to two weeks without food so Mr O'Donnell said he isn't worried. 'She'll be very fit and healthy wherever she and she won't need food for weeks,' he added. 'I just want to get her home. 'She's not fitted with a transmitter because she could just rip it off with her beak in seconds so we can't track her. 'She's used to eating frozen pigeons and rabbits so biting into a transmitter would be a piece of cake.' North Yorkshire Police has asked anyone who spots the bird to call 101. 'If this turns up on your bird table you're going to call the police,' Mr O'Donnell added.","Nikita, a Steller's sea eagle, flew away from trainers on Saturday .

Washington was considering ‘targeted sanctions against those who further . destabilize the situation, or pursue their own selfish ends by abetting . or encouraging the violence’.

He called on the country’s leaders to halt attacks on civilians and to condemn the violence. Almost one million people have been displaced by fighting that began when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the majority Christian former French colony in March. Christian groups, known as ""anti-balaka"", or anti-machete, have since taken up arms against Muslims, with the U.N. estimating that more than 2,000 people have been killed in the last ten months. French and African Union peacekeeping troops have so failed to stem the bloodshed. Kerry said the appointment of new interim President Catherine Samba-Panza last week was a chance to move forward. She replaced Michel Djotodia, a former Seleka leader, who stepped down earlier in the month because of intense international pressure. Samba-Panza has said she will aim to start talks between armed groups and called for militia to lay down their weapons. A witness told the Reuters News Agency he saw two burning bodies in Bagui’s Castor district. A convoy of heavily armed rebel Seleka Muslim fighters was seen leaving Bangui Sunday.

A North Carolina man was billed $80,000 for an 18-hour hospital stay last summer after being bitten by a snake - and almost all of the bill was for anti-venom. Eric Furguson, 54, of Mooresville, was shocked when he received the massive bill from Lake Norman Regional Medical Center attributing more than $81,000 of the cost to a four-vial dose of anti-venom. He told the Charlotte Observer he was able to find the same anti-venom online at prices ranging from $750 to 12,000 per vial, a staggering difference for which they demanded an explanation. Sticker shock: Laura and Eric Ferguson were surprised after receiving their almost $90,000 bill from Lake Norman Regional Medical Center . Mr Ferguson’s health insurance through Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina reduced the total bill from Lake Norman Regional Medical Center to just over $20,000, of which he paid a deductible of about $5,400 – but his wife worried about the cost of being uninsured. ‘What if it was someone that didn’t have the resources to research and didn’t have insurance?’ Wife Laura Ferguson wondered aloud to the paper. ‘What is fair and equitable here?’ When reached by the Observer, the hospital released a statement saying it rarely charges list prices.‘We are required to give Medicare one level of discount from list price, Medicaid another, and private insurers negotiate for still others,’ said the statement. ‘If we did not start with the list prices we have, we would not end up with enough revenue to remain in operation… Our costs for providing uncompensated care are partially covered by higher bills for other patients. Lake Norman Regional Medical Center: The hospital where the $90,000 bill was incurred last summer . ‘In some cases, Lake Norman Regional’s charge is considerably higher than other local hospitals,’ the statement continued, explaining that discounts of about 62 to 65 percent are offered to patients without insurance, according to the Observer. A lawsuit was filed in 2010 by doctors at Lake Norman and another local hospital accusing the medical facilities of offering kickbacks to doctors who could provide unnecessary treatment. Parent company Health Management Associates denied the allegations, but declined further comment. The Fergusons’ concern is not solitary. A Time magazine expose last year on the cost of medical care in the U.S. revealed Americans spend $2.8trillion a year – 20 per cent of Gross Domestic Product – on medical care.","Eric Ferguson was charged $20,000 each for four vials of anti-venom that he found online for as little as $750 each .

A Seattle Seahawks player has potentially left his team open to a $50,000 fine after storming out of the NFL's media day events well before the required 45 minutes were up. Running back Marshawn Lynch made an early exit from the Super Bowl event held today in Newark, New Jersey. The Seattle and Denver players were expected to speak to media members during the 45-minute sessions that lead up to the game, but Lynch only stayed for a few minutes before leaving. Scroll down for video . Clamming up: Marshawn Lynch, a running back for the Seattle Seahawks, spoke to very few reporters and stormed out of the media day ahead of the Super Bowl . Not wanting to be there: When he did return minutes later, Lynch spoke to only a select few members of the media and kept away from the hoards of others . He later came back and stood on the side of the media area, doing interviews with the Armed Forces Network, Deion Sanders for the NFL Network and a Seahawks Web reporter. Lynch also talked to teammates and signed footballs and a helmet for fans in the stands. While he did that, about five dozen media members stood in front of Lynch and shouted out questions. He ignored almost all of them as time ran out in Seattle's 45-minute availability. One reporter asked, 'Are you trying to avoid being fined by standing here?' Lynch twice nodded his head yes. Part of the deal: Members of each playoff team are meant to be available for 45 minutes of interviews on media day, as Lynch's teammates are seen here . Facing the press: Even Richard Sherman, who became the subject of much criticism following his on-field post game interview, participated fully in the media day events . Lynch watched as the clocked counted down to zero and, when it was announced the Seattle portion was over, left for good. Earlier this month, Lynch was fined $50,000 for not cooperating with the Seattle media. The NFL put the fine on hold, saying it would be rescinded if his behavior improved. 'Players are required to participate and he participated. We will continue to monitor the situation,' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Tuesday. Lynch has required media sessions Wednesday and Thursday. The Seahawks play the Denver Broncos on Sunday. At media day, Lynch was standing on the floor of the covered-over hockey rink among a cluster of about 100 reporters. There were eight podiums set up for Seattle stars and coach Pete Carroll, plus nine other separated areas separated from the throng. Lynch wasn't positioned at any of them. In action: Lynch is one of the team's top running backs and has a history of run-ins with the media .","Running back Marshawn Lynch stormed out of today's media requirements for Super Bowl players .

The sports caster, at times in tears during the 30-minute meeting, added: 'People told me that in time things would get better... Things have not gotten better... It became worse and worse.'

Police also reportedly dragged Remy from the murder scene covered in blood. Boston Red Sox second baseman turned broadcaster Jerry Remy will return this season . Remy's daughter has been in state custody since after the murder. 'She’s in a good place. She has a dog to play with, which makes me happy because she loves animals. I’m hoping she’s going to be a veterinarian one day,' her father said. Both Remy and Miss Marel's parents have petitioned for custody of the little girl. He also said he has no intention of contacting his daughter while he remains behind bars. 'If she chooses to know me at some point and wants to see me, that’s fine. If she doesn’t, that’s fine, too. I just want her to be happy. I love her. I want her to go to high school, I want her to go to college, I want her to have everything in life she  deserves,' he said. While Remy admitted his past steroid abuse, he said he'd stopped using them. 'I wasn’t currently taking them,' he said. Remy also expressed regret over the pain this is causing his famous father, as well as his mother. 'They’re very good people. I wish the media would leave them alone. None of this is their fault.

She would be alive today if they had put him away.' Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment to get her belongings before fleeing. 'She . went back to the house to go get stuff and that's when he killed her,' she said. 'And that's why he killed her, because she called the cops on . him.' At least one . neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid . and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved . his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said. 'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com.

It got worse in . the last few months but she never told me it was to the point where it . was this.' She said she was determined to take custody of her granddaughter. 'I . don't want him to get his hands on her. If he gets out that's the first . thing he's going to do is try to get her. He just traumatized his . daughter for the rest of her life.'.
