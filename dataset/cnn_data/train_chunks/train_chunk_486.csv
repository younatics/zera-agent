Sacrifice: Plamen Petkov, 32, died after diving into the sea after a mother cried for help to rescue her daughter . The devastated family of a hero who drowned at sea saving the life of a five-year-old girl have spoken of their immense pride. Plamen Petkov, 32, had been on a day out to the beach with a friend on Saturday at West Wittering, West Sussex when tragedy struck. His family said he rushed to the help of a mother who was shouting for help because her daughter was drifting out to sea on an inflatable ring. They said Mr Petkov - a British Citizen of Bulgarian origin - dived into the water ‘without second thoughts’, followed by his friend and another woman from Guildford, Surrey. But the hero, who was not related to the . youngster, had a suspected heart attack and drowned just 16ft from the shore . moments after delivering the unharmed child to safety. Shocked beachgogers attempted to save his life using CPR for 40 minutes before an air ambulance arrived. The family of Mr Petkov, an electrician who lived in Sutton, Surrey, said they welcomed calls by members of the public to award him with a posthumous honour for his bravery. In a statement they said: ‘We are all incredibly sad to have lost such a special person from our lives but we are also immensely proud that Plamen was able to save the life of this young child. ‘His display of concern for others was typical of the man we all knew and the way he lived his life. ‘Plamen always made time to help others, and as a family we have all been touched by his kindness and generosity which he displayed each day. ‘We are grateful for the messages of support from everyone Plamen came into contact with both in and out of work - he leaves a huge gap in our lives and will be missed by us all. ‘We would like to thank his friend and the woman for the huge effort they made to try to save Plamen’s life and to people for the kind comments made about Plamen and his part in returning the child safely to the shore. In vain: Lifeguards trying to resuscitate the man after he was rescued from the sea . The children rescued is pictured on the left and the body of the man who rescued her is in the middle surrounded by people . ‘In response to the many people who . have been moved by his brave act, the family would like to release his . name and picture to be commemorated. ‘We also appreciate suggestions to award Plamen with a posthumous honour for his actions.’ The . family have also called for stationed lifeguards on beaches with . dangerous waters to prevent similar tragedies in the future. In . their statement they added: ‘In these extremely difficult days, . Plamen’s family want to use this unfortunate opportunity to stress their . concern with the dangerous waters like those at West Wittering around . the UK coast and are keen to call for additional positive safety . measures to be put in place, such as stationed lifeguards, and to not . just rely on signage in order to prevent future tragedies of a similar . nature occurring again. ‘The . family are looking at how they might support the local community in . this area who share this concern in the hope that these changes might be . an appropriate way of honouring Plamen’s name and courageous act.’ The family issued their own version of events in the statement . They . said when Plamen reached the child, she jumped from the inflatable into . the arms of Plamen - who by this point was exhausted and trying to keep . the child’s head above water. The man, who was not related to the youngster, had a heart attack and drowned just 16ft from the shore in West Sussex . They . said Plamen’s friend was next to reach them. By this point Plamen was . holding the child above the water as he was being dragged under by the . current and his friend tried to pull him to the surface and helped to . support the child until the women arrived and took the child and swam . with her to the shore while Plamen’s friend brought him to the shore . unconscious. The family added when they arrived at the shore the woman started the attempt to resuscitate him with CPR until help arrived. The . family say the attempt continued for around 40 minutes until an air . ambulance arrived but they were unfortunately unable to save him. Plamen worked for Vulcan Building Services, based in Sutton, Surrey. Staff at the firm have been left stunned by his death and have been comforting his family. A . company spokesman said: ‘Plamen was an extremely conscientious and . hardworking person, who was universally liked and respected by both his . workmates and clients alike. ‘He . had always shown himself to be a thoughtful and caring man and while . the news of his death came as a terrible shock for everyone at the . company, the fact he tragically lost his life in a completely selfless . act to try and help somebody in trouble came as no surprise at all. ‘It was so typical of a person who had become a friend as well as a colleague to all of us, and he will be very sadly missed.’ The . spokesman added: ‘His actions are an outstanding example of what true . heroism is all about; ordinary people doing amazing things to help . others in trouble or less fortunate than themselves, without any thought . of the dangers involved and expecting nothing in return. ‘Unfortunately . for his family, friends and colleagues, Plamen has paid the highest . possible price for his bravery and the world is much poorer for his . passing. ‘Every member of staff would like to pass on their sincere and heartfelt condolences to his family at such a very sad time.’",Electrician Plamen Petkov died after racing into water 'without second thoughts'
"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 02:57 EST, 28 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:32 EST, 28 May 2012 . A young woman who was infected with a flesh-eating bacteria while on a zip line has spoken her first words since her fingers and foot amputated. Aimee Copeland's father Andy, who has kept a blog on her progress since she became ill, wrote online: 'Today… May 27… is AIMEE DAY!!! Today Aimee has finally spoken her first words. I will follow with details tonight.' The University of West Georgia graduate developed a rare condition called necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg when she fell from a homemade zip line over a river on May 1. Thrilled: Aimee, left with mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige, has delighted her family by speaking for the first time since her shocking extreme surgery . She had to have most of her left leg, hands and right foot amputated at Augusta Hospital, Georgia, and doctors thought she had only a slim chance of surviving the aggressive infection. She had been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in her throat, and her parents had learned to read lips to communicate with her. Miss Copeland has improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up for his brave daughter. She was able to ask for ice-cream, and let her family know when she was bored and wanted a book to read. Miss Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from the zip line over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound. Doctors at the local emergency room in Carrollton closed the wound with nearly two dozen staples, but it became infected within days. On May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital. In silence: Miss Copeland had been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in her throat, and her parents had learned to read lips to communicate with her . Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father has said the progress she has made after contracting the aggressive virus was a 'miracle' The flesh-eating bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, emit toxins that cut off blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat and skin tissue. Only a fortnight ago, doctors gave her little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite several major operations. Now she has spoken for the first time, although she is likely to remain in hospital for several months. 'This doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely amazed. A week ago, Mr Copeland revealed that his daughter was breathing on her own, as she was taken off her ventilator for several hours. She surprised doctors by sitting for five hours on Tuesday, after nurses thought she would only be able to sit up for an hour. Aimee 'is breathing completely on her own! How cool is that?' he wrote on his blog. Miss Copeland's amazing recovery has brought support from all over the world and her father had said how grateful he is for the outpouring of concern from across the world. 'The level of prayer and support has been phenomenal and we intend to read every card and send thank you cards for every gift,' he wrote after she began breathing independently. Stoic: Aimee Copeland has now been removed from a ventilator at the Georgia hospital after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria . 'Aimee is being Aimee. She's cracking jokes, speaking frankly, displaying her usual early morning grumpiness and she has been off of the ventilator for over 10 hours.' When Miss Copeland learned she would lose her hands and remaining foot on May 19, she responded by saying: 'Let's do this.' Mr Copeland wrote about the difficult talk he had a day earlier with his daughter after she contracted the condition. He said she 'shed no tears, she never batted an eyelash. I was crying because I am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady', Andy Copeland wrote. He said he was finally able to tell his daughter after she began communicating what had happened since that outing, and how she's been the focus of an outpouring of love from around the world. 'We told her that the world loved and admired her,' he wrote. 'We explained that she had become a symbol of hope, love and faith.' Difficult times: Miss Copeland was only given a small chance of survival as she battled the infection . Distraught: Paige Copeland, centre, cried as her parents Donna and Andy spoke about Aimee after she had her leg amputated . He recalled how Aimee's eyes widened and her jaw dropped. Then, Mr Copeland took his daughter's hands and held them up to her face. 'She didn't draw back in horror. She knew the condition she was in,' he wrote. He explained that doctors believed her hands were hampering her progress, and they must be removed. Aimee nodded, her father said. 'She smiled and raised her hands up, carefully examining them,' her father wrote. 'She then looked at us. We all understood her next three words - ""Let's do this"".' Doctors had hoped they would be able to save her remaining foot after two days of treatment using a hyperbaric chamber, in which patients breathe pure oxygen to boost white blood cells and accelerate healing. Cherished: Miss Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate from Georgia, has fun with friends . He said the family also wanted to make sure a hospital counsellor was available to help Miss Copeland once she was informed of her condition. Losing a limb is extremely difficult emotionally, and can be particularly difficult for young people, said Dr Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. 'There is a process that they go through, a grief process,' said Dr Kaslow, who is not involved in Miss Copeland's care. 'There is shock, disbelief, anger, sadness and then a period of reconciling one to the situation and healing and figuring out how they are going to move forward in their life.' Miss Copeland's father said she faces a long recovery not just from her amputation but also from kidney failure and other organ damage caused by the infection. 'She's going to be here for months,' he said. 'She's going to need to regrow skin that was removed. She's going to need to learn to use prosthetics. She's going to still be on dialysis for a while.' Fun loving: Aimee's father, Andy, says describes her as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people' Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Aimee Copeland has spoken for the first time since being infected after cutting her leg in a zip line accident .

A lucky soldier has been named the ‘bullet magnet’ after being shot twice by the Taliban in the space of two weeks - and surviving both attacks uninjured. Daniel Leonard, 21, had his rifle butt broken by enemy fire before another bullet went into body armour protecting his back just days later. The young soldier, from Sunderland, didn’t even realise he had been shot the second time – and thought he had merely been given a prod by his commanding officer to 'get down'. Targeted: Daniel Leonard was shot twice by the Taliban in the space of two weeks - and survived both attacks uninjured . The jolt from behind was in fact a high-velocity bullet which could have killed him. It was only when he got back to base he discovered that he had been hit and his Osprey body armour had been shattered. The young serviceman, from C Company, 3rd Battalion, The Rifles, has only been in Afghanistan since April. His best friend Sheldon Steel, 21, was killed in a Taliban bomb blast last November. Daniel, 21, told the Daily Star Sunday: ‘I've been unlucky to be hit twice but very lucky to have survived. ‘I have only been here two months and I've already been hit in the butt and the back by the Taliban!’ He said when he was struck in the back for a second time he was stunned – because he could easily have been killed. 'Bullet magnet': Daniel Leonard, 21, holds his gun which was damaged by the Taliban, left, and he can be seen wearing his Osprey body armour, right, which was damaged when he was hit for the second time . He added: ‘When I saw the size of the bullet that hit me and how it had smashed the plate, I realised I had been lucky. If it wasn't for my armour I'd have been a goner.’ The soldier was covering Army engineers as they built a bridge in Nad-e Ali North, near Kandahar in the south of the country, when he came under fire as he took cover in the corner of a compound. Two weeks beforehand the butt of his rifle was blasted off as he ran for cover after coming under fire. He is currently on a six-month tour of duty in the country. Daniel said that his mother, father and model girlfriend Emma Crowther, 17, had been stunned to learn that he had been shot twice. His army comrades have taken to calling him 'the bullet magnet' after the incidents.

A hilarious video of a bear taking a dip in a family swimming pool has been making waves across the world. The YouTube clip, which has attracted more than 17,000 views, shows the animal splashing about after climbing into the backyard of the Gasparinis' home in Monrovia, California. Shocked teenage sisters Valerie and Rachel could not believe their eyes when they saw the animal lower itself into the water outside their house. Scroll down for video . Bear-ing all: Valerie and Rachel Gasparini could not believe their eyes when they saw the animal climb in to their swimming pool . Grizzly sight: The girls filmed the splashing bear on a camera phone - and 'Larry' has now found fame across the world . The siblings, who were at their luxurious home alone, decided to film the bear idly paddling in the water as they watched in amazement. They recorded the remarkable episode from the safety of their kitchen, filming the action through a window on a camera phone. The girls can be heard laughing in surprise, saying, 'This is crazy!' and 'It's pretty good at swimming!' Both entranced and frightened by the sight, the pair compare the trespassing creature to a person, giggling at how it appears to be admiring the beautiful view as it enjoys a relaxing cool-down in the circular pool. The bear - who the Gasparini sisters dubbed 'Larry' - has found instant fame, and the video has appeared on ABC, CBS, KTLA, and Good Morning America. Animal kingdom: The laughing teenagers compared the creature to a human as it swam around and appeared to admire the view . 'It kind of like walks over to the pool, and we thought it was gonna . drink some water,' said Rachel afterwards, according to KTLA. 'It ends up jumping over the ledge, and it's kind of like floating around there, chilling.' The bear appears to be sitting on the built-in underwater stools during its five-minute visit. After paddling through the water for a short time, it wandered off back into the wild, without causing any damage. But the brave siblings were not too worried by the sight of the potentially dangerous beast. Valerie said: 'It wasn't any making a ruckus or it wasn't like destroying things in our backyard, so we didn't really feel the need to call anybody.' Rachel added: 'Yeah, it was more of entertainment than a scare.' Just as well, because the sisters were expecting a visitor at any moment - and he could have faced a closer encounter.","Shocked teenage filmmakers nicknamed the paddling bear 'Larry'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:20 EST, 24 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:55 EST, 25 April 2012 . Lawyers portrayed Thomas Kinkade's girlfriend as a ruthless gold digger who is out to 'tear down' the late artist's reputation and do irreparable damage to his family, in a restraining order granted by a judge today. The order against Amy Pinto-Walsh claimed she broke a confidentiality agreement by talking to reporters the morning Mr Kinkade was found dead and threatened to reveal his business and personal secrets. The artist's bodyguard - who drove him around after he was caught drink driving - said the family had reason to fear Pinto-Walsh because she was prone to 'impulsive and erratic' behavior and once threatened to 'tear Mr Kinkade down'. Battle: The 'painter of light' Thomas Kinkade, one of America's most popular artist, died at the age of 54 after struggling with alcoholism, a family member said . Family: The artist's wife Nanette, pictured right with their four daughters, said her husband provided his family with a 'wonderful life' His bodyguard Dean Baker was quited in court documents and said he was witness to her behavior when he accompanied them on numerous vacations. 'On one occasion Pinto-Walsh made a threat to Mr Kinkade along the . lines of ""I will tear you down. I would expect Pinto-Walsh to disclose confidential . information,' Mr Baker said in his declaration filed on . April 8. A close friend of the family and godmother to the Kinkade children Linda Raasch left a similar declaration saying she was concerned about Pinto-Walsh's motives, according to the Mercury News. She said: 'I told her releasing private and confidential documents would cause great emotional distress. But she was unmoved by my entreaties.' Mistress Amy Pinto-Walsh hoped to marry the painter . However the artist's brother Patrick said Pinto-Walsh was a 'good and sweet person' and was surprised at the restraining order. He told the Mercury News: 'Amy was Thom's girlfriend. They enjoyed each other immensely. She's a good . person, a sweet person. She cared about Thom.' The request for the restraining order said: 'This . threat is not just a mean-spirited act of betrayal, but a calculated . attempt to garner money and fame at the expense of the grieving Kinkade . family, including his wife and four daughters.' Though the painter had separated from his wife . about two years ago, their divorce was not finalized when he died three weeks ago of what is believed to have been natural causes. Mr Kinkade was said to have been planning on . marrying Ms Pinto-Walsh as soon as the divorce was finalized. They had . been dating for 18 months. 'Amy was already part of his circle of friends and that really enraged Nanette,' an unnamed source told Radar Online. 'Nanette was furious and humiliated that he not only cheated on her, but moved on so quickly and publicly with her.' She didn't make any attempt to hide . her frustration either, as she filed a restraining order against his . mistress shortly after his death, wanting to stop her from breaching a confidentiality agreement she signed more than a year ago. Nanette fears Amy Pinto-Walsh will attempt to sell her story and could release private family photographs. Kinkade was one of the most . successful artists in the U.S., but he struggled with alcoholism before . his death at the age of 54, and split from his wife Nanette in 2010. The so-called 'Painter of Light' used to estimate that around one out of every 20 homes in America. His estate - of which Mrs Kinkade is . the principal trustee - has filed documents with a Santa Clara court . seeking an injunction against Ms Pinto-Walsh, according to Los Gatos . Patch. Struggle: The devout Christian had battled through a divorce and bankruptcy in recent years while also facing needling critics, his brother said . Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes . Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right) Its attorneys argue that the . painter's mistress, who is still living in his mansion in Monte Sereno, . California, is planning to disclose information which would breach a . confidentiality agreement signed in February 2011. The restraining order would ban Ms . Pinto-Walsh from saying or doing anything which would make Kinkade, his . wife or his business 'appear in a negative light or false light'. She would also be prevented from . writing or contributing to any sort of book, article or other . publication about the late artist. In particular, the lawsuit seeks to . stop her divulging personal information which she found out 'as a . personal assistant and companion to Thomas Kinkade'. Three days after his death, Ms Pinto-Walsh told the paper: 'He died in his sleep, very happy, in . the house he built, with the paintings he loved and the woman he loved.' It was the . same day Windermere filed an initial request for a restraining order . against her. The documents also dispute the date of Kinkade's death, . stating that Kinkade died the night of April 5, not the next morning. The coroner is still investigating the cause of death. In the confidentiality agreement Ms . Pinto-Walsh signed in February 2011, she was said to be privy to 'trade secrets,' including Mr Kinkade's painting techniques and 'use of computer technology . in painting'. Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives . While it is not clear what exactly . prompted the legal battle, the suit alleges that Ms Pinto-Walsh told a . family friend that she intended to sell the story of her relationship . with Kinkade and release unseen photographs of the painter. The suit continues: 'The release of . these items would be personally devastating not only for Mrs Kinkade, . but also for the family's four daughters, who are grieving the sudden . loss of their father.' The family also fears that Ms . Pinto-Walsh could jeopardise Kinkade's business empire, which relied on . the production of prints and reproductions as much as original . paintings. They say she had access to 'trade . secrets' such as the artist's painting techniques and computer . programmes, and could try to sell them on to others. Ms Pinto-Walsh, who had been in a . relationship with Kinkade for 18 months before his death, told Los Gatos . Patch at the time that the painter 'had a heart condition'. Mrs Kinkade's lawsuit cites this . revelation of a 'non-public health condition' as one breach of Ms . Pinto-Walsh's confidentiality agreement. The suit also says that Kinkade died . on the night of April 5, which contradicts previous reports that he was . found dead the next morning. While the artist was phenomenally . successful and extremely wealthy, he apparently suffered from a drinking . problem throughout much of his life, and in June 2010 was arrested for . drink-driving. He was also saddened by constant attacks on the quality of his work by art critics, and devastated by his divorce from Nanette.","Painter split from wife Nanette in 2010 and moved in with Amy Pinto-Walsh .

The Queen today wore a traditional floral dress to launch a very modern resource - a website made up of the journals of her great-great-grandmother Victoria. Dressed in a high-necked turquoise and purple frock and pearls, the monarch used a remote control to reveal the site on a screen in Buckingham Palace’s throne room. More than 40,000 pages of the diaries kept by Queen Victoria from the age of 13 until just before her death have been published. Royal writings: The Queen launches an online collection of the private journals of Victoria today, accompanied by curator of the Royal Collection, Lady Jane Roberts, at Buckingham Palace . You're not seeing my diary! The monarch meets Bodleian Librarian Sarah Thomas during a reception to launch the Queen Victoria Journals Online . But the Queen provoked laughter when she commented, 'Mine's not being published.' The Royal Archives, Bodleian Libraries at Oxford University and online publisher ProQuest scanned the pages - some in Victoria’s own hand and some edited and transcribed by her daughter Beatrice after her death - for the six-month project marking the Diamond Jubilee. Queen Victoria wrote of the scenes that greeted her during a parade to mark her own 60-year reign: 'Passed through dense crowds, who gave me a most enthusiastic reception. It was like a triumphal entry. We passed down Cambridge Terrace, under a lovely arch bearing the motto, ‘Our hearts thy Throne’. 'The streets were beautifully decorated, also the balconies of the houses with flowers, flags, and draperies of every hue... The streets, the windows, the roofs of the houses, were one mass of beaming faces, and the cheers never ceased.' New age: The Queen wore a floral dress and black courts to the event digitalising the diaries of Queen Victoria . The Queen paid tribute to her forebear on the website, writing: 'In this the year of my Diamond Jubilee, I am delighted to be able to present, for the first time, the complete online collection of Queen Victoria’s journals from the Royal Archives. 'These diaries cover the period from Queen Victoria’s childhood days to her accession to the throne, marriage to Prince Albert, and later, her Golden and Diamond Jubilees. 'It seems fitting that the subject of the first major public release of material from the Royal Archives is Queen Victoria, who was the first Monarch to celebrate a Diamond Jubilee.' Interestingly, Victoria wrote on her Diamond Jubilee about sending a message electronically. 'I touched an electric button, by which I started a message which was telegraphed throughout the whole Empire,' she wrote. 'It was the following: ""From my heart I thank my beloved people, may God bless them.""' The Twitter account @QueenVictoriaRI will be active during the Jubilee period. The online release of the diaries, which have been transcribed up to the year 1840, mark the start of a year-long programme to digitise work from the Royal Archive. The Queen was forced to rebuff Bodleian librarian Sarah Thomas when asked if she herself wrote a diary. Dr Thomas said it had been 'an amazing honour' to work on the journals, which include sketches and paintings drawn by Victoria to illustrate the books. She said: 'We have been motivated by the intrinsic value of these collections and the idea of sharing them. 'It amplifies the excitement we have in having Her Majesty herself come here, because it shows she has a real interest. She was obviously engaged. 'This is a part of history. It is such an exciting moment, when you can unlock history and make it publicly available. 'The eyes of the world are focused on the Queen and the Diamond Jubilee - and this is the other Diamond Jubilee.'","Online resource made up of 40,000 pages written by the monarch .

A former police officer has been arrested for starting a sexual relationship with an eight-year-old girl he was raising and fathering three children with her. George Gibson, from Newark, Ohio, allegedly knew the youngster because he had been dating her mother. But she abandoned her child when the youngster was just eight years old and left her for Gibson to raise.

Nearly £5billion was wiped off the value of Tesco yesterday after the firm revealed a fall in Christmas sales. Britain’s biggest and richest retailer said underlying takings fell by 2.3 per cent at the most crucial trading period of the year. Tesco’s flagship promotion the ‘Big Price Drop’ failed to bring in enough shoppers, while bosses admitted that a decision to cut back on vouchers and meal deals was wrong. As a result, the supermarket’s Christmas food sales were disappointing. The news came with a profit warning – the first in living memory – that the retail juggernaut will not see a previously expected 10 per cent increase in earnings. Failing to pull in the punters: Consumers were not enticed by the supermarket's offers . Slump: The Tesco share price has had 50p wiped from it after the sales figures were announced . The poor festive trading meant Tesco’s share of the Christmas grocery market has dipped below 30 per cent for the first time in six years. It is an embarrassing reverse for a company that has seen decades of growth, becoming the UK’s biggest private sector employer and capturing around £1 in every £3 spent on groceries. The news sent a shudder through the City where analysts described the figures in grim terms, ranging from ‘deeply underwhelming’ to a ‘nightmare scenario’. As a result, shares plummeted by 15.9 per cent, which is the firm’s biggest one day fall since 1988 and reduced its market value by just short of £5billion.  Tesco was among a number of household name chains to reveal miserable Christmas sales yesterday, including Argos, Halfords, Mothercare and Thorntons. Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke admitted it had wrongly pulled back on one-off promotions, such as meal deals and ‘buy one get one free’ offers, as its rivals increased them. The marketing push by competitors helped Sainsbury’s to deliver a 2.1 per cent increase in underlying sales at Christmas, while Morrisons was up by 0.7 per cent. Mr Clarke said: ‘I’ve got to acknowledge that we backed off on some of our promotion and coupon activity just as everyone upped it. ‘I’m disappointed over Christmas trading in the UK but the promotional impact was so great – we didn’t offer a barrage of coupons and we need to reflect on that.’ Mr Clarke, who took over as Tesco boss from Sir Terry Leahy last year, denied that he had been handed a poisoned chalice, saying: ‘There isn’t a retailer in the UK who inherited a business with so many opportunities to grow around the world.’ Cautious consumers: Despite huge promotions a number of business have seen sales plummet as shoppers hold on to their money . The supermarket raised prices for a few days and were then able to say customers were making big savings. Many of the items that were reduced were either sold for the same amount they were six weeks before the promotion or have only been cut by a small amount. Some Tesco prices that did not drop were: . Tesco Value Unsalted Butter - August 23: £1.10; August 30: £1.19; September 26: £1.10 . Tesco Value Unsmoked Back Bacon - August 16: £1.44; August 23: £1.57; September 26: £1.44; . Oxo Beef Stock Cubes - 12 pack - August 16: 99p; August 27: £1.07; September 26: 99p; . Loose Carrots - August/September: 70p per kg; One week at 80p; September 26: 56p; . SOURCE: THE TIMES . Tesco had pinned its hopes of growth on its ‘Big Price Drop’, which was presented as rescuing customers from the biggest cost of living squeeze in living memory. Prices would be cut on 3,000 commonly bought items, saving shoppers £500million over a full year. But customers, who have continued to see an increase in the cost of the weekly shop, have not been convinced. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said the trading update was ‘something of a profits warning for the year’. Retail analyst Philip Dorgan, of Panmure Gordon, said: ‘This is the nightmare scenario. If [Tesco’s] UK profits keep falling, then it will not be able to invest so much overseas, so long-term growth will slow and returns will significantly undershoot targets.’ But Tarlok Teji, retail analyst at Manchester Business School, said it would be wrong to believe Tesco will not bounce back. In a significant change in policy, Tesco said it plans to open fewer hypermarkets in the UK and to devote more cash to expanding its online business and small outlets.Tesco’s fall of 2.3 per cent in sales covered the six weeks to January 7. The weak performance was driven by food sales rather than general merchandise, clothing and electricals, which saw growth overall. Online sales grew more than 14 per cent. At the same time, total international sales rose by 8.2 per cent, despite problems in the U.S. where it is to close 12 of its Fresh’n’Easy outlets. To the chagrin of its boss Phil Clarke, Tesco’s Big Price Drop did not happen in the supermarket, but on the stock market. Tesco . has been the uncontested champion of food retailing in Britain for . almost two decades. Its tills continued to ring, and its profits . continued to flow, throughout the financial crisis and the recession. So . City traders were simply dumbfounded when the company confessed to a . downturn in UK sales over the vital Christmas period and warned that . profit growth is slowing. It’s . safe to say that having getting on for £5billion wiped off the value of . the company was not the kind of discounting Phil Clarke had in mind . when he launched a promotion aimed at austerity Britain last autumn. Not so sweet Christmas: Thorntons the chocolatier also had disappointing sales during the festive season . But his Big Price Drop campaign, which cut the cost of everyday goods across the board, was outgunned by more sophisticated marketing moves by rivals such as Sainsbury and Morrisons.Tesco was left in the unfamiliar position of trailing its competitors. The share price fall may have felt cataclysmic, but the company is hardly on its knees. Around £1 in every £3 spent on groceries in Britain goes into one of its tills and it’s also the UK’s biggest non-food retailer, thanks to its sales of clothing, books, toys, electrical items and home products. International expansion means a large chunk of Tesco sales is now made overseas, in locations including Hungary and Thailand. So a 2.3 per cent fall in underlying sales in just one part of the empire, the bricks-and-mortar stores in Britain, doesn’t sound like a catastrophic failure. But the British supermarkets are still the group’s beating heart – and until recently, this kind of lapse by Tesco would have been unthinkable. Under the 15-year stewardship of Sir Terry Leahy, who stepped down in March last year, Tesco was a relentless profit-making machine that appeared incapable of slipping into reverse gear. Only time will tell whether Phil Clarke (left) can put Tesco back on top – or whether Sir Terry Leahy (right) should have gone . shopping somewhere else for his successor . Before he hung up his grocer’s apron, Leahy had more than tripled Tesco’s operating profits to £3.5billion, by moving the business light years away from the ‘pile ’em high, sell ’em cheap’ philosophy of Tesco’s market-trader founder, Sir Jack Cohen. In the process, he not only transformed . Tesco, but the entire supermarket sector. In place of the depressing, fluorescent strip-lit aisles of yesteryear, he introduced sleek . out-of-town superstores and small convenience outlets in urban centres. With its Clubcard, Tesco was a . pioneer of loyalty points and its ‘Finest’ range of upmarket food lured . gourmet shoppers who in the past had spurned its shelves. The . obvious question, then, is whether Tesco’s fall from grace is Phil . Clarke’s fault – or whether his apparently golden inheritance was . flawed. Critics in the . City have fretted for some time that the group’s ambitious foreign . growth plans – led by Clarke before he took over as group chief . executive in March – could lead to under-investment in the core UK . business. Clarke is now committed to investing more in the British . stores. Others doubted . that the new man could ever hope to emulate Leahy, who by the time of . his retirement had become a legend in retail circles. Leahy himself . handpicked Clarke to succeed him. Weak christmas sales at Tesco were caused by dropping food sales . Both are down-to-earth Liverpudlians who worked their way up to the boardroom from the shop floor. They even live on the same street in a Hertfordshire village near Cheshunt, where Tesco has its HQ. Those who have accused Tesco of destroying high streets with its suburban superstores and of driving independent village shops into extinction will no doubt rejoice at the thought its empire-building days may be coming to an end. No business, however great its record, has a divine right to success. Virtually all companies in the end fall foul of smarter competition, or their own complacency. Only time will tell whether Phil Clarke can put Tesco back on top – or whether Sir Terry Leahy should have gone shopping somewhere else for his successor.","Tesco shares slumped by 15% after it announced sales figures .

Spain's King and Queen will not be celebrating their Golden Wedding anniversary in any fashion, the country's royal court has confirmed. King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia's announcement that they will hold neither a public nor private party on May 14 has fuelled speculation they are actually 'estranged'. In recent months they have rarely been seen out in public, and rumours have abounded of the King's 'roving eye' - with some suggesting he has bedded more than 1,500 women. Shunning: Spain's King and Queen will not be celebrating their Golden Wedding anniversary in any fashion, the country's royal court has confirmed . Tour: King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia in the cockpit of an Airbus A380 during a visit to the Airbus factory in Blagnac, near Toulouse, France . But others claim the move is designed to appease Spaniards still angry with their monarch for going on a lavish £27,000 elephant hunting safari in Botswana last month. The extravagant trip, which only came to light when the 74-year-old returned to Spain after breaking his hip, came as the number of jobless in the country soared to almost one in four. His sheepish and unprecedented act of royal contrition, said as he stood outside the Madrid hospital where he was operated, went some way to healing his relationship with the public. A lack of a party, observers say, will again show the King is in some way getting back in touch with his subjects and willing to undergo the same austerity. Under fire: Spanish King Juan Carlos (right), pictured during a previous elephant hunting trip in Africa, has come in for criticism for his safari . The decision is in stark contrast to . their 1987 silver wedding anniversary, when couples from all over Spain . who wed on the same 1962 day attended a party at the Zarzuela palace. And it comes during a tricky time for the King, who is facing his first bout of criticism from the Spanish press. Nuptials: The King and Queen of Spain on their wedding day in Greece in 1962 .

The . rumours of his alleged infidelities are also increasing, even in the . Spanish press, with claims surfacing in several books that he is a . real-life Don Juan. Just three months ago an explosive . book, by Barcelona-based author Pilar Eyre, claimed he was a 'serial . womaniser' who had bedded more than 1,500 women. The . Solitude of the Queen labelled him a 'professional seducer' who once . tried to seduce Princess Diana and who has had numerous affairs. It . said that he has not shared a bed with his wife Queen Sofia for the . past 35 years and claimed she stumbled upon her husband with one of his . alleged  lovers, the Spanish film star Sara Montiel, at a friend’s . country house in Toledo in 1976. Following the ill-fated hunting trip, reports also said Queen Sofia only visited him at his bedside for 26 minutes. It . prompted royal commentator and former director of ABC newspaper, Jose . Antonio Zarzalejos, to say: 'The failure of his marriage to Queen Sofia, . from whom he is practically separated, is public knowledge.' There are also claims he has been in a .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . PUBLISHED: . 11:54 EST, 2 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:25 EST, 3 April 2012 . Being called upon to design for the Queen is likely to be the highlight of  any fashion designer's career. But it could also herald the most daunting, indeed, terrifying moment in a couturier's life. As revealed in a new book, Elizabeth: Reigning in Style by Jane Eastoe, reprised in this weekend’s Stella magazine, to be asked to supply sketches to the Queen was a daunting prospect. Dressing the Queen: Hardy Amies, who designed the blue creation worn by the Queen here, said he was frequently disappointed to see his 'beautiful designs' ruined by what he called the Queen's 'ugly handbags' Couturiers, milliners and other designers would be contacted by the Queen’s dressers and asked to provide sketches. Frequently, they would receive no further detail – no hint as to the nature of the event, or even the time of year the outfit would be required for – making it very difficult to supply something precisely to her requirements. Those who did pass muster would then have to attend a fitting with the Queen – a prospect that was in itself widely felt to be terrifying. Daunting: Milliner Frederick Fox says his first fitting with the Queen was one of the most terrifying moments of his life . Jane Eastoe explains that upon his royal appointment in the late 1960s, the milliner Frederick Fox was briefed ahead of his fitting with the Queen by one of her most trusted designers, Hardy Amies. He told Fox: ‘Don’t touch the Queen, don’t ask questions and don’t turn your back’. Eastoe tells how, on the day in . question, Australian-born Fox came into difficulties with the edict that . he mustn’t turn his back. ‘The . Queen was standing at the end of a long room,’ she reports him as . saying. 'I advanced, did my chat and my thing. When it was time to . depart I was rooted to the spot. I thought that if I walked backwards I . would fall over the furniture of one of the corgis. 'Her Majesty spotted my dilemma and turned her back on me to ask Bobo [the Queen’s dresser] to fetch some specific shoes  - giving me the opportunity to withdraw.' Royal favourite: Princess Diana in a Frederick Fox hat . Fox designed five hats for the Queen's tour of Chile and Argentina, and went on to design for the Queen on numerous occasions. He was awarded a royal warrant in 1974, as well as an LVO in the Queen's 1999 birthday honours list, making the hard work and trauma worthwhile. He has also designed headpieces for eight further royals, including the Queen Mother and Diana, Princess of Wales. Trusted: Sir Hardy Amies designed for the Queen from the 50s until 2002, a year before his death - and advised Frederick Fox on his royal fitting . For Amies’ part, despite his privileged position as one of the Queen’s favourite couturiers – he designed gowns for the Queen from the early part of the 50s right up to a year before his death, in 2003 – it was not always a bed of roses for a designer with a ferociously specific design aesthetic. Eastoe tells how Hardy Amies, along with the Queen’s other couturiers, despaired of Her Majesty’s tendency to pair their outfits with what they deemed to her ‘ugly’ handbags that blighted their designs. She says that the Queen’s formidable dresser Bobo wanted to ensure no design house dominated the Queen’s wardrobe, so she would outsource the design of hats, shoes and handbags to other designers which would then be matched to her outfits. Hardy Amies, she says, ‘complained bitterly’ about ‘ugly handbags’ that ruined his ‘beautiful designs’. His solution, which he claims was a popular strategy among Her Majesty’s dress designers, was to give the Queen handbags they considered to be beautiful in the hopes she would choose to carry those instead.

Britain would lose the Falklands if Argentina decided to invade according to one of the most distinguished commanders of the 1982 conflict. Major General Julian Thompson, who commanded the brigade of Royal Marines during the conflict, said the islands have been left vulnerable by defence cuts, and it would be 'end of story' if Argentine forces took the British base on East Falkland. He explained it has been left vulnerable because cost-cutting meant the Royal Navy did not have an aircraft carrier to defend the region. He told The Times: 'The Argentines have a marine brigade. They've got a parachute brigade and some good special forces.' 'All they've got to do is get those guys . on to the islands for long enough to destroy the (RAF) Typhoon jets and . that's the end of it. Uncertain: General Thompson said Britain's hold on the islands had been left vulnerable because cost-cutting meant the Royal Navy did not have an aircraft carrier to defend the region . Vulnerable: Gen Thompson said if the airfield was destroyed, the only option for Britain to protect the region would be to send reinforcements by sea, as Margaret Thatcher did in the 1980s . If the airfield was destroyed, the only option for Britain to protect the region would be to send reinforcements by sea, as Margaret Thatcher did in the 1980s. She sent across HMS Invincible and HMS Hermes which were successful at keeping the enemy aircraft at bay, but now any task force would lack a carrier and jets. General Thompson added: 'You have got to take your own air support with you and you can't without a carrier. End of story.' In 1982, the Falklands Task Force had two aircraft carriers, but Britain's troubled and increasingly expensive plan to equip the navy with new aircraft carriers has been a well-documented struggle after ministers remain unsure about what jets will be able to launch from them. The decision to scrap the Harrier fleet plan means that Britain will have no carrier aircraft capability between 2011 and 2020. The next aircraft carrier, the Queen Elizabeth will not be operational for another eight years. This has worrying implications for Britain's capability as tensions between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen. It started to intensify since 2010, when oil exploration by British . companies off the islands raised the stakes. General Thompson said he thought President Cristina Fernandez de . Kirchner, left, was trying to force David Cameron into discussing the islands sovereignty . General Thompson said he believed President Cristina Fernandez de . Kirchner was doing everything she could to force Mr Cameron into discussing the islands sovereignty, although the PM has refused to start with Argentina unless the 3,000 islanders want them. Last month Downing Street accused . Argentina of pursuing a 'policy of confrontation' over the islands, . after reports suggested Argentina's industry minister called for all British imports to be banned. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office summoned an Argentinian envoy to London last week to explain the proposed ban as well as what happened when the South American state's government prevented two cruise ships from docking following a visit to the Falkland Islands last month. Diplomatic tension: Relations between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen . Britain recently deployed one of its . most modern destroyers, HMS Dauntless, to the region, and although it . insisted the move was merely routine, Argentina met with UN .

Britain's most celebrated war ship, HMS Victory, is being hired out for parties and dinners costing £1,500 per person. The Great Cabin, where Admiral Lord Nelson plotted his strategy during the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, is available for fine dining by a group of 20 people for a minimum cost of £30,000. The use of the vessel – which led Britain to victory against the French and Spanish fleets – will dismay traditionalists who believe treasured parts of the nation’s heritage should not be exploited for commercial benefit. For hire: Britain's most celebrated war ship is being touted out for dinner parties at £1,500 per head to help fund repairs. It is docked in Portsmouth . However, the dilemma of how to fund heritage projects – when government money is no longer available – has forced the National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN), which now has responsibility for the ship’s upkeep, to find finance by other means. Anna Tribe, 82, the great-great-great granddaughter of Admiral Lord Nelson, said: ‘I suppose they are terribly short of money. If it is absolutely necessary, and they are very selective about who uses it, then I suppose it will have to be.’ Shot: Lord Nelson was shot aboard the HMS Victory - now the room where he plotted his strategy during the Battle of Trafalgar is being touted out . Jeanette Ryder, from The Nelson Society, said: ‘A lot of money is needed for renovation so, if it’s not for hen nights or that sort of thing, it will help preserve the ship.’ The Royal Navy handed over the ship, based at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, Hampshire, to the NMRN last month as part of Ministry of Defence cuts to help plug a £38 billion deficit. But the MoD agreed a £25 million . capital grant to help the NMRN look after the ship – which is undergoing . a £16 million restoration project including the replacement of rigging . and timber. The NMRN, which has to raise . £2 million a year for the ship’s upkeep, is now promoting Victory as a . ‘privileged’ party venue. It has taken out full-page advertisements in . ‘select’ publications including The Oldie and the Royal Opera House . corporate magazine. The NMRN says the ship usually hosts a corporate event every week, but would not reveal which companies had booked it. On hiring the ship, a client is . allocated a liaison officer from the NMRN who helps them create a menu . and wine and champagne list to suit their individual needs. A seat at the table in Nelson’s Great . Cabin starts at £1,500 and the room can accommodate 20 people – meaning a . typical party costs at least £30,000.

Good news: A doctor has found the cure for a mysterious and debilitating condition which afflicted people in a rural part of Sweden with the need to urinate up to 15 litres a day . A doctor has found the cure for a mysterious and debilitating condition which afflicted people in a rural part of Sweden with the need to urinate up to 15 litres a day. Since the early 1800s, many in Värmland, near the Norwegian border, have been struck down by the disease as they reached their teens. It was only when Dr Johan Jendle, a Swedish doctor at Karlstad Hospital, spotted that all sufferers were related, that he identified the cause as a hitherto unknown genetic variant of Diabetes Insipidus. 'Normal people urinate 1.5 litres per day', Dr Jendle told Nya Wermlands-Tidningen, a local paper. 'But those who suffer from Diabetes Insipidus can urinate 15 litres per day, which needing to drink a corresponding amount.' 'Sufferers often find that they have to be within sight of a toilet, and need easy access to water constantly', he added. Jendle tracked down all living members of the family, now scattered throughout Sweden, and managed to trace the disease back to a genetic mutation that happened some time in the 1800s. 'About half of all children in the family have suffered to a greater or lesser extent', he said. 'Now we can use a simple blood test to find out if a person carrying the disease,  and then treat it when the symptoms occur.' Cure: It was only when a Swedish doctor at Karlstad Hospital, pictured, spotted that all sufferers were related, that he identified the cause . The condition is not usually thought of as genetic, and is usually caused by damage to the pituitary gland, either as the result of a tumour, or of a violent assault. The pituitary gland, among other things, produces the urinary hormone, vasopressin. The condition, which can be lethal in extreme cases, can be treated with hormone supplements. Dr Jendle has published his findings in the American Journal of Clinical Endocrinology.","Debilitating condition had been causing suffers to urinate up to 15 litres in a day .

"PUBLISHED: . 10:14 EST, 29 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:29 EST, 29 May 2012 . A solicitor has launched a High Court libel action against a property millionaire client who accused him of charging £4,050 for a day’s legal work whilst he was actually playing golf. Businessman Colin Sullivan, 69, claims his former lawyer Stewart Brian Wiseman spent a ‘whole day’ playing golf at the prestigious Dyrham Park Country Club in Hertfordshire, instead of handling a case for him in November 2009. The High Court heard that Mr Sullivan became enraged when he received a bill charging him for 13 and a half hours toil at £300 an hour for that day. Action: Solicitor Stewart Wiseman, left, has launched a libel case against Colin Sullivan, right, after he allegedly parked his car outside the lawyer's office with flyers saying he charged £300-an-hour while playing golf . The wealthy developer ‘plastered’ his Range Rover with ‘offensive notices’ and first parked it outside the lawyer’s home in Clerkenwell, then outside his offices in Duke Street, Central London, the High Court was told. The notices - one of which read, ‘Stewart Wiseman took a full day off to play golf plus a half day for personal reasons yet charged me for 13 and a half hour days’ - were photographed by a passerby and ended up being posted on an internet discussion board. Mr Sullivan, of Brentwood, in Essex, also claims his former lawyer submitted a bill for his full hourly rate for two ‘friendly’ dinners the pair enjoyed at his expense. The case throws a spotlight on the way lawyers calculate their fees at an hourly rate. Mr Wiseman flatly denies the allegations and is now suing Mr Sullivan for alleged defamation, asking Mr Justice Eady to grant him ‘significant’ damages on the basis that his professional reputation was tarnished by the ‘extremely serious allegation of fraud’ made by his former client. The court heard the disputed charge for the alleged ‘golf day’ was part of a £37,800 bill for Mr Wiseman handling High Court litigation involving three of Mr Sullivan’s companies, in October and November 2009. Accusations: Property millionaire Colin Sullivan accused solicitor Stuart Brian Wiseman of charging him for a day spent playing gold at Dyrham Park in Hertfordshire, which boasts this impressive clubhouse . Mark Tomassi, for Mr Sullivan, told the judge: ‘The important allegation is that he was charging for a full day’s, 13 and a half hours, work when he took the full day off and charged for it.’ The barrister, addressing Mr Wiseman in the witness box, put to him that evidence showed that he had also charged his client £600 for a two-hour meeting they had in a cafe and alleged that he had also put in a bill for his full hourly rate for two ‘friendly’ dinners out the pair had enjoyed at Mr Sullivan’s expense. ‘You would be wined and dined and subsequently you presented Mr Sullivan with a bill which charged him £300 for each hour you were dining...It cost him £600 for the pleasure of your company for two hours in a cafe,’ the barrister said. Mr Wiseman accepted he charged for the two-hour meeting in the cafe but denied presenting a bill for the evening dinners. Mr Tomassi told the judge that, for Mr Sullivan to defend successfully the defamation claim, ‘what needs to be justified is the allegation that he (Mr Wiseman) was charging for 13 and a half hour days when he was playing golf or away from the office for other purposes.’ Picturesque: Golfers flock to the Dyrham Park Country Club which is said to be one of the most outstanding courses in Hertfordshire. (File photo) Jacob Dean, for Mr Wiseman, told the court his client admits he is a member of the country club and played golf there during the time he was advising Mr Sullivan. However he maintains he only charged his client for two hours work on the crucial day, work which he did. ‘At the heart of this case is an allegation that my client charged Mr Sullivan for time he was on the golf course...If that allegation is not proved, the libel is proved,’ he told the judge. ‘He accepts he played golf on Novemeber 20, starting at 11am, and two hours were charged for that day. That is the amount of work that he did for that day,’ the barrister added. Mr Wiseman himself, in the witness box, said he had worked as a solicitor for 40 years and dismissed the allegations against him as ‘absolute nonsense.’ Insisting he had charged Mr Sullivan reasonably, he added: ‘I was full on from the moment I had instructions and dealt with a great deal of work.’ Asking for a substantial award of libel damages, Mr Dean said: ‘This libel clearly touches on the core attributes of Mr Wiseman’s professional reputation, accusing him of being a dishonest solicitor fraudulently charging for work which was not done.’ The High Court hearing, set to last four days, continues.","Property millionaire 'plastered' his Range Rover with 'offensive notices' and parked outside lawyer's home and office after receiving bill, court told .

Kerry Kennedy, the best friend and sister-in-law of Mary Kennedy, who committed suicide last week, has written about Mary's life-long battle with depression. The sister of Robert F Kennedy Jr said that she had known Mary for 37 years - and throughout that time she had struggled with mental illness. Mrs Kennedy, 52, was struggling with debt and depression before she was found dead at her home in Bedford, New York last week. Unbreakable bond: Kerry Kennedy (right) with her best friend and sister-in-law Mary Kennedy who committed suicide last week . She had been embroiled in a bitter divorce battle with her estranged husband who had taken to appearing at public events with their four children and his new girlfriend, 46-year-old actress Cheryl Hines. Documents showed she was facing a $32,000 lawsuit from American Express, though this was dropped following her death. Kerry Kennedy, who introduced Mary to her future husband, wrote in the New York Post: 'Mary didn’t ask for this disease, she never deserved it, and she took every step, from those prescribed by doctors to looking to God, to try and find a way out of it. 'Mary recognized part of her was broken. As her husband, my brother Bobby, who spent years and untold efforts trying to rescue her from her depression, said in his eulogy, Mary would be distressed to know so many of her friends feel they should have done more to save her.' She added that her sister-in-law would have wanted her death to inspire efforts to fight the battle against the disease. High profile: Cheryl Hines and Robert F Kennedy Jr at the Riverkeeper Annual Fishermen's Ball in New York last month . Kerry Kennedy, is the seventh of the 11 children of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. She went on to say that her sister-in-law endured 'unbearable pain' for the sake of her four children - Conor, 18, Kyra, 17, Finn, 15, and 11-year-old Aiden. In recent months, Kerry Kennedy had grown close to her brother's new partner - Curb  Your Enthusiasm star Cheryl Hines. A photo posted to Twitter by Kerry showed a grinning Glenn Close, another close friend of Mary's, side-by-side with Mr Kennedy and his girlfriend. Robert Kennedy Jr's girlfriend boasted about their relationship online in the weeks leading up to his estranged wife's suicide. Cheryl Hines posted Twitter messages that showed she had all but taken the place of Mary Richardson Kennedy. She had appeared on Mr Kennedy's arm at galas and events held by Riverkeeper, the environmental protection group of which he is vice chairman. Her tweets also suggested she had also become close with two of Mrs Kennedy's best friends, sister-in-law Kerry Kennedy and the actress Glenn Close. She even told her followers about how she had been talking about sport with the Kennedys' youngest son Aiden. A post from February 5 read: 'Rabid, unhinged New England zealotry by 10-yr-old Aidan Kennedy has nearly turned me into Pats fan.' These are the pictures which likely sent Mary over the edge  as it appeared Cheryl Hines was trying to hijack her life by growing close to her children, left, and even boasting about her friendship with Glenn Close, below . Moving on: A picture posted on Twitter of Mr Kennedy and Ms Hines at the birthday party of actress Glenn Close (left), a close friend of Mary Kennedy . Ms Hines deleted her Twitter account around the time of Mrs Kennedy's death - but by then the messages had already been archived by social media search engine Topsy. The actress proudly told the world about her new life with her boyfriend, the lawyer son of assassinated senator Robert F Kennedy. Mary Kennedy was said to have found it 'humiliating' when her husband and children appeared with Ms Hines at the Riverkeeper Annual Fisherman's Ball last month. The blonde sitcom star also went with Mr Kennedy, 58, to Glenn Close's birthday party on April 15. Mrs Close had been firm friends with Mrs Kennedy and even sang at her funeral on Saturday. Meeting the family: Cheryl Hines with Robert F Kennedy Jr and his mother Ethel, as well as former Vice President Al Gore (left) at an awards dinner in December . Public appearance: The couple with Kathleen, Mr Kennedy's daughter from his first marriage . On April 28, Kerry Kennedy posted a picture of Cheryl Hines and her brother eating with singer Jackson Browne after an education fundraiser, along with the message: 'Cheryl and Jackson were amazing on stage and off.' A spokeswoman for Ms Hines said the actress's 'thoughts and prayers are with the family'. Earlier this week tensions between Mr Kennedy and his late wife's relatives resulted in the Richardson family holding their own private memorial service after all but one of them stayed away from the funeral he arranged. The service in New York City followed a legal dispute in which Mrs Kennedy's brother Thomas Richardson, a lawyer, tried to stop her estranged husband claiming her body. But the judge ruled in Mr Kennedy's favour, also awarding him full custody of his children and the whole of their mother's $4million estate. After just one of the Richardson siblings attended the funeral on Saturday, other family members and friends arranged a 'celebration' of Mrs Kennedy's life at The Standard Hotel in Manhattan. At the 200-strong memorial, there was no talk of demons or sadness but only the 'light and love that Mary brought into a room'. Her widower was not invited, and took their four children to stay with their grandmother in Florida. At the funeral on Saturday, Robert delivered a tearful eulogy which seemed to distance himself from any blame in Mary's suicide, saying she had a 'sadness that kicked her and chased her'. He also said that his late wife suffered from depression long before her 1994 marriage and Kerry Kennedy said 'she struggled from the time I met her when she was 15'. But Mary's close friends dispute this. 'Battling demons? That's hyperbolic language,' Carole Radziwill told People magazine. 'I didn't see anything close to that. 'She truly believed in the goodness of people. In the end that was her undoing.' Another friend said: 'Mary did not have a history of depression. She became a troubled person because of the divorce.'

The court was told he was lonely and £60,000 in debt after a relationship came to an end. He used the force computer to access information about three women and stole nearly £4,000 which had been recovered in raids at suspected brothels and lap dancing clubs. James Hughes (above), 31, turned to crime after his relationship failed, leaving him owing £60,000. He used the force computer to access information about three women. Pictured outside Leeds Crown Court today . He was able to steal the money, which was stored in bags, as he was an exhibits officer. Today, prosecutor Richard Walters said Hughes was lonely, heavily in debt, spending money on women and 'trying to impress people'. He described how on 24 occasions, Hughes accessed information about a leisure club receptionist whose details were on the police computer system after her flatmate was arrested. He also accessed the details of a woman whose handbag had been stolen, looking at her details three times in three minutes on one occasion. Hughes stole nearly £4,000 which had been recovered in raids at suspected brothels and lap dancing clubs (posed by model) A third woman had her computer details accessed on seven occasions, the court was told. Hughes did not use the information for commercial gain or profit and initially he had accessed the details for legitimate police purposes. However, the court was told he did eventually use the information for his 'personal life'. Police matched his mobile phone billing to people he had accessed on the police computer system, the court heard. Hughes, from Leeds, resigned from his job with West Yorkshire Police last July. Judge Neil Clark said the matters were so serious and the breach of trust so significant that a custodial sentence was necessary. He said: 'It gives me no pleasure in having to deal with someone like you in this court. 'You have let yourself and those who admire, trust and support you down.' He said the police officer, who was highly regarded by colleagues, had committed a 'dreadful breach of trust'. Mitigating Nicholas Worsley said his client was devastated as his 'entire life is the police force'. He said his life spiralled out of control when the relationship ended and 'depression set in'. He said he was 'batting above himself' in terms of the relationship and as a result had got into debt buying presents and holidays. 'This is a man who has lost everything. He has brought shame on himself and his family.' The offences took place between February 2010 and July last year.","James Hughes owed £60,000 after failed relationship .

Legend: Nolan Miller, the 79-year-old designer behind the Eighties show Dynasty, passed away on Wednesday after a long battle with lung cancer . Nolan Miller, whose over-the-top costumes on Dynasty defined Eighties fashion, has died. The designer, who was 79, passed away in his sleep on Wednesday at his home in Woodland Hills, California, following a six-year battle with lung cancer. His death was confirmed yesterday by longtime friend Joan Collins. The actress told her Twitter . followers: 'My dear friend Nolan Miller died peacefully in his sleep . last night. He was a huge part of my life and I will miss him terribly. Rest now NM.' Miller's lavish creations, including the extravagant-shouldered gowns . often seen on Dynasty's female stars, won him an Emmy in 1984 and six . nominations. He began designing costumes for the show in 1981 and the series ended in 1989. The sequined gowns, fur stoles and wide-brimmed hats he created for Joan Collins' character Alexis Carrington Colby became some of the era's most iconic style pieces. It certainly inspired the thick shoulder pad trend which proved prevalent during the Eighties. According to the New York Times, his weekly wardrobe budget was $35,000 and he created more than 30,000 costumes over the years. The Texas-born designer once said: 'I never want to see them wearing the same outfit twice.' As a friend of the late Aaron . Spelling and Douglas S. Cramer, who worked as executive producers on Dynasty, Mr Miller also worked on further projects with the pair. His designs featured in Charlie's Angels, The Love Boat and Green Acres as well as more than 40 feature films. He designed Morticia's famous long black gown in the Addams Family. A beige dress of his that was encrusted with silver beads was seen on Gilligan's Island, worn by Ginger who was played by Tina Louise. Razzle dazzle: The designer began creating costumes for the show (above l-r: Joan Collins, John Forsythe, Linda Evans) in 1981 and received six Emmy nominations for his work. He won an Emmy award in 1984 . Mr Cramer told the paper: 'It was Nolan's real vision of not just the clothes, but of the surroundings and milieu that were so important... I always referred to him as Aaron's secret weapon.' 'Everything matches; the suit, the hats, the gloves, the jewellery' The designer once said: 'Everything matches; the suit, the hats, the gloves, the jewellery. When she walks down the hall, you may not know who she is, but . you know she's rich, and you know you better get out of the way.' His on-screen designs were so successful that he launched his own collection of men's suits in 1987 within the Leslie Fay Company. After the Leslie Fay company went bankrupt in 1995, he began manufacturing his own work but the venture did not last long - he closed his business one and a half years later. But even after its closure, Miller was determined to create designs for the mass market. Talented: He also created Morticia Addams' famous black gown (left) which was worn by the late actress Carolyn Jones in the series, as well as many costumes from Charlie's Angels (right) He developed a costume jewellery line during the late Eighties which was sold on QVC, the home shopping network, up until last year. He even gave the suit business another go and signed a deal with the Morgan Miller brand which gave him his own line of suits. The designer was also said to be enamored by Hollywood's leading screen starlets. Bob Mackie, a costume designer who was friends with Miller, said: 'He very much loved that Hollywood lady. I would say three or four times a week, he would be seen with an actress on his arm wearing his dress.' Fancy: His creations, seen above, sparked the huge Eighties fashion trend of wearing thick shoulder pads . He married Sandra Stream Miller, his now deceased ex-wife in 1980 after meeting her through her daughter who he had designed a debutante gown for. The pair divorced in 1993. No other immediate family members of Miller's survive. He had been living at the Motion Picture And Television Country House And Hospital.","Close friend Joan Collins confirmed the news via Twitter .

Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said that his officers arrested just 10 people yesterday for minor offences . Police have made just 10 arrests during the Jubilee celebrations in London, the country’s most senior officer said today. Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said that despite one-and-a-half million people being out on the streets in London yesterday to see the royal flotilla, his officers arrested just 10 people for minor public order offences like drunkenness. A further 250,000 people were expected on the streets of London today to watch the concert outside Buckingham Palace, he said. Elsewhere in Britain, police were busier, closing an illegal Jubilee party in Southampton and in Dartmoor officers were forced to swoop on an illegal rave attended by 1,500 people. Speaking as he mingled with the crowds in the Mall, Mr Hogan-Howe said he hoped the rain held off for the rest of today. He said: 'We have had absolutely no problems at all yet. It seems to have gone really well. We had one and a half million people out yesterday and made just 10 arrests so that is not bad. 'We had some long hours yesterday and it was wet and cold but my officers made sure people got home safe. 'We just really hope the weather holds up and people can enjoy this unique concert in front of Buckingham Palace. Our main job is to keep people safe and make sure they can enjoy themselves.' Police clashed with angry revellers as they swooped to close down the illegal Jubilee party on Southampton Common, in Southampton, Hampshire. A jeering crowd threw bottles and cans at officers when they sprang from behind bushes to seize a sound system. Dozens of officers assembled to close down the rave after organisers failed to turn off loud music that was blasted out for over an hour.

"By . Mail Foreign Service . UPDATED: . 11:23 EST, 27 September 2011 . The FTSE closed down 56 points this afternoon as a warning from the IMF on the UK economy added to doubts over the global economic recovery. Relief overnight that the U.S. Congress had voted to raise its debt ceiling soon dissipated after poor manufacturing data from the U.S., Europe and China overnight reminded traders of the fragility of the world economy. The warnings transferred to the Stock Exchange, which closed down 56.04 points at 5718.4, its lowest figure since the end of June. The index had fallen across the day with a fall of 42 points coming following the International Monetary Fund's warning that Britain will have a 'bumpy and uneven recovery'. Today's fall followed an overall drop of 40 points yesterday, when early euphoria about the U.S deal quickly fizzled out as the scale of cutbacks sank in, coupled with worry about the depth of political disagreements in the USA. Backlash: Obama has faced criticism over his last-minute deal to save America from a debt default . But British gloom about slow growth . was intensified by an International Monetary Fund report that predicted . families would be an average £1,500 worse off for the next five years . because of higher taxes and lower benefits imposed by the Government’s . deficit-reduction programme. However, Chancellor George Osborne . received a boost as UK gilt prices fell to a record low, seen as a vote . of confidence in Britain’s financial stability. Debate continues to rage in America after lawmakers passed an . 11th-hour bill to raise the U.S. lending limit and avoid a . calamitous debt default, but Barack Obama still faces an angry backlash. Despite successfully passing the . rescue package, the President must now deal with criticism from both . sides of the aisle over the uneasy compromises that were made to pass . the legislation. The . 269-161 vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives drew a . line under the crisis with hours left before the U.S. ran out of cash . to pay its bills. Announcement: President Barack Obama arrives to speak from the White House briefing room about a deal being reached to raise the debt limit . Both Republicans and Democrats saw the bill as an unpalatable necessity and were only able to reach acceptable terms after weeks of bickering and brinkmanship. It will not be official until the Democrat majority in the U.S. Senate rubber stamps the deal this afternoon and it is signed into law by President Obama. But, coming after weeks of uncertaintly, the deal allays fears that another delay would leave the U.S. government facing an unprecedented default. The drama was heightened last night by the return of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords to Congress for the first time since being shot in Tucson in January to cast her vote, to a resounding round of cheers. But even as leaders from both parties scrambled to get enough votes to pass the deal on Capitol Hill, new storm clouds were gathering over the ailing U.S. economy. More bad economic news and finger-pointing in Washington quickly overshadowed early optimism on Wall Street over the debt deal – with fears persisting that America will still see its credit rating downgraded this week. Hopeful: U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Whip Jon Kyl walk to the Senate ahead of yesterday's, as a deal on the debt crisis becomes 'very close' Early gains in the Dow Jones Index were quickly lost as official figures showed virtually zero manufacturing growth in the U.S.. The FTSE 100 Index was also  typical of stock markets worldwide in rising in early trading before closing at a loss by the day’s end. The President and Democrats in Congress were forced into an uneasy compromise with their Republican opponents to forestall the crisis. This led to Mr Obama being accused of selling out his principles to boost his re-election chances in next year’s presidential race. Plunge: The FTSE rallied briefly yesterday morning but then went off a cliff after the release of U.S. manufacturing figures this afternoon . The deal thrashed out between party leaders will see America’s legal ‘debt ceiling’ rise by up to £1.46trillion – from the £8.71trillion limit it formally reaches today – which will take the country beyond the election and into 2013. But this rise in borrowing will have to be matched by deep spending cuts over the next decade, which are likely to affect welfare programmes and medical care for the poor. Crucially, the Democrats have also failed to secure any tax rises as part of the deal. President Obama said yesterday: ‘This has been a long and messy process. As with any compromise, the outcome is far from satisfying.’ He added: ‘Is this the deal I would have preferred? No.’ Democrat Congressman Emanuel Cleaver was more damning about the President’s capitulation to Republican demands, describing the plan as a ‘sugar-coated Satan sandwich’. At last: President Barack Obama's deal to raise the U.S. the debt ceiling gave a brief boost to the UK stock market before an afternoon plunge . The President admitted the deal cuts domestic spending to percentage levels not seen in more than half a century, but said his biggest priority was to avert the global economic chaos that could have followed a default. Conservative lawmakers, meanwhile, toasted a major defeat for the administration. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the chief Republican negotiator, said: ‘The White House bid to raise taxes has been shut down.’ The only solace for the President appeared to be that he point blank refused to accept a short-term solution and has put off another polarising and acrimonious debate on the debt ceiling until after next November’s election day. The rancour raised concerns over whether the debt deal would be pushed through in time. The bill had to be passed by  lawmakers in both houses of Congress before Mr Obama could sign it into law. The Democrat-controlled Senate was expected to be relatively straightforward, but first, Republican leaders in the House of Representatives had to overcome a Tea Party rebellion to cobble together enough votes to keep the deal alive. By passing the plan, the U.S. would beat the midnight deadline to avoid an unprecedented default on payments to investors in Treasury bonds and businesses that do work for the government.","Index closes down 56 points following yesterday's 40 point drop .

'She hasn't needed to wear a disguise because of the physical transformation.' The source added that she has turned . to comfort eating and pops out at night to rent films and collect food . from restaurants - but won't stay anywhere too long. 'Casey doesn't feel safe anywhere and just wants to leave the country and begin a new life,' the source added.

The source said: 'She was really ready to move on with her life. This has ruined everything.'

When asked about his first celebrity crush during an interview with Carol Vorderman for Tesco Magazine, Mr Cameron said: 'I’m afraid, like everyone else, I think I had that poster of Cheryl Tiegs on my wall.'

'I think he's so smart and attractive. I . do love a good British accent. It sort of melts my heart. 'This has caught me by surprise. Cameron and I should definitely meet sometime, just to say ''hey''.' Mr Cameron . has talked openly in the interview about his family life, saying he . plays 'good cop' with the children and loves making rhubarb crumble. The Prime Minister also spoke of his family’s struggle to deal with the death of his father in 2010. Mr Cameron was asked about the impact of the unexpected death of his father Ian two years ago on his mother Mary and the family. 'It was a very big shock to everybody, obviously, and to mum, because they were married for more than 46 years,' he said. 'I think mum still feels lonely. But the good thing is that she’s got lots of grandchildren. She’s a pretty active granny. If you want any support with childcare, you’ve got to book in pretty early.' Mr Cameron said he and wife Samantha sometimes used the 'good cop, bad cop' routine to help control their son Elwen, six, and daughter Florence, who is nearly two. 'I’m usually the good cop,' he said. 'Sam’s brilliant at just playing with the children and having a great time. 'I’m more of a typical dad - let’s go and plant the vegetables, let’s go on a cycle ride, or let’s do a structured activity. My biggest obsession with the kids is cooking. It’s brilliant.' Mr Cameron went on: 'I do a lot of cooking anyway but I’ve got into more child-friendly cooking such as pancakes, baking, rhubarb crumble - anything that involves getting messy and licking the bowl. 'As a kid, that was always the most exciting thing.' The premier praised his high-flying wife as 'super-organised' and said he tries to spend lunchtime with the family in the flat above Downing Street. 'I know if I spend time with Florence, I get more out of her,' he said. 'She appears when I walk into the flat and pats the sofa, as if to say ‘now, sit down, don’t just come up here and eat your lunch’.' 'She’s worried I’m going to rush in and out, which is what I often have to do. 'I think a framework is also important.

The boyfriend of the hang glider who plummeted one thousand feet to her death last week screamed 'Hang on! I love you' while he watched helplessly as she died, witnesses revealed. Hang-gliding enthusiasts gathered at the site of Lenami Godinez-Avila's death in a forest clearing near Agassiz, British Columbia, yesterday to pay their respects after the April 28 tragedy. It was the first time the 27-year-old had ever experienced a hang glider and was part of the anniversary celebrations with her boyfriend David. Memorial: A group of hang gliders gathered at the place where Lenami Godinez-Avila died to plant a cherry blossom tree and erect a cross a week after her death . Hang glider pilot Jon Orders was held in custody until Friday following allegations he swallowed a video card - which police have since obtained - which recorded events leading up to the incident . Scene: Hang gliders and emergency workers rush to where Lenami Godinez-Avila's body was found after she plummeted 1,000 feet to her death last Suaturday . On Saturday, a small group - most of whom had never met Lenami - erected a cross and planted a cherry blossom tree as a memorial, Canada's CTV reported. Nicole McLearn who was there the day Lenami died said the couple were 'joyous' as they watched the other hang gliders take to the air, growing excited about their turn. She told the Post Media News that as soon as she and instructor William Jonathan Orders became airbound, it was clear something was wrong. She said: 'I could see her starting to slip down his body ... past the waist, down . the legs. Finally she got to the feet and tried to hang on and . obviously couldn't hang on for that much longer and let go, tearing off . the tandem pilot's shoes in the process.' Police investigating the death of Lenami Godinez-Avila, left, have seized a video card which they say had been swallowed by hang-glider pilot Jon Orders, right . Witness: Nicole McLearn said it became obvious as soon as they took off that something was not right as the instructor was horizontal and Lenami was hanging vertical . Usually an instructor and the student . should be side by side, but Lenami was below him and it became obvious . she was not hooked in. Miss McLearn said it . appeared that Godinez-Avila’s feet were dangling, meaning she was . relying on her upper body to hold on and the instructor was trying to . wrap his legs around her torso. She was only in the air about 30 seconds before she died. At the launch site, her boyfriend watched what was happening and screamed as she fell: 'No! Lenami! Hang on! I love you!' Hang glider pilot Jon Orders has been held in custody following allegations that he swallowed a video card which may have recorded events leading up to the incident. He was granted bail on Friday when he appeared in a provincial court in Chilliwack, British Columbia. Earlier this week, Royal Canadian Mounted Police told a court that X-rays showed the card was inside Orders' body. But officers confirmed yesterday that they now have the card. 'We . have processes in place in order to try and extract what's been on the . card that will not be further discussed at the moment,' Police Constable . Tracy Wolbeck said. Ms Wolbeck said police were focusing on answering questions from Miss Godinez-Avila's family, from Mexico. Search for clues: Police examined the hang-glider after the body of Miss Godinez-Avila was found . Crash site: Police believe information stored on a video card could help explain why the incident happened . 'They've come to Canada in search of answers,' the police officer added. Police have not provided any further details about when the card was consumed or how they learned about it. They have also said they have seized video taken by the boyfriend on the ground. Orders is a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor with 16 years' experience. His business website, Vancouver Hang Gliding, states that photos and video are available when people purchase a tandem hang-gliding trip. When police announced the charge on Monday, they said Orders was accused of withholding key evidence. The young woman's body was found in a forest clear cut below Mount Woodside, a popular spot for hang gliders to launch from above British Columbia's Fraser Valley. Jason Warner, safety officer for the Hang Gliders and Paragliders Association of Canada, said that he spoke to Orders minutes after Godinez-Avila fell from the glider. Accused: Orders, a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor with 16 years' experience, was granted bail yesterday . Mr Warner said Orders told him he knew something was wrong almost immediately and tried desperately to hang on to the woman, who clung to his body and then slipped down his legs, taking one of Orders' shoes with her. Miss Godinez-Avila, who was an . administrator at the provincial Ministry of Environment, went hang . gliding after her boyfriend bought her lessons for their anniversary. He was video-recording the flight, but had stopped taping before she fell. Friends of Miss Godinez-Avila have set up a memorial fund and scholarship to remember her.

Innocent: Miss Cooper admitted to being 'cheeky' but denied any wrongdoing - she was cleared of all charges . A lesbian police community support officer who was accused of groping five colleagues sobbed in court after she was cleared of all charges. Sylvia Cooper, 45, said she wanted to get back to an ordinary life following her 'two year nightmare' and accused her fellow cops of making the allegations because they were jealous of her success. She was accused of groping three female officers' breasts and bottoms, as well as grabbing the genitals of two male cops. Miss Cooper was also accused of propositioning a female colleague by asking her if she 'fancied a shag'. Miss Cooper, who was a PCSO with West Midlands Police for five years before she was forced to resign, told the jury at Warwick Crown Court she had been 'shocked and horrified' when she learned of the allegations made against her by two female PCSOs, two male police constables and a male PCSO. Two days before the allegations were put to her, Cooper had been presented with a Women in Policing award in front of about 200 people. The jury found Miss Cooper, of Stourbridge, West Mids, not guilty of eight counts of sexual assault after deliberating for seven hours and 41 minutes. Innocent Cooper had worked in the prison service for more than ten years and then for a security firm until joining the police as a PCSO in the West Midlands in August 2005. During her four-day trial Miss Cooper was described as 'a credit to the service'. But Miss Cooper told the court there had been 'a hell of a lot of jealousy' after she got the award, which she had been recommended by her sergeant. She told defence barrister Martin Steen: 'I broke down in tears. I couldn’t believe it, I was so shocked and horrified.' Miss Cooper admitted being 'cheeky' and giving one of her female colleagues 'a childhood flick on the bottom' as they walked up a flight of stairs at a police station. She also admitted joking with a male colleague that he had a 'nice package' when he walked into police station wearing a pair of cycling shorts. Miss Cooper mouthed 'thank you' to the jury and sobbed with relief as the verdict was read out on Monday. 'Hell of a lot of jealously' - Miss Cooper believes the the true reason behind the allegations was envy . Outside court Miss Cooper accused her colleagues of falsely accusing her because they were jealous of her because she won a prestigious policing award. She said: 'I’m grateful to the jury for their careful deliberations. 'I was falsely accused by some who were resentful that I had been put forward for the Women in Policing community award. 'The last two years have been a nightmare. I hope I may now be allowed to continue my life in the ordinary way.' Her partner Rebecca Morris added: 'At last. It’s been two years.

Cambridge University has beaten arch-rival Oxford to the top of the rankings for a second year running, pulling ahead across a variety of new tables. This has been attributed to a decline in job prospects for Oxford graduates, with the recession having a major affect on the rankings. The blow comes despite the fact that Oxford handed good degrees to 91 per cent of honours students last year and Cambridge 87 per cent. Strong performance: Clare College at Cambridge, which has exerted its dominance for a second year running . At the other end of the list, just 44 per cent of University of East London graduates achieved a 2:1 or above. There are various league tables for British universities - helping students pick an institution by ranking them for subject, student satisfaction, teaching, research and other categories for the whole of the year ahead. Over 62 key subjects, Cambridge takes top place in 30 of the 46 it offers, and is in the top ten for all 46. Oxford is in the leading 10 universities for all 32 of its subjects, and is placed first in 12. Entry requirements are being toughened up to reflect the dominance of the ancient university, with the average student accepted to Cambridge now having the equivalent of almost five A grades. But Philip Walker from the Higher Education Funding Council of England warned prospective students that league tables should not be looked at on their own when working out if a university is for you. 'It gives you some sort of broad guidance, but if you are an undergraduate - for example - you will just be interested in the university's score for teaching, not research, which is also included in the rankings. 'There are a range of things you need to do, including going to look at the university.' Last month's tables from by the Complete University Guide showed the London School of Economics pushing Oxford into third place. This was put down to the fact that LSE concentrates on a narrower range of subjects, and bucked the recession by increasing graduate employment rates. It was the first time in the 15-year history of the tables Oxford has been beaten by the LSE, although it has previously been beaten in the table by Imperial College London - in 1999 and 2000, when it again took third place. However, Oxford has taken top spot in the tables more times than Cambridge over the past decade. The LSE is in the top ten for all 12 key subjects it offers and is top for three. Dr Bernard Kingston, principal author of the Complete University Guide, said rises and falls in the rankings were driven to a considerable extent by the recession. Recession-hit: Oxford University's slip has been blamed on student job prospects declining steeply in the financial crisis . He suggested employers who typically recruit Oxbridge graduates may be struggling, affecting their employment rates. 'The employment market for graduates remains challenging and this is reflected in the rankings. Some universities have been more successful than others in adapting to the new conditions,' he said. Cambridge has also come top in the 2013 Guardian University Guide league table for the second year running, while Oxford came second and the London School of Economics climbed a place to third. St Andrews, rated third last year, is now in fourth place, while Warwick rose a place to fifth. University College London (UCL), Durham, Lancaster, Bath and Exeter make up the top 10. Universities are ranked according to spending per student; their student/staff ratio; graduate career prospects; what grades applicants need; a value-added score that compares students' entry qualifications with their final degree results; and how happy final-year students are with their courses, based on the annual National Student Survey.","Cambridge takes top place in 30 of the 46 key subjects it offers .

A high-flying Channel 4 executive who was found dead at her home could have been saved by a mental health centre she visited, her father claimed today. Sarah Mulvey overdosed in her north London flat after being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder related to the 'extreme pressures' of her job and a grievance procedure at work. Her father attacked the two centres that tried to help the 35-year-old commissioning editor, who died a day after visiting the Drayton Park crisis centre in Camden. Critical: Dr Christopher Mulvey attacked the mental health centre his daughter Sarah visited the day before her death for missing opportunities to save her . Her father, Dr Christopher Mulvey, told the court that staff at the crisis centre should have made more effort to contact her doctors after she left, adding: 'There were so many opportunities to help her at this point and they were not taken.' Her body was discovered by her partner Mr Gillett at her £350,000 two-bedroom rented flat in Hampstead, north London. Miss Mulvey had stayed at Causeway Retreat, a rehabilitation centre on Osea Island in Essex, in May 2009, after being signed off from work with stress in May 2009. The £10,000-a-week Causeway, whose former patients also include singer Amy Winehouse, has since been shut down after it was discovered to be operating as an unlicensed hospital. But she left the following September because she struggled to cope with the methods being used to treat her. While there she argued with staff about her care and harmed herself, and the day before she left she made an apparent suicide attempt. Dr Mulvey said: 'She was rejected, in my view, by the Causeway Retreat and the manager, a hotelier by trade, who said she had to leave in 20 minutes. Happier times: Sarah Mulvey, centre, aged 16 with her parents Christopher and Jean Mulvey . ‘I am not quite sure of the clinical basis of that decision, but this preceded the crisis.’ Miss Mulvey found the therapy at Causeway was largely focused on addictive patients, and struggled to get the treatment she wanted, the court heard. She was given a combination of drugs, including anti-depressants, and underwent EMDR, a form of psychotherapy used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. After the treatment started, Miss Mulvey's family said she contacted them less frequently. Her mother, Jean Mulvey, discovered when she later visited that her daughter had been self-harming, and was burning her arms with cigarettes. Dr Mulvey said his wife had been 'aghast' when she saw her daughter, describing her as 'extremely thin, lifeless and medicated at that point in time'. Miss Mulvey also told her mother she had become extremely distressed following the EMDR sessions, and was left in a 'dissociative state'. A friend who visited complained about the medication she was given, as did Miss Mulvey, and in September 2009 she was told to leave the centre. Mr Gillett, left, found Miss Mulvey's body after she overdosed at her £350,000 rented flat in Hampstead . But one of her psychiatrists called her a 'narcissist' who thought she was a 'superior human being,' the inquest heard. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Mike McPhillips, who treated Miss Mulvey during her stay at Causeway, said she took an instant dislike to him and was difficult to help. He told the court: 'She told me she was wary of doctors. I don't think she had a very high opinion of the abilities of the doctors treating her. 'She was polite but frosty and had a veiled aggression towards me. She could be curt, dismissive. 'She wouldn't discuss her suicidal thoughts with me as she was frightened if she did she would be sectioned.' He added: 'She was narcissistic. She had a high opinion of herself and her own intelligence and ability to control her mental state. 'She considered herself a superior human being, and I don't deny that she was, but her sense of self importance went beyond ordinary sense of pride.' High-flying TV talent: Sarah Mulvey at a documentary festival in Sheffield . The following January, she visited Drayton Park, but overdosed at her home after storming out when staff tried to encourage her to take her medication, the inquest at St Pancras Coroner’s Court heard. Dr Mulvey said: 'We find it absolutely incredible that no one - after Sarah had stormed out in an obviously deeply distressed state - no one at the crisis centre had impressed on the GP centre the importance of the situation. 'She was known to be suicidal, and she had said at Causeway Retreat she would not commit suicide on the premises. The importance of that to me is quite clear. ‘Her doctor said if someone had contacted him, he would have been in touch with Sarah straight away.’ The court heard Miss Mulvey, who was born in Brighton, had been 'delightful, intelligent and articulate', studying at Oxford before gaining a Master's degree at Cambridge University. She was a Commissioning Editor at Channel 4, in charge of making top programmes like Ten Years Younger, Brat Camp and How To Look Good Naked. She became embroiled in a grievance procedure, however, and a subsequent appeal. Her father said: 'She became at first extremely stressed and then psychologically unwell. 'She had been to GPs on previous occasions saying that she was terribly stressed out or couldn't cope, but there was a very, very heavy work schedule with her job.' The inquest, which is expected to end tomorrow, continues.","Her father attacked both rehab clinics that tried to help the TV executive .

The daughter of actress Natalie Wood will not face charges after being caught possessing cocaine and heroin because police illegally searched her house. Last month police responded to a call that neighbours heard a gunshot inside Courtney Wagner’s Malibu home. They found cocaine and heroin inside and arrested Wagner. However, the L.A County D.A has dropped the case after police broke Wagner’s 4th Amendment rights, reported TMZ today. Charges dropped: Courtney Wagner as she is now (left) and (right) with her late mother Natalie Wood in 1981 . ‘Deputies did not have probable cause, consent, nor a warrant to conduct the search and recover narcotics so as a result the case is being rejected because of illegal search and seizure,’ according to the D.A. Wagner allegedly got involved in a furious row with a man on April 29 when a gun went off. Neighbours called police after claiming they heard a woman screaming and the weapon discharge. When officers arrived, they found Wagner in possession of cocaine and heroin, law enforcement sources told TMZ. She was held on suspicion of felony drug possession. The man was arrested for the alleged negligent discharge of a firearm, it is not clear if the case against him has also been dropped. It is not believed anyone was injured in the incident. According to an article on TMZ.com, Courtney since posted $10,000 bail. Wagner is the daughter of late actress Wood and her husband, actor Robert Wagner. Natalie Wood drowned in mysterious circumstances sometime after the evening of November 28, 1981, when the 43-year-old actress was boating off Catalina Island with Robert Wagner and actor Christopher Walken. Heated argument: Courtney Wagner, pictured with her father Robert Wagner in 2007, was reportedly involved in a screaming row when neighbours heard a weapon discharge on April 29 . Wagner - a former jewellery designer - was just seven years old when her mother died. Speaking in a 2004 interview, she recounted her memory of the tragedy and coping with the aftermath. She said: 'I don't remember very much about my mother. I do remember her laugh and the way she smelt, and I remember her hands - things like that that made me feel close to her. '(After her death) My father and I and my sisters started travelling a lot. We went to Switzerland and spent a lot of time there, which I think was important. 'I think that everything Dad did then - like not being around this crazed atmosphere in LA with the paparazzi - was a good idea. It brought us all closer together. And I always had compassion and respect for him for keeping the family together - it could easily have fallen apart.' The mysterious nature of Natalie Wood's death prompted claims she was the victim of homicide. Just last year Los Angeles police re-opened their investigation into her death, citing 'substantial new evidence' led them to re-open their investigation into her death. But in January they announced that there was nothing to suggest foul play and ruled the death an accident. Mother: Natalie Wood, pictured with husband Robert Wagner in 1980, drowned while boating off Catalina Island a year later . The evening before the drowning, Wood, Wagner and Walken, who was Wood's co-star in the film 'Brainstorm,' had dinner at a restaurant on the island. According to ship Captain Dennis Davern’s sworn statement to detectives, the trio returned to the yacht and had drinks and Wagner and Walken got into an argument. A furious Robert Wagner shouted 'Do you want to f*** my wife' at Walken as he smashed a bottle of wine in the moments before Natalie Wood fell overboard, Mr Davern claimed. The captain told the officers when he showed up on the open deck where Woods and Wagner had been arguing, Mr Davern said 'Wagner was present, and he stood near the far rear wall of the yacht.' Wagner has always maintained Wood accidentally slipped and drowned as she drunkenly tried to tie up a dinghy against the boat. Police say he is not considered a suspect. Chief detective William McSweeney said in January that cold cases like Wood's are never really closed and that detectives are still looking at some aspects of the case.","Police were called to Courtney Wagner's Malibu home after neighbours heard 'screaming and gunshot' last month .

A 63-stone teenage girl, who last week had to be rescued from her own home, had been struggling with the guilt of dumping a mystery boyfriend, it emerged today. Georgia Davis, 19, who was hauled into hospital after being unable to stand because of her weight, ended the relationship with the man she met online despite him telling her she was 'Mrs Right'. The Sun reported how Miss Davis, from Aberdare, South Wales, had lamented to friends on Facebook about the admirer in February. She posted: 'What to do?! Why can’t love be easy? I’ve got some thinking to do. I don’t love him like he claims to love me - I’m pretty sure he thinks I’m Mrs Right. 'I don’t want to hurt him the way he’s claiming I’m hurting him. I know I shouldn’t be in this relationship it’s not right on us both.' Heartache: 63 stone Georgia Davis, 19, from Aberdare, South Wales, was struggling with the guilt of dumping a mystery boyfriend . It had been thought that Miss Davis piled on the pounds after her stepfather Arthur Treloar was diagnosed with lung cancer. But a former schoolfriend of the teenager told The Sun: 'She couldn’t deal with the high emotions of her relationship and when it ended she was so upset she just turned to food.' The couple are said to have got together after Miss Davis quit a U.S. fat camp in 2009. On Thursday emergency service workers were forced to smash their way the family home after Miss Davis called out to her mother that she could not even stand up. The teenager then had to wait eight hours as walls were knocked down before she could be carried from her home into an ambulance. Stepfather Mr Treloar said: 'It breaks my heart to think of what poor Georgia has been through. It's all my fault. 'She had watched her own dad die of a heart attack when she was a toddler. One day she turned to me and said: 'I've lost one dad - I can't lose another.' A 10ft by 10ft space was cut into to the top floor of the house in Aberdare, South Wales, so that the emergency services could remove the teenager . The scene as Miss Davis was removed from her home and loaded into an ambulance last week . It cost an estimated £100,000 as emergency workers spent eight hours cutting her free as two walls of her home in Aberdare, South Wales, were demolished to remove her from her first-floor bedroom. She remained at the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil over the weekend while doctors continued to test for medical complaints including diabetes, kidney disease, spinal problems and respiratory failure. Her heart rate and blood pressure are being constantly monitored. Britain's fattest teenager had told friends on Facebook of her fears for her life because of her diet of junk food, chocolate and fizzy drinks. She said: 'We all die in the end...but food will inevitably kill me. I can't handle losing weight, my stepdad's lung cancer, mum's sickness and my depression all at once.' Ambulance men, paramedics, contractors from RCT homes, police, firemen, social workers all helped in the operation . A bridge was also built from the roadside to the top floor with between 30 to 40 people involved in the operation . Mr Treloar, 73, told the Sun on Sunday how his step-daughter had been gaining weight since her return from fat camp - staying in her bedroom watching television or messaging her friends. He said she managed to come downstairs to eat or talk to her family by sliding down on her bottom, but last Monday she confessed she could no longer stand up. 'Georgia had been in terrible pain for a long time from sores and swelling in her feet, but as usual she was trying to protect me and her mum so she kept if from us, ' added Mr Treloar. Over 40 firemen, medics and engineers took part in the operation last Thursday to rescue Miss Davis and take her to hospital in a reinforced ambulance after her mother Lesley called a doctor. It was the first time she had been out of the house in six months. Friends and neighbours claim Mrs Davis, 57, bought all her daughter's food which included processed ready-meals, sandwiches and packs of peanuts and crisps. She is also partial to sausages, pasties, chips, chocolate and chunks of cheese with bottles of coke or pints of milk.’ The cost of removing Miss Davis is estimated to cost £100,000 to cover manpower, plus the emergency call-out and the reconstruction of the demolished walls . The operation began just after 9am, and she was seen leaving the scene in an ambulance just after 5pm . She has previously spoken of her guilt over the teenager’s obesity. She has said of Miss Davis's weight: ‘I feel guilty, of course I do.’ In an interview, she said she and her daughter had started comfort eating after her husband Geoff died when Miss Davis was five. But she said she had later made a determined effort to change their diets – such as making her own chips instead of buying them from the takeaway. She said in the interview: ‘I wish I could turn back the clock. But if you’ve never had food addiction, you can’t understand. You try to fight it but it’s like a drug.’ In 2008, Miss Davis told reporters: ‘Some people choose heroin but I’ve chosen food and it’s killing me.’ In the past, she has spoken of eating ‘a couple of loaves-worth of sandwiches filled with jam or cheese or meat’ every day. Miss Davis lost 15 stone after her visit to a U.S. weight loss camp (left) but was piling on the pounds by September last year (right) Georgia Davis, aged 17, was weighing around 40st. Pictured with her mother Lesley . This was in addition to five bags of cheese and onion crisps, two packets of chocolate bourbons, sponge cake, trifle chocolate cake, and four sausages with mashed potato and baked beans for dinner, as well as fizzy drinks. She consumed as much as 13,000 calories a day. Miss Davis returned from the Wellspring Academy in North Carolina, in June 2009, weighing around 19st after losing 14st 6lbs by ditching her diet of cheese, biscuits and chocolate for regular exercise salads and lean meat. But when she learned of her stepfather's cancer, she would not go back to the fat camp. Mr Treloar told the Sun: 'It was the beginning of the end because she refused to return to America and for that I blame myself. It was difficult for Georgia to maintain her weight loss because she couldn't find the right foods in the supermarket in Aberdare.' Her mother says Georgia was always a large child, pictured here eating a lolly as a toddler . Early signs: Miss Davis was an overweight toddler, and the rapid growth has continued to this day . Mr Treloar revealed that Miss Davis had been forced to wear a bed sheet because clothes no longer fitted her. Now doctors have told her she can only have 2,000 calories a day to ensure she loses weight. He said: 'She is feeling depressed but we're doing our best to keep her spirits up. She's sick and we're worried sick.' On Facebook, Miss Davis told friends she was not coping with her family's health.  She said: 'I have my issues. At the moment dealing with everything is too much. 'I need to take it one step at a time, but I will fix all this.' She confessed that she was smoking heavily to avoid comfort eating and had contracted an infection. 'My life cannot get possibly worse,' she said. 'I have needs sorting out because it's added loads more weight on to me. It's unbearable now.' A hospital spokesman said: ‘This young lady has had a settled night and has been seen this morning by the consultant in charge of her care. ‘Initial assessments have been undertaken and she will be undergoing further assessment during the day to assist in her plan of care.’","Georgia Davis, 19, met man online after quitting a U.S. fat camp in 2009 .

Friends say she is upset after being bombarded with sick jokes and cruel remarks since being rushed to hospital for complications brought on by obesity. Miss Davis - who spent hours on Facebook while housebound due to her size - was yesterday stable in hospital as doctors tried to treat her obesity. As well as having her personal account abused the teenager also had to contend with one troll creating a new Facebook page called RIP Georgia Davis - which has since been taken down. The page said: 'You are just a big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope you die soon. 'You fat blob, you are adding millions of pounds to the tax payers bill. If I had my way I would wipe that fat grin off your face by making you pay us back.' Another anonymous commenter said: 'Why don’t you just stop eating so much you fat fool. The rise in popularity of social networking sites has been accompanied by a worrying increase in computer screen harassers known as 'trolls'. They are people who post deliberately sick and inflammatory messages on web pages and forums to provoke anger and upset. Sean Duffy, 26, from Reading, Berkshire, who targeted dead teenagers and cruelly . mocked their deaths was banned from social networking sites in March. He admitted defacing a tribute site set up to remember schoolgirl Sophie Taylor, 16, who was shot accidentally by her boyfriend. Duffy was sentenced to a community payback order with supervision for two years and told to do 300 hours of unpaid work. People in the public eye have also been targeted by trolls. Comedian Dom Joly called the police after a Twitter account was set up by somebody writing abusive messages about his two children. And student Liam Stacey, 21, who mocked footballer Fabrice Muamba on Twitter after he collapsed during a match, was jailed for 56 days for inciting racial hatred. 'You are just a big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope you die soon.' Miss Davis had to be cut free from her home in Aberdare, South Wales, in a rescue operation after she became too heavy to leave her bedroom. Around 40 people were tasked with taking down two walls and building a ramp so she could be stretchered to nearby Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. She was yesterday described as stable in hospital as doctors put her on a strict diet to tackle her health problems - including diabetes, kidney failure, spinal and skin problems. But as she lay in bed recovering, trolls set up the fake Facebook tribute page. It was reported to the site by her friends and has now been removed. One message on it read: '63-stone teen dies in hospital - as she hears McDonalds are banning her.' And cyberbullies also took to the networking site Twitter to post vile jokes about her weight. One said: 'Georgia Davis was asked what was her favourite instrument in school? 'She said the dinner bell.' Another wrote: 'Georgia Davis says she was depressed as she has just lost her boyfriend - Has she tried looking in the folds of her skin to see if he’s there?' Miss Davis closed down her Facebook page in an attempt to escape her tormentors - eventhough it was one of the main ways she kept in touch with friends. Major operation: It took 40 people to rescue Miss Davis from her home after she fell ill . One friend close to Miss Davis said: 'It’s an absolute disgrace how people are treating a girl they don’t even know with such disrespect. 'She turned to the internet for support and she gets sick comments like this sent her way. 'She has closed her own Facebook page now and is very upset. Friends: Jade Tarrant (left) lived with Georgia Davis (right), but Miss Davis put on weight again after moving back in with her parents . 'I just want her to be able to focus on getting healthy and in better shape, she doesn’t need mockery like this.' Miss Davis moved in with friend Jade Tarrant but put on weight after she returned home to care for her sick step-father. Miss Tarrant revealed earlier this week how Miss Davis's weight went from 18 stone to 63 stone as she returned to her bad habit of eating junk food. Miss Tarrant, 19, said: 'I always knew it was going to get this bad if she went home again. 'She’d come to live with me because of all the stress. Being with the mum and her step-dad got so stressful. 'She just wanted a break - she wanted some girly time. 'She would have lost weight if she stayed with me because I like my salads and I could have got her on it. 'But she missed her mum and step-dad. She ended up going back and putting her own health at risk.' Miss Davis moved out of their shared home in Aberdare to move back into her parents' home three miles away after her step-father was diagnosed with lung cancer. She tried to be good daughter as her mother struggled with osteoporosis, Miss Tarrant said. But the stress led to her returning to a diet of cakes, chips, burgers and chocolate, washed down by sugary fizzy drinks. Miss Tarrant added: 'If she’d stayed with me her life would have been good, she would have been happy and not had a so many problems on her mind. 'It was the strain of caring for her ill parents which made her eat - it was eating as a way of coping.' She thinks the world of her mum, she loves her and she loves her step-dad - she’s been through a lot. 'I like my salads and I could have got her on it': Jade Tarrant said she could have helped Miss Davis lose weight again . 'Her mum’s osteoporosis and her step-dad’s lung problems had a large impact on her. 'It went wrong when she moved back in with them, she was under a lot of stress and it put her back on the same spot. 'She went back to eating fatty foods and having huge portions every time we went out for a meal.' Miss Davis eventually stopped venturing outside altogether and, by the time a 40-man emergency team cut her free, she had not left the house for about eight months. The teenager is being treated for a range of obesity-related problems at hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. She is suffering from complications including diabetes and kidney failure, as well as problems with her spine, joints and skin. Doctors and obesity experts have put her on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet to help her lose weight. Jade, who is currently pregnant with her first child, said: 'When I saw the situation I was in shock. I broke down and started crying. 'I didn’t even realise it was her, It didn’t look like her, she looked so unhappy. 'I had a fear inside me that something would happen one day but never expected this. 'I really want Georgia to get well and get out of hospital so she can come and see me and my baby.' A hospital spokesman said: 'Georgia is still undergoing investigations and receiving treatment from a range of health professionals. 'We are pleased to advise that her clinical condition is stable.' Scaffolding: The upstairs front wall of Miss Davis's home had to be demolished to free the teenager .","Georgia Davis, 19, has deleted her Facebook page after she was singled out by cyberbullies taunting her for weighing 63 stone .

Brutal: In the video, the protester is not seen provoking the officer before he is smashed in the face . Treatment: Fellow bike riders rushed to the victim's aid after he was hit in the face by a senior Israeli army officer . Ias was treated in a Palestinian hospital for 'light injuries' and today told Israeli media he was 'well'. He told Israel's Channel 10 TV station: 'We were just walking slowly towards the soldiers, we were chanting Palestinian songs calling for the liberation of Palestine. I don't believe that's a provocation.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has condemned the officer's actions. He said: 'This behaviour is not characteristic of IDF (Israel Defence Forces) soldiers and commanders and it has no place in the IDF or in the state of Israel.' Violence: Further scuffles broke out between army officers and the protesters . Protest: Activists trying to get hold of their bikes were told to go away by Israeli army officers . But Israeli military spokesman Yoav Mordechai said that, although the officer's behaviour was unacceptable and he had been suspended following an initial investigation, the edited video 'did not reflect the whole story'. He said: 'These are harsh pictures, but I still can't divorce the filmed episodes from the incident that lasted over an hour. It included violence by the anarchists and Palestinians, (though) this does not justify what we see.' The incident came as Channel 10 broadcast a report on Sunday about how Israel would attack Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomacy and sanctions between the two countries completely break down. Treatment: This protester was taken to an ambulance where her wounds were taken care of, following the incident . Alon Ben-David said he spent several weeks with military pilots to gain a unique insight into Israel's military thinking. He predicted no order would be given to strike before P5+1 talks resume in May. But he added that, if negotiations failed and the order to attack was given, then 'dozens if not more planes' would attack. He said: 'The Israel Air Force does not have the capacity to destroy the entire Iranian programme. The result won’t be definitive.' The attack, the channel said, would presumably trigger a war in northern Israel, with missile attacks.

"By . Baz Bamigboye . PUBLISHED: . 16:32 EST, 21 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:51 EST, 22 June 2012 . Mirren: What... You want me to play the Queen again? Helen Mirren portrayed Queen Elizabeth II for the second time on Tuesday — at a reading of a new play that features Her Maj and some of the 12 Prime Ministers she’s seen during her reign. But there were questions as to whether or not Tony Blair would make the cut. ‘It was rather poignant, seeing Helen as Her Majesty again,’ a friend who was at Tuesday’s  private performance tells me. The monarch will be the only royal in the drama, called The Audience. ‘It’s about the personal, with the background of the political,’ a confidential source tells me. Mirren, who won a best actress Oscar for her stunning portrait of Elizabeth II in The Queen, did a reading of Peter Morgan’s script — which is described as still a work in progress — along with several actors, playing the six or seven PMs who will feature in  the play. Morgan, who also wrote the screenplay for Stephen Frears’s 2006 film, has included Winston Churchill, who was there for the weekly audiences at the beginning of her reign; Harold Wilson; Margaret Thatcher; James Callaghan and John Major. Gordon Brown and David Cameron are possibilities, too, although no one would go on the record about Tony Blair. ‘It focuses on the relationship one person has had, supposedly in private, with a succession of Prime Ministers,’ another insider involved in the production tells me. ‘In the current draft there are six, could be seven, of her PMs, but work continues on the play’s text. ‘It’s far from finished and Peter . likes to keep writing till the last minute. The one constant is the . Queen. The others are her Prime Ministers, and they’re moveable.’ Reunited: Helen Mirren is teaming up again with Peter Morgan, who wrote the screenplay for the Oscar-winning 2006 film The Queen . I understand that those who attended Tuesday’s reading in London found the play ‘very touching, very funny and quite confessional’. ‘Peter has done a lot of background research and spoken to lots of people, in the way he did for The Queen and his TV films about Brown and Blair. ‘There’s stuff in it that people will know about, and some they won’t,’ my source says, although they were quick to add that ‘it’s a play, not a documentary’. ‘It’s not taken from what people have actually said; rather Peter has created a work about what they might have said.’ Stephen Daldry, who is in negotiations to direct The Audience, was at the reading, too, along with producers and associates from the companies run by Matthew Byam Shaw, Robert Fox and Andy Harries (who was one of the producers of The Queen). Celebrated designer Bob Crowley is believed to be in negotiations to create the costumes and sets for The Audience which, if all the various deals can be done, will be in the West End next year. Shakespeare in Love: At a delicate stage . Where art thou (to misquote the Bard) stage version of Oscar-winning film Shakespeare In Love? To borrow another of Will’s favourite phrases, thereby hangs a tale. Once upon a time there was talk that a theatre production of the movie —which won seven Academy Awards including ones for stars Gwyneth  Paltrow and Judi Dench, writers Tom Stoppard and Marc . Norman and best film — was going to have a run in the West End. Initially, Stoppard was going to re-write it for the stage, but he withdrew. So producers Thomas Schumacher, who heads Disney’s theatrical division, and Sonia Friedman contracted Billy Elliot writer Lee Hall. And all was well until a recent workshop of the script involving various actors and director Matthew Warchus, who has won many plaudits for his work on Art, Boeing-Boeing, God Of Carnage and current hit Matilda (he’s working on a new show by Matilda writer Dennis Kelly). Sharp words were exchanged and Warchus has now left the Shakespeare In Love production, so the search is on for a new director. But the play’s the thing and I’m sure all’s well that ends well. We can but hope the show will be ready for next year, or 2014. Image change: Laura Michelle Kelly with co-star Ronan Keating in Cannes . Award-winning actress Laura Michelle Kelly, who won an Olivier when she originated magical nanny Mary Poppins on stage, is casting aside that goody-two-shoes image to play a scarlet woman. Laura Michelle will star as The Second Mrs Tanqueray in a rare revival of Arthur Wing Pinero’s 19th-century ‘woman with a past’ drama at the Rose Theatre in Kingston,  Surrey, for a month from September 27. The play was about as dangerous as you could get in its day, as it told the tale of Paula, a woman who, as Laura Michelle puts it, ‘led a courtesan-type life and then swapped that to become the wife of a very rich man’. ‘It’s almost the reverse of My Fair Lady, in that when she enters the high life, she hasn’t learnt not to say outlandish things and she innocently insults people,’ says Laura Michelle, who also played Eliza Doolittle in Trevor Nunn’s production of My Fair Lady in the West End. The play is also about Victorian-era hypocrisy, she adds, in that Paula pays a price when a man from her past threatens to wreck her new life with her husband and step-daughter. For Laura Michelle it marks a return to the UK stage after two years (on and off) playing Mary Poppins in the Disney- Cameron Mackintosh show on Broadway. She took a break to appear opposite Ronan Keating in the film Goddess, which was shot in Australia. She and Keating attended a special screening of the picture during the Cannes Film Festival last month. Laura Michelle will leave her apartment  in the trendy Williamsburg district of  Brooklyn for rehearsals with The Second Mrs Tanqueray director Stephen Unwin in late August. In between, she’ll continue working with Sting at workshops for the rock star’s  musical The Last Ship, which is set in  Newcastle. And she’ll play Anna in The King And I for six performances at the Muny Theatre in St Louis, Missouri, in early August. The London 2012 Festival is jam-packed with amazing arts, but do see three short films commissioned by BBC Films and Film 4: The Odyssey, by Asif Kapadia; Mike Leigh’s A Running Jump; and Lynne Ramsay’s Swimmer. Also, Rupert Goold’s splendid film of Richard II, with an excellent Ben Whishaw. Shot entirely on location, it’s the first part of the Hollow Crown (Henry IV, Pars 1 & 2, and Henry V to follow) made by the BBC, Neal Street Productions and NBC International.","Helen Mirren dons regal attire for reading of new play on the West End .

A 12-year-old girl collapsed and died of natural causes after being hit by a rugby ball during PE class, a coroner ruled. Leonie Nice was playing tag rugby in the playground at Woodlands Comprehensive School in Basildon, Essex when she collapsed and appeared to suffer a fit after the ball struck her in March. Forensic pathologist Dr Nat Carey ruled out the possibility that being struck by the ball could have triggered her tragic death at an inquest in Chelmsford, Essex today. Died of natural causes: Leonie Price, 12, who collapsed and died in March after being struck by a rugby ball died of natural causes, a coroner ruled today . Teachers attempted CPR and an ambulance rushed the year seven student to nearby Basildon Hospital but she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at 12.51pm. Dr Carey said at the inquest: ‘In my opinion I do not think the strike from the ball should be viewed as a precipitating factor in her death.’ A detailed post-mortem, which included . input from heart disease experts at Great Ormond Street Hospital, . revealed Leonie had died of a ‘sudden heart rhythm disturbance’ brought . on by arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, an inherited . muscle disorder. 'Healthy little girl': The post-mortem found that Leonie was healthy but died of a 'sudden heart rhythm disturbance' Dr Carey described Leonie as a ‘healthy little girl’ who showed no sign of infection and suffered no external trauma from being hit by the ball. She suffered only minor bruising to her left eyebrow associated with her sudden collapse. He said: ‘The heart is an electrical organ. This means that people with this condition are vulnerable to sudden death and that can happen at any time.’ The inherited muscle disorder is characterised by the degeneration of the right ventricle of the heart where normal heart muscle is replaced by fat and scar tissue. It can cause abnormal electrical heart rhythms and weakening of the pumping action of the heart. Leonie’s family, including her mother Kelley Nice, partner Paul Elam and Leonie’s grandparents, sat in silence throughout the ten minute inquest. They did not wish to speak after the hearing. Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray praised the ‘commendable’ attempts of teachers at the school to administer CPR and described Leonie’s death as ‘sudden and unexpected’ before recording a verdict of death by natural causes. At school: Leonie was struck by the ball during a PE lesson at Woodlands Comprehensive School in Basildon, Essex, pictured, when she collapsed and appeared to suffer a fit in March . She said: ‘Leonie was clearly a much loved little girl with a bright future ahead of her. ‘I hope you will be able to treasure the bright and happy memories you have of her.’ At the time of Leonie's death, student Jeswin Babu, 12, described the harrowing moment she slumped to the ground in front of her classmates. He said: 'The girls said she got hit by a rugby ball and fell over and hit her head and stopped breathing. Her face started to go blue. 'We had a special assembly and they said we could ring our parents and go home early. 'Her older sister and her best friends were taken straight to hospital by the police. 'We found out she had died when her sister posted on BBM (BlackBerry Messenger).' Leonie’s death triggered a huge outpouring of grief from classmates on social networking sites when she died. Quick to help: Teachers attempted CPR before an ambulance rushed her to Basildon Hospital, pictured, where she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival . One pupil wrote: ‘RIP to our beautiful friend Leonie-Jo Nice. ‘A stunning girl that was only young, hopes to her family, we all love you, our gorgeous angel3.’ Another wrote: ‘Cant get over the fact that Leonie is gone... I grew up with her and she was such a sweet girl, £RIPLeonie. Everyone is thinking of you 3.’ Hundreds of mourners, wearing pink and black, attended Leonie’s funeral in May this year 2012. A touching family tribute read out at the service described Leonie as ‘the friendliest person you could ever meet’. It continued: ‘She loved life and her two favourite loves were music and drama. She loved prac-tising her singing in the shed, which was her secret place. ‘She was bubbly and outspoken, funny and so patient. She was just simply perfect.’ Leonie’s death came just a fortnight after 16-year-old Kyle Rees died after being hit on the head by a cricket ball at school in Bournemouth, Dorset. At least 12 young people die suddenly each week of cardiac abnormalities in the UK. The majority of young cardiac deaths are due to inherited forms of heart muscle disorder and irregular heart beat.","A coroner ruled that Leonie Price, 12, died of natural causes after she was struck by a rugby ball .

The driver of the truck Kerry Kennedy crashed into on Friday said she was either asleep at the wheel or intoxicated as he saw her 'nod off' seconds before his horn gave a warning blast. Rocco Scuitello, 47, from the Bronx area of New York, spoke about the accident and recalled how RFK's daughter's was driving erratically for more than three miles on the Westchester highway before the Lexus slammed into his rig and careered off the interstate. He told the New York Post: 'My first impression was that she was really, really drunk. She's very lucky she didn't kill somebody. Heartbroken: Ms Kennedy speaking before the funeral of her best friend and sister-in-law, Mary Richardson Kennedy, in Bedford, New York in May . 'I’ve been a truck driver for 22 years. I’m pretty sure she was half-asleep or very, very intoxicated. 'She scared the heck out of a lot of people. She was completely out of it.' He told the Post that right before the crash, he saw Kennedy's head drop down to the steering wheel before snapping up again and nodding off again, all while veering in and out of lanes. 'She started . coming at me, like she didn’t see me. She was starting to nod off, . her head was bobbing toward the steering wheel,' he said. 'I hit the horn. I couldn’t go back into . the breakdown lane because there was a disabled truck up ahead. I could . either hit that truck or let her do whatever she was going to do. 'I hit the brakes, but she hit the brakes at the same time and veered right into me. 'When she hit me, my left tire tore up . her passenger-side door. She woke up a little bit, not a lot — not the way you’d wake up if you’d just hit a 6,000-pound truck.' Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York . Kennedy, ex-wife of Governor Cuomo, was found by police slumped over her wheel of her 2008 silver-white Lexus RX 350 at one of the exits of the highway and charged with driving while ability  impaired by drugs. One of the tires on her car came free and shot into oncoming traffic and smoke was pouring out of the Lexus, the truck driver said. Mr Scuitello told the Post he first thought she must be 'really, really . drunk' and recalled when he saw her she looked like she had just rolled . out of bed. Kennedy told officers she had taken the sleeping drug Ambien before getting behind the wheel that morning. Kennedy gave blood and urine samples at a nearby police barracks, results are pending. She is expected to plead not guilty at a hearing in North Castle court tonight. On Sunday, one of Kennedy's family claimed she had had a seizure behind the wheel, which caused her to crash. They said she may be suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition which led her to black out at the wheel as she has no recollection of the collision. ‘She does not remember how she got to . the side of the road. All she remembers is feeling very woozy, and then . the cops were there,’ the source told the paper. ‘They think she may have had some sort of seizure.’ Friday's collision came just two months . after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after . struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse. Political marriage: Ms Kennedy is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left . Family: Kerry with her brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and his (now deceased) wife Mary at a gala event in 2006 . Ms Kennedy, 52, crashed into the big rig . about 8am om Friday then drove off the highway. The collision damaged . her car and left it with a flat tire. Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway. They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350. There were no passengers. She . apparently told police that she had taken prescription sleeping pills - . said to include the drug Ambien - before the accident, according to WABC. A spokesman for Ms Kennedy denied that she was under the influence. Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests – all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system. 'The charges were filed before the test results were available.' If Ms Kennedy is found to have been under the influence of Ambien, she could have a legal basis for combating the driving under the influence charge. Driving while intoxicated? Ms Kennedy says she had taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving' The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Doctors have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not criminally liable for their actions.

According to newly-released campaign finance reports, the . President has cultivated a larger and more monied group of wealthy donors for . the 2012 presidential bid than he did during his inaugural race. Those bold-faced names who write checks and host fundraisers . to convince their friends to do the same- dubbed 'bundlers' for their hefty . donations- include Marissa Mayer, the former Google executive who just recently . became the CEO of Yahoo, actress Eva Longoria who doubles as one of the . co-chairs for the re-election campaign, and the discerning editor herself. Made the cut: Anna Wintour, a large Obama donor, and her longtime partner Shelby Bryan were invited to the State Dinner at the White House when Prime Minister David Cameron came to visit in March. Ms Wintour, who is a dual citizen of the United States and . her native Britain, is the fourth-highest-grossing bundler over the past four . years, bringing in a total of $2.7million for the President and fellow . Democrats. The data comes from financial records obtained by The New . York Times, and while it portrays a varied and deep-pocketed group of funders, . they only refer to donations made up until May of this year. As a result, any . of the tens-of-millions raised over the summer and after the Democratic . National convention is not included. Wintour has lent hosted a number of fundraisers for the . President in the past few months, all of which have shown the strength of her Rolodex. In May, she co-hosted a $40,000-per-plate dinner for 50 . people in actress Sarah Jessica Parker's Manhattan townhouse. Prior to the . dinner, she even appeared in a YouTube video promoting the dinner which offered . up two raffled tickets to the event. In August, she moved her sights out of the city and . partnered up with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and his fashion designer . wife Georgina Chapman to host a $38,500-per-plate dinner in their Connecticut . home. Moving down the list of his top fundraisers, Longoria and . Mayer's names stand out given their star power.

She has made numerous campaign appearances- particularly those aimed at . attracting younger and minority voters. She even gave a speech at the . Convention stage in Charlotte, North Carolina. While the records show that Longoria only started bundling . during this campaign, Mayer's devotion to Democratic causes dates back to 2007. Over the past two years, Mayer has been responsible for . $112,400 but all told, her bundling has contributed $386,000. Increased access and prominent political appointments are . common rewards for top bundlers, and that presents a problem that President .

"By . A. Srinivasa Rao . PUBLISHED: . 15:46 EST, 1 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:46 EST, 1 April 2012 . The spectre of yet another scam, exhumed by the CBI, is back to haunt the beleaguered Congress - both in Andhra Pradesh as well as at the centre. The party was dealt a fresh blow on Saturday when the CBI named the late chief minister of the state, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in a chargesheet filed before a special court in connection with the disproportionate assets case  of his son, Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy. The investigating agency charged YSR with entering into a 'criminal conspiracy' to allot land to two pharmaceutical companies in exchange for investing in the business empire of Jagan as a quid pro quo arrangement. Probe: Jaganmohan Reddy (left) and his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, the late CM of Andhra Pradesh . This is for the first time that the CBI has included the former chief minister's name in the chargesheet. It named Jagan as accused number 1, followed by 12 other individuals and firms. However, the agency told the court that it had not considered YSR's name for prosecution as he was not alive. The direct mention of YSR has left the already besieged Congress in the state crimson- faced, because the current government is seen as a continuation of the dispensation helmed by the late party leader. Most of the ministers, who were privy to the decisions allegedly taken by YSR while making questionable land allotments, also secured berths in the Kiran Kumar Reddy government. Unsurprisingly, the YSR Congress party headed by Jagan has demanded that the CBI also prosecute these ministers, if it found fault with the YSR government's decisions. The development comes at a time when the Congress government in the state is afflicted by multiple crises. The agitation for the separate state of Telangana has brought governance to a virtual standstill in Andhra Pradesh, with MLAs as well as MPs of the Congress themselves hopping over to the side of the protesters. Under pressure: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy . Doubts have been raised about CM Kiran Kumar Reddy's leadership ever since he took charge and allegations of corruption have also been levelled often at the current Congress government. Furthermore, several party leaders are shifting loyalties to the YSR Congress. The Congress-led Union government is also neck-deep in trouble, with a spate of scams related to the Commonwealth Games, 2-G spectrum allocation, coal block allocation and army truck deals surfacing one after the other. Now, as the CBI has indicted YSR in the illegal assets case of Jagan, one of the Congress's two citadels in the South (the other being Kerala) looks all set to crumble. The party's leaders in the state are trying to wash their hands off the matter by peddling the argument that they could not be held responsible for the acts of omission and commission made by YSR during his regime. 'The state's cabinet does have collective responsibility, but the ministers are not responsible for surreptitiously struck deals,' PCC president Botsa Satyanarayana, who was a key member of the YSR cabinet, claimed. State BJP president G. Kishan Reddy, however, rejected the defence put up by Satyanarayana: 'Till his death, YSR was a Congressman. So, the party has to pay the penalty for whatever decisions he had taken,' he said. Prime accused Jagan's likely arrest in the case is also giving the Congress sleepless nights. Sources in the party revealed that the CBI may not arrest YSR's son till the completion of bypolls to 18 assembly seats in the state in June. This was because the ruling party was apprehensive that Jagan's incarceration at this stage would trigger a serious law and order problem in the state, and there was every possibility of the sympathy factor working in his favour during the byelections. Significantly, if Jagan's party wins all the 18 seats, Congress leaders could shift en masse to his camp. In paragraph 69 of the chargesheet, the CBI said investigations had revealed that in 2006, K. Nityananda Reddy, MD of Aurobindo Pharma Limited, and Hetero Group of Companies director M. Srinivas Reddy had hatched a criminal conspiracy with YSR as well as senior IAS official B.P. Acharya. The latter, who was then the MD of the AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, and YSR allegedly colluded to allot 75 acres of land at the Pharma Special Economic Zone at Jadcherla in Mahabubnagar district to the two industry head honchos without in violation of rules. Mail Today has a copy of the chargesheet filed by the CBI . The CBI disclosed that land was allotted at `7 lakh per acre, which was well below the fixed rate, thereby giving a benefit of `17.20 crore to the two pharma companies. As a quid pro quo, Aurobindo - through the relatives of Nityananda Reddy - invested `3 crore in Jagati Publications. Hetero and its director had pumped in `4.5 crore into Jagati and `15 crore into Janani Infrastructure, promoted by Jaganmohan Reddy. The CBI pointed out that APIIC chief general manager (projects) T.L. Ramachandran had rejected the file sent by Acharya recommending the allotment of land, stating that the deal could not be struck at just `7 lakh per acre. Yet Acharya had ordered that the corporation give the 'inprinciple letter of allocation' to the two companies at the same rate citing an approval from YSR. Acharya got the clearance papers signed by YSR who had, in turn, personally handed them over to the pharma company representatives, the CBI alleged. Intriguingly, the entire exercise was completed in a day. The CBI also found fault with the YSR government for letting Aurobindo transfer 30.33 acres out of the land allotted to it at Pasamylaram industrial estate at Patancheru in Medak district to another company, Trident Life Sciences Limited. 'Jaganmohan, in league with his father YSR, Acharya and APIIC official YVL Prasad entered into the nefarious deal of allotting land to Aurobindo and Hetero at Jadcherla SEZ by violating norms. Other group companies joined the conspiracy and are, therefore, liable for prosecution,' the CBI chargesheet said. The CBI authorities said these were just a few companies that had benefited from dealing with YSR. In an apparent damage-control exercise, state cabinet minister S. Sailaja Nath said the Kiran Kumar Reddy government would take back the land allotted to certain companies by YSR. The CBI has been investigating the case following a high court order in August 2011, based on a petition filed by former state minister P. Shankar Rao, who had alleged Jagan had amassed wealth to the tune of `43,000 crore during the regime of his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy between 2004 and 2009. The business empire of Jagan began with taking over of SPCL in 2001 from its original promoter M.B.Ghorpade with an initial paid up capital of `53.51 crore. In 2005, Jagan brought in `124.60 crore investments into SPCL from two Mauritiusbased companies - 2i Capital and Pluri Emerging Company. The CBI report says Jagan's auditor V. Vijay Sai Reddy had manipulated the valuation reports of Carmel Asia and Jagathi Publications to jack up their values to enable them sell the shares to several high profile investors and companies at a premium of `350 per share. Jagan had allegedly created fictitious transactions of selling 82 lakh shares of SPCL at `18.75 each to five companies - Sai Surya Warehousing Company limited, Excel Prosoft Limited, Sigma. Jagan had allegedly diverted the funds from the SPCL to float four subsidiary companies - Carmel Asia Holdings Pvt Ltd, Silicon Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, Krishna Power Technologies Ltd and Bhagavat Sannidhi Estates Pvt Ltd. Several companies such as Indu Projects, Ramky Infra, Pioneer Infra, Aurobindo Pharma, Lanco and individuals such as Nimmagadda Prasad had invested in Jagan's media house.",Congress worries mount as 18 assembly bypolls approach .

Luis Walker, sentenced to 20 years in prison in July after being convicted of raping one female recruit and sexually assaulting several others. Walker, a married father with two . boys, was found guilty on all 28 charges faced with prosecutors claiming . that he had sexual intercourse with four of 10 female recruits. He faced life in prison.

American children eat as much salt as adults — about 1,000 milligrams too much, or the same amount as in just one Big Mac – with its effects in some cases tripling children’s blood pressure rates. While extra salt is already linked with higher blood pressure, even in kids, government research says those who are overweight and obese may be the most vulnerable to its effects, according to the new findings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previous research has shown similar results in adults but studies on salt, weight and blood pressure are scarce in children, the research published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday revealed. Consumption: The recommended daily salt or sodium intake for kids and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon daily, or about 2,300 milligrams though on average, kids were found consuming 3,300 milligrams daily . The CDC researchers looked at data on 6,200 kids aged 8 to 18 involved in 2003-08 national health surveys. The children were asked twice over several days to detail all foods they'd eaten the previous day; the researchers calculated salt intake from their answers. Overall, 15 per cent had either high blood pressure or slightly elevated blood pressure called prehypertension. Those who ate the most salt faced double the risk of having elevated blood pressure, compared with those who ate few salty foods showing that for every 1,000 mg of extra sodium in the children's diets, a one-point increase in blood pressure was found. Among overweight or obese kids, the risk was more than triple, showing that for 1,000 mg of sodium consumed, there was a blood pressure increase of 1.5 points. The recommended daily salt or sodium . intake for kids and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon daily, or about . 2,300 milligrams. On average, study kids ate 3,300 milligrams daily. According to previous data from the CDC, . U.S. adults consume 3,466 mg of sodium per day by comparison. Too much: Children were found eating about 1,000 milligrams too much of salt daily, equaling the same amount as in just one Big Mac (pictured) CDC . researcher Quanhe Yang says it's unclear why heavier kids would be more . sensitive to salt but it could be due to obesity-related hormone . changes. The results raise concerns because studies have shown that elevated blood pressure in childhood, even just prehypertension, can lead to full-fledged high blood pressure in adulthood and potentially premature heart disease. 'We shouldn't underestimate the potential harms of a 1-mm increase in systolic blood pressure,' said Dr. Frederick Kaskel, chief of pediatric nephrology at Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York who was involved in the research. 'The antecedents of adult cardiovascular disease are seen early on in the pediatric age group.' Prehypertension and high blood pressure in children younger than 17 depend on age, height and gender. In those 18 and up, readings between 120 over 80 and 140 over 90 are prehypertension; 140 over 90 and higher is high blood pressure. While health authorities across the globe warn consumers to cut back on dietary salt, a number of recent studies have suggested that not getting enough salt can be as harmful as getting too much. Getting a rise: For every 1,000 mg of extra sodium in children's diets, a one-point increase in blood pressure was found while for overweight or obese children there was a blood pressure increase of 1.5 points . The salt industry has pounced on that research, saying the dietary guidelines for sodium intake are flawed and should be withdrawn. Dr. Michael Alderman of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York cautioned that it's not clear that cutting back on sodium will do most kids any good. 'There is nothing in this paper - and there is no information that I'm familiar with - that suggests reducing sodium intake is of value for people eating an average of 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day,' he told Reuters Health. Alderman said he has been an adviser to the Salt Institute, which represents the industry, and received $750 from the group in 1995. He said he has no ties to the group today. Graf said bread is the biggest source of dietary sodium in the U.S., adding that deli meats also contain a lot of the ingredient. Eating a healthy diet - including whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and fresh fish and meats - will automatically reduce sodium intake, she noted.","Children were found consuming 1,000 milligrams too much according to study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

Thousands of striking Chicago teachers will keep striking until at least Tuesday, union delegates said, shutting off schools to students until Wednesday at the earliest, despite threats from the mayor to take them to court.

Teachers and their allies packed a city park Saturday in a boisterous show of force as union leaders and the district tried to work out the details of an agreement that could end a week-long walkout. Pushing strollers, toting signs and towing wagons of children, thousands of red-shirted teachers cheered and chanted as speaker after speaker urged them to stand firm until they have a deal in writing. They told the teachers that their strike was a symbol of hope for public teachers and other unions that have been losing ground around the nation. 'I'm pretty confident that something . will come together that both sides will agree on,' said Ramses James, a . sixth-grade math teacher. 'I believe this is a very strong turning point . when you have so many people coming out to fight alongside (the . teachers union). That means a lot.' Months of contract negotiations came . down to two main issues: job security and union opposition to a new . teacher evaluation process the union felt was too heavily weighted on . student test scores.

Addressing demonstrators Saturday, Lewis cautioned that 'we are on strike' and that classes won't resume until the delegates see an agreement they can support. The Rev. Jesse Jackson also addressed the crowd, saying the strike was a 'struggle for working people everywhere' and that there was still a long road to ensuring all residents of the city have equal access to quality schools, especially in neighborhoods beset by gang violence and poverty.

Walker's administration immediately vowed to appeal, while unions, which have vigorously fought the law, declared victory. 'People are energized by this,' said Marty Horning a high school social studies teacher from Milwaukee who came to the rally with a busload of others. 'I think that the line has to be drawn in terms of teacher bashing, union bashing and privatization of education. These forces and factors are not just in Chicago, not just in Wisconsin, but across the nation and (Chicago) happens to be the spear point.' Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has blasted the union for engaging in a 'strike of choice,' sounded optimistic Friday, saying 'the tentative framework is an honest and principled compromise that is about who we all work for: the students.' The walkout in the nation's third-largest school district canceled five days of class for more than 350,000 public school students who had just returned from summer vacation. Until this week, Chicago teachers had not walked out since 1987, when they were on strike for 19 days.","Mayor Rahm Emanuel threatens to take Chicago teachers to court over 'illegal' strike action .

A British man had an ear, two fingers and three toes chopped off during an horrific 13-day kidnap ordeal over an alleged £10,000 drug debt, a court has heard. James Ross, 28, was allegedly tortured in a secluded villa in Portugal's Algarve by a gang of five fellow Britons in May 2010. The former postman was also sodomised with an iron bar, had one of his testicles severed and his tendons slashed - before they tried to murder him by driving a car he was in into a reservoir. The defendants, including William Quinn, 54, and Calum Macleod, 45, of the Western Isles, all deny the charges. Manchester-based Steve Johnson, also known as John Maclean, 48, Terence McGurk, 33, and Ronnie Rose, 25, from the Midlands, are also on trial. Witness Carlos Pereira told the opening day of the trial at Loule Court how he found Mr Ross, of Caithness, Scotland, in the street 'bloodstained and missing an ear and a finger'. He said he looked like a 'car crash victim' as he walked 'with difficulty' and 'with his arms in the air'. Loule Court's prosecution said Mr Ross was lured to the Algarve in October 2010 with the promise of a job growing cannabis to pay off a £10,000 drug-trafficking debt. Accused: Calum Macleod (left) and William Quinn (right) are part of the five man gang standing trial .

He was then, it is alleged, brutally . tortured for 13 days before escaping his captors in the village of . Colinquelme, near the town of Loule, on October 18. He was found bleeding in the street in the nearby village of Alfontes by Mr Pereira, who told the court he lived near the villa where Mr Ross was allegedly held captive. He said he knew the accused and had seen many people coming in and out of the house, where sports cars were frequently also seen. Accused: Terence McGurk (left), Ronnie Rose (centre) and Steven Johnson (right) before the trial . Johnson,  accused of being the mastermind of the kidnapping and of luring Mr Ross to Portugal, faces two additional charges alleging illegal possession of a gun and ammunition.

The backlash against boardroom greed spread from Britain’s banks to the rest of the City yesterday as ordinary shareholders rose up against fat cat pay deals. Bosses at insurance giant Aviva were left humiliated after their multi-million pound bonuses were rejected by investors at their annual meeting. And last night Sly Bailey, chief executive . of Trinity Mirror newspaper group, was forced out after weeks of . criticism from investors and shareholders about her £1.7million pay . package. Yesterday’s outpouring of anger at the lavish pay packages afforded to Aviva executives follows a string of embarrassing rebukes against other firms. Anger: Barclays' chief Bob Diamond's pay jackpot this year has ignited a furious battle with investors, while Trinity Mirror boss Sly Bailey, right, was forced out after weeks of criticism from shareholders . Last week, Barclays also received a bloody nose, with 31.4 per cent of shareholders failing to back its pay and perks. This included a package of up to £26.6million for its chief executive Bob Diamond. On Tuesday, mining giant Xstrata received a protest vote of 39 per cent over its remuneration report, which sanctioned a package worth £6million for its boss Mick Davis. But the Aviva result – described as symptomatic of a ‘tsunami of revulsion’ against fat cat pay – meant the Norwich-based firm became the first blue chip company to receive a majority ‘No’ vote from shareholders over its pay and perks since the credit crunch. Aviva chairman Lord Sharman was also lambasted by one shareholder for failing to sack chief executive Andrew Moss after revelations emerged in 2009 of an office affair. Last night Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Commission, said: ‘The rebellion is spreading from the banks to other businesses. ‘Shareholders are finally taking more of a . stand and waking up to the fact they have been ripped off. This is a . result of the economic times we’re living in. Storm: Earlier this week mining giant Xstrata received a protest vote of 39 per cent over its remuneration report, which sanctioned a package worth £6million for its boss Mick Davis . ‘Businesses just can’t afford to look like they’re living on a different planet from the rest of us.’ Aviva has been dragged into the firing line after dishing out pay packages worth up to £5.2million to its chief executive Andrew Moss and £4.2million for his Australian right-hand man Trevor Matthews, who only joined the firm in December. This included a ‘controversial’ £2.5million ‘golden hello’ payment. Almost 60 per cent of votes failed to back the insurer’s remuneration report, which sanctioned the payments. Some 54 per cent – which came from private shareholders and giant pension funds – actively protested against the insurer’s multi-million pound bonuses. Aviva, which has 14million customers in the UK after swallowing up Norwich Union, joined the ranks of state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland and oil giant Shell which both faced rebellions at the height of the financial crisis in 2009. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat peer . who has campaigned against excessive pay in the City, said the move . showed the need for government reforms which will give shareholders . formal power to stop excessive pay deals. Currently, companies can . ignore shareholders’ pleas for restraint. But Lord Oakeshott added: ‘A tsunami of shareholder anger is now hitting overpaid and underperforming big businesses. Although Barclays boss Bob Diamond is “Mr Greedy” personified, the revolt is rightly going wider.’ The humiliation at Aviva comes despite repeated attempts to head off a rebellion, including promises of pay reform and Moss waiving a 4.8 per cent pay rise that would have nudged his salary above £1million. The issue of bonuses at Aviva has become particularly toxic as its shares have slumped by more than a fifth. Mounting resentment finally spilled over at London’s Barbican arts centre as the firm jousted with shareholders at its annual meeting. Ordinary investors in the audience, many of them pensioners, ripped into the spiralling pay enjoyed by Aviva’s top brass. One private shareholder also questioned the morality of the company’s boardroom, referring to revelations of Mr Moss’s affair. Addressing the chairman, Lord Sharman, who backed Mr Moss over the scandal, Michael Mason-Mahon said: ‘Your failure to deal with this brings shame on you.’ Another shareholder, Philip Meadowcraft, said: ‘Our board members are more concerned about their own remuneration than growing the business.’ Aviva has pledged to review its bonus scheme, but its executives will not lose their bonuses despite the vote as it is not binding on the company. Lord Oakeshott added: ‘Business Secretary Vince Cable’s proposals for binding shareholder votes on top pay packages must now be passed into law to stop shareholders who own our companies from just being toothless tigers.’ Last night Chris Leslie, Shadow Treasury minister said: ‘Shareholders are properly beginning to exercise their powers on our behalf. ‘Senior executives need to recognise the ordinary households who are having to tighten their belts in the recession.’","Anger towards Aviva follows several other rebukes against other firms .

When Liz Crowter put pictures of her vivacious daughter on a Down’s syndrome support group’s website, she had hoped to show others how those with the condition were ‘just like you and me’. But her efforts have backfired after internet ‘trolls’ stole the family snaps of Heidi, now 16, from the site – and published them on mocking Facebook pages. One of the pages was illustrated with pictures of Heidi as a toddler and joked about losing ‘your virginity to a retard’. Web taunts: Heidi Crowter, 16, who was taunted online is pictured here with her mother Liz. Heidi is holding her laptop which shows a picture of her with an offensive remark . Another was called: ‘Your milkshake [body] brings all the tards to the yard’ – a twisted reference to a popular song. Mrs Crowter, who has three other children, said: ‘It makes me sad and angry that people don’t see it as wrong to be so hurtful. ‘They simply cannot have had the pleasure of meeting anyone with Down’s, otherwise they would realise they are warm human beings like anyone else.’ She added: ‘There have been other cases of trolls ending up in court and I’d like to see these trolls face the same punishment if possible.’ Targeted by tormenters: Heidi Crowter who was mocked after images were stolen from the Coventry and Rugby Down's Syndrome Support group website . The images had been stolen from the . Coventry and Rugby Down’s Syndrome Support group website, which Mrs . Crowter ran for five years until 2009. Web taunts: Mrs Crowter complained to police about the vile taunts - but they weren't interested in investigating . She and her husband Steve, 43, discovered the first mocking page online last September and it has since been taken down. But earlier this month, the couple, . who run a car dealership, became aware of the ‘milkshake’ page and a . third, also on Facebook. ‘I feel violated and violated on Heidi’s behalf…It’s not just Heidi, it’s photos of other people’s children as well,’ Mrs Crowter added. Despite repeatedly reporting the trolls, the couple say Facebook has made no direct contact with them. Although Heidi’s picture has now been removed from the second page, the third remains online and contains at least 13 images of her. Mrs Crowter, from Coventry, said she had contacted West Midlands Police, but said she was told that it was not a matter for officers. Down’s syndrome is a genetic condition caused by an extra chromosome in a baby’s cells. In the UK, around one baby in every 1,000 is born with it. Mrs Crowter said Heidi was a ‘very independent young lady’, who was studying for her GCSEs at a mainstream school and doing a hairdressing course.

Accused: Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, seen voting in the first round of the 2012 French presidential elections, told magistrates swinging parties were about having free and consensual sex . Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has claimed it is 'normal' for him to have sex with six different women at orgies. The 63-year-old economist, accused of knowingly using vice girls in an alleged prostitution ring, also told magistrates his young conquests were not call girls and that he often had sex with women in their 20s. The man once tipped as the next French president, gave the extraordinary explanation to magistrates probing claims he used £800-a-night prostitutes at swingers' parties. He has been charged with conspiring with pimps and of knowing fraudulently obtained money was being paid to the vice girls by the racket based in Lille, northern France. In a hearing from March, the transcript of which has only been published today, a magistrate asks Mr Strauss-Khan: 'Bearing in mind the high number of girls, their age and their behaviour, do you maintain you did not know they were prostitutes?' 'I counted that there were six girls in total,' Mr Strauss-Khan replied. 'That does not seem to me to be a considerable number.' The magistrate went on: 'Do think that if they had not been paid, they would not have agreed to have sex with you on so many occasions, considering the age difference between you?' Mr Strauss-Kahn answered: 'Numerous young women with whom I've had sexual exchanges - no, that's the wrong word - sexual relations, had the same age difference.' The world's former top banker went on to explain: 'Swinging parties are about having free and consensual sex. Think what you like about it on a moral level, but no one was being paid.' The 62-year-old has openly confessed to attending swingers parties in France and Belgium, but said he never knew the girls were prostitutes because 'they were all naked at the time'. His lawyer, Henri Leclerc, said: 'At these parties, people were not dressed, and I defy you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and any other naked woman.' But Mr Strauss-Kahn's claims come after five French and Belgian vice girls told police they were paid to have sex with the former bank chief. One girl told detectives she attended 11 orgies with him over six years and added in her statement: 'I got the feeling he liked rough sex.' Coming out of the woodwork: Five French and Belgian vice girls have told police they were paid to have sex with the former bank chief, seen here with his wife Anne Sinclair during a bail hearing in New York last year . Scandal: Last year Mr Strauss-Khan was charged with raping a maid at the Sofitel Hotel in New York. The charges were later dropped . Another prostitute named Marion, 30, also told investigators it was 'rare to find men who showed as little respect for girls' as Mr Strauss-Khan. She added: 'It was just pure sexual consumption, and these sessions often became bestial and violent.' Mr Strauss-Kahn has been embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals since he was accused of raping a hotel chambermaid in an upmarket New York hotel in May last year. After being held in New York's notorious Ryker's Island prison, criminal charges were dropped and he returned to France only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer. When those allegations were also dropped, he was then confronted with more claims he used prostitutes supplied by the Lille vice network. Police also uncovered texts sent . between Mr Strauss-Kahn and men accused of hiring prostitutes for him, . in which the economist referred to girls as 'equipment' and 'bits of . stuff' as he arranged sex sessions around the world. His lawyer Richard Malka has described him as a 'simple swinger' who committed nothing more than a 'crime of lust'. Mr . Malka said he and his client would now do everything in their power to . have the charges brought by two judges in Lille dismissed. He . said: 'It is quite implausible and contrary to common sense to use . terms like ""organised gang"" and ""vice network"" to describe a simple . swinging activity. 'Mr Strauss-Kahn is finding himself, in large part because of his fame, thrown to the wolves. And what a strange coincidence that all this should happen a month from a major national election.' Coincidence? Mr Strauss-Khan's lawyer Richard Malka, said it was a 'strange coincidence' that his client should be going through the case a month from a major national election now between Nicolas Sarkozy (pictured) and François Hollande . Mr Strauss-Kahn had been widely tipped to stand as the socialist candidate in this month's presidential election, with polls showing he would easily have beaten right-wing rival Nicolas Sarkozy. This week he accused Britain's Guardian newspaper of fabricating an 'interview' in which he is quoted as saying Sarkozy conspired to wreck his bid for the presidency. While a furious Sarkozy threatened to sue, Mr Strauss-Kahn said the interview was simply a 'montage' of old quotes. Mr Strauss-Kahn is now formally under 'judicial control' on £85,000 bail until judges decide whether to send him to stand trial, which means he cannot leave France and has to report to police regularly.","Strauss-Khan charged with conspiring with pimps and knowing fraudulently obtained money used to pay vice girls .

Police were on duty to make sure EDL demonstrators did not enter the Bury Park area of Luton, where most of the town's 30,000 Muslim population live. They also were there to prevent any Muslims attacking the EDL. The EDL has held demonstrations across the country since it was formed in Luton in March 2009 as a response to Muslim radicals, who disrupted a home-coming parade by the Royal Anglian Regiment.

The . number of men doing part-time work because they cannot find a full-time . job has more than doubled in the last four years, according to a new study. The . Trade Union Congress (TUC) said almost 600,000 men were working part-time in December while . looking for full-time positions, compared to 293,000 at the end of 2007. Latest . official figures have shown that 1.4 million workers and self-employed . people work part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, the . highest figure since records began in 1992. A TUC graph shows that the East of England has the highest percentage rise of involuntary part-time workers . The number of people settling for part-time positions has sky-rocketed with the highest number of disgruntled workers based in London . People living in the . east of England have been hit by the biggest increase in . under-employment over the past four years, with the number of men . “trapped” in part-time jobs more than trebling to almost 60,000, said . the TUC. Its analysis of official figures showed that the North East, . Northern Ireland and London also experienced sharp rises in involuntary . part-time work. The report, published ahead of the latest . unemployment figures tomorrow, also revealed that the number of women . working in involuntary part-time jobs has more than doubled in London . and Northern Ireland over the past four years. More employees in Britain have been forced to work part-time than anywhere else in Europe - according to figures released by the European Union. Unemployment fell by 35,000 to 2.65million between December and February this year - the first quarterly since last spring. But experts suggest that this fall was fueled by the rise in part-time workers. There are 1.77million Britons classed as ‘underemployed’, which means they want to work longer hours but cannot find any available jobs. As a result, these workers said they had no choice but to take a part-time job despite needing the money from a full-time job or extra shifts. The average worker with a full-time job is paid an annual salary of £26,000 while a part time worker gets only £8,000 on average. TUC general secretary . Brendan Barber said: “Last month’s fall in unemployment was a welcome . surprise. No-one should be under any illusion however that the jobs . crisis is over. “Virtually all employment growth is coming from . part-time and temporary jobs but most of the people taking them want and . need permanent, full-time work. “Any job may be better than no job . at all but people are having to make huge salary sacrifices to stay . working. This is bad news for family finances and it is holding back our . economy. “Any hope of an economic recovery that benefits everyone . rests on the growth of well-paid, skilled, full-time jobs. It is the . only way for people to increase their incomes and get back to working to . the best of their ability. “Proper jobs growth, rather than . self-defeating austerity and making work even more insecure by attacking . basic employment rights, must be the Government’s top priority.” Areas . of the UK with the most people doing part-time work because they cannot . find full-time jobs include London (198,000), the North West (152,000), . the South East (141,000) and the West Midlands (132,000), said the TUC. Last month it was revealed that . overall unemployment has fallen for the first time in almost a year. But that still leaves 2.65 million people out of work. The total dipped by 35,000 in the three months to the end of February, giving a jobless rate of 8.3 per cent. Employment minister Chris Grayling said the figures were a 'step in the right direction'. Trapped: Men are are struggling to find full time employment . But as Britain fears a double dip-recession its wealthiest 1,000 people became even richer over the past year. Bucking the economic downturn the super-rich have so far enjoyed a great 2012, with the combined wealth of the richest 1,000 now standing at a record £414.26 billion, up 4.7 per cent. The previous high of £412.85 billion in 2008 was set months before the financial crash from which the rest of Britain has yet to fully recover.","Official figures show that 1.4million men are taking on shifts and casual work because they cannot find a full-time job .

A Swiss politician has been accused of advertising for cannibals to kill and eat the mother and daughter of a policeman friend going through a ‘tricky’ divorce. Hans Ulrich Rudel, a convicted murderer, allegedly sought a ‘sadistic master or butcher who can educate us mindless creatures.’ Rudel, 53, is said to have placed the German language ad in the names of his best friend's wife, Patricia Joachim, 27, and her 12-year-old daughter. 'Marquis el Diablo': Hans Ulrich Rudel, who is known for specialising spankings, is accused of trying to procure a cannibal . It added: ‘We are keen to meet gentlemen interested in slaughter and dolce who would like to roast us on a spit.’ Rudel, a founder of a local . conservative party, later told police that ‘dolce’ – the Italian word . for ‘sweet’ - was his term for cannibalism. Previously, . he had served a decade in jail for the ritualistic killing of a young . woman in 1988 - he shot her and then impaled her body on a tree branch. Both . he and Joachim – his co-founder of a branch of the Swiss conservative . party BDP in Embrachertal - were members of a sado-masochistic club. Rudel, . who worked in the town planning office, was known as ‘Marquis el . Diablo’ who specialised in spanking, whippings and ‘hot wax’ torture. Rudel, . who goes on trial tomorrow, told police after his arrest in 2010 that . he posted the ad in the hope that someone ‘would get the wife out of the . way.’ Hiding sinster activity?

Some two dozen people responded to the small ad on the Internet, one offering a ‘special dungeon’ on his farm that he could use. Another described himself as an ‘ideal and very experienced master butcher.’ Rudel chose him for his macabre scheme and replied, enclosing photos of the would-be victims.

The former lover of a millionaire businessman has inherited Britain's largest cemetery after she spent six years locked in a vicious court battle with his children. Diane Holliday, 50, is now the owner of Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey, after the High Court ruled she is entitled to a share of Ramadan Guney's fortune, which she claims is worth £28million. She said that, because she was in a relationship with the rich Turkish Cypriot for eight years and had a son with him, she is entitled to 'reasonable provision' from his estate. But after he died aged 74 in 2006 his six grown children were adamant that she did not deserve a penny of his wealth. The ensuing court dispute with Miss Holliday - who once claimed to have given birth to the lovechild of Dodi Fayed - grew increasingly bitter. At one point one of Mr Guney's sons was even charged with taking out a hit on Miss Holliday - though he was later cleared at the Old Bailey. The family insisted Mr Guney could not be the father of Miss Holliday's 12-year-old son as he had had a vasectomy 30 years before the boy's birth, but it was never proved that the child was not his. And in 2008 the siblings said they believed that the cemetery owner had been murdered and decided to have his body exhumed. Now, the Daily Telegraph reports, the High Court has ruled Miss Holliday should receive £60,000 a year for her and her son Houssein. The cemetery was said to be worth between £700,000 and £1.2million and could bring in more if Miss Holliday runs it as a business. Feud: The death of Ramadan Guney (left) triggered a legal battle that escalated to the point that his son Erkin (right) was accused of taking out a hit on Miss Holliday . Judge Lindsey Kushner QC said in a written judgment that the Guney children's behaviour during the case had been 'despicable'. In . 1998 Ms Holliday, who was once labelled a 'gold-digger' during another . court case, claimed Dodi Fayed was the father of her daughter - a year . after he was killed in a car crash alongside Princess Diana. Mohammed Fayed always maintained his son never  had a baby with Miss Holliday, and proof of the child's paternity has never been made public. She said she had DNA test results that proved who the father was, but that these had been stolen from her car when she was attacked by a knifeman at a service station. Miss Holliday was arrested on suspicion of wasting police time, but was later cleared of faking the assault. Paternity claim: Miss Holliday said Dodi Fayed fathered her daughter shortly before his death . It is understood she met Mr Guney at Dodi Fayed's funeral, which was held at the burial ground she now owns. He died of an apparent heart attack in November 2006, in Northern Cyprus. His children's lawyer said in an earlier hearing that Mr Guney had had a number of girlfriends in his home country and died in the arms of one of them. Miss Holliday won the right to make an inheritance bid at the Court of Appeal in 2010, after settling a crucial dispute over where Mr Guney was had been domiciled. A judge dismissed the Guneys' claim that, since their father had been living in Northern Cyprus when he died, English courts had no power to award anything to the widow. Judge Kushner handed Miss Holliday a crucial victory when she . ruled that Mr Guney’s emotional attachment to the cemetery, which he . bought in 1985, his choice of burial place and his love for their son, . meant he had made England his home. As well as Brookwood Cemetery, she won part proceeds from the sale of another property and will keep the home she shared with Mr Guney. It will be decided in July whether his children will be allowed to appeal the High court's latest decision. They have already been awarded 130 properties in Cyprus, in addition to other assets. The most recent ruling signals that there may be an end in sight to an incredibly long and expensive legal battle. One of Mr Guney's daughters, Gulon, said that by March 2010 she and her siblings had already spent about £500,000 in legal costs.","Diane Holliday has been awarded ownership of Britain's biggest cemetery after bid for Ramadan Guney's assets .

Mr Davis's brother John Davis said he was in critical condition after this morning's accident, with a broken rib, punctured lung and burns on his legs and side. John Davis, who like his brother works in construction, said: 'In our trade we stick together. It’s a serious business. You’ll die out there.

Fire officials said Mr Davis, 44, fell through the weakened part of the roof into a tank of acid used for cleaning steel. Nitric acid is a strong acid and a powerful oxidising agent, which can cause chemical burns as it decomposes animal muscle. Concentrated . nitric acid attacks tissues readily and stains human skin yellow when . it reacts with the keratin. The stains turn orange when neutralised.

A beautiful pop singer who defied the Taliban's decree against music and dancing was shot dead after she left a beauty salon last night. Pakistani star Ghazala Javed, 24, was shot after a motorcyclist opened fire on a car she was in with her father, who was also killed. Police said that one of the suspects is her ex-husband, who she reportedly asked for a divorce after finding out he had at least one other wife. Her demand was a highly unusual one for a deeply conservative and male-dominated society where many consider a woman asking for divorce a dishonour to the husband. Ms Javed, who was popular with young, progressive ethnic Pashtuns in northwest Pakistan, was reportedly driving home with her father when a motorcycle raced towards their car and opened fire. She was hit with six bullets and and pronounced dead along with her father at a hospital in Peshawar, according to CNN. In recent years the rise of the Pakistani Taliban, who disagree with singing and dancing, made it difficult for Ms Javed and other artists to perform and record songs in the country.

Rampage: John Richards was jailed for smashing up a 103-inch TV, worth up to £45,000, in Britain's 'best sports pub' A hammer-wielding businessman has been jailed for smashing up a £45,000 TV in Britain's 'best sports pub' as customers prepared to watch one of the key matches of the football season. John Richards destroyed the 103-inch flat-screen set during a drunken rampage in which he also hit a customer on the head, damaged a cheaper TV, smashed a window, and made a hole in a wall. When police arrested him and asked how drunk he had been on a scale of one to 10, the 44-year-old replied: ‘12.’ Richards, who runs a computing recycling firm, had spent the day drinking after collecting post from his former business premises near the Globe pub, in Chichester, West Sussex. But as he walked past the pub at about 6.15pm he thought the manager was laughing at him, Chichester Crown Court heard. He then returned to his old office to collect a hammer before heading to the pub 'intent' on causing damage. The pub, which was named National Sports Pub of the Year at the Great British Pub Awards 2011, was filling up with customers when the attack happened on April 18. They had gathered to watch Chelsea beat Barcelona 1-0 in a tense Champions League semi-final clash. Richards had previously been barred from the pub, but his ban expired only a week before the incident. Prosecutor Nicola Fleck said: 'Mr Richards had previously been in some trouble with the pub and had been banned for 18 months. 'When the pub manager, Roger Nessling, saw him in the pub he asked him why he was there. Smashed: Cracks stretch from the point on the TV screen where a drunken Richards used his hammer . Cracked: Richards told police that he could not remember putting his hammer through the television screen . 'After being spoken to, Mr Richards walked towards a 103-inch wall-mounted television with a hammer in his hand and smashed it.' Ms Fleck said that Richards began swearing and added: ‘I will do six months for this but I will shut the pub down in three.’ The prosecutor said: 'The television is one of only 10 of its size in the country and is worth between £35,000 and £45,000. 'He then approached a smaller TV which was broken with a hammer. Remedy: Pub staff covered the damaged plasma TV with a white sheet so it can be used as a projection screen . Destruction: The window of a door in the pub is boarded up after being smashed in a hammer blow . 'He continued to abuse Mr Nessling and most concerning, he said he was going to be killed.'As Richards left the pub, he prodded the hammer into the back of customer Kevin Church's head, the court heard. Richards told Mr Church, who was at the bar: ‘If I see you drinking in here again I will kill you’. Ms Fleck said: 'That caused a lump and some discomfort for Mr Church. 'Mr Church said it was completely unprovoked, he had looked away to avoid trouble and was scared. 'Mr Nessling said he was fearful for his staff and customers’ safety. 'In police interview Mr Richards admitted the criminal damage but said he did not remember the assault.' Hole: The pub's smaller wall-mounted television, which was also damaged by Richards in his drunken state . Police showed Richards CCTV of the incident and he accepted it was him. 'He said on a scale of drunkeness of one to ten, he was a 12,' Ms Flack said. 'He added that Mr Nessling had been laughing at him and he was provoked.' He told a probation officer there was a history of animosity between him and Mr Nessling and he went into the pub because he thought Mr Nessling had laughed and 'made facial expressions' when he passed by, the court heard. Shocked: Pub landlady Sharon Chittock said customers were 'frozen stiff with fear' He went to the pub with the hammer because he thought Mr Nessling had been laughing at him and 'making facial expressions' as he passed by that afternoon, the court heard. Emek Yagmur, defending, said Richards was 'remorseful'. She added: 'He realises it what he did was extremely stupid and he let himself down. He lost his temper. 'He should be given credit for his very early guilty plea at the police station.' Jailing Richards for a total of six months, Judge Claudia Ackner described the rampage as an 'extremely frightening episode' with 'gratuitous damage'. She added: 'It was fortunate Mr Church did not suffer more serious damage during your unprovoked attack on him.' Richards, from Fishbourne, West Sussex, admitted four counts of criminal damage and one charge of assault by beating. The hammer was forfeited and Richards was banned from licensed premises for two years. Speaking before the case came to court, the pub's landlady, Sharon Chittock, 40, said: 'Our customers and staff were frozen stiff with fear when he pulled the hammer out from his sleeve. 'There was no stopping or reasoning with him as he just smashed it once straight through the screen. The TV was destroyed. 'We were starting to get busy and the atmosphere was building ahead of the Chelsea game. 'We were left with a lot of disappointed customers who had to crowd around a smaller screen to watch the game instead.'

The armed man burst into the Cotton Tree pub, in the city's Droylsden district, shortly before 11.50pm last night and shot dead a 23-year-old man, named by sources as Mark Short. Three people wounded, believed to be related to Mr Short , have been taken to hospital where their condition is not thought to be life-threatening, Greater Manchester Police said. Crime scene: Police outside the Cotton Tree pub in Manchester, where a gunman opened fire . Speaking from the scene, Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley said a man burst into the private party and opened fire on a group of men around the pool table. 'We don't believe this to be a random attack, although we are not clear about who the intended victim was,' he said. 'We understand this was a family occasion and that a lone gunman walked into the premises and opened fire on a group of males stood by the pool table.' Between 20 and 30 people, aged 18-65, were said to be in the pub at the time. Mr Adderley said officers were keeping an open mind about the motive but said all the victims were known to the police. Two of the wounded men, aged 25 and 26, were shot in the leg and a 29-year-old man was shot in his lower back. They are in hospital but their injuries are not believed to be life threatening. Murder inquiry: Forensics officers enter the scene where one man was shot dead and three others wounded . The gunman, who was wearing a balaclava, escaped in a Ford Focus, found abandoned and alight in Hattersley soon after.

The wife of Jerry Sandusky defended her husband on the stand during the sixth day of his child sex abuse trial, saying that she remembers most of his accusers, and never witnessed them having sexual contact with the ex-Penn State football coach. Dottie Sandusky, who has stood by her husband - including posting his bail - told jurors on Tuesday that she never saw anything inappropriate between her husband and the boys. When asked by lead prosecutor Joe McGettigan why the men might lie in making the accusations, she said: 'I don't know what it would be for,' while shaking of her head. Scroll down for video . Wife: A smiling Dorothy Sandusky, wife of former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, arrives on the sixth day of her husband's trial . She said one of accusers, dubbed Victim 10 in court records, she did not know at all. She described Victim 1 as 'clingy,' Victim 9 as 'a charmer' and Victim 4 as 'very conniving, and he wanted his way and he didn't listen a whole lot.' Victim 9 testified last week that he was attacked by Jerry Sandusky in the basement of their home and cried out for help while Dottie Sandusky was upstairs - but she never responded. She said the basement was not soundproof and she would have been able to hear shouting if she were upstairs. Jerry and Dottie Sandusky were married in 1966, and have no biological children together. They adopted six times and were also foster parents. Back in court: Former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky arrives at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte . Dottie Sandusky, who isn't charged in the case, also said the visiting boys were free to sleep upstairs if they wanted to. The accusers have said Jerry Sandusky directed them to the basement, where they allege he sometimes molested them on a waterbed that was in the room. Also Tuesday, a psychologist testifying for the defence in the Jerry Sandusky trial says the former coach has a personality disorder characterised by excessive emotionality and attention-seeking. Arrival: Dottie Sandusky emerges from a vehicle at the Centre County Courthouse, in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . Elliot Atkins said that he interviewed Sandusky for six hours before diagnosing the ex-coach with 'histrionic personality disorder.' Atkins explained to the court that people with the disorder often interact with others in inappropriately seductive ways and don't feel comfortable unless they're the center of attention. Sandusky's attorney Joe Amendola is hoping to convince jurors that the disorder could explain his client's letters and other interaction that prosecutors allege shows his grooming of victims. 'Based on my evaluation of Mr. Sandusky, I have diagnosed a histrionic personality disorder,' said Atkins. The psychologist's testimony followed attempts . by defence lawyers earlier in the day to discredit the prosecution's . case by suggesting investigators had coached testimony from one of the . Sandusky's alleged victims. Sandusky . faces 51 counts of child molestation after the prosecution dropped one . charge of unlawful contact with minors on Monday. If convicted on all . counts, the former defensive coordinator for Pennsylvania State . University's successful football program faces a sentence of more than . 500 years in prison. The case has . focused renewed national attention on the issue of child sexual abuse . and prompted the firing in November of Penn State President Graham . Spanier and legendary head football coach Joe Paterno. Paterno died of . lung cancer in January. Leaving court: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie left the courthouse in separate cars after the sixth day of the ex-coach's child sex abuse trial . The former defensive coordinator for the Penn State University football team, Sandusky, 68, denies all 51 counts of committing abuse. Atkins told the court that Sandusky's histrionic personality disorder definitely explained his grooming behaviour. He told the court that he spent six hours with the accused, read the personal emails he sent to some of the alleged victims and also read his autobiography, 'Touched.' In the case of Sandusky, Atkins outlined . that histrionic means 'dramatic' or 'theatrical' and that people with . the disorder need the approval of other people and act up and create . unusual situations to make sure they are the centre of attention. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky arrives at the Centre County Courthouse . Atkins confirmed that people with this mental condition, 'might do something dramatic to draw attention to themselves.' This would include acting in a way that is 'inappropriately sexually provocative.' The defence move to highlight Sandusky's mental fragility comes after a string of prosecution witnesses, including eight alleged victims, testified that he groomed them and abused them while they were with his Second Mile charity for troubled children. The eight alleged victims, now men aged 18 to 28, . testified for the prosecution last week, describing in often graphic . detail being molested by Sandusky as boys, including oral and anal sex . and shared showers. Defense attorney Joe Amendola reacts to a question as he arrives at for the sixth day of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse trial in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . Two other alleged victims have never been . identified. Many have criticised the use of this defence. 'This would be an incredible stretch - so much that it disturbs some of my colleagues that they are bringing it up,' said Gail Saltz, an an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine to MSNBC. 'This diagnosis has no bearing on your moral compass, your ability to understand what's legal,' she said. 'It has nothing to do with being a pedophile. It has nothing to do with sexual behavior toward children.' Earlier in the day, defense lawyers took aim . at law enforcement officers' testimony that they had not discussed abuse . accounts offered by fellow accusers with other alleged victims in the . closely watched case. Amendola . questioned Pennsylvania state trooper Corporal Scott Rossman and retired . trooper Joseph Leiter about a taped interview they held with one of the . accusers, known in court documents as Victim 4, and his attorney in . April 2011. The interview was . played in court and Leiter was heard saying to Victim 4 during a break . that investigators had interviewed about nine other potential victims. In some cases 'oral sex has taken place by both parties,' which would be . considered rape under state law, he said. Leiter . could be heard saying telling the accuser that his story 'word for . word' followed those of others. 'He has taken advantage of you. We need . you to tell us what happened,' Leiter is heard saying. Under . cross examination by a prosecutor, Leiter said he considered the . interview technique to be appropriate and never suggested to a victim . what he should say. It was the . second day of the defense case after the prosecution rested its case on . Monday. A still image from 'All my Children' which ran from 1970 to 2011 and was known for its outlandish plotlines . Judge John Cleland told jurors on Monday he expected closing . arguments to take place on Thursday. Two . university officials also face charges of perjury and failure to report . suspected abuse in an alleged incident involving Sandusky and a boy at a . Penn State locker room. Earlier Tuesday, defense attorney Joe Amendola  told reporters to 'stay tuned' to find out if Sandusky would take the stand himself, comparing the case to a soap opera. Asked which soap opera, defense attorney Joe Amendola initially said 'General Hospital,' then 'All My Children.' These dramatic developments came on the same day that TMZ released an unaired clip from the November telephone interview between Sandusky and Bob Costas during 'Rock Center with Brian Williams'. Satellite trucks are parked in front of the Centre County Courthouse as the sexual abuse trial of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky . Speaking about the attention which he paid to the young boys under his care, Sandusky stopped short of denying that he ever sexually abused young children. 'I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped.' NBC was criticised for not playing the clip back in November, but 'NBC Nightly News' hit back saying, 'There were a lot of compelling comments in the original interview but we did not have time to include them all.' Sandusky is charged with 51 counts involving 10 boys. He denies the allegations.

When it comes to the dating scene in New York, it's a jungle out there. However an Ivy League-educated surgeon is proof that not even looks, status and financial security can give you a head start in the love stakes. Doctor Emil Chynn, who was educated at Harvard, posted a personal ad in the alumni magazine of Columbia University - offering a $10,000 donation to charity for an introduction to the woman of his dreams. The ad appeared in the classified section of the University's Spring 2012  edition, it was reported.

While Dr Chynn, who runs a practice in Kipps Bay, has not elaborated any further on the advert, it would seem the 43-year-old's search for the right lady has been fraught with difficulty in recent years. In 2010 he posted an advert on Craigslist for a female personal assistant whose role would include helping to find him a girlfriend.

Callous dog owner Mark Lacy has been banned from keeping animals for a decade after he neglected his own pet so badly it developed terrible skin conditions, pneumonia and hypothermia. In these horrific images Staffordshire bull terrier Breeze appears hairless and emaciated after months of neglect by Lacy at his home in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear. The 42-year-old failed to take the animal to a vet when it developed three separate illnesses and the eight-year-old dog later contracted pneumonia. Disgraceful: Staffordshire bull terrier Breeze was discovered suffering from pneumonia, hypothermia and serious skin conditions . RSPCA officers discovered the starving animal following a tip off by someone worried about the dog's condition. Once inside Lacy's house, the inspectors discovered the animal was an 'emaciated state' with a constant cough and an obvious skin complaint. Last week, Lacy pleaded guilty at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court to three counts of causing an animal unnecessary suffering. Gaunt: RSPCA officers discovered the starving animal following a tip off by someone worried about the dog's condition. The court heard that a vet found Breeze had lost all her hair, suffering from alopecia as well as pneumonia, and they said the weight loss was down to malnutrition. She also had hypothermia and officers said she had to be put down. On his last appearance in court, Lacy was warned he could be jailed over the treatment of Breeze, and was back in the dock this week to be sentenced. Banned: Mark Lacy has been banned from keeping animals for a decade after he mistreated his own pet . Magistrates gave him a 12-week prison sentence but suspended it for 12 months, and disqualified him from owning animals for 10 years. Lacy can apply for the ban to be lifted after five years. RSPCA inspector Jaqui Miller said: 'It is a very good result and one that matches the severity of this case. 'Breeze was really suffering, and had been for a long time. 'That meant that, ultimately, we could not save her. 'I think the magistrates have come to the right decision.' The court heard that Lacy was 'embarrassed' by his failure to get eight-year-old Breeze the right medical treatment. Clive McKeag, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, said: 'She was almost totally devoid of hair and the inspector could see she was severely underweight, and all of her ribs, spine and hips were on show, and she had a constant cough.'","Owner banned from keeping animals for a decade .

This is the moment a lorry driver crashed through closing barriers just moments before a high-speed train thundered past - and didn't even notice. Geoffrey Peachey, 54, drove straight over the level-crossing in his 44-tonne lorry - oblivious to two sets of flashing red lights and a warning klaxon. The HGV driver then continued with his journey blissfully unaware of the wreckage dangerously left lying on the line in his wake. Crash: Geoffrey Peachey's lorry collides with the closing barriers which can be seen hitting the top of his vehicle in this image . Peachy admitted failing to stop at the crossing when the case came to court. Magistrates told him the consequences of his blunder could have been 'catastrophic'. CCTV caught Peachey's articulated lorry smashing the red and white barrier as he made his way across the tracks leaving debris on the tracks moments before an express train was due. Paul Brown, prosecuting, told Cambridge Magistrates' Court that Network Rail had been forced to step in to prevent a disaster. He said: 'As the level crossing barrier starts to fall it caught on the lorry or the back end of the trailer of the lorry. 'It then ended up falling on to the tracks. Mr Peachey was not aware that it had caught the barrier on the way through and so he carried on without stopping. 'Network Rail became aware that it had happened at the crossing and this affected traffic for the rest of the day.' Geoffrey Peachey, who lives on a farm in Ely, Cambridgeshire, admitted failing to stop at Ely north railway level crossing, on Bridge Road, at 12.37pm, on July 20. He was banned from driving for three months after admitting the charges. Oblivious: Peachey, who has been banned from the roads, continues along the road without realising he has snapped half of the barrier off . Charles Snelling, defending, said that Peachey was a 'trusted' driver but had been unable to see the flashing red lights. He said: 'Because of his position in his cab he couldn't see the lights and the klaxon was straight in front of him and he didn't hear this either.' Brenda Anderson, presiding magistrate, described the offence as 'serious' during the sentencing on Tuesday. She said: 'This is a serious offence aggravated by it being at a busy level crossing. The repercussions could have been catastrophic.' Peachey was disqualified from driving for three months and ordered to pay a £135 fine, £70 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Speaking after the case, Sgt Linda Welch, the investigating officer, said Peachey had put himself and others in danger. She said: 'Level crossings are designed to keep people safe and do so when used correctly.'","HGV driver Geoffrey Peachey didn't spot two sets of red flashing lights and a warning klaxon .

A ‘despicable’ father was jailed for three years today for stealing £16,500 raised for his dying son - and not leaving enough to pay for his funeral. Julian Emms, 46, plundered a charity fund for his son Michael who was Britain’s youngest victim of motor neurone disease. Friends and family carried out sponsored events to raise £55,000 to send the brave teenager to China for pioneering stem cell treatment. 'Despicable': Julian Emms, right, stole £16, 500 from a trust fund which was set up for his dying son Michael . But a judge today said Emms had ‘betrayed’ the fundraisers by plundering the Michael Emms Trust Fund after the treatment failed. He left just £1,300 in the account - not enough to pay for Michael’s funeral when he died last year, aged 24. Judge Robert Britton told Emms: ‘This was a most despicable crime and there was a degree of cunning. ‘You were in a position of trust and the victim was your son who was relying on this fund. ‘But the emotional loss to Michael’s friends and family was also huge and this was the greatest form of betrayal.’ The judge said the money taken by father-of-three Emms has never been recovered. Prosecutor Meirion Davies said: ‘A lot of work by a lot of good people had helped put money in that fund. Beneath contempt: A court heard that Julian Emms left the Michael Emms Trust Fund so bare that not enough was left to pay for his son's funeral. He is pictured here with Michael . ‘What sort of man would trick his own son out of that money and use it for his own purposes? ‘It was despicable - someone who could do something like that is beneath contempt.’ Cardiff Crown Court heard Emms tricked . Michael’s grandmother Anne Brandon who was one of the four people . authorised to sign the charity’s cheques. Problems: The court heard Emms had a £15,000 business debt at the time the cheque was cashed . Mr Davies said: ‘Emms said he was booking a holiday to the USA for Michael and needed two cheques. ‘One was for £3,000 for the holiday and the other was £300 for insurance. ‘Mrs Brandon wrote the cheques out to a . travel agency called Travelcare and signed them - but left them blank . because Emms didn’t know the exact amounts.’ But the court heard Emms altered one of the cheques to get his hands on the £16,500. The jury heard Mrs Brandon and her husband David had ‘second thoughts’ and asked for the cheques to be returned. Mr Davies said: ‘Emms was upset that they were suspicious but they had every right to be. ‘Emms went to their home and burned the cheques in front of them. ‘It was theatrical and carefully calculated to hide the fact that one of them was a blank piece of paper.’ The court was told Emms had already cashed one cheque for £16,500 after changing the payee to ‘cash’. Mr Davies said: ‘Police searched his his home for the money but Emms told them: ‘It is not here - I spent it.’ ‘He had carried out a cold-blooded and deliberate deception then lied to extricate himself from a deeper and deeper hole.’ The court heard Emms, of Beaufort, Ebbw Vale, South Wales, had a £15,000 business debt at the time the cheque was cashed. Emms had broken up from his wife Theresa at the time he allegedly stole from the trust fund. The family had to take out a loan to pay for Michael’s funeral when he died in April last year. Emms, who was found guilty of fraud at an earlier hearing, showed no emotion as he was led away to the cells. Crown Prosecution spokesman David . watts said after the case: ‘Many people who gave to the fund will feel . let down and angry to learn what happened to the money they contributed . in good faith.’","Julian Emms stole thousands from son's trust fund after treatment failed .

Gavin Smith, 57, a top 20th Century Fox executive was spotted with a woman in California a week after he went missing . A missing studio executive for Fox has been spotted in California with a woman, it has been claimed. Gavin Smith, 57, failed to pick his son up for school or turn up to work on May 1 and has not been heard from since. His distraught family launched a media campaign hoping that a member of the public would come forward with news of his whereabouts. But it has now emerged that Mr Smith was seen having dinner with a woman on May 7 at Taco Temple in Morro Bay, according to a diner sitting nearby. David Brill said that he saw the executive with a tall woman at the Mexican restaurant but didn't realise who it was until the next day. He said: 'I noticed on the Yahoo main page that there was a news link to a missing Hollywood executive,' Brill told news station NBC LA. 'I happened to click on the link, saw the photo, and said, ""Oh boy, that's the guy I saw in the restaurant the previous night"".' A waitress at the restaurant confirmed Brill's account saying she served the quiet couple who said they were from 'down south'. Sgt. John O’Brien says the police have received hundreds of calls about Smith since his disappearance, but the leads were 'obviously not him'. The apparent sighting comes after the Los Angeles sheriff's department changed the status of the case to a criminal homicide investigation. The married father of three, was reported missing earlier this month, and was last seen leaving a friend's house after returning from a business trip. 'He was still watching TV downstairs when our friend went to bed, and he was going to be going up to bed shortly,' his wife Lisa told ABC News. He was last seen driving away from the friend's home in Oak Park, north of Los Angeles at around 10pm in his black Mercedes sedan. The first alarm bells went off when he failed to pick up his youngest son to drive him to school on Wednesday morning, and then never went to work or call the office that same day- two things that his wife said had never happened before in the past 21 years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Family: Gavin Smith with his wife Lisa who is desperately searching for him since his disappearance almost a month ago .

'We want you to come home, baby, we love you! Our world is not right without you! Be safe,' she said, fighting back tears. In spite of the calls for tips from the public, there have been no significant finds. Family members have since been unable to 'ping' the missing man's cellphone, which appears to be off and that his credit cards have not been used since Tuesday night. 'We're just doing our best to get as many people looking as possible,' his son Evan Smith, a forward for the University of Southern California basketball team, said in an interview.

Athleticism runs in the family, as Mr Smith gained notoriety in Los Angeles for being a part of UCLA's 1975 national championship basketball team under legendary coach John Wooden. Evan said that friends first became concerned when his father failed to turn up at the film studio, a job he loves. 'My dad's a good guy, a very responsible man, and it all really took hold for us when he didn't show up for work,' he said.

He admitted reading books about intelligence agencies to help him plan his activities. He said he tracked down Bick after a . contact gave him the name of a 'Peter' living in Bexhill, showed him a . digital picture and told him a 'rumour' of what he was alleged to have . done. Hunnisett said he investigated and met several men called Peter before he found Mr Bick.

Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan - a deputy director of the Natanz uranium enrichment facility - was killed when a magnetic bomb planted on his vehicle detonated.

Mr Harding described his joggers as mainly contract workers - anything from students to semi-professional soccer players - and suggested that they would leave feats of endurance to the Olympians.

A detective broke into a sleeping woman's home and raped her after she had turned him away at the end of a date, a court heard today. The prosecution claim detective sergeant Trevor Gray forced the security chain on the front door of his alleged victim’s house, then made his way upstairs and attacked her as she slept. The jury was told that minutes earlier, Gray, 47, had sent a text message to the woman from the street outside, which read 'You are harsh', after she asked him to leave so she could go to bed. Masked: Detective Sergeant Trevor Gray hides from cameras at Derby Crown Court this morning, where he faces charges of rape and attempted rape . Derby Crown Court was told the pair, who met through mutual friends, had been out for drinks earlier that evening before sharing a cab. But the 43-year-old said she was 'shocked' when Gray got out of the taxi at her house in Mapperley, Nottingham. Jurors heard she invited him in out of 'courtesy' for no more than 15 minutes, before telling him she was tired and asking him to go. But Steven Coupland, prosecuting, said this 'upset' Gray’s plans to have sex with the woman - and minutes after leaving he returned. Mr Coupland said: 'He tried to call her but she ignored his calls, and texted and asked her to get him a cab. 'Instead of him calling a cab himself, he decided to return to her address despite the fact it had been made plain he was being asked to leave. 'He rang the bell. He did not take the message. He found the door was not locked but had the security chain on to make it secure. Derby Crown Court, where jurors were told the alleged victim ignored Gray when he sent her texts, phoned her and rang her bell . 'What he did was the force that chain. He went upstairs to where she was sleeping and went into her room. She woke to find he was on top of her.' The court heard the woman had a 'limited recollection' of what happened next, despite only having a small number of drinks while out with Gray, who has been suspended from Nottinghamshire Police. But Mr Coupland said she recalled he tried to get her to touch him intimately, before raping her. Jurors were told the next memory the woman had was waking up at 5.30am to find Gray still in bed with her. Giving evidence, she told the court she was left feeling 'terrified', and like a 'prisoner in her own home', unable to confront Gray, who was acting 'as though nothing had happened', because her young child was there. The woman said Gray appeared to be unaware she was 'uncomfortable' - even when she asked him several times how he had got into her home during the night. The court heard Gray slept in his alleged victim's bed, then acted 'as though nothing had happened' She eventually plucked up the courage to call him a taxi, and as he was leaving, spotted the broken security chain. She told the jury Gray said, 'Don’t worry, I’ll fix it', causing her to lose her temper and push him out of the house. The court heard that later that day, she told a friend her version of what had happened, then called Gray 'to go through the sequence of events'. However, she said Gray appeared 'cold', and when he asked her 'Does this put you off me?', she hung up. The following day, she spoke with a police officer friend, who reported the matter to her superiors. The court heard that after his arrest, Gray claimed he had returned to the woman’s home and found her door ajar before forcing his way in because he 'thought something might have happened to her'. Mr Coupland said Gray told officers he then made his way upstairs and was invited to stay by his alleged victim, who was an 'active participant' in sex. The court heard Gray added that the pair had 'parted on good terms' with a kiss on the doorstep, and had no idea anything was wrong until he received her phone call. Jurors were told the pair had met on a night out with mutual friends around a month before the alleged attack, on July 24 last year. They swapped phone numbers and exchanged 'jokey' texts before meeting for a drink. The woman said Gray appeared 'articulate, funny and pleasant', and they met again in Nottingham City Centre. But she said that despite only having three glasses of wine and lemonade, and a 'strong-tasting' vodka and coke bought for her by Gray, she could not remember much of the evening. She told the jury she had a 'vague recollection' of being unable to understand why Gray got out at her house. The woman added: 'I never invite people back to my house. Even if I have decided someone is okay, it is not something I do. I did not even find him attractive. 'I vaguely remember saying he needed to go, I needed to go to bed, and he needed to get a taxi from the top of the road. He went out the back door. 'My memory is of locking the door and putting the chain on. I remember being woken by the bell ringing lots and lots of times. I just ignored it and went back to sleep. 'The next thing, I was aware of a naked person. He was over me. I was in bed. It was not what I wanted.' Gray, of Nottingham, denies rape, attempted rape, and sexual assault. The trial continues.","Trevor Gray slept in alleged victim's bed and then acted 'as though nothing had happened', court hears ."

A father has spoken of the terrifying moment his six-year-old daughter was savagely attacked by a pack of six dogs. Maya Wicksteed was visiting a neighbour with her father, Bruce, at Baldivis, south of Perth, when she was set upon by three Arab Bullmastiffs and three other dogs. She suffered horrific . facial injuries in the relentless attack, but is now in a stable condition after undergoing cosmetic surgery on her face.

Recalling the ordeal on Friday afternoon, Mr Wicksteed said his daughter was 'a screaming ball of sand and blood.' He had been fixing a vehicle near the property when he heard his daughter's screams. Savage attack: Maya was set upon by three Arab Bullmastiffs and three dogs (file picture) Mr Wicksteed described 'a horrible feeling in my gut' when he realised what had happened. He told how he ran over and saw the neighbour had come to Maya's aid by laying over her to shield her from the four-foot-tall, 130-pound dogs. 'I realized Maya was lying underneath him and his wife was lying down in the path of the dogs to try to shield my daughter,' Wicksteed said reported Perth Now. 'I feared for my life. I picked up a length of hose and just started whipping them.' Mr Wicksteed said he then grabbed his daughter and ran towards the house as the vicious dogs chased after them. 'As we got closer to the door, I was just praying that it was unlocked,' he said. 'I slammed the door on them as they were jumping up.' 'Police later told me she had been dragged over a 130-foot area,' he said to Perth Now.

The owner is reported to have been visiting his father at the address where the attack occurred, which was posted with 'Beware of the dog' signs. They are thought to have been used to control pigs on the land. Mr Wicksteed said, 'They are a killing machine -- if a dog can't differentiate between a pig and a little girl, there's an issue.' The City of Rockingham stated it is still trying to locate the other three dogs that were part of a pack responsible for the attack. The Rockingham Mayor, Barry Sammels, said  a decision on the impounded dogs' future will be made once investigations into the incident are complete.

Open wide: Dentists have been accused of duping patients into paying for treatment they could have for free on the NHS . Unscrupulous dentists face a crackdown amid evidence that patients are being duped into paying for private treatments which should be free on the NHS. The Office of Fair Trading is today demanding an urgent and radical shake-up in the £5.73billion UK market as Britons are being 'deliberately misled' into spending up to four times more for fillings and crowns. As many as 500,000 people a year are being duped into paying for expensive private treatments that should be free under the NHS, the OFT said. Research suggest fees in this country are among the highest in Europe, with a bill for a check-up running to as much as £124. Many people struggle to find an NHS dentist at all while others are letting their teeth go to ruin because they  cannot afford the work. The OFT’s findings are a damning  verdict on new contracts for dental services which were introduced by the Labour government in 2006. Importantly, the watchdog said any qualified dentist should be allowed to offer NHS treatment, rather than the  current closed shop where a group of contracted dentists provide services based on annual quotas. This would allow individuals to choose their dentist from a wide field, so increasing competition. The OFT also argues people should be able to make direct bookings with hygienists, rather than having to go through a dentist. This would allow High Street chains such as Boots and Superdrug to offer cheap ‘walk-in’ services. The watchdog is also concerned about the hard sell of expensive monthly dental plans by some practices which can be poor value. Chief executive John Fingleton said: ‘Our study has raised significant concerns. ‘All too often patients lack access to the information they need, for example when choosing a dentist or when getting dental treatment. ‘We also unearthed evidence that some patients may be receiving deliberately inaccurate information about their entitlement to NHS dental treatment, and we expect to see robust action taken.’ Some 39 per cent of people who had been to the dentist in the past two years reported there were no leaflets or posters providing information on NHS charges. More than eight in ten people who recently received a course of dental treatment did not receive a written plan spelling out what was to be done and the cost. The OFT said: ‘We are particularly concerned to find that around 500,000 patients each year may be provided with inaccurate information by their dentist regarding their entitlement to receive particular dental treatments on the NHS, and as a result be required to pay more to receive private dental treatment.’ The OFT is also highly critical of the NHS and industry bodies for doing too little to weed out rogue dentists who mislead patients, are incompetent or overcharge. Patients’ Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said: ‘Patients frequently tell us that they are not being given the information they need to make informed choices about their dentistry treatment. They feel they are paying for treatment that may not have been necessary. ‘Dentists have been able to get away with unacceptable practice.’ The British Dental Association insisted most patients were ‘happy’. Executive board director Dr Susie Sanderson said: ‘The delivery of effective dental care is all about good communication between dentists and patients. That communication will not be enhanced by the OFT’s headline-grabbing approach to publicising this report.’ Labour’s controversial contracts resulted in thousands of dentists quitting the NHS, leaving many communities without a dentist. They were blamed for an estimated one million people losing access to an NHS dentist between 2006 and 2008. The Coalition last year launched pilots of a new dental contract, focused on improving children’s oral health. Dentists will be paid for the number of patients they care for and the health results, rather than the number of courses of treatment performed. Health minister Lord Howe said: ‘Denying patients care on the basis of misinformation is a very serious matter. Any dentist that does this risks breaching their contract and we would expect the local NHS to take action.’","Fees in Britain are among the highest in Europe .

She told news station Local 10: 'He gets out of the car. He has a knife in his hand. He takes out the gallon of gasoline and starts pouring it on my car. 'Then he starts dousing it all at me, all at my face. Then he comes around the car and starts chasing me.' Eventually, Mondesir allegedly took out a lighter and all Breton saw were flames.

The Londoner calmly chatted to his girlfriend, who was seven months pregnant, while waiting for rescuers to arrive, but was blown 180ft to his death by a gust of wind. Terror: Jake Simkins is stuck up the cliff 180ft off the ground. He clung on desperately for three hours before falling to his death . Massive cliff: The scene of the tragedy on the Greek island of Zante. Rescuers could not reach Mr Simkins . Speaking for the first time since the . tragedy, his mother Julia, 77, from Hampstead, London, said he could . have been saved if the response team had dispatched a helicopter. 'If you are going to do an extreme . sport like base jumping then make sure you go where you are rescuable,' she told the Evening Standard. 'That’s the awful thing, apparently he was rescuable, but they wouldn’t get the helicopter down to him.' 'From what we gather, the wind caught him on the rock face on his parachute and he phoned Anita (his girlfriend) to get help. Demanding answers: Julia Simkins says her son (pictured) could have been saved if response teams had sent a helicopter to rescue him . 'He was there for three hours, they didn't get a helicopter. He was taken to the local hospital and pronounced dead.' Mrs Simkins said her son, who worked . for London Underground's engineering department, was 'very hardworking' and had a passion for extreme sports. She said he had moved onto base jumping from skydiving about two years ago and had travelled around the world to do it. He was in the process of buying a flat . with his partner Anita and she believed this was to be his last jump . before they started a family together. They were expecting their first child in September and were planning to get married. Mrs Simkins added: 'This was their . last holiday before the baby. He had already done three jumps and this . was his last one before coming home.' She said she went 'numb' when she . found out about her son's death when two policemen knocked on her door . in the middle of the night on Friday. She flew straight to the island to . be with Anita. She said: 'We would like to thank . everybody on the island, but we had a lot of problems with ambulance . chasers who had falsified papers and tried to get hold of the body to . get money out of us but that's all cleared up now.' Her son's body is due to be returned . to London tomorrow. There is no date yet for the funeral, but they are . planning a natural burial in July. Anthony Adams, Mr Simkins' neighbour . at his Wood Green house for 13 years, today told the Standard: 'He was . outdoorsy, but not the kind of guy who would go for a two-day walk along . the Devonshire coast. 'He was a real thrill-seeker, you could spot it a mile off. His death is such a shock. It’s a great shame.' Failure: Greek emergency services were unable to rescue the London Underground worker, who fell onto Navagio beach on Zante after a gust of wind dragged his parachute off the cliff. Pictured is another base jumper in action . Mr Simkins had been practising base . jumping, in which parachutists jump from cliffs, bridges or buildings. The pursuit is regarded as one of the most dangerous sports in the . world. Mr Adams added: 'Most weekends he . would be off base jumping somewhere, he did it a lot. He was also into . parachuting and sky-driving. I didn’t actually see him at home that . much. He was really bubbly and outgoing, a very friendly guy.' As he dangled hundreds of feet above . the rocks on the island – also known as Zakynthos – Mr Simkins made . calls from his mobile to reassure partner Anita that he was not badly . hurt after hitting the cliff and had only injured his leg. A Greek worker who was alongside Anita contacted the emergency services, but fire crews failed to reach Mr Simkins. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘He was speaking to her constantly and letting her know he was okay. ‘He was calm, and they were even joking. Jake asked for the emergency services to throw him a rope, so he could climb down. ‘Surely three hours was enough time for the fire service to find a rope and get it to him?’ Accident: Mr Simkins was stuck for three hours as emergency services tried to rescue him from these cliff faces at Navagio beach after he base jumped with a parachute . Antonis Potamitis, who runs tour . boats to the bay and had collected Mr Simkins following other jumps, . said he had repeatedly called the fire service and begged them to bring a . specialist climbing team from Athens. He added: ‘It was a terrible tragedy. Jake was a really good man, and knew what he was doing, but somehow ended up on the rocks. ‘I asked the local fire chief to call for specialist back up, but he wouldn’t listen. ‘And even though three hours passed . and he was hanging 70 metres above the rocks, they didn’t even get a . rope down. How is that possible?’ Mr Simkins was pronounced dead after . his fall on Friday evening. His partner was taken to hospital suffering . from shock, although she was discharged on Sunday and his since flown . back to Britain. The pair were hoping to get married following the birth of their child. A local on the island said: ‘She was . in complete shock. She could hardly speak for the  first day. But then . it is to be expected. She came on holiday with her partner, and she left . without him.’ Mr Simkins’ partner was too upset to speak yesterday when she answered the door of his family home in north London. Friends said Mr Simkins, who worked . as a signal technician for London Underground, was an experienced . base-jumper who had undertaken more than 40 solo jumps. He had also parachuted down to Navagio beach – known as ‘shipwreck bay – on three occasions before his fatal fall. Base-jumping is an extreme sport in . which participants leap from a fixed point before using a parachute at . the last minute to break their fall. The word ‘base’ is an acronym of the . four points from which they can leap: buildings, antennas, spans . (bridges) and earth (cliffs). A spokesman for the Foreign and . Commonwealth Office said: ‘We can confirm the death of a British . national on June 8 in Greece. We are providing consular assistance to . the family.’","Julia Simkins says son Jake was 'rescuable' but teams didn't send a chopper .

Mark Parsisson popped into his local William Hill to place a bet on the popular horse racing event, with little Amelia, who was unwell. He got chatting to the cashier Vicky Leonard, who immediately recognised the . symptoms, and wrote the condition down for him on a betting slip. Mark and Jane Parsisson, with son Jake and daughter Amelia: A bookie diagnosed Amelia's stomach condition after NHS staff failed to . Doctors at the Royal Bolton Hospital, Greater Manchester, had twice told Amelia's parents that her vomiting and incessant crying was caused by a . common problem called gastric reflux, which can usually be eased by more . frequent feeds and extra burping. But Amelia, now nine weeks old, was in fact suffering from  pyloric stenosis - a rare the narrowing of the opening from the stomach into the small intestine - that could have left her fatally dehydrated. Vicky recognised the disease because her own daughter, now 11, had . suffered with it as a baby. The condition causes severe projectile . vomiting and typically occurs in babies aged two to six weeks. All better: An operation has fixed Amelia's rare condition . Mr Parsisson did some quick research on the internet then took Amelia straight to . Manchester Children’s Hospital, where she was correctly diagnosed with . the condition. Amelia Grace quickly underwent a 40-minute operation on Monday morning which fixed the problem. Mr Parsisson said: 'It's like bringing a different baby home, she's so much more settled. We're just glad she's back and well. She's only been home a couple of days but she's much happier.' The sales manager, who lives with his wife Jane, 32, and son . Jake, 8, from Bolton has now started . legal action against the Royal Bolton Hospital. Doctors at the hospital diagnosed gastric reflux when Amelia Grace was aged two weeks and seven weeks. Mr Parsisson said: 'She was in pain constantly, crying all the time. We have been stuffing her with medication that she has not needed for nine weeks. 'I just feel that we were pacified for being over-protective parents when our baby was on the verge of death. 'I want to make other parents aware of this. I am just so relieved, we went through a journey from hell.' When Ms Leonard, 35, heard Amelia Grace’s symptoms she said she knew exactly what was wrong with her. 'It was bizarre, he was explaining what was going on with his baby and . it was like he was saying what had happened to me,' she said. 'I had the exact same problems with my daughter when she was two weeks old, it was just hell.' Luck was in: Mr Parsisson put an each way bet on Sunnyhillboy (pictured right) who came in second behind Neptune Collonges (left) Pyloric stenosis affects about one in every 350 babies, usually boys. It prevents the baby digesting milk and causes them to vomit, which can lead to severe dehydration and in some cases, death. Royal Bolton Hospital bosses defended the diagnosis, saying babies with . pyloric stenosis usually lose weight as well as the other symptoms. In pyloric stenosis, the muscles in the lower part of the stomach enlarge, narrowing the opening of the pylorus and eventually preventing food from moving from the stomach to the intestine . Head of communications Heather Edwards said: 'If a baby is only . displaying vomiting without being dehydrated and losing weight this is . more likely to be a different diagnosis such as gastric reflux. 'We’re very sorry if Mr Parsisson feels that staff did not explain this . to him fully and also that he did not feel they were taking his concerns . seriously. 'Meanwhile we’re pleased to hear that little Amelia is well and hope she continues to make good progress.' And Mr Parsisson's flutter paid off as well. He put . a fiver each way on Sunnyhillboy, who came in a very close second.","Hospital doctors misdiagnosed baby Amelia with gastric reflux .

Double life: Ray Mawby (centre) with dfelloe w Tories Edith Pitt (left) and on way to the House of Commons, 1955 . They show that the former MP for Totnes in Devon, who died in 1990, sold information to fund his roulette addiction and high-living lifestyle. It was previously known that some Labour MPs, including the former minister John Stonehouse, had spied for the Czechs. But this is the first time a Conservative has been shown to have engaged in passing information to the communists. Secrets: MP Ray Mawby in 1958. He was codename 'Laval' by his Czech handlers . Yesterday MPs called for an investigation into Mr Mawby’s secret past and warned that the claims amount to treason. The evidence, uncovered by the BBC, runs to hundreds of pages. The working class Tory was recruited when he was 38 after he attended a cocktail party at the Czechoslovak embassy in November 1960. An early report written by a handler said: ‘His leisure time he spends in bars... and also loves gambling. While playing roulette and other games he is willing to accept a monetary “loan” which was exploited twice.’ In the years that followed, Mr Mawby regularly charged for information, normally at around £100 a time. One of the Czech files has a receipt signed by the MP himself. ‘Mawby has also promised to carry out tasks such as asking questions in Parliament according to our needs,’ a Czech handler wrote in a plan on how to use him in 1962. That plan involved asking him to supply more confidential material ‘gradually deepening the compromising of his position’. He later supplied spies with a . floorplan of the prime minister’s Commons office, lists of parliamentary . committees, information about colleagues and a supposedly confidential . parliamentary investigation into a Conservative peer. The Czechs were surprised when he became assistant postmaster general and a junior minister in 1963. His handler feared the promotion could . end their deal as it meant a salary increase of £2,000, but the MP . continued to spy for the communists. Much of  the information he passed was . political gossip. A handwritten note from 1963 reports on leadership . machinations within the Tory Party. As the 1964 election approached, the . Czechs realised he could lose his ministerial job and developed a plan . to pay him £400 a year for information to make up for his loss of . salary. Inquiry: Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, left, said the charges amounted to treason while Leader of the House Sir George Young said the public needed to know the full story . As well as supplying information about . the layout of the PM’s parliamentary office, he provided details about . its security arrangements. Meetings took place sometimes three or . four times a month but dwindled by the end of the 1960s. The BBC said . the file showed the relationship ended in November 1971. The former electrician was deselected . as an MP in 1983 and died in 1990. Last night ex-Tory minister David . Mellor said: ‘Ray was an old school full-time MP, ie he was more likely . to be found in the bar rather than doing anything useful. He was a very . jovial character. 'If you had to spend a long night . having a laugh and a joke with Ray and others, you would. He was a . simple, straightforward guy. I knew nothing of his gambling.’ MP Sarah Wollaston, who represents Mr Mawby’s old constituency, called for an inquiry. She said: ‘These very serious . allegations, amounting to treason, need to be fully investigated, but . also fairly investigated because Mr Mawby is not here to defend himself . and it’s in none of our interests to have trial by media.’","Raymond Mawby sold lists of parliamentary committees, information on colleagues and confidential investigation details .

The Duke of Edinburgh plans to be by the Queen's side at a second river Thames pageant later this month despite ending up in hospital after the last water-themed event to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee. Prince Philip fell ill with a bladder infection and was in hospital for five nights after standing in the cold rain for more than four hours during a parade of more than 1,000 boats along the River Thames in London. It was Prince Philip - himself a brave young wartime naval officer - who particularly wanted a water-borne tribute to his wife of 64 years. Together: The Queen and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, are pictured onboard the Spirit of Chartwell during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the River Thames in London . The thrones remain empty: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh remained resolutely standing throughout four hours of wind and rain during the river pageant . Doctors have suggested that braving the elements on the deck the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell, in cold and wet weather during the pageant might have caused his subsequent bladder infection if he did not make enough visits to the toilet. But his illness seems to have done little to diminish the Lord High Admiral of the Fleet - a position lovingly bestowed upon him by the Queen to mark his 90th birthday - of his well-known fondness of all things maritime as he intends to be back on top form for the next water pageant in Berkshire. The Duke - who quietly celebrated his 91st birthday with his family yesterday - will accompany the Queen on a visit to Henley-on-Thames on June 25 where they will travel on the 130-year-old steam launch Alaska to witness the annual ceremony of swan upping. Good news: Prince Philip smiled and waved as he headed home to be with his family at Windsor for a private birthday celebration on Sunday . Walking tall: The Duke of Edinburgh looked in good spirits as he left hospital on Saturday . The Royal couple will travel from . Hambleden Lock in Berkshire across the river to the Henley Business . School in Berkshire where they will disembark to watch the rest of the . river pageant from the shore. It . is understood Prince Philip is determined to be well enough to attend . the river festivities but it will depend upon his doctors giving him the . all clear to go. It comes . as Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Prince will miss a garden party . at Sandringham in Norfolk tomorrow being held to thank residents of . Norfolk and Suffolk for contributing to community life. Heading home: The Duke of Edinburgh had not thought he would not be back at Windsor in time for his birthday after spending five nights at the hospital with a bladder infection . Royal visitors: Princes William and Harry smiling visited their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital . The . last time a garden party was held at Sandringham was in 2002 to . celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee. The Duke of York will instead . stand in for his father and accompany the Queen. A . Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke of Edinburgh will be . continuing his convalescent at home and therefore will not attend . tomorrow's garden party at Sandringham or accompany the Queen on her . East Midlands tour later this week. 'The Duke of York will now accompany the Queen at tomorrow's garden party.' The . Duke was also due to join the Queen, along with the Duke and Duchess of . Cambridge, in Nottingham on Wednesday as she continues her Jubilee tour . of the UK with a two-day trip to the East Midlands. Emotional time: The Queen looked much happier after visiting Prince Philip in hospital on Wednesday compared to how she had seemed to be in at St Paul's Cathedral on Tuesday . Unwell: Prince Philip waves during Sunday's pageant on the River Thames. He was taken ill the following day . Treatment: Prince Philip's bladder infection could have been exacerbated by not taking enough toilet breaks during the Diamond Jubilee River Pageant . Philip . was set to take part in the engagements on Thursday, including a visit . to Hitchin Market Square and Hatfield House, but a Buckingham Palace . spokesman confirmed he would no longer be attending.

In her first interview since the tragedy, Mrs Badger said the paper bag of ashes did not seem dangerous as her boyfriend, Michael Borcina, had ran his hands through them. Scroll down for video . Pain: In a heartbreaking interview, Madonna Badger, who lost her three children and parents in a house fire on Christmas Day, said she considered taking out the deadly ashes - but went to bed . He then placed them on top of a plastic bin in a mudroom, which caught her eye as she walked up the stairs in the early hours of Christmas morning. 'I remember thinking to myself, ""I should put that . outside. I should put that outside"",' Mrs Badger told the Today show. 'Then I remembered . thinking, ""No, but I watched him put his hands through it"".' An hour later, she woke up choking on smoke but did not hear fire alarms sounding, despite her belief that the home, which was undergoing renovation, was installed with smoke detectors. 'It was silent,' she said. 'It was the scariest silence.' She climbed out of bed and crawled to the bedroom window, hoisting herself down to the floor below as she struggled to breathe. Tears: She also recalled trying to save her daughters from the flames - and how doctors told her of their deaths . As she looked through windows, she realised she had a horrifying decision to make. 'The . windows were my mom and dad's windows,' she said. 'So I had to decide, . ""Do I go in and save them? Or do I go save my children?"" And so I ran . the other way to save my children.' She ran to the side of the house and climbed up scafolding to get to her daughter Grace's room. 'I . opened that window and the smoke that hit me, it was just the blackest, . like an ocean,' she recalled, sobbing. 'There was twirling and there . was embers and all kinds of stuff in it. 'I kept trying to hold my breath and put my head in. And I couldn't get in.' Adding that she couldn't see any of the girls inside, she said: 'I'm just screaming . for somebody to help me. It was the blackest smoke I've ever seen. If I . could have seen them, I would have gone in. 'It's impossible to describe how it is that you can't . go in and save your own children, but I couldn't get through that smoke. I couldn't.'

Badger was taken to hospital where it took three . hours for a doctor to tell her that her children had died and her . parents probably would not survive. 'I . just couldn't believe it,' she said. She immediately called friends and . family, including her ex-husband and the children's father, Matthew . Badger. Dream home: The $1.7 million mansion was undergoing renovation and did not have activated fire alarms .

The . devastating tragedy came after Mrs Badger had enjoyed an evening at her . $1.7 million Stamford mansion with her boyfriend, children and parents. They . had set the table for the following day and Mrs Badger had opted for . electric candles over ones with flames, 'to be safe', she said. At . around 9 p.m. the girls went to bed, where Borcina read them How the . Grinch Stole Christmas! and Mrs Badger stayed up talking to Lily and . Sarah, who shared a bed.

Sobbing . during the interview on Today, which was previewed earlier this week, . she said that she has struggled to come to terms with the tragedy. Killed: Mrs Badger was faced with the agonizing decision of whether to try to save her parents (pictured) or her three daughters from the flames. She ran towards the three girls . Loving: Mrs Badger remembered her father Lomer, a mall Santa, as 'amazing' with his daughters . 'The first time I smiled or the first time I laughed, I felt so bad,' she said. Mrs . Badger added that she still has questions about the fire, which killed . her family although she believed the fire and smoke alarms were working. Three weeks ago, she filed a notice . of intent to sue the City of Stamford, claiming that they had pulled . down the home the day after the fire without her permission - destroying . crucial evidence. Mrs . Badger claimed that destroying the home and its contents - valued at $3 . million - prevented her from getting compensation for the 'extreme . emotional distress and mental anguish' she suffered. The city had deemed the large Victorian home unsafe before pulling it down. Officials ruled the blaze started when . Borcina placed a bag of glowing embers in a bag by the home. Prosecutors . have decided that criminal charges will not be filed, as some . precautions were taken at the time and, although they proved . insufficient, they could not be considered criminal negligence. Stamford's State Attorney David Cohen said Borcina cleaned out the . fireplace at about 3.30 a.m., and placed the ash into a paper bag. Family: Mrs Badger immediately called her ex-husband after a doctor told her the three girls had died . Grief: Mr Badger said his life ended the day he picked up the phone to be told of his daughters' deaths . He . said the man smoothed the ashes with his hand to prove to Madonna there we no . live embers. They were then placed in a plastic storage box and placed inside the exterior door in the mudroom. By . 5 a.m., the home, which was undergoing renovation by Borcina's company . and did not have its fire alarms activated, had caught ablaze. Mrs Badger's interview comes after . her ex-husband and the father of her daughters, Matthew Badger, spoke to . People magazine about the moment was told of their deaths on the phone. 'It ended my life,' he said. 'I'm a father, I'm a father. I [messed] up. I wasn't there to save them.' He . said that he is overcome with grief each day. 'If I don't cry every . day, the waves are bigger,' he said. 'If I cry every day, it is less . dramatic. I don't think the loss is ever going away.' Unable to return to his job as . television commercial director, he has instead poured his efforts into . creating and maintaining a fund in the girls' memories, the LilySarahGrace Fund. Remembered: Mr Badger has set up a charity in the girls' names to raise money for art programs in schools . The non profit organisation works to . bring arts education into public schools as the Badger girls, who were . all dyslexic, loved art.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:26 EST, 23 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:37 EST, 23 May 2012 . Ordeal: Natalie Carney believes her cervical cancer could have been caught sooner if she had been allowed a smear test . A cancer sufferer aged just 22 who became one of the youngest women in the country to have a hysterectomy has hit out at the NHS for not giving her a smear test which she believes could have saved her fertility. Natalie Carney faces an early menopause, chemotherapy and radiotherapy after having her womb removed following the devastating diagnosis earlier this year. Now Natalie, who became one of Britain's youngest ever hysterectomy patients when she underwent the gruelling in March, believes she would not necessarily have faced infertility if she had been legally allowed to have a smear test to spot her cervical cancer. The former air hostess, who is coming to terms with being unable to bear children and going through the menopause before her mother, said if she had been given a smear test at age 20 her cancer could have been treated in its very early stages. The age at which women in England are offered regular smear tests is 25 even though the rest of the UK offers screening at 20. The screening age was only increased from 20 to 25 in 2003 as health bosses claimed it did more harm than good in younger women. Doctors missed several opportunities to diagnose Natalie’s cancer and she was left suffering symptoms for months before the 3.5cm tumour was eventually found. Despite initially being hopeful the cancer could be removed through fertility-preserving surgery, she was later told she would need a radical hysterectomy, then chemo and radiotherapy. She now faces a race against time to harvest her eggs before she begins treatment in the hope that she and her boyfriend of six months Adam Burton will someday be able to have a child. Natalie said: 'I shouldn’t be in this position. My cancer had been growing for as long as 18 months before it was discovered. If I had been given a smear test at the age of 20, it would have been pre-cancerous and they would have caught it in time. 'I feel like my future has been destroyed and I have been forced to rethink everything. Adam and I have only been together for six months and now he may be my only hope to have children.' Natalie first experienced symptoms in January last year when she started to suffer abdominal pains but it was only when the pain became unbearable in July that she went to Nottingham’s A&E department to seek help. Pretty in pink: Natalie, pictured here on her 18th birthday, had her cervical cancer dismissed as 'women's troubles' and cervical erosion before medics gave her the diagnosis . There she was brushed off and told she was suffering from ‘women’s troubles’. Natalie was so concerned by the pains she visited her GP a few weeks later and after a brief external examination was told it could be gall bladder infection but was probably nothing to worry about. Cervical cancer symptoms do not always present all at once so when the pain went away on its own, Natalie decided to take the doctors’ advice not to worry. However, in November, she started her relationship with Adam, 23, and experienced more pain when their relationship became physical. But when she returned to her GP after suffering bleeding, there was still no mention of a smear test - with doctors instead recommending she be tested for sexually transmitted infections. Natalie said: 'I wasn’t very happy about that, I felt like she was assuming I had been sleeping around even though before I got together with Adam I hadn’t been in a relationship with anyone for over a year. 'Like a lot of girls, I had lost my virginity at 16 but I was responsible and I had been suffering from stomach cramps for the last year. I knew it couldn’t be that but I agreed to the tests anyway. 'The nurse explained to me that it would be just like a smear test but I had to say to her that I had never had one because I was only 20 so I wasn’t allowed one. 'At no point did it occur to anyone to offer me a smear test.' Natalie began bleeding while the swabs were being taken and from the look on the nurse’s face, she says, she knew there was something wrong. Natalie, pictured at a charity prom earlier this year with boyfriend Adam, 23, has had to come to terms with not being able to bear children . The doctor was called in and it was agreed that Natalie would be referred to a gynaecologist. But, she says, she was assured it was unlikely there was anything wrong because of her young age. The doctor and gynaecologist were convinced Natalie was likely to be suffering from a condition called cervical erosion which can cause bleeding in between periods. However a colposcopy and biopsy revealed the worst possible truth. Natalie’s test results came back as positive for cancer. She said: 'Once someone tells you that you have cancer your whole world stops right there. 'I couldn’t take in anything else the doctor said after that. I felt dizzy and sick for the rest of the day, it just wouldn’t sink in.' Following an MRI scan Natalie was told that she may be able to have a trachelectomy, an operation that would remove the affected part of her cervix and then repair it to give her a good chance of being able to have children in future. But on closer inspection of the scan results it was decided the tumour was too large to treat in this way and a radical hysterectomy would be necessary. Her tumour had been graded IB-I meaning it was less than 4cm in size and at stage one. She added: 'My womb would be removed so I would never be able to carry children of my own but it would mean I would still have my ovaries so I wouldn’t go through the menopause and I might someday be able to use my eggs in IVF and have children through a surrogate. 'Until then I had never really given my fertility much thought. I was studying at night to become a nurse and I was concentrating on my career but I had always imagined that I would have a family someday. 'Now I was being forced to think about the future and how it wasn’t going to pan out the way I imagined.' Natalie underwent the four-and-a-half hour operation in March at Nottingham City Hospital during which her lymph nodes were removed to be tested to see if the cancer had spread. Constant reminder: Natalie shows the scar running up her naval on the day she underwent the hysterectomy operation in March this year . But two weeks later she received the news she had been dreading - that the cancer had advanced to her lymph nodes and blood vessels, meaning five weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy which would rob her of her fertility. Natalie said: 'I was devastated. I was going to have to watch all my friends have children and my sister who already has a child bringing their families into the world and I would never be able to do the same. 'The treatment was supposed to start in three weeks and it would take at least four to harvest my eggs. The cancer specialist told me not to hold my breath if I wanted to get funding but that they would delay the treatment for an extra week.' Now Natalie is in a race against time to harvest enough eggs to create a few embryos with her partner Adam that will be frozen for the future. Family fear: Natalie, pictured right with her mother Melanie and half-sister Danielle, 20, has battled through the procedure with family support . Even though the young couple have not been together long, Adam agreed to the procedure which would give Natalie’s eggs a greater chance of survival. Even if the IVF is successful, there is only a 32 per cent chance the embryos will take once they are reimplanted. Natalie’s half sister Leigh-ann Cooke, 30, is at high risk for cervical cancer and receives a smear test every six months. But despite the family history, Natalie’s other sister Danielle, 20, was told she was not eligible to have a test when she visited the doctor to ask for one. As a young mum, Danielle is at higher risk of cervical cancer too. Happier times: Pictured in July last year before a holiday with four friends, Natalie had no idea what heartbreak lay ahead of her . Natalie said: 'I’m dreading the chemo and I’m trying not to think about how much it will make me sick. Mostly I am terrified of lymphoedema which is one of the common side effects of the drugs they use. 'I’m also scared of going through the menopause as even my mum hasn’t gone through it yet and I don’t know what to expect. Natalie is part of a campaign to have the age limit lowered and says she is proof that women are being overlooked by the law. The Mercedes Curnow Foundation, set up in memory of the woman by the same name who died of cervical cancer aged 23, recently presented a 122,600-signature petition to Downing Street asking to have the age limit for smear tests lowered.","Natalie Carney diagnosed with cervical cancer over a year after reporting pains to her GP .

A Dutch entertainer is being sued for threatening to sell the secret behind one of Penn & Teller's signature magic tricks for just $3,050. Raymond Teller, the smaller and silent member of the pair, is taking legal action against Gerard Dogge after he posted online a video offering to expose the method behind his 'Shadows' illusion. Dogge, whose stage name is Gerard Bakardy, asked viewers at the end of 'The Rose & Her Shadow' clip he posted on YouTube last month to cough up the cash. Scroll down to see Teller performing the trick... Little and large: Penn Jillette (left) and Raymond Teller (right) make up the hugely successful Penn & Teller act. Teller is suing a Dutch entertainer over copyright infringement after, he claims, he stole his trick . Original: Raymond Teller claims he owns the copyright to the trick, which he says he invented in his bedroom as a teenager . Teller, who claims to have the copyright to the trick, contacted Dogge after seeing the video - which he also demanded YouTube remove from its site. Knowing that legal action would probably be more costly, he first offered to pay the fee himself. But Dogge is said to 'have countered with a much higher sum'. He then threatened to sell the secret if Teller did not 'come to terms soon', according to the legal complaint filed in the federal court of Las Vegas this week. Teller is seeking a permanent halt to any copyright infringement, plus damages.

It can be a catalyst and force change and good policy in this country.' Brand has given frank accounts of his battle to overcome drug addiction and has said society needs to change the way it views addicts. Brand said he was not calling for 'a free-for-all where everyone goes around taking drugs'. 'Addicts will always be able to get drugs', he said, 'whether they are illegal or not.' However, he added he was not qualified to talk about legalisation. Instead, he said addiction should be treated as an illness and society should recognise that addicts, with the proper help, can become active and useful members. He said society should not 'discard people, write them off on methadone and leave them on the sidelines'. Instead, society should 'neutralise the toxic social threat they pose as criminals'. Asked if there should be a carrot and stick approach, he said it should be more about 'love and compassion'.

'I don’t think they’re going to be affected by that because they’re normally on drugs,' he said. Asked about the role of celebrities, he said: 'Who cares about bloody celebrities?' Brand said that, instead, he wanted to offer people 'truth and authenticity'. Chip . Somers, chief executive of the detox centre Focus 12, where Brand . sought help with drug dependency, said: 'Just to park people on . methadone for four to seven years is criminal.' Abstinence was an 'admirable aim for everybody', he said, but he admitted that not everyone would achieve it. 'I don’t think methadone is a good thing.' He added he thought many methadone users were also using other drugs. Both Brand and Somers said the number of people criminalised for possession should be reduced. Man of the people: As he left Portcullis House, Brand met with children visiting the Palace of Westminster .

An NHS trust has been fined a record amount after it sold computer hard drives in an online auction without first removing confidential details about patients with HIV. Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust has been served with a Civil Monetary Penalty (CMP) of £325,000 following a serious breach of the Data Protection Act. The fine is the highest issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office since it was granted the power to issue CMPs in April 2010. Security breach: An individual working for an IT provider removed at least 252 of the approximate 1,000 hard drives he was supposed to destroy from Brighton General Hospital (pictured) in 2010 . It follows the discovery of highly sensitive personal data belonging to tens of thousands of patients and staff - including some relating to HIV and Genito Urinary Medicine patients - on hard drives sold on an Internet auction site in October and November 2010. The data included details of patients’ medical conditions and treatment, disability living allowance forms and children’s reports. It also contained documents containing staff details including National Insurance numbers, home addresses, ward and hospital IDs, and information referring to criminal convictions and suspected offences. The data breach occurred when an individual engaged by the Trust’s IT service provider, Sussex Health Informatics Service, was tasked to destroy approximately 1,000 hard drives held in a room accessed by key code at Brighton General Hospital in September and October 2010. A data recovery company bought four hard drives from a seller on an Internet auction site in December 2010, who had purchased them from the individual. The ICO was assured in its initial investigation following the discovery that only these four hard drives were affected. But a university contacted the body in . April 2011 to advise that one of their students had purchased hard . drives via an Internet auction site. An examination of the drives established that they contained data which belonged to the Trust. The Trust was unable to explain how the individual removed at least 252 of the approximate 1,000 hard drives he was supposed to destroy from the hospital during his five days on site. He is not believed to have known the key code needed to access the room where the drives were stored, and was usually supervised by staff. However, the Trust has acknowledged that the individual would have left the building for breaks, and that the hospital is publicly accessible. David Smith, the ICO’s Deputy Commissioner and Director of Data Protection, said: 'The amount of the CMP issued in this case reflects the gravity and scale of the data breach. 'It sets an example for all organisations - both public and private - of the importance of keeping personal information secure. 'That said, patients of the NHS in particular rely on the service to keep their sensitive personal details secure. 'In this case, the Trust failed significantly in its duty to its patients, and also to its staff.' The ICO said the Trust has since committed to providing a secure central store for hard drives and other media, reviewing the process for vetting potential IT suppliers, obtaining the services of a fully accredited ISO IT waste disposal company, and making progress towards central network access.","Individual working for IT provider removed at least 252 of the approximate 1,000 hard drives he was supposed to destroy from Brighton General Hospital in 2010 .

Critical: Aimee Copeland is battling for life in intensive care after contracting a flesh-eating bug . Only a week ago, doctors gave a young Georgia woman battling a flesh-eating bacterial infection little chance of survival. Now Aimee Copeland, 24, was alert and bored enough to have asked for a book to read, her father said yesterday. The graduate student remained in critical condition at an Augusta hospital, unable to speak because of a breathing tube in her throat as she continued to fight the life-threatening disease that took hold after she gashed her leg in a fall from a broken zip line. Doctors had to amputate most of Miss Copeland's left leg to save her life, and her father has said she'll likely lose her fingers too. But her father said that doctors now believed that they'll be able to save not only the palms of his daughter's hands but her right foot as well. Her parents said they've learned to read lips and are now able to communicate with their daughter who was also asking for ice-cream. 'This doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Andy Copeland said in a telephone interview. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely amazed.' He said his daughter seems aware that she's in the hospital after an accident. But for now, they're sparing her the details of her condition until after she has been removed from a respirator and is breathing on her own. 'I'm not sure how much (she knows) as far as the leg and the hand amputations. I don't have those discussions with her,' Copeland's father said. 'But if she asks we will tell her.' More...

Mother-of-two survives for three days in crashed car by drinking soda and rainwater - and then smashes her way out of wreckage despite broken bones . He said the family also wanted to make sure a hospital counselor was available to help Copeland once she is informed of her condition. Losing a limb is extremely difficult emotionally, and can be particularly difficult for young people, said Dr. Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. Scroll down for video . All you need is love: Aimee Copeland was described by friends as 'someone really awesome to be around' 'There is a process that they go through, a grief process,' said Kaslow, who is not involved in Miss Copeland's care. 'There is shock, disbelief, anger, sadness and then a period of reconciling one to the situation and healing and figuring out how they are going to move forward in their life.' A graduate student in psychology at the University of West Georgia, Copeland contracted the rare infection called necrotizing fasciitis. It happened days after she suffered the deep cut on May 1 when the zip line snapped over rocks in the Little Tallapoosa River. Doctors at the local emergency room in Carrollton closed the wound with nearly two dozen staples, but it became infected within days. On May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital. Distraught: Paige Copeland, center, cries as her parents Donna and Andy Copeland speak about their daughter Aimee after she had her leg and fingers amputated . Copeland's father said she faces a long recovery not just from her amputation but also from kidney failure and other organ damage caused by the infection. 'She's going to be here for months,' he said. 'She's going to need to regrow skin that was removed. She's going to need to learn to use prosthetics. She's going to still be on dialysis for a while.' Infections by flesh-eating bacteria are rare but sometimes can run rampant after even minor cuts or scratches. The bacteria enter the body, quickly reproduce and emit toxins that cut off blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat and skin tissue. Affected areas may have to be surgically removed to save a patient's life. The bug that infected Miss Copeland, called Aeromonas hydrophila, is found in warm and brackish waters. Many people exposed to these bacteria don't get sick. When illnesses do occur, it's often diarrhea from swallowing bacteria in the water. Cherished: Miss Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate from Georgia, has fun with friends . Flesh-eating Aeromonas cases are so rare that only a handful of infections have been reported in medical journals in recent decades. Some news reports have said Miss Copeland was recently diagnosed with lupus, a chronic disease that compromises the immune system, but her father said that was not true. Andy Copeland said his daughter had sought treatment for a skin rash. Doctors initially feared it might be a symptom of lupus, but tests revealed Copeland had a food allergy. 'She was a vegetarian and she had a soy-based diet,' Copeland's father said. 'And it turned out she was allergic to soy.' Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father has said the progress she has made after contracting the aggressive virus was a 'miracle' More than 50 people lined up in the first hour for a blood drive yesterday at the gymnasium at the University of West Georgia, where Copeland attends school 200 miles from the Augusta hospital. Some students walked to the blood drive, while others drove from other parts of the state. Kara Dermo, a chemistry student who worked with Copeland at the Sunnyside Cafe, was one of the first in line. She was among the friends invited to try the zip line that sent Copeland plunging to the rocky river, but declined. Dermo said Copeland's illness has been weighing on the minds of people on campus. Even the slightest amount of good news has been enough to raise the hopes of fellow students. 'It's very close to home. It makes you realize anything could happen at any time,' Miss Dermo said.

But now campaigner and alpaca keeper Dianne Summers has been struck down by a severe case of the disease – caught from her own pets. Ms Summers - who has called for more stringent compulsory tests of the animals amid fears TB might tear through the UK’s alpaca population - was struck down in February with what appeared to be flu. Struck down: Award-winning alpaca farmer Diane Summers was diagnosed with the life-threatening disease four years after it appeared in her herd . But within eight days her condition had deteriorated into a life-threatening emergency. Initial tests diagnosed a severe chest infection or pneumonia and doctors prescribed antibiotics. But after symptoms got worse concerned medics ordered a chest x-ray which confirmed pulmonary bovine TB. It is thought she may have been . carrying the disease – while can have a lengthy incubation period - for . years after eight of the animals put down in 2009 when they tested . positive for bovine TB. She said: ‘In 2009 I took all the necessary precautions to protect myself and yet it has happened to me.’ The 51-year-old, from Redruth, . Cornwall, is now on the road to recovery – despite being hit by serious . side-effects from the powerful course of medicine needed to fight the . infection. She said: ‘I started a nine month . regime of a cocktail of drugs and was advised the side effects can be . very unpleasant but at least I can be cured. ‘I was also told I would start to feel better in two to three weeks time. ‘Unfortunately, eight days into the . course I had severe side effects to the drugs which included severe all . over body rash – blurred vision – faintness – severe headache and aching . joints and had to seek emergency care. Recovery: Ms Summers, who is undergoing a nine-month course of antibiotics, believes she caught the disease from her animals and is warning about the dangers of not monitoring the spread of TB tightly enough . ‘The drugs were stopped immediately . and once again I had to go to hospital. I am now on drugs to sort out . the side effects and once they have cleared then the TB drugs can be . reintroduced one at a time until we discover which drug caused the . problem. 'TB in humans isn’t a quick fix – and it certainly isn’t a case . of two weeks of standard antibiotics and you will be right as rain. Ms Summers had received an award from . the British Alpaca Society (BAS), which promotes the welfare of alpacas . and llamas for the campaign. She has urged Government bodies to . close a bovine TB testing loophole which means llamas, alpacas and other . camelids do not need to be tested. According to the Health Protection . Agency the risk of humans contracting bovine TB is low. But 500 had to . be killed after an outbreak in a farm in Burgess Hill, East Sussex, last . month. Camelids can pose an extra risk to humans because, unlike cattle, they spit a mixture of saliva and gastric fluid. There are currently 1,500 alpaca owners of an estimated 35,000 animals registered with the British Alpaca Society. As of April 2012 the number of alpaca . and llama herds that have been affected by culture confirmed incidents . of bovine TB in England and Wales was 58, according to Camelid TB . Support & Research Group. The animals, which originally come . from the high plains of Peru, Bolivia and Chile in South America, are . normally bred for their wool. Living in close proximity to animals can bring with it the danger of contract diseases common in the animal world. There have been numerous cases in Britain where owners have suffered severe and even fatal conditions caught from their pets. A conservationist from Angus, Scotland, died after contracting Britain's first case of rabies for 100 years - from a bat bite. David McRae, 56, right, failed to recover from European Bat Lyssavirus (EBL), a type of rabies, for which there is no cure, found in several northern European countries. Mr McRae, who was licensed to handle bats, was bitten by one of a species known as Daubenton's Bat on at least one occasion. Rachael Wakefield, 18, from Ashton, Greater Manchester, suffered a mysterious lung disease for five which has left her on oxygen 24 hours a day - until tests showed the symptoms were caused by her pet cockatiel. Doctors had struggled to find the route of her crippling condition, diagnosing childhood asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. But specialists at a London hospital discovered she had hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by protein dust from Penni the cockatiel's droppings. Also known as 'bird fancier's lung', it is harmless to most people but can trigger breathing difficulties in a minority of people. Doctors say Ms Wakefield's lungs would take two years to properly clear.","Doctors at first thought Dianne Summers, 51, had developed the flu .

Six people have been arrested following a dawn raid on a gypsy camp in connection with the murder of a retired farmer who was found bludgeoned to death in his own home. Llywelyn Thomas, 76, a widower and classic car fanatic, was found dead in his home in Chittering, Cambs., on December 18 last year. It is thought he was killed the previous evening during a botched burglary. Several items were later discovered missing from his home. Dozens of officers swooped on the gypsy camp in Cambridge in the early hours of this morning before arresting four men aged 26, 24, 22 and 20. They also apprehended a 16-year-old boy and a 26 year-old woman. The dawn raid at the Fen road travellers' site in Cambridge was launched at 6am. The 24-year-old man was arrested from the camp while the woman and the 26-year-old man were arrested in Milton, Cambs. The 16-year-old was arrested at a property in Ely, Cambs., and the men aged 22 and 20 were produced from prison and will be questioned by officers. Crime scene investigators spent the morning at the site sifting through evidence and searching caravans. One traveller said: 'They came storming in at about 6am. It was scary. There were loads of police and they woke everyone up and started searching the caravans.' Dawn raid: Police swooped on a travellers' site in Chesterton, Cambridge and made six arrests in connection with the murder of retired farmer Llywelyn Thomas . Officers also searched ditches and fields around the travellers’ site. Mr Thomas, a widower and classic car . fanatic, lived alone in a £500,000 converted Victorian chapel. His wife, . Glenys, died in 1999 aged 62. A silver Rover car was taken from the . property in the remote village of Chittering, Cambridgeshire, and later . found dumped five miles away in Milton. A family friend described Mr Thomas as 'The nicest man you could meet'. They added: 'He travelled a lot, he . was bubbly and used to go on lots of trips. He liked engineering and . enjoyed working on cars. It's really horrible what's happened. This is a . sign of a broken society.' Neighbour Shirley Stronge, a . 56-year-old IT consultant, said: 'His son bought him the chapel in 1998 . and converted it for him so we assumed he had a bit of wealth behind . him. He sometimes sold cars from his property. 'A few months ago there was even a truck for sale, which is surprising considering he is quite old and frail.'

Neighbour Greta Rice, 75, who lives . at a nearby farm with her  husband Raymond, said Mr Thomas was a 'very . pleasant' although 'quite reclusive' man. She added: 'He did not communicate . with other people that much. It is not a close-knit  community – the . area is quite sparsely populated. 'He would be very friendly if we walked past each other. 'It is so sad to hear that he has been murdered. My thoughts are with his son.'

Proctor & Gamble said it will change the design of packaging for its miniature laundry detergent product to deter children from eating the brightly colored packets that look like candy. Spokesman Paul Fox said the Cincinnati-based company plans to create a new double latch lid on tubs of Tide Pods 'in the next couple of weeks'. Doctors said children sometimes swallow the pods thinking they are edible. Nearly 250 cases have been reported to poison control centers this year. Worrying: Nearly 250 cases of children swallowing the detergent pods have been reported to poison control centers this year . Fox initially said that to reduce the risk of poisoning, household cleaners and laundry detergents should be kept out of children's reach. 'The packs themselves are safe, regardless of who manufactures them, provided that they are used for their intended purpose,' he said. 'The risk becomes when they're left like any other household product within reach of small, inquisitive hands.' He has since announced the new packaging. Although the 250 cases of kids eating the detergent are a  tiny fraction of the thousands of poisoning calls received every year, doctors are still concerned. The symptoms they see in connection with ingesting the packets — such as nausea and breathing problems — are more severe than typical detergent poisoning. No deaths have been reported. 'We're not quite sure why it's happening,' said Dr. Kurt Kleinschmidt, a Dallas toxicologist and professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 'But we've clearly had some kids who have become much more ill. We look at these pods as being clearly more dangerous than the standard detergent.' Tide, Purex and other detergent manufacturers introduced different versions of the packets earlier this year. The lightweight, colorfully swirled plastic packets contain a single-use amount of detergent that dissolves in water. They're intended to be dropped into a laundry machine in place of liquid or powder detergent. Error: Some kids mistake the detergent pods (left) for ribbon candy (right) and eat them . Several poison control centers started to get calls from parents about the packets in March and April, soon after they were introduced in earnest. Texas reported 71 instances of exposure this year, all but one in March or later. Missouri reported 25 cases related to the packets, and Illinois reported 26. 'If you look at the Tide Pods, they're bright blue and bright red and they look very similar to some of the ribbon candy,' said Julie Weber, director of the Missouri Poison Control Center in St. Louis.While the detergent packets are a threat, poison control centers receive far more reports about other substances annually. In 2010, they fielded thousands of calls about potential poisoning to children under 5 from ibuprofen, diaper rash cream and other household substances.However, doctors are alarmed about the packets because they appear to be more dangerous than just swallowing liquid or powder detergent.Dr. Michael Buehler of the Carolinas Poison Center said there were several possible reasons why, including that the packets carry a full cup's worth of detergent in bite-size form or the detergent in the packet might activate more quickly or differently. Caution: Purex said its detergent pouch packs come with warning labels about keeping away from children . 'The children get sicker, more severe, and they do this quicker than what we've seen with standard liquid laundry exposure,' Buehler said. In suburban Philadelphia, a 17-month-old boy was home with his mother when she 'turned her back for the proverbial second,' said Dr. Fred Henretig of the Poison Control Center at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The boy climbed up on a dresser and popped a detergent package in his mouth, Henretig said. The boy vomited, became drowsy and started coughing.

A teenager today told of the terrifying moment she clung to the side of a car ferry to stop herself being sucked under it to her death. Vicky Redfern stepped onto the narrow ledge on the outside of the vessel after a the engine of the speedboat she was on stopped working and the boat drifted into the side of it near the millionaire's playground of Sandbanks in Dorset. With the speedboat at risk of capsizing, the 18-year-old sat on the 10-inch wide shelf and desperately held on to it for fear of falling into the water and being dragged under the 100ft-long ferry. Lucky escape: Vicky Redfern in front of the Sandbanks chain ferry which she had clung to for dear life to stop her being sucked under to her death after getting stuck on the outside of the vessel . Perilous passage: This picture shows where Vicky ended up (bottom right) after stepping off her speedboat following a collision with the ferry and the narrow ledge she shuffled along before clambering through a hatch . Precarious: Vicky was stuck on the 10in-wide ledge for around five minutes until a passing lifeboat managed to alert ferry staff, who opened the hatch . When staff on the ferry were alerted to her plight, they opened a hatch and Vicky carefully stood up and shuffled 30ft along the ledge that was 2ft above the water. After she reached safety, a passing lifeboat threw a line to speedboat owner Robert Hodges, who remained on board the broken-down craft, and pulled it away from danger. Vicky had been on a day out in Poole Harbour, Dorset, with friend Phil Hodges, 19, and his dad Robert when the incident happened. Phil had just got off at a slipway on the Sandbanks peninsula to use the toilet before the engine of the 18ft boat seized and it drifted helplessly on the current towards the ferry. Robert, 48, told Vicky to jump onto the ledge along the side of the Sandbanks chain ferry as there was a risk the suction from it would have swallowed the boat up. Imminent danger: Her friend's father Robert Hodges told Vicky to jump onto the ledge along the side of the ferry as there was a risk the suction from it would have swallowed the speedboat up . 'Potentially nasty incident': An RNLI spokesman said Vicky was extremely lucky to escape because the choppy conditions that day made it far easier for her and the speedboat to be dragged under . Vicky, who is waiting to join the army, said: 'We stopped to let Phil off but then another boat came along and needed to get where we were. 'We started the engine up and moved out the way but then it stopped working and the current pushed us into the side of the ferry. 'Rob told me to climb onto the ferry and hold onto the side in case the boat flipped over. 'I knew if I stayed on the boat I could have got sucked under the ferry but I was trying not to think about it otherwise I would have panicked and been in even more danger. 'I pushed myself up onto the side and sat there and drew my knees to my chest. I grabbed hold of the ledge either side of me to make sure I didn’t fall in.

Drama: The engine on the speedboat broke down near the wealthy Sandbanks peninsula (pictured) which left the craft drifting on the current towards the ferry . 'Luckily after about five minutes an RNLI lifeboat passed by and they got the ferry staff to open a side hatch for me. 'I got onto my feet and turned around so my back with to the water and held onto a railing above my head and shuffled sideways until I got to the door. 'It was a big relief when I stepped onto the right side of the ferry and I was even more pleased to see Rob being towed to safety.' Robert, an engineer from Poole, said: 'I got Vicky out onto the side of the chain ferry because I was worried the current and suction would make the boat flip up and she would fall out. 'It all happened so fast. I was just pleased that everyone was okay and came away with no injuries.' A spokesman for the RNLI said: 'The boat was perilously close to the ferry. 'It could easily have been sucked under as the conditions out in the harbour were rough and choppy. 'It had the potential to be a nasty incident and they were extremely lucky we just happened to be passing.'

Rescue: The 77-year-old had a miraculously escaped falling to his death after losing control of his paraglider when passersby sat on his chute . Miraculous: Quick-thinking passersby dashed over to the stricken paraglider's chute and sat on it before the pensioner could continue falling down the 120ft cliff at Eype, near West Bay, Dorset . Several heroic members of the public saw the emergency unfold and rushed to the edge as the yellow and white canopy draped over the top of the grassy cliff. They sat on the chute to stop the pensioner, who was tethered to it by a rope, desperately clung on  to the rocks for 30 minutes until he was plucked off the cliff face by a coastguard helicopter. The man, who has not been named, was then flown to hospital with a dislocated right hip. The dramatic incident happened as the paragliding pensioner, who was part of a larger group, was flying above the cliffs at Eype, near West Bay, Dorset, at 6pm last night.

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:27 EST, 29 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:49 EST, 29 May 2012 . Michael Gove yesterday warned Lord Justice Leveson that he risks creating a ‘cure’ for newspaper wrongdoing that is ‘worse than the disease’ of phone hacking. The Education Secretary repeatedly clashed over freedom of speech with the judge running the media standards inquiry. He challenged the entire basis of the inquiry and insisted that existing law is sufficient to police the media and prevent wrongdoing. Warning: . Education Secretary Michael Gove repeatedly clashed with Lord Justice . Leveson as he urged the inquiry not to introduce new laws to police the . media . Mr Gove argued passionately that anything else risks undermining free speech and warned that previous public inquiries that have imposed regulations on other industries have made things worse not better. His outspoken defence of a free Press seemed to rile Lord Justice Leveson, who insisted new rules were needed to curb excesses even as he claimed he would uphold freedom of the press. Mr Gove, a former leader writer for The Times which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, also refused to copy other senior politicians by distancing himself from the media tycoon. Instead he described the media mogul as ‘one of the most impressive and significant figures of the past 50 years’. It emerged yesterday that he met Mr Murdoch and his senior aides on 11 occasions between the general election in May 2010 and July last year. But he denied that they discussed the News Corporation boss’s business interests. Mr Gove said journalists were ‘exercising a precious liberty’ when they wrote articles. He said: ‘I am concerned about any prior restraint and on their exercising of freedom of speech.’ He said it was impossible to prevent newspapers causing offence to some portions of the population and that attempts to protect one group would ultimately undermine the ability of the media to hold the powerful to account. Clash: Mr Gove's outspoken defence of a free press appeared to rile Lord Justice Leveson who repeatedly insisted that new rules were needed to curb excesses . But a clearly irritated Lord Justice Leveson said: ‘Mr Gove, I do not need to be told about the importance of freedom of speech, I really don’t.’ He said he was ‘concerned’ by Mr Gove’s view that behaviour which is ‘unacceptable’ has ‘to be accepted because of the right of freedom of speech’. But Mr Gove was unbowed and said that attempts to stamp out wrongdoing could make things worse. He said previous inquiries had led to regulations that were ‘applied in a way to be a cure worse than the disease’. • Guardian journalist Amelia Hill and a Scotland Yard detective who was accused of leaking confidential information from the police phone hacking inquiry will not be prosecuted. The Crown Prosecution Service said it would not be in the public interest to bring charges.. THERESA MAY ANNOUNCES NEW MEASURES TO COUNTER POLICE CORRUPTION AS SHE GIVES EVIDENCE TO INQUIRY . Questioned: Theresa May, pictured at the Leveson Inquiry today, revealed new police hospitality rules have been drawn up . Theresa May telephoned two News International executives to reveal she was launching a new inquiry into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. The revelations came amid mounting pressure on the Government over its close ties to the Murdoch empire. But Mrs May denied yesterday that she had been under pressure to deliver a favour to the Sun, which was campaigning for a new investigation into Maddie’s disappearance in Portugal in 2007. In evidence to the Leveson Inquiry, the Home Secretary was asked about the decision to order the new Scotland Yard probe, which has cost the taxpayer at least £2million. At the time, the Sun and the Sunday Times had been serialising a book by Kate McCann, Madeleine’s mother. The Sun was pressing strongly for a new investigation into the case. Mrs May said she had telephoned – at her own ‘instigation’ – former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, and Dominic Mohan, the editor of the Sun, to tell them the case would be looked at again. But she denied suggestions that she had been warned that the Sun would put her face on its front page every day until she agreed to the paper’s demands. Mrs May announced that police would no longer be allowed to accept gifts, gratuities or hospitality apart from 'light refreshments' under new rules to stamp out corruption. The Home Secretary said it was important officers did not put themselves in a position where 'people could feel that they are being influenced by the receipt of such gifts'. Mrs May revealed the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) had overhauled guidance to bring a 'clearer' set of boundaries for meetings between the police and journalists. Resigned: Sir Paul Stephenson stepped down as Met Commissioner last year following revelations he enjoyed a free stay at a luxury health spa . Mrs May said: 'I think it's trying to apply common sense to the relationship the police should have with the media.' But she reassured Lord Justice Leveson that tighter rules would not stop beat bobbies tipping off local reporters to community news stories. He said: 'It is obviously important that, for example, neighbourhood police officers should be able to speak to local press about events in the neighbourhood - good news stories, concerns, seeking witnesses, all that sort of material. 'It seems to me sensible that everything one can do to encourage that sort of contact is worthwhile.' The Home Secretary replied: 'The important thing is for officers to know where the line is drawn between who they are able to speak to and what they are able to say in those conversations. 'It shouldn't have a chilling effect but I think what's important is that we have a framework that doesn't have a chilling effect and a framework that enables common sense to be operated in these relationships.' Sir Paul Stephenson resigned as Metropolitan Police Commissioner last year following revelations he enjoyed a free five-week stay worth £12,000 at Champneys luxury health spa, where a former News of the World executive editor arrested over phone-hacking was employed as a PR consultant. At an earlier hearing, the former head of Scotland Yard told the Leveson Inquiry that he was 'reluctant' to accept the freebie but added that he felt under 'pressure' to return to work after four months' sick leave. He insisted the five-week stay was organised by the spa's managing director Stephen Purdew - and he did not know they employed former News of the World journalist Neil Wallis, an 'acquaintance' whom he had met socially on 11 occasions. Today, the inquiry heard that Mrs May was sent a briefing note preparing her for questions she might face after Sir Paul's resignation on July 17. A Guardian journalist and a Scotland Yard detective will not be prosecuted over leaks relating to the phone-hacking scandal. There is 'insufficient evidence' to bring charges against Amelia Hill, the newspaper’s special investigations correspondent, and a 51-year-old detective constable over leaks, prosecutor Alison Levitt QC said. The police officer has been suspended since being arrested at his desk last August. He was understood to be answering bail this morning, while Ms Hill has only been questioned under caution. All staff on Operation Weeting - the Metropolitan Police’s 16-month inquiry into voicemail interceptions by journalists - were required to sign confidentiality agreements before working on the case. A security review was sparked into how information about the case started appearing in the press over the summer. Despite bringing no charges, Ms Levitt has recommended disciplinary action against the officer. Police launched Operation Weeting, the inquiry devoted specifically to phone hacking on January 26 last year. Operation Elveden was launched months later after officers were given documents suggesting News International journalists made illegal payments to police officers. It included preparation for issues MPs were likely to raise when she made a statement to the Commons. One such question suggested it was wrong Sir Paul felt he could not talk to David Cameron or the Home Secretary about the matter because it might have 'embarrassed the Prime Minister because of his relationship with Andy Coulson'. Mrs May was asked if she felt Sir Paul had been unable to raise the issue but replied: 'I don't recall any such conversation.' She told the inquiry that, by the time revelations that murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's phone was hacked were published on July 4, she had 'growing concerns' about the way the Press was regulated but still broadly favoured the system that was in place. On the subject of hospitality and gifts being given to the police, Mrs May told the inquiry that the 'vast majority' of officers acted with integrity. She added: 'Occasions where there are questions to be raised are very limited.' Until now, police forces have drawn up their own hospitality guidelines, with wide divisions in what was deemed acceptable. Acpo suggests allowing officers to receive only 'light refreshments' during meetings with reporters, seemingly ruling out lavish lunches. The guidelines call for 'more robust decision-making' and recommend having a single force register of gifts and hospitality governed of the head of professional standards. They will be based on 'a shift to blanket non-acceptability save for a certain circumstances and a common-sense approach to the provision of a light refreshments and trivial and inexpensive gifts of bona fide and genuine gratitude from victims and communities'. The guidance continues: 'One extreme can properly be considered to be a breach of criminal law (the Bribery Act 2010) through to the low-level hospitality which could in no way be considered as a breach of integrity on any party involved.' Mrs May said: 'I think that is a sensible approach that is being taken by Acpo in an attempt to find a greater consistency. 'What's important isn't that they have a single force register but that everybody knows that there is a general belief that they shouldn't be taking gifts, gratuities and hospitality, except where they are of a more trivial nature.' Mrs May later set out her reasons for not ordering a fresh investigation when new phone hacking allegations surfaced in the New York Times in September 2010 - four months after she took office. She told the inquiry: 'It wasn't the role of the Home Secretary to decide whether information in a newspaper should be investigated. 'It is the role of the police officers to decide whether information that is printed is new evidence or hints at new evidence such that they feel it is necessary to investigate that.'","Education Secretary tells Leveson 'cure' for newspaper wrongdoing could be 'worse than the disease'

U.S. officials, however, say such strikes by the remotely piloted . aircraft are highly effective against militants and are an important . weapon in war against militancy. They are locked in difficult negotiations to re-open overland supply routes to NATO forces in Afghanistan, with no signs of a breakthrough. Islamabad blocked the routes last November in protest at the deaths of 24 Pakistani soldiers in a 'friendly fire' incident involving NATO aircraft. The supply lines through Pakistan are considered vital to the planned withdrawal of most foreign combat troops from Afghanistan before the end of 2014. Secretly, many Pakistani military commanders are believed to support the raids, but among the Pakistani public, where the U.S. is viewed with mistrust, the drone strikes are considered an affront to their sovereignty. Pakistan has demanded an apology over the Nato raid and an end to drone strikes against militants along the Afghan border before they will reopen the supply lines. Meanwhile, Canada has defended the use of drone attacks, claiming technological advances have reduced civilian causalities. National Defense Minister Peter Gordon MacKay told an Asian security summit  that the 'intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities we saw in Libya and Afghanistan prove the effectiveness' of unmanned systems. Canada's military has participated in the U.S.-led decade-long war in Afghanistan and also in NATO strikes in Libya last year..","There have been eight U.S. drone strikes in the past two weeks .

Depressed Brenda Nelson was discovered face down in the water after heading at ‘full speed’ into 2ft of water at Barton Marina, in Staffordshire, the coroner was told. Two hours earlier the married 66-year-old had driven towards oncoming traffic and head-on into the path of a truck, a police officer told the hearing. Tragic: Brenda Nelson, 66, had tried to kill herself several times before deliberately driving her mobility scooter into this lake, an inquest heard . Tragic Mrs . Nelson, from Barton-under-Needwood, had suffered a series of mental . breakdowns since her three-year-old daughter died in 1974, it was said. South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh ruled that Mrs Nelson ‘killed herself while depressed’. ‘Mrs Nelson was a lady with problems both mentally and physically and it was a vicious circle,’ he said. 'There was nothing anyone could have done' to prevent the tragedy, the coroner said . ‘She . was in regular pain and was very depressed. 'I believe she did take her . own life and her mental state was a major factor. I offer my condolences . to the family. ‘There was nothing anyone could have done and she seemed very determined to take her own life.’ Detective . Constable Tess Crabb, of Burton CID, earlier told the hearing at Burton . Town Hall: ‘Following a thorough investigation we found she had driven . straight into the lake at a 90-degree angle on full speed before landing . in 2ft of water. ‘We found . no suicide note but we believe her intentions were deliberate, having . tried to commit suicide a week prior as well as two hours before by . driving into on-coming traffic. 'She also asked her husband to help her . commit suicide a week before but he said no.’ The tragedy happened on September 28 last year, after Mrs Nelson went missing from home, where she lived with husband Alan. ‘At . 4.35pm we received a call that a scooter had been spotted in the lake . at Barton Marina and at 4.47pm we discovered Mrs Nelson face down in the . water,’ said Mr Crabb. ‘She was rescued by firefighters but pronounced dead at 5.45pm.’ He added: ‘Mrs Nelson lost her three-year-old daughter in 1974 . which led her to a breakdown and for her to start drinking heavily. She . attempted suicide shortly after and had a history of trying to take her . own life.’ The inquest heard how Mrs Nelson had attempted suicide a week earlier by taking drug overdose. The . coroner was also told she had declined help from a psychiatrist offered . to her by a community nurse and her GP, doctor David Okoye. Distraught: The inquest heard that Mrs Nelson has never recovered from the grief of losing her three-year-old daughter in 1974 . Dr Okoye said in evidence that Mrs Nelson suffered with a number of chronic medical conditions which affected her quality of life. At the time of Mrs Nelson’s death a neighbour said she had always seemed a ‘pleasant and polite person’. She said: ‘Mrs Nelson and her husband Alan have lived here for years. Mrs Nelson always used to be an active lady and we used to see her cycling in and around the village. ‘She also used to cook meals for an elderly gentleman who lived across the road, however, she was taken ill a few years back and ended up using a mobility scooter. ‘The couple had a daughter who died several years ago.

And as a treat, the camels will be served freshly picked strawberries. Mr Fossett said: 'They aren't the cheapest pets that's for sure, but we wouldn't change it for a thing. 'It is hard to pinpoint exactly how much we spend as there are lots of hidden costs like grooming and the upkeep of the stables but it costs thousands each year. 'They are high maintenance and you need to know how to care for them properly. I wouldn't recommend them as a pet unless you have many acres of land and a great knowledge of their needs.' After hand rearing two of the latest additions to the herd - Kazak and Sahara - the pair decided to cash in on their unique pets, setting up a company, Joseph's Amazing Camels. They now hire out their six thoroughbred mammals for parties, events and racing. And incredibly, such is the value of the UK's only camel herd, the pair have public liability insurance totalling a staggering £5 million.","Fossett family are Britain's only owners of a herd of the animals .

A Soldier who volunteered for one final tour of duty in Afghanistan was among those killed by a rogue Afghan policeman, it was revealed yesterday. Warrant Officer Class 2 Leonard ‘Pez’ Thomas, 44, had enjoyed a proud military career spanning more than two decades. But driven by a desire to make a difference, he decided on one last deployment.

Tragically, the selfless soldier was shot dead alongside two comrades by an officer in the civil order police named as Ziarahman. He opened fire on the three mentors at a checkpoint in Helmand province following an argument. The fallen servicemen were named last night as WO2 Thomas, from the Royal Corps of Signals, and Guardsman Craig Roderick, 22, and Guardsman Apete Tuisovurua, 28, of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards. The men, members of an Afghan Police Advisory Team, had been helping organise a shura – or meeting of elders – at Checkpoint Kamparack Pul in Nahr-e-Saraj when they were killed on Sunday. A fourth British soldier was injured and is in a stable condition in hospital. The killer, who is thought to have been armed with an AK47 assault rifle, was shot and captured alive.

Only half of all youngsters have heard of Harry Potter despite the boy wizard being the star of eight hit movies and the best-selling book series in history, according to a new poll. Fewer still - a quarter of seven to 14-year-olds - had discovered him through reading, says the study suggesting traditional children’s characters are readily forgotten. Other literary heroes have suffered an even worse fate in their memories as novels drift out of the national consciousness in what researchers say is due to the rise of TV and video game entertainment. Movie hit: Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in last year's final installment of the movie series based on the seven best-selling books by JK Rowling. Despite its success, however, only half of all children heave heard of the character . Fewer than one in ten had read Anne of Green Gables and Swallows and Amazons, according to the study by Worcester University. Around one in six of the 500 children questioned said it was not Heidi that lived in the Alps, but Roald Dahl's Matilda. While around one in eight thought the mountains were home to Tracy Beaker. And although over half knew that Aslan from the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a lion, nearly one in five suggested he was a giraffe and and the same proportion said he was a bear. There was also further confusion over CS Lewis's classic novel. A quarter would have been surprised to find themselves in Narnia, with 17 per cent saying the wardrobe led to the Secret Garden and eight per cent believing it ended up in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Three fifths of the youngsters questioned knew that Long John Silver appeared in Treasure Island, but one in ten thought he was from Peter Pan. The Witch, Wardrobe and a what? A fifth of children questioned thought Aslan, the beast hero of The Chronicles Of Narinia, series was a giraffe . Confusing: One in five also thought Treasure Island pirate Long John Silver (played on stage by Eddie Izzard, right) was in Peter Pan (Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook in the 2003 film, left) The survey found that classic children's characters like Jemima Puddleduck and Pippi Longstocking meant nothing to three quarters of the nation's children. It found that just one in four youngsters had heard of these characters, although Robinson Crusoe and Alice in Wonderland were better known (46 per cent and 45 per cent respectively). Yet it is the lack of knowledge about Harry Potter that is most astonishing. Enduring appeal: Roald Dahl was voted children's favourite author . The seven books chronicling the adventures of the ‘muggle’ who became a wizard have sold 450million copies since the first novel was published only 15 years ago. And the last of the eight movies, the second part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was only released last year – meaning it should be fresh in youngsters’ memory. One author whose popularity has endured, however, is Roald Dahl. He topped the list with a third of votes compared with Harry Potter’s creator JK Rowling with 21 per cent. A third of the children had read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with Wind in the Willows and Winnie-the-Pooh also enduring with 29 and 28 per cent of youngsters reading these books). Professor Jean Webb, director of the international forum for research in children's literature, at Worcester University said: ‘Thankfully to counteract this possible downturn in children experiencing the classics, there is still a very strong interest in our rich literary heritage. 'This is clearly demonstrated by the popularity of the courses in children's literature currently run across the UK and also internationally. ‘There are many students studying children's literature at undergraduate, Masters and doctoral levels at the University of Worcester. ‘Those students are parents, teachers and would-be teachers who will bring their knowledge and enjoyment to generations of children, engaging them in journeys into worlds of the imagination where they will bring to life past characters and present heroes such as those in Michelle Paver's series Chronicles of Ancient Darkness, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials and Michael Morpurgo's War Horse.’ The poll was conducted to mark the opening of The Hive, a joint university and public library.","Harry Potter unknown despite spawning best-selling book series of all time and eight hit movies .

Pictures have emerged of New York Knicks' star Jason Kidd partying hard at a Long Island club, just hours before he was arrested for drunken driving after crashing his Cadillac SUV. The two-time Olympic gold medalist told police he didn't remember the wreck early Sunday and didn't feel any pain, even though he received minor injuries and had to be hospitalized when he smashed into a telephone pole and skidding 25 feet into the woods. The new photos reportedly show Kidd, his shirt stained with sweat, dancing at a trendy nightclub prior to his arrest. The bust comes just three days after he signed a contract to become the Knick's newest guard -- the biggest star to sign on for the team in the off season. Celebration: A fan claims these pictures, taken at a club in the Hamptons, show Kidd partying hard just before he crashed his Cadillac SUV . Living it up: The crash occurred just a few miles from his $6 million summer home in the swanky village in the Hamptons . The pictures, posted by Barstool Sports, were sent in by a reader who said, 'My buddy’s wife was at last night (sic) where Kidd was partying. Said he had to be carried out by security at the end of the night because he was so wasted.' Before his wild clubbing, Kidd, 39, attended an upscale gala in the Hamptons thrown by rapper Ne-Yo's Compound Foundation, which provides money to 'empower and inspire youth in foster care.' The event was in honor of Star Wars creator George Lucas. Kidd tweeted a photo of himself and his wife Porschla Coleman looking respectable with the legendary filmmaker. From there, he went on to the SL East club, where he began drinking vodka and dancing. At some point during the night his wife went home and left him alone in the club, the New York Daily News reports. He left after breaking a light fixture when he tried to swing from it. Witnesses say he had to be supported by friends to make it to his SUV. Police allege the NBA guard blew through a stop sign in the upscale village of Water Mill on Long Island on his way home and crashed into a telephone pole, snapping it off at the base. Celebrity: Jason Kidd and his wife Porschla posed with Star War creator George Lucas at a charity event in the Hamptons hours before his arrest . Making headlines: Kidd was big news three days ago when he signed with the New York Knicks. Now it's his mugshot that is being published . The SUV also skidded about 25 feet off the road into the woods and struck several trees. The crash occurred just a mile and a half from the $6 million summer home he owns in the Hamptons. Police say he claimed he didn't remember the crash. An officer noted he had watery, bloodshot eyes and was unsteady on his feet. An officer reported smelling alcohol on his breath, though Kidd refused to breathalyzer test. Witnesses told the Daily News that Kidd stumbled out of his SUV and slumped to the ground as he waited for police to arrive. 'I saw him lying down, completely out of it. I think he was just so wasted.' Gautam Ahuja told the newspaper. After the crash, Kidd was taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries. He was then arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated. His lawyer said he will plead not guilty. New recruit: Jason Kidd, left, and Marcus Camby pose for a photograph following a news conference to introduce the New York Knicks' newest additions at the team's NBA basketball training facility . Despite the reported antics and the crash, Kidd's mother-in-law is sticking up for him. 'He was tired. He’s not a drunk!' Denotra Coleman, his wife's mother, told the Daily News. She said that Kidd has been a good father an a good husband to Porschla -- his second wife. She said Kidd just fathered his fifth child with Porschla and that he never would have driven home drunk with a small child at home.

Prior to that he had played for the Dallas Mavericks since 2008, and also led the New Jersey Nets to two NBA Finals appearances.

Tragic: Harry Harling, 15, plunged more than 100ft to his death in Dubai after an alcohol-fuelled row . At the heart of their inquiries is a mystery brawl with strangers who were not at the teenagers' illicit gathering. Officers are looking at CCTV footage showing three figures in the lobby of the building shortly before Harry disappeared. They are also investigating claims . there was a clash between the 42 partygoers and three unknown people who . complained about noise and loud music. Grieving: Nicolus and Beverley Harling, pictured, are being comforted by fellow expats following the death of their son . Harry, who had told his parents he . was staying with friends on the night of March 23, disappeared at . midnight shortly after the mystery callers to the flat in Dubai's Motor . City.

Mr Harling, 49, a former trader in . the City, said in an appeal letter to residents in the building where he . died: 'We firmly believe that our son would not have been on his own . after saying: ‘I’m getting a taxi, I’m going home’.

Chelsea has made a bid to buy London's Battersea Power Station and transform it into a 60,000 seater stadium. The Blues confirmed yesterday how they hoped to turn the Grade II* listed building in Wandsworth into 'one of the most iconic football stadiums in the world'. A 60,000-seater ground, which would take between three and four years to construct, would include the power station's four chimneys and other aspects of the existing structure as part of the design. How the stadium might look with the four chimneys if the club gets the go ahead . Chelsea maintain they have yet to decide whether to relocate but they have also insisted it is not economically viable to redevelop Stamford Bridge. That has been disputed by Hammersmith and Fulham Council, whose deputy leader, Nick Botterill, said yesterday: 'We want the Blues to stay at Stamford Bridge and - if it can be done sensibly without negatively affecting local people - increase the ground's capacity so they can retain their position as one of Europe's top clubs. 'CFC is a thriving business which contributes significant benefits to the area and we will continue to work closely with the club to explore all possible avenues for keeping them here at their original home.' Chelsea's hopes of moving rest on convincing fan-led group Chelsea Pitch Owners to sell them the freehold of their current home, something they failed to do at an extraordinary general meeting in October. SayNoCPO, the group of CPO shareholders who spearheaded the opposition to their bid six months ago said: 'The viability of redeveloping Stamford Bridge is still a very relevant issue, with Hammersmith and Fulham Council openly contradicting the club's negative projections.' It is understood Wandsworth Council have no objection in principle to a football club bidding for Battersea Power Station. For sale: Chelsea hope to buy the Battersea Power Station site . Home: Chelsea currently play at Stamford Bridge but the club claims it's financially unviable to redevelop . Chelsea are not the only bidders for the 39-acre site, which was valued at £500million in October and was put up for sale two months later amid an administration saga. The Blues said in a statement: 'Battersea Power Station is one of London's most famous buildings and has the potential to become one of the most iconic football stadiums in the world. 'Our joint bid was submitted in accordance with the sales process established by the joint administrators for the site. The process could run for a number of months. 'We also appreciate that we have many significant hurdles to address if we are to build a new stadium on the site, including winning the support of our fans, the CPO shareholders and local Wandsworth residents, as well as securing the approval of Wandsworth Council, the Greater London Authority and heritage authorities.' Any new stadium is likely to contain four separate stands in accordance with the wishes of Chelsea's fans, with a 15,000-seater single-tier south stand. The club have also offered to contribute to the cost of a planned extension to the Northern Line into the area.","The stadium would take about four years to build and would include the power station's four chimneys .

Dr Sharad Shripadrao Pandit told an inquest he denies telling Alina Sarag's family her illness was 'all in her head.' A 15-year-old schoolgirl died of tuberculosis after a series of doctor errors missed the chance to detect and cure her disease, with her GP claiming she was 'lovesick', an inquest heard today. Alina Sarag died in January last year after a GP allegedly advised her that her physical deterioration was due to mental health problems. The teenager’s father, Sultan Sarag, told Birmingham Coroner’s Court his daughter was told she needed to see a psychiatrist or even a spiritual healer. Alina's parents called her GP more than 50 times about their daughter’s ailing condition over a four-and-a-half month period before her death. She was also seen by more than five doctors at four different hospitals but medics failed to detect the curable disease. Her distraught father, broke down as he told the court: 'The doctor said to her ‘Did you meet someone on holiday? Are you missing him? 'She found it very distressing he was suggesting she was lovesick for a boy. 'He said all the problems were in her head and she should see a psychiatrist or spiritual healer.' Mr Sarag also claimed Dr Sharad Shripadrao Pandit accused him of 'mollycoddling' Alina, and refused to test his daughter for TB. He told the inquest: 'He said: ""We don’t need these tests, we are not going to get them done either.""' Alina was told by her GP that she may have bulimia and would need to see a psychiatrist, the inquest heard. Giving his version of the disputed conversation concerning his recommendation that Alina should see a psychologist, Dr Pandit said it had not taken place in the teenager's presence. 'I did not do that in front of Alina at all. She was terribly young, she was 15,' he said. 'She went to the car with her father and I asked her mother to wait. 'I wanted information from the parents, particularly the mother.' Today on the fourth day of the inquest at Birmingham Coroners Court, Dr Pandit said he 'fully accepted' TB did not 'cross my mind' despite knowing she had previously been struck down with the disease in 2009. But he denied telling her family her illness was 'all in her head.' Dr Pandit said: 'There was never any discussion about TB or sign of TB. It did not match her symptoms. I fully accept TB did not cross my mind.' 'Every time she [Alina] came to see me she walked into the surgery unaided and she never looked unwell. I would not have recorded her condition as ‘normal’ if she had not seemed so. Father: Sultan Sarag outside Birmingham Coroner's Court today.

'I would not have behaved in a threatening way to her father as her family have suggested. 'I would not have told them it was all in her head.' At the conclusion of his evidence, Dr Pandit said that, as a GP, he still did not know what else could have been done to save Alina's life. The long-serving doctor, who heads the Highgate practice, also attempted to offer his condolences to Alina's family, prompting them to walk out of the courtroom. Another GP at the Highgate surgery, Dr Khalid Iqbal, told the coroner he believed Alina did not have active TB when he assessed her on four dates in September and October 2010. Dr Iqbal eventually referred Alina to Birmingham Children's Hospital but did not pass on details of her previous history of latent TB in his referral letter. 'I don't think she had active TB at the time,' the doctor said. 'None of the symptoms were suggesting that she had TB.' Memories: Sulton Sarag and Farhat Mahmooda, Alina's parents, hold a scrapbook with pictures of Alina, pictured right at seven years old . Mr Sarag - who is also being treated for TB - told the inquest his daughter vomited up to 10 times a day and had to be carried to bed 'like an old woman with weak legs'. 'I would spend hours rubbing her back, arms, head and neck to try and help ease her pain,' he said. He added that he made more than 50 phone calls to the GP’s surgery in Birmingham but Dr Pandit failed to return his calls. Young: Alina aged one at her home in Birmingham . Mr Sarag said: 'There was mass neglect. The medical profession, as soon as they mess up they hide.' Alina first contracted TB in 2009 after a girl at her school was diagnosed with the illness. She was prescribed a course of antibiotics at Birmingham Chest Clinic but medical staff never followed up her treatment. Alina was struck down again in July 2010 after returning from a trip to Pakistan with her family. The inquest heard a simple phlegm test would have shown Alina was suffering from TB but this was never carried out. Instead, doctors shrugged off her family’s concerns and told them Alina was suffering from a chest infection despite being classed as a 'high risk' patient. Alina’s weight plummeted and at one point she was so ill she could only tolerate baby food. After doctors at Heartland and City hospitals did not detect TB, Alina was admitted to Sandwell Hospital where she stayed for five days. TB was picked up but no phlegm test was carried out and a chest X-ray was thought to have found a chest infection. She later saw a clinical psychologist at Birmingham Children’s Hospital but was in too much pain to complete the assessment. On January 6, 2011 Alina was rushed to hospital after suffering breathing difficulties and she died of a cardiac arrest. The hearing continues.","She was seen by more than five doctors at four different hospitals but none detected illness .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:05 EST, 5 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:43 EST, 5 May 2012 . A vigilante border patrol group has sworn that it will continue guarding the U.S.-Mexico border despite the death of its neo-Nazi leader in a horrific murder-suicide. Friends of Jason Todd 'JT' Ready vowed Friday that U.S. Border Guard's armed patrols will continue, but monitoring groups doubted the operations could be sustained. Authorities say the 39-year-old Ready shot and killed his girlfriend and three others, including a toddler, before killing himself in a Phoenix suburb on Wednesday in a murder-suicide which stemmed from domestic violence. It has now emerged that he was being investigated by the FBI over terrorism claims and allegations he had stolen weapons from the military. Carry on: Friends of Jason Todd 'JT' Ready vowed Friday that U.S. Border Guard's armed patrols will continue, but monitoring groups doubted the operations could be sustained . Victims: Amber Mederos with her daughter Lilly, two, were shot and killed as was Ready's girlfriend Lisa Mederos, 47, who had been living with him at the time; Ready then turned the gun on himself . The Arizona Republic reported on its . website Saturday that the FBI was already conducting a domestic . terrorism investigation into Ready's activities prior to the shootings. James Turgal, special agent in charge . of the FBI's Phoenix office, told the paper that the FBI's . investigation dated to when Ready was a member of the neo-Nazi National . Socialist Movement and continued into his participation with the border . group. He stressed that it had nothing to do with this week's shootings. However, the FBI probe into Ready's activities as head of the Border Guard could cast doubt on the remaining members' vows to continue his legacy. An affidavit accused him of possessing weapons which were 'most likely stolen from the military as they are illegal to possess and not available to the civilian market'. At work: Ready argues with 'observers' from civil-rights groups who monitored his controversial organisation . Watching: Ready scours the border for immigrants as part of his efforts with the 'U.S. Border Guard' Coupled with the labelling of the Border Guard as a 'hate group' by anti-racism bodies, the revelations could make it increasingly difficult for the border vigilantes to continue their patrols without attracting the attention of authorities . But Sean Rose, a 35-year-old Tucson man . who said Ready was like a brother to him, said he would quit his job to . keep the group going. 'He did a lot for this country as far . as protecting the border, something the government doesn't do,' Rose . said. 'I think it's good to have civilians stopping the drug market.' Groups that monitor the activities of . organizations like the U.S. Border Guard expressed doubts that it will . be able to maintain its operations. Without Ready's leadership, they . say, the Border Guard will likely disappear. 'The U.S. Border Guard is probably . finished,' said Mark Potok of the anti-hate group, the Southern Poverty . Law Center. 'It really did revolve around JT Ready.' Dispute: Police have said that there had been a reported incident of domestic violence between Ready, pictured left, and Lisa Mederos earlier in the day . Patrolling: Minuteman Project volunteer Ready, pictured at the US/Mexico border west of Douglas, Arizona in 2005 . An SPLC recent report said that . 'nativist extremist' groups like Ready's decreased by almost half in . 2011 to 184 groups, down from a high of 319 such groups in 2010. The Minuteman Project and other . similar groups have been plagued by infighting and financial . difficulties, largely splintering or disintegrating altogether. The movement's decline comes as states . like Arizona passed harsh immigration laws that included provisions . allowing local police to question a person's immigration status while . enforcing other laws, Potok said. Those laws created an impression . among some civilian border militia members that state governments were . doing more about illegal immigration, and that they no longer had to, he . said. Jennifer Allen, interim director the . Arizona chapter of the immigrant advocacy group, the Southern Border . Communities Coalition, said that organizations like Ready's thrive on a . charismatic leader, and tend to implode once that leader is gone. Distraught: A police officer walks with a man who said he had a child inside of the home where five people were shot earlier this week . Horror: Gilbert police officers walk inside the police tape outside a crime scene on Wednesday after four people, including a toddler, were fatally shot . Family: Amber Mederos, boyfriend Jim Hiott and . daughter Lilly were all shot. Lilly was still alive when police arrived . but died later in the hospital . 'What brings hate groups together is . anger and fear. So it makes sense that they would start to direct that . toward one another,' she said. 'They also attract a lot of people that . want to be mega personalities. 'And it ends up being their own worst enemy — fighting over the limelight,' she said. The SPLC also cites the case of . Shawna Forde, a former member of the Minuteman Civil Defence Corps. She . was convicted in a May 2009 home invasion that left a 9-year-old girl . and her father dead. Prosecutors said the invasion was an attempt to steal drug money to fund her group's border operations. Forde was expelled from the Minuteman . group in 2007 amid allegations of lying and pretending to be a senior . leader. At the time of the killings, she was the head of her own group . called the Minutemen American Defence. Political arena: In January, Ready announced his candidacy to run as a Democratic Candidate for Pinal County Sheriff . The SPLC's report said the killings cast a pall over the entire civilian border militia movement. But Ready began patrolling the desert . with his group after the killings, dressing up in head-to-toe . camouflage gear, helmets and boots, and carrying high-powered guns as . they traveled out into the desert to look for illegal immigrants or . smugglers. 'After we pay . our last respects and get our ducks back in a row, I'm pretty sure . business will continue. I don't think JT would have wanted us to stop.' Rose said that he never joined the . group on patrols, but that he and Ready would go out with a handful of . others about a dozen times a year on similar outings. Rose and other friends of Ready's . said they are reluctant to believe that he killed four people and . himself, and say they feel drug cartels are more likely to blame even . though police have discounted that possibility. Police say all the evidence points to a domestic-violence situation. Those killed in the rampage in . Gilbert on Wednesday were Ready's girlfriend, her daughter; her . 16-month-old granddaughter; and her daughter's boyfriend. Harry Hughes, another close friend of . Ready's and a regional director with the Detroit-based National . Socialist Movement, said he plans to continue his own one-to-two man . desert patrols. Members of the National Socialist . Movement promote white separatism, dress like Nazis and display . swastikas. They believe only non-Jewish, white heterosexuals should be . citizens and that anyone who isn't white should leave 'peacefully or by . force.' Ready was a former member of the group who said he quit to focus on his desert patrols. 'Just because Mr Ready is no longer . with us doesn't mean we're going to stop,' Hughes said. 'After we pay . our last respects and get our ducks back in a row, I'm pretty sure . business will continue.' He added, 'I don't think JT would have wanted us to stop.'","JT Ready, leader of U.S. Border Guard, shot dead his girlfriend and three others earlier this week before turning gun on himself .

A former policeman who is accused of murdering his third wife has given an extraordinary interview from jail complaining he has been portrayed as 'sinister'. Drew Peterson, 57, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the killing of Kathleen Savio. He is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio . The one-time policeman of the year, told a reporter at the Chicago Sun Times: 'I’m sick of being called sinister.' Instead he insisted he was a romantic and his disastrous track record with women was not his fault - it was because he picked 'women who changed after getting married.' The ex-cop was brought to national attention when his fourth wife Stacy Peterson disappeared in October 2007. He was suspected of killing her and disposing of her body, which has never been found. Authorities then reopened the . investigation into the March 2004 death of his third wife Kathleen . Savio, who was initially thought to have drowned accidentally in her . bathtub. But it was reclassified as a homicide after her body was exhumed and a medical examiner ruled she drowned following a struggle. Peterson was arrested and charged with her death in May 2009 and is being held on $20million bail. During the 30 minute interview in the jail's visitor centre, Peterson . spoke about his children claiming to be a good father. Drew Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left.  It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide . He said his sons with Kathleen Savio, Thomas and Kristopher, had never asked him if he had . killed their mother because they knew he had not. He also said that he told his youngest children, Anthony and Lacy, that their mother Stacy was on vacation. They are currently being looked after by one of his son's from his first marriage - Peterson has six children from three of his four marriages. When asked if he missed Stacy he said . he did sometimes, but said if she did reappear the first thing he would . do is 'ask her to sign the divorce papers.' He . said his last girlfriend Christina Raines has asked him to marry her . three years ago, but he had not seen her since she had become . intimidated by the press. Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right . Last year it emerged that Peterson had written a dozen jail-house love letters from jail, repeatedly propositioning a woman he has known since she was 14. Diana Grandel, now 40, said the former Illinois police sergeant has been plaguing her with bizarre and increasingly sexual requests, like asking for her measurements, photos of her in a bikini as well as describing what he wants to do to her in bed. He also asked her if she had any sexually transmitted diseases. In . letters, obtained by the National Enquirer, he wrote to her: 'I just . think of your smile and holding you in the dark feeling your body . against mine...I want to spend a lot of time with my lips on yours. 'I like sex with a lot of foreplay, I'm more into pleasing my partner than pleasing others.' Peterson . spoke to Miss Grandel about the disappearance of his fourth wife, . sticking to his story that she walked out on him, saying she could have . all her clothes. Family: During the interview Peterson claimed he was very close with his two children he had with his third wife, Savio: Thomas and Kristopher . He wrote: 'I have a closet full of new or like-new clothes that Stacy left behind when she abandoned us, everything from formal dresses to sweats to bikinis. 'If you want these things let me know, only you should know.' Miss Grandel told the Enquirer that she now believes Peterson may be guilty of murdering his ex-wife. She said: 'That's when I realised that Drew had probably killed Stacy. I kept thinking that Stacy would have taken her clothes if she had just run away.' The 40-year-old met Peterson when she was 14 and he was a young policeman. He rescued her and her family from an abusive father and she said she admired him for it. She wrote to him in jail to show her support following his arrest but he quickly turned lecherous. Miss Grandel said: 'I have a boyfriend and Peterson is coming on to me, while he's in jail! I think he's a creep now, and a murderer.' Peterson has served the vast majority of his sentence in solitary confinement and his only human contact is with guards who bring him his meals. Jury selection in his trial begins July 23.","Drew Peterson, 57, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio .

Air travel can be infuriating at the best of times, but spare a thought for this unfortunate woman who just wanted to get away to start a new life. Teri Weissinger, 55, ended up spending eight days stuck at a California airport because she didn’t have enough money to pay the baggage fees. She didn’t know about her airline's extra baggage fees of $60, only had $30 to her name and could not raise the funds in time for her flight. Scroll down for video . Infuriating: Being trapped in San Francisco International Airport for over a week was nothing short of a nightmare for Terri Weissinger . She then had to pay $150 to transfer . to another flight and was eventually given the $210 by a church after . eight nights of sleeping in the airport. The nightmare story began as a broke . Ms Weissinger, who hadn’t flown in five years, was trying to leave San . Francisco to begin a new life in Idaho. Ms Weissinger told MailOnline she been . self-employed for 25 years and decided to move more than 600 miles to . Idaho to work for ConAgra Foods. She booked her flight just before a . law went into effect requiring ticket brokers to disclose all hidden . fees and didn't know about baggage fees. Packed her bags: She spent eight days sleeping in San Francisco International Airport while she tried to get the cash together to fly . US Airways refused her boarding . permission despite her offer to pay the $60 fee when she landed - or . even leave one of her bags behind. Terri Weissinger flew in April, before a new federal law went into effect that requires ticket brokers to make all hidden fees clear. She had booked her flight ticket on travel website Orbitz but did not know she would be charged $25 for one bag and $35 for a second bag. Price comparison sites are making airlines offer lower up-front prices to get to the top of searches, so many rely on extra fees later on. The largest airlines in the U.S. received $1.5billion in add-on fees from luggage and reservation changes in April, May and June, reported the Los Angeles Times. But the airline said their policy . didn't allow them to let her board without paying and airport security . meant she couldn't leave her luggage. ‘She was embarrassed to beg for money,’ travel lawyer Al Anolik told MailOnline. ‘When it got out of hand she called the church. 'Last time she flew there were no charges,' he added to ABC7. 'I fly every few weeks - and I don't know what the new charges are.' While attempting to resolve her . situation by calling friends and family, she missed her plane and was . then told she had to pay a $150 transfer fee. 'I started making phone calls to . everybody I knew,' she told ABC7. 'I thought: ""It looks like I might . have to stay there tonight"".' It left her stuck, with no option but . to live in the terminal. She slept in a stairwell and was treated for . anxiety at the airport medical clinic. When she tried to plead with airport . authorities for help, Ms Weissinger claimed she was threatened with . arrest on vagrancy charges. Nightmare: She had to find places to bed down, including a stairwell, during her stay, and was treated for anxiety at the airport medical clinic . ‘It’s ridiculous,’ she told ABC 7. 'I . couldn't believe it sometimes, you know, it's just incredibly ridiculous . situation to be in.' 'It was exhausting. I didn’t have much . money and I was buying packets of trail mix. It was like going on a . camping trip without any camping equipment' Teri Weissinger . Finally she decided to call the nearby . Airport Church of Christ, which was moved by her situation and quickly . raised the $210 she needed. Robert Urbinam, of the Airport Church of Christ, said their small congregation of 65 were happy to help out. ‘We go by what the Bible teaches and . the Bible teaches to do good to all men,’ he told Patch. ‘When someone . comes to us for help, we help them.’ On her way: She was relieved when she was finally allowed to board her plane to Idaho but said she was in an 'incredibly ridiculous situation' She had previously been told by the . airline because she could not pay the $150 change fee she would have to . shell out $1,000 on a new flight. 'It’s ridiculous. I . couldn't believe it sometimes, you know, it's just incredibly ridiculous . situation to be in' Teri Weissinger . But the church only had to pay $60 for . her in the end and she actually  got put on a United . Airlines flight in a bizarre turn of events - after the change fee was dropped, she said. ‘I was relieved because I hadn’t had a . shower in eight days,' she told MailOnline. 'I didn’t we have any money. I kept thinking I was . going to leave the next day. ‘It was exhausting. I didn’t have much . money and I was buying packets of trail mix. It was like going on a . camping trip without any camping equipment.’ Film reference: She has compared her ordeal to The Terminal, a 2004 film starring Tom Hanks, where an eastern immigrant finds himself stranded at JFK airport .

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 06:42 EST, 23 February 2012 . When burglar Wayne Bishop argued last year that prison was breaching his human right to be with his five children, he was controversially awarded his freedom. However, in a move that will be applauded as a victory for common sense, the thug’s astonishing attempt to use the same excuse to beat a new jail term ended with him being firmly put behind bars. Judge Michael Stokes condemned the 34-year-old’s cynical exploitation of the European human rights legislation to try to avoid punishment. Back in jail: Burglar Wayne Bishop celebrating his release last year with his five children and is pictured with a 'world's best dad' mug . Jailing him for eight months for a . brutal assault – committed just three weeks after his earlier release – . he said: ‘I am afraid, Mr Bishop, you have to learn that other people . have rights apart from you. ‘We all have the right not to have . our homes and premises burgled. We all have the right to walk the . streets without fear of being attacked. Wayne Bishop, 34, arrives at Nottingham Crown Court, where he was jailed for eight months for assaulting a man in a Spar shop . ‘The rights that are set out by the . European Convention on Human Rights are not to be produced like the ace . of trumps to avoid a prison sentence.’ The judge noted that it was jobless Bishop’s 17th court appearance. His . previous convictions stretch back more than a decade and include a . previous assault and two convictions for threatening behaviour. The shaven-headed burglar, wearing a hooded top and padded . jacket, waved to relatives and supporters as he was led away at . Nottingham Crown Court. It is thought his five children – Courteney, 13, Katie, 12, Taylor, ten, . Brandon, eight, and Kyle, seven – will now be cared for by his sister, . Sherrie McKinley, who has six children of her own . After the hearing, Mrs McKinley blamed their jailbird father Phillip Wheelhouse for her brother’s life of crime. In a statement, read outside court by her daughter Jade, she said: . ‘Perhaps, if as children, we had had the right upbringing and guidance, . instead of our father being in and out of jail all of our childhood . life, Wayne would have been able to think before his actions. ‘Instead he follows our father’s footsteps.’ Mr Wheelhouse, 60, had insisted in an interview last month that his son . had been ‘brought up proper’ – but deserved to go to jail. ‘He should do the time for the first thing and then this time on top, to teach him he can’t get away with it,’ he said.

He was released the following month after successfully arguing that the . judgment was a breach of his human rights and not enough consideration . had been given to the fact he cared for his children. Judges ruled Bishop had a ‘human right’ to a family life – and replaced his jail term with a suspended sentence and curfew. After his release, the shameless burglar told journalists: ‘All those . people giving it a bad reaction need to think about single parents. The . benefits agency won’t help me get a job.’ He even appeared on ITV’s . Daybreak programme to argue that the public ‘needed to understand his . situation’. When asked if he would re-offend, Bishop insisted he was ‘going straight’ for the sake of his children. Yet just three weeks later he attacked a man in broad daylight after . chasing him into a Spar supermarket in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire. Bishop repeatedly punched the man in the head while his brother, Robert Wheelhouse, held him in a headlock.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:27 EST, 27 November 2011 . One of three American students arrested during violent protests in Cairo has described his first hours in custody as 'probably the scariest night of my life ever'. Derrick Sweeney, 19, from Jefferson City, Missouri, described how he was punched in the face, threatened with guns and forced to lay for hours in the dark in a foetal position. Sweeney arrived at St. Louis . International airport, Missouri late on Saturday, as 19-year-old Gregory Porter and . 21-year-old Luke Gates also landed back on American soil. Freed: Derrick Sweeney and his mother Joy express their relief over his release from prison. Sweeney, who Egyptian police claim was throwing firebombs during protests, said he feared for his life on his first night in jail . Egyptian authorities said they had arrested the students a week earlier near Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square for throwing firebombs at Egyptian security forces amid violent protests. But Sweeney said he and the other Americans ‘never did anything to hurt anyone’ and never were on the rooftop nor had handled or thrown any explosives. He called those accusations ‘100 per cent lies’. ‘The first night was probably the scariest night of my life ever. I was not sure I was going to live,’ he told AP. ‘They said if we moved at all, even an inch, they would shoot us. They were behind us with guns.’ ‘They held a bottle of gasoline to my . mouth motioning as if I was going to drink it,’ he added when he spoke . to Good Morning America this morning. Arrested: Sweeney, right, with the two other students, Gregory Porter, left, and Luke Gates, centre. The photograph is believed to have been taken in a Cairo courthouse following their arrests last Sunday . Home: Derrick Sweeney hugs his father Kevin and sister Ashley after arriving at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, Missouri on Saturday. The two other students also arrived in their home states this weekend . The students spent about six hours curled up in a near fetal position with their hands tied behind their backs, he said. But conditions markedly improved after the opening night's ordeal when they were moved to some other ‘legitimate’ jail, he said. ‘There was really marked treatment between the first night and the next three nights or however long it was,’ he said. ‘The first night, it was kind of . rough. They were hitting us; they were saying they were going to shoot . us and they were putting us in really uncomfortable positions. ‘But . after that first night, we were treated in a just manner -- as a . prisoner -- we were given food when we needed and it was OK after that . first night.’ They were given food when they needed it and allowed contact with a U.S. embassy official, Sweeney added. Despite the treatment, Sweeney, who attends Georgetown University, said he was glad he went to the protests. Welcome: Porter, pictured with his attorney Theodore Simon, speaks to members of the media after arriving at Philadelphia International Airport on Saturday. The students were released from prison on Thursday . Safe: Luke Gates is hugged by his father Bill and mother Sharon after arriving at Indianapolis International Airport on Sunday. All three American students were studying at the American University in Cairo . ‘I would still say going to the protests was a smart decision,’ he told Good Morning America. ‘I could’ve stayed farther away from the more violent scenes.’ His mother Joy Sweeney said she supported his decision to go. ‘It’s what students do all the time,’ she told GMA. ‘I haven’t always made the safest decision in my life. I want my children to live their life and not sit on the sidelines.’ All three young men were studying at the American University in Cairo. An Egyptian court ordered the students' release Thursday, and they were on flights out of Cairo two days later. All men were greeted by their anxious family members as they arrived in their home states. On arriving in Indianapolis, Luke Gates said: ‘I'm not going to take this as a negative experience. It's still a great country.’ Fight: Activists in Egypt demand the country's military rulers step down. Rallies continue ahead of the start of voting in the first parliamentary elections since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted earlier this year . Anger: Protesters gather in Tahrir Square in Cairo, near to where the American students were arrested . A spokesperson said he spoke to Gates' father, Bill Gates, shortly after his son boarded a flight out of Egypt. ‘He said he was doing very well and he was very excited to be on his way home,’ the spokesman said. Nineteen-year-old Gregory Porter was greeted by his parents and other relatives when his flight landed in Philadelphia. He is from nearby Glenside, Pennsylvania. ‘We're thrilled that he's home,’ said Sharon Sloan of Newtown, Pennsylvania, one of the relatives at the airport. ‘We think it's a miracle, definitely an answer to prayer.’ Protests have been going on in Cairo since Nov. 19, in anticipation of the landmark parliamentary elections due to start Monday. On Friday, the crowd in Tahrir Square grew to more than 100,000 people, and thousands remained there Saturday.","Three American students arrested during protests in Cairo return home .

Dog fighting is banned in both the UK and U.S. An RSPCA spokesman said: 'Having looked at the details of this game we believe it is entirely irresponsible and inappropriate. 'We would hope the makers would consider withdrawing this game and urge anyone who objects to it to contact the games company to express their disappointment about its launch. 'At best this could result in animal . abuse being seen as acceptable and at worst result in even more dogs . suffering pain and distress. 'The makers of the game might like to visit one of our rescue centres and see some of the many dogs which have been abused. 'A . lot of those we house have suffered appalling injury and neglect at the . hands of uncaring and thoughtless people involved in dog fighting.' The high profile criticism adds to . comments left on the software company’s website by outraged gamers who . blast the app as 'sick, immature, twisted and foolish.' Despite its availability for download . to kids as young as 13 for a mere £3.10, Kage Games insist the app does . not breach 'high maturity' Android guidelines.

Brutal: These images show options for people playing the controversial game, such as choosing food, drugs and weapons for the dogs . Referencing Angry Birds in their . defence, a product description points out: 'Just go slingshot some . virtual birds to kill some virtual pigs.' Then poking fun at those outraged by the bloody content of the app KG Games suggest critics can tell 'someone who cares'. Virtual world: KG Games defended KG Dogfighting by referring to the popular game Angry Birds, in which players use a slingshot to fire birds at pigs . On their website, a spokesperson for KG Games said: 'We do not condone violence towards animals or humans, and we are confident in humankind’s ability to distinguish between a rudimentary game and the consequences of real life. 'We are confident this game will be a . net benefit to dogs as it has been in our operating agreement from the . start of this project that a portion of the proceeds go to animal rescue . organisations.' The Dog’s Trust, which looks after abandoned and traumatised dogs, also weighed into the argument demanding Google remove the game from its site. A spokesperson for the Dog’s Trust said: 'We are totally opposed to any form of organised dog fighting and its promotion. 'We are appalled to see this despicable and illegal practice being touted in virtual form as entertainment regardless of any age restrictions applied.' Android has defended its decision to allow the new version of the controversial app to appear on the UK versions of the Android store. A spokesperson for Android in the UK said: 'The Android Market takedown team and the Legal team have both reviewed the app and decided it was not in violation of any Android Market policies. 'Google do not have any further comment on the matter.' THOSE WHO LOVED IT . 'As an animal lover I was initially . horrified by it, but you made your points so compellingly that I almost . bought it just to support you and the causes to which you contribute.' 'I disagree with the content in this . game but as a game fan I say keep the game up! While I disagree with . the content don't let them bully you into taking it down' 'Honestly, I feel dog fighting to . be despicable, an unforgivable crime. That being said, I believe in free . speech and freedom of expression. Gaming is a fantasy, a break from . reality, and should be treated as such no matter the content.' ... AND THOSE WHO HATED IT . 'Anyone that would play this ""game"" would do the same thing to real dogs. Anyone with a heart would be appalled by this!' 'For everyone that supposedly buys your little game just remember the rest of us and the unbelievable amount of heart we have when it comes to protecting our animals and what we will be saying about your game, your company, and everything that promotes it'. 'Moral aspects of dogfighting aside, the game sucks'","KG Dogfighting is branded as 'irresponsible and inappropriate' and could lead to dogs suffering pain and abuse, charity claims .

First class flight: Casey (pictured), Lesan and Mail were flown by helicopter from the Samboja Lestari Rescue and Reintroduction Centre in East Kalimantan . They were reintroduced to the forests of Kehje Sewen in the south of the island by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation (BOS Foundation), from its rescue and reintroduction centre in East Kalimantan. These extraordinary images show how, after spending most of their lives in human care the three orangutans were playing happily in the jungle treetops - as nature intended. The rare release of one of the world's most endangered primate species was made possible by funding provided by an international group of fundraising partners, including British charity, Orangutan Protection Foundation. The now-free trio were airlifted from the Samboja Lestari Rescue and Reintroduction Centre in the east of the island of Borneo to the Kehje Sewen forest to the south. Release team member, Jacqui . Sunderland-Groves, described what it was like to witness the orangutans . take their first steps of freedom. She said: 'Casey was not sure at first. She spent her first few moments of freedom just climbing and playing around her enclosure. Jungle trek: The trio were carried through the forest to Mount Belah, and finally released into the Kehje Sewen Forest .

'We opened the enclosure and witnessed Lesan and Mail quickly bolted out and climbed a tree together. 'Not long after, Lesan and Mail joined Casey and the three of them were seen swinging happily in the forest canopy.'

'So we had to stop several times to rest and catch our breaths. 'Finally, . we arrived at the release site where we had constructed two spacious . enclosures - one for Lesan and Mail - and another one for Casey.

Victim: Pauline Smith, described in court as a 'lovely person' was allegedly murdered for only making beans on toast for her partner's dinner . A jealous lover strangled his mistress after a row over his dinner of beans on toast, a court heard. Mother-of-two Pauline Smith, 54, was allegedly murdered at her flat in St Ives, Cambs, by John Mearns, the man she left her husband for. Cambridge Crown Court heard the 54-year-old defendant had become 'possessive, jealous and controlling' when Mrs Smith had tried to return to her family. In a recording of a 999 call played to the jury, Mearns told an operator the morning after Mrs Smith’s death last October that she was supposed to have cooked him dinner, but 'all I got was beans on toast'. He continued: 'I hope she’s not dead. She was really nasty towards me. 'I just don’t know why she was like that. I think she has got a split personality. 'I tried to stop her sticking the knife in me and I don’t know, I must have, I must have. I tried. I obviously tried to get her to stop trying to stab me.' Mrs Smith had moved out of her family home in Somersham, Cambs, in the spring of last year after one of her children discovered a text on her phone that revealed her affair with Mearns. In the days before her death she had started to tell Mearns, of no fixed address, she wanted to return to her husband. The court was told Mearns became violent because he feared their 'on-off relationship' was over. Allan Mainds, prosecuting, told Cambridge Crown Court how Mearns flew into a rage on October 26 at Mrs Smith's flat and pushed down so hard on her throat that it fractured her voicebox and caused bleeding around her eyes. Mr Mainds told the court Mearns was a self-obsessed liar who changed his story as he 'struggled to establish a defence for himself'. The defendant originally claimed he was protecting himself against Mrs Smith, who he said was 'lashing out' at him, the court heard. He then told police he did not mean to kill her or cause grievous bodily harm during the attack. The prosecution also told the court the defendant had originally claimed he was stabbed by Mrs Smith but later admitted wounding himself with the knife. Cambridge Crown Court heard John Mearns had become 'possessive, jealous and controlling' when Mrs Smith tried to return to her family . In a statement to the court, a friend of the victim paid tribute to the mum-of two saying: 'She was a lovely person.

Mearns denies murder but has admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.He is arguing he was suffering from mental issues at the time of the attack. In a statement to the court, a friend of Mrs Smith said: 'She was a lovely person. 'She was kind, never had a bad word to say and always wanted to see the best in everyone.' The trial, which is expected to last for three weeks, continues.","Cambridge Crown Court told 54-year-old John Mearns had become 'possessive, jealous and controlling'

A former factory worker who spent thousands of his savings restoring a cemetery has been banned from tending the graves of war heroes by church officials. Stephen Jackson, 62, forked out for new gates at the entrance of his local graveyard and has spent four years renovating crumbling tombs and cutting brambles. But the dedicated volunteer, who has won awards for his selfless work, has now been ordered to down tools after a meeting with religious chiefs from his diocese. Banned: Stephen Jackson, 62, spent thousands of his savings restoring St Mary Redcliffe Cemetery in Bristol, but has been told he can no longer tend the graves of war heroes by church officials . They claim he is not permitted to carry out work on graves and say he needs to apply for a permit to continue his vital refurbishments. Stunned Mr Jackson said today: 'I was so upset when I came out of the meeting. 'They told me I shouldn’t have had the gates done. What I have done, I’ve done with my own resources - but they are not going to stop me. 'For the diocese to have allowed for the cemetery to get into that position is a disgrace. 'If it was just left it would become more and more overgrown.' Mr Jackson started visiting St Mary Redcliffe Cemetery in Bristol four years ago to visit the resting place of Colston Marshall, dad of his foster father George Marshall. As a child Mr Jackson and his brother were rescued from a life in a children’s home by Mr Marshall and his wife Gladys. Savings: Mr Jackson paid thousands of pounds out of his own pocket to have the old gates professionally restored and claims he has spent £9,000 renovating the cemetery . The former Cadbury’s chocolate factory worker thought tending to the graves was a fitting way of showing his gratitude. He has renovated five graves of Victoria Cross winners, as well as the final resting place of Bristol firefighter Arthur Wale - who died in 1906 while battling a factory blaze. Mr Jackson, who lives with his brother in Longwell Green, Bristol, also began clearing other parts of the cemetery - cutting back overgrown plants and shifting rubble. He even paid thousands of pounds out of his own pocket to have the old gates professionally restored and claims he has spent £9,000 renovating the cemetery. The tireless Good Samaritan even won a First Gold Star award from his local newspaper, the Bristol Evening Post, last year for dedicating his time and money to the graveyard. He says he has always kept the church office at St Mary Redcliffe informed about any works he has carried out and they have never asked him to stop. But now the Diocese of Bristol - which is in charge of Anglican churches in the area - has said he should not do any more work in the grounds, which are a mile-and-a-half away from St Mark Redcliffe Church itself on the city’s Bath Road. Labour of love; As well as tending the graves, Mr Jackson, also began clearing other parts of the cemetery - cutting back overgrown plants and shifting rubble . Award-winning: The tireless Good Samaritan even won a First Gold Star award from his local newspaper, for dedicating his time and money to the graveyard . At a meeting with diocesan officials Mr Jackson was told he should only tend to the graves that belong to his own relatives. They also said he should not have arranged for the cemetery gates to be restored - even though he paid the bill himself. Mr Jackson said: 'I had a meeting with the diocese and they have asked me not to do any more work in the cemetery because they think it is not my concern. 'It is the first time anyone has said anything like this. 'I had told them I was trying to get the chapel restored and they told me I was not to do anything because it is consecrated ground. 'Everything I have done at the cemetery I have always informed the church office about and they know what I have been doing because I have always informed them and the council. 'When the wrought iron gates were taken away I informed the church as a matter of courtesy but the diocese have told me that they didn’t like the thought of me doing the gates.' Bristol Diocese said because St Mary Redcliffe Cemetery is now closed to burials, responsibility for its maintenance lies with the city council. It claimed that work to graves, churches and cemeteries requires a request for permission - called a faculty. In a statement the diocese said: 'Mr Jackson has been advised that, although he is welcome to look after the graves and memorials of his relatives, as a matter of ecclesiastical law, no works should be carried out on other graves and memorials or parts of the cemetery and chapel without a ‘faculty’ from the Diocesan Chancellor. 'The faculty jurisdiction is designed to safeguard consecrated church property, in particular graves and monuments. Mr Jackson has not applied for a faculty at this time.'","Stephen Jackson, 62, forked out for new gates at the entrance of his local graveyard and has spent four years renovating tombs and gardening .

A man is facing a 14-year jail sentence after he spent almost $70,000 that was put into his bank account by mistake. Joseph Bucci, from Trevose, Pennsylvania, was stunned with he discovered $69,300 in his account - particularly as, only a week before, his balance had been a mere $35. However, instead of telling the bank there had been a mistake he did what, no doubt, many would be tempted to do: He spent it. Unemployed Bucci bought himself a used Pontiac, a golden retriever and a trip to Orlando with the money. He also splashed out on food, furniture and clothes - as well as paying off bills for his family members, it was reported. The money was due to be placed in escrow for an estate but a typo made by a bank teller at Wells Fargo resulted in the money being transferred to Bucci's account instead. The bank realised the error when the recipients noticed their money was  missing and contacted police. Andrew Aninsman, a Bensalem police sergeant, told CBS News: 'I guess he thought he was in elementary school and found a quarter on the ground and said ""Finders keepers, losers weepers"".' Bucci is thought to have turned himself in to police, ABC News reported. He has been charged with theft of property lost and receiving stolen property - both of which are third-degree felonies. He faces jail sentence of up to 14 years in prison.

Tragically just six days later the seemingly healthy mother-of-two collapsed and died in an Asda car park. She was celebrating her 33rd birthday as well as that of her son Bobby junior who turned one on the same day. Distraught husband Bobby, 28, is now facing the daunting task of bringing up his two children alone. Glowing: New mum Vicky Clayton cradles new daughter Elle-Mae in her arms on the day she was born - she tragically died six days later . Speaking for the first time at the family home in Hartlepool, Country Durham, he said: 'I still cannot believe what has happened. 'I don't want to believe what has happened. It doesn't seem real. How will I ever tell our children what happened to their mummy.' Bobby revealed that Elle-Mae was born on May 9 after a short labour weighing 8lb 7oz at around 7am. Healthy and well, mother and baby were out of hospital just a few hours later. On Tuesday, Vicky was celebrating the double birthday and had gone on a shopping trip to Asda for a few items with her children and mother, Leanne. Bobby had rang Vicky to check how she was getting on with their new arrival. He said: 'She was fine on the phone and she told me the little one was having his porridge and the baby was asleep. 'She was planning on going to Asda to get some clothes for the kids that  afternoon. 'I said I'd see her later that night when I finished work and that was it.' But Vicky began to feel ill as she walked around Asda with her sister and by the time she reached the check-out she was struggling to remember and had pains in her back. As she got into the car park, Vicky suddenly collapsed. Husband Bobby Clayton is now faced with the daunting task of raising baby Elle-Mae and one-year-old son Bobby junior by himself . Happy: Bobby and Vicky on their wedding day, Bobby told how he never thought he would be without her . Frantic staff ran to Vicky's aid and paramedics rushed to the scene and desperately tried to help Vicky as her horrified family looked on. Asbestos supervisor Bobby said: 'I got a call at work after lunchtime from her sister Leanne telling me to get home straight away because Vicky had collapsed at Asda. 'I just assumed she'd fainted or something like that, and set off home. As I was driving, I kept ringing to see how things were, and Leanne was crying saying things weren't looking good and the paramedics were working on her. 'My dad then rang me to say go straight to North Tees as that's where they were going in the ambulance. 'I got there first, and then they brought her in. I was allowed to go and see her, and she had all of these tubes coming out of her. 'I couldn't believe it.

As Vicky's condition deteriorated she was rushed to James Cook Hospital, in nearby Middlesbrough, where she was put on a life support machine - but medics were unable to save her. Bobby said: 'After 20 minutes they gathered us in a room and said she'd gone. 'I was listening to what was being said, but didn't want to hear it. At first I felt like asking ""gone where?""

Aristrocrat Alexander Monson had concussion when he died in police custody in Kenya, an initial postmortem report stated today. The 28-year-old former Marlborough schoolboy's mysterious death has become increasingly controversial since a friend claimed he may have suffered police brutality. This allegedly happened after being arrested on suspicion of drugs offences near the beach resort of Diani. Dead: Alexander Monson has died while on holiday in Kenya after becoming ill while in police custody . Today, police spokesman Richard Mugwai revealed pathologists found evidence that the baronetcy heir had damage to his brain when he died. He told a local journalist: 'Part of the pathologist's summary reads 'intracranial pressure due to brain concussion following blood drain into head', but we don't want to form any outside opinion. 'The details of the report have also been handed over to the family.' After Mr Monson's death in hospital on Saturday, a close friend suggested one cause may have been rough treatment by police. Today, deputy commissioner Aggrey Adoli, who is in charge of Kenyan coast, maintained officers had treated him well. He said: 'This person was found by members of the public smoking bhang (cannabis) outside Daduri night club and immediately police officers went there to arrest him. 'He was not beaten on any of those occasions. Any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and speculative. Liberal tradition: Alexander Monson's father Nicholas, pictured with his second wife Maria . 'When he was in custody he complained of feeling dizziness and unwell, and immediate arraignment was done. 'Then he was rushed to Palm Beach Hospital with highly qualified and experienced doctors, and died in their hands while being examined.' Mr Adoli, whose patch includes the popular palm-fringed beach of Diani, added that drugs were found in Mr Monson's clothes. He said: 'A half-smoked 'sativa' cannabis was recovered from him and a further search was conducted and two white tablets were found in his trouser. 'The tablets have been taken to government chemist for analysis. We don't want to speculate at this point.' The Briton is believed to have spent several weeks living with relatives based in Kenya. Government pathologist Ngari Mbuuko and a private expert believed to have been hired by the Monson family conducted initial tests yesterday, at Pandya Memorial Hospital, in nearby Mombasa. Meanwhile samples of urine, blood, liver, kidney and intestines were sent to the capital city Nairobi for further analysis by a government chemist. Intracranial pressure is the pressure inside the skull that can increase due to brain injury.  Other causes can include tumour, bleeding into the brain or fluid around the brain, or swelling within it. Mr Monson's body remains in the hospital morgue, and it is unclear when it will be released to the family.  It is believed that his next of kin may be given samples in order to have separate tests performed by an independent expert. Contemporaries of Mr Monson at £30,300-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire included Pippa Middleton, also 28, but it is unclear whether they were friends. Mr Monson lived in London but spent much of the year in Kenya with his mother Hilary, 58, and sister Isabella, 25. The pair run the Four Twenty South complex of self-catering cottages in the Indian ocean resort of Diani, where accommodation can cost up to £800 a night. Trouble in paradise: The beach at Diani Beach the popular tourist destination on Kenya's south coast where the young British tourist died . His maternal grandparents bought the business in the 1960s. As the heir to the Monson baronetcy, Alexander was born into a life of privilege. His paternal grandfather was Lord Monson, a Lincolnshire landowner and peer. He was a champion of personal liberties who later became president of the Society for Individual Freedom. When the 11th baron died last year, the title passed to Alexander’s father, Nicholas John Monson, born in 1955. It is believed Baron (Nicholas) Monson, a publisher, is currently in Kenya with his third wife, Silvana. Last night the dead man’s grandmother, Lady Emma Monson, said: ‘I’m a widow myself. I’m bereaved. I’m now grieving for my grandson. I’m extremely upset and I just can’t talk about it.’ Kenyan Police said Mr Monson died in hospital on Saturday following his arrest. Police spokesman Richard Mugwai said he had been in custody for just a few hours when he was rushed to hospital after starting to feel sick. The officer said: ‘He was arrested outside a nightclub under the suspicion of having taken drugs. ‘We made preparations to interview and charge him but he then felt sick. We took him to the hospital and he died in the hands of the doctors.’ It is believed Mr Monson, who studied at London’s City University until 2008, entered Kenya on April 23 and was due to fly home on July 10. Mr Mugwai, the commander of Kenya’s coastal Kwale County police division, said Mr Monson was taken to the police station under suspicion of having smoked bhang, a local variety of cannabis. He was later moved to the nearby Palm Beach Hospital, where he died. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We have been providing consular assistance.’ Bhang is a natural drug made from dried seeds and leaves from the female cannabis plant. Its use originated in India and it is illegal in many countries. Popular on the backpacking scene, users often mix it with fruit or alcohol. On his Facebook page, Mr Monson's father describes himself as ‘an enthusiastic cook, a relentless writer, an occasional poet, a passionate advocate, a wayward disciple of the teachings of Epicurus and the Stoics and a devoted Apostle of Alain de Botton’. Last night a friend who knew the Monson family when they lived in Bampton, Oxfordshire, said: ‘It’s awful what happened, it makes me feel sick. ‘I heard he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly with a friend. The friend was released but apparently they found drugs on Alexander so he was handcuffed and taken.’","Former Marlborough schoolboy became ill after being detained by police .

Barclays bank is embroiled in yet more controversy after three of its employees were ordered to stand trial for alleged tax fraud. They were among 20 people charged with fraud at Italian bank UniCredit, stemming from a scheme set up by Barclays, which denies any wrongdoing. The case comes as a blow for Barclays as it tries to cast off its reputation for aggressive tax avoidance. Probe: Barclays is embroiled in yet more controversy after three of its employees were ordered to stand trial for alleged tax fraud . A Milan judge yesterday ordered top Italian banker Alessandro Profumo and 19 others to go on trial. The case centres on suspected tax . fraud in 2007 and 2008 at Unicredit, arising from . the use of a complex Luxembourg-based offshore financial scheme . provided by Barclays. Barclays is alleged to have enabled . UniCredit to earn interest of around 20 per cent in 2007 – around five . times the amount it could have achieved on the inter-bank market. Unicredit allegedly evaded €245m (£198m) in tax. Mr Profumo, who was UniCredit chief executive at the time, said in a statement that he was looking forward to the trial, 'so that an end can be put to the reputational damage which I am de facto, though unjustly, suffering'. Mr Profumo, who is now the chairman of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy’s third largest lender, is accused of authorising the operation, judicial and investigative sources told news agency Reuters. In a separate statement, UniCredit said it was confident the trial would clear bank and its former and current employees. The first hearing is scheduled for October 1, Reuters reported. Boss: Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays, last month launched a drive to restore trust and burnish his bank's dented image . Barclays said it believed neither it nor any of the individuals involved had violated any laws in Italy. A spokesman said: 'Barclays takes its responsibilities as a  corporate citizen very seriously, complying with taxation laws in the UK and in all the countries where we do business. 'Barclays continues to believe firmly that it and the individuals involved have not violated any tax or other laws in Italy, and we continue to support fully the individuals named in this matter.' Campaign group . ActionAid revealed in a report last year that Barclays has 174 offshoots on the tax . haven of the Cayman Islands. And in April, it emerged that Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays, would receive millions of pounds on top of his lavish pay and bonus package to cover his tax bills. The bank was savaged for writing a 'blank cheque' to its American-born boss. Shareholders were already outraged that Barclays covered a £5.m tax bill run up by Mr Diamond last year, lifting his pay package to almost £27m. Last month, Mr Diamond launched a  'Citizenship Plan' as part of a drive to restore trust and burnish his bank's dented image – but offered no blueprint for reforming pay. The three-year plan, unveiled at the bank’s Canary Wharf headquarters, aimed to support local communities, contribute to economic growth and improve integrity and service to customers. Confident: Alessandro Profumo has said he will clear his name at trial . Under the blueprint, Barclays made commitments to lend at least £150bn to households and to provide at least £50bn to small and medium-sized firms. The bank also said it would boost apprenticeship and work experience programmes to help young unemployed people start careers. Outside of the UK it is helping micro-entrepreneurs in Africa. It has also made a commitment to draw up plans that would allow Barclays to fail without bringing down the financial system. Mr Diamond said: 'Taxpayers’ money should never again be put at risk. Ever.’ Campaigners dismissed the initiative as 'cynical PR' and 'frankly insulting' to ordinary people bearing the brunt of the financial crisis. On the issue of bankers' fat pay cheques and bonuses, Mr Diamond said: 'We recognise the scepticism and cynicism. 'Levels of pay continue to be causes of concern. 'But we believe banks have a critical role in putting things right as the private sector must take on the role of boosting economic growth.'","Milan judge orders top Italian banker Alessandro Profumo and 19 others to go on trial .

The father of Josh Powell, who killed himself and his sons after his wife went missing in mysterious circumstances, has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for voyeurism. Steven Powell will also spend three years on probation, and has been ordered to undergo a psychosexual evaluation. Prosecutors in Tacoma, Washington had asked for an exceptional sentence of 10 years. Powell's attorneys sought zero to 12 months, arguing that he might have taken the incriminating pictures before the state made voyeurism a felony in 2006. Jailed: Steve Powell, shown being led into court on Friday, has been sentenced to 30 months in prison . Hearing: Powell at today's sentencing, where he got a sentence much more lenient than prosecutors wanted . The 62-year-old was found guilty of 14 counts of voyeurism by a jury last month. He will get credit for time already served in prison, reducing his sentence to around 21 months. Powell is the father-in-law of Susan Powell, who disappeared from her home in West Valley City, Utah, in late 2009. His . son and her husband, Josh Powell, killed himself and his two young sons . in a February fire at a home in Graham. Josh Powell was the prime . suspect in Susan's disappearance. Steve Powell . was arrested last September after investigators searching his home for . evidence in Mrs Powell's disappearance came across computer disks with . what they described as thousands of images of women and girls who . seemed unaware they were being photographed. Those . filmed, prosecutors say, included neighborhood girls, who were . identified in court only by their initials and who were about eight and 10 . when the images were recorded. Victim: Evidence relating to Powell's missing daughter-in-law Susan was not allowed to be used in the trial . Family: Powell's son Josh killed himself and his two children Charlie and Braden in February this year . The mother of Powell's . victims addressed him at sentencing, trembling and tearful as she stood . with her back to him. She said she is still waiting for an apology. 'You've . sat there smugly and acted as though it's perfectly normal to have . committed your crimes,' she said. 'I'm so angry. I'm angry for the hurt . you caused my children. You caused them embarrassment and heartache' Powell, wearing a grey jail uniform, declined to speak in court. Deputy . prosecutor Grant Blinn asked for an exceptional 10-year sentence, . noting the number of offenses and that Powell not only secretly watched . the girls, but 'memorialised' his offence by recording them so he could . watch them over and over. Powell's lawyers, . Mark Quigley and Travis Currie, argued that 10 years was far beyond what . any other convicted voyeur has received in Pierce County. One other . defendant charged with similar offenses received a sentence of 261 days, . but he took responsibility for his crimes. Judge: Ronald Culpepper reviews documents during the sentencing hearing in Tacoma, Washington . Relief: Denise Cox, Susan Powell's sister, hugging a relative after the guilty verdict was read in Powell's trial last month . Mr Quigley urged Judge Ronald Culpepper to pay no mind to the intense media attention on the case. 'We . can't ignore the fact that there's intense public interest in the . outcome of this case,' he said. 'I would ask you not to punish Mr . Powell for the conduct of his son.' Before . sentencing Powell, Mr Culpepper threw out two of the 14 voyeurism . convictions, saying they appeared to be redundant - that is, Powell had . faced multiple counts based on the same recording sessions. Powell's . lawyers sought to have all but two of the counts dismissed - one count . for each victim - on the grounds that the state couldn't prove the . images were not all recorded in one long recording session on a single . day. The judge declined, saying he did not have enough evidence to overrule the jury's decision to convict him on those counts. Among the . images recovered from Powell's home were many of Susan Powell that . appeared to have been filmed without her knowledge, investigators said. There were also said to be journals in which Powell detailed his obsession . with his daughter-in-law. Much of that . evidence had been barred from the trial as unduly prejudicial against . the defendant. Powell was not charged with acts of voyeurism . involving Mrs Powell because authorities could not prove she was unaware of the filming.","Prosecution sought 10-year sentence for photographing neighbourhood girls aged eight and 10 .

A grandmother was left with shocking injuries after she was viciously attacked by a pack of sheep dogs and Jack Russells who knocked her to the ground and tore at her helpless body. Margaret Horton, 75, was just yards from the front door of her home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, when the five dogs pounced. The out-of-control animals snapped at the frail pensioner's ankles until she fell face first onto the pavement. They then savaged her legs and hands before passers-by managed to fight the dogs off. Mrs Horton, who had to spend the night in hospital after the attack, was left with grotesque bruising around her left eye and needed skin grafts to replace the torn skin on her legs. Recounting the nightmare ordeal, the grandmother-of-one said: 'It was absolutely horrendous. There was nothing I could do. 'I just felt their teeth sink into my legs. 'I was covered in blood and I can’t sleep because I am in so much pain. 'You can put two full fingers into one of the wounds because it is so deep.

She added: 'I’m normally up and about, but this has really upset me. 'I’m just glad it wasn’t a child who was attacked. 'Those dogs would have killed it.

This is the heart-stopping moment a teenage girl was filmed holding a gun to her head seconds before she turned it on police. In a frightening video troubled Kerri May Wood, 19, can be seen brandishing the firearm and pointing it towards officers in Hull. Incredibly, as shots rang out, fearless PC Carl Bugg can be seen racing towards Wood and pulling her to the ground in an act of amazing bravery. Miss Wood has since been taken to a secure mental health unit, after waving the weapon and threatening to kill herself just outside a busy police station. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scary: The teenage girl was filmed here in a busy area of Hull with a gun to her head, seconds before she turned it on police . Threat: With police surrounding her she takes it from her head and turns the weapon on them . During the incident she aimed the gun at PC Carl Bugg and pulled the trigger, firing two shots, as office workers, students from nearby Hull College and shoppers made their way home. As her bullets landed in the pond, brave PC Bugg ran in and tackled her to the ground while uniformed officers swarmed in from the bushes to help him. And yesterday PC Bugg was awarded a commendation for bravery by a judge, as his Chief Inspector Ed Cook praised the officer’s action to protect the public. He said: 'Not only was the woman in question threatening to take her life immediately but she was putting members of the public in mortal danger. Dramatic: In a flash PC Carl Bugg sprints from another direction to try to tackle Kerri May Wood . Fearless: With no concern for himself PC Bugg ploughs on into the woman, despite her turning around to point the gun at him . Over: Miss Wood is shown here thrown to the floor by the hero policeman . 'The officer put himself in harm’s way to protect others. 'He successfully disarmed the woman without causing her injury, and potentially saved lives.' Hull Crown Court heard Wood, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, armed herself with a P-25 Blowback semi-automatic air pistol in Queens Gardens. Wood was first spotted by a PCSO sitting by a pond, with her feet in the water, cradling the gun. She was sipping from a can of strong cider and had a carrier bag of alcohol. As the PCSO called for back-up, Wood jumped to her feet. In some distress, she placed the weapon to her temple and the back of her head. Disarmed: The rest of the police officers pile on top to arrest the woman, who has since been sent to a mental health unit after the incident . Seven officers, running across from the police station, surrounded her to protect the families and students in the public gardens around 5.20pm on October 20 last year. Prosecutor Jharna Jobes told the court: 'PC Bugg approaches her and tells other officers to go away. She points the gun at him and shoots. 'He said he could hear something whistling past him and the shots land in the water.' Showing no fear for his own safety, PC Bugg ran towards her and bundled her to the ground. The gun flew out of her hand, landing on the grass under a tree. Wood was restrained and placed in handcuffs at the end of the stand-off, which lasted 20 minutes. Officers then searched her bag, discovering more ammunition and a hunting knife. Wood pleaded guilty to possessing a hunting knife in Queens Gardens and possessing a firearm with intent to cause PC Bugg to believe unlawful violence would be used against him or another. Recorder Simon Jackson QC sentenced Wood to a hospital order, to undergo treatment for her mental health issues. She cannot be released until doctors believe she is safe to return to society. He also awarded PC Bugg a commendation for bravery. He said: 'PC Carl Bugg confronted the defendant when this defendant was plainly in possession of a firearm when he couldn’t have known what type of firearm it was. 'He put this incident to an end and I commend him for his bravery.' Humberside Police’s Chief Constable Tim Hollis also commended PC Bugg, saying he had shown 'tremendous courage and bravery.'","PC Carl Bugg ignores his own safety and charges into Kerri May Wood - who was waving a weapon and firing it in Hull .

Gossip Girl star Kelly Rutherford has lost residential custody of her two children to ex-husband Daniel Giersch, according to a new report. The 43-year-old actress is said to be 'devastated' after a judge ruled her five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter can remain with their father in France, where he currently resides. Rutherford was fighting the 37-year-old German businessman in family court to bring her children back to the U.S. High society role: Rutherford stars as Serena's (Blake Lively) mother Lily van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl . As TMZ reports, Giersch is unable to return to the U.S. because his visa has been revoked as of April this year. According to the website, the judge ruled Rutherford will be allowed a flexible visitation schedule so that she may spend time with her children when travel and work arrangements allow. According to the ruling, she will be permitted to see their five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter 50 per cent of the time. However Rutherford, who married Giersch back in 2006 and divorced him in 2010, plans to appeal the ruling. Happier times: Kelly Rutherford with son and then-husband Daniel Giersch in March, 2007 . Rutherford’s lawyer’s attempted to . depose Giersch, a German businessman, about his visa, back in 2010 but . at the time the judge ruled in favor of Giersch, noting that the risk of . him being deported and taking the children to Germany was 'very low.' It's unclear when Giersch took the children to France and how long Rutherford expected the visit to last. It makes for another disappointing . legal row for Rutherford, who in April was sued by a private eye . claiming he was hired to spy on Giersch. According to court documents obtained . by TMZ, the actress engaged the services of Edward Banach to spy on her . ex back in April 2010 'in relation to certain issues regarding child . custody and other matters'. Handover: Rutherford, right, takes her daughter from Giersch's arms in April 2010 . The website reports the pair went . through a messy divorce, with issues of 'restraining orders and . allegations of child endangerment'. Banach alleges he spent months snooping on Giersch's ex, which left Rutherford with a whopping bill of $86,249.85. However, he alleges he only got paid $28,214.35, leaving bills of around $58,000 unpaid. Now, Banach - who was sub-contracted . through a now-defunct security company - is suing the business along . with Rutherford to get the remaining $58,000. According to TMZ, at the height of . their legal disputes, Rutherford admitted she hired a private . investigator to prove Giersch  'did not properly secure the pool and . play areas at his home,' which she alleges endangered the couple's young . son. The warring pair also previously argued over . 'potty-training' their son and the actress’s ex claimed he was never . notified of the birth, and instead read about it in online reports. He put out a statement soon after the . birth that said: 'I was never informed by Kelly about the birth of our . daughter, nor was I invited to attend. Working mom: Rutherford was all smiles in June 2010 when out and about with her brood . 'In fact, I found out about it . through Internet reports like everyone else.

A team of specially-trained U.S. commandos infiltrated North Korea in a spy mission focused on the regime’s nuke program, according to a controversial report that the U.S. military denies. The allegations are sure to stoke already sensitive tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. According to a report yesterday in The Diplomat, Brigadier Gen Neil H. Tolley acknowledged that U.S. and South Korean special forces have parachuted into the North to get a closer look at underground military tunnels the regime has constructed. Fact or fiction? The U.S. military has sent special forces into North Korea in secret parachuting missions, according to a report that the U.S. military denies . Statement: Brigadier Gen Neil H. Tolley, right, was quoted as saying that U.S. commandos have parachuted into the North for a closer look at military tunnels the regime has constructed . 'The entire tunnel infrastructure is hidden from our satellites,' the online magazine reported Gen Tolley as saying at a Florida press conference last week. 'So we send [South Korean] soldiers and U.S. soldiers to the North to do special reconnaissance.' If true, the mission would break rules set in place by the 1953 armistice agreement that marked the end of the Korean War. A portion of the document states: 'No person, military or civilian, shall be permitted to cross the military demarcation line unless specifically authorized to do so by the Military Armistice Commission.' Violation: If true, the mission would break rules set in place by the armistice agreement that marked the end of the Korean War, which prohibit soldiers or civilians from crossing into North Korea . Gen Tolley is the commanding general of the Special Operations Command, United State Forces Korea, according to a biography on the National Guard website. The report in the Japan-based online magazine was met with strong opposition in Washington, where U.S. military officials denied such an operation ever took place. As news of the alleged reconnaissance mission spread, United States Forces Korea spokesman Col Jonathan Withington, disputed the report. Leader: Kim Jong Un rose to power in North Korea following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December . In a statement, Col Withington said: 'Quotes have been made up and attributed to [Gen Tolley]. No U.S. or [South Korean] forces have parachuted into North Korea.' Today, The Diplomat, which has since removed the article from its site, issued a clarification of the original report: . ‘In response to the controversy that has attended yesterday's story on North Korea, The Diplomat has sought corroboration. ‘While the author strongly disputes the contention that any quote was fabricated, we acknowledge the possibility that Brig Gen Tolley was speaking hypothetically, about future war plans rather than current operations. AFP reported that the writer of the piece, David Axe, stood by the story, telling the agency that if the general was speaking hypothetically, 'he did not say so.' Mr Axe added that Gen Tolley 'spoke in the present tense' and 'at length.' For observers of North Korea, little has changed since the death of longtime rule Kim Jong Il in December, and his son Kim Jong Un’s rise to power. 'None,' said Andrei Lankov, a scholar on the North at Seoul's Kookmin University, when asked if he had seen signs of significant change since December. Lankov said: 'The young dictator is still controlled and surrounded by the old guard, the same people who for many years formulated and executed his father's polices, so it is too early to expect any noticeable change.'","Controversial report says soldiers parachuted into North Korea to gather intelligence about underground tunnels .

The pair have been close friends for almost two years, but recently their relationship has developed into something deeper. The singer confirmed this week: ‘Storm and I have been friends for some time and that has recently evolved into something more serious. We are both really happy.’ New love: Ronan Keating and Storm Uechtritz have started a new relationship . Keating and the television producer became close when they met on the set of the Australian X Factor in June 2010. Just one month earlier, news of . Ronan’s affair with backing dancer Francine Cornell had broken, putting a . huge strain on the singer’s marriage. And while his wife Yvonne spent that . summer in Australia with the couple’s three children, Jack, 13, Missy, . 11, and Ali, seven, Ronan and Storm remained close friends. A source on the show said: ‘Wherever Ronan went on the set, Storm went. ‘They hung out together all the time. ‘After the show, Ronan would go back and meet Yvonne and the children. Salvage attempt: Ronan and his ex-wife Yvonne at Bondi Beach in Sydney in October 2010 . ‘But on the set, Ronan and Storm just hung out and chatted and laughed. They were very close.’ In fact, the amount of time they spent . together during filming of the first series sparked speculation as to . the nature of their relationship. Then in November, Storm suddenly left . the show to join the production team at Masterchef Australia. She worked . on that programme for 10 months and last October she was hired as a . producer on The Voice of Australia, a rival show to Ronan’s X Factor. ‘Ronan was definitely sad to see her go,’ added the source. Storm on her wedding day in 2009, left, and indulging her sweet tooth - a habit she is said to share with Ronan . ‘But they kept in touch, with Storm sending him notes on his performance and just meeting for coffee.’ When the X Factor wrapped in January 2011 and Ronan returned to Ireland, the pair kept in contact. At the time, Ronan and Yvonne were still trying to save their marriage for the sake of the children. But sources believe that as early as . March 2011 the couple were struggling to put the Cornell affair behind . them.At the same time, Ronan and Storm were constantly in touch through . phone calls, texts and emails. And that March she made the trip from Sydney to London to party with Ronan for his birthday. However, when Ronan realised that . Yvonne was also attending the London party, Storm decided not  to attend . the bash, opting instead to meet Ronan the day after he had celebrated . on March 3. ‘It was just decided that Yvonne was . making the effort to be there for Ronan and it wouldn’t be fair to have . Storm there as well,’ said a band source. Family unit: Ronan has three children with his estranged wife although both seemed to have moved on with new loves . ‘The rest of Boyzone was there as well . and it just made sense not to have an Australian blonde girl sitting . with him when Yvonne walked in. As far as I know, Yvonne was not aware . of Ronan’s friendship with Storm.’ By June 2011, it became clear that the . differences between Ronan and Yvonne were irreconcilable and the couple . began to accept that their marriage was over for good. By February 2012, Yvonne had finally put the affair behind her and had begun to date cameraman John Conroy. A friend of Ronan’s new partner said: . ‘They have loads in common – both are into keeping fit, music, good food . and wine – and there is a real spark between them. For the first time . in months, Ronan has a real spring in his step and although they’re . still in the early stages, both think this could be something long . term.’ A friend of Storm’s added: ‘Those . close to Storm have known for some time about her and Ronan, and . everyone’s delighted for her.’ The ex-Boyzone star announced the . separation from his wife of 14 years just five months ago. Yvonne is . said to have been irreparably heartbroken by the revelations that her . husband had cheated. News of Ronan’s affair with backing . dancer Francine Cornell emerged two years ago when his wife found . incriminating text messages on a secret mobile phone. The couple attempted to work through their problems but finally announced their divorce in April. Ironically, it has emerged that Storm, . who married Sydney financial director Tim Ivers in a beachside ceremony . in August 2009, shared her first dance with Ivers to Keating’s hit . song, You Say It Best. Friends said Ivers was ‘a lovely guy’ whose . separation had come as a huge shock.",Boyzone star grew close to blonde during marital split .

Jeffrey MacDonald, now 68, could be granted a new trial at the end of a two-week hearing at federal court in Wilmington, North Carolina. If not, then his next chance at freedom will be in 2020 when he is up for parole. He is serving three life sentences for the beating and fatal stabbing of his pregnant wife Colette and two daughters Kimberly and Kristen in their home at Fort Bragg on February 17, 1970. Developments: Jeffrey MacDonald in 1970 (left) after being charged with his wife and two daughters' murders. He has always proclaimed his innocence and is back in court on new DNA evidence, aged 68 (right) Jeffrey MacDonald's wife Kathryn, who he married while in prison in 2002, told ABC: 'People are finally hearing what he has been saying for the past 33 years.' The defense's case involves DNA from foreign hair . fibers found in the family's home and statements from a deputy U.S. marshal and witness, both now deceased. The brother of Helena Stoeckley, who . was a key witness in the 1979 murder trial, told the court on Tuesday . that his sister confessed she had been at MacDonald's home on the night his . family were murdered. She died in 1983. MacDonald has always maintained . that he awoke on a sofa at home as three men attacked his family and . a woman, wearing a blonde wig and a floppy hat, chanted 'acid is . groovy, kill the pigs'. Stoeckley - a known drug addict - repeatedly said out of court that she had been at the home. However she testified in court that she didn't remember where she was that night. Support: Kathryn MacDonald (left) who married the convicted murderer in 2002 leaves the hearing in Wilmington today and MacDonald's attorney Wade Smith (right) Fresh hope: A car carrying convicted murderer Jeffrey MacDonald leaves federal courthouse in Wilmington, North Carolina . Prosecutors quizzed Eugene Stoeckley suggesting that his sister had told many people that she was in the house that evening. Testimony on Monday focused on the sworn affidavit of the late Marshal Jimmy Britt who had  polygraph test. Lifetime in prison: Jeffrey MacDonald has been incarcerated for almost 40 years over the deaths of his wife and daughters . He came forward in 2005  because 'he wanted to unload his heart . and his soul', according to defense Wade Smith. Britt had driven Helena Stoeckley from county jail in 1979 for questioning prior to MacDonald's murder trial . She allegedly told him she had been in the house on the night of the murders and provided details about the house, including the presence of a hobby horse. Prosecutors discounted these remarks saying that pictures of the home's interior had appeared in a local newspaper. Britt's statement said he heard Stoeckley then repeat to U.S. Attorney James Blackburn what she had told him in the car. It is alleged that Blackburn told Stoeckley he would indict her for murder if she testified that she had been in the MacDonald home. Blackburn, who later went into private practice, was disbarred and served a prison sentence for ethical violations. He is expected to be called as a witness. DNA evidence - which was not available at the time of the murders - also showed three hairs found in the home on the night of the killings did not belonging to any family member. Those who believe MacDonald committed . the killings have said the hairs could have come from anyone - . neighbors or other people who had visited the home.

The word 'pig' was written in blood on a headboard at the MacDonald home; the same was on the door of pregnant Manson victim Sharon Tate's house in Los Angeles. The crime became the basis of Joe McGinniss' best-selling book Fatal Vision and a made-for-TV drama.

"By . Ted Thornhill . UPDATED: . 04:34 EST, 1 December 2011 . One of the rarest events in the universe has been seen by scientists for the first time. A stunning cosmic jet from a super-massive black hole which shredded then swallowed a star has been observed by astronomers. Known as 'relativistic jets', they can reach hundreds of thousands of light years in length. The swallowing of a star by a black hole only happens once every one hundred million years in a galaxy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stunning: This illustration shows plasma shooting out of the black hole after it devours a star. Such an event took place four billion light years from Earth . Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical (white, purple) and X-ray telescopes (yellow and red) showing the bursts . Most galaxies have super-massive black holes - regions of space that suck in everything nearby with their strong gravitation pull - at their core, with masses of millions or even billions of suns. Scientists were first alerted to the . phenomenon in March after Nasa's Swift telescope detected several bursts . of X-rays from a quiet patch of sky. Teams from both Pennsylvania State University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in . Cambridge, Massachusetts, said the bursts could be the remnants of a star pulled apart when it came too close to a black hole located 3.9billion light years away. As a star falls toward a black hole, it is ripped apart by intense . tides. The gas is corralled into an accretion disk that swirls around . the black hole and becomes rapidly heated to temperatures of millions of . degrees. The innermost gas in the disk spirals toward the black hole, . where rapid motion and magnetism create dual, oppositely directed 'funnels' through which some particles may escape. Jets driving matter . at velocities greater than 90 percent the speed of light form along the . black hole's spin axis. In the case of Swift J1644+57, one of these jets . happened to point straight at Earth. Dr David Burrows, from Pennsylvania State University which controls Swift, said chemical analysis of the bright flash's ultraviolet light show it comes from material being sucked into a black hole the size of a million suns. Writing in Nature, they concluded that the Swift satellite just happened to be in the path of the jet of star remains that were shot out at 99.5 per cent the speed of light. Dr Burrows said: 'Incredibly, this source is still producing X-rays and may remain bright . enough for the Swift satellite to observe into next year. It behaves . unlike anything we've seen before.' The black hole is now believed to be even more powerful because of the additional mass from the swallowed star. The absorption of large mass such as stars or even other black holes is what gives black holes growth and spawn the existence of super-massive black holes.Super-massive black holes could contain up to billions of solar masses. By comparison, the sun is just one solar mass and the Earth is 1/332,950th of a solar mass. Black holes are probably the strangest cosmic phenomenon that we know about. Their gravity is so strong that normal laws of physics just don't apply, with time actually slowing down at a black hole's event horizon - the point at which it would be impossible to escape its clutches.","Astronomers watch as Nasa telescope captures rare event .

Atlanta Falcons running back Michael Turner was hit with drunken driving charges right after his team defeated the Denver Broncos during their Monday Night Football contest. Turner was jailed on charges of DUI and speeding early Tuesday - hours after he scored a touchdown in the team's win over Denver. Turner, 30, of Suwanee, Georgia, was booked into the Gwinnett County jail in metro Atlanta just after 5am. He spent barely two hours behind bars before he was released on $2,179 bond, jail records showed. A Gwinnett County police officer pulled over Turner's black Audi R8 on Interstate 85 northeast of Atlanta after clocking the car's speed at 97 mph - 32 mph over the speed limit, said Cpl Edwin Ritter, a police spokesman. 'The officer made contact with the driver who identified himself as 30-year-old Michael Turner of the Atlanta Falcons,' Ritter said in a news release. 'The officer could smell an odor of alcoholic beverage coming from the driver and proceeded to conduct a DUI investigation.' No other details were immediately available. Hours before his arrest, Turner and the Falcons celebrated a 27-21 home victory over Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos.

Arrest: Police in East Baton Rouge have arrested William Bouvay, 42, for making a bomb threat to the Louisiana State University's campus this week . An arrest has been made in the bomb threat that led to the evacuation of the LSU campus earlier this week while police don't believe he is connected to threats made against three other universities. William Bouvay Jr., 42, of Baton Rouge was arrested on late Tuesday night after an investigation by multiple law enforcement agencies linked a cell phone having made the call to his neighbourhood, police report. LSU Police Capt. Corey Lalonde said Bouvay was not an LSU student and appeared to have no connection to the campus. His Facebook profile depicts him as a religious man who became engaged earlier this year. Capt Lalonde did not know what the suspect's motive might have been. Investigators don't think Bouvay is connected to threats made last week at college campuses in Texas, North Dakota and Ohio. 'We don't believe at this point that there is any connection to the bomb threats at other universities,' Capt Lalonde said. He said police tracked Bouvay down after determining the 911 call received Monday at 10.32 am CDT came from a deactivated cell phone that could only make emergency calls. Motive: Bouvay was never an LSU student and appeared to have no connection to the campus with a motive for the bomb scare currently unknown . Personal details: Bouvay's Facebook photo is seen on his page which claims him being engaged to be married though little more about the suspect shown . Capt Lalonde said investigators were . able to pinpoint the location of the cell phone on Tuesday and searched . homes in the Baton Rouge neighbourhood before identifying Bouvay as a . suspect. 'Upon questioning, he admitted to making the phone call,' Capt Lalonde said, adding that Bouvay has been cooperative. Authorities said he will be charged with communicating false information of a planned bombing. The threat set into motion a massive evacuation of the sprawling campus that sparked traffic jams as thousands left. The caller didn't specify where on campus bombs might be planted, so bomb-squad officers with explosives-sniffing dogs were called in to search all buildings. Closure: LSUPD spokesman Cory Lalonde is seen during a press conference on Wednesday, one day after classes resumed at the university and hours after an arrest was made . Efforts: Officers with a dog talk after searching one of the buildings on the LSU campus which had to be searched one-by-one with the bomb threat's caller not specifying a potential location . As with the threats made last week at the University of Texas, North Dakota State University and Hiram College, the search failed to turn up explosives. Capt Lalonde said authorities believe Bouvay is the person who called the East Baton Rouge Parish 911 Center, claiming multiple bombs would detonate on campus within two hours. The university was upbeat before Monday's threat after LSU rose to No. 2 in The Associated Press college football poll with a win over Idaho on Saturday. Evacuation: Students are seen waiting for buses to take them off campus during the evacuation of an estimated 30,000 students, professors and employees . Officials believe a majority of the university's 30,000 students, professors and employees were on campus when the threat was made. Students were allowed to return to dormitories late Monday night and classes resumed on Tuesday. An estimated 6,000 students live on campus. Interim LSU President William Jenkins said he's pleased at how swiftly a suspect was identified and apprehended, but doesn't know why Bouvay targeted LSU. 'I'm very proud of our resilience, as disruptive and as harmful as this episode was. We're back at work and once again we're a productive, thriving university,' he said.","William Bouvay Jr., 42, of Baton Rouge was arrested on late Tuesday night .

Thousands of striking Chicago public school teachers and their allies packed a city park Saturday in a boisterous show of force as union leaders and the district tried to work out the details of an agreement that could end a week-long walkout. Pushing strollers, toting signs and towing wagons of children, thousands of red-shirted teachers cheered and chanted as speaker after speaker urged them to stand firm until they have a deal in writing. They told the teachers that their strike was a symbol of hope for public teachers and other unions that have been losing ground around the nation. Scroll down for video . Raging mad: Striking Chicago school teachers march after a rally Saturday, wearing posters and carrying signs . Riled up: Karen Lewis, president of the Chicago Teachers Union addresses the crowd during a rally . Stand strong: Lewis cautioned that 'we are on strike' and that classes won't resume until the delegates see an agreement they can support . 'I'm pretty confident that something will come together that both sides will agree on,' said Ramses James, a sixth-grade math teacher. 'I believe this is a very strong turning point when you have so many people coming out to fight alongside (the teachers union). That means a lot.' Months of contract negotiations came down to two main issues: job security and union opposition to a new teacher evaluation process the union felt was too heavily weighted on student test scores. Union leaders who announced a framework for a deal on Friday said they would not end the strike - the first in Chicago in 25 years - until they see a proposal in writing. Saturday's talks were aimed at settling on the exact language, and both sides were hopeful that the nearly 800-member House of Delegates could vote Sunday to suspend the strike so children could be back in class on Monday. Addressing demonstrators Saturday, Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis cautioned that 'we are on strike' and that classes won't resume until the delegates see an agreement they can support. The Rev. Jesse Jackson also addressed the crowd, saying the strike was a 'struggle for working people everywhere' and that there was still a long road to ensuring all residents of the city have equal access to quality schools, especially in neighborhoods beset by gang violence and poverty. The mission: Months of negotiations came down to two main issues: job security and union opposition to a new teacher evaluation process the union felt was too heavily weighted on test scores . Go get it: Residents of a west side Chicago neighborhood cheer public school teachers as they march after the rally . 'Our mission is very clear: we fight for equal, high-quality public education for all,' Jackson said. 'When school opens again there will be 160 schools without a public library. ... When school opens again, there will be schools yet without books. So we fight today for schools on the South and West Side to look like schools on the North Side.' Saturday's talks took place at the offices of union attorney Robert Bloch. On his way into the talks, Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jesse Sharkey was optimistic that timetable was still possible. 'We're hopeful that we can do it but frankly like I said, the devil is in the details of this contract and we want it in writing,' he told reporters. 'We're going to go in today and hammer (out) the details.' Union members from Wisconsin, Minnesota and elsewhere joined Saturday's rally in show of solidarity. For Wisconsin teachers, the rally also served as a moment to celebrate a judge's Friday ruling striking down nearly all of a contentious state law championed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker that had effectively ended collective bargaining rights for most public workers. Raging mad:  A young boy, left, and a woman, right, hold signs critical of Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel . Walker's administration immediately vowed to appeal, while unions, which have vigorously fought the law, declared victory. 'People are energized by this,' said Marty Horning a high school social studies teacher from Milwaukee who came to the rally with a busload of others. 'I think that the line has to be drawn in terms of teacher bashing, union bashing and privatization of education. These forces and factors are not just in Chicago, not just in Wisconsin, but across the nation and (Chicago) happens to be the spear point.' Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has blasted the union for engaging in a 'strike of choice,' sounded optimistic Friday, saying 'the tentative framework is an honest and principled compromise that is about who we all work for: the students.' The walkout in the nation's third-largest school district canceled five days of class for more than 350,000 public school students who had just returned from summer vacation. Until this week, Chicago teachers had not walked out since 1987, when they were on strike for 19 days.","Teachers in Chicago on week-long walkout over contract disputes .

When they never returned home, hundreds of volunteers spent the weekend looking for the girls, and their bikes were found next to Meyers Lake. Scroll down for video . Missing: Eight-year-old Elizabeth Collins, left, and 10-year-old Lyric Cook disappeared while riding their bikes not far from Elizabeth's home in Evansdale, Iowa . Desperate search: Authorities look for possible evidence at Meyers Lake where Lyric Cook-Morrissey, 10, and Elizabeth Collins, 8, disappeared last Friday . More than 350 . volunteers joined the search over the weekend. Teams have been dragging the lake for the past several days but have found nothing. Local authorities are cooperating with the FBI and it appears the mounting pressure and unimaginable loss has taken its toll on the family. 'You tell them the truth and they say, ""You're holding something back,"" and you're not. What is left to talk about? You know, we go over and over and over again,' he told KCCI. 'It made me feel like, ""Yeah, they're looking at me like a suspect.""' Daniel Morrissey's wife, Misty Morrissey, told ABC News that the family has been completely accessible to law enforcement and want to do everything in their power to help the investigation. 'We've done extensive interviews, hours at a time, we've done polygraphs, we have taken many phone calls, answered many questions,' she said. 'We've given our phones up, all of our data has been, you know, taken off of our phones. In fact, my sister['s] and my phone is now not, our touch screens aren't working very well. So we've cooperated to the fullest.' A spokesman from Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office said it would take another several days at least for the lake to be fully drained and that the family has complied diligently to all requests made of them. FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault said . the reaction from the dogs on Monday night indicated a 'strong . possibility' the girls had been at the lake, less than a mile from their . grandmother's house where they were last seen on Friday. However, Breault said because there were no confirmed sightings at the lake, authorities could not be certain. Close: The girls, pictured in 2009, often spent the day together when Lyric's mother was at work . 'I'm worried that so many days have gone by [and] we haven't found anything and no evidence has come up,' Misty Morrissey said. 'The more time that passes, the greater chances that they are not alive or the further away that they might be getting.' Chief Deputy Rick Abben of the Black . Hawk County Sheriff's Office said the case was still considered a . missing persons investigation. The decision to drain the lake was made to rule out the possibility the girls were in the water, he said. Breault said the search has been slowed because of the time required to drain the lake. The draining began Monday afternoon and could take up to three days. A father's agony: Dan Morrissey leans on a tree near Meyers Lake where his daughter Lyric and her cousin Elizabeth Collins disappeared . The lake is draining through a 3-foot . culvert with a grate over it that would prevent a body from flowing . into it, Abben said. A pump was brought in on Tuesday to quicken the . pace. Collecting evidence: Law enforcement officials and search volunteers have focused on Meyers Lake in search of the girls . A group of three officers walking along the southeast shoreline stopped to study something that appeared to be a cup. An officer with gloves and an evidence bag picked it up and took it back to a patrol car sitting along the bank. Officials didn't . identify the object or even confirm whether it was related to the search . for the girls but it was a . rare sign of activity in a massive search that has produced few if any . significant leads. Dan Morrissey, Lyric's father, told the Associated Press: 'I don't think that they're . in the lake, not at all but it is just like a dead end as far as we know . so far.' He added: 'We've never gone through . anything like this. It's hard enough just to get up and deal with the . reality that your daughter is gone.' Family members were still hopeful . that the girls would be found safe, despite investigators admitting that . had no new clues as to their whereabouts. Chief Deputy Abben said authorities were interviewing family and friends of the girls in hopes that they might shed some light on the girls' behaviour and state of mind before their disappearance. Tammy Brousseau, 48, an aunt to both of the girls, said all the signs were pointing to a stranger - possibility a pedophile - who may have abducted them from the area where the bikes were found. Brousseau said that just last week she taught Lyric how to 'save someone if they went limp in the water.' She said she also taught both girls how to 'drop to the ground and fight' if someone tried to abduct them. Mom and dad: Lyric's parents Misty and Dan Morrissey say they don't suspect a drowning, noting the girls' swimming abilities and the fact that no shoes were recovered on the bank of the lake . Lyric's parents said they didn't suspect a drowning either, noting the girls' swimming abilities and the fact that no shoes were recovered on the bank of the lake. Dan Morrissey said: 'The area where the bikes were found is fenced on both sides, and it is right where [a] maintenance gate is. It is a spot that looks to me like a trap. 'Somebody could have just come along right then or followed them down it would have been the worst spot to be in right there.' Search: More than 350 volunteers came Saturday to help search Deerwood Park for the two missing girls . Local support: Volunteer Earl Conerd searches debris around Meyers Lake. But, despite a large turn-out of volunteers, police say they have not found any evidence that would point them to the girls' whereabouts . Registered sex offenders in the are are also being interviewed. The mothers of both girls said they were trying to stay strong as the search dragged on. Misty Cook-Morrissey said: . 'Sometimes, when you think about it, you wonder if they're dead . somewhere, but you try to push those thoughts out of your mind.' Search: This poster was issued to complement rescue efforts by around 400 officials and volunteers . The girls were being looked after by . their grandmother Wilma Cook on Friday when they decided to take a cycle . ride to the nearby lake. Mrs Morrissey alerted authorities when the . girls had not returned home by 3pm. Despite the mystery surrounding their disappearance, police do not believe the girls are victims of a crime. Mr Abben said: 'At this time it's still a missing persons case. There's no indication of foul play.'

Environmental groups reacted with dismay today after a minister indicated that the green belt was only safe ‘for now’. The comment by Nick Boles, on his first Commons outing as planning minister, will increase fears that the Government is looking at relaxing rules on building on the green belt. Mr Boles was told by Stuart Andrew MP, a former councillor, about threats to the green belt around Leeds. 'Safe for now': The comment by Nick Boles, on his first Commons outing as planning minister, will increase fears that the Government could relax rules . He replied: ‘I can reassure him, for now, that there is nothing to stop Leeds City Council from maintaining the protection of green belt land in their local plan.’ Shaun Spiers, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘We could have hoped for much stronger defence of the green belt than the minister gave in Parliament.’ In the same debate, Mr Boles, who has described countryside campaigners as ‘hysterical, scaremongering latter-day Luddites’, refused to answer a question on George Osborne’s views on development in his Tatton constituency. Labour’s Bill Esterson said the Chancellor was opposed to the development of 1,500 homes in his constituency at the ‘so-called Wilmslow Vision’. Disappointment: Environmental groups reacted with dismay today after Mr Boles indicated that the green belt was only safe 'for now' (file picture) He added: ‘Yet for the rest of the country he is quite content to see wide-scale development of the green belt. Can you answer me, do you think the Chancellor is a nimby?’ 'I can reassure him, for now, that there is nothing to stop Leeds City Council from maintaining the protection of green belt land in their local plan' Planning minister Nick Boles . Mr Boles replied: ‘I hope you will forgive me if I duck that last question. I am very happy to clarify the position and it is very simple, which is there are certain sites within the green belt that are currently brownfield and it is important and right for local authorities to try and bring those forward for development.’ Mr Boles, whose father Sir Jack Boles was head of the National Trust from 1975 to 1983, lives in a 19th century cottage in his constituency of Grantham and Stamford which overlooks acres of fields and woods. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman denied there were plans to make it easier to build on the green belt.","Environmental activists angered by planning minister .

Taking sugary snacks off supermarket checkouts could help combat child obesity, a leading scientist has suggested. Lord Krebs said the rise in the number of people who are overweight and obese in recent years was ‘staggering’ and required tougher intervention than just encouraging healthy eating. The incoming president of the British Science Association president and former chair of the Food Standards Agency said having an array of sweet treats at children's eye-level at supermarket checkouts was ‘totally inappropriate’. Changes: Taking sugary snacks off supermarket checkouts could help combat child obesity, a leading scientist has suggested . The peer said soft policy ‘nudges’ would not solve the obesity crisis alone, and called for tougher restrictions on food marketing and advertising. He praised a recent move in Australia to only sell cigarettes in plain packaging and proposals to sell them only under the counter, saying smoking and obesity required tough regulation. ‘In the case of obesity [we need] more regulation of the food industry to prevent them in their quest, in which they are immensely successful, of distilling fat, salt and sugar into perfect little gems we are all happy to eat’, he told the British Science Festival in Aberdeen. ‘They are very good at promoting it particularly to children. When I was shopping at Marks & Spencer in the centre of Oxford I was completely struck by, at this level above the ground, all the little kiddies’ sweeties lined up there. Rise: Lord Krebs said the rise in the number of people who are overweight and obese in recent years was 'staggering' ‘It’s clearly totally inappropriate for businesses to be able to do that. It’s directly marketing to three year old kids things that they shouldn’t be encouraged to eat large quantities of.’ In a speech today he will say there is ‘no magic bullet’ for tackling obesity, but scientists were generally agreed that while exercise is important, reducing calorie intake is the best way to lose weight. Low level intervention such as information about healthy eating; and what he called middle-rung measures including publishing salt and fat content on packets would not be enough, he said. One Government initiative known as the Great Swapathon involved encouraging people to buy healthier products such as fruit and vegetables with supermarket discount vouchers. However he said there was evidence that families simply used the money they saved to buy more unhealthy food. He said: ‘The Swapathon is part of the Government's wider initiative of inviting the food industry to help to tackle obesity on a voluntary basis. ‘The problem with this, as a food industry director said to the Select Committee, 'any business is in business to make money and opportunities to influence behaviour will be taken if they are a means to selling more products'.’ The Government has set up a Behavioural Insights Team - also known as the ‘Nudge Unit’ - to find ways of discreetly altering human behaviour by persuasion such as paying fines on time. But Lord Krebs that this kind of policy was not strong enough to address major problems such as obesity or unsustainable consumption which required ‘a shove rather than a nudge’. During his chairmanship of the Food Standards Agency, Krebs criticised the organic food movement, saying that people buying such food were 'not getting value for money.’ Yesterday he said the rate of overweight and obese children had doubled in two decades, with major implications for health which would put a huge burden on the healthcare system. He said: ‘It is easy to describe the cause of obesity.   We live in an environment in which delicious, affordable calories are more readily available and in which our lifestyles have become more sedentary than ever before in our evolutionary history, and our body’s inbuilt regulatory mechanisms are simply not equipped to cope. ‘It is much less easy to see how whole populations, not just in this country, but all over the globe, can be persuaded to change their behavior by eating less and/or exercising more… the central challenge is to find ways of getting populations as a whole to change their behaviour. ‘ .",Lord Krebs said having an array of sweet treats at children's eye-level at supermarket checkouts was 'totally inappropriate'

The Chinese police chief who exposed the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood and then tried to defect to the US, has gone on trial in China. The case of Wang Lijun - who is charged with defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking - is being held behind closed doors amid tight security in Chengdu, the western Chinese city to which he fled in February and handed over sensitive information about Heywood’s grisly death to US consulate officials. His dramatic flight for freedom lead to the downfall of powerful politician Bo Xilai and the conviction of Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, who was last month handed a suspended death sentence for poisoning 41-year-old Heywood over a business dispute. Trial: Chinese police chief Wang Lijun (left), who exposed the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood (right) and then tried to defect to the US . The scandal has thrown the ruling Communist Party’s carefully choreographed once-in-decade power transition into disarray. 'The . hearing was closed according to Chinese law because it involves state . secrets. The trial has two parts, private and public. Tuesday . is the private part because it involves state secrets - it was about . the two charges of defection and bending the law for his own ends,” said . Wang’s lawyer, Wang Yuncai, who declined to elaborate on case details. Wang, 52, is the former mafia-busting cop and right hand man of popular party secretary Bo Xilai. Wang's dramatic flight for freedom lead to the downfall of politician Bo Xilai and the conviction of Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, who was handed a suspended death sentence for poisoning 41-year-old Heywood . The pair ruled with an iron fist over the western Chinese mega city of Chongqing and enjoyed national fame together. But their relationship imploded late last year after the death of Heywood and the erratic behaviour of Bo’s wife Gu, who with the help of her orderly killed the Briton with a cyanide-laced drink following a business dispute. Prosecutors in her trial claimed she conferred with Wang before murdering Heywood and reported back to him afterwards. Wang then fled with details of the murder and pleaded for protection from the US after falling out with Bo earlier this year. But he was persuaded after 30 hours of what was fast becoming an embarrassing diplomatic dispute to hand himself over to Chinese armed police who had surrounded the consulate. Guards stand in a shop next to the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court where the trial is being held behind closed doors amid tight security . British officials have been criticised for not acting sooner on the information handed to them by the US about Wang’s murder file. 'We made every effort to establish whether additional information existed,'  a spokesman for the British Embassy said. What is certain is that Heywood’s murder would likely never have been investigated had Wang not fled to the US consulate and Bo Xilai would still be in line for a seat on China's most powerful political body, the standing committee of the Politburo. Rumours: China's leader in waiting, Xi Jinping was not seen in public for two weeks . Earlier Chinese state media reported the evidence against Wang was 'concrete and abundant', shorthand for his fate has already been decided by the government, which runs the country’s courts. Several other policemen accused in covering up Heywood's murder have already been jailed for long sentences and defector Wang could face the death penalty if found guilty. His trial is a next step for China’s leadership in its attempt to move past the scandal and deal with Bo, the revered son of a revolutionary veteran who has a web of political contacts and allies, including generals in the country’s all-powerful military. But China’s rulers appear divided over how to deal with him – he remains under house arrests-  and the scandal’s fallout continues to dog the leadership transition. A date for the party congress to install the new leadership has yet be announced, though it is expected to held in mid- to late October. Many experts believe the infighting in some way explained the prolonged absence of leader in waiting, Xi Jinping. Xi was not seen in public for two weeks and had cancelled high level meetings which sparked rumours about his health. The government refused to say why he was absent and he reappeared at the weekend. Many believe he has been behind the scenes attempting to appease factions within the top echelons of the secretive government.","Trial being held behind closed doors amid tight security .

"PUBLISHED: . 17:51 EST, 19 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:02 EST, 20 September 2012 . Autumn could be arriving later this year, experts said after receiving fewer reports of ripe berries and turning leaves than by the same time last year. The Woodland Trust’s Nature’s Calendar project, which gathers records of the changing seasons from members of the public, has received far fewer sightings of ripe blackthorn, bramble and elderberries so far this year than in 2011. Sightings of ripe brambles and blackthorn are both down around four-fifths on this time last year. A lack of berry sightings by the public suggests autumn is running late this year . Children will have to wait a little longer before the can go out picking ripe brambles this summer . The presence of elderberries normally indicates the first signs of autumn . There have been just 17 reports of beech trees beginning to change colour, compared to 302 for the same time last year, and only six reports of the first tinting of oak leaves, down from 125 at this point in 2011. Silver birches also appear to be turning later, with 35 reports of leaves beginning to change colour compared to 313 this time last year. And there has been just one report of winter visitor the fieldfare arriving, whereas there were a dozen sightings by the same date in 2011. The Woodland Trust said the arrival of . autumn colour varies from year to year as it is affected by temperature . and rainfall, but suggested autumn as a whole was getting later as . warmer temperatures mean trees grow for longer. It . is too early to say whether autumn will be later than the average this . year, but it already appears to be lagging behind last autumn, which was . exceptionally early, Nature’s Calendar project manager Dr Kate . Lewthwaite said. Yet to come: Autumn colours in full bloom at Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire . She said: 'We would definitely expect fruiting to be late because fruiting is intrinsically tied in with flowering, which was late because we had a washout spring which was much cooler than normal, and how were pollinating insects going to get out there. 'All of these things we would expect to have an effect, and we might expect there to be later and less fruit.' Unlike last year’s dry conditions, the wet summer this year and recent warm temperatures means the trees are not shedding their leaves so early, she said. 'Tinting is a little bit late, as we would expect.' Experts from the Royal Horticultural Society have predicted that, when it does arrive, the weather conditions over recent months mean it will be a perfect autumn for colour. Dr Lewthwaite urged people to get out and enjoy woods this autumn, and said they could help experts understand how plants and animals are adapting to the changing environment by recording their sightings on Nature’s Calendar.","Sightings of ripe blackthorn, bramble and elderberries are down compared to this time last year .

"By . Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 20:17 EST, 19 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:17 EST, 19 September 2012 . Towns and villages that oppose the building of wind-farms will be ‘bribed’ into accepting them with an offer of lower energy bills, the Energy Secretary has said. Ed Davey is trying to diffuse a groundswell of local opposition to the building of wind farms in the countryside. He announced yesterday that communities that accept the building of wind-farms nearby will be rewarded with lower energy bills or amenities like children’s playgrounds. Wind farm developers could contribute to 'community funds' to help placate angry campaigners . But campaigners accused him of using ‘bribes’ to throw the planning process and split communities. There are currently 3,350 onshore wind turbines, and his department will have to build around 10,000 more by 2020 to meet green targets. The move will draw battlelines with the 105 Tory MPs, who wrote to David Cameron earlier this year calling for a halt to the march of unsightly and ‘inefficient’ turbines, and cuts to the subsidies paid to developers. In a call for evidence, Mr Davey suggests giving communities money off their bills, or grants for local amenities such as playgrounds, environmental projects, sports facilities or tourist attractions. Some wind farm developers, mainly in Scotland, already contribute to ‘community funds.’ It is now suggested this could become common practice in a bid to tackle angry campaigners. The idea was proposed earlier this year by Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Committee who said: ‘We do have to work harder to find places where wind turbines are acceptable and be more creative about sharing the benefits with locals. Frankly, we need to bribe them.’ Campaigners accused Energy Secretary Ed Davey of proposing 'bribes' to split communities over wind farms . Tom Leveridge of the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: ‘This would fundamentally undermine a core principle of the planning system – that planning permission should not be bought or sold - and put the countryside at greater risk from poorly sited wind developments. ‘A genuine attempt to promote community engagement in the design, location and layout of wind farms should lead to a more sensitive approach to reducing the impact wind turbines can have on our beautiful landscapes.’ There are more than 300 groups actively opposing applications and the government is concerned that less than half of applications are currently being granted by councils. Steve Hey, chairman of the campaign group No to Wold Wind Farms, which is fighting several turbine applications in East Yorkshire, said: ‘This already happens. Developers bribe people who are not directly affected to back it – pitching neighbour against neighbour and village against village. ‘People who have turbines right next to their house, and have their house price reduced by £20,000 will not benefit any more than the next village where people might not be affected at all. ‘I can’t believe this government is planning to use money to influence the planning process, it should be about the benefits and costs of the development. You cannot buy the English countryside and this will divide communities. I think it’s disgraceful.’ Mr Davey recently won a battle with George Osborne to cut wind subsidies by just 10 per cent, not the 25 per cent the Chancellor was pushing for. He said: ‘Onshore wind has an important role to play in a diverse energy mix that is secure, low carbon and affordable. We know that two thirds of people support the growth of onshore wind. ‘But far too often, host communities have seen the wind farms but not the windfall. We are sensitive to the controversy around onshore wind and we want to ensure that people benefit from having wind farms sited next to them.’ He cites a scheme near Burnfoot Hill Wind Farm in Devon where a community fund of £2.26million was put into community projects and another near Suide Wind Farm in Argyll, Scotland which raises £28,500 a year. Maf Smith , Deputy Chief Executive of RenewableUK said the wind industry employs 8.600 people and is worth £500million to the economy and should ‘ensure local people share fully in the economic benefits.’ He said: ‘Thousands of people around the UK are already seeing evidence of this – wind farm owners donate at least £1,000 for every megawatt we install, to be spent on community projects like improving sports facilities, village halls and school libraries.’","Wind farm developers could contribute to 'community funds' to placate campaigners .

Charges against 27 students recently accused of hazing have been dropped by Dartmouth College today. Through its judicial affairs office, the Ivy League school had charged more . than a quarter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity's members of violating school policy. The members were accused of threatening physical harm to new fraternity members, putting other students in . fear for their safety and/or engaging in hazing during the fall 2011 term. Allegations: Senior Andrew . Lohse, right, claims SAE fraternity brothers forced he and other members to swim vomit. SAE's Dartmouth president Brendan Mahoney, left, said no such events occurred during the 2011 pledgings . Animal house: More than a quarter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon's brotherhood had been accused of hazing after a former pledge said he and others were forced to swim in a kiddie pool of vomit and other bodily fluids . The . students also were accused of providing alcohol to underage students, providing . drugs and/or providing alcohol to obviously intoxicated individuals during the . same time period. The charges were based largely on . allegations made by former fraternity . member Andrew Lohse, who went public in January with allegations of . 'dehumanizing' experiences he said he witnessed at the fraternity. In a column . for the school newspaper, Lohse said the fraternity pressured pledges to swim in . a kiddie pool of rotten food, vomit and other bodily fluids; eat omelets made of . vomit; and chug cups of vinegar. He called those activities the norm rather than . the exception on Hanover campus, and he criticized the administration for not . doing enough when he made anonymous complaints last year. Brotherhood: 27 members of the fraternity face identical charges, according to SAE's president (there is no suggestion that any of those pictured here face charges) Taking action: More than more than 100 faculty members wrote to the Dartmouth administration, describing hazing as an 'open secret' and calling on the administration to set up a task force to address it . On Friday, college spokesman Justin Anderson said initial information . presented to the college supported the hazing charges, but it didn't hold up . under further scrutiny. 'Accordingly, all those charges against individuals have been rescinded,' he . told The Associated Press. 'Organizational charges against SAE remain . pending.' The fraternity's former president, Brendan Mahoney, declined to comment . Friday. He has said that nothing Lohse described, and nothing remotely close to . hazing, occurred at the fraternity in the fall 2011 pledge term. Sigma Alpha Epsilon provides all of its members with anti-hazing and risk management education and, several years ago, launched a comprehensive anti-hazing program called We Stand Together. Source: Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national website . By then, the . fraternity had gotten rid of any traditions that would be ""deemed problematic"" by the administration, Mahoney said, and no current members of SAE were members . in 2009 when Lohse was a pledge. He suggested the charges were a knee-jerk reaction to bad press, a suggestion . college administrators strongly denied. Officials also denied that the college . failed to act on Lohse's initial complaints. The college recently created a task force on hazing. Administrators also have . said they see hazing as part of a larger problem, tied together with binge . drinking and sexual assault, and have taken steps to address all three through . the National College Health Improvement Project the college launched last . year. Apart from the college, Hanover police also have been investigating Lohse's . claims, but Police Chief Nick Giaccone has said criminal charges are unlikely, . in large part because Lohse is not cooperating with police. Lohse did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Ms Johnson, the college . administrator, had strongly denied both Mr Lohse's allegation that the . college failed to act on his initial complaints. She said the administration already . had been working hard to tackle the issue of hazing and was not simply . responding to the recent allegations and faculty pressure. For . example, the college hired a new director of Greek organizations who . had been credited with turning around the fraternity and sorority system . at another college, has hired two sexual assault coordinators and is in . the process of hiring another alcohol and drug abuse counsellor. The . college sees hazing as part of a larger problem, tied together with . binge drinking and sexual assault, and has taken steps to address all . three through the National College Health Improvement Project it . launched last year. 'Clearly we put our resources where our mouth is,' she said. 'This idea that we have somehow thrown up our hands, said there's nothing we can do about hazing or other high risk behaviour going on college campuses is a complete mischaracterization.' Ms Johnson also said college officials did everything they could when Mr Lohse made his anonymous complaints, but the tips he provided didn't pan out. There are credibility issues surrounding . Mr Lohse’s  include Mr Lohse's 2010 arrest and conviction for cocaine . possession and witness tampering and a 2011 disorderly conduct . conviction, following a confrontation with a security officer during .

The Football Association today admitted it must do more to tackle racism in football as it prepares to interrogate John Terry over allegedly abusing rival player Anton Ferdinand. A report by a powerful committee of MPs today warned problems still exist with racism in the game, with Twitter acting as a new platform for abuse. Next week Terry will face an independent panel after he was charged by the FA of using racially abusive language towards Ferdinand last October. He denies the charge. Queens Park Rangers' English defender Anton Ferdinand (left) avoided shaking hands with Chelsea's defender John Terry (right) before Saturday's match between Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea at Loftus Road . He was found not guilty by Westminster Magistrates Court in a criminal trial, but faces another fight to clear his name next week after being charged by FA chiefs. Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘Recent incidents of racist abuse in the UK, both on and off the pitch, have highlighted the fact that there remain significant problems.’ He said social media has become a ‘tool for the spread of racist and abusive content, but it is also a potential means of combating the ignorance and prejudice that lie behind such behaviour’. Football authorities should use online forum to spread ‘positive messages’ about equality and diversity, he added. ‘More needs to be done to increase the diversity of the pool of candidates for coaches and referees, to embed the values of equality and diversity at all levels of the game.’ In response to the committee’s report, the FA said much progress had been made to tackle racism in the game but there remained room for improvement. In a statement the FA said: ‘We agree with the Committee that whilst substantial progress has been made to promote equality and tackle discrimination in the game, challenges remain for all of the football authorities. ‘We remain committed, along with all of our stakeholders, to promoting equality and diversity within the game and to the eradication of all forms of discrimination in football. ‘We will continue to work across the entire breadth of the sport to deliver our inclusion and anti-discrimination agenda. In doing so, we will consider in detail how the Committee’s recommendations can support and influence this work.’ John Terry was acquitted of abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand in a criminal trial at Westminster Magistrates court but was later charged by the Football Association . The report also called for more candidates from ethnic minorities to be trained as coaches and referees, with more transparent recruitment of managers and directors to encourage greater ethnic diversity. But it stopped short of recommending the Rooney Rule be adopted - the system used in American football in the NFL where shortlists for any head coach or senior management vacancy have to have at least one ethnic minority candidate. Piara Powar, executive director of European anti-discrimination network FARE, said the MPs had missed an opportunity to set out clear ways of achieving more black managers and coaches. Powar said: ‘There have been headline issues that English football has experienced over the last year, the Luis Suarez and John Terry cases, and those are very big issues that we need to deal with. ‘But the report had no clear direction on diversity hiring practices. “We now have less racism in football because people respect the achievements of black players but where is their role in the game as coaches and managers. Football needs to be given the lead. ‘We have a significant Asian population in Britain but where are the Asian players?'","Culture, media and sport committee says Twitter is fueling the problem .

Lawmakers united by their respect of Myanmar democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Wednesday presented her with Congress' highest civilian honour in a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, ahead of a meeting with President Barack Obama. Suu Kyi described it as 'one of the most moving days of my life.' She was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2008 while under a 15-year house arrest for her peaceful struggle against military rule. Celebrated: Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi holds her Congressional Gold Medal after it was presented to her by House Speaker John Boehner, seen left, in the U.S. Capitol in Washington . Acceptance: Suu Kyi's in-person acceptance of the award is four years overdue having been presented with the Congressional Gold Medal while under house arrest . Her moment: Standing in the Capitol Rotunda, Suu Kyi described the moment that stretched beyond uniting both sides of politics, in the U.S. and beyond, as 'one of the most moving days of my life' Her long-awaited visit to America finally provided an opportunity for her to receive the honour in person in Congress' most majestic setting, beneath the dome of the Capitol and ringed by marble statues of former presidents. The 67-year-old Nobel laureate said it was worth the years of waiting, being honoured 'in a house undivided, a house joined together to welcome a stranger from a distant land.' Previous recipients of the medal include George Washington, Tibetan Buddhist leader the Dalai Lama and Pope John Paul II. She then met privately at the White House with Obama, another winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. They appeared relaxed and were smiling as they talked in the Oval Office. Neither made formal comments to the photographers gathered to briefly witness the meeting. Recognition: Myanmar's Member of Parliament and democracy icon gently bowed her head with her applause and medal that has equally recognized George Washington, Tibetan Buddhist leader the Dalai Lama and Pope John Paul II . Nation's congratulations: Seated between House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Speaker Boehner, Suu Kyi receives the appreciation of former U.S. first lady Laura Bush . Worth the wait: The 67-year-old Nobel laureate said it was worth the years of waiting to be honoured 'in a house undivided' in welcoming a stranger to a foreign land . Obama 'expressed his admiration for her courage, determination and personal sacrifice in championing democracy and human rights over the years,' according to a statement from the White House. The White House said the president 'reaffirmed the determination of the United States to support their sustained efforts to promote political and economic reforms and to ensure full protection of the fundamental rights of the Burmese people.' The low-key nature of the meeting appeared to reflect concerns that Suu Kyi's Washington visit could overshadow Myanmar's reformist president Thein Sein, who attends the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week, and still faces opposition within Myanmar's military to political reform. At the medal ceremony, House and Senate leaders joined Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in paying tribute to Suu Kyi. Speaker after speaker at the medal ceremony marvelled that this was moment they thought they would never see: Suu Kyi before them, not only free but herself now a lawmaker. One-on-one: U.S. President Barack Obama later met personally with Suu Kyi in the Oval Office on Thursday where they sat for photos . Admiration: President Obama listens to Suu Kyi later saying he expressed his admiration for her courage, determination and personal sacrifice toward democracy . Companionship: Secretary of State of Hillary Clinton is seen embracing Suu Kyi after introducing her at the United States Institute of Peace on Wednesday . Time together: The couple later met in Secretary Clinton's office for photos and to meet one-on-one . Celebration: The pair continued to express their joy for the occasion, both smiling and laughing in her triumph . 'It's almost too delicious to believe, my friend,' said Clinton, 'that you are in the Rotunda of our Capitol, the centerpiece of our democracy as an elected member of parliament.' Buddhist monks in saffron robes and women in traditional Burmese dresses crammed into the venue alongside members of Congress, who set aside the intense rivalries ahead of the Nov. 6 election. Lawmakers talked about years of working together across party lines on the behalf of Suu Kyi's democracy movement. When sanctions against the Myanmar junta were imposed, and over the past year when they have been suspended, Democrats and Republicans alike have set aside their increasingly bitter differences to pass and renew legislation annually. That's due in large part to their respect for Suu Kyi. Lawmakers who have spoken or met with her, and even those who haven't, speak of her in reverential terms. Her photo adorns some office walls in Congress and her views have been critical in shaping U.S. policy toward the country also known as Burma. Work at home: Suu Kyi is seen sitting last week in her role as chairman of the Rule of Law and Stability Committee of House in Yangon, Myanmar . Efforts: Lawmakers in the U.S. talked about for years of working together across party lines on the behalf of Suu Kyi's democracy movement . Relationship abroad: Suu Kyi poses for photos along with the U.S.-ASEAN Eminent Persons Group and Derek Mitchell, fifth from right, the US ambassador to Myanmar, after meeting earlier this month in Yangon, Myanmar . Human impact: Suu Kyi's views have been critical in shaping U.S. policy toward the country also known as Burma . At Wednesday's emotional ceremony, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., lavished praise on a man who is usually his adversary, Republican leader Mitch McConnell, for long being at the forefront of efforts to help Suu Kyi for two decades. McConnell compared Suu Kyi's path of peaceful resistance to Martin Luther King and Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi. 'It was impossible not to be moved by her quiet resolve, her hidden yet luminous heroism,' the Kentucky senator said. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., often called a hero for the years he endured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said Suu Kyi was his hero. Former first lady Laura Bush said the hope that now grows in Myanmar was a tribute to Suu Kyi. She said the former military regime had encountered an 'immoveable object' in the opposition leader and its legitimacy broke against her character. Presence at home: Earlier this month Myanmar's opposition leader is seen leaving a branch office of her National League for Democracy party as she visits Kaw Hmu township where she won a parliament seat . Beloved: While holding pink and white orchids in her hand, Suu Kyi is seen escorted from the party's office in Yangon, Myanmar . People's vote: During her visit to Kaw Hmu township where she won a parliament seat in the April 1 Suu Kyi is greeted by a woman who shakes her hand . Send off: Holding a bouquet of flowers, Suu Kyi is seen walking through the international airport in Yangon on Sunday heading for her first visit to the U.S. in two decades . While speakers paid tribute to Suu Kyi's resolve in the face of oppression, a spirit of reconciliation in Myanmar also pervaded the ceremony - recognition of its recent dramatic political changes after five ruinous and bloody decades of authoritarian rule. A key aide to Thein Sein attended the ceremony, which Suu Kyi welcomed. The Treasury also announced it was taking Thein Sein off its list of individuals sanctioned from doing business or owning property in America. Since Suu Kyi won a parliamentary seat in April, the U.S. has normalized diplomatic relations with Myanmar and allowed U.S. companies to start investing there again. The administration is now considering easing the main plank of its remaining sanctions, a ban on imports. Suu Kyi voiced support for that step Tuesday, saying Myanmar should not depend on the U.S. to keep up its momentum for democracy. Some of her supporters, however, oppose it, saying reforms have not taken root and Washington will lose leverage with Myanmar, which still faces serious human rights issues. Clinton also expressed concern Tuesday that Myanmar retains some military contacts with North Korea.","Aung San Suu Kyi accepted the Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda on Wednesday by both side of Congress .

It happens every year. We get 12  months to learn the lyrics – but hardly anyone bothers. Now three-quarters admit they will mime or make up the words when the clock strikes midnight tomorrow . . . and the time comes for Auld Lang Syne. A poll found that some 37 per cent do not know a single line of Robert Burns’s piece, written in 1788. Its provenance is equally mysterious to some, especially when it comes to the younger revellers. One in ten under-25s think Elvis Presley or Paul McCartney wrote the words – whatever they may be. In terms of tactics, 37 per cent of all those surveyed said they hum loudly when their musical knowledge lets them down. Others prefer a more physical performance: a fifth attempt to prevent people from discovering their ignorance by distracting them with some vigorous arm-shaking while linking limbs during the seasonal sing-song. Almost two-thirds were also stumped over the meaning of the song’s title, which roughly translates as ‘Times Gone By’. Now three-quarters of respondents to a poll admitted they will mime or make up the words when the time comes to sing Auld Lang Syne on New Year's Eve . The survey, to mark the release of Warner Bros’ ensemble comedy New Year’s Eve, found 10 per cent typically gaze upwards through the duration of the song to avoid being detected. A cowardly 5 per cent actually leave the room altogether. Rather fittingly, the most commonly  misremembered lyric was: ‘Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?’ Some scamps replace the line with: ‘Should old acquaintance be forgot, and something else that rhymes.’ In total, 2,105 adults responded to the poll commissioned to promote the Hollywood film, which features a string of stars including Halle Berry, Michelle Pfeiffer, Zac Efron and Sarah Jessica Parker. Meanwhile, many people's celebrations are being adapted to deal with their financial worries, a survey has found. More people are planning a big night in than the traditional big night out this New Year’s Eve, with many revellers staying indoors due to concerns about cash. But this does not actualyl make for a cheaper evening, according to the Post Office Home Insurance New Year survey. Nearly three quarters of people (74 per cent) will stay in this year, it found, up from 72 per cent who were planning to stay in last year and 55 per cent in 2007. Money and cost are an important factor in deciding how to see in the New Year, with 14 per cent of people citing this as the main reason behind their plans. But those choosing to party at home are set to spend an average of £95 on food and alcohol - amounting to double the £48 average spend for those planning on heading out to celebrate. Post Office head of home insurance, Gerry Barrett, said: 'New Year’s Eve can end up being a costly night, and as our research shows bizarrely, it can be even more costly for those who plan to stay in.' Mr Barrett said the survey of 2,016 UK adults showed people look set to be emulating diners in Channel 4 programme Come Dine With Me. He said: 'Come Dine With Me fever is apparently gripping the nation as more people than ever plan to stay at home or hold dinner parties, but many hosts could see their bills mount up as they look to impress their friends.' While the lyrics for Auld Lang Syne are attributed to Robert Burns, it is likely that he merely adapted the words of an old ballad. Burns apparently sent a copy of the song to the Scots Musical Museum with the remark: 'The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man.' The poet also wrote a letter to Mrs Agnes Dunlop, attaching his version of Auld Lang Syne, in which he comments: 'Light be the turf on breast of the heaven-inspired poet who composed this glorious fragment! There is more of the fire of native genius in it than in half a dozen of modern English Bacchanalians.' Some say the famous chorus actually dates from the middle of the 16th century, if not before . The phrase 'Auld Lang Syne' is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (1570–1638), Allan Ramsay (1686–1757), and James Watson (1711) as well as older folk songs predating Burns. Contemporary Scottish poet Matthew Fitt uses the phrase 'In the days of auld lang syne' as the equivalent of 'Once upon a time...' in his retelling of fairy tales. But for those who need to brush up for the big night... Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  And never brought to mind?  Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  And auld lang syne!  CHORUS . For auld lang syne, my dear,  For auld lang syne.  We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  For auld lang syne. And to really impress here are verses two to five... And surely ye'll be your pint stowp!And surely I'll be mine!And we'll tak a cup o'kindness yet,For auld lang syne.We twa hae run about the braes,And pou'd the gowans fine;But we've wander'd mony a weary fit,Sin' auld lang syne.We twa hae paidl'd in the burn,Frae morning sun till dine;But seas between us braid hae roar'dSin' auld lang syne.And there's a hand, my trusty fere!And gie's a hand o' thine!And we'll tak a right gude-willie waught,For auld lang syne.","Poll found that some 37 per cent do not know a single line of Robert Burns’s piece, written in 1788 .

The new treatment uses a two-stage approach to stop cancers growing - and then destroy them from within . Medical experts in the UK have made a major breakthrough in their research to keep breast cancer at bay for longer. A new drug, which has been tested, has been proven to stall the disease for longer than current treatments, providing fresh hope for patients. The Freeman Hospital in Newcastle was among a handful of centres across the world to test a new treatment for advanced breast cancer. Results from the study also show the drug, T-DM1, significantly reduces the side effects of chemotherapy. While T-DM1 is undergoing further trials, the discovery is being hailed as a major step forward. Dr Mark Verrill, consultant medical oncologist at the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, has played a key role in the study, which specifically looked at an advanced form of the disease known as HER2-positive. He said: 'For the first time in breast cancer, we have been able to significantly extend patients’ remission time while also reducing the side effects associated with chemotherapy. 'This is an exciting development because HER2-positive breast cancer is very aggressive. Once it reaches the advanced stage it becomes difficult to treat and there is a real need for effective new treatments, like T-DM1, to improve the outlook for women with this aggressive disease.' T-DM1 is known as an 'antibody-drug conjugate', which is the first medicine of its kind for breast cancer. It joins together the accuracy of the HER2-targeted antibody, called Herceptin, with the power of the chemotherapy agent, DM1, as a single therapy. T-DM1 has been designed to find and destroy only the cancerous cells in a two-stage attack. Firstly, it attaches to the cancer growth and blocks signals that encourage the tumour to get larger and spread. Then it penetrates the cell’s outer defences and releases a high dose of chemotherapy to destroy it from within. The study’s results have been welcomed by breast cancer survivor, Joanne Smith, from Whickham, Gateshead. The 41-year-old, who was diagnosed in 2005 and had treatment over four years, said: 'Anything that helps people beat breast cancer is going to be good news and is very welcome. 'It’s lovely that advances are being made and it’s especially lovely that the North East has played a part in it.' Results from the study show that more patients responded to T-DM1 and for a longer period of time, compared with the currently licensed treatment known as lapatinib plus capecitabine chemotherapy. Researchers believe the technique of attaching a powerful chemotherapy to an antibody, like Herceptin, could also change the way other breast cancers are treated in the future. T-DM1 is already being trialled in the earlier stages of the disease where side-effects caused by chemotherapy, like diarrhoea and hair loss, have a huge impact on patients. The drug is not yet available for use. But based on the study’s results, a licence application will be made for its approval in the UK and Europe. Following authorisation from the European Medicines Agency, T-DM1 could be made available to patients in the UK in less than a year.","Drug T-DM1 proven to stall the disease longer than current treatments, says NHS Trust .

Retailers point to the economic downturn as one reason behind the decline in cod’s popularity, as people choose to save money and eat at home instead of getting takeaways from the chip shop. Naughty but nice: A calorie-packed portion of battered cod and chips has long been a favourite of hungry Britons, but new research suggests healthy salmon is now overtaking the white fish in the popularity stakes . Sales of frozen fish have boomed, with freezer packets of salmon proving a huge hit with shoppers. But budget is not thought to be the only reason behind the boost in sales – with the public also tempted by salmon’s low levels of fat and high protein and omega-3 content. An Asda spokeswoman said: ‘With its versatility and speed of cooking, salmon has now really cemented its status with families.’ Salmon isn’t the only fish winning the nation’s hearts – some less well-known species are also becoming popular.

Patricia Walker from University Park, Texas wanted to return the goods after learning that her ex-husband had been having an affair with her own 'trusted' Neiman Marcus personal shopper. The collection of clothing, jewellery, accessories and artworks had been given to Ms Walker over the three years she had spent recovering from a serious car accident. Not happy: Patricia Walker (above) from University Park, Texas, is suing Neiman Marcus after the store refused to refund $1.4million worth of goods bought for her by her ex-husband. She claims she never wanted the gifts . Expensive taste: The women's now ex-husband was allegedly cheating on her with her own personal shopper from Neiman Marcus, who received a commission on the goods, some of which are pictured above . The accident, which occurred in 2007, left her bedridden for a majority of the time. Favi Lo, the female personal shopper who had an affair with Ms Walker's ex-husband, Robert Tennison, received a 'steep commission' from the purchases according to the plaintiff's attorney Mike Ticer. Mr Ticer is assisting his client in filing a lawsuit against the store on the grounds of 'fraud', 'deceptive trade practices' and a 'violation of company policies' which normally allow customers to return goods within a specified time frame.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:26 EST, 3 August 2011 . Drama: Warren Jeffs, leaves the court . A jaw-dropping audio tape played in Warren Jeffs' sexual assault trial Tuesday shows the church leader instructing his sister wives that they must 'work together' to please him sexually. Mr Jeffs, the head of the . Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is accused . of sexually assaulting two girls, ages 12 and 15, he took as brides in . 'spiritual marriages.' He objected as the tape was prepared, and his frustrations continued as it was played, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. The 90-minute segment details how the young brides should become 'so natural as clothed as unclothed' and always shower before getting near him. Mr Jeffs is also heard instructing the woman on how to maintain their pubic hair, and a woman is heard showing the other wives how to properly shave their armpits. He says on the tape: 'No one sits around, everyone assists each other.' This came after a doctor and forensic analyst testified the 55-year-old Jeffs was the father of a 15-year-old's child. An excerpt from hundreds of pages of Mr . Jeffs' personal journals said the child was 'pure and innocent and . willing to obey' and he summoned her parents and 'informed them of their . girl belonging to me.' Prosecutors played the tape of Warren Jeffs . talking to the girl when she was 14 after Texas Ranger Nick . Hannah testified about documents and electronic files seized during a . 2008 police raid at the church's remote compound in West Texas. Among the documents seized was a record of Jeffs' spiritual marriage 'for time and all eternity' with the 14-year-old in January 2004. The FLDS church believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. Followers see Jeffs as a prophet who is God's spokesman on earth. Hannah read from Mr Jeffs' journals, which said he took the 14-year-old the night after their wedding with him and another of his new wives on a car ride outside the church's headquarters along the Utah-Arizona border for 'training.' There, he instructed them on their responsibilities as his wives and had the session taped. The recording was transcribed and placed in church records later seized by police. Lead prosecutor Eric Nichols played the tape for jurors, who followed along using transcripts. The recording was difficult to understand due to traffic noise, and the transcript wasn't made public. 'A good wife is trained for her husband and follows the spirit of peace,' Jeffs is heard saying. He also makes reference to 'drawing close' or 'being close,' which is how church members refer to sex. Two female voices are heard saying 'OK.' The FLDS: a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism that believes polygamy is the key to heaven . In writing about the session in his . journal later, Jeffs said he told his wives they were 'honorable . vessels, property of your husband's kingdom and the Kingdom of God on . Earth.' Mr Jeffs has represented himself since firing his high-powered attorneys last week. Warning: Judge Barbara Walther, who limps after suffering from polio, was told by Jeffs that God had sent 'a crippling disease upon her which shall take her life soon' He objected half a dozen times to the . tape being played, arguing that the training session was protected by . religious privacy rights. State District Judge Barbara Walther overruled him. Hannah read excerpts of Mr Jeffs' journal where he described the Lord ordering him to visit Eldorado, . Texas, about 45 miles south of San Angelo, and the church purchasing . 1,700 acres of land outside the town for $1.2 million in 2003. He called . the area 'Place of Refuge 17,' or R-17. 'This will only be a place of . refuge if it is kept sacred and secret,' Mr Jeffs wrote, adding that his . followers should populate the area and let 'a community grow here more . in hiding before the neighbors find out.' He told followers to plant cotton . and raise animals and said they could build whatever they wanted thanks . to Texas' lax zoning laws. Construction teams working around-the-clock . erected dozens of buildings, including a sprawling, white-limestone . temple. Texas authorities raided the . compound in April 2008 after receiving a call to an abuse hotline that . turned out to be a hoax. More than 400 FLDS children who were placed in . protective custody were eventually returned to their families.

Mugshot: Jeffs after being arrested following the 2009 raid on his church . The development comes after gasps were released from juors yesterday when pictures were revealed showing him kissing and . cuddling a 12-year-old girl. The photographs show Jeffs with a young . redhead, who he is alleged to have raped, grinning and kissing the . girl. The images were said to have been taken July 27, 2006 – days after the girl’s 12th . birthday. Jeffs also made a third attempt to remove the trial judge Barbara . Walther yesterday, claiming God himself had demanded she ‘step away from this abuse of power against a religious . and pure faith in the Lord’. He addressed the judge directly, saying: . ‘I, your lord, say to you, I shall bring to light your evil intent now, . before all people, to destroy my Church on earth.’ Jeffs has repeatedly called the raid . an illegal search and wants a separate hearing on whether authorities . violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of religion. Mrs Walther, who walks with a limp . after suffering polio in childhood, has refused - prompting three . different calls to recuse her by the defendant, whose followers believe . is God’s spokesman. Jeffs also attached what he called . ‘Exhibit A’, consisting of 29 orders from the Lord, including one in . which God sent ‘a crippling disease upon (Walther) which shall take her . life soon.’ He regularly objects when prosecutors enter new evidence — arguing that his religious freedoms are being trampled. Old-fashioned garb: Women from Jeffs's polygamist sect pictured after their relocation from Yearning for Zion in 2008 . Yesterday . Jeffs told the court: ‘We are a people of historical abuse. This is not . new to us because of prejudice in the populace and government.’ Lawyers usually ignore his objections and let Mrs Walther overrule them. But . yesterday lead prosecutor Eric Nichols finally hit out by responded . that ‘this is not a proceeding against a people. This is a proceeding . against an individual.’ Mrs Walther yesterday ruled that a hearing would eventually take place on Mr Jeffs’s motion, but that the trial would continue . She . said new Texas Supreme Court rules meant that an immediate hearing was . no longer required to recuse a judge after a case has beguns. No date has been set for a hearing on Jeffs' motion. The . trial continued with forensic analyst Amy Smuts, of the Human . Identification Center at the University of North Texas in Fort Worth, . testifying that a DNA sample collected from Jeffs had 15 major markers . that matched a sample taken from a girl born to a 15-year-old mother. Miss Smuts said that made her ‘more than 99.99 per cent certain’ that Jeffs fathered the child, who was born in October 2005. In other testimony, former sect . member Rebecca Musser explained that FLDS women are taught that they . must rely on their husbands or fathers to find grace in heaven. Interaction: A sketch of lead prosecutor Eric Nichols speaking to the jury on Friday. Monday, he showed them pictures of Jeffs kissing a 12-year-old girl . She also said the church governs all . aspects of members' lives, from dictating when they wake up every day to . what clothes they wear, what work they do, how they comb their hair, . and what they eat. Miss . Musser was born into the sect but left in 2002. She was married in 1995, . at age 19, to 85-year-old Rulon Jeffs, Warren Jeffs' father and . predecessor as ecclesiastical leader. She . said Warren personally gave detailed lectures to young girls on what . was expected of them sexually once they were ordered into spiritual . marriages with older members. ‘They are taught what the duties are as a wife to that husband, not just spiritually but physically,’ she said. ‘You give yourself to him and that means body, mind and spirit.’ Mr Nichols asked: ‘Are young girls taught that giving themselves to that man and pleasing him is, in effect, pleasing God?’ ‘Yes,’ Miss Musser replied. Authorities . raided the Yearning For Zion compound, 45 miles south of San Angeleno, . after receiving an anonymous call to an abuse shelter, alleging that . girls at the compound were being forced into polygamist marriages. The . call turned out to be a hoax, and more than 400 children who had been . placed in state custody were returned to their families. But police seized marriage records and thousands of pages of documents and eventually charged Jeffs and 11 other FLDS men. All seven sect members who have been prosecuted so far were convicted of crimes including sexual assault and bigamy and received prison sentences of between six and 75 years. Jeffs went through seven attorneys in the six months leading up to the trial, firing his last defence team just as opening statements were to begin.","Instructions to young wives include showering before going near him and maintaining armpit and pubic hair .

World leaders will gather for crunch talks at Camp David today as Greece teeters on the edge of exiting the euro. The Group of Eight industrialised nations meet at the U.S. presidential retreat near Washington DC for a two-day summit. The focus will be on Greece as it stumbles toward an unprecedented eurozone exit that could rock the global economy. The new French president Francois Hollande (right) and German chancellor Angela Merkel will be present at the G8 summit for talks on the debt crisis as Greece's future in the eurozone appears uncertain . It comes as EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht revealed for the first time today that the European Commission and the European Central Bank are working on an emergency scenario in case Greece does leave. He said: 'A year and a half ago there may have been the danger of a domino effect. 'But today there are, both within the European Central Bank and the European Commission, services that are working on emergency scenarios in case Greece doesn't make it.' A call was also made today by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble for the introduction of a directly elected EU president to help strengthen the bloc's political union and overcome the debt crisis. He said: 'We've got to create a political union now. We need strong European institutions.' His comments follow a fresh round of market panic sparked by elections in the debt-ridden country that saw huge losses for the parties that back austerity measures. A political crisis has followed leaving the two-year-old effort to prevent a Greek default on its 173billion euro ($220 billion) bailout on life support. Merkel could end up arguing with host U.S. President Barack Obama at Camp David as the summit discusses austerity measures for Greece . It is possible the June 17 election will result in a government that would refuse to implement the austerity measures that Greece's last remaining international creditors are insisting on. Speculation is increasing that Greece may have to leave the eurozone and markets across the globe fear the crisis may be slipping beyond control. In Spain, the main share index fell this morning more than 2 per cent before recovering, while shares in London fell by as much as 1 per cent. Confidence in European banks was also undermined by ratings agency Moody's, which cut the credit ratings of 16 Spanish banks. The country said today it will name independent auditors to probe bad loans and property holdings in the financial sector and determine how big a state bailout is needed. In Asia, stock markets registered heavy losses. Tokyo's Nikkei average fell 3 per cent, the biggest one day fall since last August. Asian markets were also hit by losses in New York, where the Dow Jones closed more than 1 per cent lower. The crisis has been fuelled by ratings agency Moody's, cutting the credit ratings of 16 Spanish banks . Bad news: A long list of negative numbers shows losses on Spain stock exchange in Madrid as the crisis spreads . Crisis: In the Greek parliament a provisional government has been forced to fill the breach before fresh elections in six weeks . 'The crisis in Greece is a very serious and immediate problem,' said Uri Dadush, a former senior World Bank official. 'Bank deposits are leaving Greece today.' But elections France and Germany have shattered a long-standing consensus that spending cuts are the answer to Greece - and Europe's - woes leaving the G8 divided as the end game approaches. New French President Francois Hollande is sure to use his first G8 to press for pro-growth policies, and is likely to win the backing of most people around the table. That puts the pro-austerity German Chancellor Angela Merkel firmly in the hot seat as pressure grows for a new direction. High-level talks: Prime Minister David Cameron holds the attention of parents and children during a visit to Coram's Parents Centre in London before the G8 kicks off . 'The medicine that they have been taking is not working' said Dadush. 'This will be an opportunity for the US, Italy and France, not to gang up, but to work together on Merkel to say 'look, you need a somewhat different approach.'' Merkel may even find herself arguing with her host, President Barack Obama. Fearing the impact of European financial chaos on the United States as it approaches elections in November, Obama seems poised to wade into what has largely been a European debate. At the summit, Obama will raise 'specific' actions Europe could take, as the US welcomes the 'debate in Europe about the imperative for jobs and growth,' according to National Security Adviser Tom Donilon. Still, with Obama unwilling or unable to put more cash on the table, he may find himself with minimal leverage. A compromise may be found in the creation of joint European bonds for specific infrastructure or investment projects in hard-up countries. Supporters say the move would allow much needed stimulus at a relatively low cost and keep budget cuts in place, allowing the G8 to claim it is focusing on austerity and growth. Others argue that will do little to reverse the drag that fiscal consolidation has put on the economies of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy. G8 leaders will hold their main discussions on Europe's fiscal plight Saturday at Camp David's rustic collection of cabins in the wooded Catoctin Mountain in Maryland, outside Washington. On Friday night, discussions around the dinner table at Obama's Laurel Lodge will focus on Iran's nuclear challenge ahead of talks between global powers and the Islamic Republic in Baghdad later this month. The leaders are also expected to address Syria's crackdown on its anti-government uprising, fears North Korea will launch a new nuclear test and Myanmar, after Obama eased US investment restrictions Thursday on the country formerly known as Burma. The G8 club of developed nations includes the U.S., Britain, Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan and Russia.","EU admits it is working on a contingency plan .

An Islamist terror group has threatened to launch a wave of attacks against Britain if Abu  Qatada is deported. Al-Shabab militants, who are based in Somalia, say they will plunge Britain into ‘disaster’. Last week Al Qaeda warned it would open ‘the gates of evil’ if the hate cleric was sent back to Jordan for trial. On an internet forum used by militants, Al-Shabab said: ‘The British public is forewarned that it will be the British government, as a result of its imprudence, that shall be liable for any disaster that befalls them, or their national interests.’ The message was discovered by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online activity from terrorist groups. The group also found the Al Qaeda message that said: ‘We warn the British government against extraditing Sheikh Abu Qatada to Jordan.’ The terror network called on the Government to ‘act with reason and wisdom ... or it will regret it’. The hate preacher was arrested and hauled before a court on Tuesday with Home Secretary Theresa May saying he would ‘soon be on a plane and out of the country for good’. The action was ordered because Home Office lawyers believed the deadline for Qatada to try to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg had passed the night before. But in a farcical development it appeared that the deadline had not been missed after all, with court officials indicating that Qatada’s lawyers had until Tuesday night to lodge papers. Discovery: SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online activity from terrorist groups, said that Somalia's al-Qaeda-linked militant group al-Shabab also issued a warning on militant forums Monday . Denials: Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured today, continues to insist there had been no blunder by her officials over Qatada's case . Now five judges will have to decide whether to pass the case to the Grand Chamber, the highest body of the European court. If they find for Qatada it could undermine the prospects of sending 14 other terrorists home, including one linked to Al-Shabab. Another, known only as XX, is an . Algerian described in court documents as a ‘leading organiser and . facilitator of terrorist activity overseas’. Tim Farron, president of the Liberal . Democrats, told BBC Question Time on Thursday: ‘I take the view that . there’s an Olympic-standard screw-up somewhere here, whether it’s with . the European Court, or it’s Theresa May or with her officials. ‘What I’m absolutely certain of is that Abu Qatada should be deported. He should be on a plane as soon as possible.’ Mrs May made no reference to the case . yesterday as she attended a workplace diversity conference in central . London organised by gay rights group Stonewall. But shadow home secretary Yvette . Cooper accused her of ‘taking risks with national security’, and said . the episode was a ‘shambles’. ‘The Home Secretary needs to come . clean and explain how this fiasco happened and how she is taking . responsibility to put it right,’ she added. Tory MP Mark Spencer has . said the saga risks painting the UK as a safe haven for terrorists, . while Sir Peter Tapsell said it was time the UK ‘withdrew its legal . processes’ from the European court. The five judges on the Qatada panel are expected to make their ruling by the end of this month.","SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online activity from terrorist groups, said al-Shabaab had issued a warning on militant forums ."

Two schoolboys are being questioned today over the death of a teenage footballer who was the best friend of X Factor star Frankie Cocozza. The youngsters, both aged 14, are accused of being involved in a fight on Saturday night which ended with Connor Saunders, 19, being punched to the ground.

He is not the first politician to attempt to 'look cool,' when listening to music and he definitely won't be the last. But George Osborne has become an unlikely internet hit after a YouTube user flagged up his embarrassing attempt to bob his head along to a rock band. The chancellor was a guest on the Andrew Marr Show when the presenter introduced British band Keane at the end of the programme. Scroll down for video . Nonplussed: George Osborne was a guest on the Andrew Marr Show. As Keane start to play their single, the camera panned to the guests and Mr Osborne looked disinterested . Spotted: When the politician realises the camera is focused on him, he completely changes his body language. He looks straight at the camera before looking back at the band and bobbing his head in time to the music . Musical appreciation: George Osborne has now been mocked for 'attempts to look cool' as he listens to Keane . But Mr Osborne is not the only politician to look awkward on the sofa when being played to by musicians on the show. Nick Clegg is seen engaging in some finger tapping when Brit Award winner Emeli Sandi performed weeks earlier. In contrast Prime Minister David Cameron is a lot more reserved in his appreciation of the live music as his reaction to singer PJ Harvey shows in a clip from years earlier. However the funniest video is of the Corrigan Brothers performing their political song 'There’s no-one as Irish as Barack Obama' in 2008. In the clip, William Hague, who was Shadow Foreign Secretary at the time, and the then Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, are in stitches on the sofa over the song. In the past politicians have been left with egg on their face over their public declarations of their favourite music. In 2010, David Cameron was blasted by The Smiths’ guitarist Johnny Marr for saying he liked the band. Marr took to Twitter and said: 'David Cameron stop saying that you like The Smiths. No you don’t. I forbid you to like it.' Similarly former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was left embarrassed when he claimed to be a fan of rock band the Arctic Monkeys but admitted he could not name one of their songs. As the band start to play their single, Silenced By The Night, the camera panned to the guests. Originally there is no reaction from Mr Osborne who stared at the group looking nonplussed as these pictures show. But when the politician realises the camera is focused on him, he completely changes his body language. In cringe-worthy fashion the Tory MP looks straight at the camera before looking back at the band and bobbing his head in time to the music. The hilarious attempt to look interested has been mocked on YouTube in a video titled 'The Art of Politics No.1: George Osborne.' In a humorous text commentary that accompanies the clip, it reads: 'The Andrew Marr Show loves to sign off with a bit of music. In this case Keane, led by their uncanny David Cameron lookalike. 'As the band performs, the show’s other guests watch from the sofa. 'One of this week’s guests was George Osborne. What did George think? Not a rave review. 'But watch his reaction when he realises the camera’s on him. Great recovery.' The video has already had more than 1,200 hits and provoked some funny comments online.

But yesterday the internet troll who threatened to kill one of Tory MP Louise Mensch’s children finally faced justice. Frank Zimmerman, 60, had been found guilty in his absence last month of sending an electronic message that was ‘grossly offensive or of an indecent, offensive or menacing character’. Internet troll: Frank Zimmerman, 60, of Gloucester, leaves Gloucester Magistrates Court, after his sentencing was delayed . In one email, he told Mrs Mensch that her computer and phones had been hacked and that images of her family would be posted online. His email contained foul-mouthed insults and ordered Mrs Mensch to stop using Twitter, where she has 50,000 followers. In the most chilling message,  Zimmerman told the 40-year-old Corby MP: ‘You now have a Sophie’s choice. Which kid is to go? Who will you choose?’ The question was a reference to the 1982 film Sophie’s Choice in which a mother, played by Meryl Streep, is forced to decide which of her two children will be sent to the gas chambers. Mrs Mensch later told police that  the message had left her feeling ‘extremely scared’. Yesterday, police drove Zimmerman to Gloucester Magistrates’ Court for sentencing. But in a further twist, the case was adjourned and he was bailed until next month. Defence: Zimmerman claimed to have no memory of sending the messages to Mrs Mensch . The white-bearded defendant from Gloucester claims to suffer from agoraphobia and was allowed to sit in a separate room in the court building, participating via video link. He claimed to have no memory of sending the message. However the malicious emails were traced back to his computer through its IP address, a unique code assigned to every terminal.

Controversial weapons known as ‘sonic cannons’ will be used during the London Olympics, the Ministry of Defence revealed yesterday. The devices emit a pain-inducing noise, said to be as loud as a military jet taking off, which can be used to disperse crowds. The Long Range Acoustic Device, which is made in America, will also be used to control possible riots at the football European Championships this summer. Olympic preparations: A Royal Marines landing craft, top, fitted with an American-made Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) at the front, exercises with a patrol craft on the Thames . The devices were tested by the MoD last week during a major security exercise before the Olympics. They can emit noises of up to 150 decibels and are said to be highly directional, meaning security forces are able to point the devices at clear target groups. A video of the device being used at a G20 protest in the US shows demonstrators running away covering their ears. As well as emitting ear-splitting tones, the device can also be used to communicate verbal messages to crowds, such as telling them to disperse.

David Cameron and fellow Nato leaders will today map out plans to withdraw frontline troops from the fight against the Taliban in two years’ time. On the ground: SAS troops will stay in Afghanistan to conduct counter-terrorism operations against the remnants of Al Qaeda after UK combat soldiers leave in 2014 . Officials said the ‘great majority’ of British forces would come home but they conceded the SAS and their naval counterparts, the SBS, are almost certain to remain after the deadline, so UK personnel will still be in harm’s way. The SAS and SBS have done valuable covert work uncovering Taliban bomb factories and identifying the location of their leaders for air and ground attacks. The G8 summit in America this weekend will draw up plans for withdrawal from Afghanistan and agree to provide funds for Afghan armed forces after 2014. Talks: David Cameron and fellow Nato leaders will today map out plans to withdraw frontline troops from the fight against the Taliban in two years' time . Britain will contribute £70 million a year to a total fund of £700 million. The UK is also running an officer-training school in the Afghan capital Kabul dubbed ‘Sandhurst in the sand.’ The UK will begin to dramatically reduce troop numbers next year. The timetable mapped out at the summit will see Afghan forces take control of all combat missions by the middle of 2013. At that point, commanders will agree a more concrete plan on how quickly they can remove the remaining soldiers. A senior British official said: ‘Our forces will not remain in a combat role in Afghanistan beyond 2014. The majority that remain will be in a training and mentoring role. ‘But I wouldn’t rule out a small number of forces playing a counter-terrorism role if needed. 'This would be in keeping with how we are working to protect ourselves from the threat emanating from other parts of the world, such as the Arabian Peninsula.’ Security sources said the size of the British deployment would depend on where Al Qaeda was operating in 2014. The number of Special Forces could be as low as ten, but could be as high as 200.","Senior sources say SAS will stay in Helmand to help Afghan forces weed out insurgents .

But these spectacular azaleas did at least brighten up one girl’s afternoon during a miserable, dank weekend. Lily Manning, eight, made her way through the colourful display at Exbury Gardens in the New Forest, Hampshire, as the rest of the country sheltered under umbrellas. Shrubbing up nicely: Eight-year-old Lily Manning marvels at the brightly coloured azaleas at Exbury Gardens in the New Forest, on what was a largely overcast spring weekend . Heavy rain across large parts of Britain and below-average temperatures have led some to speculate that we are on course for the coldest start to May in 70 years. And few who did venture out yesterday would dare to disagree. As temperatures failed to get anywhere near the 16c (61f) average for this time of year, the beach resorts of Brighton and Bournemouth were all but deserted. One Bournemouth tourist, Sarah Slade, 38, from Milton Keynes, said: ‘When I booked a mini-break at the seaside for the May bank holiday I had hoped to pack my bikini and suntan lotion. Instead I’ve had to dig out some of my winter clothing. It feels like February, not May.’ Tesco said that umbrella sales were up by 2,580 per cent from this time last year – when the skies were blue and the heat rivalled anything in the Mediterranean – while sales of wellington boots rose by 256 per cent. ‘This time last year we were out in our gardens enjoying barbecue food but the miserable weather has had shoppers stocking up on the kind of food they would normally buy in mid-winter,’ said Karen Poole, a manager at the supermarket. The total cost of the weekend wash-out to Britain’s tourism industry is yet to be calculated, but is expected to run into tens of millions of pounds. Visitor numbers to the Thomas Cook website have soared by 27 per cent in a week, as Britons look for warmer weather abroad. Temperatures . dipped to a freezing -5C (23F) in Scotland yesterday morning and it was . several degrees colder in the North than would be expected for this time . of year. After an . unusually mild festive season, which saw many areas reaching the low . teens, Spring has been a wash-out across most of Britain so far.

The coastal scenes were little changed from December, when temperatures did not fall below 8 or 9C (46-48F) on Christmas Day.

Tesco . said sales of umbrellas were up 2,580 per cent from last year, and . those of wellies were up 256 per cent, according to The Times. Comfort food has also remained . unusually popular for this time of year, with fresh soup sales up by 150 . per cent, and hot chocolate 26 per cent.

The homes overlook Peewit Caravan Park, on land below, which has also suffered from the catastrophic landslip. Pipes feeding a drainage pond at the top have broken, sending a cascade of water through the soil onto the site. Liz Smith, of Peewit, said water was . careering over the park's new bowls green. She said: 'We have 34 . privately-owned caravans in that area and we are having to tell the . owners to bring their wellies to reach them.' Emma King, Flagship's customer . services director, said: 'Our first priority has been to get on site . with our customers to limit inconvenience. 'There . have been longstanding problems with this road and the recent heavy . rainfall is likely to have had an impact on the condition too.

'We acknowledge the frustration felt by local residents and will continue to work with them to try and make life easier.' After the . wettest April since records began in 1910, there seems to be no end to the gloom in sight.

'As the . low deepens, strong winds may increase to gale force, especially near . the south coast.’ In London yesterday the mercury hit . just 9C (48F), while in Leeming, North Yorkshire, it plummeted as low as . -3C (27F).

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 15:50 EST, 25 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:57 EST, 25 May 2012 . Rich: Top U.S. financier Robert Agostinelli was the subject of a blag by Steve Whittamore, a private detective working for News International . A private detective working for Rupert Murdoch's newspapers used a legally questionable tactic to blag a hotel bill run up by a top New York financier at one of London's swankiest hotels, records show. Private investigator Steve Whittamore, or someone working for him, tricked Claridge's in Mayfair, central London, to get a copy of a bill belonging to Robert Agostinelli. The Whittamore database entry on Mr Agostinelli is one of the few pieces of evidence to surface so far that Americans were targeted by operatives working for Murdoch's British newspapers. Allegations have surfaced that journalists or investigators working for Murdoch may have used similar tactics on celebrities visiting the U.S., but so far those allegations relate to journalists and targets based in Britain. An FBI investigation so far has turned up no evidence to substantiate allegations that 9/11 victims may have been targeted for intrusion by Murdoch journalists or investigators. Mr Agnostinelli, a U.S. citizen, runs the Rhone Group private equity firm. He is a former senior partner at Goldman Sachs and Lazard and ranks among the richest financiers in the world. Whittamore was arrested in March 2003 and subsequently convicted of trading in illegally obtained information, but did was not sentenced to serve jail time. He could not be reached for comment. The Whittamore database was put together by the Information Commissioner's Office, a government privacy watchdog, from records seized in a police raid on the private detective's office. The database indicates that Whittamore's inquiry regarding Mr Agostinelli was commissioned by Murdoch's now-defunct Sunday tabloid, the News of the World. The database shows an address for the financier on Fifth Avenue, New York City. It describes Whittamore's assignment as a 'Claridges blag'. 'Blag' is a slang word meaning that a private detective adopts a false identity in order to con information out of a targeted organisation or individual. In the U.S., blagging is known as 'pretexting'. According to the website of the Federal Trade Commission, pretexting is illegal under federal law if the purpose is to obtain 'customer' or financial information. In Britain blagging is usually illegal. But newspapers can defend themselves against legal complaints by asserting that the use of the practice in a specific case was in the 'public interest.' The Whittamore database records show that as a result of the 'Claridges blag', information was obtained about a four-day hotel stay, in a room which cost £411.25 per night. The total bill was £3,433.98. The records show that the hotel stay in question was in the month of July, but do not specify a year. Upmarket: Claridges Hotel in Mayfar, central London, where Mr Agostinelli ran up a £3,433.98 bill . Searches through media databases do not indicate that stories about Agostinelli appeared in the News of the World in the period before or soon after the police raid during which Whittamore's records were seized. Some years later, press articles did mention Mr Agostinelli as a member of a group which was interested in buying Liverpool FC, but ultimately lost out to another American bidder. Blow: Rupert Murdoch appears at the Leveson Inquiry, which is investigating the practices and ethics of the press . Mr Agostinelli appeared as No. 19 in the 2011 edition of an annual 'rich list' published by Murdoch's Sunday Times. The paper said Mr Agostinelli was now 'London-based', with estimated wealth of £625million, and counted former French President Nicholas Sarkozy as a friend. The journalist named in the Whittamore database as having commissioned the private detective to investigate Mr Agostinelli, who now works for a different newspaper, said he had never heard of the tycoon and maintained that the database entry referring to him was inaccurate. Mr Agostinelli did not respond to messages left for him at Rhone Group offices in New York and London. A spokesman for Claridges declined to comment. Murdoch's UK newspaper empire is the principal target of the Leveson Inquiry into the practices and ethics of the British press. A spokeman for News International said: 'The information ... was the subject of a report by the Information Commissioner's Office in 2006 and has been examined extensively by the Leveson Inquiry in recent months. News International has given detailed evidence on these matters.' The spokesman added: 'There is a public interest defence available for any potential breach of the Data Protection Act and you do not have the information necessary to make any judgement on specific cases. We are not in a position to comment on a specific case.'","One of the few pieces of evidence to show Murdoch papers have invaded the privacy of U.S. citizens .

A federal agency charged with preventing the spread of infectious diseases has come under attack for 'serious' airflow problems in one of their buildings that houses anthrax, SARS and monkeypox. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) works to develop disease prevention and control, with particular focus on infectious diseases. But despite harbouring lethal airborne gases new documents reveal that their building in Atlanta has a poorly engineered airflow system which could expose unprotected staff and visitors to dangerous pathogens. Concern: The Centers for Disease Control were accused of having serious airflow problems in one of their buildings housing infectious diseases . On February 16 safety inspector Eddie Jackson sent an email to a top CDC official which said: 'As the door . closed a very noticeable puff of air could be felt coming through the . slit in the window out into the ""clean corridor"".' ANTHRAX: Caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis and transported through spores, anthrax causes respiratory infection in humans. It starts with cold or flu-like symptoms which last for several days, followed by fatal respiratory collapse. SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome is another respiratory disease in humans, caused by the Sars coronavirus. Resembling severe flu the virus killed 916 people between November 2002 and July 2003. MONKEYPOX:This exotic infectious disease causes symptoms similar to small pox. Monkeypox can be transmitted to humans from infected animals and cases occur primarily in remote villages of Central and West Africa in proximity to tropical rainforests. Under biosafety regulations imposed by the CDC itself labs housing the most dangerous 'inhalable' infectious gases must be maintained under negative pressure. Meaning that pressure inside the room should always be less than that on the outside - ensuring that no toxic air will flow out. Dr Richard Besser, former head of the CDC Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response, said airflow systems serve as a final safeguard keeping dangerous germs confined to labs. Worryingly the revelations about inadequate airflow are just the latest in a long history of botched safety procedures at the $214 million infectious diseases laboratory in Atlanta. In 2007 backup generators failed to keep airflow systems working during a power outage reports ABC News. While in 2008 the door to the lab housing Coxiella Burnetii - a bacterium which causes the life-threatening Q-fever - was found to be sealed with duct tape. Nine workers were tested for the bacterium, which causes the fever, but none were infected. Shocking: In 2008 a door to the lab housing a deadly bacterium was found to be sealed with duct tape (picture posed by model) Congressman John Dingell said: 'This is yet another incident that calls into question CDC's self-inspection policy.' And Dr Besser added that the airflow issue and the failure of the CDC to respond quickly highlighted the problems with self-inspection. The CDC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were found to have serious airflow issues at their building in Atlanta .

A woman and her two children emerged from within the house on the 8600 block of Santa Susana Place, and neighbours confirmed that a family of four live there. Police vehicles blocked off access to the two-story property and the search went on until around 9am. Witnesses said they didn’t appear to leave with anything. 57-year-old Smith was reported missing after he failed to pick his son up for school or turn up to work on May 1. He has not been heard from since. His distraught family launched a media campaign hoping that a member of the public would come forward with news of his whereabouts. Two weeks ago Smith was spotted having dinner in California with a woman, it was claimed. A fellow diner at Taco Temple in Morro Bay, David Brill said he saw the missing exec on May 7 in the restaurant but didn't realise who it was until the next day. He said: 'I noticed on the Yahoo main page that there was a news link to a missing Hollywood executive,' Brill told news station NBC LA.

Suffered multiple injuries: Hannah Windsor, 17, was found at a beauty spot after being stabbed to death in a horrific attack . A teenage girl was stabbed to death after being attacked at a secluded beauty spot. The body of 17-year-old Hannah Windsor was found hidden in undergrowth close to the historic Bidston Hill Observatory on the outskirts of Birkenhead, Wirral. A post-mortem found she died as a result of multiple injuries. It is understood police officers were alerted after a walker found items belonging to a woman including a handbag, clothing and keys in an area of woodland. Hannah, from Birkenhead, had been reported missing by staff at the assisted accommodation where she lived. They launched an extensive search and the body of the teenager was later found in a secluded spot near a footpath close to the historic Bidston Hill Observatory on the outskirts of Birkenhead, Wirral. Detectives arrested an 18-year-old man in the nearby village of Moreton. He has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody where he is being questioned by detectives. Last night, her family was said to be 'devastated' and were too upset to comment. They were being comforted by family and friends and specially-trained police family liaison officers. Police found the body of the girl at about 5.30pm on Saturday after a phone call from a member of the public. With a peak of 231ft, Bidston Hill is one of the highest points on the Wirral and there has been a lighthouse on the site since the 1770s. The Bidston Observatory was built in 1866 and stands in a large park of woods and grassland. Gathering evidence: Detectives and forensic officers near the scene where Hannah's body was discovered by a walker on the outskirts of Birkenhead, Wirral . Up until 1969, the 'One O'Clock Gun' overlooking the River Mersey would be fired electrically from the Observatory. It was later used by the Natural Environment Research Council but has stood empty since the council moved its operations to the University of Liverpool in 2004. There have been various plans for the site but in recent years it has become a magnet for youths who congregate on the woodland to drink and take drugs. Yesterday, friends and residents said they were shocked and upset at the death of the girl. A Facebook group entitled 'R.I.P HANNAH WINDSOR /3' has over 500 members and friends of the teen have posted their tributes. Establishing leads: Detectives believe Hannah knew her attacker and have asked for anyone with information to come forward . Katie Griffiths said: 'Rest in peace hannah, you were such a lovely girl, always had a smile on your face when I seen you around school, you will be missed by so many, you were an inspiration to so many people!' Stacie Michelle Barker added: 'Hannah I can't cope knowing your not here anymore but I will see you soon.'I am trying to be strong but I can't I just keep bursting into floods of tears come visit me in my dream sweet heart love you.' Another friend, Sammie Derbyshire, wrote: 'RIP Hannah. You were the best and you never did anything to hurt anyone whatsoever, you was an amazing girl and cannot believe that u have gone.' Chloi Boden wrote: 'You was that type of girl who would say Hello to everyone you would pass in the street. The type of girl who I saw smiling ALL of the time.' Hannah's friends have planned to gather at Birkenhead Park this evening to release Chinese lanterns in memory of the teenager. Beauty spot: Hannah was discovered in undergrowth close to the historic Bidston Hill Observatory (above) three days after last being seen . Shocked neighbours and shopkeepers in the quiet village of Bidston said they were stunned as news broke of the grim discovery. Tracey McNoon said: 'It is just so sad - everyone in the area is just devastated. You just cannot believe it is on your own doorstep. All the customers who came in were devastated. 'I have two young girls myself but you do not think anything like this could ever happen.' Patrick William, who runs Hoylake Cafe, in nearby Hoylake Road, moved to the UK after fleeing the Taliban in his native Afghanistan. He said: 'I came here thinking it would be safe. That poor girl - she was just so young.' A resident living close to the park said: 'It is absolutely horrific that a teenage girl could be killed so brutally. 'It is just astonishing but we've been on at the council for some time to do something with the site as it is a magnet for teens drinking and taking drugs. 'There have been numerous problems. They hold parties down there and get up to all sorts of mischief.' Another resident said: 'I've been told someone had put up a tent and the girl's possessions were found inside with her body just a short distance away. It is just so shocking. No-one can really quite believe it.' Detective Inspector Mark Tivendale, of Merseyside Police, said: 'I would appeal to anyone who has any information which could help us with our inquiries to come forward and tell us. 'Hannah was first reported missing to police on Friday at 2.25pm and we understand that she was last seen on Wednesday afternoon. 'I am particularly interested in speaking to anyone who may have seen her since Wednesday to come forward as their information will help us to build up a picture of what happened to Hannah.

Jailed: Rostam Ahmadi, 23, launched a savage and random attack on Umesh Chaudhari yards from his home . An illegal immigrant who battered a father-of-two to death with a brick after being released on bail for robbery was locked up indefinitely today. Rostam Ahmadi, 23, launched the savage random attack on 41-year-old Umesh Chaudhari just a few yards from the victim’s home in Croydon, south London. Mr Chaudhari’s horrified wife and children rushed out of their house to find Ahmadi repeatedly slamming a brick down on to his head. It took the combined strength of two neighbours to wrestle the attacker away from the victim and pin him down on the floor until the police arrived. But Mr Chaudhari had suffered multiple skull fractures and died in hospital of brain damage the following day. Ordering him to be detained under the Mental Health Act indefinitely, judge Richard Marks QC said: ‘The particular tragedy of these events is compounded by the fact is you should not even have been in this country.' Ahmadi claimed to be an 18-year-old refugee from Afghanistan but later said he was born in Iran in 1989. He claimed asylum in the UK in 2007 but was refused an extension of his leave to remain in October 2010. In February 2011 his appeal was dismissed and he should have left the country. But three months later on May 30 last year he robbed a woman walking across Mitcham Common in south London. Killed: Umesh Chaudhari was attacked just a few yards from his home and in front of his family in Croydon but died the following day . Manisha Bungsy noticed he was following her and headed for the nearest road while trying to phone her husband. He followed her and when she asked what he wanted he slapped her in the face, grabbed her phone and ran back on to the common. Ahmadi was arrested nearby and told police he was angry and had been drinking and smoking cannabis. He was released on bail and on July 6 last year attacked Mr Chaudhari as the victim left his house in Dennett Road. Mr Chaudhari, who had come to the UK from Nepal in 2003 to provide a better life for his children, worked 70 hours a week at Tesco in Addiscombe during the day and at a restaurant in the City of London at night. Wife Rekha Sah said in a statement that he left for work at Tesco’s earlier than usual to cover his boss’s shift. ‘The incident happened outside the neighbour’s house within five minutes of him leaving,’ she added. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow told the court: ‘Members of the public were awoken by sounds of running footsteps and then by screaming. ‘A neighbour looked out to see the defendant push the deceased over a wall. She then saw him take the victim by the neck. Killed: Mr Chaudhari was attacked as he left his house in Dennett Road, Croydon . ‘Umesh Chaudhari attempted to break free but the defendant picked up a brick and repeatedly struck the deceased over the head.’ Another neighbour ran out and pleaded with Ahmadi: ‘Stop it you are going to kill him’ but he continued his attack. Two neighbours then ran out to push Ahmadi off the victim and put him in a headlock. Ahmadi told them that if they did not let him go he was going to kill everyone, the Old Bailey heard. Mr Glasgow told how Mr Chaudhari’s wife and children also witnessed the attack after coming out of their house a few doors down. ‘The deceased’s son and daughter speak in moving terms of the effect upon them of witnessing the assault.’ Police officers arrived to find Ahmadi being restrained by three members of the public and Mr Chaudhari being cradled in the arms of his wife. Ahmadi later claimed he had no mental health issues although there were marks of self harm on his arm. The Old Bailey: The judge heard how Ahmadi was suffering from schizophrenia . In custody he was seen to punch the walls and heard saying: ‘Do you know why I punched someone, because of Allah and jihad.’ Psychiatrists later diagnosed Ahmadi as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Ahmadi, of Dennett Road, Croydon, was charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. He has previous convictions for battery and theft in 2010 and criminal damage in April 2011. Judge Marks said: ‘Umesh Chaudhari was a good man. He was in every way a fine upstanding member of the community and a devoted family man. ‘Having picked up a brick you repeatedly struck him with that brick over the head. His screams alerted his wife and children who came out of the house and saw him in a dreadful state. ‘The loss suffered by his wife and children cannot be overstated. The pain they have had to endure is difficult to comprehend. ‘It is clear you continue to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia although you are responding to treatment. I have do doubt whatsoever that it was your very serious illness that explains how and why you did what you did.’ Mr Chaudhari's wife said in a victim impact statement that her husband’s death had left the family devastated. ‘I lost my loving husband and my children lost their loving and caring father. Umesh had many dreams about our future. ‘My children have found it difficult to concentrate on their studies. We had to move because of the bad memories. ‘Umesh was the sole earner in the family. I feel I will not be able to fund my children’s education. Life has been tough without Umesh. ‘Umesh was a friendly person and got on well with everyone. He was popular at work. He was very hardworking and a religious man and he had a good sense of humour. ‘Due to his murder I feel very vulnerable and I fear for my children’s safety when they leave the house.’","The judge said: 'The particular tragedy .

Prosecutors have released jailhouse phone calls from George Zimmerman to his wife Shellie that show she knew the couple had access to $135,000 from a legal defense fund -- despite her testimony at a bail hearing that the couple were broke. The audio tapes, which are made . whenever an inmate at the Seminole County Jail places a call, also show . that Zimmerman told his wife to buy bulletproof vests for him, for her and for . their lawyer, Mark O'Mara. 'As uncomfortable as it is, I want you wearing one,' Zimmerman says. Mrs Zimmerman also talks about a 'safety counselor,' who is apparently helping the couple on security measures. Zimmerman says he has received thousands of death threats since the shooting. Accused of lying: George Zimmerman was re-arrested in June and his wife Shellie was charged after prosecutors accused them of not telling the truth about $135,000 they had collected from a legal defense fund . He also joked about having a hoodie to help him hide his face and slip out of jail about he posted bail. Travyon Martin, famously, was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when Zimmerman shot him in the chest in February. Zimmerman . is currently behind bars after he was re-arrested on June 3 when a . judge revoked his bail. He posted $150,000 in April after he was charged . with second-degree murder in the February killing of 17-year-old . Trayvon. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to the charges and says he acted in self-defense because he was being beaten by the teen. His wife, Shellie, was arrested June . 12 on perjury charges. Prosecutors say she lied in court when she told a . judge that the couple had little cash to post for her husband's bail. Back in jail: Zimmerman is awaiting a second bond hearing after he turned himself in on June 3. He is hoping to be released again while he awaits trial . Phone call recordings and bank records prove she knew the couple had collected $135,000 in donations through a website they established to fund Zimmerman's legal defense, authorities say. Zimmerman learned that the donation website he set up had crashed because it had so many visitors. 'Wow, that is awesome. Those people need to start vocalizing themselves,' Zimmerman tells his wife. The six recordings made public on by State Attorney Angela Corey, the special prosecutor on the case, show Zimmerman and his wife appeared to be speaking in code in an attempt to conceal their discussion about finances. He refers to the PayPal account that had collected $135,000 in donations as 'Peter Pan.' The couple furtively talk about Zimmerman's 'account,' but don't refer directly to the PayPal donations. Bank records that were also released on Monday show several electronic transfers that were made between the PayPal, Zimmerman's credit union account and Mrs Zimmerman's account. Statement: Travyon Martin's death made hoodies famous because the teen was wearing one when Zimmerman shot him . She used several transactions, all less than $10,000, to move about $85,000 into her bank account so she could pay the bail, prosecutors say. The couple also talk about their life after the trial. 'After all this is over, you're going to be able to have a great life,' Mrs Zimmerman says. 'We're will,' Zimmerman responds. 'Yeah, we will,' she says . 'I'm excited,' Zimmerman replies. He faces life in prison, if convicted of murdering Trayvon. The comment about the hoodie came as the couple discussed how Zimmerman would escape from the gaggle of TV cameras after his release from jail. 'We could have two cars, we could have two rented cars,' Zimmerman said. His wife suggests they switch the vehicles at a parking garage at the airport. She also raises the possibility of using SUVs with tinted windows to hide her husband inside. 'Well, I have my hoodie,' he responds. Zimmerman's lawyer said the couple misrepresented their finances because they were scared of the national attention they had received over the murder charges. A second bond hearing is scheduled for June 29, where the judge will decide whether to give Zimmerman the chance to be released from jail again.","Six audio recordings made while Zimmerman spoke to his wife from jail were released by prosecutors on Monday .

Egypts' army generals made a last minute grab for power yesterday as Islamists claimed to have won the presidential election. The country’s military rulers have issued a constitutional decree to limit the influence of the new president at the same time as granting the army sweeping legislative authority – even permitting generals to control the budget. The move threatens to undermine the election battle between Islamist Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood and Ahmed Shafiq, who served as prime minister under Mubarak. Victory: Presidential candidate Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood waves to a crowd . Morsi, 60, declared victory as votes . were still being counted, with his campaign team saying he had won 52 . per cent of the vote and Shafiq had 48 per cent. If confirmed, the results would see the leader of an Islamist group become the first democratically-elected president of Egypt. A spokesman for the Shafiq campaign . instead said the former air force commander was ahead with around 51 per . cent of the vote. No results are expected to be announced until . Thursday. Gunfight: Israeli police and soldiers detained an Arab-Israeli after he tried to pass a road block . Looking: Israel is still hunting for four gunmen who infiltrated the Egyptian border and staged a deadly ambush . Unclear: There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, about 18 miles from the Gaza Strip . Worries: The incident raised Israeli concern about lawlessness in Egypt's Sinai desert since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 . Last night, the US government voiced its concern over the military powers. State Department spokesman Victoria . Nuland said: ‘This is a critical moment in Egypt, and the world is . watching closely. We are particularly concerned by decisions that appear . to prolong the military’s hold on power.’ Pentagon press secretary George . Little said the US would urge military leaders ‘to relinquish power to . civilian elected authorities and to respect the universal rights of the . Egyptian people and the rule of law’. Many have described the actions of . the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, which has ruled Egypt since the . fall of President Hosni Mubarak, as a military coup. Last week, a constitutional court . believed to favour the generals ruled that the country’s . Islamist-dominated parliament – which was democratically elected into . office – must be dissolved. The justice ministry also imposed a . de facto martial law granting the military police extensive powers to . arrest civilians for non-military crimes. As well as handing the military . legislative power until a new parliament is elected, the decree also . ensures the army remains unaccountable and grants it the right to . oversee the writing of a new constitution. Protest: Egyptians gathered to demonstrate in Tahrir Square last week in the run up to the election . Egyptian stocks opened lower today after the election brought the country no closer to the stable democracy promised by its interim military rulers. The uncertain outcome of the vote, billed as the last step in an army-managed transition to democracy, is the latest in a series of false starts. It has left investors swinging between optimism and despondency since the overthrow of autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak in February last year. Sixteen months since Mubarak's departure, the country lacks a functioning government with popular backing to replace a hapless, unpopular interim cabinet and embark on reforms to prop up a struggling economy. After posting the world's best stock market performance between January and March following a smooth parliamentary vote, Egypt's benchmark share index has dropped 20 per cent. Major General Mohammed al-Assar, a . senior member of the ruling council, told a press conference yesterday . that the army would hand over power to a civil state by June 30. Meanwhile three were killed in a gunfight on the Israeli/Egyptian border today. Militants . fired on an Israeli crew building a border barrier on the frontier, . killing one of the workers - while Israeli soldiers shot dead two of the . infiltrators. The incident raised Israeli concern about lawlessness in Egypt's Sinai desert. 'We . can see a disturbing deterioration in Egypt's control of the Sinai's . security,' Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said, commenting on the . attack. He added, in reference to a 1979 peace treaty with Israel: 'We are waiting for the election results. 'Whoever wins, we expect him to take responsibility over all of Egypt's international commitments.' The scream: A man walks in front of a wall representing the Syrisa revolution in Cairo . Hosni Mubarak, pictured as he was sentenced, was toppled in an Arab Spring uprising last year . Israeli . military spokesman Yoav Mordechai said: 'A terrorist squad opened fire . and possibly also fired an anti-tank rocket at an area where (Israel) is . constructing the border fence.' An Israeli military source said one of the workmen, an Arab citizen of Israel, was killed by the gunmen. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, about 18 miles from the Gaza Strip. Soldiers who rushed to the scene . killed two of the militants and searched the Israeli side of the border . for more gunmen, the source said. To . curb an influx of African migrants and boost security, Israel is . building a fence along the frontier with Egypt that it hopes to complete . by the end of the year. The barrier will run most of the 165 miles from Eilat, on the Red Sea, up to the Gaza Strip. In . the most serious attack in the area since the Egyptian popular . uprising, militants crossed over the Egyptian border and killed eight . Israelis in August 2011. On . Saturday, at least two rockets were fired deep into southern Israel, . causing no damage or casualties. It was not clear whether they were . launched from Gaza or Sinai. Palestinian . militants in the Gaza Strip, ruled by Islamist Hamas, have launched . Grad rockets at Israel from the coastal territory in the past. Israel also says militants have also crossed into Sinai to launch similar attacks on its territory. Protests held in Cairo's Tahrir Square have become commonplace since the uprising last year .","Militants fired on Israeli crew building border barrier on the frontier .

Tragic: Fiona Geraghty, 14, who was bulimic, hanged herself after being taunted about her weight . The fashion industry’s obsession with ‘wafer-thin’ models should be held ‘directly responsible’ for the death of a public schoolgirl, a  coroner said yesterday. Fiona Geraghty, 14, who was bulimic, hanged herself after being taunted about her weight. In a scathing attack, coroner Michael Rose blamed magazine images for  turning a ‘bright and bubbly girl’, who loved singing and horse-riding, into a  teenager gripped by ‘mental turmoil’. He said Fiona had died because of the ‘perception, prompted by the fashion industry’, that she should be thinner. Calling it ‘one of the most tragic cases to come before me in 40 years’, he added: ‘The one class of person who is not here, whom I hold directly responsible for what happened, is the fashion industry. ‘The problem of eating disorders in young girls didn’t exist before the 1970s. It was from that point on that the fashion industry, the magazines that supported it and the models, promoted the thin figure. Outside court: Dr Elspeth Geraghty and Dr John Geraghty pictured after the inquest today where they said their lives had been 'blown apart' by when their daughter Fiona was found dead in July last year . ‘I ask for magazines in the fashion . industry to stop publishing photographs of wafer-thin girls.  For their . vanity, families like this suffer. ‘It is an increasing problem  and, until they control themselves, tragedies like this will continue.’ The . inquest heard that Fiona, a pupil at £18,000-a-year King’s College in . Taunton, Somerset, was a ‘delightful’ and gifted girl from a ‘close and . loving family’. But the ‘sunny child’, who  loved horses and the outdoors, struggled to settle at her school. In . February last year, King’s  College contacted Fiona’s parents to tell . them that their daughter had been bingeing on chocolate and crisps . before vomiting. Loved: Fiona was described by an aunt as a 'beautiful, sunny child who had everything going for her' The . teenager later told her doctor she had started making herself  sick . following taunts from other schoolgirls about her weight. She was taken to see Ross Gillanders, a community psychiatric nurse with Somerset NHS Trust. Help: Fiona saw a community psychiatric nurse on four occasions before she was discharged just two weeks before she committed suicide, the Taunton hearing was told . However, after just four sessions, he sent her home on May 5 last year after judging her risk of suicide to be one out of ten. Two months later, on July 14, Fiona hanged herself at her home in Nailsbourne near Taunton. After . her death it was revealed she had written an essay in which she . referred to her ‘self-loathing’ and bulimia, which the school had failed . to pass on to her family. Richard . Biggs, headmaster of King’s College, told the inquest that eating . disorders had become an ‘increasing cause for concern’ at the school. He . said one sixth form girl had become so ill she was unable to return, . while another in the fifth form lost so much weight  that she had to be . treated at the school’s medical centre. Returning . a verdict of misadventure, Mr Rose said he could not be ‘certain’ Fiona . had wanted to end her own life and it may have been ‘a cry for help’ that went wrong. After . the verdict, Fiona’s mother, Dr Elspeth Geraghty, a GP, and father John, . a hospital consultant, said their ‘lives had been blown apart’ by the . teenager’s death. ‘It is something no parent should go through,’ they added. ‘Eating disorders are common and one in 25 sufferers die as a result. ‘We . feel the diagnosis and treatment by the Child and Adolescent Mental . Health Services was inadequate. Had she received their improved services . Fiona would still be here with us.’ Alison . Chisholm, of the Somerset Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, . said: ‘The majority referred with eating disorders were from private . schools. ‘We are not . sure what the reasons are, but there has been a significant increase in . the rates and complexity of the disorders. Children are more ill when . they come to us.’ For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org .

Married to one of the world’s most famous and controversial media tycoons it may come as little surprise that Wendi Deng Murdoch practises tough love with her children. Now Mrs Murdoch has been revealed as a fan of ‘Tiger Mom’ Amy Chua - even emailing the author to request a play date for their four daughters to meet, The New York Times reported. Just before the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, ran an excerpt from Chua’s child-rearing manual, 'Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,' Mrs Murdoch fired Chua an email suggesting a get-together. Tough love: Wendi Murdoch, left, has been outed as a fan of 'Tiger Mom' Amy Chua, right. The author says that they both parent in 'almost identical' ways . 'She wanted her daughters to come to New Haven and meet my daughters,' the controversial author told the paper. Despite an age gap – Ms Chua’s daughters Sophia and Lula are 19 and 16 respectively while Chloe and Grace are 10 and 8, the girls share common ground. All four girls are fluent in Chinese and English and have Chinese mothers who adhere to strict parenting methods. Get over it: When Chua was vilified for her controversial strict parenting Mrs Murdoch told her to 'get over' the criticism . Indeed, at their first meeting Mrs Murdoch turned to Ms Chua for advice, including how to get a child to do piano practice for more than an hour a day, the Tiger Mom told the paper. ‘She parents almost identically to the way I do,' 49-year-old Ms Chua said. Ms Chua, a Yale law professor, shot to fame after her parenting manual was published in 2011. In it, she described her efforts to give her two daughters a traditional strict 'Chinese' upbringing and argues that 'Western' parents put the self-esteem of their children before academic success. She was vilified for her super-strict parenting style which includes banning sleepovers and television and never accepting a grade lower than an A. No stranger to a public backlash, Mrs Murdoch was on hand to offer Ms Chua some hard-hitting advice – ‘get over it’. 'She was like: ""Why do you care what people think? You have two wonderful daughters. Get over it,""' Ms.Chua recalled to the New York Times. While she may not have seemed particularly sympathetic Rupert Murdoch’s third wife was, presumably empathetic. Almost four decades younger than her husband Mrs Murdoch, 43, has been labelled - amongst other insults - a 'gold digger' since the couple wed in 1999. Strict styles: Both Amy Chua, pictured left with her family, and Wendi Murdoch, right with her daughters Chloe, right and Grace, left, believe in strict parenting styles . No stranger to criticism: Almost four decades younger than her husband Mrs Murdoch, 43, has been labelled - amongst other insults - a 'gold digger' since the couple wed in 1999 . However, opinion on Mrs Murdoch as a mere ‘trophy wife’ seemed to shift last July during her husband’s testimony before a British parliamentary subcommittee over the phone hacking scandal. Mrs Murdoch - now famously - sprang from her chair, hitting protester wielding a piebefore he could attack her husband. Fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, an old friend of Mrs Murdoch’s, was not surprised to see her leap into the fray for her husband. 'Nothing characterizes her more than that moment. She is protective and fierce and not afraid of anything,' she told the New York Times. However Mrs Murdoch is more than her 81-year-old husband’s unlikely look-out and continues to carve out a career of her own, including projects in the film business. Her first film, 'Snow Flower and the Secret Fan', which she produced with Florence Sloan, the Chinese wife of ex-MGM studio chief Harry E. Sloan, came out last year. Society girls: Arianna Huffington, left, recalls a humorous toast that Mrs Murdoch made lamenting the vegan food on offer at a party the two women hosted in Manhattan last year . Poor sales figures – it only took about $11 million worldwide – can partly be attributed to timing. The film release came just as revelations surfaced that her husband’s newspaper – News of the World – had hacked into the voice mail of missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who was later discovered to have been murdered. Now Mrs Murdoch, again pairing up with Mrs Sloan, is preparing to sign a deal with Sony Pictures for her second movie project. This one is about the Chinese pianist Lang Lang. Despite her fierce ambition – and strict parenting style – Mrs Murdoch can display a sharp sense of humour, according to Arianna Huffington. When the two high-flying women hosted guests, including Joel Klein and Harvey Weinstein, at a book launch in Manhattan last year Mrs Murdoch was miffed at the vegan food on offer. Speaking to the New York Times, Ms Huffington recalled the toast Mrs Murdoch gave: 'She said, ""I grew up so poor in China that one day I aspired to have meat regularly. Now that I can have meat three times a day, Kathy tells us we can’t have any meat at all."" '","Wendi Murdoch emailed 'Tiger Mom' author Amy Chua requesting for their daughters to have a play date .

He went on to escape from a Prisoner of War Camp in Salzburg, Austria, and along with his VC, he was later presented with the silver-gilt punch bowl by his former regiment. The 10lbs bowl that stands on a plinth at 20 inches tall, has been passed down through his family and is now being sold.

War hero: The flight-lieutenant, right, and his mother. He died in 1968 and his silver bowl has been passed down through the family ever since . Auctioneers at Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, Wilts, have given it a pre-sale estimate of £12,000. Rupert Slingsby, from the auctioneers, said: 'The bowl is a fine Edwardian piece that would probably be worth about £4,000 but because of its association with a VC hero it could go for three times that sum. 'Alan Jerrard was the winner of the so-called ""Pyjama VC"" and his story is one of the most remarkable of World War I. 'He enjoyed the distinction of being the only aerial Victoria Cross recipient of the long and bitter campaign fought on the Italian Front during World War I. 'In October 1917 Italy was in need of desperate military assistance against the Austro-Hungarian empire. 'Despite numerous RAF operations including many dogfights, only one VC was awarded for action in the air during that final year-long phase of the campaign. Veteran: Flight Lieutenant Alan Jerrard, 20, who escaped from a Prisoner of War Camp in Salzburg, Austria, during World War I . 'On March 30, 1918 Jerrard shot down three enemy planes and launched a courageous attack, flying as low as 50 feet, on an enemy aerodrome, successfully strafing planes as they tried to take off. 'He only withdrew when ordered to do so by his patrol leader and he was then pursued by five enemy aircraft. 'However he crash-landed west of Mansue aerodrome, where he was captured and later interrogated by the enemy. 'When Jerrard was captured, he was wearing only his pyjamas beneath his bulky flying suit. 'That morning the weather had been unsuitable for flying. When Jerrard was suddenly ordered up, he had been asleep and had to dress so rapidly that he simply pulled his flying overalls over his pyjamas.' Fl Lt Jerrard died at his home in Lyme Regis, Dorset in 1968. His exploits and those of his fellow Royal Flying Corps pilots were carried out without the benefit of parachutes, which were not introduced for aviators until the very end of the war. The silver punch bowl, that is decorated with cherubs and has lion heads as handles, is inscribed: 'To Lieutenant Alan JErrard, V.C., the first Member of the Staffordshire territorial force to Win the Honour. '...in recognition of a great service and in appreciation of a very gallant action.' The sale takes place on July 18 in Salisbury.","Flight Lieutenant Alan Jerrard, 20, shot down two enemy planes before gunning down another that was on the tail of a comrade .

An extensive landfill search for a missing five-year-old which cost more than $750,000 ended this week with no trace of the girl's body. Jhessye Shockley, from Glendale, Arizona, has been missing since October last year and her mother Jerice Hunter remains the chief suspect. Despite the four-and-a-half month search turning up nothing, Jhessye's family and police say they have not given up hope of finding her remains or of pursuing the case against her mother, who is currently behind bars. Scroll down for videos . Missing: Jhessye Shockley has been missing since October 11 and police now believe she was dead before even being reported missing . The search was expected to last up to six weeks but instead continued for almost five months . According to The Republic, some of the girl's family gathered on Monday at the landfill south of the Valley to say goodbye. They hugged and thanked officers who spent weeks sifting through roughly 9,500 tons of compressed trash. One searcher even brought flowers as police strongly believe that the landfill is Jhessye's final resting place. Lisa Vance, a family member who helped raise the girl, told The Republic: 'We're . not going to be able to go to a cemetery to visit Jhessye or leave . flowers. Now we're just waiting for justice for Jhessye.' Assistant Police Chief Rick St John apologized to the family for not being able to find Jhessye's body. He said: 'We ask for your forgiveness. We wanted to find Jhessye and bring her home. We were unable to do that. 'Our resolve, our commitment, our conviction is to (prove she was murdered).' According to a court document, Jhessye's 13-year-old sister told police her mother kept the girl in a closet, and that Jhessye had black eyes, cuts and bruises before she was reported . missing. The teen recounted an incident just weeks earlier when Hunter returned home to find Jhessye wearing a . long T-shirt while watching TV with a boy. She told the girl . that she was a 'ho' before taking her into a bedroom, according to the . document. Massive site: Search teams sifted through 6,000 tons of trash for the body . Hopeful: Police say they know the exact date the body was dumped and where and were hopeful they would be able to find the remains . The teen said she could hear her sister screaming and crying in the room, the document said. She also told police that Hunter kept . Jhessye in a bedroom closet and deprived her of food and water, according to the document. '(She) reported that Jhessye's hair . had been pulled out and described Jhessye as not looking alive and that . she looked like a zombie,' it said. '(She) said that the . closet where Jhessye had been looked like a grave and smelled like dead . people.' The teen said Hunter placed incense in a container to conceal the odor. She also said that a few days before . Jhessye disappeared, her mother spent the entire day cleaning the . apartment and cleaning her shoes from the closet with soap and bleach. Police said they found a receipt that showed Hunter bought food and a . bottle of bleach two days before she reported her daughter missing. In court: Jhessye's mother Jerice Hunter is the primary focus of the investigation. She appeared in court on child abuse charges and is held on a $100,000 bail . Hunter was arrested on a felony count . of child abuse, more than five weeks after she reported Jhessye's disappearance. Hunter was held on a $100,000 bond and has appeared in court, where she has protested her innocence. Hunter claims she went out for an errand and left the girl in the . care of three older siblings at their apartment. AZCentral.com reported the sister said the last time she saw Jhessye . was September 12. The report says school records indicate Jhessye's last . day at school was September 22. Police have said they no longer expect to find the five-year-old alive. A spokesman told the Arizona Republic that authorities are determined to search as long as it takes to find the body. 'Cruel parents': Jerice Hunter (left) was also arrested on earlier child abuse charges in October 2005 with then-husband, George . Shockley, (right) 'That means ripping every single bag, going through everything,' said the spokesman. Police told ABC15.com that 40 people will work eight hours a day on the operation. Glendale Police Chief Steve Conrad added: 'We would love nothing more than to find . Jhessye and hold the person who is responsible for her death . accountable. I feel we owe . that to her, her family and the community.' Police were unable to recover bodies during two searches of the same landfill in the late 90s. Lisa Vance, who helped raise the girl while her mother served time in prison for child abuse, told The Republic: 'I'm very confident that when they go out there, however many days it takes, they are going to find Jhessye. They just have to.' But Hunter's attorney, Scott Maasen, expressed surprise that authorities had not launched the search sooner. Worrying: Jhessye vanished from her hometown of Glendale without a trace . 'They said almost two months ago they . were possibly going to search the landfill,' he said. 'It begs the . question, why has there been a delay for so long?' Police claim they spent recent months figuring out the specific day they believe the body was dumped so a search would be more successful. Hunter, whom police have named as a 'number one' interest in the case, has also been critical of the investigation into finding her daughter: . She said in December: 'We feel that law enforcement is not . active in finding Jhessye and that they're more active in persecuting me . instead of finding out where she is.

Victims of crime will be told to go to Tesco to get help as the shutters . at more than one in five police stations are brought down to cut costs. Chief constables will close 264 public counters over the next three years as they battle to balance the books. Residents will instead be encouraged to travel to supermarkets, . libraries and community centres if they want to speak to officers . face-to-face. Savings: 'Shared locations', like Rainham Police Office in a Tesco car park in Essex, will replace stations . A further 179 police buildings which have no public access will be sold off in an unprecedented fire sale of assets. Senior officers argued that the blow of the police station closures will . be softened as 137 so-called ‘shared locations’ open their doors. They highlighted how many buildings were out of date and said fewer . people visit police stations as they turn to the phone and internet. Some forces, such as Kent, Surrey, Essex, Cumbria and Gwent, were . already using mobile police stations in supermarket car parks. But critics have accused police of withdrawing from landmark high street buildings in many towns and cities simply to cut costs. Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, lashed out at forces . for closing ‘places of refuge’ for crime victims. He said: ‘These . drop-in centres are no substitute for a proper police station and for a . lot of people they are not the answer. Axe: 5,800 frontline police officers face the axe over the next three years because of Government spending cuts . ‘In many cases they have taken away a police station and given the . public a part-time office in a supermarket or a mobile home left in a . car park. ‘The public want a police station with full facilities, a place of . refuge and safety. What we are doing is abandoning this and providing a . drop-in point instead.’ The closures were disclosed yesterday in a report by a police watchdog . into how police forces in England and Wales are coping with tighter . budgets. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found crime continues to fall . and confidence in police remains high despite substantial cuts in . government funding. Its report said the total police workforce will fall by 32,400 officers and staff by 2015. Among these will be 5,800 frontline officers although many forces have . reorganised to put a larger proportion of bobbies on the beat. However, Paul McKeever, of the Police Federation, argued that some . forces have simply created a ‘smokescreen’ by moving officers to the . front line from other important roles. He added: ‘Whichever way you cut it, the resilience of the police . service to be able to react to whatever is thrown at it is being . threatened.’ Funding black hole: The Metropolitan Police still have to make a further £233million worth of funding cuts . Spending on equipment and services will also be cut by about £474million . as chief constables look to reorganise and share contracts to save . cash. Sir Denis O’Connor, Chief Inspector of Constabulary, argued that  forces . can save the jobs of dozens of police officers by selling off costly . buildings. He said: ‘The police station and front counter have traditionally been the physical mainstay of forces’ presence in communities. ‘However, the potential savings benefit to a force in shrinking its . estate can be considerable. One reports it will save £500,000 in 2013/14 . rising to £1.6million in 2014/15.’ He said the frontline officers he . has met are ‘cracking on with the mission’, working imaginatively to . maintain services whatever difficulties they face. The latest cuts figures do not include Britain’s biggest force, the Met, . which has not produced detailed budget plans or officer numbers. Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is reassembling his management team . following a string of  resignations and a shake-up of how the force is . overseen.

Facing jail: Karl Lang, pictured, has been warned he could be sent to prison for the crimes against vulnerable young women . A psychic who convinced vulnerable young women to strip to improve their chances of contacting the dead has been warned he faces a jail term after being found guilty. Karl Lang, 49, was convicted of causing women to engage in sexual activity without consent - in one case telling a victim to 'perform like a porn star'. The rogue medium targeted two women in their 20s who sought him out in the belief he could contact dead relatives. A jury at Newport Crown Court found him guilty of all 12 charges today, dismissing claims that he was an innocent spiritualist instructor. Judge Patrick Curran QC agreed to grant Lang bail to ‘get his affairs in order’ until a sentencing hearing next month. But he warned: ‘This involved a very serious breach of trust, and an immediate custodial sentence is, it seems to me, absolutely inevitable.’ He described Lang’s activity as ‘systematic conduct and a breach of trust involving two very vulnerable young women’. He added that they were 'vulnerable in the sense that they were bereaved and sought the defendant’s consultation in communicating with those who died, and he took the most gross advantage of the situation'. The jury agreed he was essentially a predator who targeted vulnerable women who turned to him with hope while at their lowest ebb. He operated by offering his victims spiritual training as mediums, claiming it would boost their own psychic powers. Once under his spell they were manipulated into stripping off and effectively acting out raunchy sex shows for his private gratification. Both young women were also encouraged to take naked photographs of themselves and send them to his phone. Lang, of Newport, South Wales, vehemently denied the claims, dismissing them during the trial as ‘wicked lies’. Guilty: Lang, of Newport, South Wales, was found guilty at Newport Crown Court, pictured, of 12 charges causing women to engage in sexual activity without consent during séance sessions . He claimed he had been shocked when one young woman stripped off during a spiritualist session. In interview he told police that 'letting go' was key to success in . spiritualism and if that is what they wanted to do 'it was their . problem'. He told the jury he could see, hear and communicate with spirits from the other side, and had done so since the age of four. He also claimed he had sought out a spiritualist church in Newport after a spirit attacked him at home in 1999. From then on, he claimed, his powers increased and he performed to crowds of up to 1,000 at spiritualist churches across the UK. Despite his insight into the world of . the departed, the outcome of his trial today shows he failed to foresee . where his behaviour would ultimately lead. During his trial one of his victims, . aged 26, told how she felt ‘embarrassed and ashamed’ that she was fooled . into taking part in nude séances. Giving . evidence by live video link to avoid seeing 49-year-old Lang in the . dock, she said she had been desperate to make contact with her . grandfather. Describing Lang’s method of improving . her spiritual power, she said: ‘To get stronger, he told me I had to do . things that mankind was afraid of. ‘This meant I had to get naked and . perform a bit like a porn star. He said the more outrageous I performed, . the stronger I would become.’ The . woman, who first visited Lang when she was 19, carried on the sessions . for more than three years, during which time she was instructed on . reaching higher levels of ability, described in terms of ‘levels’ and . ‘colours’. She said: ‘If you . didn’t dance to his tune, all hell would break loose. Bad things would . happen. I’d lose my colours if I didn’t do what he wanted.’ The . woman continued: ‘Thinking about it now it makes me feel sick. I’m . embarrassed and ashamed about what I had to do, but I was completely . controlled. He mentally abused me. ‘I . met Karl at a very vulnerable stage in my life. He made me feel . special. His eyes were warming and he made me feel safe and comfortable. I saw Karl as my saviour.’ She . added: ‘After Karl was arrested, he rang me and begged me not to say . anything. He said, “I’m big time in the s***, please don’t hang me”.’ The . other victim, now 27, said: ‘The first time I stripped off my clothes . he said “Well done! You’ve gone up a level in the spiritual world”. He . told me the more outrageous I behaved, the higher level I would get. It . was like a reward system.’ On one occasion after obeying his . sexually explicit instructions, she told the court: ‘Karl congratulated . me by saying: “I didn’t think you had it in you – you really pleased the . spirit world”. I felt uncomfortable.’ She added: ‘He asked me to talk about . my sexual fantasies during meditations. I would be naked with my eyes . closed. He told me to imagine having sex. He said: “Be as outrageous as . you want, don’t just have one man, have five”.’ The victim contacted Lang in . an attempt to get in touch with her father, who died ten years ago. She . later told police she felt ‘brainwashed, manipulated and groomed’. The court heard that Lang had warned . the woman not to tell anyone about his methods because he was the . ‘reincarnation of Jesus Christ’.","Medium Karl Lang released on bail after judge warned him to a length custodial sentence is 'absolutely inevitable'

A crooked bank worker stole £80,000 from a customer's account and transferred the money to struggling businesses which were failing to repay the loans he had agreed. Former HSBC worker Peter Nudd has been jailed after stealing thousands of pounds from the bank. Peter Nudd, 50, also took nearly £50,000 from the same account to spend on takeaways and Butlin's holidays. Nudd dragged a total of 51 businesses into his crooked scheme. In the worst case, he plundered £131,000 from one customer and moved £80,000 into the accounts of ailing businesses who were failing to repay the loans he had rubber-stamped. HSBC's total losses are estimated at more than £200,000. Nudd was a high-flying commercial manager at HSBC's offices in Meridian Business Park, Norwich. The crook kept some of the businesses affected in the dark by sending them false bank statements. Nudd, of Martham, Norfolk, was jailed for two years at Norwich Crown Court yesterday. He admitted one charge of theft and three of false accounting. Nudd also asked for 46 other crimes of false accounting to be dealt with by the court. The devastated married father-of-one released a statement afterwards saying that his crimes would 'haunt him for ever.' He said: 'I never thought it would continue for this long and I have struggled to come to terms with this whole chapter in my life. 'I'm glad to be out of the bank and will draw a line under this to move on with my future. He added: 'We have had little if any benefit from this and are in a very difficult financial place. 'I love my family and I hope they forgive me for putting them under huge financial strain.'Nudd began moving money around the bank's clients in 2004, thinking he would soon be detected. But his false accounting continued until February 2011 when a firm called Enviroserve queried why £18,164 had been taken out of its account in three payments. HSBC brought in an investigator. They found Nudd had moved thousands of pounds from wealthy to failing firms who he had approved for loans, but could not pay the bank back. When questioned, Nudd, who joined the bank in 1980, admitted he had been 'spinning plates' by moving the sums around the bank's clients. HSBC's loss is estimated at £222,000. Ross Burrows, defending, told the court: 'It does have hallmarks of a Robin Hood story, but I think it is more a case of banking pressures which Mr Nudd found himself put under.' Mr Burrows said Nudd had been out of his depth after being promoted to commercial manager in 2002 and had contemplated suicide after being caught. Peter Nudd treated his family to trips to Butlin's using the stolen cash. 'This is an extremely unusual case,' he said. 'He just assumed from the outset when he transferred these funds that it would be picked up immediately.' Nudd had not flaunted the £49,000 he had banked and continued to live in a terraced house and drive a humble Vauxhall Astra. But Martin Ivory, prosecuting, branded his behaviour 'misguided, very foolish and unnecessary.' Mr Ivory said: 'A lot of the money moved round is either to cover his own incompetence or his own concerns.' Judge Nicholas Coleman told Nudd: 'You were in a position where you assumed a high level of trust. 'We know only too well in this day and age the public expects confidence in those responsible for the management of their financial affairs.' Despite the deception lasting for seven years, HSBC insisted last night it had 'processes in place' to uncover fraud. A bank spokesman said: 'As soon as any fraudulent activity is identified, we always inform the relevant authorities and in this case the bank has worked closely with Norfolk Police and provided appropriate support. 'The bank also has a number of processes in place to enable members of staff to raise and discuss any concerns they have about their role.' The court ordered Nudd to pay a nominal sum of £1 under the proceeds of crime act.","HSBC costs estimated at £200,000 .

Windfall: Kimberly Smedley earned at least $1.3 million from her illegal butt enhancement business, where she injected clients with industrial silicone . An unlicensed cosmetic surgeon who pleaded guilty to administering industrial silicone buttock injections made at least $1.3 million from her nationwide practice, federal prosecutors believe. Kimberly Smedley, 45, faces up to five years in prison for operating her illegal practice out of hotel rooms in Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York. Ahead of her sentencing on Thursday on a  federal conspiracy charge, prosecutors said a forensic accountant's . review of Smedley's bank accounts found $1.513 million in receipts . related to the practice. She kept the silicone in a water jug for the procedures - and used 'super glue with cotton balls to prevent silicone leaking out' of the women's flesh. She charged '$500 and $1,600, always in cash, for . each session where she typically injected silicone in nine places on each . side of the buttocks', according to court papers. She ordered nearly 5,000 pounds of silicone from one manufacturer alone, The Smoking Gun reported. Smedley, from Atlanta, Georgia, told . clients that the silicone was medical grade. However it was actually . intended for metal or plastic lubrication, as an additive for paint and . coatings, and furniture or automotive polishes, according to Baltimore . district court. The therapist offered to inject the chemical 'into the buttocks of customers for larger and fuller buttocks in exchange for money' according to The Smoking Gun.  Many of her customers between 2003 and 2011 were strippers. Lavish life: Smedley, 45, (with unidentified male) charged $500 to $1,600 each time for silicone injections . She had used her earnings to fund a . lavish lifestyle, driving a luxury SUV and living in an exclusive . Altanta neighbourhood where homes are worth around $500,000. Smedley . was investigated last year after one woman fell seriously ill from . receiving silicone injections. She was arrested at a hotel in Washington . D.C. as she was preparing to see customers. In 2008 investigation by the New York Post, Smedley said: 'I can't tell if you'll have scars or not. You have to know your . own body. You need to be sure of what you're doing. I'm not promising . anything.' Illegal silicone injections, often . used by sex workers and those in the transgender community to alter . their appearance, are incredibly dangerous and even life-threatening. Makeshift practice: Smedley reportedly saw clients in hotel rooms across the U.S. to administer injections including this one in downtown Washington D.C. Dr . M.R. Khalifeh, a plastic surgeon, told Fox: 'We see . long-term effects six months to a year later. The silicone can bubble . to the surface and cause chronic infections.
