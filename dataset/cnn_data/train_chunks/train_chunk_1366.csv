"Barack Obama last night agreed to ‘prioritise’ the case of the last British resident held in Guantanamo Bay after David Cameron raised his plight in talks at the White House. Sources said the US President had acknowledged the ‘importance’ of speeding up consideration of Shaker Aamer for release to the UK in talks at the White House. The Prime Minister cautioned it would take time to secure Mr Aamer’s return, but said President Obama was committed to closing the controversial detention camp established by George W Bush before leaving office in 2016. ‘Obviously I’ve raised this case in the past. It’s important. I know that the policy of the US government to close Guantanamo Bay,’ the Prime Minister said. Shaker Aamer, pictured left, and again right with his children, is the only remaining British resident imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay . ‘So I think there is every opportunity... I hope to over time make some progress.’ Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the US National Security Council, said: ‘Prime Minister Cameron raised this case with the President, and the President told him that he understands why this case is of great interest to the Prime Minister and the British people. The President committed to the Prime Minister that we will prioritise this case, while making sure any action taken is consistent with our national security.’ Chances of an announcement of an intention to release Mr Aamer this week have been hampered by attempts by Republican Senators to limit releases from Guantanamo. They have objected to the accelerated pace of releases from the Cuban facility in recent months, particularly in the light of terrorist attacks in Paris. The hold-up in Mr Aamer’s release is understood to be because US authorities have cleared him for transfer to Saudi Arabia, but not the UK, despite him being resident in this country. British officials, however, are seeking to persuade the US that they can address any concerns about a return to London. Mr Cameron had been pressed to raise Mr Aamer’s case by MPs from across the political spectrum, including former Tory shadow home secretary David Davis, Lib Dem MP and former Home Office minister Norman Baker, and Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn. Celebrity backers of a campaign to secure his release include Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, TV presenter Janet Ellis and her singer daughter Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and the actress Juliet Stevenson. Prime Minister David Cameron and President Barack Obama walk together at the White House, where they discussed the plight of British resident Shaker Aamer, who remains imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay . Mr Aamer is the only British resident to remain jailed at Guantanamo Bay (pictured). He has been held at the jail without charge for 13 years . Mr Aamer, who lived in south London with his wife and four children, was picked up in Afghanistan in 2002 and accused of being an ally of Osama bin Laden, a claim he strenuously denies. Though he has never faced any charge, he has been held by the US for 13 years. The Mail revealed last week that Mr Cameron intended to raise Mr Aamer’s plight in talks with President Obama at the White House. Mr Cameron sought to reassure the US President about Britain’s readiness to have Mr Aamer back, having already accepted 14 former Guantanamo residents – more than the whole of the rest of Europe. ‘The Prime Minister understands that the closure of Guantanamo Bay is a personal priority for the President. It is something we have worked together on,’ said one senior Government source. ‘They understand the importance of this last case to Britain. We now expect them to look at those cleared for transfer and how to get on with that.’ Cori Crider of Reprieve, who is one of Mr Aamer’s lawyers, said: ‘These are prisoners who have never been charged with a crime or tried, and whom the US has long determined pose no threat to anyone.’","President Obama will give extra consideration to plight of Shaker Aamer .

"Rachel Ellis's twin daughters Lilly and Darcy were born at 37 weeks after surviving a rare condition which meant they shared a placenta in the womb . At 18 weeks pregnant, Rachel Ellis faced a terrifying decision. When doctors diagnosed her unborn twins with a rare condition they offered pioneering surgery to increase their chances of survival. The babies shared the same placenta, but an unequal blood supply meant one or both of the twins was unlikely to survive. The radical operation, which involved surgeons separating the girls using laser technology, gave the twins a 45 per cent chance of surviving to full term. Doctors inserted a camera and fibre optic laser down a tiny endoscope into Mrs Ellis's womb. The laser then sealed off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the girls received a more equal supply of blood. Just hours after the surgery, doctors feared the worst when at 19 weeks Mrs Ellis's waters broke. But remarkably the amniotic sacs re-sealed and the twins were born healthy at 37 weeks. The stay-at-home mother from Port Talbot in Wales, said she now treasures every moment with her twin daughters. The mother-of-four said: 'There was no doubt in my mind I wanted the surgery. 'I wanted to go through with it and give them both the best chance at life. 'I didn't care if they came out with mental or physical problems, I just wanted them alive. 'When they were born I was over the moon. They are just marvellous, I treasure every moment with them.' Mrs Ellis unexpectedly discovered she was pregnant at seven weeks. It was at an 18-week scan  at Singleton Hospital in Swansea that medics detected the abnormality. The condition is known as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, and results in one baby receiving an inadequate blood supply. Mrs Ellis, said: 'We were told that one of the babies was vacuumed in its sac. 'The consultant explained that one of the twins had about 12cm worth of fluid and the other baby just had 0.4cm, because of this she couldn't move her arms and legs at all. 'That's when he gave me a couple of options, he suggested that perhaps I should consider termination, or the laser surgery. 'I was so upset, I was just crying and all these emotions were just running through me.' Mrs Ellis was then referred to the Fetal Medicine Unit at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol and underwent surgery three days later. She was able to watch the whole procedure on a screen, due to the fact she was only under a local anesthetic. At an 18-week scan doctors diagnosed the condition twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. They told Mrs Ellis radical surgery to separate her unborn babies could give them a 45 per cent chance of surviving to full term . Mrs Ellis, pictured with the twins, her husband Stephen and their older children Crystal and Jay-Jay, said she immediately opted for the surgery. Doctors used a laser to seal off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the girls received a more equal supply of blood . Despite its success, the mother-of-four and her partner Stephen Ellis, 29, were left on tenterhooks after being warned that they were still not out of danger. Mrs Ellis was warned that she had a high chance of a miscarriage during the following six weeks. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a disease of the placenta. The condition only affects identical twins, who share a placenta. The condition causes the placenta to contain abnormal blood vessels, which connect to the umbilical cords and circulations of the twins. In many cases the common placenta is shared unequally by the twins, and one may have a share too small to provide the necessary nutrients to grow or even survive. She said: 'They said the first two weeks would be the worst. The doctors warned that it was likely one or both of the babies would be disabled or ill. 'When I came out of surgery I felt so relieved because they told me the surgery had gone much better than expected. I was so relieved. 'When I got home I could feel the babies kicking away so I was really happy.My belly had got so big - I suddenly looked like I was 30 weeks pregnant.' Just hours after returning home from the procedure her waters broke, despite being just 19 weeks pregnant. A test confirmed that the amniotic sacs had ruptured, but miraculously they were able to re-seal themselves. In spite of the scare the twins were born healthy on September 24, 2013 at Bridgend Hospital in Wales, with Lily weighing 5lbs and her sister, Darcy, weighed in at 5lbs 12oz. Mrs Ellis, who also has daughter Crystal, six, and son, Jay-Jay, three, said that after the traumatic start to life she values every minute with the girls. She said: 'Then my waters broke, I was only 19 weeks gone. My sac had ruptured. But  just hours after the pioneering operation, doctors feared the worst when Mrs Ellis's waters broke when she was just 19 weeks pregnant. But remarkably the amniotic sacs repaired themselves . Lilly and Darcy were born at 37 weeks. Their mother said: 'It was such a relief to finally get them both home. They are miracles, they are perfect' 'I was rushed to hospital where I was told that the babies were still alive. 'The following morning they did a scan and the doctors told me they weren't expecting to find a heartbeat. 'I didn't believe them though as I could still feel them kicking and I was adamant they would be ok. 'I had the scan and it was an absolute miracle - the sac had refilled and sealed itself. It was amazing. 'I was trying to keep my legs crossed, as then I was thinking that they just couldn't come out but after that the pregnancy was just smooth sailing. 'It was such a relief to finally get them both home. They are miracles, they are perfect.'","Rachel Ellis was told her unborn twins were suffering a rare condition .

"His Oscar nomination for best actor had been announced only a few hours before, but Eddie Redmayne was already a winner – in the eyes of the glamorous women surrounding him. From a gushing Angelina Jolie to a fawning Jessica Chastain, star of Interstellar, and a complimentary Emily Blunt, 31, the British actor was the only guest anyone wanted to talk to at a star-packed Hollywood event. An animated Miss Jolie, 39, was clearly unable to resist cooing over 33-year-old Redmayne as she applauded him for his performance as physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything, for which he won the Golden Globe for best actor on Sunday.

The pair last worked together in 2006 film The Good Shepherd and no doubt had plenty to catch up on. Redmayne found himself to be the centre of attention at the Critics’ Choice Awards in Los Angeles on Thursday evening. Although he was snubbed for best actor on this occasion – with Michael Keaton taking the award instead for Birdman – Redmayne still proved to be the hottest act in the room. Diane Kruger, 38, could not resist making a beeline for him, while fellow British star Rosamund Pike, 35, was more than delighted to share a joke with him having earned an Oscar nod herself for her turn in Gone Girl. Newlywed Redmayne was without his wife Hannah Bagshawe but spent most of his time with his The Theory Of Everything co-star Felicity Jones, 31. The British actress plays Hawking’s first wife Jane and is nominated for best actress at the Oscars, which will be held on February 22.

My manager was brandishing a phone and at the end of that phone someone was telling me I had been nominated. ‘I went from sleepy-eyed to pretty wide awake very fast. It was like going from nought to a hundred in a racing car. I have to say that I feel pretty damn good.’ Redmayne is no stranger to Hollywood having starred in My Week With Marilyn and the film adaptation of Les Miserables. But his lead role as Hawking has catapulted him into the super league and made him an instantly recognisable face and name.

"One of the two Maryland women charged with  murdering two toddlers in a gruesome 'exorcism' last year pleaded guilty, but will not serve any prison time. Under a plea agreement, Monifa Sanford, 22, pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and attempted first degree murder, but was not found criminally responsible, ABC 7 reports. Instead of prison time, Sanford will be committed to a psychiatric hospital for her role in the January 2014 murder of one-year-old Norell Harris and his two-year-old sister Zyana. Sanford and the children's mother, Zakieya Avery, 29, stabbed the toddlers with a serrated knife and choked the two young children in an attempted 'exorcism' because they believed the children were demon possessed.

Plea: Under a plea agreement, Monifa Sanford, 22,  will serve no time in prison for her role in the January 2014 'exorcism' murders of one-year-old Norell Harris and his sister Zyana, 2, but has been committed to a mental institution . Possessed: Sanford and the children's mother, Zakieya Avery, 29, attacked little Norell (left) and Zyana (right) because they believed the children were demon possessed . Avery's other two  children, then aged five and eight, were also stabbed and choked, but managed to survive. The testimony at Sanford's hearing Friday was so disturbing that the father of the two children erupted in the courtroom, forcing marshals to lead the man out of the room, WUSA reports. According to the testimony, Sanford's mental illness included hallucinations and voices, one of which she believed to be satan. 'Satan' allegedly told her that he was going to kill the children and 'if she wanted them to go to heaven, she had to do it herself,' according to the testimony.

David Felsen, a defense attorney, said that Sanford believed she had been initiated into a group of 'demon assassins' along with men, who an investigation revealed, were imaginary. The two women reportedly believed that they themselves had become possessed at some point and that the children were possessed and had evil spirits on them. They also believed that inanimate objects had been possessed, according to WUSA. Sanford has been committed to Clifton T. Perkins Mental Hospital and a trial for Avery is expected to take place later this year. After the women killed the young children and attacked Avery's older son and daughter on Jan. 17 of last year, they went for each other. WUSA reports that Avery stabbed and choked Sanford several times and the two eventually struggled over the knife. Avery grabbed the knife and continued to attack Sanford. At some point, the two stopped the attacks and showered. They washed the bodies of the two small children and one of the older children and laid them on a bed. Authorities responding to a report of suspicious activity, showed up at Avery's Germantown home at around 9.40am and discovered the gruesome scene. Norell and Zyana were pronounced dead on the scene. The two older children were treated at the scene then transferred to the hospital. Sanford was taken to a hospital as well. After the gruesome murders, Sandford reportedly told police 'I'm glad the children are in heaven, but I miss them.'

"A father who co-wrote a book with his son about how the boy visited heaven after a car wreck was telling the truth, his family has said - even though the youngster has now denied the tale. Alex Malarkey, now 16, was in a coma for two months and left paralyzed after the wreck in 2004, but when he awoke, he claimed an angel had lifted him up to heaven where he met Jesus and Satan. With his father, Kevin Malarkey, he wrote best-selling book 'The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven' in 2010 - but this week, Alex claimed the whole story was a lie. But Kevin's family said that is not the . 'Kevin has always told the truth,' his mother Joan told DailyMail.com on Friday. 'He told the truth and he did the right thing. He's not sure why Alex is saying these things now.' Scroll down for video . Truth or fiction? Alex Malarkey, left, co-wrote a book with his father Kevin, right, recounting how he saw heaven after being in a car crash. He has now denied the story - but Kevin's family said he has always told the truth . 'Lies': Alex Malarkey, pictured in 2009, was just six when he was in the crash and he remains paralyzed . Kevin Malarkey, who is recently divorced from Alex's mother Beth, has not publicly commented on Alex's claims, but Joan Malarkey said 'he has a lot of support' from relatives and friends. He published a second book last summer, 'A Beautiful Defeat'. The reaction comes after Alex claimed his story was nothing more than fiction. The book describes heaven thus: . 'When I arrived in heaven, I was inside the gate. The gate was really tall, and it was white. It was very shiny, and it looked like it had scales like a fish. I was in the inner heaven and everything was brighter and more intense on the inside of the gate. It was perfect. Perfect is my favorite word for describing heaven.' Alex also describes in the book how he floated above the scene of his crash and talked to Jesus while firefighters extricated his body from the wreckage. In an open letter addressed to 'Sellers, buyers and marketers' on Pulpit and Pen, Alex wrote: 'I did not die. I did not go to heaven.' 'I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,' he wrote. 'When I made the claims that I did, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to.' Adding that only the Bible describes what heaven is like, he said that people 'should read the Bible, which is enough. The Bible is the only source of truth. Anything written by man cannot be infallible.' Alex is still severely disabled and is cared for by his mother at home in Ohio. They live together in Huntsville with his three siblings. Kevin Malarkey lives in Columbus, Ohio. Beth Malarkey has said that Alex does not receive any money from the novel, which made the New York Times Bestsellers List in 2010. Long before Alex made his statement, Beth Malarkey had claimed on her blog that the book was made up and that when she approached the publishers, they did nothing. Controversial tale: Alex's mother Beth, left, says he does not receive any money from the sales of the book . Home life: Alex is able to stand with the help of a brace and has been taken on runs by his mother, right . 'There are many who are scamming and using the Word of God to do it,' she wrote last April. 'It is both puzzling and painful to watch the book The Boy who Came Back from Heaven to not only continue to sell, but to continue, for the most part, to not be questioned.' She even claimed that when Alex told a pastor that the book was made up, the man told him the publication was 'blessing' to people and to stay quiet. She added: 'The ones making money from the book are NOT the ones staying up through the night, struggling for their breath, or were they the ones at six years old, waking up unable to move or breathe and in a strange place after last remember seeing a car coming right at the car he was riding in'. Many Christian publishers are now announcing that they will stop selling the book. One of the book's stockists, The Lifeway Christian Bookstore, told Pulpit and Pen that it plans to remove the book from its shelves and send back its current stock. Before: Alex, pictured before the accident, was in a coma for two months after the crash when he was six . Full-time care: Alex's mother Beth, right, said none of the profits from the book have gone to Alex's care . In a statement, its director of communications, Martin King, said: 'LifeWay was informed this week that Alex Malarkey has retracted his testimony about visiting heaven as told in the book 'The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven.' Malarkey said he wrote the book because he thought it would get him 'attention'; it became a best seller . 'Therefore, we are returning to the publisher the few copies we have in our Stores.' The book is one of three 'real-life' tales of paradise on sale at Christian book stores - 90 Minutes in Heaven and Heaven is for Real are the others. The Malarkeys' book has been a popular read in Christian book stores and had a 4.3 rating on Amazon. It became part of a popular genre of books known as 'heavenly tourism'. Another young boy's tale of going to heaven, Colton Burpo from Nebraska has recently been made into the movie Heaven is For Real. The publishers description on the book reads: 'In 2004, Kevin Malarkey and his six-year-old son, Alex, suffered an horrific car accident. The impact from the crash paralyzed Alex–and medically speaking, it was unlikely that he could survive. 'I think Alex has gone to be with Jesus,' a friend told the stricken dad. 'But two months later, Alex awoke from a coma with an incredible story to share. Of events at the accident scene and in the hospital while he was unconscious. Of the angels that took him through the gates of heaven itself. Of the unearthly music that sounded just 'terrible' to a six-year-old. And, most amazing of all . . . Of meeting and talking to Jesus. 'The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven' is the true story of an ordinary boy's most extraordinary journey. As you see heaven and earth through Alex's eyes, you'll come away with new insights on miracles, life beyond this world, and the power of a father's love.'","Alex Malarkey said he visited heaven and met Jesus while in a coma for two months at age six following a car crash in 2004 .

"Barack Obama pointedly refused to call ISIS terrorists Muslims today as he spoke at a joint press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron. Standing just a few feet away, Cameron warned of a global 'Islamist extremist terrorist threat,' condemning the perversion of Islam in the strongest possible terms three times and using the word 'poisonous' to describe the radicalized ideology five times. Keeping with his administration's policy to label foreign fighters as 'terrorists,' Obama would not refer to the religion of ISIS militants during the White House news conference but at one point called them 'fanatics.' Obama said the world must 'lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the Muslim world' and push a counter narrative as 'aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming' from the radicals. Scroll down for video . U.S. President Barack Obama, right, and British Prime Minister David Cameron, left, hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, D.C. on Friday afternoon. Cameron repeatedly referred to radicalized Islam as a 'poisonous' ideology but Obama wouldn't imply religion was a motivating factor of terrorists . 'This phenomenon has violent roots, the ideology, the networks,' Obama said of ISIS. 'This has metastasized and it is widespread and it has penetrated communities around the world' Their Washington, D.C., news conference came after a working dinner on Thursday evening and a meeting in the Oval Office this morning. The U.S. President said in his opening remarks that the coalition against ISIS is 'systematically taking out their fighters,' and he looked forward to hosting Britain at terror summit in February. In his own statement Cameron told reporters, 'We face a poisonous and fanatical ideology that wants to pervert Islam.' 'We do face a very serious Islamist extremist terrorist threat in Europe, in America, across the world. And we have to be incredibly vigilant in terms of that threat,' he later said. Cameron said the world must focus on breaking down the 'poisonous radical death cult of a narrative' that's corrupting the Islamic religion. That is 'the heart of the matter' he said. It must also avoid creating 'safe havens for terrorists to otherwise talk to each other.' Obama said the U.S. and his allies were working to identify terrorist actors in Syria and deactivate them. 'This phenomenon has violent roots, the ideology, the networks,' he said. 'This has metastasized and it is widespread and it has penetrated communities around the world.' The U.S. President said he does not consider the threat from ISIS an 'existential' one, and like Cameron, he believe is one 'that we will solve.' 'We are stronger. We are representing values that the vast majority of Muslims believe in, in tolerance, and in working together to build rather than destroy, and so this is a problem that causes great heartache and tragedy and destruction,' he said. 'But it is one that ultimately we're going to defeat.' Obama said that weapons alone would do the job, and that he and Cameron discussed during their meeting how to 'lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the Muslim world so that this counter narrative against this nihilism is put out there as aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming out from these fanatics.' 'How do we make sure that we are working with local communities and faith leaders, and families' whether in Great Britain or the U.S., he said, 'so that we're inoculating ourselves against this kind of ideology. 'That's gonna be slow, plotting, systematic work,' Obama noted, but it's work he's 'confident' the U.S. can achieve it, 'especially with partners like the United Kingdom.' Obama also suggested that the U.S. had an 'advantage' over countries like Britain when it comes to fighting terrorism because 'our Muslim populations, they feel themselves to be Americans.' 'There is this incredible process of immigration and assimilation that is part of our tradition. That is probably our greatest strength,' he said. Cameron and Obama were just coming off of a meeting a working dinner on Thursday evening followed by an Oval Office meeting this morning . Obama said that during their meeting, he talked with Cameron about his views that the world must 'lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the Muslim world' and push a counter narrative as 'aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming' from the radicals . The White House has actively refused to describe Islamic radicals fighting in Iraq and Syria for a caliphate in religious terms. 'Let’s call them what they are,' Obama's spokesman said on Tuesday. 'These terrorists are individuals who would like to cloak themselves in the veil of a particular religion. 'But based on the fact that the religious leaders of that religion have roundly condemned their actions, those religious leaders have indicated that their actions are entirely inconsistent with Islam,' he said. Earnest said the fact that the 'majority of victims of terror attacks' are Muslim 'is a pretty clear indication that this is not a matter of the world being at war with Islam.' 'The world and the United States...is at war with these individuals, these violent extremists who carry out these acts of terror and try to justify it by invoking this religion.' he stated. The U.S. official admitted that unlike other Western leaders, including French President Francois Hollande, Obama's administration was purposefully avoiding use of the term 'radical Islam.' One reason, he said, is that, he 'wouldn’t want to be in a position where I’m repeating the justification that they have cited that I think is completely illegitimate.' 'These are individuals who are terrorists,''] he again said. 'And what they did was they tried to invoke their own distorted deviant view of Islam to try to justify them. 'And I think that is completely illegitimate. And what we should do is we should call it what it is. And it’s an act of terror, and it’s one that we roundly condemn.'","Five times British PM David Cameron referred to it a 'poisonous' ideology .

"Iain Duncan Smith’s wife has spoken for the first time about her battle with breast cancer. Betsy Duncan Smith, pictured, who has been married to the work and pensions secretary for 32 years, said: ‘My cancer was found very late. I didn’t pick up any of the signs. ‘Breast cancer took over my life for two years, the first bit was the worst. I couldn’t see a way out of it.’ After her diagnosis, the mother-of-four had to have six months of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Iain Duncan Smith's wife Betsy (pictured) has described how her breast cancer, which was found very late, took over her life . She added: ‘My energy levels went to zero. There were days I couldn’t walk. On occasion, I couldn’t even talk. Iain had to bring his office home and look after me. It must have been very worrying for him, poor chap, but he’s coped brilliantly.’ Mrs Duncan Smith, 55, who lost her hair during the treatment, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘That didn’t bother me in the slightest. It was the least of my problems. ‘Eventually I started getting stronger. I’m out of it now but I’m still checked.’ Speaking to the Daily Mail following his wife’s diagnosis, Mr Duncan Smith – who has been dubbed the quiet man of politics – said: ‘Betsy told me the doctor feared it was cancer. He was correct. It took my breath away. ‘I said, “Right, I’m coming home”. I went straight back to my office, picked up my bag and caught the train. I didn’t come back to Parliament for some time after that.’ Iain Duncan Smith (pictured with Betsy) said his wife's diagnosis had taken his breath away . His wife now supports cancer-detection dog charity Medical Detection Dogs. They can sniff out chemical changes in their owners and alert them. Mrs Duncan Smith – who lives near the charity’s Buckinghamshire headquarters – said: ‘A friend asked me to come along and see what the charity did. I was pretty reluctant. I had just had breast cancer, and had a rough time for two years with the treatment. ‘So the last thing I wanted at that point was to get involved with anything concerning cancer. But when I was finally persuaded to visit, I was quite simply blown away.’ She said she has now adopted one of the charity’s cocker spaniels.","Iain Duncan Smith's wife Betsy said her breast cancer was found late .

"Women in their 50s are having fertility treatment paid for by the NHS. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said up to 12 such women were granted IVF funding over a three-year period. Campaigners said that public money should instead go on telling women how hard it was to get pregnant in their 50s. Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: ‘We’d be better spending money educating women about the reality of reproduction. Fertility starts to dip mid-thirties and by 50 it’s at the menopausal stage. Campaigners have said that public money should not be spent on funding IVF for women over 50 but should instead go on telling women how hard it was to get pregnant at that age (picture posed by models) ‘No matter how hard we try to keep eternally young we know that ageing takes place and it impacts significantly on reproduction at a much earlier stage than most women realise. ‘Whether it’s on the NHS or privately, doctors must be very honest with women and not raise false hopes. There was probably lots of heartache, it is highly unlikely a woman will get pregnant after 50.’ Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘While we can sympathise with those women who have reached the end of their natural childbearing years without having the children they longed for, the use of medical technology to overcome the natural order raises serious ethical questions. ‘The NHS should recognise that there are good reasons why the years of female fertility are limited and not fund treatment that seeks to artificially prolong them. ‘All too often, children are being regarded as consumer goods to be fitted in when they are most convenient to the lifestyle choices of their mothers, rather than as human beings to be loved and treasured in their own right.’ Under NHS guidelines, women can be offered IVF only up to the age of 42 and in many areas it is heavily rationed. Only one in five local clinical commissioning groups offers the recommended three courses of treatment. Many offer only one or refuse to fund it once women turn 35. Experts said it was probable women undergoing IVF in their 50s would use younger, donor eggs as their own would be of too poor quality to be fertilised. This adds £6,000 to the £3,000 standard treatment cost. The fertilisation authority would not say exactly how many women in their 50s had their doctor’s consent for IVF but admitted it was two to four each year in 2010, 2011 and 2012. This means that up to 12 women in their 50s over that period were given IVF treatment. Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics said it was highly unlikely a woman will get pregnant after 50 while experts warned that even successful pregnancies carried higher risks at that age . Philippa Taylor, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, which represents 4,000 Christian doctors, said: ‘This raises the issue about success rates, which are less than 1.9 per cent, the NHS’s funding and the effect on the woman’s health and her baby. The risks to the mother are increased the older she gets. ‘IVF is not the panacea it’s often made out to be. I have sympathy for any woman desperate to have a child – but they should not delay childhood and assume IVF is an insurance policy that can be taken out at any age.’ The authority’s figures also show that soaring numbers of women in their 40s and 50s are opting for IVF. Totals for NHS and private sector treatment show that around 170 women a week in their 40s had IVF in 2012. The annual total was 8,808 – nearly 1,300 higher than in 2008. The number of women in their 40s paying for private IVF treatment went up by 25 per cent between 2008 and 2012. Studies have suggested that women who conceive in their 50s are at a far higher risk of suffering from high blood pressure and potentially dangerous blood clots. Children born to much older mothers are also more likely to be born prematurely or to have Down’s syndrome. The risk of stillbirth is also higher. A poll of 2,000 people last year showed that almost three quarters do not believe older women should be given IVF to help them conceive. It also found that one in three thought the suggested limit of 42 for IVF on the NHS was too high. And two in three said children born to women aged between 50 and 55 were negatively affected by having an older mother. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘IVF treatment is a clinical decision, taking consideration of NICE guidelines.’","Up to a dozen women in their 50s received NHS funded IVF in three years .

"A young mother has been arrested after her newborn son died with traces of methamphetamine in his blood stream. Tyelyn Sanders of Calhoun County, Alabama was picked up after an autopsy showed that her four-month-old son, who died in August 2014, had meth in his bloodstream - this after Sanders said she breastfed the boy, making it likely that she was using the drug around the time she was feeding her child. What's more, when Sanders' two other children, ages 8 and 2, were tested for the drug, they both turned up positive. Tyelyn Sanders (above) of Calhoun County, Alabama was picked up after an autopsy showed that her four-month-old son, who died in August 2014, had meth in his bloodstream .

"A section of guardrail has fallen from the 81st floor of New York's tallest residential building - prompting local officials to bring construction work to a halt. The 8ft piece of metal plummeted from a hoist during work on the luxury 1,396ft (426m) 432 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday. It landed in front of the main entrance of a building across 56th Street, the department but nobody was injured. The city's Department of Buildings put a 'stop work' order in place on the 96-storey condo that is set to become the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere when it is completed. Dangerous: A section of guardrail has fallen from the 81st floor of New York's tallest residential building, 432 Park Avenue, prompting local officials to stop construction work . Close: The piece fell from the luxury residential building - which boats some of the best views of downtown Manhattan and beyond - and landed in front of an adjacent building. Officials said no one was injured . However it has now been rescinded after the machinery involved was investigated. It is not the first time however that someone working on the site has been in danger. In March 2013, a construction worker was injured at 432 Park Avenue when a pallet of wood fell on his leg. The dangerous accident also recalls One57’s crane collapse during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 which forced residents nearby to evacuate for a week. Designed by architect Rafael Viñoly, the  condo, which is due to be finished this year, offers 104 units, ranging in price from $16.95million to a whopping $95million penthouse suite. Astonishingly, it towers over the Empire State Building (1,250ft), the Chrysler Building (1,046ft) and One World Trade Center without its spire (1,368ft).

And the rest of the building is just as impressive - with climate-controlled wine cellars, an outdoor terrace, a spa, a 'massage therapy room' and a pool. In the luxury accommodation residents can also frequent a billiards room, dine in a restaurant underneath a crystal chandelier, socialise in a lounge and keep fit in a private gym. The building, which sits between 56th and 57th Streets, first underwent excavation work on September 26, 2011, followed by three years of construction.","Piece fell from a hoist at 432 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan .

"Arriving at a reception for foster carers in Islington this morning, the Duchess of Cambridge was resplendent in a brown silk shirt-dress. But while the frock might have looked a million dollars, its real price tag was a snip: £169 in the run-up to Christmas but now selling for just £50. It came from what is fast becoming the Duchess' go-to label for everything from glamorous evening receptions to hot weather international tours - Hobbs. Scroll down for video . Favourite label: The Duchess of Cambridge wore a discount £50 Hobbs shirt-dress for a visit to Islington . Not the first time: The British label, which is entirely designed in London, is a favourite . Once a die-hard fan of Zara, of late the Duchess has swapped the low-cost high street store for the more upmarket Hobbs, which sits alongside another budget favourite, L.K Bennett, in her wardrobe. 'The Duchess of Cambridge likes to play it quite safe when it comes to her wardrobe, pre and post baby and Hobbs is the perfect brand for her,' explains fashion pundit Simon Glazin. 'Not only is it uber British, with everything designed in-house in London, it also dovetails with royal fashion protocol: not too revealing, neutral colours, and affordable.' As well as today's outing, the Duchess wore a delicate polka dot velvet top by the brand for a Place2Be reception at Kensington Palace in November. On that occasion, she deployed one of her favourite styling tricks and combined the budget top with a glamorous silk skirt by Jenny Packham for maximum sartorial effect. Looking good: The Duchess last stepped out in Hobbs at a Place2Be event in November . Glamorous: She styled the Hobbs top with an elegant silk skirt by designer name, Jenny Packham . Elegant: Earlier the same month, the Duchess wore a black dress by the brand during a visit to Wales . She had repeated the trick two months earlier when Kate, then just recovered from a bout of severe morning sickness, opted for a black dress by the label for a visit to the Valero Refinery in Pembrokeshire. Partly hidden by her baby blue Matthew Williamson coat, it was yet another example of her ability to transform a high street frock into an upscale ensemble by mixing and matching her pieces. But although Wales, Kensington and Islington are the most recent outings, they are by no means the only ones for the Duchess' Hobbs wardrobe. Most eye-catching was the recycled Hobbs dress, last seen in the run-up to London 2012, for a trip to Uluru with the result she looked both cool and practical in the baking desert heat. The Wessex dress, which was worn by the Duchess to play ping pong at a London sports club, was a bargain when she bought it and had been discounted to a cut-price £35 in the brand's sale. But the grey and white Wessex dress isn't the only Hobbs number to have been worn several times by the Duchess. One of Kate's cupboard staples is a £369 brown wool coat, bought at a cut-price £182, which made its debut during a visit to Liverpool on Valentine's Day 2012. Chic: The Duchess wore her faithful grey and white Wessex dress for a visit to Uluru while in Australia . Cool: She looked cool and polished in the belted dress, despite the Australian desert heat . First outing: The £35 dress was first worn to a London sports club in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics . Faithful friend: This £369 chestnut brown coat made its first appearance in Liverpool in 2012 . Stylish: The coat was bought for a cut-price £182 and was styled with a black jumper on its first outing . Worn over a cosy black polo neck, the Duchess accessorised the piece with her favourite black opaque tights and court shoes combination, a trick that she repeated today in Islington. A year later and Kate, by then pregnant with Prince George, was back in the same coat once more, this time for a trip to Grimsby. Although six months pregnant, she had no problems stretching the coat over her bump and even managed to fasten the belt. Hobbs also proved the label of choice for Kate's final public engagement ahead of Prince George's birth, with the 33-year-old opting for an eye-catching - and roomy - dalmatian-print coat. The £169 coat was worn to launch cruise ship Royal Princess in Southampton and, like everything else she wears, promptly sold out. 'Hobbs and the Duchess of Cambridge are a match made in heaven,' adds fashion expert Stephanie Hirschmiller. 'The label beloved by the Home Counties crew is a safe bet for the royal bump, a real go-to for classics and fashion without the inverted commas.' Seeing double: The coat reappeared a year later when the Duchess made a trip to Grimsby . Belting up: Despite being six-months pregnant with Prince George, the Duchess was able to belt the coat . Show-stopper: The Duchess also chose Hobbs for her final appearance before having Prince George . Sold out: The £169 coat worn by the eight-months pregnant Kate sold out straightaway .","The Duchess of Cambridge regularly steps out wearing Hobbs .

"Sipping beer in a quaint brasserie, frolicking under the Eiffel Tower and taking a sneaky peek at a painting of a naked woman, this is 1950's Paris as seen through the lens of photographer Robert Doisneau. Part of a new book celebrating the legendary photographer's work, the photos offer a glimpse of a world where the ladies were glamorous and the cigarettes plentiful and nearly always Gauloise. Doisneau, who died in 1994, made his name in the 1930's and specialised in roaming the streets of the French capital, Leica camera in hand, to capture intimate tableaux featuring the city's residents. Scroll down for video . Famous: Doisneau's most famous photograph is 'Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville' (the kiss outside City Hall) which was taken in 1950 . Striking: This photograph, taken in the 1950s, shows customers, including a newly married couple, enjoying a drink in a brasserie . Most famous of all his works is 'Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville' [the kiss outside City Hall], which shows a passionate couple puckering up in the middle of a milling crowd, and is among the 400 photos in the new tome titled, simply, Robert Doisneau. Like his contemporary Henri Cartier-Bresson, much of Doisneau's work focused on the ordinary and the mundane, although many of his photographs focus on Paris' street children at play. Their seemingly happy childhoods were a world away from his own, which came to an abrupt end at the age of four when his plumber father was killed on active duty during World War I. Brought up by his widowed mother until the age of seven, he then suffered a further tragedy when she died - leaving him to be brought up by an aunt variously described as 'unloving' and 'cold'. Favourite: Doisneau was particularly well known for his playful photographs of children, among them this shot taken beneath the Eiffel Tower . Working girl: This beautifully composed shot taken in 1947 shows a woman enjoying the sunshine with a typewriter balanced on her knees . Despite his struggles at home, Doisneau proved an adept student, in particular in art and craft, and when he graduated in 1929, got a job as a draughtsman in an advertising agency. The agency, Atelier Ullmann, also had a photography studio and Doisneau, who first got his hands on a camera aged 16, was eventually able to switch jobs and become an assistant photographer. After a stint working as an assistant to modernist photographer André Vigneau, Doisneau struck out on his own, selling his first photograph to Excelsior magazine in 1932. Work as an industrial photographer for Renault followed, as did a brief period photographing for postcards. In 1939 came Doisneau's big break - a contract with photographic agency Rapho. When war broke out months later, he was drafted into the French army as both soldier and photographer and spent much of the following year taking pictures of soldiers. Sneak peek: This knowing shot shows a gendarme (policeman) taking a sneaky look at a painting of a naked woman . Back for another look! The gendarme wasn't the only man to be caught enjoying a quick look at the naked lady by Doisneau . And again! This gentleman, wearing a neat black Homburg hat, appears pleased to catch a glimpse of the painting . Ordinary: Much of Doisneau's work focused on ordinary people going about their lives, such as this pair of women . Following the fall of France, he joined the French Resistance, using his draughtmanship and photography skills to create false passports for agents and those who needed to escape. Despite his wartime heroics, Doisneau is most famous for his post-war career, in particular his 1950's street scenes which focused on ordinary people going about their daily lives. Doisneau, who lived in the southern Paris suburb of Gentilly for most of his life, never stopped taking photos, although the rise of television in the 1970's left him with fewer magazine clients and forced a move into celebrity portraits. Nevertheless, despite the huge stars who sat for him in his studio, Doisneau, who died aged 81 in 1994, never lost his passion for the Paris streets where his life as a photographer began. Tough lesson: Doisneau caught this young child looking pained as he attempts to work out his sums in a class . Stern: A woman looks out from the doorway of her home, peering sternly at Doisneau's camera . Risque: Another knowing photograph, this shows a man relaxing with a cigarette and a wall-full of pornographic photos .","A new book of photographs showcasing the work of Robert Doisneau has been released .

"A 36-year-old woman convicted of a hate crime hoax in Nebraska hasn't shown up for jail time that she was required to serve because she didn't meet the conditions of her probation. Charlie Rogers is a former University of Nebraska-Lincoln basketball player who was convicted of lying to police about being attacked by three masked men who carved anti-gay slurs into her skin. She has said she's a lesbian. A prosecutor told the Lincoln Journal Star Thursday that Rogers' probation officer didn't sign a document that would have waived the 90-day jail term ordered at her April 2013 sentencing. No show: Charlie Rogers (center) didn’t show up for her 90-day jail sentence Thursday after failing to complete all the terms of her probation. She is seen here leaving court in 2013 . False report: Rogers, who was a star basket player at the University of Nebraska, told police three masked men broke into her Lincoln house on July 22 and attacked her, leaving her face and body bruised (right) Rogers was immediately required to serve seven days in jail, which she fulfilled. The terms of her probation included 250 hours of community service and a requirement to get a full-time job. Chief Deputy County Attorney Pat Condon said Rogers didn't show up as required at 8 a.m. Thursday at Lancaster County Jail because her probation documents had been finished. A jailer said Rogers still wasn't in custody there on Friday. Rogers' lawyer didn't immediately return a call from The Associated Press. The county's chief deputy probation officer has declined to talk about Rogers and her probation problems. Prosecutors say Rogers reported in July 12, 2012, that the men who attacked her tried to set fire to her home before leaving. Failed: Rogers, once a star basketball player (picutred), had done less than 10 percent of the 250 community service hours she needed to finish during her probation at the end of 2013, court records show . A neighbor told police that Rogers crawled from her home naked, bleeding and screaming for help. Rogers' story quickly fell apart, and prosecutors said she faked the attack because she thought it would inspire change in the treatment of gay people. Prosecutors said Rogers purchased zip ties, a box cutter and white gloves shortly before the attack, and that the evidence didn't support what she said had happened. Judge Gale Pokorny read a message on her Facebook page shortly before the alleged attack, in which she wrote, 'So maybe I am too idealistic, but I believe way deep inside me that we can make things better for everyone. I will be a catalyst. I will do what it takes. I will. Watch me.' Scene: A neighbor told police that on the night of the alleged attack, Rogers crawled from her home naked, bleeding and screaming for help . Rogers has maintained her innocence. The reported attack provoked outrage and spread fear among Lincoln's gay community, and hundreds of people turned out for a rally outside the state Capitol. At the time, Lincoln was debating whether to adopt a proposed 'fairness ordinance' that would have banned discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation, and tensions were high among those on both sides of the issue.","Charlie Rogers, 36, didn’t show up for her 90-day jail sentence Thursday .

"A stone-faced Rosie Perez was seen leaving her Brooklyn brownstone this morning, a day after it was revealed that the actress will not return to The View after her hiatus to rehearse for a Broadway show. 'The executives had to make a serious change to The View and breath new life into the show, so Perez was the 'to go"",' a network insider told Daily Mail Online exclusively. Perez has not commented since the news broke. The actress, 50, had also became difficult to work with, having gone through six makeup artists, two assistants, and several hair stylists before deciding to do her own hair most days, insiders said. Perez also struggled with the variety of subjects the show did for Hot Topics and never got the hang of using the teleprompter. Scroll down for video . Fired: Rosie Perez was stone-faced as she left her Brooklyn, New York home on Friday morning. After Variety revealed she was leaving the show, Daily Mail Online reported exclusively that she was let go by ABC . Over: Rosie Perez, leaving her Brooklyn home this morning, is the first casualty of The View's plunging ratings . More to come?: Insiders say Rosie Perez may be followed by others as ABC fights to save The View . The staff of The View were in shock when they heard that Rosie Perez has been booted from the show. And no one more so than Rosie O'Donnell, who doesn't believe it. She went on a tirade denying the news Variety broke on Wednesday evening that Perez would not be returning to the show after her hiatus to rehearse for a Broadway show is over. 'No matter what you read anywhere, Rosie Perez is also coming back after she is done rehearsing her play…regardless of what you hear in other shows or read in magazines as I did last night at 11:40. 'What the BLEEP,' Rosie said as she was cut off from uttering was was sure to be the f-word. But sources confirm to Daily Mail Online that Perez is a goner. 'Everyone is in a panic here and something had to be done,' a network insider told Daily Mail Online. 'The executive producer had to make a serious change to breath new life into the show. Perez was the ""to go"".' The news came just days after Daily Mail Online exclusively reported that the long-running talk show could end after this season, amid struggling ratings and infighting among the talk show hosts. a show spokesperson has denied such a possibility. Rosie O had a major melt down behind the scenes over the report that the show may be canceled. Prima donna: The actress, 50, had also became difficult to work with, having gone through six makeup artists, two assistants, and several hair stylists before deciding to do her own hair most days . Tight-lipped: Rosie hasn't talked since it was revealed that's she's out at the show . Bye Bye Rose P:  Rosie Perez wasn't cutting it on The View. She even tangled with pal Rosie O'Donnell. Now she's been cut from the show . Saving the day: ABC execs have brought back the show's creator Barbara Walters to guest co-host on Fridays for the month of January to bring some 'familiarity back to the show' And even more bad news for the belaguered show today as Deadline Hollywood revealed that TheTalk with Sara Gilbert beat out The View in total viewers for the first time for the week ending January 11. 'a small but psychologically significant 2% jump over the 2.88 million The View pulled over the same period.' Currently in its eighteenth season, The View, created by retired TV journalist Barbara Walters is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez. Now under the umbrella of ABC News, the network is considering the possibility of ending the show and replacing it with an extended version of 'Good Morning America.' The View has a history of denying reports that hosts were leaving the show - only to be proven wrong. A year ago, Barbara Walters denied that Elisabeth Hasselbeck was leaving. She did. Jenny McCarthy insisted she wasn't leaving the show. She did. Since the rating-challenged daytime talk show returned from its winter hiatus on January 5, host O'Donnell – who has been moderating while Whoopi Goldberg has been nursing a back injury – has reminded the audience that Perez was out for the entire month of January rehearsing for the Broadway play Fish in the Dark with Larry David. The show has used several guest co-hosts, including The View favorite, comedian Mario Cantone, to fill in for Perez. They even brought back the show's creator Barbara Walters to guest co-host on Fridays for the month of January to bring some 'familiarity back to the show', as an insider explained to Daily Mail Online. But ABC News has been pressuring the show's executive producer to make some changes to the show, with its lackluster ratings. The show's direct competition, The Talk, is narrowing in on the gap and is close to overtaking it; and freshman talker The Real continues to crush the show in the key demographic age of 18 to 34-year-olds. The 50-year-old Perez was a last minute addition to The View lineup. As first reported last July by Daily Mail Online, new co-host Nicolle Wallace and former reality show October Gonzalez had landed the spots once occupied by Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy. Favorite: The show has used several guest co-hosts, including The View favorite, comedian Mario Cantone, to fill in for Rosie Perez during her rehearsals for her stint on Broadway. Mario was also a Sex and the City fave . 'But once the producers started doing test shows and chemistry tests, they realized October just wasn't going to cut it. Good looks and girl-next-door charm alone wasn't going to carry her at the Hot Topics table,' explained the insider. Perez confessed during an appearance on the Wendy Williams Show last fall, that she was a last minute addition to the show. 'They approached me two weeks before and I only had a day to decide,' she told Williams. The actress and former choreographer was friends with O'Donnell prior to working together on the show, but the two fell out after a debate about Bill Cosby's rape allegations caused tension with them behind the scenes. Perez had a major melt down after a hostile, gum-chewing O'Donnell treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby. Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true. Perez attempted to defend her opinion to O'Donnell but O'Donnell wasn't having it. Sweet substitutes: ABC is interested in wooing younger co-hosts to fill Perez's seat as well as the fifth seat never filled.  Glee star Naya Rivera, 28 and  Destiny's Child singer Michelle Williams, 34, are being considered . ABC is very interested in wooing younger co-hosts to fill Perez's seat and the fifth seat that was never filled in its attempt to save the show. The front runner now is former Destiny's Child singer Michelle Williams, 34, who came in for a single guest hosting position on January 7 and was so impressive executives brought her back for an unplanned follow-up appearance days later. 'She's smart, witty, has A-List celebrity relationships that can benefit the show and isn't afraid to sell a segment. She let O'Donnell pop a pimple on her chin on live TV during her first appearance,' said the insider. ABC News is also still interested in Glee star Naya Rivera, 28. Of the guest hosts, the actress has been invited back the most to fill-in and she doesn't mind a good argument on a topic. 'She confessed that she only showers once every three days and social media went crazy. That's the type of person they think will help the show pop again,' said the source. There will be additional younger co-hosts in throughout the month of January and ABC News is also trying to get some former co-hosts to come back and fill-in to bring back some of the audience. Overall ratings are down 34 percent, according to sources,  and they hope to gain viewers back. Joy Behar was supposed to guest host on Monday and Tuesday of this week, but came down with the flu and Cantone sat in her in place.","Rosie Perez, who has been on hiatus while rehearsing for a Broadway show, has been fired from The View .

"'Visit Barnsley', which has almost 3,000 followers, describes the former mining town as a 'godless den of filth' in a parody of the original council-run account . A spoof twitter account has come under fire for mocking a Yorkshire town - branding it the 'pound shop capital of the north' and the 'birthplace of dogging'. 'Visit Barnsley', which has almost 3,000 followers, describes the former mining town as a 'godless den of filth' in a parody of the original council-run account. Using the hashtag #BarnsleyIsBrill, the account highlights the town's amenities such as botched tanning salons and a market which sells cheap knock-off goods. One photograph shows a woman smothered in fake tan with the caption: 'Planning an expensive holiday this year? Why not save a fortune and visit Barnsley suntan guaranteed #barnsleyisbrill.' Another post shows a rundown street with a row of derelict shops and flats, with the message: 'Want US to promote your business? Just drop us line. Look how we've helped businesses in other areas.' The founder of the account, who lives in nearby Wakefield and wished to remain anonymous, said he set it up because many people think of Barnsley as being a 'rough' town in the 'grim north'. 'I'm from Wakefield but I'm in Barnsley every other weekend, I've nothing against Barnsley let's get that out of the way,' he said. 'As to why I set it up. Most people think of Barnsley as being a bit rough, an ex-mining town up in the grim north. So give them what they want to hear.' 'I do have quite a few more considerably bigger accounts too.' In the bio for the spoof account, the description says: 'Visit Barnsley, Pound Shop Capital Of The North, You Won't Be Not Disappointed. Why Not Let Us Promote Your Business?'

Councillor Betty Barlow said: 'It's a very busy prosperous town. I don't know why they would say those things about the town, it does not paint the town in a good light. 'It is a great tourism destination. There are a lot of open air spaces, lots of museums, lovely attractions, such as Cannon Hall.

"Sprouts have certainly earned themselves a bad rep, falling out of favour with kids and grownups alike. The miniature vegetables have long been a staple on British dinner plates and also the subject of many a heated debate for their 'love them or hate them' qualities. But despite their reluctant popularity on home shores they have never been a best-seller in America - until now. UK growers have developed the kalette, a cross breed of sprouts and the popular superfood kale . However, in a bid to get the cabbage-like vegetable back on the menu, cunning British growers have found a way to make it appeal to the trendy foodie. British experts have spent 15 years working tirelessly to perfect a tastier and more appealing version of the classic Brussels sprout by cross-breeding it with kale. The leafy green superfood has become extremely trendy in recent years enjoyed by A-listers such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Miranda Kerr. Growers first began developing the idea in 1995 but didn't begin selling the veg in the UK until 2010 . An 85g serving of Kallettes provides: . Souce: Ocean Mist . The new creations, called kalettes, taste milder and sweeter than Brussels sprouts but growers had a battle on their hands to make US buyers see past the vegetable's stuffy, old-fashioned image. They are the brainchild of independent Surrey growers Tozer Seeds, who began working on developing better-tasting Brussels in 1995. As well as tasting better than the average Brussels sprout, kalettes are also extremely hardy and produce heavy crops even through the coldest of winters. Unlike Brussels sprouts, which are typically boiled, kalettes can be steamed, roasted, stir-fried, grilled, microwaved or even raw. They hit the shelves in the UK in 2010 under the name 'flower sprouts' but have only just been launched in the US. Since hitting the American market in October the new creations have been flying off the shelves. They have proved such a hit that growers have had to step up production to try to meet the demand. Kalettes have since appeared in magazines such as Time and Elle, in papers like the New York Times and on national news programmes such as Fox News. Kalettes are a crossed between sprouts and kale and promise a sweeter-tasting vegetable . David Rogers, from Tozer Seeds, says that despite their recent popularity kalettes have been around for almost 20 years. 'Kalettes came about initially from experiments we carried out in 1995 to create new vegetables by cross breeding them. 'We found that the results of breeding Brussels sprouts and kale were particularly good, with a great taste and a great look - milder in flavour than a Brussels sprout with more attractive leaves.' Kalettes hit the US market back in October and have become so popular that growers have had to up their production in order to keep on top of the demand . David said that although the initial idea was developed it took years of work before they perfected the vegetable. Both Brussels sprouts and kale belong to the Brassica family of vegetables which also includes broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, horseradish, turnip, radish and cress. Brassica vegetables are renowned for their ability to be cross-bred with one another, which occurs because they are all derivatives of a wild cabbage that existed 5,000 years ago. The Latin name for the Brussels sprout is Brassica oleracea gemmifera while kale is Brassica oleracea acephala. 'But in growing it takes years and years to refine the product and get to a point where they can be mass produced and sold,' he said. 'We started talking to growers and supermarkets in 2005 and the feedback was positive but it takes a lot to launch a new vegetable that no-one's ever heard of before.' After 15 years in the making the developers of the vegetable were thrilled when the product was met with huge success after being launched in the UK. 'Our creation finally hit the shelves in the UK in 2010 under the name ""flower sprouts"" and was a real hit. 'British people tend to view Brussels sprouts are seen as a very old fashioned vegetable that are typically boiled. They're a real Marmite vegetable - certain people love them but a lot of people don't. 'We certainly felt flower sprouts would be more appealing to the modern customer.' When launching the vegetable overseas the marketers sought out a name to appeal to foodies. 'Historically Brussels sprouts have been popular in western European countries but not a big seller in America. 'Our marketing agency in the States cleverly ditched the name 'sprouts' and rebranded them 'kalettes' to capitalise on the popularity of kale as a superfood.' Since the kalettes arrived in America the growers have been overwhelmed with their popularity. 'We only launched kalettes in October but they have been flying off the shelves across the US. Everyone's going crazy for them. 'More by luck than judgement, here we are 20 years on with a hit product made from kale, the trendiest vegetable on the market today. 'We never thought that when we began our experiments all those years ago we would have found success across the pond with the humble sprout.'","Growers wanted to give sprouts a modern makeover for the US market .

"Swiss tourism bosses fear a huge drop in holiday-makers visiting the country, after a shock economic move sent prices rocketing. The Swiss franc rose nearly 30 per cent against the euro after the Swiss National Bank's announcement that it would remove a three-year-old cap of 1.20 francs per euro. Ski resorts are expected to be hit particularly hard over the winter period, with some businesses already reporting cancellations as visitors rushed to rearrange their plans for the busy winter season. Swiss tourism bosses fear a huge drop in holiday-makers visiting the country, after a shock economic move sent prices rocketing . The price of a six-day ski pass in Verbier, a resort popular with Europeans, rose to 347 euros on Thursday, up from 296 euros before the franc's surge. A cordon bleu schnitzel in Zurich's Zeughauskeller, a popular tourist resort, costs an extra 4 euros at 27.9 euros and a beer is now 6.3 euros. Officials now say that a country already struggling with a reputation for being expensive will find it harder to attract visitors. Tourists from Europe accounted for 37 percent of overnight stays in 2013, according to latest data from the Swiss statistics office, but the country will be out of reach for many after 'SNB Day'. The franc's abrupt surge comes weeks before European school half-term breaks which mark the height of the ski season. The Swiss franc rose nearly 30 percent against the euro after the Swiss National Bank's announcement that it would remove a three-year-old cap of 1.20 francs per euro . Swiss hoteliers vented their fury on social media and politicians urged the Swiss to support the country's tourism industry, while resorts across the French border cheered a 'Godsend' as they looked forward to new Swiss clients. ‘Swiss people! Take your holidays in Switzerland!’ said Swiss tourist office chief Juerg Schmid on a twitter account. In Gstaad, hotelier Thomas Frei tweeted: ‘Great, first rejections, wanting to know the euro rate and whether we can do a better rate. While I'm at it, does anyone want to buy my hotel?’ Tourism contributes three percent of Swiss GDP and hotels and restaurants employ five percent of the labour force. The franc's abrupt surge comes weeks before European school half-term breaks which mark the height of the ski season . ‘The original forecasts predicting growth once again in the Swiss tourism industry over the next two years probably won't stand up any more,’ Christoph Juen, CEO of the Swiss hotel association hotelleriesuisse, told Reuters. That is an ‘existential threat’ to some hoteliers, he said. ‘I'm glad I'm just here for one day,’ said Amit Raj, 29 from Seville in Spain. ‘I'm definitely going to be a lot more cautious tonight and won't withdraw any more money,’ he added. Even before the decision to allow the Franc to surge, Europe's economic woes had seen the number of German travellers to Switzerland drop 19 percent over five years to 1.9 million by 2013, according to the latest available German tourism association data. In Alpine ski resorts, the economic chill has worsened in the past year as the number of Russian visitors fell sharply due to Moscow's standoff with the West over Ukraine and because of a weaker Russian rouble. Tourism from Japan has also been hit as the yen weakened. The news comes after it was revealed that British holidaymakers are looking to alternative ski destinations after the Alps experienced one of the worst starts to a season in living memory. Until a blizzard hit in late December France's top skiing destinations were mostly void of snow . An even bigger test for the mainly small businesses in the hotel and restaurant industry could come during the summer. In the busiest summer months 2.5 million nights per month are booked by foreigners at Swiss hotels, 70 percent more than during the peak ski season, says Eurostat. Over in France, Clement Marie, co-manager of the Savoyarde Hotel in Val d'Isere, a ski resort less than three hours by car from Geneva, saw the franc's appreciation as a chance to attract Swiss customers. ‘This could be great for business,’ he said. ‘Considering how little snow and how few customers we have had this January, this could be a Godsend.’ The news comes after it was revealed that British holidaymakers are looking to alternative ski destinations after the Alps experienced one of the worst starts to a season in living memory. A study has shown that online searches for destinations in Norway have soared while queries for traditional getaways in France have plummeted by more than half, according to travel website Kayak. The sudden interest in Norwegian resorts reflects the perfect conditions at the country’s ski runs. A study by Kayak suggests that interest in Norwegian ski resorts has soared after the Alps' slow start . Kayak said searches for flights going to Kristiansund Airport have doubled over last year, while searches for Chambery Airport in the French Alps have decreased by 56 per cent. Until a blizzard hit in late December – stranding thousands of holidaymakers – France's top skiing destinations were mostly void of snow and openings were delayed at resorts where slopes were bare. It came after a spell of unseasonably warm weather that was responsible for one of the ‘least snowy’ winters in the French Alps in 35 years. Kayak said Denver, Calgary, Helsinki and Vancouver airports – all located near popular skiing destinations – have also seen a surge of interest. In comparison searches to all five of the Alps’ main airports, including Chambery, are down, according to the travel website. The others are Friedrichshagen, Germany (down 37 per cent), Grenoble (down 26 per cent), Lyon (down 14 per cent) and Geneva (down four per cent). Loella Pehrsson, regional managing director for Kayak, said: ‘It’s clear that the lack of snow in the Alps has had a big impact on searches to airports around the region with Brits looking elsewhere in search of snow.’ The study was based on flight searches between 1 December and 7 January for travel between the dates of 12 January and 1 April.","The Swiss National Bank ended a cap of 1.20 francs per euro on Thursday .

"This woman could have paid the equivalent of £3.33 a a chicken at Tesco and Asda. The stores are running promotions where three of their £4 chickens can be bought for £10 . We've already seen battles over milk prices – now supermarkets are slashing the cost of chickens in their fierce fight to win customers. Waitrose has halved the price of its 1.3kg ‘Essentials’ chicken from £4.23 to just £2.11 in the last few days – making it even cheaper than budget brands Aldi and Lidl, who are selling 1.25kg birds for £2.99. Tesco and Asda are running promotions where three of their £4 chickens (weighing 1.35kg each) can be bought for £10 – the equivalent of £3.33 a bird. Sainsbury’s has permanently cut the cost of its 1.35kg chicken by £1 – from £4.50 to £3.50. And Marks & Spencer is offering its 1.1kg Oakham chicken, which is normally £4, at two for £7. Shoppers will undoubtedly welcome the discounts – but critics are warning that poultry welfare could suffer as a result, and some farmers may be forced out of business. They are already being squeezed on milk prices as supermarkets compete to offer the cheapest deals, with more than 1,000 dairy farms told this week that their payments are being delayed due to a financial crisis at the biggest dairy co-operative, First Milk. Poultry farmers now fear a crash in profits, too, as supermarkets turn their attention to chicken in a bid to entice shoppers through their doors. Chicken is Britain’s biggest-selling meat, with around 800million birds reared each year for our tables. And, as it’s a staple food for most households, consumers watch its price more carefully than they do for most goods. It may also be that retailers are trying to reverse a decline in the sale of chicken, following fears about its safety last autumn. The Food Standards Agency revealed then that 70 per cent of whole raw chickens sold by the leading chains were contaminated with the potentially deadly food- poisoning bug campylobacter. Almost one in five of fresh roasting chickens – 18 per cent – were contaminated with the highest levels of the bug. And more than one in 20 carried the germ on the outside of the pack, meaning people picking them up from the shelf to check a price could fall ill. The latest figures by retail analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel suggest consumers may have reacted to the revelations, with 6.8 per cent less chicken being bought in the 12 weeks to December 7 than during the same period in 2013. Scroll down for video . Tesco and Asda have chicken promotions, whereas Sainsbury’s has permanently cut the cost of its 1.35kg chicken by £1 . However, Waitrose, which is selling the cheapest chicken, claimed its price cut was part of a wider half-price promotion on meat. And it insisted that its farmers were not skimping on animal-welfare standards or quality as a result of the low price. ‘The hens have 20 per cent more space than the industry standard, giving our birds the room they need to move freely,’ a spokesman said. ‘Our standards meet the RSPCA’s recommendations and have the support of other key organisations such as Compassion in World Farming.’ Last night the National Farmers Union warned supermarkets against using chicken as a loss leader (a product sold below its market price to entice shoppers into the store). The union’s chief poultry adviser Gary Ford said: ‘Poultry farmers are not averse to promotional activity. 'However, selling products as a loss leader must not be at the expense of producers and others in the supply chain. 'Farmers already face volatile market conditions that make it unpredictable whether they return a profit or not.’ He called for the powers of the supermarket ombudsman to be extended, to eradicate ‘unfair trading practices’.

"Two Florida men who were being pulled over for running a red light are now facing drug charges after a botched effort to ditch a bag of cocaine. Police on patrol in Kissimmee say they had to slam on their brakes at an intersection on Michigan Avenue about 2am Wednesday after a gold Acura didn't stop for the red light. The cops flashed their lights for the car to pull over and shined a spotlight on the vehicle, noticing that the sunroof was being opened. 'I observed the front right seat passenger throw a clear baggie filled with cocaine that landed on the roof of my vehicle,' Kissimmee officer Christopher Breuer wrote in his police report, according to The Smoking Gun. Flying cocaine: Driver Jose Vales, 38 (left), was pulled over for allegedly running a red light in Kissimmee early Wednesday, when passenger Luis Vazquez, 30 (right) flung a bag of cocaine out the sunroof of the car . The car pulled into a nearby 7-11. Breuer said in his report that he hadn't told the two men in the car he had observed the bag being thrown when the driver, Jose Vales, 38, told him it was the passenger, Luis Vazquez, 30, who threw it. 'Vales spontaneously uttered to me that it was Vazquez that threw the ‘baggie’ out of the window,' Breuer reported. Police asked the men if there was anything else illegal to be found in the car and they said no. However a search showed driver Vales had a bag of cocaine - the same type recovered from the police car-  in his front right pocket. Vales told police that Vasquez had planted the drugs on him. 'I asked Vales how did Vasquez do that and Vales stated that he was asked by Vasquez to hold the baggie of cocaine right after they noticed they were being pulled over,' Breuer reported. 'While speaking to Vales, his speech was slurred as if he had been drinking.' Should have used the window: The two men were traveling in a gold Acura similar to the one in this stock image. Police allege a bag of cocaine hurled from the sun roof landed on their car . Police also found a bag of cannabis under the front driver seat. Vales was charged with possession of cocaine, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of cannabis under 20 grams. Vasquez was wanted in Osceola County for battery, the report said. He was charged with possession of cocaine, possession of drug paraphernalia and tampering with evidence. The latter charge was for throwing the baggie. Vales bond was set at $1,500 and Vasquez at $2,500.","Driver Jose Vales, 38, and Luis Vazquez, 30, pulled over early Wednesday .

"Missing airliner MH370 is 'very likely' to be found  and is probably in good condition despite being submerged for ten months, according to the Australian leading the search. Martin Dolan said he is confident of finding the aircraft - which disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 with 239 people on board - but admitted it would take a while. Apart from some mysterious satellite 'pings' interpreted as plotting its southern course, no sign of the jet has been found despite a massive air and sea operation. Scroll down for video . Still missing: The jet disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 and apart from some mysterious satellite 'pings' interpreted as plotting its southern course, no sign of it has been found . Mr Dolan said: 'We are confident that if we are looking in the right area - as we think we are - we will find the aircraft - it's just that it's a very large area, so it's going to take a long time.' Three vessels, with a fourth on the way, are probing the depths of the Indian Ocean off western Australia where the Malaysia Airlines plane carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese, is believed to have crashed. Relatives of those on board have endured a long wait for answers on what happened to their loved ones, with their torment reawakened by AirAsia Flight QZ8501 crashing into the sea off Indonesia on December 28. So far, one quarter of the priority underwater search area of 60,000 square kilometres (23,166 square miles) has been checked, while a wider zone of 208,000 square kilometres has been mapped. Fugro Discovery (pictured), is one of three vessels currently conducting a high-resolution search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . Searching device: An image of a Fugro's autonomous underwater vehicle searching for flight MH370 . 'Our satellite calculations gave us an area we determined was high priority,' Martin Dolan, the chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading the search, told AFP. 'In this 60,000 square kilometres, it's very likely we will find the aircraft, but we don't know exactly where. We just have to cover that area thoroughly until we find the aircraft.' The priority search began in early October and will accelerate over the next few months as weather conditions improve, with the hunt expected to wrap up in May. If the jet is not found, a decision on extending the investigation would be made by Australia and Malaysia, which have jointly shouldered the cost. Mr Dolan said mapping had led to the discovery of previously unknown undersea features such as mountains, volcanos, chasms and a rough, uneven sea floor, highlighting the challenges. To take a closer look at the complex terrain, the Australian and Malaysian governments said Wednesday they were jointly funding the fourth ship, Fugro Supporter, to join the probe later this month. Desperate: A Malaysian woman reads a board filled with messages for the passengers of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on March 25 last year . Tragedy: People stand beside the arrival board showing the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight at Beijing Airport on March 8 last year . While the other three vessels -- Fugro Equator, Fugro Discovery and GO Phoenix -- use sophisticated sonar systems attached to tow cables up to 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) long, the Supporter will have an autonomous underwater vehicle. '(It) can be programmed and cover areas much more thoroughly. It's of course a lot slower,' Mr Dolan said, adding that about five percent of the search area needed the closer scrutiny. 'We need to go slow so that we can be 100 percent sure that we have covered that area totally.' The underwater probe is taking place in treacherous surface conditions with waves as high as 12 metres. Authorities believe the plane may be sitting on the ocean floor at depths of 4,000 metres. But the deep sea plays an important role in preserving the aircraft if that was its resting place, Mr Dolan said. Tribute: A visitor writes on a placard carrying messages for the passengers of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in Kuala Lumpur in June . Continued efforts: A crew member on an Australian search plane scours the ocean during the first month of last year's search for flight MH370 . 'At the likely depth we think the aircraft is, around about 4,000 metres below the sea surface, there's very little going on there... that's likely to affect the components of the aircraft we are looking for,' he said. 'The second is that down there there's very little or no oxygen, so there's not anything in the way of oxidisation or decay going on with aircraft parts. 'The sonar equipment we are using means that -- even if there's an amount of silt or other things -- we can still locate the aircraft parts. 'We are confident there's going to be enough visible parts of the aircraft for us to be able to detect it.' Authorities have drawn up a recovery plan if the plane is found. The proposal, which is still being assessed, would use technology and techniques similar to those deployed to recover Air France flight AF447. The French flag carrier, including its 'black box' flight data recorder, was hauled from the Atlantic nearly two years after it crashed en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on June 1, 2009, killing all 228 on board. Some £65million has so far been jointly committed by Australia and Malaysia to fund the search.

"Most New Yorkers didn't approve of police officers turning their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio at the funerals of two officers shot to death in their patrol car, or of the comment by a union leader that the mayor had 'blood on his hands,' according to a poll released Thursday. The Quinnipiac University poll found that 69 percent disapproved of the silent protest among police at the funerals of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu and 77 percent considered union leader Patrick Lynch's comment 'too extreme.' The poll comes amid a rancorous time between police and the mayor that ramped up during protests over a Dec. 3 grand jury decision not to indict a police officer in the apparent chokehold death of Eric Garner and hit a fever pitch in the weeks since the officers were shot dead Dec. 20 by a mentally disturbed man who vowed online to kill two 'pigs.' Scroll down for video . Coming together: New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, center, between New York City Police commissioner, left, and Rev. Al Sharpton during a discussion following the death of Eric Garner . Lynch, who heads the powerful Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said after the officers' deaths that de Blasio had encouraged anti-police sentiment and had 'blood on his hands.' At the funerals, thousands of officers turned their backs on the mayor. Among the poll results, 77 percent said relations between de Blasio and the police are 'generally bad.' Of those, 45 percent said de Blasio is to blame, while 43 percent blame police. Overall, 56 percent of New Yorkers approved of the way police are doing their jobs and about half approved of how de Blasio is handling crime. Fifty-six percent approved of the job Police Commissioner William Bratton was doing, up from his previous rating. Turning away: Some New York police officers turn away from a screen showing the mayor speaking at the funeral of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu . The poll surveyed 1,182 New York City voters by phone from Jan. 7 to 14. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. A spokesman for the mayor didn't address Thursday's poll specifically. 'The mayor is committed to keeping crime low, ensuring the brave men and women of the NYPD have the tools needed to keep them safe on the job, and bringing police and community closer together,' spokesman Phil Walzak said. Mending fences: Mayor de Blasio addressing a New York City police graduation ceremony at Madison Square Gardens in December last year . In the past few days, the mayor has made a series of moves to align himself more closely with police. On Tuesday, he announced he'd veto a City Council bill that would make chokeholds illegal. The measure is opposed by the NYPD and was drafted after Garner's death in July. The practice is already banned by the NYPD. And on Wednesday, de Blasio used his toughest rhetoric yet to condemn protesters who threaten to harm police. He said that some of the demonstrators 'say really inappropriate, reprehensible things about our police officers — things that I think are actually quite sick, anything that suggests violence toward police.' According to the poll, only 18 percent had a favorable opinion of Lynch. The longtime union leader had no comment Thursday. The poll results also come amid a burst of dissension within the union ranks and Lynch. At a union lunch this week in Queens, a shouting match broke out over Lynch's public battle with de Blasio, with some delegates suggesting his methods weren't effective. Lynch, 51, is seeking a fifth term in June at the union that represents 24,000 cops. No challenger has come forward. De Blasio suggested that the dissension within the union meeting was because Lynch did not speak for all of his members, many of whom now want to 'let their voices be heard.'","Quinnipiac University poll finds 69 per cent disapproved of silent protest .

"Drug cartels in Central American have developed a sleek new smuggling vehicle that is practically impossible for law enforcement to track by radar, crime experts say. The criminals have replaced older, slow boats with sleek 'Picuda' models that are long, thin and can confound detection methods, the analysts said. Picudas can go as much as twice as fast as traditional smuggling vessels while carrying around a one ton of illegal drugs each. Scroll down for video . Speedy: The 'Picuda' boats, shown above being chased by the U.S. Coast Guard, can drastically cut the time it takes smugglers to get from Colombia to destinations such as Costa Rica and Jamaica with their illegal hauls . Long and thin: The boats, packed full of powerful engines, are made of fiberglass, which makes them hard to track . The covert trips, made after dark, often take the smugglers from Colombia, and had on from there to Costa Rica, Honduras or Jamaica to unload their cargo to be sold off. Whereas the trips used to take three days in the older speed boats, they can now be finished in two, according to military publication Dialogo. The new boats also have a more efficient design, which means they use less fuel, saving money and making room for more illegal drugs, the report said. By employing fiberglass as the sole building material for the hulls - rather than just parts as before - the boats have also been made practically impervious to radar, confounding Coast Guard authorities who try to catch them. The boats, which measure 32-38ft long, are equipped with three separate 200 horsepower engines. An equivalent sized fishing boat may have 50 horsepower at its disposal - a twelfth of the power. Tough to keep up: While some are caught, smugglers have been able to outrun smugglers. Above in a British frigate apprehending suspects in the Caribbean . Haul: The boats can carry as much as a ton each of illegal drugs at high speed. Pictured above are bales of marijuana . Adam Isacson, a security expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the developments are another sign of the criminals' high-tech struggle with authorities like the U.S. Coastguard. He told Fox News that the cartels' tooling-up is: 'clearly indicative of the cat-and-mouse game they are playing with the law.' The Coast Guard does sometimes win out over the smugglers. In November they recovered a 580-kilogram stash of cocaine off the coast of Central America. But much continues to slip through, both in boats and in so-called narco-subs - underwater vehicles stuffed with drugs which are extremely difficult to find when they are on the move.","Fiberglass 'Picuda' are packed with motors and can carry a ton of drugs .

"Barack Obama gave David Cameron a pre-election endorsement last night, praising Britain’s economic performance. The two leaders sealed what was dubbed ‘the bro summit’ – after it emerged the US President refers to the Prime Minister privately as his ‘bro’ – with a display of unity at the White House. Suggesting Britain should stick to its economic course, Mr Obama said: ‘On the economy, I would note that Great Britain and the US are two economies that are standing out at a time when a lot of other countries are having problems. So we must be doing something right.’ Scroll down for video . Barack Obama gave David Cameron a pre-election endorsement,  praising Britain’s economic performance . The two leaders sealed what was dubbed ‘the bro summit’ with a display of unity at the White House . Mr Obama went out of his way to repay the favour Mr Cameron gave when he visited the US just months before the 2012 presidential election, including a visit to watch baseball in the swing state of Ohio. That visit angered some Conservative MPs, given that their party is traditionally allied with the Republicans. Yesterday, however, it appeared to have paid off as Mr Obama lavished praise on the Tory leader and the special relationship between the US and the UK. The two leaders struck agreements on a joint ‘cyber cell’ to counter the threat of cyber terrorism and on dispatching thousands more troops to join exercises in Eastern Europe – sending a message to Vladimir Putin. There will also be co-operation on efforts to deradicalise those ‘poisoned’ by Islamic fundamentalists. Mr Cameron weighed in to support Mr Obama in a contentious American political debate. He telephoned leading Republican senators to urge them not to press for new sanctions on Iran rather than continuing diplomatic efforts to persuade the country to abandon its nuclear programme. The Prime Minister said the US President was a ‘great friend to Britain and to me personally’. ‘In the last six years since you became President, and in the nearly five years I have been Prime Minister, we have faced some big issues on our watch,’ he declared. ‘Those challenges have boiled down to one word: security.

"We may all have been cooing at David Beckham's touching outing with his  three-year-old daughter Harper on her scooter this week, but according to a new study, this fatherly behaviour is nothing new. The study contests the widely-held view that there's been a generational shift in attitudes to fatherhood and only today's 'New Man'is more comfortable with his parenting role. Academics from the universities of Manchester and Leeds examined fatherhood in Britain during the 19th and 20th centuries and found strong evidence that dads were far more involved in their children's lives than previously thought. New research shows that humour played a big part in Victorian dads' relationships with their children . The study examined Victorian working class fathers and 20th century dads from the First World War to the start of the Sixties. Dr Julie-Marie Strange, of the University of Manchester, said she was able to disprove the negative stereotypes closely linked with the Victorian working class father as being absent, tyrannical, distant, drunk, violent and resentful of his children. She found that dads of that era were  affectionate with their children, very involved and injected laughter and fun into the home. 'The term ""Victorian father"" has become shorthand for a man that is strict, distant and unaffectionate with his children,' she said. 'And yet fathers are often neglected in histories of family life in Britain. Fathers were more involved with their children in the past than we recognised. 'This shows how firmly the stereotype is imprinted in our culture. But I found little evidence of this austere, absent man in my research.' David Beckham is a hands-on father with Harper, 3, yet research suggests his behaviour is nothing new . Drawing on music hall songs, visual culture and fiction, she discovered how comedy played a crucial in helping dads bond with their children. 'Comedy could be a kind of masculine 'baby talk' too,' she added. Dr Laura King, from the University of Leeds who studied 20th Century fathers, said the history of fatherhood is used to support debates about the state of fatherhood today and the need for change in the future. She said: 'The generalisation that fathers in the past were distant figures - as well as the idea that men have suddenly become much more involved in fatherhood in the last ten or 20 years - don't really match up.' Jamie Oliver spends his free time with his four children but research suggests our forbears worked long hours for their children and didn't need obvious displays of affection as their love was taken for granted . Brad Pitt, seen here at the Unbroken premiere, is seen as the ultimate modern man for sharing childcare . She argues that because they worked a lot, fathers were seen as uninvolved. Kisses and cuddles with their children were also less common so the relationship was seen as less affectionate. She said: 'Lots of men talked about how they worked hard and long hours specifically to give their family what they didn't have as children, and the love and affection between parents and children were simply taken for granted rather than constantly displayed.' She also noted how the birth of modern celebrity dad in the 1940s and 1950s - with newspapers regularly featuring stories about famous fathers such as actors Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster and singer Lonnie Donegan, as well as footballers and other sports stars - gave a 'new understanding of fatherhood'.","Term 'Victorian father' shorthand for someone strict and unaffectionate .

"A married woman has outlined her decision to stop wearing leggings or 'thin, form-fitting yoga pants' in public, for fear of 'enticing' men. '[Wearing leggings] creates a stronger attraction for a man to look at a woman’s body and may cause them to think lustful thoughts,' writes Veronica Partridge, a 25-year-old Christian mother-of-one based in Bend, Oregon, on her namesake blog. Mrs Partridge came to this decision after her husband of five years, motivational speaker Dale Partridge, admitted it was 'hard' not to look at other woman when they wore yoga pants. Scroll down for video . Vow: Mom Veronica Partridge - pictured (left) with her husband Dale Partridge (right) - has outlined her decision to stop wearing leggings or 'thin, form-fitting yoga pants' in public, for fear of 'enticing' men . According to Mrs Partridge, who is undeniably blessed in the looks department, it's a conviction that has been 'weighing heavy' on her heart for months. 'I tried ignoring it for as long as I could,' she writes before describing that God 'changed her heart.' She later asked her husband whether it was possible that leggings could cause a man other than him to 'think lustfully' about her body. 'I appreciated his honesty when he told me, “Yeah, when I walk into a place and there are women wearing yoga pants everywhere, it’s hard to not look. I don’t, but it’s not easy”.' Mrs Partridge surmises that if Dale, who 'loves, honors and respects' her, finds it difficult to 'keep his eyes focused ahead' then perhaps it is even harder for a man with less 'self-control.' She concludes: 'The only time I feel (for myself) it is acceptable to wear them, is if I am in the comfort of my own home or if I am wearing a shirt long enough to cover my rear end.' No more: Mrs Partridge - pictured sporting leggings in March 2013 - is a Christian and says, 'I tried ignoring it for as long as I could,' before describing that God 'changed her heart' regarding her dress code .

Parents: Mrs Partridge surmises that if Dale, who 'loves, honors and respects' her, finds it difficult to 'keep his eyes focused ahead' then perhaps it is even more difficult for a man with less 'self-control' Mrs Partridge concedes that her new dress code does make it difficult for her to find an outfit sometimes, but claims: 'My conscience is clear and I feel I am honoring God and my husband.' Unsurprisingly, the post sparked fierce debate in the comments section. Many users who identified themselves as female Christians asked whether Mrs Partridge would also forgo wearing a swimsuit on the beach, and many likened her vows to 'radical Islam.' One wrote: 'Or you know, we could all just wear giant bags over our bodies with only our eyes exposed,' while another suggested, 'Maybe a burqa would make you feel more comfortable.' Worth it: Mrs Partridge - pictured with her young daughter - concedes that her new dress code does make it difficult  to find an outfit sometimes . Resolved: She claims, 'My conscience is clear and I feel I am honoring God and my husband' Another commenter criticized the 'shame' that gets projected onto females and the tendency to 'make women feel like they are responsible for men's sexual thoughts.' One man however, who describes himself as a 'young, single, concerned American' agreed with Mrs Partridge wholeheartedly. 'You might as well be wearing nothing,' he wrote of leggings, arguing that they were blatantly designed to 'draw attention' rather than for 'comfort.' 'Remember,' he offers. 'Even Jesus said that a married man lusting after another woman has committed Adultery just by having that thought.' Interestingly, in a separate blog post dated November 6 2013, Mrs Partridge writes candidly about her and Dale's early-marriage struggles, and later blamed her own jealously. Trouble in paradise: Interestingly, in a separate blog post dated November 6 2013, Mrs Partridge writes candidly about her and Dale's early-marriage struggles, and later blamed her own jealously . OK for men? Two years ago, Mrs Partridge posted this image of her husband topless, captioned, 'This is MY husband! (7 years ago) Sexy right?!' Describing one 'chaotic' car ride, she writes: 'All of a sudden, my husband just lost it! I was dumbfounded. 'Never have I seen that side of him. I immediately shut my mouth and couldn’t do anything but cry the rest of our drive home.' After then attending marriage counseling at the couple's church, Mrs Partridge wrote: . 'I learned that most of the arguments initiated by myself were because of my ridiculous jealousy, being unreasonable, and passive aggression.' Mrs Partridge insists that her recent blog post and her decision to eschew wearing leggings in public is a personal one. 'I am in NO WAY trying to tell people what they can and cannot wear,' she writes. 'What you wear is entirely your own choice.'","Veronica Partridge is a 25-year-old Christian wife and mother-of-one .

"This is the heart-warming moment a young homeless boy threw his arms around the Pope after Francis made a surprise visit to a centre for slum children in the Philippines today. The Pope was seen warmly embracing the child on a visit to the Anak-Tnk Foundation - a Jesuit charity in the poverty-stricken Intramuros district of Manila which caters for 300 youngsters. The pontiff had earlier delivered a speech urging the nation's leaders to end the corruption which contributes to tens of millions of Catholics living in poverty in the country. Scroll down for video . Warm embrace: The Pope was seen hugging a homeless boy on the second day of his tour of the Philippines . He arrived in the Philippines yesterday and was given an electrifying welcome - enhancing the nation's reputation as the Catholic Church's vibrant Asian bastion. In his first speech of a five-day tour, the Pope took immediate aim at the nation's elite who have for decades enjoyed the spoils of power while the vast majority lived in poverty. 'It is now, more than ever, necessary that political leaders be outstanding for honesty, integrity and commitment to the common good,' the pope said in the speech at the presidential palace. He challenged 'everyone, at all levels of society, to reject every form of corruption, which diverts resources from the poor'. Surprise visit: Homeless children of the Anak-Tnk Foundation, founded in 1998 by a Jesuit priest, got the shock of their lives when Pope Francis turned up today . The 78-year-old pontiff, seen by many around the world as a bold reformer compared with his predecessor, said the 'great biblical tradition' obliged everyone to hear the voice of the poor. 'It bids us break the bonds of injustice and oppression which give rise to glaring, and indeed scandalous, social inequalities,' he said. About 25 million Filipinos, or one quarter of the population, live on the equivalent of 60 cents a day or less, according to the latest official poverty surveys. The poverty has forced more than ten million Filipinos to head overseas in search of a better life. Pope Francis is on a week-long tour of Asia that began in Sri Lanka and ends with a five-day visit to the Philippines . Electrifying welcome: Thousands of Filipino Catholics greeted the Pope at the Mall of Asia Arena earlier today . Francis said one of the main purposes of his trip was to visit survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, which left 7,350 people dead or missing in 2013. He will spend tomorrow in areas of the central Philippines that were devastated by the typhoon, which smashed into coastal communities with the strongest winds ever recorded on land. 'In a particular way, this visit is meant to express my closeness to our brothers and sisters who endured the suffering, loss and devastation caused by Typhoon Yolanda,' the Pope said. While in Tacloban, the pope is expected to get some first-hand experience of the tropical storms and typhoons that claim hundreds of lives each year in the Philippines. Call on leaders: The pontiff delivered a speech today urging the nation's leaders to end the corruption which contributes to tens of millions of Catholics living in poverty . Rock-star status: Pope Francis waves to Filipinos as he rides his Popemobile back to the Apostolic Nunciature after attending the 'Meeting with Families' - which consisted of survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan . A tropical storm in the area will bring 'heavy to intense' rain tomorrow, according to the Philippine weather agency. Monsignor Pedro Quitorio, spokesman for the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, told AFP the pope intended to press on with the Tacloban trip regardless of the weather. The Philippines has long been the Church's stronghold in the region, with Catholics accounting for 80 percent of the former Spanish colony's population. Francis enjoyed a hero's welcome when he arrived on Thursday night, with hundreds of thousands of people crowding the streets of Manila to get a first glimpse of him as he travelled in a motorcade. Too much excitement: Two nuns watch over a faint woman as she is brought from the crowd waiting for Pope Francis at the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Manila today . Massive crowds continued to choke his motorcade route today as he travelled around the city, including near the centuries-old Manila Cathedral where he celebrated mass with priests and nuns. 'My sacrifice was worth it. I feel happy. I feel blessed,' Nanette Hermano, 56, said as she cried after taking a smartphone picture of the Pope outside the cathedral. 'I've been here since 3:00 am, but I don't feel tired, I don't feel hungry. It's like a miracle.' During his first speech, Francis also issued his strongest defense yet of church teaching opposing artificial contraception. Itching to see Il Papa: A nun is pulled from the waiting crowd to get closer to the arrival area of Pope Francis . Another nun was seen fighting her way to the front of the crowd before the Pope's procession arrived . His comments were clearly a nod to the local church, which recently lost a significant fight when President Benigno Aquino III pushed through a reproductive health law that allows the government to provide artificial birth control to the poor. 'Be sanctuaries of respect for life, proclaiming the sacredness of every human life from conception to natural death,' Francis exhorted the crowd. 'What a gift this would be to society if every Christian family lived fully its noble vocation. Later today Francis will lead thousands of people in prayer at Manila's top concert arena, where music fans have flocked in recent years to see the likes of Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift.

If as big as expected, the crowd will surpass the previous record for a papal gathering of five million during a mass by John Paul II at the same venue in 1995. Francis is on a week-long tour of Asia that began in Sri Lanka. It is his second trip to the region in five months, signalling the importance the Vatican places on Asia's growth potential for the Church.

"Ukrainian armed forces mounted a major onslaught against pro-Russian separatists today in an attempt to gain control over the MH17 crash site. It marks a continuation of a days-long offensive which has led them to push back into three towns in the rebel-held regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the past four days, while international investigators desperate to access to downed jet's crash site pull out for fear of being caught in the fighting. On Thursday and Friday Ukrainian forces were pushing into the town of Lysychansk, a strategic centre in Luhansk. Today there were reports that tanks rolled into Shakhtarsk, just ten miles from the site, while Ukraine claimed to have surrounded the rebel stronghold of Horlivka, both in Donetsk. Guns ready: A Ukrainian fighter - a member of a militia sympathetic to the Kiev regime - inspects his rifle atop an armed vehicle in Lysychansk, which soldiers stormed on Thursday and Friday . Flying the flag: Ukrainian fighters hoist their national flag atop an industrial building on the outskirts of Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region, yesterday . Ripping into the Russians: On top of the same building another pro-Ukraine fighter tears the Russian flag in two while his comrade looks after a Ukrainian flag . Rolling into town: Armoured personnel carriers and vehicle-mounted machine guns belonging to the official Ukrainian army were also seen in Lysychansk today . Nationalist: A pro-Ukrainian soldier, part of the Donbass Battalion, with a flag strapped to his rifle patrols Lysychansk yesterday . The fierce combat has prompted a postponement of a trip to the site by a team of Dutch and Australian police officers who had planned to start searching for evidence and the remaining bodies. Ukraine's National Security Council said that government troops have encircled Horlivka, a key rebel stronghold, and that there had been fighting in other cities in the east. Horlivka lies around 20 miles north of the main rebel-held city of Donetsk. Meanwhile, U.S. officials are sharing satellite images they say show Russia has been firing rockets more than seven miles into eastern Ukraine. The State Department today released images it said shows blast marks from where rockets were launched and craters where they landed. Camouflaged: Ukrainian militiamen walk the streets of the fallen town's outskirts after ousting rebel forces and pulling down Russian flags from the buildings . Investigating: Soldiers draw close to a house on a quiet street in Lysychansk yesterday, two days after they first marched into the town in a days-long offensive . All clear: This pro-Ukrainian fighter is one of many leading an attack on Russian separatists across the two rebellious regions of Luhansk and Donetsk . Thirsty work: A fighter on the outskirts of the recaptured town stops for a drink while patrolling an industrial area . Ominous: Smoke is seen rising over Donetsk, the centre of power for the pro-Russian rebels, today as MH17 investigators were held up there . The four-page memo is said to shows strikes between July 21 and July 26. Officials say one image shows rockets have been fired more than  seven miles, into Ukraine from Russian soil. The armed forces 'have increased assaults on territory held by pro-Russian mercenaries, destroyed checkpoints and positions and moved very close to Horlivka,' the council said in a statement. A representative of the separatist military command in Donetsk confirmed that there had been fighting in Horlivka, but said that rebel fighters were holding their positions. Elsewhere, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that a column of Ukrainian armored personnel carriers, trucks and tanks had entered the town of Shakhtarsk, 10 miles west of the site of the Boeing 777 crash. Shakhtarsk is a strategic town in the area. By controlling the town, the Ukrainian army would cut off vital rebel supply lines. Local media reported fighting also taking place in the towns of Snizhne and Torez, the two nearest mid-sized towns to the crash site. The government accused rebel forces of firing rockets Sunday on residential apartment blocks in Horlivka in what they said was an attempt to discredit the army and whip up anti-government sentiment. Tense wait: A Dutch police officer waits in Donetsk in the hope of reaching the MH17 crash site. Their mission was today called off amid safety fears . Demoralising: A forensic inspector from the Netherlands bows his head as it was decided that fighting was taking place too close to the MH17 crash site to venture there . On the ground: Australian police also arrived in Ukraine in the hope of seeing the crash site for themselves, but the mission was put on hold because of the conflict . The separatist self-declared 'Donetsk People's Republic' has accused the army of being responsible for that and other rocket attacks in nearby cities. The Donetsk regional government - which is loyal to Kiev and based elsewhere since rebels took over the area - said Sunday in a statement that at least 13 people, including two children aged one and five, were killed in fighting in Horlivka. It said another five people were killed as a result of clashes in a suburb north of Donetsk. New York-based Human Rights Watch last week condemned what it said was the Ukrainian government forces' practice of using unguided rockets in populated urban areas. It said that use of the rockets was a violation of international humanitarian law that 'may amount to war crimes.' Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was shot down with a surface-to-air missile over a part of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists on July 17, killing all 298 people on board. Crash site: Debris can still be seen where Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 came down more than a week ago, killing all 298 passengers . Display of power: Meanwhile Russian president Vladimir Putin was seen alongside his generals at a military memorial event in a naval base in the north of the country . Russian President Vladimir Putin on a visit to Northern Fleet main naval base of Severomorsk . Russian President Vladimir Putin (centre) and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu (right) watch the Navy Day Military parade  in Severomorsk . U.S. and Ukrainian officials say it was shot down by a missile from rebel territory, most likely by mistake. Ten days after the disaster, a full-fledged investigation still has not begun at the crash site, with some bodies still unrecovered and the site forensically compromised. Concerns about the integrity of the site were raised further when a couple that had flown from their home in Perth, Australia, visited the site Saturday outside the village of Hrabove and even sat on part of plane's wreckage. It remained unclear when the forensic experts from the Netherlands and Australia would be able to begin their work at the site. Alexander Hug, the deputy head of a monitoring team from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said it was too dangerous for the unarmed officers to travel there from their current location in Donetsk. 'We reassess the situation continuously and we will start to redeploy tomorrow morning back to the site if the situation changes,' Hug said. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott had said earlier Sunday that unarmed Australian police would be part of the Dutch-led police force to secure the area and help recover victims' remains. Abbott said that by using unarmed police, Ukraine's Parliament will not need to ratify the deployment as it would if the security force were to be armed. 'This is a risky mission. There's no doubt about that,' Abbott told reporters. 'But all the professional advice that I have is that the safest way to conduct it is unarmed, as part of a police-led humanitarian mission,' he said.

Russia called the latest US accusations of Moscow's involvement in the Ukrainian conflict a baseless 'smear campaign' Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a statement that his country would send dozens of police and that his country had received assurances from pro-Russia separatists that they would provide protection for investigators. Flights from Ukraine to the Netherlands have taken 227 coffins containing victims of the plane disaster. Officials say the exact number of people held in the coffins still needs to be determined by forensic experts in the Netherlands. The Malaysia Airlines disaster prompted some expectations in the West that Russia would scale back its involvement in the uprising in Ukraine's east, but the opposite seems to be the case. Ukraine and the United States have accused Russia of launching artillery attacks onto Ukrainian soil in recent days. These claims have not been definitively verified. Meanwhile, the United States said it has seen powerful rocket systems moving closer to the Ukraine border. In Warsaw, about 250 people marched through the city to protest what they called the 'terror' imposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. Some of the demonstrators carried Ukrainian flags, and there were banners that proclaimed 'Putin is a Sponsor of Terror' and 'Europe, Stop Just Talking. Start Taking Action! Stop Terror in Ukraine.'

"Labour leader Ed Miliband today warned than 1million voters have disappeared ahead of the election. He blamed the government for making changes to the voter registration system which means hundreds of thousands of young people have lost their 'sacred democratic rights'. But Labour's general election handbook, sent to candidates across the country, tells them not to bother with families where no-one has ever voted and instead focus on people who might want Mr Miliband in Number 10. Labour leader Ed Miliband blamed the government for making changes to the voter registration system which means hundreds of thousands of young people have lost their 'sacred democratic rights' Labour has calculated that almost one million people have dropped off the electoral register in the last year as a result of what the party says was the 'hasty' way the Government introduced individual voter registration - intended to reduce electoral fraud - without proper safeguards. It says that many of the missing voters are young people - in part due to the decision to end the block registration by universities and colleges of students living in halls of residence. University cities and towns such as Cardiff, Liverpool, Newcastle, Southampton, Leicester, Nottingham, Brighton and Hull have all seen five-figure falls in the numbers of registered voters, according to Labour, while in London the numbers are down by almost 100,000. Labour's General Handbook advises candidates on which houses to target when knocking on doors . Mr Miliband promises to lead a 'national mission' to ensure young voters were able to hold the coalition leaders to account on May 7. In a highly-critical speech, Mr Miliband said: 'This government has betrayed young people. Having broken their promises on tuition fees to young people, having failed to build the economy that will work for them, having short-changed their future, this is David Cameron and Nick Clegg's final insult to young people. 'They are sitting by and watching hundreds of thousands of young people in our country lose their sacred democratic rights. We will not allow this scandal to happen and no right-thinking person should either.' But the handbook sent to Labour candidates warns against 'watsing too much volunteer time' on people unlikely to vote. It states: 'The only people you should not be prioritising are those who live in a household where:… no-one has ever voted, no-one has a postal vote, no-one has turned 18 since 2010 and no-one has moved in since 2010.' Activists are also told to steer clear of homes when people plan to vote Tory or have 'formally asked us never to contact them again'. Labour's attack on the electoral roll numbers has also been rubbished by the Electoral Commission. An Electoral Commission spokesman said: 'It has always been known that some areas with large student populations would initially see a fall in the number of students on their register and that extra effort would be needed to ensure as many as possible are on the register before the April 20 deadline. 'Electoral registration officers all have detailed plans in place to target areas with high student populations. This work will continue right up until the registration deadline.' The guidance recommends that activists do not prioritise households where no-one has ever voted . Lib Dem MP Tom Brake said that many of the 'missing' student voters would still be on the electoral roll but would have previously been registered twice. 'Labour must have forgotten they began the policy of individual electoral registration while they were in government and still support it in principle,' he said. 'Instead of scaremongering, Labour should be working with their own local authorities to ensure that the large amount of money available is spent helping people, particularly students, register to vote.' Darren Hughes, Deputy Chief Executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: 'It's good to hear Ed Miliband join the chorus of voices warning about the number of people in danger of falling off the electoral register. While it was sensible to move on from the Victorian-era system of household registration, there have been real concerns about making the switch so close to an election. 'It's now the duty of everyone concerned, including central government, local authorities, the voluntary sector and all the political parties, to find those missing millions and make sure they don't lose out on their most basic civic right.'","Miliband to warn thousands of young people will miss out on voting .

"What woman wouldn't want to get that red carpet feeling and be treated like royalty for the day - all you have to do is bring your own Prince Charming. Well that may now be possible after a Gold Coast company has upped their luxury levels by launching a new Cinderella limousine. The stretch limo, which is the first of it's kind in Australia, comes complete with a middle extended 2.4m high carriage section, a personal handsome chauffeur and best of all, it won't turn into a pumpkin after midnight. A Gold Coast company has upped their luxury levels by launching a new Cinderella limousine . Costing $350 per hour, the life of opulence doesn't come cheap, but owners, Russian-born couple Alena and Slava Kouzmenkov, say the 'amazing vehicle' is worth every penny. The couple, who have been living in Australia for the past 15 years started their business in Europe and brought LuxCars to Australia with the hope of upping the limousine game here. Alena told Daily Mail Australia that the unique idea for the Chrysler 300cc limousine was inspired by Queen Elizabeth’s famous English coach, the Britannica. 'We thought 'why don't we do something like that but without the horses?'', Alena said. The stretch limo, which is the first of it's kind in Australia, comes complete with a middle carriage section, a personal handsome chauffeur and best of all, it won't turn into a pumpkin after midnight . The Cinderella limo was inspired by Queen Elizabeth's famous coach . 'It took us quite a long time to put it together and then it took us probably about two years to get the engineering done,' 'We  initially provided a luxury limousine service overseas, working in both Europe and Asia but we wanted to bring the same European service here to the beautiful sunshine land.' Alena said the inside of the carriage is 'lovely' and is decked out with a bar, disco lights, music and features gold pillows and curtains set up for a prince of princess. The lavish red velvet interiors are set off by a huge plasma TV and a set of champagne glasses which finish off the inside of the carriage, which Alena stresses is very private. Costing $350 per hour, the life of opulence doesn't come cheap, but owners, Russian-born couple Alena and Slava Kouzmenkov, say the 'amazing vehicle' is worth every penny . 'You can't see the driver and the driver can't see you so it's very very private,' she said.

"The FBI is warning law enforcement agencies across the country that the grand jury decision over Michael Brown's shooter 'will likely' lead to violence by extremist protesters. As the city of Ferguson waits on edge to see whether police officer Darren Wilson will be charged in the death, the agency has issued a bulletin warning departments across the country of potential dangers. It warns that peaceful protests could be interrupted by extremists, while 'hacktivist' groups like Anonymous could also use it as an excuse to launch cyber attacks on authorities, reported ABC. 'The announcement of the grand jury's decision… will likely be exploited by some individuals to justify threats and attacks against law enforcement and critical infrastructure,' it said. Scroll down for video . Anticipation: Pattie Canter, left, who supports officer Darren Wilson, argues with a supporter of his victim Michael Brown in Clayton, Missouri on Monday. The FBI has warned of extremist violence in coming days . The agency warned that the extremists could be carrying 'bladed weapons or firearms' and be 'equipped with tactical gear/gas masks, or bulletproof vests'. The bulletin, seen by ABC, says there have already been threats against law enforcement, including a message last week by a black separatist group offering 'a $5,000 bounty' for Wilson's location. It adds that the extremists may also threaten peaceful, legal protests carried out by demonstrators - both in Ferguson and across the U.S. After the bulletin was issued, some police departments issued internal memos urging officers to review procedures for responding to mass demonstrations, ABC reported.

"It looks like a scene from a magical kingdom with fog snaking between the mountains like a river. The fog, which stretches through the mountains for around 200 miles, was photographed from a helicopter by landscape photographer Victor Liu, who described the scene as being like 'a paradise'. The low clouds have actually settled between the southern continental ranges of the Canadian Rockies, where the tallest mountain - Mount Assiniboine - stands at 11,870ft high. Scroll down for video . Breathtaking: Photographer Victor Liu took a set of amazing photographs of clouds nestling snake-like in the Canadian Rockies . The long game: Mr Liu estimated that the clouds wound their way through the mountains for about 200 miles . On cloud nine: The amazing scene was shot from a helicopter flying about 8,000 feet from the ground . Feeling peaky: The tallest mountain in the Canadian Rockies stands at a lofty 11,870ft high - but these clouds were nestled about 6,500ft up . The rare view was taken from 8,000 to 8,500ft high with the fog nestling in between the mountains, which sit on the Alberta and British Columbia border, in Canada, 5,000 to 6,500ft from the ground. Mr Liu, 35, said: 'I felt like I was flying above a magical kingdom or another planet. 'Even the pilot was shocked by the scene, because he had rarely flown under such weather conditions. 'It felt like being in a paradise with no civilization, but only miles and miles of beautiful landscape.' 'I especially love these pictures because they show a unique view of the Canadian Rockies, which I have been shooting from the ground for years, but only occasionally from the air. Impressed: The scene was so fantastical that even the helicopter pilot was amazed by it, according to Mr Liu .

"They have had a rocky relationship since the start. But in December things came to an ugly head as exes Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler - who have two children together - were both arrested in Los Angeles for threatening to kill each other, TMZ reported. This run-in with the law only came to light on Friday when legal papers surfaced. Scroll down for video . Not a good way to enjoy the holidays: Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler were both arrested in early December for threatening to kill each other, according to a Friday report from TMZ; here they are seen in 2005 . Travis and Shanna - who were married from 2004 to 2008 - were 'handcuffed and thrown in the back of squad cars for making criminal threats against each other on December 7,' the site claimed. First the singer threatened to kill her then the blonde model did the same back, it was alleged. They are both 39-years-old. TMZ claimed Barker of Blink- 182 'got in a verbal fight over a reality show Travis wants to do with their two kids.' They have two kids together: The exes looking happy in Malibu in 2007 . The family already starred together in the reality show Meet The Barkers from 2005 to 2006. The site, which has seen the arrest documents, said the musician was quoted as saying, 'If I could, I'd put a bullet in your head.' Moakler called police that came to their LA home, it was added. After fighting some more in front of the officers, they were handcuffed and 'taken to the station,' the site noted. The former Playboy model said that they have not been getting along and he regularly calls her a 'b****.' He spends a lot of time with their kids: The Blink - 182 singer with  daughter Alabama Luella  (L front), son Landon Asher (R front) and Shanna's daughter with her ex, boxer Oscar de la Hoya, Atiana Cecilia at Nickelodeon's  Kids' Choice Awards in March . She maintained that he also called her 'a ""f***ing piece of garbage' and has said she is 'a cigarette smoking, coke-snorting bitch."" The former beauty queen also has an email in which he said, 'My poor kids have a wh*** for a mom.' Sources told TMZ charges will not be filed against either one but The LA County Department Of Children And Family Services 'was contacted and they are investigating,' TMZ added. Together they have daughter Alabama Luella and son Landon Asher. Shanna also has a daughter with her ex, boxer Oscar de la Hoya. Her name is Atiana Cecilia. On Thursday the former reality star posted a sultry selfie to Instgram with the caption, 'Bored so I've been playing with make up.'

"In a bid to help potential recruits get a real feel for life as an Army Reservist, the Ministry of Defence is turning to virtual reality. During a series of events in London and Manchester today, the recruits will be fitted with Oculus Rift headsets and dropped into virtual training exercises. One will reveal what it's like to take part in a live fire exercise on Salisbury Plain, while another will let wearers take part in a mission in a Challenger 2 tank. During a series of events in London and Manchester, Army Reservist recruits will be fitted with Oculus Rift headsets (picutred) and dropped into virtual training exercises. One will reveal what it's like to take part in a live fire exercise, while another will let wearers take part in a mission in a Challenger 2 tank . The events are taking place at Waterloo station in London and at Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens. The experiences were created by London-based Visualise, and begin when the user takes a seat in a Range Rover. The Rift headset is made by Oculus, a virtual reality firm which initially received funding for the device through Kickstarter. The Norwegian Army is trialling a system that uses the Oculus Rift to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch. Cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset, creating the illusion that the tank is ‘transparent.’ When a driver looks left, they see footage from the left camera, and vice versa on the right - achieving a 360-degree view of the road. By lowering their gaze and looking down towards the vehicle belts, the driver can also use the system to parallel park 'with a precision of up to a centimetre', without the assistance of the vehicle commander. It also removes the blind spots that occur when driving large vehicles. It raised more than $2 million dollars (£1.3 million) in 2012, and last year Oculus was bought by Facebook for $2 billion (£1.3 billion). Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said at the time of the acquisition: 'Oculus [is] the clear leader in something that has the potential to be the next important, or one of the next most important, computing platforms.' The headset is yet to go on consumer sale, although it is available online as a development kit for around £230 ($350). The first Army experience that uses the headset will drop the wearer into a live fire exercise with virtual members of the Army Reserve at the Ministry's Salisbury Plain Training Area. As a crewman in a Challenger 2 tank, in the second experience, the wearer will be surrounded by other tanks engaging enemy positions using laser sights. They will also be able to communicate with other soldiers in armoured vehicles driving alongside. The Army said it will add further experiences in the future. The Army's new recruitment campaign, which involves a new TV advert that will be on show at the drive, comes as new research reveals one in four people said they felt challenge and excitement was missing from their job.

According to the Army, a One Poll survey revealed that around seven in 10 people would consider volunteering or a part-time job alongside their normal work. And one in four said they would consider joining the Army Reserves to 'find that challenge and excitement'. The MoD offers a '100% Army Fit' app (pictured) to help recruits build their fitness to the level of a soldier in training . Major General Chris Tickell, director-general of the Army recruiting and training division, said: 'This research tells us that people feel their day jobs are lacking challenge, excitement and the opportunity to travel - all of which are available at a world-class standard with the Army Reserve. 'By using the virtual headsets, people will be able to step straight into an exciting real-world scenario of volunteering with the Army Reserve and the huge variety of challenging roles there are to choose from. 'Introducing virtual reality technology is just one of the ways that the Army is transforming the way it recruits. The Army recently introduced a simplified, online application form for mobile, tablet or desktop to help people sign up. It also offers a '100%  Army Fit' app that helps new recruits build their fitness to the level of a soldier in training,  and new mobile recruitment offices. Henry Stuart, the managing director of Visualise, added: 'This is the first time virtual reality has ever been used for recruitment purposes and to me, the Army are the perfect client to achieve this world-first with, as an organisation that has always mixed tradition with cutting-edge technology. 'As virtual reality becomes ever-more mainstream, the applications of it widen. From launching cars for Mercedes by allowing you to sit alongside Lewis Hamilton as he tears around a racetrack, to allowing members of the public to become instant virtual holidaymakers with Thomas Cook, we are seeing brands around the world over sit up and take notice of the possibilities.'","Headset will let wearers experience tasks carried out by Army reservists .

"A Washington state couple who use medical marijuana and own a marijuana dispensary have been reunited with their five-year-old son after losing custody, with child protective services saying they were not fit parents because they were high all the time. Jesse and Vicca Thompson, from Sedro-Wolley, where marijuana is legal, were also accused of feeding their second child, a 13-year-old son, a weed-laced cake product 'because he gets aggressive and is too mean sometimes'. According to ABC's 20/20, the couple had their children taken from them in November, and their store, called the Grow Shop, was shut down shortly after following the allegations they were feeding edible products to minors. '(Using marijuana) just means I have an elevated mood,' Vicca Thompson told the show. Reunited: Jesse and Vicca Thompson - campaigners for recreational marijuana who own a small dispensary in Washington - lost custody of their five-year-old son, Jerry, last year, for being unfit parents. They posted this photo to Facebook after Jerry back, with his shirt saying marijuana is safer than Child Protective Services . High all the time: Vicca and Jesse Thompson say their marijuana use - which is for medical purposes and legal - does not affect their ability to parent . 'It doesn't mean I'm incapacitated or that I can't think straight. 'I'm pot right now, and I'm able to parent.' Jesse Thompson, a cancer survivor, has a marijuana prescription for pain, while his wife uses it for arthritis and a nervous condition. He said their troubles started not from their parenting but from firing an employee at their store. 'About a month later, she ... called CPS (Child Protective Services),' Jesse said. 'She told them that we not only are feeding our children marijuana all the time, but that they have access to it in our home and in our business.' That is when the Thompson's lost custody of their five-year-old, Jerry. A few days later child services called to interview Jerry's stepbrother, Sohani, 13, who is Vicca's son from a previous marriage. The boy told authorities his mother had given him a 'goo ball', a peanut butter raisin ball medicated with psycho-active marijuana they sell in their shop. 'He gets aggressive and is too mean, sometimes ... and just needs to ... look inside and relax,' Vicca said. Business: The couple own and run The Grow Shop, a small medical marijuana dispensary and garden store . Jerry was sent to live live with an aunt while Sohani was sent to stay with his biological father. The Thompsons were only allowed to see Jerry at a CPS office. 'It’s destroying me,' Jesse said. 'I can’t not be with my son. He is all that matters.' Vicca added: 'I felt like my heart might stop.' The Thompsons lost one fight to get Jerry back. Jerry tested positive for THC during a hair follicle exam. CPS maintained the two are unfit parents and pose a risk to Jerry's well-being by feeding him marijuana. The couple say they had never given their son marijuana. However Vicca said she once rubbed a marijuana salve on Jerry's skin to treat a rash, but he would not have had any mind-altering effects. Back together: Jesse and Vicca Thompson with a photo of sons Sohani and Jerry . Edibles: The Thompsons' older son told authorities his mother had fed a cake product that was laced with cannabis. Pictured here is some marijuana edibles Vicca Thompson posted to her Facebook . Earlier this month, a court commission said there was no evidence of THC in Jerry's body. It was then determined the Thompsons posed no serious harm to their child. Jerry was allowed to return home with his parents on January 7. However the commissioner set strict conditions. If Jerry ever tests positive for THC he will be removed. 'We’re going to hide the marijuana,' Vicca Thompson told 20/20. 'I definitely feel like I shouldn’t give it to children.'","Jesse and Vicca Thompson lost custody of their son in November .

"A terrified woman was forced to make a desperate 999 call while locked in a bathroom as neighbours fatally stabbed her cousin to death in the next room. Half-brothers Gavin Harris, 39, an ex-soldier, and  Raymond Ball, 33, both of Risca, Caerphilly, stabbed epileptic neighbour Stephen 'Lammy' Lambert with kitchen knives leaving blood 'bubbling' from their victim's chest, a court heard. Today they were jailed for life for hacking their neighbour to death 'like a piece of meat' following the drunken row. Raymond Ball (pictured right) lived on the same street as victim Stephen Lambert - he and his brother Gavin Harris (left) fatally stabbed their epileptic neighbour to death following a row at Mr Lambert's home in Risca . A court heard Mr Lambert had fallen out with the half-brothers and asked them to leave his flat. The pair then grabbed knives, stabbing him five times and leaving him with fatal wound . When police arrived they found Mr Lambert, 36, lying on a settee saturated in his blood. He told them, 'I can't breathe,' as they fought to save his life. Prosecutor Peter Rouch QC told Cardiff Crown Court: 'The blood was bubbling from a stab wound to his chest as they went in.' Cardiff Crown Court heard how the trio had been drinking together and listening to music shortly before the brutal attack. During the attack, on August 27 last year at the victim's home in Risca, Mr Lambert's terrified cousin Louise Whatley told an operator in a harrowing 999 call: 'Two men are stabbing him with knives and I've locked myself in the bathroom.' Stephen Lambert, 36, (pictured) died after being fatally stabbed by the brothers at his home in Risca . She watched the pair 'hacking at Stephen Lambert like a piece of meat' before locking herself in the toilet and phoning 999. Prosecutor Peter Rouch QC said: 'The call was taped and it's a harrowing call . 'Mr Lambert could be heard coughing, groaning and crying out in the background. 'She went back out when the two left and tried to stop the bleeding and comfort him, saying to the operator, ""He sounds as if he is really hurting."" Mr Lambert was unresponsive and unconscious when he arrived at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport with stab wounds to his chest, right arm and thigh. Doctors attempted a major 'clamshell' surgical procedure, used only in extreme emergencies, and opened up his body through skin, muscle, rib cage and diaphragm, but he could not be saved. The fatal chest wound was 10cm deep and had gone through his ribs and an artery while a second 11cm-deep wound in his leg had partially severed a vein, the prosecutor said. Violence started  after the group indulged in an evening of drinking from three-litre bottles of cider. Harris and Ball, who told police Mr Lambert had been his best friend, had earlier been seen with knives tucked into their waistbands after a separate incident. They were seen putting the weapons behind cushions when they went to Mr Lambert's home. One witness said Ball was 'drunk, hyper and acting macho'. The court heard Mr Lambert  told Ball to leave before a struggle began between Mr Lambert and Ball, as Harris tried pull them apart. Mr Rouch said Ball then ran to the kitchen and searched the drawers before grabbing a blade from the draining board. 'When he returned screaming, 'I'm going to stab you,' Ms Whatley went into shock and froze as she saw the knife 'ramming down' towards her cousin's leg,' said Mr Rouch. 'As he shouted, 'Stop it,' she saw blood on the blade.' Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard Mr Lambert was left with blood 'bubbling' from a chest stab wound . Harris was then said to have gone to the cushion where he had hidden his knife and picked it up. 'Both of them, then with knives, were stabbing at him', Mr Rouch said. 'Louise Whatley locked herself in the bathroom and dialled 999.' Ms Whatley told police Mr Lambert was 'like a brother' to her. In a victim impact statement she said: 'It was horrific. I have horrible flashbacks and nightmares.' After the attack the brothers were at another flat where Ball told a man: 'I've just stabbed Lambert.' Harris and Ball both admitted murder. Judge Mrs Justice Nicola Davies DBE said: 'This was a frenzied attack on a defenceless man. 'Nothing Stephen Lambert said or did should have led to this vicious and senseless stabbing. 'The victim was in his own home where he was entitled to feel safe. 'The horrific attack was witnessed by his cousin.' Harris was jailed for 21 years and eight months, Ball was jailed for 22 years and six months.","Half-brothers Gavin Harris, 25, and Raymond Ball, 33, stabbed neighbour .

"A lorry driver has been jailed for seven years for killing his friend who asked him to test out his new 'bulletproof' vest - with a shotgun. Ian Catley, 40, and close friend Philip Harper were in a farmer's field near Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, when he fired at his chest from less than 20ft away and killed him almost instantly. A court heard today that Mr Harper had visited a military surplus store the previous day and was 'very keen' to test the effectiveness of his new kit. Ian Catley, 40, (left) has been jailed for seven years after he killed his friend Philip Harper (right) with a shotgun when he was asked to help him try out his new 'bulletproof' vest . Prosecutor Martin Mulgrew described it as a 'protective' vest, although the victim believed it to be bullet-proof. Southwark Crown Court was told that after leaving Rugby Trading International Ltd in Warwickshire he went to the pub the following evening - June 29 last year - wearing the vest and a SWAT cap. He had already asked another friend - James Hill - to help him test it out but he had flatly refused and then asked more people when he got to the pub. Prosecutor Mr Mulgrew said that the vest - far from being bulletproof - had a plastic casing that actually funnelled the shotgun spray into the centre of Mr Harper's chest, slicing an artery. He added that Mr Catley attempted to save his friend: 'He was panicking, upset and swearing. When Catley fired his shotgun (file image) at Mr Harper from less than 20ft away, the shotgun spray was funnelled into the centre of his chest, slicing an artery. Paramedics were called but he died almost instantly . 'But it was clear to the paramedics at first sight that there was very little that could be done to save Mr Harper's life.' He said Catley had first claimed he had been aiming for a pigeon and hit his friend by accident, but quickly came clean. Mr Harper bought what was described as a 'protective' vest, which he incorrectly believed was bullet-poof like the one pictured. File photo . Defence barrister Mark McDonald argued that the killing was the result of a stupid and reckless act to which the 'keen' Mr Harper had nevertheless consented. '(Mr Harper) was very proud of it. He'd gone to the pub that evening wearing that vest and indeed a SWAT cap,' Mr McDonald said. 'After a drink or so, he asked more people, and Mr Catley agreed to do a stupid and undoubtedly reckless act.' He pleaded guilty to manslaughter last November and appeared in the dock today for sentencing. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC, handing down the sentence, said: 'You shot Mr Harper at a distance of less than 20 feet, causing him catastrophic injuries and immediate death. 'You then, straight away, took him to hospital but tragically, nothing could be done to save his life.' Catley stared straight ahead in the dock as the sentence came down, while his mother appeared to fight back tears from the public gallery. The court heard the two friends had been close and Catley had nightmares about what he had done. 'Your remorse is complete and genuine,' the judge said. 'You recognise the magnitude of your actions and I have no doubt that the effects of killing your good friend will last with you for the rest of your life.' But he said Catley, as a gun licence-holder, had 'manifestly breached those obligations and duties'. Catley will serve up to half his seven-year term, and the judge ordered that his gun be forfeited and destroyed.

"The first ever record of an oceanic shark giving birth has been uncovered by scientists. The photo, taken off Malapascua Island in the Philippines, reveals the body of an elusive baby thresher shark emerging from its mother. But the image by Australian photographer, Attila Kaszo, was left lying in a junk computer folder for years after biologists failed to spot its significance. Scroll down for video . The first record of an oceanic shark giving birth has been uncovered by scientists. The photo, taken in the Philippines several in 2013, reveals the body of an elusive baby thresher shark emerging from its mother . While researchers know that most shark species give birth to live young, the conditions under which they do so has been a mystery. Researchers believe this image could help shed light on how and where sharks give birth. Lead researcher Dr Simon Oliver from the University of Chester told BBC News that seeing the image was one of the most exciting moments of his career. The shark was at a seamount – or undersea mountain – which acts as an area where the creatures can clean themselves by having parasites eaten away by smaller fish wrasse. The image was captured off Malapascua Island in in the Visayan Sea, 4.2 miles (6.8km) across a shallow strait from the northernmost tip of Cebu Island . For sharks, there is no place like home. This is especially true when these magnificent creatures want to give birth after having wandered far and wide across the planet’s oceans for several years at time. A 20-year study, conducted in the Bahamas, shows that despite their impressive travels, female lemon sharks always return to the same location where they were born to give birth. The idea of females returning to their place of birth has been shown in a number of marine species, including salmon and sea turtles. The international team, who reported their findings in the journal Molecular Ecology, said this is the first time this behaviour has been seen sharks. ‘We used each shark’s individual DNA fingerprint to construct a large family tree,’ explained Dr Kevin Feldheim at The Field Museum and the lead author of the study. ‘We found that new born sharks captured in the mid-1990s left the safety of the islands when they were between five and eight years old. 'We observed a large female pelagic thresher shark swimming back and forth across a cleaning station in an agitated state,' Dr Oliver wrote in the journal Coral Reefs. 'We were unable to decipher the cause of the shark's distress from our observation post 50ft (15 metres) away, although it was evident that cleaner wrasse were taking bites from its pelvic region. 'We observed the shark for a total of four minutes, during which we took its photograph for identification purposes.' Researchers believe that this area also serves as a pupping ground, and that images of more sharks giving birth could be taken in the future. Tese creatures are endangered as a result of human activities. Sharks live a long time and take many years to mature, which is one reason why they are extremely vulnerable to overfishing . 'It may well be, or at least the first time that the event has been photographed, but this is always difficult to say definitively,' Dr Simon Thorrold, a senior scientist from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts told the BBC. Thresher sharks, also known as fox sharks, received their name due to their predatory habits. Unlike other shark species, thresher sharks use their whip-like tail to swat-and-swipe at schools of fish, allowing them to stun and eat their prey. But these creatures are endangered as a result of human activities. Sharks live a long time and take many years to mature, which is one reason why they are extremely vulnerable to overfishing . All three thresher shark species are listed as either 'Threatened' or 'Vulnerable' to extinction by the IUCN Red List.

"Johnny Kormondy was put to death Thursday after a meal of fried alligator tail, fried okra, fried shrimp, fried eggs, hash browns, vanilla ice cream and cream soda . Florida has executed the convicted ringleader of a 1993 home-invasion robbery that ended with the murder of a Pensacola banker and the rape of his wife. Johnny Shane Kormondy was pronounced dead at 8.16pm Thursday at Florida State Prison, shortly after the lethal injection was administered. Kormondy's last meal consisted of fried alligator tail, fried okra, fried shrimp, fried eggs, hash browns, vanilla ice cream and cream soda. His final words were, 'I pray to Jesus Christ, son of God, I'm coming home.' The execution was delayed by two hours by a late appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court that was eventually denied. The 42-year-old Kormondy and two associates were convicted of forcing their way into the Pensacola home of Gary and Cecilia McAdams in 1993. Gary was fatally shot, and Cecilia raped repeatedly. Kormondy and two other men killed McAdams with a gunshot to the back of his head during the home-invasion robbery and raped McAdams' wife, Cecilia McAdams, repeatedly. It happened after the couple returned home from their high school reunion. Kormondy's accomplices received life prison terms and Kormondy, who was identified as the ringleader, was sentenced to death. The killer wanted his sentence reduced to life in prison because that is what his co-defendants received. Defense lawyers said Kormondy has been denied due process because the Florida Board of Executive Clemency has not taken up a death sentence case in more than 30 years. Horrific: Kormandy was the ringleader of a 1993 home invasion in Pensacola in which banker Gary McAdams was ambushed and shot dead while his wife Cecilia was raped repeatedly . Kormondy was initially convicted in 1994 but the Florida Supreme Court questioned whether the sentencing phase of his trial was fair. Cecilia McAdams sat for a WEARTV interview on Wednesday and said, in part: . 'I was told by a friend of mine that this might not be something I want to witness, just don't know if you understand what you're going to see. 'And I said, nothing can be worse than the sight of my husband lying dead on our kitchen floor.' Mrs. McAdams watched Kormondy die and said afterward, 'My family and I have waited 21 long years for this day to happen...He needed to die.' She has spoken openly about the rape and her husband's death and has done extensive work on behalf of other victims. Kormondy is the 21st inmate executed under Gov. Rick Scott. The same number of prisoners was put to death under former Gov. Jeb Bush. The death penalty was reinstated in Florida in 1979. Cecilia McAdams said following Kormondy's execution: 'My family and I have waited 21 long years for this day to happen...He needed to die' McAdams sat for an interview on Wednesday, in which she said she was warned that watching someone die would be unpleasant, regardless of what he'd done, to which she replied, 'Nothing can be worse than the sight of my husband lying dead on our kitchen floor'","Johnny Kormondy and two associates forced their way into the Pensacola home of Gary McAdams, who was shot dead with a shotgun .

"When a high school senior made a wager with the Sacremanto King's Nik Staukas, the NBA rookie thought his end of the bet was safe. Jamie Guerra from Woodhaven High School in Detroit asked how many retweets it would take for player to agree his girlfriend, Taylor Anderson,  could be his prom date. Not expecting he would get anywhere near the target, Stauskas and Anderson agreed 10,000, but a short time later the pair were forced to concede defeat after Guerra flew past the figure.

I'm gonna come as well and ay what's up to you guys.' During the back and forth, Miss Anderson asked: 'What did Nik get me in to?' Then she shared her concern after other NBA player and professional athletes started sharing the student's tweet. Arizona Cardinal Bradley Sowell was one of those who helped the student get to his target. Miss Anderson then asked Guerra to give her an impressive 'promposal' to seal the deal. On Friday however, she posted: 'Let's be real... Everyone wants to see Nik more than me anyways.' Then, hours later, she uploaded the message: 'Done with Twitter for awhile. Can't can't take all these notifications anymore.' Guerra's story quickly spread on the internet and the news channels. It even featured on ESPN.

"A grovelling John Kerry hugged and kissed French president Francois Hollande in a show of contrition after nobody important from the White House joined a solidarity march in the wake of the terror attack on Paris. The Secretary of State even brought back-up for his visit in the form of singer James Taylor, who patched up the United States's oldest diplomatic relationship with a rendition of 'You've got a friend'. Arriving at the presidential Elysée Palace, Kerry reached out his hands for Hollande, embraced him closely, then appeared to kiss him on the cheek in an awkward display for the cameras. He later gave a message from the American people, delivered in almost-fluent French. Scroll down for video . Close relationship: Secretary of State John Kerry leaned in to embrace French president Francois Hollande on a make-up visit after missing an enormous solidarity march last week . Hollande told Kerry the two countries must 'find together appropriate responses' to terror attacks . Show of solidarity: The Secretary of State brought along singer James Taylor, right, to give a rendition of 'You've got a friend' at Paris City Hall . Together: John Kerry (right, with French President Francois Hollande) arrived in Paris this morning, more than a week after the first terror attack on the office's of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo . None too subtle: The crooner played You've got a friend, as well as French national anthem La Marseillaise - to emphasize ties between France and the United States. Left, Kerry watches the performance with Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo . Hollande and Kerry made sure to present a very public display of togetherness during the visit, with this awkward hug outside of the Elysee Palace . ''You've been victims yourself of an exceptional terrorist attack on September 11 . Kerry told Hollande: 'I wanted to tell you personally of the horror and revulsion that all Americans felt at these cowardly and despicable attacks against innocent victims and fundamental values.' But despite his best efforts, he stumbled when pronouncing 'dégoût' - the French word for revulsion. Kerry was not available to personally join Hollande and leaders from dozens of other Western nations last week when they marched in solidarity with the victims of an armed terrorist massacre. The White House later admitted it was a mistake not to send a high-profile representative, and said Barack Obama would have liked to go to honor the deaths of staff at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. State Department officials denied that Kerry had apologized for American absence at the march - or that the current event was his way of saying sorry. But French officials said he had already apologized in private. Singer-songwriter James Taylor was Kerry's weapon of choice for the public make-up with the French, often lauded as the U.S.'s 'oldest ally'. At an acoustic performance in Paris's city hall, Taylor strummed French national anthem La Marseillaise, then serenaded Kerry, Hollande and the mayor of Paris with his 1971 hit 'You've got a friend.' Hero: Also present at the Elysée Palace was Lassana Bathily (pictured), the man who saved several Jewish shoppers during a hostage situation in Paris last week . Honoured: The Malian immigrant, pictured here greeting US Secretary of State John Kerry, is being granted French citizenship in light of his heroics . America's absence has received widespread criticism, although Kerry has contended US officials had been 'deeply engaged' with French authorities since the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack. He said attacking the Obama administration was 'sort of quibbling a little bit' - despite the White House's backpedaling. 'Our Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched,' Kerry stated. Kerry - who couldn't attend because of existing commitments - told a news conference on Thursday:  'I don't feel any other exigencies, other than continuation of our friendship and our responsibilities as good friends and the longest ally in our history, and that's why I am going.' But French foreign minister Laurent Fabius - who accompanied Kerry to view wreaths laid outside the Jewish supermarket targeted in last week's terror attacks - said today Kerry had 'apologised'. While the two were getting close outside the Elysee Palace, one of Paris's main stations had to be evacuated after a bomb scare . The US Secretary of State certainly made good on his promise to give a 'big hug' to Paris during the visit . Kerry was joined by French foreign minister Laurent Fabius on a trip to see the wreaths outside the Charlie Hebdo offices . Twelve were killed in last Wednesday's brutal attack by brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi - who were angry at the satirical magazine's cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed . Sunday's march, attended by leaders from across the world, was a show of unity with the magazine and a rally for free speech . Kerry also met with Hollande, who thanked Kerry for his country's support as the two undertook a very public show of togetherness outside the Elysee Palace. 'You've been victims yourself of an exceptional terrorist attack on September 11. You know what it means for a country. ... We must find together appropriate responses,' Hollande said. Meanwhile, just less than three miles away from the Elysee Paris, police had shut and evacuated Gare de L'Est train station after a bomb threat. The station, one of several main terminals in the French capital, serves cities in eastern Paris and countries to the east. Kerry also visited the Charlie Hedbo offices in Paris, the funeral of its late editor, Stephane Charbonnier, was taking place some 17 miles away. The funeral of Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane 'Charb' Charbonnier also took place this morning . French cartoonist Renald Luzier, aka Luz, juggles with a clementine as he arrives for the funeral in Pontoise, outside Paris . His funeral is one of several taking place today, while more took place yesterday - including the funeral of cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac, 57 . Crowds gathered in Pontoise, north of the French capital, where the cartoonist known as 'Charb' was honoured with speeches and music, including some provided by Irish bagpipes. Two large screens were placed outside St Martin's Hall in Charb's home town, so people could watch what was happening. The cartoonist Philippe Honore, 74, and Mustapha Ourrad, a 60 year-old Charlie Hebdo copy taker, were also set to be buried today.","Contrite Secretary of State arrived in Paris for belated show of unity .

"The obesity crisis in the US could be solved if they lifted the ban on importing haggis, a leading medic has claimed. Former surgeon Lord McColl claimed 24million American Scots were missing out on the delicacy, which 'satisfies hunger very much more than the junk food Americans consume'. But ministers warned the best chance of securing agreement to sell haggis in the US was to get manufacturers to stop including sheep lungs. The House of Lords heard claims that the obesity crisis in the US could be solved if they lifted the ban on importing haggis . The consumption of sheep lung, a key ingredient of haggis alongside heart and liver, has been banned in the US since 1971 and all British lamb has been banned since 1989 following the BSE crisis. The haggis market is already said to be worth £15million in the UK and supporters argue it could be worth far more in the US, given the popularity of Scottish heritage in the country. Lord McColl, a Tory peer, said there could be health benefits for the US if haggis was on the menu. The former professor and director of surgery at Guy's Hospital, London, told peers: 'The United States government is depriving 24 million American Scots of this wholesome food which satisfies hunger very much more than the junk food Americans consume. Lord McColl claimed 24million American Scots were missing out on the delicacy, which 'satisfies hunger very much more than the junk food Americans consume' 'This would help to deal with the greatest epidemic they have - the obesity epidemic, which is killing millions, costing billions of dollars and the cure is free.' However, Lord Winston, a leading fertility doctor and television presenter, hit back, saying that haggis was 'revolting' but if it could be used to curb obesity it should be promoted in Glasgow first. The Labour peer said: 'I confess to being a little bit surprised that one of the most senior qualified medical practitioners in the chamber is asking this question seeing there is a questionable issue about haggis, which I find personally a revolting food. 'Would charity be better at home and if it does really deal with obesity maybe we should be promoting it a little bit in Glasgow?' The Government hopes the ban on British lamb can be lifted as part of a European Union-US trade deal currently being negotiated, which is potentially worth more than £10bn to the British economy overall. Food minister minister Lord de Mauley said there were two obstaclkes to exporting haggis. 'First, the US restrictions on the import of lamb. We are working with the US authorities towards achieving approval to lift those restrictions with I think good prospects,' he said. 'Secondly the US's unwillingness to recognise animal lungs as an acceptable food stuff. In this regard the most promising avenue in the short term is the production of haggis omitting the inclusion of lung and the Scottish government recognises this.' Former environment secretary Owen Paterson had lobbied the US authorities during a visit last summer. Lib Dem Lord Purvis of Tweed urged David Cameron to raise the issue during talks with Barack Obama in the White House today. Lib Dem Lord Purvis of Tweed urged David Cameron to raise the issue during talks with Barack Obama in the White House today . He demanded that 'this ridiculous ban comes to an end', adding: 'If it is not too late, I see that the Prime Minister is with President Obama today, so can my noble friend send an urgent message to make sure that this visit is a triumph by having a private word with the President to make sure that the ban is now lifted' Lord De Mauley replied: 'Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee a rapid resolution of the problem, but I hope I have made clear that we are working extremely hard towards it. Promoting food and drink exports more generally is a key government priority. 'We are working hard to champion UK food and drink overseas with, I think, considerable success.' SNP MP Pete Wishart said: 'If Robert Burns was around today, no doubt he'd brand Lord Winston a 'sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie' for this affront tae a haggis. 'What's really revolting is the millions of pounds of taxpayers' money spent funding the bloated House of Lords year on year which seems to serve little purpose other than to allow unelected peers to insult our national dish.'","Ex-surgeon Lord McColl calls for ban  on exporting to US to be lifted .

"The world’s most powerful investment bank was last night accused of being ‘oblivious’ to public opinion after paying its staff almost a quarter of a million pounds last year on average. Goldman Sachs yesterday cemented its position as the world’s most generous big bank, dishing out £8.4billion in pay and perks for 2014. The Wall Street giant, which employs 6,000 people in London, confirmed its 34,000 staff around the world received an average package of £246,000. Astonishingly, the sum – which is almost ten times the average salary in the UK and dwarfs the Prime Minister’s £142,500 package – represents a small pay cut. Goldman Sachs confirmed its 34,000 staff around the world received an average package of £246,000. File photo . Staff received £248,000 on average in 2013. The figure includes salary, bonuses and benefits, including healthcare and pensions. The announcement came as Goldman revealed its profits rose 5pc last year to £5.6billion. Goldman is set to confirm multi million pound bonuses for top executives, including boss Lloyd Blankfein and UK supremo Michael Sherwood, in separate filings to US regulators next week. Deborah Hargreaves, boss of campaign group the High Pay Centre said: ‘This is a further sign that the banking industry - and particularly Goldman Sachs - is completely oblivious to public opinion about bonuses and believes the only way to reward employees is through money.’ Banks on both sides of the Atlantic have been criticised for continuing to award eye watering sums to its staff, despite evidence that the bonus culture encouraged the reckless behaviour which helped to trigger the financial crisis. But Goldman has earned itself the nickname ‘Goldmine Sacks’ for consistently paying more than its rivals as it has consolidated its position as the most powerful investment bank in the world. Just before New Year it sneaked out details of a £367million pay bonanza for its top London staff for 2013. The huge sum was shared between 121 Goldman Sachs bosses and traders, at an average of £3million a head. Astonishingly, the sum represents a small pay cut as the average package was £248,000 in 2012. Pictured, the Goldman Sachs Group global headquarters In New York . This equated to almost £60,000 a week, more than 120 times the average wage. The average pay package of £246,000 for all staff last year dwarfs those on offer at Goldman’s rivals. On Wednesday JP Morgan - which employs 11,000 people in the UK,. became the first US bank to publish its annual figures for last year. It paid £135,000 on average to its 51,129 investment bankers. Goldman Sachs insists it has been showing more restraint since the financial crisis. Last year, staff pocketed just under 37 pc of its earnings – before the crisis it routinely paid out more than 40pc. Its chief executive Lloyd Blankfein - who once claimed that banks ‘do God’s work’ - has also seen his pay cut. His £14million pay package is a far cry from the £45million he was awarded before the financial crisis set in in 2007. The UK banks are set to announce their pay and bonuses for last year in the coming weeks, but they are likely to be much smaller on average than those awarded at Goldman. But Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio is in line for a £7million windfall after hitting a number of performance targets, including returning the bank to profit and helping to push up its share price. This award, which dates back to 2011, will come on top of his £4million pay package for 2014. Labour have pledged to reintroduce a tax on bankers’ bonuses if they win the general election in May.","Investment bank was accused of being ‘oblivious’ to public opinion .

"The Catholic archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis in Minnesota has filed for bankruptcy protection  in wake of huge sex abuse claims. Up to 300 estimated claimants have lodged complaints against church employees in the area with the majority of cases dating from the 1950s to the 1980s. The total amount owed to victims tops $100 million according to the Associated Press, however the church has declared assets totaling ten to fifty million dollars. The lawsuits will be put on hold while the bankruptcy issues are resolved, giving religious leaders time to react accordingly. Scroll down for video . Testing times: In a letter to parishioners, St. Paul and Minneapolis Archbishop John Nienstedt (pictured) said he ordered the bankruptcy as the fairest way to distribute the archdiocese's finite resources to victims . The archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis posted a message to its website today stating: 'We must all come together to care for those who have been hurt during this tragic time in our church’s history. 'By filing for [bankruptcy], we are not avoiding our responsibilities, but recognizing them.' St. Paul attorney Jeff Anderson suggested on Friday that the bankruptcy process could take about two years. The Catholic archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis connects 188 parishes, 91 schools and 825,000 members and a handful of charities. It is the 12th U.S. diocese - out of around 200 nationwide - to seek such action in the face of sex abuse claims. An attorney for the St. Paul and Minneapolis victims, Mike Finnegan, said the bankruptcy filing won't stop scrutiny of the archdiocese. But church officials have 'promised to treat victims fairly during this process,' said Finnegan, whose firm is working with the archdiocese as part of an October settlement on child protection issues. But Patrick Noaker, another victims' attorney, said he's disappointed. Noaker is handling a lawsuit scheduled for trial this month, and he said the bankruptcy filing robs him of the chance to reveal information that could help protect children in the future. 'The process of bankruptcy is not going to make kids safer,' he said. 'I don't think it's any accident that they filed a week before this trial was going to start.' In a letter to parishioners, Archbishop John Nienstedt said he ordered the bankruptcy as the fairest way to distribute the archdiocese's finite resources to victims. 'This is not an attempt to silence victims or deny them justice in court,' Nienstedt wrote. Minnesota lawmakers created a three-year window in 2013 for victims of past sexual abuse to file claims that otherwise would have been barred by the statute of limitations. Since then, the archdiocese has been sued roughly two dozen times, and it has received more than 100 notices of potential claims, according to Joe Kueppers, the archdiocese's chancellor for civil affairs. The mission of the church and its day-to-day operations will continue through bankruptcy, archdiocese attorney Charlie Rogers said. Parishes and schools, which are incorporated separately from the archdiocese's central office, should not be affected. 'It's a smart move on their part,' Pamela Foohey, an associate professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law, said of the bankruptcy filing. 'It ultimately can be useful for the victims taken as a whole, assuming that the diocese treats them fairly.' Not all bankruptcy filings have gone smoothly. The Archdiocese of Milwaukee's bankruptcy has dragged on for four years as attorneys fight over who should get paid and how much. But in Montana, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena sought protection only after working out a deal with victims. The deal was approved by a judge earlier this week. The St. Paul and Minneapolis archdiocese does not have a pre-packaged plan for reorganization, but the archdiocese will try to avoid prolonged fights seen in other dioceses, Rogers said. The archdiocese has already addressed issues that have bogged down other bankruptcies, including implementing a new system to protect children and disclosing thousands of pages of church documents and the names of accused priests. As a result, Rogers said, this bankruptcy could focus purely on financial restitution to victims. Finnegan, the victims' attorney, said the process also will allow victims to look at the church's finances, and allow the archdiocese and victims to pursue insurance companies. Lachowitzer said he hopes parishioners see the bankruptcy filing as a necessary step to close 'a horrendous and tragic chapter in the life of the church.'","Up to 300 estimated claimants have lodged complaints against church employees in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul archdiocese .

"A pensioner who says local children made his life 'hell' put anti-vandal paint on his garden fence to stop them climbing on it and throwing stones at his windows. Robert Brown also reported the youngsters to police and was delighted when officers came round to speak to him. He assumed it was to take details of his plight – and was shocked to learn he was being prosecuted for criminal damage because the children had got the paint over their clothes. Their mother alleged that almost £4,000 worth of furniture and carpets had been ruined by the youngsters treading the paint, which does not dry and leaves surfaces slippery, into her house. Robert Brown, 76, (pictured) says children made his life 'hell' so put anti-vandal paint on his garden fence . Unemployed mother-of-six Judith Ripley-Aitchison complained about the vandal paint and said 'kids are kids' Retired security guard Mr Brown, 76, was hauled to court three times and threatened with a criminal record in a nine-month ordeal as he fought the case which cost around £10,000 of taxpayers' cash. It was dropped on the day it was due to go to trial last month. Last night Mr Brown, a divorced father of one, criticised the police and Crown Prosecution Service. 'We are always hearing that the police don't have enough funds, but how much money has been wasted chasing a prosecution like this?' he said. 'I'd had months of harassment, of these children making my life hell, and decided to do something about it. An Englishman's home is still his castle and I was just protecting the home where I've lived for 50 years.' Mr Brown said: 'An Englishman's home is still his castle and I was protecting the home I've lived for 50 years' Mr Brown's ordeal began last March when he says he caught several children, who live in a council house behind his property in Hindley Green, near Wigan, throwing stones at his windows after using his fence to climb on to the roof of a council outhouse overlooking his back garden. He bought some anti-vandal, or anti-climb, paint and put it in two-inch wide strips across the top edge of his fence and the outhouse roof, and warned the youngsters not to touch it. Police visited him after their mother, Judith Ripley-Aitchison, 44, complained that her children had traipsed through her home covered in the paint, causing £3,750 worth of damage. She denied Mr Brown had warned the youngsters about the paint or that they had climbed on to the roof and fence to get it on their clothes, saying it had 'dripped on to them'. Mr Brown was charged with criminal damage and asked to go to Leigh police station to accept a caution, but refused. Instead he fought the case which was thrown out after prosecutors admitted there was 'no realistic prospect of conviction'. Mrs Ripley-Aitchison said her children had gone through her home in paint, causing £3,750 worth of damage . Last night unemployed Mrs Ripley-Aitchison, a single mother-of-six, denied her children made Mr Brown's life a misery. 'I had four children running inside covered, it [the paint] went on the carpets, on curtains, everywhere,' said Mrs Ripley-Aitchison, whose children are educated at home. 'They thought they had found some kind of black mud, they were playing with it. 'The kids may have thrown a ball and a hula hoop over once, but kids are kids. He [Mr Brown] is the type who would complain if a bird pooed in his garden.' The Crown Prosecution Service said it had offered no evidence after a review on the day of the proposed trial. Sergeant Dave Clarke, of Greater Manchester police, said the case was part of a 'much bigger' neighbour issue and they had a duty to investigate Mrs Ripley-Aitchison's complaint. 'We attempted to resolve the issue by a police caution. As this was refused, he was issued with a summons authorised by the CPS.'","Robert Brown, 76, says children climbed on garden fence and threw stones .

"Olympic gold medal-winning snowboarder Kaitlyn Farrington has revealed that she is retiring after being diagnosed with a degenerative spine condition. The 25-year-old athlete, who won gold for the halfpipe at the Olympic Games in Sochi last February, made the announcement on her Instagram page. 'The past few months have been really difficult,' she wrote. 'I've met with many specialists and they all confirmed I have congenital cervical stenosis of my spine, a condition I was born with and never knew I had until a recent fall in Austria led me to get an MRI. Scroll down for video . Life changing: Kaitlyn Farrington, pictured in February 2014 with her Olympic gold medal for the halfpipe, has announced she is retiring from snowboarding because she has a degenerative spine condition . 'It's taken me these few months to come to terms with my diagnosis and the fact that I must retire from competitive halfpipe snowboarding. 'I am so thankful for my friends, family and sponsors for their support throughout this time. It's been an unbelievable run and I look forward to my next quarter century. Cheers to early retirement.' Speaking with ESPN, she revealed that after taking a fall from a jump in Austria in late October, she was unable to feel any part of her body and could not move for two minutes. 'It was hard to comprehend what was happening,' she said. Eventually the movement came back but, still troubled by a pain on her neck after returning home to Salt Lake City, she went to a spine doctor, who told her she would never snowboard again. 'I wasn't ready to hear it,' she said. 'It was the worst conversation of my life.' She met with other specialists, who all repeated the diagnosis, leaving her angry and wishing she hadn't found out. She kept the truth from her loved ones. Trouble: U.S. Snowboard team physician Dr. Tom Hackett shows her MRI and points to the kink in her spinal cord that would put her at risk of paralysis if she continued to compete in snowboarding . 'I think by lying, I convinced myself it wasn't happening,' she said. 'I couldn't accept it yet.' But the day before her 25th birthday, she met with U.S. Snowboard team physician Tom Hackett, who had been her doctor since she was a child, and he told her the same thing: she had been born with a narrowing of her spine in her neck that could leave her unable to walk if she took a fall. 'There is no room to allow for any movement of the spinal cord when the spine flexes and bends, to prevent the cord from getting kinked or pinched,' he told ESPN. 'In Kaitlyn's spine, there is no room for error. It's only by the grace of God that nothing worse happened before this injury.' If she continued to snowboard and took another fall, she could be paralyzed. He said his heart sank when he saw her MRI because: 'I knew it was over.' Slowly she started breaking the news to loved ones and there were more tears, she said. Winner: Farrington, pictured competing at Sochi, said at first she refused to accept the diagnosis . Joy: She is pictured center at Sochi last year with bronze medallist, Kelly Clark (left) from the U.S., and silver medallist, Australia's Torah Bright. She said she is grateful she did not learn about the condition earlier . But she is now coming to terms with the diagnosis, and is thankful that she did not learn about it too early - when she would have missed out on a snowboarding career - or too late. 'I can walk. I can still snowboard,' she told ESPN. 'I just have to keep my feet on the ground. I still want to be a professional snowboarder, I just have to figure out what that means.' Farrington unexpectedly won gold in Sochi last February, beating tough competition from the previous three Olympic champions, Torah Bright, Kelly Clark and Hannah Teter. 'The next quarter of my life is going to be extremely different from the first. I have to figure out how to make it just as great.'","Farrington, who won gold in the women's halfpipe at Sochi last year, made the announcement on her Instagram page on Thursday .

"An internet blogger facing 1,000 lashes for criticising clerics in Saudi Arabia was given new hope last night after the apparent intervention of the king. Bowing to massive international pressure, King Abdullah has referred the case of Raif Badawi to the country's supreme court. There has been no official statement from the Saudi government on the monarch's intervention, revealed by Mr Badawi's wife, Ensaf. Scroll down for video . Father of three Raif Badawi faces 50 lashings every Friday for the next 18 weeks for 'insulting Islam' Mr Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, fled to Canada with their children. She says he started a forum that was meant to encourage discussion of the Muslim faith. After seeing the video, she said: 'Every lash killed me' Earlier yesterday Saudi Arabia was accused of 'outrageous inhumanity' after it delayed the father of three's flogging sentence…so his wounds could heal before he was whipped again. Mr Badawi, 31, has won support from governments and human rights groups around the world after he was sentenced to ten years in prison, a £177,000 fine and the lashes. His official crime was to insult Islam but supporters say his real offence was to criticise the country's powerful Sunni clerics on his blog. He faces 50 lashings every Friday for the next 18 weeks. Amnesty, which has adopted Mr Badawi as a prisoner of conscience, said he was taken out of his cell in Jeddah yesterday and examined by a doctor who decided that the wounds from his first set of 50 lashes last week had not healed. He recommended the next round of lashes be delayed to next week. Leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone is believed to show the first flogging session, as a shackled and standing Mr Badawi is hit on his legs and back by a policeman with a switch.

'Not only does this postponement expose the utter brutality of this punishment, it underlines its outrageous inhumanity,' said Amnesty's Said Boumedouha. 'The notion that Raif Badawi must be allowed to heal so that he can suffer this cruel punishment again and again is macabre and outrageous.' UN officials say the flogging breaches international law as a 'cruel and unusual punishment'. The Foreign Office says it will continue to raise the case. Ensaf - pictured here, centre, campaigning for his release on Tuesday - fears each week, the floggings will kill Raif a little more .

"A boy whose tale of dying and going to heaven after a car crash that became a best-selling book has admitted to making the whole thing up. Alex Malarkey, now 16, lay in a coma for two months and was left paralyzed after the wreck in 2004, but when he awoke, he amazed doctors and his parents with a story of how an angel had lifted him up to heaven where he met Jesus and Satan. His story was made into the best-selling book The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, which was co-authored with his father Kevin and first published in 2010. But now Alex has claimed it was all a lie. Scroll down for video . Lie: Alex Malarkey says he made up his account of ascending to heaven which was made into a best-selling book after he was in a car crash at the age of six with his father in 2004. He is pictured last year . Divorce: Alex co-wrote the book with his father, pictured. He is now divorced from his mother and lives separately from his son . In an open letter shared by his mother, he says he concocted the tale in an attempt to attract attention  - and is now criticizing publishers who continue to make large profits from the book. His mother, who is recently separated from his father and the author of the book, says Alex does not receive any money from the novel, which made the New York Times Bestsellers List. In an open letter addressed to 'Sellers, buyers and marketers' of his book, Alex wrote: 'I did not die. I did not go to heaven.' 'I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention. When I made the claims that I did, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to.' Many Christian publishers are now announcing that they will stop selling the book. The book is one of three 'real-life' tales of paradise on sale at Christian book stores - 90 Minutes in Heaven and Heaven is for Real are the others. Alex is still severely disabled and is cared for by his mother at home in Ohio. They live together in Huntsville with his three siblings. Kevin Malarkey lives in Columbus, Ohio. Long before Alex made his statement, Beth Malarkey has previously suggested that the book was made up and insists that the family receives no money from its sale. She  wrote on her blog in April last year: 'There are many who are scamming and using the Word of God to do it.' The book describes heaven thus: . 'When I arrived in heaven, I was inside the gate. The gate was really tall, and it was white. It was very shiny, and it looked like it had scales like a fish. I was in the inner heaven and everything was brighter and more intense on the inside of the gate. It was perfect. Perfect is my favorite word for describing heaven.' Alex also describes in the book how he floated above the scene of his crash and talked to Jesus while firefighters extricated his body from the wreckage. Controversial tale: In the letter, Alex criticizes publishers who profit from his book. His mother, left, says the family does not receive any money from the sales. He is now 16. Home life: Alex is able to stand with the help of a brace and has been taken on runs by his mother, right . 'It is both puzzling and painful to watch the book The Boy who Came Back from Heaven to not only continue to sell, but to continue, for the most part, to not be questioned. She insists that her son 'has not received monies from the book nor have a majority of his needs been funded by it.' And she adds that Alex previously told a pastor that the book was made up, but was told the publication was 'blessing' people and to stay quiet. She concludes: 'The ones making money from the book are NOT the ones staying up through the night, struggling for their breath, or were they the ones at six years old, waking up unable to move or breathe and in a strange place after last remember seeing a car coming right at the car he was riding in'. Alex's letter continues his attack on Christian booksellers . He wrties: 'They should read the Bible, which is enough. The Bible is the only source of truth. Anything written by man cannot be infallible.' Home life: Alex, pictured before the accident, has been recovering for years after the crash and is still cared for by his family at home . Steelers fan: Alex writes that 'People have profited from lies, and continue to' in the open letter about his book . In the letter, which features on the Pulpit and Pen website, Malarkey went on to say: 'It is only through repentance of your sins and a belief in Jesus as the Son of God, who died for your sins (even though he committed none of his own) so that you can be forgiven may you learn of Heaven outside of what is written in the Bible…not by reading a work of man. Malarkey said he wrote the book because he thought it would get him 'attention'; it became a best seller . 'I want the whole world to know that the Bible is sufficient. Those who market these materials must be called to repent and hold the Bible as enough.' The book, which features the description 'Miracles, Angels, and Life beyond This World', has been a popular read in Christian book stores and had a 4.3 rating on Amazon. It became part of a popular genre of books known as 'heavenly tourism'. Another young boy's tale of going to heaven, Colton Burpo from Nebraska has recently been made into the movie Heaven is For Real. The publishers description on the book reads: 'In 2004, Kevin Malarkey and his six-year-old son, Alex, suffered an horrific car accident. The impact from the crash paralyzed Alex–and medically speaking, it was unlikely that he could survive. 'I think Alex has gone to be with Jesus,' a friend told the stricken dad. 'But two months later, Alex awoke from a coma with an incredible story to share. Of events at the accident scene and in the hospital while he was unconscious. Of the angels that took him through the gates of heaven itself. Of the unearthly music that sounded just 'terrible' to a six-year-old. And, most amazing of all . . . Of meeting and talking to Jesus. 'The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven' is the true story of an ordinary boy's most extraordinary journey. As you see heaven and earth through Alex's eyes, you'll come away with new insights on miracles, life beyond this world, and the power of a father's love.' One of the book's stockists, The Lifeway Christian Bookstore, told the website it plans to remove the book from its shelves and send back its current stock. In a statement, its director of communications, Martin King, said:  'LifeWay was informed this week that Alex Malarkey has retracted his testimony about visiting heaven as told in the book 'The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven.' Therefore, we are returning to the publisher the few copies we have in our Stores.'","Alex Malarkey said he visited heaven and met Jesus while in a coma for two months at age six following a car crash in 2004 .

"California health officials on Thursday confirmed 13 new measles cases connected to an outbreak at Disney theme parks last month, bringing the total number of illnesses to 39 of whom many were not vaccinated. The new cases of the airborne illness include five in Los Angeles County and one in San Diego County. The San Diego County cases include at least five people who showed up with fevers and rashes Wednesday at the Sharp-Rees-Steely Urgent Care Clinic in the suburb of La Mesa. New cases of measles: California health officials on Thursday confirmed 13 new measles cases connected to an outbreak at Disney theme parks last month, bringing the total number of illnesses to 39 . The clinic was shut down for several hours and dozens of other patients at the clinic were questioned about their medical histories, officials said. Craig Sturak with the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency said Thursday that the public may have been exposed at that clinic and eight other places including drugstores, grocery stores and gyms. Officials said 35 of the confirmed cases are in California, two are in Utah and one apiece in Colorado and Washington. Many were not vaccinated against the disease. Of the 10 total cases in San Diego, only one patient had been vaccinated, Sturak said. Exact figures were not immediately available for other areas. Most of the patients visited Disneyland or Disney California Adventure between December 15 and December 20, but some contracted the illness from others who visited. Disney officials have said they are working with public health authorities to provide any necessary assistance. Measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Health experts say the best prevention against measles is vaccination. While officials declared measles eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 because of a lack of continuous transmission, the illness is still brought into the country by foreign visitors or unvaccinated Americans. Not vaccinated: Many of the 39 people who fell ill from measles at Disney theme parks were not vaccinated .","California health officials on Thursday confirmed 13 new measles cases connected to an outbreak at Disney theme parks last month .

"Victor Paul Alvarez was fired from Boston.com for the story he wrote that has been dubbed 'tasteless, mean-spirited and humorless in one fell swoop' A reporter  has been fired after penning a tasteless story about a death threat made against Speaker John Boehner. Victor Paul Alvarez, an associate editor at Boston.com, wrote a story on Tuesday night headlined: 'Would anyone have noticed if bartender succeeded in poisoning John Boehner?' The article suggested that House Speaker Boehner has a drinking problem, and then claimed that his ‘pickled liver’ could have ‘filtered out the toxins’ from an attempt to poison him. A former bartender at an Ohio country club is currently charged with threatening to kill Boehner with a gun or by poisoning his drink. Alvarez said in an email to the Associated Press that he was fired on Thursday. He also said he apologized to his bosses for the ‘terrible mistake’. On Twitter, Alvarez’s bio now reads: ‘My last boss said - It’s very difficult to hit the epicenter of tasteless, mean-spirited and humorless in one fell swoop - He's right. I'm to blame. No excuse.’ That quote reportedly comes from Mike Sheehan, chief executive of Boston.com's owner, Boston Globe Media Partners. Sheehan sent an apology to Boehner's office. Alvarez also took time to answer critics on Twitter and make a statement that read: 'Ordered silent yesterday. Now I can comment: The story I wrote was awful. Tasteless. Mean. Bosses felt it was inexcusable. They fired me.' Boston.com general manager Corey Gottlieb said it was posted without a top editor's review. Gottlieb said the site doesn't comment on personnel matters. The article has been rewritten under the headline 'Bartender’s Threat Against John Boehner Thwarted' and now includes an apology from Gottlieb and an Editor’s note. A day after he was fired, Alvarez responded to some of his critics on Twitter and made a short statement accepting responsibility for the 'tasteless' and 'mean' story . The apology reads: . 'Last night, an opinion piece was published on Boston.com that has since been adjusted to what you’ll see below. The original column made references to Speaker Boehner that were off-color and completely inappropriate.

The Editor’s note states: ‘A previous version of this article made an unsubstantiated reference to the health of Speaker Boehner.’ The Boston Globe coverage of the story says that while Boston.com is owned by Boston Globe Media Partners LLC, it operates independently from The Boston Globe and BostonGlobe.com, with separate editorial leadership. A Boehner spokesman called Alvarez's story ‘insensitive and inappropriate’. Speaker Boehner was threatened by Michael Hoyt, a former bartender at the Wetherington Country Club in Ohio (pictured) that is patronized by Boehner. Hoyt was fired in October and believed the congressman was to blame . The threat to Speaker Boehner that was the subject of the original article came from 44-year-old Michael Hoyt, a former bartender at the Wetherington Country Club patronized by Boehner. Hoyt has been charged with threatening to murder the 12-term congressman by poisoning his wine. According to federal prosecutors, the failed assassination plot was hatched after Hoyt was fired from the club. Which he believed was the fault of Speaker Boehner. When questioned by the authorities, Hoyt reportedly said evil voices coming from his car speakers and his radio at home told him the House speaker was the devil. In his rantings to police, Hoyt allegedly blamed the Ohio Republican for spreading Ebola and said he had been planning to shoot Boehner with his Beretta .380 automatic. The alleged plot on the politician’s life came to light October 29 when Mr Hoyt called 911 to complain that John Boehner allegedly got him fired a week earlier. When officers responded to Hoyt's home, the bartender told them he regretted he 'did not have time to put something in John Boehner's drink' during the five years he had spent serving him wine at the country club. Michael Hoyt (pictured left) claimed that he was Jesus Christ and that Boehner (pictured right) had been mean to him and was responsible for Ebola. He threatened to poison the Speaker's wine at the country club . Hoyt claimed that he was Jesus Christ and that Boehner had been mean to him and was responsible for Ebola. He also wrote a rambling email to Boehner’s wife Debbie about his firing from the country club, and was convinced that evil people were coming to 'chop him up' – a fear that prompted him to call the police. Hoyt volunteered to be taken to a psychiatric hospital, and his loaded weapon was confiscated. Hoyt's arrest comes less than a year after two other men were charged with threatening John Boehner’s life. Brandon Thompson, 32, of Indiana, was arrested May 9 for making threats against Speaker Boehner, just days before Ronald Frazier, of Arizona, tweeted about wanting to kill the Republican politician.","Boston.com reporter Victor Paul Alvarez was fired for writing a story asking if anyone would have noticed if John Boehner had been poisoned .

"A convicted baby killer in Oklahoma screamed 'my body is on fire' as he violently twitched in his death chamber during his execution in Oklahoma on Thursday. This is ten months after Oklahoma made headlines for 'inhumane execution practices' for the 43-minute botched killing of inmate Clayton Lockett who writhed and moaned in the gurney, suffering a heart attack when the injection of midazolam, vecuronium bromide, and potassium chloride failed to kill him swiftly. Charles Frederick Warner's execution for the 1997 killing of 11-month-old girl Adrianna Waller in Oklahoma City lasted 18 minutes. Prison officials declared him dead at 7.28pm CST. Scroll down for videos . Charles Warner (left) was executed today in Oklahoma for the rape and murder of a baby girl . Warner was executed for killing 11-month-old Adrianna Waller in 1997 . The New York Daily News reports that Warner's execution at Oklahoma State Penitentiary comes after they went before the Supreme Court following the botched execution and spend $71,000 on 'upgrades.' Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she believes the effectiveness of the drugs should be called into question because Oklahoma's execution method is scientifically untested. This was a dissenting opinion in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling saying they wouldn’t consider whether or not the sedative given to the inmate would be strong enough to make him unconscious so he could not feel himself die. 'Petitioners have committed horrific crimes and should be punished but the eight amendment guarantees that no one should be subjected to an execution that causes searing, unnecessary pain before death' Sotomayer wrote. Oklahoma's last execution saw murderer Clayton Lockett writhe and moan in the gurney after he was declared unconscious . The same three-drug method used on Lockett, involving sedative midazolam, was used on Warner . Warner's execution was scheduled on April 29, the same night Lockett was put to death but was postponed to Thursday of 2015. Warner's attorney Madeline Cohen said there is no way to know whether or not Warner suffered because of the paralytic drug he was also given that prevented him from moving. 'Because Oklahoma injected Mr. Warner with a paralytic tonight, acting as a chemical veil, we will never know whether he experienced the intense pain of suffocation and burning that would result from injecting a conscious person with rocuronium bromide and potassium chloride,' Cohen said in a statement. Warner made a statement before he was executed. 'Before I give my final statement, I'll tell you they poked me five times. It hurt. It feels like acid, ‘Warner said before his execution began. He added, 'I'm not a monster. I didn't do everything they said I did.' After the first drug, the sedative midazolam, was administered and a microphone inside the death chamber was turned off, Warner said, ""My body is on fire.' But he showed no obvious signs of distress. Clayton Lockett moaned and tried to lift his head, prompting officials to try to halt the execution before he died in apparent agony . Witnesses said they saw slight twitching in Warner's neck about three minutes after the lethal injection started. The twitching lasted about seven minutes until he stopped breathing. Gov. Mary Fallin issued a statement praising the professionalism of the prison staff. 'Justice was served tonight as the state executed Charles Warner for the heinous crime of raping and murdering an infant,' Fallin said. Midazolam has been challenged in court as ineffective in rendering a person properly unconscious before the second and third drugs are administered, creating a risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering. Attorneys for Oklahoma say a failed intravenous line and a lack of training led to the problems with Lockett's injection, not the drugs. Warner and three other death row inmates  filed a petition with the Supreme Court, calling for their executions to be called off. Warner was not granted such a luxury. The appeal states: 'There is a well-established scientific consensus that [midazolam] cannot maintain a deep, comalike unconsciousness.' Oklahoma has increased the amount of midazolam to be used by five times to mirror the recipe used in 11 successful executions in Florida. But the drug was used in other botched executions in Arizona and Ohio last year, where inmates snorted and gasped after lethal injections. Oklahoma has ordered new medical equipment such as backup IV lines and an ultrasound machine for finding veins and has renovated the execution chamber with new audio and video equipment to help the execution team spot potential problems. Last year Shonda Waller, the mother of the raped and murdered baby, told KFOR that she did not want Warner to be executed. She said: 'I don’t want to see him to be sentenced to death. 'If they truly want to honor me then they will do away with the death penalty for him and they will give him life in prison without the possibility of parole because that’s the only thing that’s going to honor me. 'I don’t see any justice in just sentencing someone to die. 'To me, the justice is in someone living with what they have done to you to your family, and having to live with that the rest of their life knowing they will never get to walk out those doors.'","Charles Frederick Warner's execution for the 1997 killing of an 11-month-old girl in Oklahoma City lasted 18 minutes today .

"Endless photographs have been taken of Sydney's iconic Opera House and Bondi Beach over the years - but none like this. What started out as a passionate hobby for Pete Davies a year ago has been so successful that he has plans to eventually throw in his tech job to concentrate on taking the stunning images using a drone and a GoPro on a full time basis.

"Twelve people have been arrested in connection with terrorism around Paris today following a night of violence in nearby Belgium which saw two suspected Jihadis killed. Meanwhile, German police also carried out raids on 11 properties, arresting two people suspected of having links to radical Islamists. Operations by police commandos across northern Europe saw the forces of law and order raid cells allegedly linked to Al Qaeda and IS. It was in the town of Verviers, near Belgium's border with Germany, that the two suspects died in a fire fight on Thursday evening. They were suspected of planning a 'Belgium Charlie Hebdo' – a reference to the attack on the satirical magazine in the French capital last week in which 12 died. German police arrested two suspected Islamists in Berlin, hours after two people were killed in a firefight with Belgian police . The Belgian police - pictured - had swooped on the two suspects, believed to be planning their own 'Charlie Hebdo' attack . As police investigated links between the armed Islamist fanatics in both countries, twelve were placed in custody in the Paris area. 'Coordinated raids took place across the area, with suspects arrested at a number of addresses, and potential evidence seized,' said a police source. Six of those in custody are linked to the Amedy Coulibaly, the 32-year-old IS-linked terrorist who killed four Jewish people at a Kosher deli in the city a week ago today, before being gunned down himself. 'All those arrested have links with arms and drug trafficking,' said a judicial source close to the enquiry. He added: 'In this case they are linked with the supply of weapons and vehicles to the killers, as well as to other logistical support.' The arrests carried out overnight were 'mainly in the Paris suburbs', and especially in Chatenay-Malabry, Epinay and Montrouge. It is thought the 12 Paris suspects are being quizzed over any link to 'logistical support' they gave the gunmen - pictured here . That could include the guns and ammunition used during the three days of terror on Paris's streets. Pictured: emergency services at the scene of the Charlie Hebdo massacre . It was in the latter southern suburb that Coulibaly shot an unarmed policewoman dead last Thursday. DNA tests and telephone interceptions have all been used to try and find those who were connected to the original Paris attacks, which saw 17 victims killed in total. Automatic weapons and a rocket launcher used in the Charlie Hebdo and Kosher supermarket were purchased from Belgian gangs, police believe. The Scorpion machine gun and the Tokarev handgun used by Coulibaly during his attack on the Jewish deli came from Brussels and Charleroi. Fritz-Joly Joachin - who is said to have been in contact with Cherif Kouachi - arriving in court in Bulgaria, where a final decision on whether he will be deported back to France will be made . A Bulgarian court is set to make a final decision on whether to extradite a French citizen who had allegedly been in contact several times with one of the Charlie Hebdo massacre brothers. Fritz-Joly Joachin appeared in court in the southern city of Haskovo this morning. He had been detained by Bulgarian police at a border checkpoint as he tried to cross into Turkey in the early hours of January 1 under a European arrest warrant which alleged he had abducted his three-year-old son - an accusation he denies. Joachin had been travelling by bus from France to Turkey with his son, but was arrested after his wife told French authorities he planned to take their child to Syria to be raised under radical Islam. He denies this, claiming he was just going on holiday with his son and girlfriend in Turkey. A second European arrest warrant alleges the 29-year-old had participated in a criminal group which plotted acts of terrorism, said Darina Slavova, a prosecutor in the town of Haskovo. The warrant also alleges Joachin, who is of Haitian origin, had 'several contacts' with Cherif Kouachi, who slaughtered 12 people in the Charlie Hebdo offices last week with his brother Said. It was not clear how the alleged contact took place, but it is understood to have happened last year. Joachin's Bulgarian lawyer Radi Radev said his client denied any links to terrorism and had told a judge on Tuesday: 'I have friends but if they have committed crimes I cannot be held responsible for that.' Speaking to a judge in a Haskovo court on Monday, Joachin agreed to be sent back to France, and the court will make a ruling on the extradition on Friday. And the Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers used by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, 34 and 32, to attack Charlie Hebdo were purchased near the Midi station, in Brussels for less than £4000. Those killed during the 10-minute gun battle in Belgium had recently returned from Syria, and were preparing 'terrorist attacks on a grand scale', said federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt. John Kerry, the US Secretary of State, arrived in Paris today, following fierce criticism at the absence of an American representative at last Sunday's mass march in support of Charlie Hebdo. It came as some 200 friends and family prepared to attend the funeral of Stephane Charbonnier, the 47-year-old editor of Charlie Hebdo, who was better known as the cartoonist 'Charb', in the Paris suburb of Pontoise.","Police carried out raids in five areas of Paris while conducting arrests .

It’s simple, not overdone.’ Even Gwyneth admits she's got in wrong at times. On her lifestyle website Goop, she wrote that 'two that come to mind' are 'looks I wore to the Oscars in 2000 and 2002.' She explained: 'The first is the Calvin Klein. It's an okay dress but not Oscars material. I chose it because I wanted to disappear that year. Also, the goth Alexander McQueen I wore a few years later. 'There were a few issues; I still love the dress itself but I should have worn a bra and I should have just had simple beachy hair and less makeup. Then, it would have worked as I wanted it to - a little bit of punk at the Oscars.' Here, we reveal some of the Oscar winner's worst looks. Too revealing: Gwyneth admitted this sheer panelled Antonio Berardi gown worn to the Iron Man 3 premiere in 2013 was a 'disaster' because it couldn't be worn with knickers.

"President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron told a packed house of reporters Friday that Congress should hold off on legislation that would impose tough new sanctions on Iran as talks about that nation's nuclear ambitions continue. 'My message to Congress is ""Just hold your fire"",' Obama said during a rare joint White House press conference, insisting that he can easily fall back on a new sanctions regime if talks fail. 'That's not a difficult vote for me to get through Congress,' he said, asking for 'a few months' to avert a larger crisis. Cameron acknowledged that he has been active in lobbying U.S. senators, urging them to consider taking a wait-and-see approach. 'Yes, I have contacted a couple of senators this morning and I may speak to one or two more this afternoon,' he said, while cautioning that he was not calling 'as British prime minister to tell the American Senate what they should or shouldn't do. That wouldn't be right.' Scroll down for video . UNITED: US President Barack Obama (right) and Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron (left) held a press conference in the East Room of the White House on Friday and insisted that the threat of new Iran sanctions could torpedo a nuclear agreement . Cameron acknowledged that he had taken the unusual step of directly lobbying members of the US Senate to keep their powder dry and back off from new sanctions threats while negotiations proceed . But he said he had communicated 'that it's the opinion of the United Kingdom that further sanctions – or further threat of sanctions at this point – won't actually help to bring the talks to a successful conclusion.' 'And they could fracture the international unity that there's been, which has been so valuable in presenting a united front to Iran.' 'We should not impose further sanctions now,' Cameron had already said during his opening statement, in a clear shot across Congress's bow. Iran has maintained that it's only developing nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes but Europe and the U.S. are skeptical – and determined not to let the Islamic republic's mullahs take possession of a nuclear weapon that could target Israel or other countries. A press aide to Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, one of the two lawmakers most visible in crafting a new sanctions proposal, said a call with Cameron had been scheduled for Friday but never took place. But Kirk said in a statement that 'Iran sanctions were signed into law four times with bipartisan, veto-proof majorities in the Senate and the House.' 'If anything can stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons, it is maintaining the united bipartisan front in Congress to end Iran’s uranium enrichment and plutonium paths to the bomb. Now is the time to stand united against Iran’s nuclear threat, not to divide into partisan corners.' A spokesperson for Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Kirk's counterpart on the bipartisan measure, did not respond to a request for comment about whether he had spoken with Cameron. But Menendez vowed on Friday to push ahead with his bill. 'All I'm saying,' he declared during a press conference in New Jersey, 'is let us put in prospective sanctions that don't get imposed, don't get imposed, until July.' Menendez said he has a 'fundamental disagreement' with the Obama administration. Cameron defended his tactics on Friday, along with the current level of pressure the West has put on Iran. BUDDIES: Obama calls Cameron 'bro,' it has emerged in recent days, and they expressed mutual admiration during Friday's press conference; the two are shown Thursday in the Oval Office of the White House . 'I think the big picture is very clear,' he said: Sanctions that America and the European Union  put in place have had an effect. That has led to pressure, that pressure has led to talks, adn those talks at least have a prospect of success.' 'I would argue with the president: How much better is that than the other potential outcomes.' 'Congress needs to show patience,' Obama agreed. 'WIth respect to the veto ... I will veto a bill that comes to my desk. And I will make this argument to the American people as to why I'm doing so.' 'Under the interim deal that brought Iran to the table, we were not supposed to initiate new sanctions.' He dismissed the argument that the latest congressional legislative language doesn't impose new economic penalties on Iran, but merely promises them if talks fail. 'I assure you that is not how Iran would interpret it, or our partners would interpret it. So the likelihood of the entire negotiations collapsing is very high. And if that happens, there is no constraint on Iran at that point going back and doing exactly what it had been doing before they came to the table: developing a heavy-water reactor that, once built, is extraordinarily difficult to dismantle and very difficult to hit militarily.' He also warned that Iran would develop more advanced centrifuges for fissionable material and return to underground bunkers. 'And they would be able to maintain that the reason they ended negotiations,' Obama warned, 'was that the United States was operating in bad faith, and blew up the deal.' 'There would be some sympathy to that view around the world, which means that the sanctions that we have in place now would potentially fray – because imposing these sanctions are a hardship on a number of countries around the world. They would love to be able to buy Iranian oil.' PROMISE: Obama vowed to Congress that he 'will be the first one to come to Congress and say we need to tighten the screws' if Iran backs away from the bargaining table . 'There is no good argument for us to try to undercut, undermine the negotiations until they've played themselves out,' the president said. 'Now if Iran ends up ultimately not being able to say yes, if they cannot provide us the kinds of assurances that would lead myself, David Cameron and others to conclude that they are not obtaining a nuclear weapon, then we are going to have to explore other options.'

"A woman arrested for shoplifting allegedly managed to steal a police cruiser and drive it at 100mph despite her hands being handcuffed behind her back. Police say that she manipulated the car’s controls with her back to the wheel, leading officers on a high-speed chase through the outskirts of Pittsburgh before ditching the car. The drama began when Roxanne Rimer, 27, was stopped by a security guard at Kohl’s in Center Township, Beaver County, because he suspected her of shoplifting. Scroll down for video . Police say that Roxanne Rimer (pictured under a blanket, 27, stole a police car and led officers on a 100mph chase . The police cruiser was left with visible damage following the chase . She is then said by officers to have sprinted off to her grandfather’s car, which also contained her mother, and urged him to drive away. When he refused, she took the controls herself and drove off over a hillside, according to wpxi.com. The news site said that police caught up with her and placed her in handcuffs in the back of a patrol car. Rimer allegedly drove at speed through the outskirts of Pittsburgh, bumping into cars along the way . The drama is said to have begun when Rimer fled a Kohl's store (pictured) after being suspected of shoplifting . She then allegedly climbed through the glass partition, manoeuvred herself into the driver’s seat and put the car into gear. Center Township Police Chief Barry Kramer said: ‘With her back turned and her hands cuffed behind her back, she manages to put it in gear and drive. And from what we can gather, she drove at very high speeds with that position, somehow manipulating the gears and steering the wheel.’ Kramer said she eventually ditched the patrol car and hitched a ride with someone, who dropped her off in Aliquippa. The police cruiser was left with visible damage following the chase and several cars belonging to members of the public were reportedly rammed. Kramer added: ‘Aliquippa police picked her up still in handcuffs. Thank god no one else was hurt.’ As she was being led to jail she told a Wpxi reporter ‘I don't remember anything but being in the back of a police car’. Rimer faces several charges, including aggravated assault.","Roxanne Rimer, 27, allegedly stole a police car, despite being handcuffed .

"A suicide bomber has killed at least six people, and wounded ten, after blowing himself up in a busy market in the Nigerian city of Gombe. The brutal attack bears all the hallmarks of Islamist group Boko Haram, although no one has yet claimed responsibility for it. They have killed thousands of Nigerians in gun and bomb assaults in the last five years - particularly in the hard to reach areas in the north-east of the country where Gombe lies. Umar Shittu, a spokesman for the National Management Agency for Gombe, said: 'Our workers have evacuated six bodies and 10 injured, and we believe there could more bodies because the market is usually populated.'

Refuge: People from Baga and Doron Baga had to take shelter in the Maiduguri Province (pictured) after their homes were destroyed in Boko Haram's 'deadliest ever attack' Earlier this week, satellite images emerged showing the aftermath of Boko Haram's 'deadliest ever attack' on the villages of Baga and Doron Baga. The pictures, released by Amnesty International, showed how over 2,000 people were brutally murdered - and 3,7000 buildings were razed to the ground by the extremist group. In the pictures taken beforehand, areas in red showed buildings and trees in the densely packed towns in the north of the country. But in the pictures taken after the massacre, grey areas reveal how the the town has been decimated by the assault. The destruction shown in these images matches the horrific stories from eyewitnesses revealing how Boko Haram militants shot hundreds of civilians in cold blood. One witness described how the ruthless terror group were shooting indiscriminately, killing even small children and a woman who was in labour. He added: 'Half of the baby boy is out and she died like this.' Ibrahim Gambo, a 25-year-old truck driver, survived the relentless attack in Baga but he still doesn't know if his wife and daughter are safe. He said: 'As we were running for our lives, we came across many corpses, both men and women, and even children. 'Some had gunshot wounds in the head and some had their legs bound and hands tied behind their backs.'

"He is a reputed Colombo gangster who is serving a 50-month jail term for extortion. But Giuseppe Destefano has asked for permission to travel out of state - to attend his 2017 wedding. The convict, who is housed in Fort Dix, New Jersey, hopes he will have been released early for good behavior by the time he is due to wed his fiancée, Josephine Tanga, on New Year's Eve that year.

"A teenager accused of raping and murdering his high school math teacher told police how he knocked her out with a 'karate chop' before slicing her neck two times with a box cutter, a court has heard. Detective Sergeant Phil Tansey from Danvers, Massachusetts, police described to a jury at Essex Superior Court how Philip Chism, now 14, described the details of Collen Rizter's grisly death after he was arrested in October 2013. The youngster, who was 14 at the time, allegedly helped investigators recover the body by pointing to the spot on a map of woods behind Danvers High School where he dumped her corpse. Tansey told the court that Chism confessed to murdering the popular 24-year-old during police interviews, but denied sexually assaulting her with a stick which was found near her body. Authorities say surveillance video from October 22, 2013, shows Chism following Ritzer into a bathroom in Danvers High School, wearing gloves and a hood, then later walking out of the bathroom alone. Philip Chism, 15, (pictured during an appearance at Essex Superior Court last week) told detectives he killed teacher Collen Ritzer with a box cutter by slicing it across a neck, a court has heard . Tansey's  statements came as Chism's lawyers look to throw out confessions and other evidence seized from him the night he was detained tossed out as evidence before trial. Superior Court Judge David Lowy made no ruling; the hearing is expected to continue later this month. A short time later, the video shows Chism pulling a recycling barrel through the school and outside. Ritzer's body was later found in nearby woods, naked from the waist down and with her throat slit and a note that read, 'I hate you all.' A recycling barrel was found near Ritzer's body. Authorities said she was sexually assaulted with a stick. Earlier Friday, prosecutors called on state Police Detective Lt. Norman Zuk, who testified that Chism said a 'trigger word' had set him off before the murder. Zuk did not say what that word was. Defense lawyers, meanwhile, called on Dr. Thomas Grisso, a retired University of Massachusetts professor and expert in juvenile psychiatry. He testified about the ability of juveniles to understand the implications of waiving their right to not speak with police. Allegations: The court heard that Chism (pictured last week) helped authorities locate her body by pointing at a map of the woods behind Danvers High School in Massachusetts. However he has denied sexually assaulting her with a stick . Grisso said adolescents tend to make decision based on 'what will that get me know' and can be more easily swayed than adults by the prospect of short-term benefits, such as getting to go home, sleep or eat. Defense lawyers say Chism was detained by police for more than three hours after he was picked up around 12:30 a.m. on Oct. 23. They say he had been handcuffed for most of the time, was not allowed to make a phone call and had asked a number of times for food. Chism has pleaded not guilty to murder and aggravated rape. He is being tried as an adult. Chism's lawyers say police coerced his mother, Diana, to get her then-14-year-old son into waiving his rights and making detailed statements about the murder. Prosecutors maintain Chism, who had recently moved to Massachusetts from Clarksville, Tennessee, and his mother never absolutely invoked their right to a lawyer. At a hearing last week, prosecutors played audio from Diana Chism's interview with police. The mother said her son was 'capable of snapping' under the recent stress of his parents' separation and that his family had a history of mental health issues. Two local police officers also testified they found Chism carrying Ritzer's ID and credit cards, a bloody box cutter and women's underwear. Chism told the officers a woman was 'buried in the woods' and could not be helped.

"Ambulances will be given longer to reach all but the most serious calls, NHS bosses have today revealed. Pilot schemes being run in parts of the country will give emergency call handlers an extra two minutes to decide whether to despatch an ambulance. Current rules mean call handlers have just 60 seconds to gather the information they need. The short time limit has prompted concerns that ambulances are being sent to patients who do not need them. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs the changes will 'improve patient safety'. Emergency call handlers will be given two minutes extra to decide whether to send an ambulance to patients, in all but the most serious, life-threatening calls, NHS England have said . In a written statement to Parliament, he said giving staff 'very limited extra assessment time would ensure that ambulances are better deployed to where they are most needed and would allow a faster response time for those patients who really need it'. 'There is significant evidence to suggest that giving call handlers extra assessment time to make the right decision for the patient could improve clinical outcomes and improve their chances of survival,' he said. It comes after the health secretary asked NHS England to consider new measures to help address 'an unprecedented increase in demand on ambulance services' in the last two months. The new arrangements will be put in place in pilot areas in the areas covered by the London Ambulance Service and the South West Ambulance Service. The plans will give call handlers up to 120 seconds longer to get all the information they need from a person making a non-life-threatening 999 call before deciding on the right response. Mr Hunt said the new plans will not include those calls which are immediately life-threatening - categorised as Red 1 calls and requiring a response time within eight minutes. The first pilot is expected to start in February, NHS England said. Professor Keith Willett, NHS England's national director for acute care, said: 'We are piloting these new arrangements because on medical grounds, we believe they will increase the availability of ambulance vehicles and paramedic staff, providing patients with a better service and improving their chances of survival, especially those with the most serious conditions.' In the pilot sites, a small number of potentially life threatening conditions, such as overdoses and certain types of gunshot wounds, will also be upgraded from the Red 2 category into the higher-priority Red 1 category so they receive a faster response than is currently the case. Professor Willett said: 'It's not about relaxing standards. 'By acting with slightly less haste on the calls, we believe we can get to more patients with more speed. 'Some conditions will be upgraded to Red 1 status, requiring a more urgent response than is currently the case.' NHS England said evidence shows that less than 10 per cent of 999 calls are for genuinely life-threatening conditions, yet currently around 40 per cent are classified as such, partly due to the lack of time the call handler has before the clock starts for determining whether an ambulance has arrived within the target time. To meet the current target of reaching 75 per cent of patients categorised as Red 2 within eight minutes, ambulance trusts frequently send vehicles to 999 callers before they have determined the exact nature of the problem. They may also send more than one vehicle, such as an ambulance and a rapid responder. On average, more than 20 per cent of vehicles are cancelled before reaching the scene, wasting resources which could be used for other patients. Mr Hunt said: 'At present, ambulance services are allowed only 60 seconds before the clock starts to decide what the right course of action is for that individual patient. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt said giving staff 'very limited extra assessment time would ensure that ambulances are better deployed to where they are most needed and would allow a faster response time for those patients who really need it' 'This sometimes leads to ambulances being dispatched unnecessarily, so that fewer ambulances are available for patients who really do need emergency assistance.' Mr Hunt said  an extension of the pilot scheme would not be permitted unless three tests were met: . He said the changes were being considered 'in light of the unprecedented increase in demand for ambulance services in the last two months'. Dr Anthony Marsh, chair of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives and Chief Executive of West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust and the East of England Ambulance Service Trust, said the changes will save lives. 'These changes will ensure that those people with the most serious conditions get the most urgent response, which will protect patients and save lives,' he said. 'The changes will also allow us to provide patients with the right level of care so that they get the best possible outcome. 'This is a change that our staff, who know the system better than anyone, have been pushing for as they know it will save countless lives.'","NHS England running pilot schemes in parts of London and South West .

"The U.S. Supreme Court declared Friday that it will decide whether same-sex couples nationwide have a right to marry under the Constitution, and get the question settled by June. The justices said they will review an appellate ruling that upheld bans on same-sex unions in four states. The case will be argued in April and a decision is expected before July. Gay rights advocates like Vin Testa (pictured) will anxiously await a resolution to the gay marriage debate just months from now .

Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee are among the 14 states where gay and lesbian couples are not allowed to marry. The number of states that permit same-sex marriage has nearly doubled in three months as a result of federal and state court rulings. The justices' decision to turn away same-sex marriage appeals in October and allowed some of those rulings to take effect. Florida last week became the 36th state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. If the high court rules that the bans in the current case violate the U.S. Constitution, gay-marriage floodgates in the remaining 14 states would open. The justices made their decision during a closed-door conference, opting to dispose of the issue in April, the last month for oral arguments before their next term begins in October. Written arguments will have to be filed on a compressed schedule, though both sides are well versed in the issues after numerous rounds in lower courts. On Friday the Supreme Court met in closed conference to decide whether it would take up cases including several concerning same sex-marriage and marriage recognition by states . In October, the justices offered no explanation when they passed up appeals from both sides calling on the court to take up gay marriage. The appeals before the court come from gay and lesbian plaintiffs in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. The federal appeals court that oversees them upheld same-sex marriage bans there in November, reversing rulings of federal judges in all four states.

"Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran may be shackled, blindfolded and executed by firing squad in the middle of the night. The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran (above) are scheduled for execution in 2015 . After living on death row in Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar, Indonesia, for almost a decade, and four failed clemency applications, Sukumaran and Chan are on a list of 26 prisoners Indonesia says will be executed this year. If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled. The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest. Chan and Sukumaran will also be given choice to stand, sit or lie down when the firing squad carries out their execution from a distance of between five and ten metres, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. In 2008, Nigerian nationals Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Antonious Nwaolisa were strapped to crucifixes with black hoods over their heads before being shot, reported news.com.au. 'It was simple: one, two, three, then ‘bang’,' said Father Charlie Burrows, who witnessed their deaths. The pair took nearly ten minutes to be pronounced dead, moaning and bleeding until they succumbed to their injuries. 'I think it is cruel, the torture...The blood came out slowly; they were in pain,' Father  Burrows said during his testimony before Indonesia’s Constitutional Court. Sukumaran and Chan (above) are on a list of 26 prisoners Indonesia says will be executed this year . If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled . The members of the Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 on charges of a plot to smuggle heroin into Australia . Inmate Marco Moreira, who is scheduled to die by firing squad on Sunday, is among four men and one woman scheduled to die just after midnight on Sunday morning, facing the 'Brimob'- five firing squads made up of 12 police. The Brazillian national was only given three days notice of his death by prison authorities who sat opposite him to break the news. Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th, while Chan's plea is yet to be finalised. Their fate rests heavily on Chan's clemency bid, as the pair have been informed that they will face execution together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia. Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot. 'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said. Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad. Brazillian national  Marco Moreira was given three days notice that he was to face the firing squad on Sunday . Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th . Mr McMahon labelled the 'injustice' of the situation 'heartbreaking' and said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system . Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.' 'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan. Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them. 'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said. News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf. Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution . A spokesperson for Denpasar District Court displays a Clemency Decree for Sukumaran . Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar, Bali, where Chan and Sukumaran are being detained . The petition was set up on Friday morning and had been attracting another signature every five seconds, reflecting the urgency of a previous Mercy Campaign petition which garnered more than 20,000 signatures. Mercy Campaign co-founder Brigid Delaney called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to increase his efforts to save the men's lives, calling his response 'very weak'. Mr Abbott said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution, but admitted he would not risk jeopardising diplomatic relations. 'If this does go ahead I think there will be such visceral outrage and questions will be asked of Tony Abbott - why didn't you do more?,' Ms Delaney said. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop made a direct appeal to Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, reported The Australian. 'They [the Australian Government] tried their utmost, they asked us to reconsider our decisions because their citizens have shown remorse, have expressed their deepest regrets,' said a spokesperson for Indonesia's Foreign Ministry. Mr McMahon labelled the 'injustice' of the situation 'heartbreaking' and said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system.

"Ambulances will be allowed to take longer to reach seriously ill patients under controversial plans announced by the Health Secretary. Jeremy Hunt yesterday unveiled a pilot scheme that will give operators an extra two minutes to assess 999 calls before dispatching paramedics. He said the added time will enable staff to establish if an ambulance is really needed, over concerns they are being sent out too readily to patients who are not seriously ill. But unions warned that the move would cost lives and dismissed the scheme as a ploy to meet targets ahead of the election. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) unveiled a pilot scheme yesterday that will give operators in the London and South West services an extra two minutes to assess 999 calls before dispatching paramedics . The ambulance service is under severe pressure and for the past nine months has persistently missed the target of responding to life-threatening calls within eight minutes. This week, operators at East of England and Yorkshire ambulance trusts were accused of downgrading calls in a ploy to make response times look quicker. The Government had previously denied reports it had been considering extending the waiting times for some serious calls from eight minutes to 19. Mr Hunt dismissed such reports as scaremongering but the new pilots will extend target times – albeit by a lesser amount. They will cover two of the ten ambulance services in England –London and the South West, who together cover 13million patients – and begin next month. Ambulances will be dispatched immediately only if it is a suspected cardiac arrest or major accident. For all other calls, including life-threatening cases such as strokes, breathing difficulties and blood clots, operators will get three minutes to assess patients. Presently they get one only minute and figures suggest they are wrongly categorising tens of thousands of non-serious calls as ‘life-threatening’. It is hoped the two added minutes will help operators better judge the needs of patients. Outlining the plans in a written statement to the Commons yesterday, Mr Hunt said there was ‘significant evidence to suggest that giving call handlers extra assessment time to make the right decision for the patient could improve their chances of survival’. Mr Hunt said the added time will help staff establish if  an ambulance is really necessary. Operators are currently given one minute to asses whether a situation is 'life-threatening' (file photo) He added: ‘Giving call handlers very limited extra assessment time would ensure that ambulances are better deployed to where they are most needed and would allow a faster response time for those patients who really need it.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham backed the idea of a pilot scheme but said that, with paramedics and A&E units under such pressure, they are poorly timed. ‘This is the worst winter for years in England’s A&Es. It is not the time for experiments,’ he said. ‘The Government must urgently provide reassurance this can be done without putting patient safety at risk.’ Tony Hughes, of the union GMB, which represents ambulance staff, said: ‘These pilots will only serve to bring worse outcomes for patients. ‘The run-up to the general election is clearly a factor so that the Tories can show that ambulance services are meeting their targets. This is so far from the truth.’ Professor Keith Willett, NHS England’s national director for acute care, said the new arrangements will increase the availability of ambulances. ‘By acting with slightly less haste on the calls, we believe we can get to more patients with more speed,’ he said. The pilot schemes were announced amid further concern over the NHS in Wales, with new figures showing that more than 15,000 patients were left languishing on trolleys for 12 hours or more last year in A&E units. Waiting times are the worst on record and even more abysmal than in England. Just 81 per cent of patients were treated within four hours, when the target is 95 per cent. Queues of ambulances seen stacked up outside hospitals in Wales over the past few days suggest that the current crisis is even more severe. Paramedic Stuart Gardner (pictured) claims he has been banned from two hospitals after revealing A&E were 'not safe' during a BBC interview . A paramedic says he has been banned from two hospitals after blowing the whistle on unsafe conditions in A&E units. Stuart Gardner of West Midlands Ambulance Service claims he was told to stay away after a BBC TV interview in which he said staff were regularly carrying out medical procedures in the corridors of Worcester Royal Hospital. But he says he has since been banned from the Royal in Worcester and Alexandra Hospital in Redditch because of the upset he had caused staff. Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust chief operating officer Stewart Messer allegedly emailed West Midlands Ambulance Service saying Mr Gardner ‘is no longer welcome on either of our hospital sites’. It is unclear how the alleged ban will work in practice, as Mr Gardner is continuing his work as a paramedic. Mr Messer says he supports whistleblowing and that his emails concerned the ‘personal upset’ Mr Gardner had caused A&E staff.","Operators to get two extra  minutes to assess 999 calls before dispatching paramedics .

"Nearly 2.5 million people - one in 20 adults - would like to quit Britain this year, according to new research. Lifestyle benefits are the biggest reason cited for leaving, while others are looking for a lower cost of living, better wages or to take advantage of exchange rates. And one in six of those set to quit the country  cite the current political climate in Britain. Nearly 2.5 million Britons would entertain the idea of moving to pastures new this year, research has revealed . America (18 per cent), Australia (17 per cent), France (10 per cent) and Spain (nine per cent) are the most popular destinations. A survey of 2,000 people by foreign exchange experts Currencies Direct reveals that one in 20 adults claim to be definitely leaving the country this year, be it temporarily or permanently, with a similar number  actively planning a move if not committed to one. Phil McHugh, Currencies Direct trading floor manager, said: 'This looks to be the year when a significant minority of Brits take flight abroad in search of a better life. 'Working overseas is a dream for many, but to make it a reality there are a whole host of costs and headaches that need to first be negotiated.' The US is the most popular destination for Britons wanting to emigrate, with 18 per cent choosing there . Work is the most common reason to head overseas (38 per cent), with others looking to study (30 per cent), volunteer (15 per cent) or retire (15 per cent). A third are heading off in pursuit of a better quality of life, with a quarter looking for the experience of living abroad. The economic benefits of life overseas also have a strong pull with 29 per cent believing the cost of living will be lower in another country - a factor that is even higher among young people (43 per cent) than retirees (33 per cent). One in 20 people stated currency as a reason to move abroad, with favourable exchange rates for Brits in some of the key destinations, thanks to a strong performance from the pound over the last six months. One in seven are expecting a higher wage, while 12 per cent are looking to save whilst overseas and eventually buy a property back in Britain. Australia is the second most popular destination to emigrate to, with Down Under being a very popular choice with the younger generation . Men are 50 per cent more likely than women to head abroad, while Brits aged 25 to 34 have the greatest wanderlust: the younger generation (15 per cent) being three times more likely than the national average to be moving abroad. One in five younger Brits heading abroad are looking to move Down Under, while those aged 55 or older are the group least likely to move to Oz. By contrast, retirement hotspot Spain is almost three times more popular with people in their 50s than their younger counterparts. Young Brits are also twice as likely as the average to want to move to the Middle East - a probable reflection of higher earning potential combined with lifestyle considerations making it a short-term move. Lifestyle benefits, a lower cost of living and better wages make Britons consider emigrating . Mr McHugh added: 'Those considering a move overseas should also make sure they do their financial homework properly, particularly with regard to a potential new home's cost of living, exchange rate and tax laws. 'There have been many positive and negative shifts of late, and it's important to be aware of these. For example in January 2014 the pound started the year at 1.65 to the US dollar, compared to the current rate of 1.51. Alternatively, in January 2014 the pound was trading at 1.20 against the euro, compared to 1.28 now. 'The exchange rate of a destination can make a real difference to a move overseas. Someone transferring their life's savings of £50,000 into a Spanish bank account would be €4,000 better off than this time last year, while the same person moving to the US would be nearly $7,000 down.'","Research reveals 2.5 million Britons would like to emigrate this year .

"The Scottish government is demanding tax cuts to bailout the oil industry, just four months after claiming that booming North Sea reserves would bankroll independence. The move has been ridiculed by supporters of the Union, who point out that if voters had backed independence in September the country would not be in crisis. The price of a barrel of Brent crude – the global benchmark – has more than halved since June to around $48 (£31.50). Experts predict it could fall as low as $31 (£20.44) by April. The oil industry has been plunged into crisis after the price of a barrel of Brent crude halved since June to around $48 . The weak oil price seriously undermines the claim by the SNP's Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon nationalists that an independent Scotland could rely on its natural resources. Scotland's Energy Minister last night issued a demand for new tax breaks to shore up the industry, after BP announced it was cutting 200 onshore workers and 100 contractor roles from its 3,500 staff in the North Sea. Mr Ewing said: 'It is clear to me that the UK Government has accepted it must act on tax. My question is why wait in respect of the supplementary charge until March . 'This is the most serious jobs situation Scotland has faced in living memory.' But rival parties have this week condemned the SNP for demanding help from Westminster just months after wanting to sever ties with the rest of the UK. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: 'The SNP told the people of Scotland the price of oil would rise and rise - that was a deceit. 'No end of experts pointed out the many flaws in this fanciful policy, but they were dismissed by the Scottish Government as scaremongering. 'In the last few weeks we've seen just how volatile the price of oil really is.' Scottish Labour's finance spokesman Jackie Baillie accused the Scottish Government of being 'silent on the issue' of the falling oil price. 'We know why the SNP are sitting on their hands. If they take the oil crisis seriously, it undermines their entire electoral strategy. 'The SNP cannot ignore a crisis which threatens jobs in Scotland now for their own political aims in May. Scotland needs a Government that will stand up for jobs and protect public services. The SNP have no intention of doing either.' Malcolm Webb, chief executive of industry body Oil & Gas UK, called for 'urgent action' to halt the decline and asked the Treasury to radically reduce the tax burden. He added: 'Tax rates ranging from 60 per cent to 80 per cent are no longer sustainable.' North Sea oil expert Sir Ian Wood, who carried out a major report for the UK government, is calling on Chancellor George Osborne to dramatically cut taxes on the industry by 10 per cent. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'What is really important is to look now, and set a tax regime that makes it absolutely clear, it's a medium-term tax regime as the oil price recovers. 'It's got to, in my opinion, include at least a 10 per cent tax reduction… to take it down to 50 per cent for normal corporation tax. On that basis, hopefully operators will have the motivation through what's going to be a very difficult period.' Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond used to claim oil revenues would generate the funds for Scotland to become an independent country . Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael is said to be pushing for 'tax relief for the sector' to be included in the March Budget. UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey said yesterday: 'I can't prejudge what the Chancellor will announce in the March Budget but I wouldn't be coming to Scotland today to talk to the industry if we weren't thinking about those issues. 'The threat to jobs has been brought home by the news from BP today. We have great sympathy with all those directly affected.' Rising production costs coupled with the global drop in fuel prices have forced energy companies to operate in tougher market conditions in the North Sea. Drilling for new oilfields in UK waters has fallen by a fifth, while exploration in other North Sea countries remains buoyant. UK Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to use the Budget in March to offer new tax breaks for the oil industry . But the idea of tax breaks buries the claim from the SNP that Scottish independence could be bankrolled by oil revenues. The Scottish government has also suddenly stopped publishing oil revenue projections which it used to release to show how Scotland could afford to go it alone. Bank of England governor Mark Carney this week warned Scotland had only been able to withstand the 'negative shock' of the plunging oil price by being within the Union. While falling oil costs benefit the economy as a whole, cutting the cost of travel and food in particular, Scotland is taking a hit. Mr Carney, appearing before the Commons Treasury Select Committee, was asked about an estimate that the slide would blow a £6 billion hole in Scotland's gross domestic product (GDP). He told MPs: 'It is a negative shock to the Scottish economy but it is a negative shock substantially mitigated by the fiscal arrangements in the UK.' BP has announced it is being forced to layoff some 300 staff due to the collapse in the price of oil (file photo) Mr Carney suggested the impact on Scotland of the lower price would be cushioned by the wider benefits to the UK as a whole - where falling petrol prices are putting more money into consumers' pockets. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned the falling oil price poses a risk of jobs in the North Sea. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: 'The SNP told the people of Scotland the price of oil would rise and rise - that was a deceit. 'No end of experts pointed out the many flaws in this fanciful policy, but they were dismissed by the Scottish Government as scaremongering. 'In the last few weeks we've seen just how volatile the price of oil really is.'","Price of a barrel of Brent crude has more than halved since June to $48 .

"John Stiles, 53, who was killed in a fall while hiking in the Russian mountains . The body of a British charity worker lay undiscovered in the Russian mountains for eight months after he plunged to his death during a hiking trip, an inquest heard. Father-of-two John Stiles had been working in Grozny, in the Chechen Republic, to help rehouse displaced Chechen refugees. His body  was found beneath Severny peak in the Tepli mountain range in North Ossetia - a peak he had tried to climb just two weeks prior to his death but the attempt was called off due to poor weather. Mr Stiles is thought to have fallen 'a substantial distance' to his death during the hike in November 2013. But bad weather meant his body was not found until the following July. Mr Stiles, who worked as a director with the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) in Grozny, regularly went to North Ossetia to hike during his two year stay in Chechnya, the hearing in Bradford was told. The 53-year-old from Ilkley, west Yorkshire, was dropped off at the base of the 3,800ft peak by his driver at 8am on November 2013, but failed to return at the agreed pick-up time of 6pm . The charity programme director, who previously worked for Save The Children UK, had met his wife, Isabelle, while they were both working in north Iraq in 1994. The inquest was told that Mr Stiles became quite 'lonely' in Chechnya, where the DRC was based, and took to the mountain region of Tepli to go hiking at the weekends. Mr Stiles had come home to visit his wife and their two children, Poppy and Hugo, in August 2013 before travelling back to Russia a month later. 'When he returned to Russia in September I am sure he was thinking he did not exercise much that summer or did not have a sporty time,' said Mrs Stiles . 'He decided to plan a few trips on weekends before the snow and winter. He did try to hike. He tried the peak that he eventually died on, two weeks before his death. He texted our daughter about not succeeding because of the weather. 'John loved being outdoors in the mountains and could not have spent two years in the country without trying to walk them. 'He had good judgement and he was very sensible. I trusted his judgement and felt he was responsible in his adventures. He would not take risks to be a hero. He had massive respect for his staff and would not be late for his driver.' A rescue team was sent out to find Mr Stiles but due to poor weather and fears of avalanche it was called off. The rescue was resumed on 17th July and his body was found the next day. Investigators in Russia said there was no third party involvement and a post-mortem revealed that the cause of death was most likely a fall from a significant height. Hospital surgery notes from 15 years ago were matched with a post mortem x-ray to confirm the body found in the remote Russian Caucasus mountains were his. The inquest heard that Mr Stiles, who had a degree in International Development from York University, was set to bring the programme he was working on in Grozny to an end in October 2014 and close the offices. Mrs Stiles said: 'It was a difficult task but he was very good at it. He was perfect for this. DRC had been there 15 years since the first war with Russia.' The DRC provided help and assistance to Chechen families displaced by the wars with Russia on housing, legal aid and income generation projects, she said. His body was found was found beneath Severny peak in the Tepli mountain range in North Ossetia . She added: 'John was extremely diplomatic, calm and friendly. He had a respect of culture and religion. I have never met anyone who fell out with him. 'He was supposed to come back and do his best to find a job in the UK, probably a charity headquarters in London. 'We have two young teenagers and we both decided he was needed at home.' The keen mountain walker, who had been on many trip with his wife and children, had discovered a love of the outdoors after joining the Scouts as a young boy in his home of Croydon. He later came to teach others and as well as being a dedicated scout leader in his youth volunteered for the 1st Ben Rhydding Scout Group later in life. The inquest was told he and a friend set up a company called High Adventure and took groups hiking to Pakistan. His career had seen him undertake humanitarian aid projects in North Iraq, where he met his wife through their work for the Kurds who had been displaced by Saddam Hussein's regime. Coroner Martin Fleming recorded a conclusion of 'accidental death' saying: 'I heard he was very much committed to his charity work. He was a much loved father and deeply missed by all who had the pleasure to know him. I have heard he was DRC director before his death and worked in Chechnya for some two years. I have noted he was a experienced fell and mountain walker with some thirty years-experience. 'It was thought he was going up the Severny peak which it 3,800 metres above sea level. The weather was good and clear. The search became hampered by snow fall and the risk of avalanche. The search was abandoned. On 17th July the search was resumed when the weather had cleared and during the search the body was found under the peak of Severny. 'Other people would benefit from his experience when he would take people off to see how it is done. He was a fit and healthy man. It is significant that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. 'I feel it is more likely than not that Mr Stiles lost his footing and fell to his traffic death. This must have been very hard for you and the family to bear. I would ask you to take away my sincerest sympathies at this very sad time for you.'","John Stiles was working with  refugees in Grozny, Chechen Republic .

"Imran Khan and his new wife Reham have found themselves at the centre of fresh controversy after a video emerged showing her handling and cooking pork sausages. In footage shot in 2011 when Mrs Khan was working for BBC South Today, she is shown at a fair in Ardingly, West Sussex, manning a butcher's stall. Two-time British sausage-making champion David Bell, who owns pork retailer Bangers Galore, then instructs her on the best way to cook pork with her following along. The clip has been circulated widely on the internet in recent days, and has caused outrage in her conservative Pakistan homeland, where strict Islamic law forbids touching or eating pork. Reham Khan, new wife of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, has found herself at the centre of fresh controversy in Pakistan after footage has emerged showing her touching and cooking pork . The footage, shot in 2011 while Mrs Khan was working for the BBC, has caused outrage after being circulated online. Strict Islamic law forbids the touching or eating of pork . However Mr Bell told The Times that he coudn't understand the outrage, adding that Reham 'didn't actually eat any of the pork sausages.' Former cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has been lambasted in past weeks over his secret wedding to Reham, a former BBC weather girl and current news anchor. Many conservative Pakistanis believe his marriage to a British-Pakistani divorcee is an unsuitable union for right-winger who has made great play of his Islamic faith. On a recent visit to the school in Peshawar where 132 children were massacred by the Pakistani Taliban the couple were jeered and had their convoy blocked by protesters chanting 'Go, Imran, go.' Activists were angered that news of Mr Khan's wedding had occupied a whole day of news coverage in Pakistan, taking attention away from their murdered children. Some also accused him of staging a media stunt 'to show fake prayers and condolences.' Mrs Khan worked at BBC South Today as a weather girl before moving back to Pakistan where she now presents a current affairs talk show on the Dawn News channel . The couple married in a small Muslim ceremony on January 8, causing outcry among Pakistan's conservative population who believed divorced mother-of-three Reham is a poor match for the politician . Rumours of a wedding have been circulating on social media for months, with users attacking Mrs Khan for her western lifestyle, including going to parties and dancing with unknown men in public . Mr Khan leads the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, which holds the third largest bloc of seats in the country's parliament and had previously spoken of challenging for the Pakistani presidency. But his public standing has been badly damaged since he wed Reham in his home of Islamabad on January 8 during a private ceremony to which none of his family were invited. Rumours of a marriage had been circulating for weeks online, with many expressing dismay at his choice of bride. Mr Khan initially tried to distance himself, saying news of a wedding was 'greatly exaggerated.' A Facebook hate-group has been attacking Mrs Khan since 2011, posting images of her at parties, wearing short skirts and dancing with men in public. The couple were booed and jeered by angry crowds when they visited the school in Peshawar yesterday where 132 children were massacred by the Pakistani Taliban a month previously . Crowds angry that news of the Khans' wedding had diverted a day of news coverage away from their murdered children chanted 'Go, Imran, go' and tried to block his motorcade . One post accused Mrs Khan of being a 'lesbian' because she was pictured with her hand on another woman's bare back at a party. In separate message the page's creator accused Mrs Khan's daughter of being a 'pornstar', claiming to have found topless modelling shots of her. Gossip began in October after Imran's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed she was ditching the surname ‘Khan’ and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry. She said at the time: ‘My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it’s probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.’","Clip of Reham Khan reporting from fair in West Sussex circulated online .

"Authorities say a 29-year-old woman from Chicago woman attempted to kill her son and daughter by lacing their apple juice with crushed tranquilizers. Krystle El Khatib of Schiller Park appeared on Thursday in Cook County court in Rolling Meadows on attempted murder charges. She is accused of mixing powder from crushed-up anti-anxiety pills into juice and forcing her nine-year-old son and four-year-old daughter to drink it on Sunday. Charged: Krystle El Khatib, 29, of Schiller Park has been charged with trying to kill her children by feeding them juice laced with drugs, according to prosecutors . Issues: The woman appeared in court Thursday on attempted murder charges. A judge set her bond at $1.5 million . Authorities say she was angry at the children's father and had sent him a threatening message. Then, they say she tried kill herself with a similar cocktail consisting of benzodiazepine and the painkiller Norco. Authorities say the 9-year-old boy woke up the following day, vomiting, and was able to get in touch with his father. Problems: The Illinois mom allegedly attempted to poison her son and daughter on Sunday . Prosecutors in court Thursday described El Khatib as being angry at the children's father for not wanting to spend time with her and not being home with the children. Authorities said she sent a text to the father Saturday that read: 'At least if I go to hell, I've already been there. The kids go to heaven. Peace from all.' Officials say the children have recovered and are now in the custody of their dad. A judge set her bond at $1.5 million. Her public defender says she has no criminal history. El Khatib was later found at her home by police and also taken to the hospital. At the hospital, a criminal complaint against El Khatib says she 'told a social worker at the hospital that she brought her kids into this world and she can take them out.' Staff at the hospital sent a police officer to check on Krystle El Khatib. When the law enforcement officers arrived at her home, they found that she was also in need of medical attention. Fall from grace: Records show El Khatib filed for bankruptcy In 2007. At that time, she listed Comcast Cable as her employer but, more recently, she described herself in online profiles as an actress and model . El Khatib reportedly told the police that she gave the anti-anxiety drugs to her children because she “wanted all three of them to go to sleep and not wake up.” The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is currently investigating allegations of abuse and neglect inside the El Khatib home. The child protection agency had not had any prior contact with the family. Tumultuous relationships: El Khatib was married for a short time to Bill Intzekiotis, records show. She was 17 at the time of their marriage, Intzekiotis said, and they divorced after less than a year .","Krystle El Khatib, 29, allegedly crushed up benzodiazepine pills, an anti-anxiety drug .

"Two senior journalists at the Sun newspaper walked free from court yesterday after being cleared of paying public officials for stories. The paper's picture editor John Edwards, 50, wept as he and former reporter John Troup, 49, were acquitted of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. Former managing editor Graham Dudman, 51 and ex-deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll, 38, were also cleared of some charges. Two senior journalists at the Sun newspaper walked free from Kingston Crown Court, pictured, yesterday after being cleared of paying public officials for stories . But the jury are still deliberating on a number of charges in the case at Kingston Crown Court which has heard allegations that six reporters and editors at the tabloid paid out thousands of pounds to police officers, soldiers, prison and hospital staff for information about celebrities, killers and the Royal Family. Former East Anglia reporter John Troup can now start to rebuild his life after being fired from Uttlesford District Council, where he was head of communications, immediately after his arrest in January 2013 over a single accusation that he paid a prison guard for one story. The weakness of the case against him was exposed when he took the witness box and it emerged he had not even written the story he was accused of paying for. The former top reporter, who spent 19 years at the tabloid exposing gang warfare in Manchester and revealing security flaws at Heathrow Airport after the Lockerbie crash was reduced to slicing bacon at the local butchers to make ends meet following his arrest. His former colleague, John Edwards, was also acquitted yesterday of two counts, that he conspired to pay Broadmoor nurse Robert Neave and Surrey Police officer Simon Quinn for confidential information. The Sun's picture editor John Edwards and former reporter John Troup were acquitted of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. Pictured, the News Corporation headquarters in Wapping, east London . Yesterday Dudman was acquitted of paying a prison guard at HMP Whitemoor for a story about a prisoner's suicide.

"A Towie fan who who ran away to Syria with her toddler son has escaped from the clutches of ISIS and fled to Turkey after begging border guards not to shoot her. Tareena Shakil from Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire, crossed into Syria last year after telling relatives she was going on holiday to Spain with her young son Zaheem. But after becoming disillusioned with the fanatical regime, the 25-year-old has crossed back over the Turkish border where she is now being held by authorities. Tareena Shakil, pictured left with her young son, Zaheem, fled to Syria with her son in November last year. The 25-year-old has since crossed the Turkish border and is being held by authorities . Shakil, a former Morrisons worker, fled to the ISIS stronghold city of Raqqa in November last year. From there, she posted fanatical messages and sent selfies to family in Britain, telling relatives she and her young son would never return. West Midlands Police confirmed the young mother was being held by Turkish authorities who are working alongside British forces. Still considered a missing person, it is understood Shakil will be returned to the UK. 'We are aware a missing British woman travelling from Syria has been detained by Turkish authorities for immigration matters,' a spokesman for West Midlands Police told MailOnline. 'Police are working with the Turkish authorities to ensure her safe return the UK.' In November the former Morrisons worker posted this selfie with her son from her home in an ISIS stronghold of the pair of them smiling . After fleeing her British home in November last year, Shakil entered Syria through the Turkish border. She has since returned to the country after 'begging guards not to shoot her' The residential street where Shakil lived in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire. Previously her father said he was 'heartbroken' she had left the country with his grandson . Shakil is believed to have fled to this refugee camp in Gaziantep, Turkey. She is now being held by authorities . Her reported escape from Raqqa comes just two months after she posted a selfie with her son from her home inside the ISIS stronghold. It has been claimed the young mother fled fanatics after being attacked by a would-be suitor. A family friend of Shakil told the Sun's Dan Sales: 'They tried to force her to marry a man and when she refused he attacked her. 'She decided she couldn't take it anymore, broke into a property and stole her passport. 'The border guards didn't fire for some reason - maybe because she was carrying her son. Her hands were hurt and her feet cut to ribbons climbing the fence.' Previously her father Mohammed, 42, said she sent him the picture to show they had arrived but she has since cut off all contact. He has told of how his daughter was a one-time Spice Girls fan, school prefect and Girl Guide and was so fascinated with the ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex, that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars. Her parents said she was wearing items she bought there when she set off for Syria in October. Mr Shakil said his daughter did a psychology degree and got married, although she later divorced. But around six months ago she set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages, including images of Islamist fighters and the ISIS black flag, and calling herself a 'slave to Allah'. After fleeing, Shakil told her family how she was in Raqqa and could never return to the UK. In one message she wrote: 'I can't come back there now … we can't. Tell her don't cry. Read the Koran, I love you mummy!' Around six months ago she set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages . One of the images posted by Tareena on the social media page which has since been removed . Friends say that she wanted to flee from the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa because the group were going to force her to marry a jihadi . And of her journey, she said: 'So many people died coming. They got shot at the border. But we made it. We ran across the border in the blazing sun.' Despite posting extremist material online, Shakil is still being considered a person of interest by the authorities and may not face criminal charges. Social services have not been involved by British forces with regard to her young son's care. 'All decisions on returnees from Syria or Iraq are taken on a case-by-case basis,' a spokesman for the Home Office said. 'Some of these people may have been exposed to traumatic experiences and others may be radicalised or vulnerable to radicalisation. 'For some, prosecution for terrorist offences is the right course of action. 'For others, it may be that support from, for example, mental health or social services, is more appropriate.'","Tareena Shakil fled to Syria with her toddler son in November 2014 .

"Medicare's top administrator unexpectedly resigned Friday, becoming the latest casualty of the troubled rollout of the president's health care law. A former intensive care nurse with a businesslike approach to one of the most divisive areas of public policy, Marilyn Tavenner told staff in an email that she's stepping down at the end of February with 'sadness and mixed emotions.' Tavenner survived the technology meltdown that initially paralyzed Healthcare.gov but was embarrassed last fall when she testified to Congress that 7.3 million people were enrolled for coverage. The number turned out to be an overcount that exaggerated the total by about 400,000 people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Centers for Medicare and Medicaid chief Marilyn Tavenner quit on Friday and said she's leaving with 'sadness and mixed emotions' She played a key role in the 2013 decision to go live with Healthcare.gov, signing a cyber security clearance required by government rules after technology professionals under her balked because testing was incomplete. The website later passed security tests and received full authority to operate. One of the Republicans' leading congressional flamethrowers said on Friday that 'Tavenner had to go.' California Rep. Darrel Issa said 'she presided over CMS as it deceptively padded the Obamacare enrollment numbers.' 'It was a deplorable example of an agency trying to scam the American people. They weren’t successful this time because of Congressional oversight. We deserve better.' Still, another senior Republican said he's sorry to see Tavenner leave. 'She has proven herself to be a strong leader and a straight shooter who brought in much-needed private sector sensibility into the agency,' Utah GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a statement. 'I truly appreciate her service and wish her the very best in her next adventure.' Calling Tavenner 'one of our most esteemed and accomplished colleagues,' Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said the decision to leave was Tavenner's. Tavenner joined the Health and Human Services department shortly before the passage of the Affordable Care Act. She came from state government, having served as Virginia's health secretary under former Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine. Although she started out in nursing, most of her career was spent in hospital administration. She rose through the ranks to become a top executive of Hospital Corporation of America. Andy Slavitt, a former technology executive who played a leading role in the rescue operation to get Healthcare.gov working, will take over as acting Medicare administrator. Slavitt has been serving as Tavenner's principal deputy, responsible not only for Healthcare.gov but for key Medicare and Medicaid issues as well. A permanent replacement requires Senate confirmation. Any presidential nominee could face rough going in the Republican-led Senate. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the newly minted majority leader, said Friday that 'no one could have successfully managed a law as unworkable as Obamacare.' 'We now call on the President to nominate someone whose sole focus will be to look out for our nation’s seniors and the many vulnerable Americans who use these programs, and not distract them from that task with Obamacare. 'We also call on President Obama to work with us to replace this law with real reforms that lower costs and don’t hurt the middle class the way Obamacare does,' he said.","Centers for Medicare and Medicaid chief Marilyn Tavenner quit on Friday .

"A mum who was once one of Britain's fattest women has described her 50-year battle with her weight, including once shedding 28 stone in 12 months. Joan Thorpe, 58, from Wiltshire, says she was a 'human dustbin' who ballooned to over 38 stone as a teenager in response to the bullies who hounded her. She was branded a 'big fat donkey' by cruel tormentors who would physically assault her - leading her to try and take her own life. Scroll down for video . Joan Thorpe has endured a life-long struggle with her weight but has now lost 9st 4lb on doctor's orders . Now the mother-of-two has joined a campaign to stamp out weight discrimination after years of bullying from fellow classmates and even passersby shouting at her on the street. Joan's weight gain began in childhood and resulted in a hip replacement operation because of her obesity when she was just 13. She said: 'I was always a big child but when I hit my teenage years that's when this got really bad, the other pupils were so cruel to me. 'Every day I would get bullied, called names and have kids jumping on my back and smacking my bum, telling me I was just a big fat donkey and I would have to carry them through the school to our next class. 'I would have my lunch stolen off me while being told I was too fat and did not need to eat. In fact it got so bad that I tried to take my own life as I felt I could not go on. 'I was massive. I couldn't walk. I had to carry my belly around with me like of a sack of potatoes and had to go to bed after walking down the garden path because it made me so ill. She was told her weight would make her infertile, but the mum-of-two is now a grandmother of twins, above . 'I used to eat loads of junk foods - crisps, cake, chocolates, biscuits, pasties, chips - anything I could get hold of. I would just eat and eat and eat. 'I drank a lot of spirits and Coke. Not Diet Coke, I used to be really greedy. I was a human dustbin really. I just wanted to be left alone. Left alone to die.' At 18, Joan was told by a doctor told her that she might die within two months unless she lost weight and she might never be able to have children. She dropped from  28.6 stone to 9.4 stone in just one year after she went on a crash diet. The mother-of-two says she has fought a life-long struggle against the fluctuating pounds and the taunts that have accompanied and caused them. The taunts did not stop after she left school, complete strangers have called her cruel names in the street throughout adulthood. Joan has asked people to be kinder to those who are overweight in a new campaign ShowHeart, launched by Slimming World. Joan has struggled with eating since she was a child and at her heaviest ballooned to 38 stone . Joan said: 'People shouldn't have to be slim to be treated decently and with respect, though. 'I truly believe that if we want to tackle obesity as a society then we need to start being kinder to each other. 'Even in adult life, I used to walk down the street and people used to shout at me.' Joan holds up her old jeans now that she's shed 9st to 13.6st after tipping the scales at 23st . In September 2013 she tipped the scales at 23 stone and a doctor again warned that her weight, and her consequent high blood pressure and diabetes, were endangering her health. After joining Slimming World last autumn, Joan shed 9.4 stone, weighing in at a healthier 13.6stone, and a clothing size 18. Her confidence has blossomed since the pounds began dropping off again. She said: 'I've got loads of confidence now. I can lift my head up and go outside every day now. Now I go for all the healthy options - salads, cereal, eggs. 'I hope Slimming World's ShowHeart campaign will encourage people to be kinder to overweight people and help those who are struggling with their weight to gain the confidence to seek help, whenever they feel ready.' Two in three people admitted they turned to food for comfort after suffering discrimination - while only two per cent of people make healthy changes, according to Slimming World's survey of 2,573 overweight people. And 40 per cent of overweight people feel the pain of humiliation, criticism or judgment at least once a week. This treatment left people feeling ashamed, depressed and useless, the research showed. The survey also showed that around 61 per cent of those questioned said they were more likely to be greeted by strangers with a smile since losing weight. Slimming World's research specialist Professor James Stubbs said: 'As a society we need to think more about how we treat people who struggle with weight and we need to be more aware of how discrimination can impact on people's feelings and lifestyle behaviours.","School jibes of 'big fat donkey' drove her to attempt to take her own life .

"Meet Pepper the pug - a dog who owes her life to Babygros and onesies after being born with a debilitating stretchy skin condition. Pepper's skin is so fragile that it blisters and tears at the slightest touch, with the condition so severe that vets advised putting the dog down when she was just a few weeks old. But devastated owner Nicola Galpin came up with the method of dressing her pug in the protective clothes to stop Pepper from rubbing and damaging her skin. Scroll down for video . Pepper the pug, pictured with loving owner Nicola Galpin, wears Babygros and onesies to protect her as she has a debilitating stretchy skin condition . Pepper's skin is so fragile that it blisters and tears at the slightest touch, with vets advising Mrs Galpin to put the dog down when she was just a few weeks old . Pepper has a condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which causes her excessively stretchy skin to tear easily . The pampered dog's extensive wardrobe includes six Babygros, two cardigans, two coats and one Christmas jumper, which all provide the vital protection that keeps her alive. Mrs Galpin, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, said: 'I love wrapping her up in clothes. She needs the protection because her skin is so weak but it makes me feel nice too. She looks absolutely adorable but it's also for her own good, it's kept her alive. 'The vets said she would probably tear her skin so often it would be kindest to put her down, but I couldn't give up on her and knew I would find a way to keep her safe. 'She has a lack of collagen in her body, meaning that she has nothing to hold her skin in place, but the Babygros really help her- it's amazing.' Pepper has a condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which causes her excessively stretchy skin to tear easily. The condition can also affect humans. Dogs suffering from the condition do not usually survive beyond their first few months, but at almost two years old, Pepper is still going strong. Most dogs with Pepper's condition do not live beyond a few months, but the dog is now two years old thanks to Mrs Galpin's idea of wearing protective clothing . The pampered dog's extensive wardrobe includes six Babygros, two cardigans, two coats and one Christmas jumper . However, Mrs Galpin was on the brink of giving up on her young puppy in Christmas 2013 when Pepper, just seven months old, needed an operation to repair her hips. The 41-year-old said: 'Afterwards she had so many tears and holes in her body, the vet advised us to put her down but she was only a puppy and so full of love. We just couldn't do it.' Today, Pepper is still going strong despite having to be checked for cuts on a regular basis. She is now 18 months old and is showing no signs of slowing down. Mrs Galpin said: 'She doesn't even notice that there's anything wrong. She runs around like a maniac, is extremely playful and loves her life. 'In some positions she looks like she's wearing a hoodie because her skin hangs about two inches underneath her body and gathers all around her joints. 'Sometimes, she's got so much excess skin that you can wrap your hand in her like a glove. 'She's never in pain. She doesn't even notice any new cuts until she starts playfully licking them.' Pepper, pictured when she was a puppy, is playful and energetic just like any other young dog . The pug underwent an operation on her hips when she was seven months old but fortunately pulled through . Now Pepper is helping other dogs with the condition and has a Facebook page called 'My name is Pepper....Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome will not beat me!!' Mrs Galpin said: 'People from all over the world have joined to get help and advice from her and me. 'Someone even sent me a medical ointment, called Equiade, that is usually used on horses, which we've found is really helpful for treating Pepper's wounds. A spokesman for the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation said: 'Dogs show not only the same clinical and pathological features as humans with EDS but they also have the same problems with medical management. 'Dogs with EDS have skin and joint laxity that far exceeds that of any normal dog. Often, they have luxated hip joints but do not appear to have pain associated with it. 'Despite the shorter life expectancy, they are able to run and play like most other dogs.'","Pepper the pug has a severe condition that makes her skin extra stretchy .

"The village shop and post office at the heart of Britain's 'most desirable community' has gone on the market for £750,000. Cerne Abbas, in Dorset, was voted the most sought-after village in the country thanks to its proximity to outstanding schools, welcoming country pubs and its quality of housing. Now, for the first time in more than 30 years, the popular village stores and post office, with a spacious six-bedroom home wrapped around it, has gone up for sale. The village shop and post office at the heart of Britain's 'most desirable community' has gone on the market for £750,000 . The shop in Cerne Abbas, Dorset, has a weekly turnover of £10,000 and comes with a spacious six-bedroom property . Cerne Abbas Stores has been at the heart of the community for over 250 years, with the current owners Andrew and Gerry Farrow moving to the village in 1984. In 1993, villagers showed their community spirit, raising £12,000 in just three days to stop the shop going bankrupt when Mr Farrow was faced with rising debts from improvements he was forced to make to meet hygiene regulations. Mr Farrow, who used to work as an accountant in London, and his wife saved the village post office in 2006 when he took over as sub-postmaster after the previous one retired. The quaint double-fronted shop has thrived since and now has a turnover of about £10,000 a week. Estate agents Savills ruled the Dorset village, which has a population of about 800, the most attractive village in Britain to prospective buyers. Andrew Farrow (pictured) and his wife Gerry are selling Cerne Abbas Stores after more than 30 years of ownership . The quaint double-fronted shop has thrived and would be perfect for someone looking to escape the rat race, estate agents Christie & Co say . Jonathan Southgate, of estate agents Christie & Co, said: 'The village shop has been in the same spot, in the same building for 250 years. It really has been a staple of the community. 'The couple who own it are looking to retire. 'This gentleman originally moved from the home counties and that's who we think this would appeal to - somebody who is fed up with the rat race and wants a slice of country life with a business that will support that. 'This business would be perfect for a husband and wife team or two families coming together. 'It's a really pretty village, it was voted most desirable village and it's had many accolades over the years. It's a really lovely place to live.' As well as the shop, the accommodation goes over three floors and has six double bedrooms, a family bathroom, a shower room and a separate bathroom. Cerne Abbas, which has a population of about 800, was ruled the most attractive village in Britain to prospective buyers . 'Desirable' Cerne Abbas is also well-known for its 180ft chalk giant figure on a nearby hill . Mr Farrow, 65, said: 'There are various things in the community that are focal points and we are the main one. There's also three pubs and a tea rooms. 'It's not a big village but it's got a lot of facilities and it's a tourist destination. 'I think that's why the shop has survived so well. We stock what the customers want and make sure they leave with a smile on their face. 'We also open seven days a week so we get trade from other nearby villages. 'But my wife wants me to do other things now, and I want to. I've just finished my second honours degree and advanced French exam and feel it's time for a change. 'I think it needs a fresh pair of eyes and enthusiasm to make the store even better.' Cerne Abbas, near Dorchester, appears in Thomas Hardy's novels as Abbots Cernel and has a 13th century church as well as the ruins of a Benedictine abbey. The village is also well-known for its 180ft chalk giant figure on a nearby hill.","Village shop and post office in 'most desirable' village goes on the market .

"Tina Love, 29, (pictured) from Dartford, Kent, lunged at mother-of-three Julie McDonald, 50, pinned her down and then bit a chunk from her nose . A mother headbutted and then bit a woman's nose in a 'shark-style attack' during a children's pantomime at Butlins in a row over the victim's disabled son, a court has heard. Tina Love, 29, from Dartford, Kent, lunged at mother-of-three Julie McDonald, 50, pinned her down and then bit a chunk from her nose. The 'nasty assault' happened after a disagreement about a table during a Jack and the Beanstalk show at Butlins Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis, West Sussex. A 3cm by 3cm piece of the victim's nose was found on the floor after the attack on April 11, 2013. Chichester Crown Court heard the day before the assault there had been some 'interaction' between the McDonald family and the defendant. Love's two young children were seen 'laughing' and 'swearing' at Ms McDonald's son, who has 'severe learning difficulties'. Today a jury of seven women and five men took just 48 minutes to convict her of wounding with intent. On the night of the attack, the McDonald family went down to the Centre Stage of the Manhattan Building at the camp to watch the pantomime. After finding a table, which appeared to be free, the victim sat down but was confronted by Love who said: 'Oi, that's my table'. The defendant then waved her finger in Ms McDonald's face and said: 'What are you going to do about it?' Ms McDonald and her daughter continued to look for tables as the pantomime continued and made 'spitting sounds' as the defendant walked past. Love then 'lunged' at Ms McDonald and 'headbutted' her before biting her nose. Rachel Beckett, prosecuting, said: 'Suddenly the defendant lunged at Ms McDonald and headbutted her, Ms McDonald fell back onto a seat. 'The defendant then got on top of her and bit her nose. 'She pinned her down and held onto her nose, Ms McDonald felt that her entire nose was being bitten off. She then pushed the defendant away. 'Ms McDonald was screaming in pain and felt blood pouring from her nose. 'While being booked into custody, the defendant said 'I hit her in self defence'. The assault took place during a show at Butlins Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis, West Sussex (pictured) Ms McDonald, a full time carer from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, gave evidence via videolink from Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court, and described the assault as a 'shark attack'. She said: 'She the launched herself at me and I felt this person biting my nose with full force. 'I have never been bitten by a shark but that is the only think I can liken it to. It was like being attacked by a shark. There was this person biting my nose with all of her might. 'It felt like my whole nose was being bitten off. I was completely traumatised.' The court previously heard how Love 'feared for her life' during the incident. The mother of three told the court their heads 'collided', and added: 'I was on top of her at this stage - I was just terrified. 'I then just turned and I bit - I didn't know where I was biting. 'I was terrified - I just wanted her to stop. 'It was all so fast and I was shocked and I feared for my life. 'I did not realise at any time that I had bitten her nose, I did not know where I was biting.' She will be sentenced at the same court next month.

"A couple have been charged with child neglect after allegedly using meth in front of their children and allowed swinging partners to come to the house while the kids were home. Andra Rae Martinez, 43, and Juan Martinez, III, 44, were charged with endangering a child in Houston, Texas on Thursday. Police said the couple left meth and pot in front of their children, a ten-year-old boy and six-year-old girl, and also allowed strange men to come to the house to have sex with the wife. Andra Rae Martinez, 43, and Juan Martinez, III, 44, have been charged with endangering a child in Houston, Texas after allegedly taking part in their drug-taking, swinging lifestyle in front of their children . According to ABC, the husband would put ads online for men to come to the home and have sex with his wife. He also allegedly offered his six-year-old daughter for sex acts to one man, a claim which police were investigating. Investigators began looking into the couple's drug-filled, swinging behavior last September after a tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A search of the home uncovered drugs which were easily in reach of the children and they were also exposed to porn DVDs with explicit covers. Both parents denied having sexual interest in children despite court documents alleging that the father had incest fantasies. The ten-year-old boy reportedly told police he was worried his father would get in trouble for 'smoking something illegal'. Juan Martinez's bail was set at $30,000 and Andra Martinez's at $2,000. Daily Mail Online was awaiting comment from the Webster Police Department on Friday.","Andra Rae Martinez, 43, and Juan Martinez, III, 44, have been charged with endangering a child in Houston, Texas .

"A truck allegedly stolen by two teen runaways has been found dumped in Georgia - as their days-long crime spree reaches a fifth state. Cheyenne Philips, 13, and her older boyfriend, Dalton Hayes, 18, were last seen at Hayes' home in Grayson County, Kentucky on January 4 and have been on the run ever since. More than a week later, on Sunday 12, they allegedly stole a truck from a couple's home in Clarkson, Kentucky before driving through a cattle farm and abandoning the damaged vehicle. The following day, they were spotted on surveillance footage walking around a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina and driving yet another stolen pickup. 'Crime spree': Dalton Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, are seen on surveillance footage inside a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina on Monday. The young couple has been missing from Kentucky for two weeks . On the run: The teenagers are believed to have stolen three trucks and caused $7,500 damage to one . By Wednesday, that pickup truck was found dumped in Henry County, Georgia, ABC News reported, and another nearby vehicle - a silver 2001 Toyota Tundra - was reported stolen. To get from Kentucky to South Carolina and then to Georgia, the couple likely also drove through Tennessee and North Carolina, bringing their crime spree to five states. Authorities have not offered a motive for the spree, but NBC reported that Hayes was a suspect in other robberies, while his mother said they fled after she confronted Phillips about her age. On January 4, Phillips' father reported the girl missing after she spent the night of January 3 at Hayes' home, WHAS reported. Police contacted Hayes' mother, Tammy Martin, who said she thought her son's girlfriend was 19 - not a seventh-grader. She told WDRB that the couple had been together for three months and her son did not know the girl's real age either. Runaways: Phillips, left, and Hayes, 18, were last seen in Kentucky on January 4 after his mother confronted the girl about her age. Before then, she thought the girl was 19, she said . Journey: The teens are believed to have traveled across five states - Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia - during their alleged crime spree since disappearing on January 4 . Rebels: Hayes' mother said her son also believed that 13-year-old Cheyenne was 19 . 'He's told me that he loves her,' she said. 'He actually bought her an engagement ring.' After the police contacted her, she sent a message to the girl. 'I texted Cheyenne and said the police are looking for you, she says why, I said they say you're under aged,' she told WHAS. When Martin returned home, the pair were gone. After they had been on the run for a week, police started seeking them for a different reason. On Sunday evening, Jim and his wife Kathy McGrew returned to their home in Grayson County from church to find the duo stealing their truck, WHAS reported. The teenagers raced down the road with police in pursuit, before tearing across a cattle farm, smashing into a fence and driving into the woods. They then fled through the trees on foot. Mr McGrew searched for them in his plane while police used a K-9 unit, but all they found was the abandoned, wrecked truck with $7,500 worth of damage and a trail of clothes left behind. 'Victims': Kathy and Jim McGrew said they arrived home on Sunday to find the teens stealing their truck . Damage: After taking chase with the help of police, they found the damaged truck, pictured, in nearby woods . Later that day, they stole a red 2006 Toyota Tacoma, the sheriff said. There was a firearm inside the car when it was taken. The vehicle was seen outside a Walmart in South Carolina the following day and surveillance footage also shows them inside the store. While in Walmart, the teens used a stolen check that was $20 over the items they were buying, so the cashier gave them the difference back in cash, Manning Police Chief Blair Shaffer said. They then repeated the ploy with another stolen check, walking away with $40 in cash, Shaffer said. On Wednesday, the second truck was found dumped and another within walking distance was taken. That vehicle, which belongs to a firefighter, also had firearms inside at the time it was stolen from just south of Atlanta in Henry County, police said. Tammy Martin said she's worried about what her son might do. 'He's never went this long without contacting me, and it's really very stressful,' she said. 'I'm just worried that they're not safe anymore.' Nonchalant: The couple was then seen the following day inside the Walmart in South Carolina, pictured . All smiles: The sheriff believes that the older teen is calling the shots and fears he may not stop if confronted . 'Plot': The teenagers allegedly used two forged checks to get cash back from the cashier at Walmart . Escape: The couple left in this 2006 Toyota Tacoma, which was later found dumped in Georgia . Phillips' mother also made a tearful plea for her daughter to return. 'It's really hard knowing your child is out there,' Sherry Peters told WSBTV crying. 'Please come home, please come home. We can work through whatever that it is.' Hayes is wanted for custodial interference and other offenses. Both are suspected in at least two felony thefts and other crimes but no charges have been announced, Grayson County Sheriff Norman Chaffins said. When asked about the underage relationship, Chaffins said: 'We're not worried about that right now.' He called for the two to be arrested or turn themselves in 'as their behavior is becoming increasingly brazen and dangerous'. 'We just want them to come in, turn themselves in because eventually it's just going get worse for them, and law enforcement, and we do not want that to happen,' Chaffins told WLKY. Have you seen them? The young couple continue to elude authorities; if you see them, call 911 . Worried: Tammy Martin, Hayes' mother, said she worries what her son might do next . Fears: Sherry Peters also made a tearful plea for her daughter to return home to Kentucky . The sheriff said he believes Hayes is calling the shots as the teens try to stay ahead of the law. 'This is not a game to us,' Chaffins said. 'Our biggest fear is that Dalton is not going to stop for the police, he's going to run every time they approach him and they get in a pursuit. When a pursuit starts and somebody is not going to stop, the outcome is usually not a good one.' Their crime spree has drawn comparisons with the outlaws Bonnie and Clyde, who carried out robberies at banks and gas stations as they traveled across the U.S. in the 1930s. The story was made into a film starring Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty in 1967. Cheyenne was wearing a black, long-sleeve shirt and black sweatpants with brown and pink cowboy boots when she was caught on camera in South Carolina.

"Britain is sending bomb detection equipment used by troops in Afghanistan to soldiers fighting ISIS in Iraq, it has emerged. The move is said to be ‘softening the blow’ as the Government delays plans to send hundreds of troops to the Middle East - amid fears of further casualties in an election year. As David Cameron joined Barack Obama in talks in Washington yesterday, Pentagon sources were said to be furious that the UK appeared to be pulling back from its decision to deploy training teams to the region. Britain is to send bomb detection equipment used by troops in Afghanistan to soldiers fighting ISIS in Iraq. Pictured is a soldier from the Counter IED Task Force in Afghanistan searching for hidden Taliban bombs . Soldiers from the Counter IED Task Force in Helmand Province, Afghanistan searching for devices . In the next few weeks, the MoD will ship hundreds of the hand-held devices used to detect roadside bombs to Iraqi security forces trying to drive out ISIS militants from strongholds across the region. The counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Device) equipment became critical during the war in Afghanistan when the Taliban began laying the homemade bombs, killing hundreds of Allied soldiers. ISIS fanatics have started laying IEDs to take out Iraqi forces as part of a change in tactics to slow advances after UK airstrikes blasted their vehicles and killed their fighters. A defence source said: ‘This is what the Iraqis are most terrified of because they go out onto these roads and get blown up. It is destroying morale.’ Hundreds of highly sensitive detectors are expected to be sent to the region. As many as 800 will also be sent to Pakistan to help with the fight against the Taliban. Last year it emerged in a Defence Select Committee that the Iraqi government had asked the MoD to help with training the Army in counter-IED measures due to their specialist knowledge. ISIS fanatics (some pictured with guns) have started laying IEDs to take out Iraqi forces in the region . Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, then announced in December that hundreds of British troops would be sent to Iraq this month in a dramatic escalation of the war on terror. But the Ministry of Defence admitted there would be nowhere near that amount sent to the war-torn country within that timescale. Plans to train the Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi security threats to counter threats from roadside bombs were still being ‘scoped’, the MoD said earlier this month. A source told the Mail: ‘The Government are playing hot and cold with any decision to send more troops to Iraq before the election and it isn’t yet clear what is happening.’ They said counter-IED equipment would be sent in the meantime. The Defence Select Committee visited Iraq before Christmas and were greeted with appreciations from US and Iraqi forces for committing more troops to help fight IS. But news that the UK is delaying plans to commit trainers is said to have angered the Pentagon. ‘It is embarrassing – does the UK want to be seen as a mini-Denmark or do we want to be taken seriously’, a source added. This week the Germans announced they were sending 100 troops to the region, the French have sent an aircraft carrier and numerous other countries have deployed military assets. Downing Street are said to be worried about stepping up the UK’s military campaign in the Middle East . Downing Street are said to be worried that significantly stepping up the UK’s military campaign in the Middle East could influence the general election campaign. Senior officials apparently fear there would be a public backlash if serving UK soldiers were killed while training Iraqi security forces against jihadists. It comes after Mr Fallon announced that hundreds British service personnel would be training Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamist jihadists as soon as this month. A ‘force protection’ deployment of combat-ready soldiers was also expected to be sent to defend the military training teams, who would be based at four US bases inside Iraq, Mr Fallon said. The new mission would mark the first significant deployment of ground forces since the last British troops withdrew from Iraq three years ago. Soldiers were set to teach the Iraqi army vital skills, such as how to counter deadly roadside bombs. A handful of British trainers have already been deployed to Iraq to work with the Kurdish and Iraqi security forces. But the move signified Britain’s commitment to a ‘large-scale venture’ in which US-led training programmes are being rolled out to soldiers fighting against militants taking over swathes of the country. They were expected to join four large American training bases that are being established to train and advise the Iraqi army on a wider scale. An MOD spokesman said: 'As the Defence Secretary has said, as well as considering requests for further training to Iraqi forces and advisory personnel to Iraqi headquarters, the UK would consider requests for equipment or training as they are received.'","MoD to ship hundreds of devices used to detect roadside bombs to Iraq .

"Women who love to keep fit but work in a smart environment often face the dilemma of lugging their gym kit around the office. A scruffy sports bag slung over the shoulder on top of their handbag can detract from an otherwise elegant ensemble. One British woman with this exact issue came up with a solution, and partnered up with a bag designer to launch her range of so-called GymTotes. Scroll down for video . The Sophia bag, £120, is the latest style designed especially for yoga bunnies . Gym junkie Helena Searcaigh, alongside Nicola Kearney, came up with the idea for the chic faux leather handbags-come gym bags.

"A have-a-go hero stopped three louts who had stole a pensioner's mobility scooter but he had to let them go after police took an hour to arrive. Michael Lowe, 29, cornered the trio of joyriders in a passageway behind his home in Northenden, Manchester, just after midnight and asked his uncle to dial 999. One of them claimed the scooter belonged to his grandmother but when the charity volunteer shone a torch on it he saw it had been hot-wired and was covered in mud after being ridden in fields. Michael Lowe (left) cornered three louts who had made off with a mobility scooter while his uncle Neil Hodkin (right) called police. But police took an hour to arrive on the scene and in that time the men had esaped . He attempted to hold the men for as long as possible while his uncle, Neil Hodkin, 46, was on the phone to police, but they claim they took so long to respond that the group made off. Mr Lowe, who volunteers at stables to help disabled children ride horses, said: 'I tried to keep them for as long as I could but, in the end, they legged it into the fields. 'I could have given chase but I had to think of my own safety. My uncle couldn't help because he was being kept on the phone to the police. 'If they had come sooner they would have captured them.' Mr Hodkin said: 'I wanted to help my nephew but the call handler kept saying ""I just need some more details"". 'Call handlers are trained to do the best job they can but, frankly, that's not the point when you have individuals on the scene. The system's just not working.' After the louts ran off, the pair then began their own investigation, and found a second damaged scooter nearby and established that they belonged to next-door neighbours on another street. Mr Hodkin said: 'The police only turned up an hour later and they spoke to my nephew as if he had stolen them. I thought it was a disgraceful response. 'I think it's atrocious local youths have targeted elderly disabled people. It means they haven't got the means to get out and about. They're stranded. 'I think the response from the police was atrocious.' Inspector Luke Breakspear, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Police were initially called at 00.03am and the caller reported he could see youths driving a mobility scooter some way in the distance. One of the thugs claimed the scooter belonged to his grandmother but when Michael Lowe shone a torch on it he saw it had been hot-wired and was covered in mud after being ridden in fields (file picture) 'As with every 999 call, the call handler had to establish the exact details, location and circumstances of the incident in order to correctly prioritise the call and allocate the right officers to attend. 'This call lasted five minutes. At that time, the division was already dealing with two grade one incidents. 'Grade one incidents are given a higher priority as they relate to potential threats to people's lives so it is only right we allocate more resources to these critical jobs. 'This incident was therefore graded two and an officer was on scene at 1.02am, 59 minutes after the original call. 'I would also like to stress that the stolen mobility scooters were found and returned to their original owners that same night. 'However, if the caller does have any concerns about our response we would be more than happy to discuss them with him and address those concerns.'","Michael Lowe, 29, stopped the joyriders in a passageway behind his home .

"A police force grappling with budget cuts has teamed up with its fire and rescue service to create a squad car which doubles as a make-shift engine. The Rural Intervention Vehicle (RIV) will be used by a policeman and fireman at the same time, with officers tasked with patrolling Northamptonshire in search of dangerous situations or emergencies. Equipped with a foldable ladder and siren, the car has been hailed as a 'valuable' joint venture, and is said to be able to reach emergencies faster than large engines. Scroll down for video . The Rural Intervention Vehicle has been created in a joint venture between Northamptonshire Police and the local fire and rescue service following a series of budget cuts . While the RIV will never be sent to blazes in the place of specially-equipped vehicles, it will be used to assist fire fighters and assess potentially dangerous situations before they arrive. Speaking of the collaboration, Chief Superintendent Paul Fell said: 'The public are aware that all public services face significant financial challenges over the next few years, but this is genuinely about trying to provide a better service in a more cost-effective way to local communities.' District Commander Chief Inspector Dennis Murray said the scheme helped improve emergency services' 'accessibility' to the public. 'The jointly crewed vehicle has improved the visibility and accessibility of police and fire services in rural areas, as well as enhancing support to local people in areas such as crime and fire prevention and dealing with ongoing local problems.' The vehicle will be used to patrol the rural area and assess potentially dangerous situations . PC John Vjestica and Watch Manager Justin Abbott have been using the vehicle in a trial run across the area . Critics claimed the venture could put fire fighters at risk violent and unpleasant treatment by the public . While Northamptonshire Fire Service welcomed the project as a 'quicker, more comprehensive response' to danger, critics said it could risk putting fire fighters susceptible to crime. 'When a fireman turns up to a job he is always welcome, people know he is there to help. 'If they are associated with the police I'm afraid they will not be quite as welcome,' said Lib Dem Councillor Sally Beardsworth. Labour councillor John McGee added: 'Any proposed single authority or merger would be driven by cuts - and that's not good for the public.' Among tasks undertaken by the RIV in its trial period was visiting schools and community groups to deliver personal safety talks and advising local businesses and farms on hazard concerns.","The Rural Intervention Vehicle has been rolled out in Northamptonshire .

"Police will be interviewing hundreds of women in eastern Sydney who gave birth late last year amid a massive investigation to reveal the mother of the abandoned baby girl at Maroubra beach. Two nippers playing in the dunes found the heavily decomposed body buried under 30 cm of sand in late November 2014. Investigators are now using DNA samples from the baby in a bid to to identify the child and its parents, but they claim the best way of finding the mother is through the community, reports The Saturday Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Investigators are now using DNA samples from the baby in a bid to to identify the child and its parents . Detective Superintendent Gavin Dengate, commander of the eastern beaches area, said it is a huge task to investigating the birth records. 'Its is a big job obtaining medical records of pregnant women a couple of months either side of the discovery of the body,' he said. Investigators are currently focusing only on medical practices in the Maroubra region. DNA samples have recently been sent away for sampling, but Supt Dengate said it will be a long winded process. 'We are hoping to perhaps get a DNA profile but that will take some time. Once we have one we will try to match it with databases we're allowed to access,' he said. Supt Dengate said that the best chance of finding the child is through speaking with the community. DNA samples have recently been sent away for sampling, but Supt Dengate (right) said it will be a long winded process . 'We would ask anyone who may know something to contact police,' he said. 'It's a delicate matter and any information given to us will be treated accordingly.' He urges anyone with any information to come forward. The baby's remains remain at Glebe morgue. NSW Coroner's Court spokesman told the Saturday Telegraph 'If the parents are not ­located and an identity cannot be confirmed, the child will be given a state-funded funeral,' Locals in the Maroubra area were left shocked and saddened by the discovery of the baby's body. The naked baby was discovered by two members of the Under 7 Nippers team as they were digging in the sand dunes about 20 metres from the water's edge. The two boys, aged six and seven, found the 'very small' infant while digging in the sand during their weekly Sunday morning session at the southern end of Maroubra Beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Randwick councillor Brendan Roberts, who was at the scene with his son Oscar when the baby was found, told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'It was just such a contrast – everyone smiling and happy [and] this small little baby was just buried under our feet… it's a little bit stomach-turning.' The 'very small' infant was dug up about 50 metres away from the closest footpath leading off the beach . Lifeguards assisted police at the crime scene: Officers dressed in full protective gear and masks removed the body at about 1pm . Maroubra Surf Life Saving is providing counselling for the two boys who discovered the body, as well as other surf club members. The surf lifesaver also mentioned that the far south and north ends of the beach can be troublesome areas, saying that the lack of light or any kind of surveillance meant they attracted some questionable behaviour. It was difficult to determine how long the body had been buried due to the heat and location. The mayor of Randwick City Council, Ted Seng, said he was shocked and saddened to learn of the baby's discovery. 'To say that I'm shocked is an understatement. I cannot imagine the circumstances that lead to this tragic event. Our thoughts and the thoughts of the whole Randwick community are with this little lost soul and the family and loved ones.' Forensic investigators photographed the body which was protected from the heat by a large blue tarp .

"Labour peer and former lord chancellor Lord Falconer of Thoroton accepted his Assisted Dying Bill will run out of Parliamentary time after it was debated yesterday in the House of Lords . A controversial proposal giving some terminally ill patients the right to die will not become law before the election, supporters conceded last night. Labour peer and former lord chancellor Lord Falconer of Thoroton accepted his Assisted Dying Bill will run out of Parliamentary time after it was debated yesterday in the House of Lords. But supporters pledged to continue to fight for the Bill after the General Election. It would allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to any terminally-ill patient who wants to end their life and who is judged to have six months or less to live. It includes safeguards that give judicial oversight over the process. Under the proposals, two doctors would have to sign off the fatal dose. The proposal has provoked strident opposition from leading faith leaders and some doctors' organisations. David Cameron has repeatedly spoken against the plans - saying it could lead to people feeling 'unfairly pressurised' into ending their lives. Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in England and Wales, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Earlier this year Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem minister in charge of care for the elderly backed the change in the law on assisted dying. Britain's main faith leaders have rejected the plans, but the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said this year he supports the idea. Yesterday peers spent five hours of detailed discussion on the Bill's proposals, but completed only a handful of amendments. Dozens more would have to be dealt with before the Bill reaches the House of Commons and Lord Falconer accepted it would not get through its Commons stages. During the debate, former EastEnders star Lord Michael Cashman said he considered suicide after his long-term partner died last year. The Labour Peer, said he was 'absolutely clear that if my husband and partner was to die, I wanted to die with him.' He said his partner Paul Cottingham died of a 'very aggressive cancer' shortly before he joined the Lords. 'It came back very swiftly and his death was, I am certain, assisted.' Calling for clarity in dealing with assisted dying, he said: 'I was healthy but I wanted to commit suicide to end a healthy life.' David Cameron has repeatedly spoken against the plans - saying it could lead to people feeling 'unfairly pressurised' into ending their lives . Mr Cottingham was facing a death that could have happened in three days or three months, he said. 'To see him completely almost out of his senses because of the morphine but still aware that he was unable to breathe ... is for me clarity enough that I wanted to commit suicide and my husband who was dying needed his death accelerated.' Peers rejected a move to refer to the legislation as 'assisted suicide' instead of 'assisted dying' by a majority of 73. Lord Falconer said this was the first contested vote on his Bill and represented an 'overwhelming vote' in its favour. 'I'm very pleased with the way it has gone. The significance of the day is the vote in the Bill's favour.' He vowed to bring a similar Bill back after the election if he got the chance in the next Parliament. Ministers have repeatedly said the issue is for Parliament to decide with the Government remaining 'neutral'. Baroness Campbell of Surbiton, who has severe spinal muscular atrophy – a degenerative disease - warned the Bill was all about making law 'for the strong at the expense of the weak'. Speaking through a ventilator, Lady Campbell warned the current wording of the Bill was 'terribly open to misinterpretation and abuse', while reinforcing 'confusion' between terminal illness and disability. Several peers warned of the possibility of having 'doctors for hire' to certify applications for assisted dying. Sarah Wootton, chief executive of campaign group Dignity in Dying, said: 'We are now debating how, not if, we change the law on assisted dying for the terminally ill. 'This reflects the fact that most members of the House of Lords are now in agreement with the overwhelming majority of the public that the current law is unsustainable and cruel to those dying people suffering against their wishes at the end of life. She added: 'The clear and settled will of the public that the law needs to change is consistently evidenced by opinion polls.'","Plans to give terminally ill right to die will not become law before election .

"YouTube star Zoella, whose real name is Zoe Sugg, famously quit the internet in late 2014 after  it emerged that the editorial team at Penguin helped with the writing of her book. The 23-year-old's debut novel, Girl Online, broke the all-time record for highest first-week sales for a debut author, selling 78,109 copies in its first seven days but as rumours started to spread about a possible ghostwriter, Penguin confirmed that Sugg did not write Girl Online on her own. And now, her friend and fellow vlogger, Tanya Burr, is hoping for similar success as she prepares to publish her debut tome - but has already admitted she had help. Scroll down for video . Tanya Burr,  who already has her own fashion range for Very and cosmetics line, is releasing her debut book . Tanya, whose beauty and lifestyle videos garner millions of hits, will release Love, Tanya on January 29. Writing on her blog, the 25-year-old said: 'Books have always been a huge part of my life from a very young age. 'I started brainstorming ideas for a book that I thought my viewers would appreciate and I came up with the idea that is now Love, Tanya.' Tanya explains that she wanted to write a book that told a bit of her story - including things she has never shared before - without it ending up being an autobiography. It will be full of beauty, fashion, baking, love, friendship, the world of YouTube and just life in general, she promises. 'I also wanted to talk about my journey to becoming confident and happy about who I am, in the hope that it might help people reading it feel more confident and happy,' she said. Tanya  wanted to write a book that told a bit of her story without it ending up being an autobiography. The book, right, will be full of beauty, fashion, baking, love, friendship, the world of YouTube, she promises . Zoella's debut novel, Girl Online, broke the record for highest first-week sales for a debut author, selling 78,109 copies in its first week. But Penguin confirmed that Sugg did not write Girl Online on her own . But it wasn't all plain-sailing for Tanya, who admits that she had her idea rejected several times. 'I basically got together my book idea and took it round to lots of different publishers. Most said no, I guess there wasn't a gap in the market for this kind of book at the time,' she explains. 'However, after a few months I went back and tried again and a couple of publishers said they would like to publish my book. 'However, I had my heart set on Penguin, just because they were the main publishing house I had heard of growing up and I had read so many books by them. I just felt it would be so exciting to have my very own book published my them.' Tanya, who often sits front row at fashion week and is a regular on the London social circuit, is already planning big things for 2015 . The beauty blogger's dreams came true. Penguin got in touch and said that while her idea needed developing, they wanted to publish her musings. Clearly learning from Zoella's mistake, Tanya added: 'Penguin hired an amazing writer, Georgina Rodgers, to help me. Although I wanted to write the whole book myself, I knew it wasn't realistic with the time scale we had to work to. 'Georgina came over almost every day for a week and we just talked loads with a dictaphone running, I told her all about the chapters I had planned and she suggested new ones and we basically just brainstormed. Georgina then went home and transcribed our days of chatting and came up with a draft and structure for the book. I then spent all my time working on the text.' Tanya's £12.99 book isn't available for another few weeks but no doubt there are already plenty of pre-orders. It's no secret that the adolescents of today spend much of their time online and their daily influences can be found on the web. Dubbed The Internet Generation, there is little that young people can't consume online whether that's music, films or even books - entire lives can be stored on screen. And for a breed of youths dubbed vloggers, filming their daily musings and sharing them on YouTube has snowballed from an innocent hobby to a money-making machine. So successful have certain vloggers - including Tanya - become that they're taking the world of literature, beauty and television by storm. Indeed, research this week by Fudge to celebrate their sponsorship of London Collections: Men, which kicks off on Friday, discovered that men (not just teens) are increasingly turning to YouTube lifestyle gurus for inspiration over their favourite celebrities. Brit favourite Tanya, who lives in London, accumulates 10m views per month on her channel, has almost 2m subscribers and nearly a million Twitter followers. So influential is Tanya that she created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes that amassed the biggest waiting list that feelunique.com had ever witnessed when they went on sale. Speaking to MailOnline about her success, the 24-year-old said: 'I'm not entirely sure how my YouTube channel has become such a success, but I think it could be to do with my positive, friendly personality. 'I think the girls who watch my videos can relate to me as I'm not a traditional celebrity that seems unattainable, I'm still just a normal girl despite my large following. 'People say that when they watch my videos thy feel like I'm their friend and I love that. When I meet fans in the street I always feel like we could be best friends as we seem to always have lots in common which is lovely! Tanya created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes. When the products went on sale, they amassed the biggest waiting list that feelunique.com had ever witnessed . 'I think the world of YouTube is amazing in that you can feel like you're hanging out with your girlfriends just by watching a video. It's also incredible in that, if it wasn't for my YouTube channel, I wouldn't have started my own makeup line. 'I couldn't have done it without the support of my fans. I spent a year and a half developing my lip gloss and nail polish range and was involved every step of the way. 'I started with these products as I feel like lip gloss and nail polish are fun items of beauty as you can wear so many different colours and play around lots. 'I love the colours I designed so much and I named them after all of my favourite things and places. 'For example, I got engaged in New York, so I named one of the darker polishes New York Night and I love picnics so I named my favourite pretty pink gloss Picnic In The Park.'

"The reputation of music festivals as exhausting, if not exhilarating, events got a shake up this week as Soundwave Music Festival announced it's plan for an over-30's 'comfort zone' for weary revelers. While festivals might traditionally be associated with long days in the baking sun fueled by energy drinks and caffeine, this year's Soundwave will cater to its older demographic, providing must-needed respite in the form of bean bags, chilled beverages, and even remedial massage. In a move which sounds more in line with a red carpet than a moshpit, festival creator and promoter AJ Maddah announced the comfort zone after one of his Twitter followers suggested an 'oldies lounge' as a place to rest her legs. 'In the UK and in Europe most of the festivals have a two-day format, where people camp and if it all gets too much they can go and rest,' AJ told Daily Mail Australia.

AJ Maddah announced the comfort zone after one of his Twitter followers suggested an 'oldies lounge' as a place to rest her legs .

When Twitter user Jo, a mother and music lover, suggested an 'oldies lounge (shaded area with seats)' along with 'proof of age for entry' AJ jumped on the idea as a solution that would perfectly fit the direction he wanted the festival to move in. 'When she suggested it, it was a lightbulb moment. I just thought, let's do this. Let's create a really great space where people can get their breath back, grab a quality coffee or gelato, sit on bean bags and have all the comforts of home,' he said.

Jared Leto, 43, performing in 2011 at the Melbourne Soundwave Festival to a packed moshpit . The comfort zone is all set to have a massage therapist, a gelato bar, and a fine wine tasting bar, which AJ is hoping 'to serve in glassware'. 'It's going to be really civilised, I'm taking this very personally. I want people to feel like they're at home,' he said. Despite announcing the zone as initially for over 35's, and then for over 30's, AJ said the zone will only be restricted for those under 18. 'We don't want the space filling up with teenagers, but we're not going to enforce the age apart from that,' he said. 'A lot of people these days spend more time inside and just aren't used to a full day outside, and so this is also another way for us to adapt to our demographic.' Jo, who first suggested the idea and attends the festival with her partner, said that it came as a welcome surprise that her suggestion had been taken seriously. 'It's a full on day, and in previous years our bodies have been knackered afterwards. Soundwave is definitely an all-ages event, and Judas Priest has been playing for almost 50 years so it stands to reason that there are a lot of older fans,' Jo said. Billy Jo Armstrong, 42, and Mike Dirnt, 42, of punk band Green Day, performing in 2012 . The 2015 Soundwave was announced as a two-day festival, concerning some music lovers . Soundwave is definitely an all-ages event, and Judas Priest has been playing for almost 50 years so it stands to reason that there are a lot of older fans,' Jo said . 'They probably have fans who would love to come, but physically don't think they're up to a full day on their feet in the sun,' she said. Jo said that reports of brawls can often hurt the reputation of music festivals, which seem like they are 'for the young' and can put people off attending. The move was met with delight by many who had bought tickets to the Australian festival, who suggested many of the ideas that have now been introduced to the zone. 'Works for me I'm 51, act like I'm 21, with a sometimes a body of a 70 year old...Throw in a masseuse and I'm in,' said one Twitter user. At least one Twitter user was already clamboring to buy tickets for the 'reverse daycare but with amenities'. 'It's been years since I've done a festival without considering a nap, I'm only 30 now.' While no official pricing has been set, a preliminary estimate of $15 to $20 for tickets for the comfort zone was floated by AJ, who will be holding a planning meeting on Monday which he will live tweet . Despite announcing the zone as initially for over 35's, and then for over 30's, AJ said the zone will only be restricted for those under 18 . Jo said that while she always enjoys Soundwave, which she calls 'the highlight of her music year', and has found the festival to be well-run, clean, and friendly, she was glad to have somewhere to sit down and rest out of the sun. 'I would have been happy with shade and seats.  But a dedicated bar, tables to eat at, an upmarket toilet are all good. And if someone wants to massage us while we're there, we'll they're more than welcome,' Jo said. While no official pricing has been set, a preliminary estimate of $15 to $20 for tickets for the comfort zone was floated by AJ, who will be holding a planning meeting on Monday which he will live tweet. 'At the end of the day we want people to get the most out of their experience. It's a pretty hectic day and that's another reason for people to have an oasis to run away to,' he said. 'We don't have any filler bands, so the line up is stellar, and we want to give people somewhere they can recharge which helps them get back out there,' he said.","Australian music festival Soundwave has announced new 'comfort zone'

"A picture of Ciaran Goggins wearing a t-shirt with an image of Ched Evans and the words '100 per cent innocent' appeared on the Justice for Ched site . A 'true friend' of Ched Evans who has worked 'closely' with the campaign to clear his name has made abusive comments about his victim and posted a link to the website that named her. Ciaran Goggins made derogatory comments and allegations about the convicted rapist's victim, describing her as a 'false rape accuser' who was unhappy as she did not get a 'big win' and a pink MINI. He was arrested after tweeting a link to the website which named the disgraced footballer's victim – despite the fact that she is legally entitled to lifelong anonymity. The Twitter troll has long been a supporter of the Justice for Ched campaign and insisted that the former Sheffield United striker's two-and-a-half year jail term was a miscarriage of justice. A picture of Goggins wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo 'Ched Evans is innocent' was displayed on the campaign site with the caption: 'a True Friend and Supporter'. But the site has now distanced itself from Goggins, saying his comments were 'unreasonable and unpalatable' and subsequently removing his image from the site. In one blog post in October last year, Goggins wrote: 'It seems that the false rape accuser of Ched Evans is unhappy. She did not get much of a 'big win' and no Pink Mini either. 'What she did get was a relocation package by the North Wales police vermin paid for by the UK taxpayer.' Evans was released from prison last year after being found guilty of raping a drunk woman in a hotel in Wales in 2011, but he has continued to maintain his innocence. The former Sheffield United striker finally issued an apology to his victim earlier this month and condemned the online abuse that has been aimed at her ever since his conviction in April 2012. Ched Evans issued an apology to his victim earlier this month and condemned the online abuse that has been aimed at her ever since his conviction in April 2012, pictured with his girlfriend Natasha Massey . A post on Ciaran Goggins's blog described the convicted rapist's victim as a 'false rape accuser' 'It has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine,' the statement said. 'I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely.' Goggins took to his blog yesterday and wrote: 'After years of working closely together I am now leaving the 'Justice for Ched' campaign to concentrate on other issues. 'Ched Evans was subject of a miscarriage of justice - I feel that with his new legal team under Shaun Draycott he will be exonerated.' In 2012 Goggins, who is a resident in Ireland, was one of 19 people arrested and questioned by North Wales police on suspicion of naming Evans's victim on social media. Ten were subsequently charged and convicted, including Gemma Thomas, Evans' cousin. No charges were brought against Goggins, but The Guardian reported that he was questioned for 72 hours and his ex-girlfriend's computer and his UK and Ireland mobile phones were seized. The former striker was released from prison last year after being found guilty of raping a drunk woman in a hotel in Wales in 2011 . He was released without charge. A spokesman for the Justice for Ched site said Goggins was a 'vocal' supporter of Evans' claim to have been wrongly convicted, and they only 'very recently' became aware of his social media comments. 'Up until we were aware of his derogatory comments last week, we viewed him as a conscientious supporter of Ched,' a spokesman said. 'When we understood some of the tweets were totally unreasonable and unpalatable his image was removed from the site. 'To be clear we have now cut all communication with Ciaran Goggins or anyone who purports to be Ciaran Goggins and will not interact with anyone who uses social media to attack anyone. 'Ched does not in any way support the negative use of social media by anyone whether they claim to be his friends or supporters or not.' The website itself,  has set out a partial account of Evans’s trial, is currently under investigation by the Attorney General, whose office is considering whether it is in contempt of court. Evans could face  a further 14 months out of football if he continues his fight to clear his name. A deal for the disgraced footballer l to sign for Oldham Athletic collapsed at the last minute earlier this month. This is the fourth club to turn down the chance to sign the former Wales and Sheffield United striker after his release from jail last October, halfway through a five-year sentence. Goggins has also written abusive comments about Jean Hatchett, who was behind the online petition to stop the 26-year-old returning to his former club, which collected more than 160,000 signatures.","Ciaran Goggins made abusive comments about Ched Evans's victim .

"Muhammad Ali was released from hospital on Friday ahead of his 73th birthday celebrations . Muhammad Ali has been released from hospital and is in good spirits ahead of his birthday on Saturday. A spokesman for the champion boxer said that he 'looks forward to celebrating his 73rd birthday tomorrow'. Ali had been admitted to hospital for the second time in four weeks after he was found in an unresponsive state by guests staying at his Scottsdale, Arizona home. The former champion boxer needed follow-up care related to the severe urinary tract infection he was hospitalized with on December 20. 'There were still issues with the urinary tract infection,' spokesman Bob Gunnell said of Ali's latest hospitalization. The three-time world heavyweight champion was now heading home to celebrate his 73rd birthday on January 17 with his family and friends. 'My daddy is a strong man. He's so resilient and we're all very grateful and blessed,' daughter Rasheda Ali-Walsh, one of his nine children, said earlier this week. Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, was diagnosed with the brain disease about three years after he retired from boxing in 1981. Ali's public appearances have diminished in recent years as he continues to battle Parkinson's disease, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends. Ali appeared in public in September at a ceremony in his hometown of Louisville for the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards. He did not speak to the crowd but posed for photos with award winners, including former NFL great Jim Brown. Brown leaned over and whispered to the seated Ali during the photo session. Later, Brown said he told Ali: 'You're the greatest of all time.' Ali and his wife, Lonnie, have homes in Paradise Valley, Arizona; Berrien Springs, Michigan; and in Louisville.

"With the average house price in England rocketing to £279,000, getting on the property ladder can feel out of reach for many. But for the same price as a studio flat in Balham, south London, a potential buyer could snap up a Victorian pub that comes complete with a huge bar, function room and 21 bedrooms. The historic grade II listed Fleece Hotel in Richmond, Yorkshire, has gone up for sale for the guide price of £250,000 pounds after it closed suddenly earlier this month. The historic grade II listed Fleece Hotel in Richmond, Yorkshire, has gone up for sale for the guide price of £250,000 . However, the new owners will have to spend some time and hard work bringing the accommodation up to modern standards, with the hotel rooms not thought to have been used for over 20 years. The pub was briefly renamed Tanya's Charms in honour of local resident Tanya Robinson, now Tanya Bardsley, who won the FHM High Street Honeys competition . The sale of the pub, which covers 9,200 square feet and dates back more than 100 years, comes as a flat in London's exclusive Knightsbridge has gone on the market for an eye watering £3 million. 'We don't think the rooms have been used for 20 to 30 years and would need extensive renovation,' said Sam Frankland of estate agents CBRE. 'But we think it would make a great small hotel.' The four-storey, grade II-listed building includes a large bar, kitchen, cellar, stores and upstairs function room. The pub is owned by Stonegate Pub Company, which runs more than 600 venues across the UK. The striking building was built by renowned Darlington architect George Gordon Hoskins in 1897.

"A family firm which made iconic sheepskin coats for Del Boy and footballer commentator John 'Motty' Motson is closing down tomorrow after 169 years because of falling sales. Nursey and Son, based in Bungay, Suffolk, has also sold coats to Eric Clapton and ITV presenter Holly Willoughby over the years and is one of the UK's oldest sheepskin specialists. Actor David Jason, who played Del Boy Trotter in the classic BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses, even had one specially made after falling in love with the coat he wore on screen. Nursey and Son custom made a sheepskin coat for actor David Jason, who played Del Boy Trotter (left), and sold one to commentator John 'Motty' Motson (right) But the company, which has been making luxurious garments since 1846, was forced to shut last March after plummeting profits and falling sales plunged it into crisis. It has been run by the same family for generations and employed more than 80 staff at its peak in 1970s. But recently it only employed seven people and had not made a profit in six years. The firm reopened in October to sell off remaining stock but tomorrow marks the final day for the Victorian powerhouse. Managing director Tim Nursey, 65, who was handed the reins in the 1970s by his father Samuel Burton Nursey, said he had battled to come to terms with closing the historic business. 'I'm fully adjusted to it now. I had to really make the decision in my own mind. It is a time of change. In our heyday we supplied hundreds of men's outfitters and ladies dress shops across Britain and northern Europe. Managing director Tim Nursey (pictured), 65, who was handed the reins in the 1970s by his father Samuel Burton Nursey (in the photo), said he had battled to come to terms with closing the historic business . Pictured is (L-R): William Pipe, Tim's great grandfather Samuel James Nursey, Tim's grandfather Samuel Parker Nursey in the 1900s . 'Most have shut down and that filtered down to us. Fashion is changing and the weather isn't as cold as it was.' Mr Nursey started training at the business when he was 18 and is the fifth generation of his family to run the enterprise. 'The last eight of us played football and cricket together when we were young and several people had been with us for 40 years. 'We had all been young together and we had all got older together,' said Mr Nursey.

They must have looked at us and realised if they were going to overcome that and expand the business they would need a huge amount of money.' Nursey and Son used the highest quality toscana and merino lambskin as well as Italian leather to make coats, gilets, slippers, gloves and hats alongside many other products. Mr Nursey said he counted a visit from Princess Anne in the 1990s as one of his highlights, along with being named the Countryside Alliance's British champions in the traditional business category in 2010. Limited stock is left and Mr Nursey said there had been some interest in selling the brand name for exclusivity in Japan. He also aims to launch a property rental company letting warehouse and office space in the building. 'The name Nursey and Son will continue in the town hopefully for generations. People have been very kind - many were shocked and sad to see us closing,' said Mr Nursey. 'To come to a shop where nearly everything was made on the premises is extremely rare.

"As far as things to do with your children, it's certainly not the most common activity. But a mother-of-one has defend her decision to pole dance with her two-year-old daughter, saying she is an advocate of attachment parenting. Ashley Wright, from California, US, posted a video on Facebook of herself performing on her pole while holding Shannon Marie, which has now been viewed more than 500,000 times. The three-minute footage starts with Ashley, dressed in skimpy black underwear, spinning around the pole as her toddler wanders into the room, holding her hands towards her. Ashley can then be seen picking up her young child and resumes spinning round the pole with the toddler clasped in her arms. Later in the routine, the mother seductively writhe around on the floor as Shannon Marie appears totally entertained and attempts to join in. Mother Ashley can be seen pole dancing in the video as an amused Shannon Marie looks on . Ashley perfects her moves with Shannon Marie attempts to copy her . Ashley says she is an extreme advocate of attachment parenting - a style intended to create a very empathetic and nurtured child. Some of the hallmarks of attachment parenting are co-sleeping with the entire family and babywearing (where an infant is worn in a sling). Ashley said she hasn't been shocked by the negative reaction she has received and claims her dancing demonstrated a strong mother-daughter bond. 'It is no surprise that many are put off, and even more confused by this shared display of divine femininity, sensual acceptance, power and open, unapologetic, love for self and for my child,' she said. Ashley is an advocate of attachment parenting characteristics include babywearing (pictured) Ashley is often pictured practising acrobatics with her daughter . 'Unfortunately, many did not receive nor have bared witness to this form of love and therefore only see what is they can connect with; shame.' Nearly 5,000 people have commented on the video. Johanna Marie wrote: 'It looked like the baby was reaching up for mommy but she's to busy dancing on the pole with her undergarments.' Jo-Ann Sagat added: 'Nothing wrong with pole dancing but not when you should be spending time with your child... do it when the child is in bed...that is NOT the time to be doing it.'

And Kyralee Swann said: 'How about teaching your daughter to read or count or spell, instill qualities in her that will make her bright and successful? 'Instead of instilling skills in her that will only benefit her if she needs to degrade herself for money.' On her website Ms Wright's Way, she writes: 'It is okay to be 100 per cent committed to your child(ren) and loved ones. In doing so make sure that you take the time to give to yourself. 'Get your hair done, go to a game, practice the yoga, take the zumba class, because if you don’t continue to give to yourself you compromise the quality of care for others.'","Ashley Wright filmed herself pole-dancing with her toddler .

"Christopher Taylor drowned after the emergency dispatcher missed the alert and the control room supervisor admitted he may have been distracted . A student drowned after paramedics and police were delayed when two 999 operators missed the emergency call, an inquest heard. Christopher Taylor had been spotted desperately clinging onto a branch after falling into the River Avon in Bath last January. A passerby called 999 but by the time emergency services reached the scene the sporty 21-year-old had disappeared in the freezing river. The inquest heard there had been an unexplained  delay between the time of the call and when police officers and paramedics were sent to the scene. An emergency dispatcher admitted she had missed the alert while the control room supervisor claimed he may have been distracted doing admin. Christopher had been celebrating the end of his exams with friends when he fell into the river at 4am last January. An underwater search team retrieved his body from the River Avon in the centre of Bath, Somerset, downstream later that day. Coroner Maria Voisin questioned why there had been the unexplained five minute delay. The two control room staff responsible for dispatching officers said they did not know why they didn't respond straight away. Supervising emergency officer dispatcher Pete Jennings said he did not see the emergency flashing on his screen as he may have been doing paperwork at the time. He said: 'I really cannot explain it or recall what I was doing at the time.' Emergency dispatcher Hayley Deacon added that she did not immediately see it on her computer screen because she may have been dealing with another incident. She said: 'I really cannot recall what I was doing, and why I did not see the emergency light flashing.' The sporty 21-year-old had been celebrating the end of exams with frends when he slipped to his death into the River Avon (pictured) in the centre of Bath, Somerset . Talented Christopher, who was a keen tennis player, was studying Chemistry at the University of Bath when he went out in the city on January 23. Just weeks before his death he had posted a Facebook message about having the 'best year ever' with his girlfriend Jessica Palmer, 20. He wrote: 'Well, that’s 2013 done and dusted...and as gay as it sounds, I’ve had the best year ever with my Jessica Palmer...I love you.' Chris also posted happy pictures of himself in a tuxedo with Jessica in front of a Christmas tree and more pictures of themselves on a weekend trip to Bristol. Passerby Luke Thompson had spotted Christopher, who was showing signs of hypothermia, desperately clinging on to the branch and dialled 999. Mr Thompson told the inquest he was conscious and calling for help when he noticed the student. He said: 'I was on the phone to a friend when I heard someone calling from the river, he was calling for help. 'I immediately got off the phone and ran to where he was. I called 999 and tried to get closer. 'There was a huge drop of about 10 or 12 feet, and the victim was holding on to a branch or something to keep him up. 'I tried to keep him talking while we waited for the police to arrive. 'He told me he had fallen in the river and he desperately needed to get out.' Mr Thompson told the inquest there were lots of trees and bushes where the student had fallen in, and it was impossible for him to get out. By the time police and paramedics reached the scene Christopher - who was showing signs of hypothermia - had disappeared in the swollen river . He said the second year student was fighting for his life but as time passed he got weaker and his speech became slurred. By the time police and paramedics arrived at the scene, Christopher had already gone under the water, Mr Thompson called the court. Christopher's friend Matthew Learoyd (corr) said in a statement the group had a few drinks, but his friend was not a heavy drinker and was not very drunk. A post mortem revealed the levels of alcohol found was not 'serious or severe', but could have affected co-ordination and slow down reaction. At the time of his death, Christopher's grieving family, from Southport, Lancashire, paid tribute to him as 'a wonderful son and brother'. In a statement they said: 'Chris was a talented sportsman who lit up every room he walked into. 'His death has left us completely devastated.' Christopher was the fourth drowning in Bath in recent years. Last year, an 850-yard fence was installed along a stretch of the river to improve water safety. The fencing was one of the recommendations of a safety review carried out following the tragedies. The inquest at Flax Bourton, Somerset continues.","Christopher Taylor fell into the swollen River Avon in Bath last January .

"Devoted parents Zara Phillips MBE and Mike Tindall are pulling out all the stops for their daughter's first birthday. Mia Grace Tindall, the youngest member of the royal family who is 16th in line to the throne, turns one on Saturday. And her father Mike, 36, who is currently in training for an appearance on Channel 4 reality show The Jump, is taking a break from filming in Austria to fly home for the occasion. Scroll down for video . Zara Phillips and daughter Mia out for a walk in Sydney, Australia last month (l). The pair will be home for her birthday, and father Mike Tindall (r) will join them as he takes a break from filming TV show The Jump for the occasion . Zara spoke about Mia's birthday at an event in Australia last week: '[I've] got to go home first and then see what happens.' Meanwhile Zara, 33, who has been in Australia for the past few weeks, said at an event that she'd soon figure out the plan for Mia's special day just as soon as she gets back. Speaking with Daily Mail Australia at the Magic Millions Race Day on Saturday, Zara said: '[I've] got to go home first and then see what happens.' Olympic silver-medal winner Zara shared that she couldn't be more thrilled about the past 12 months of motherhood. 'It's gone so quickly,' she said. Mother-of-one Zara said that little Mia loves playing with fellow royal youngsters Prince George and her cousins Savannah and Isla. 'We've all got small ones now,' she said. 'So it's great fun.' Zara has become known for her no-nonsense, multitasking mothering style; and is almost always seen taking her daughter with her wherever she goes. Zara takes motherhood in her stride as she feeds Mia while catching up on the phone (l). The eventer almost always brings Mia out with her . Olympic silver-medal winner Zara shared that she couldn't be more thrilled about the past 12 months of motherhood . Zara, who is set to return to Australia every year until 2018, said: 'It's going to be great to come back down every year and get a bit of sunshine.' A well-respected  eventer, Zara has built up a successful racing business and has even trained racehorses for her mother, the Princess Royal. As a result, Mia has become a regular sight on the racecourse, although her father Mike Tindall seems to prefer spending his Sundays at home.

Zara pushes the stroller at the Hambledon Horse Trials in Oxfordshire in April. Zara Tindall had returned to competition for the first time following the birth of her daughter, and husband Mike was there to help out. She competed in dressage, show jumping and cross country . First-time father Mike is clearly enjoying being a parent to his 'very chilled' baby. According to the rugby player, Mia, who does not have a nanny, spends much of her time travelling with her mother. 'She stays in the truck [horsebox] with her,' said Tindall, who was speaking to the Times newspaper. 'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. You are going to travel around a lot. Mike seen taking on father duties while walking the dogs - quite the multitasker himself (l) and hands-on parents Zara and Mike out with Mia (r) Despite both parents' sporting success, Tindall says he doesn't expect his daughter to go on to a rugby or eventing career of her own but says the couple already have three Shetland ponies waiting for her. 'Ideally, I don't think we would have her on a horse or a rugby pitch but she might make her own decision and then you have just got to support it. 'I don't think we'll ever keep her away from horses. We've got three Shetland ponies waiting for her. 'If it's death-defying feats she wants to do, you have to get your head round it and support her, and if she wants to study and be a nuclear physicist, you do that as well.' But with a mother aiming for gold at Rio 2015 and a father who is about to risk life and limb attempting ski jumps on a reality TV show, the former probably awaits for little Mia.

Mia came out with Zara at every occasion as fellow attendees cooed over the baby, dressed in adorable outfits . Zara gave birth to Mia on January 17 2014. The baby weighed 7lb 12oz girl, and is the Queen's fourth great-grandchild. Father Mike took to Twitter after the birth to describe his joy at becoming a father for the first time, saying it was 'definitely the best day of my life'. A few days later, Mike also announced Mia's name on the social networking site. The couple had predicted they would take some time to come up with a name because they had chosen not to be told the sex of their child in advance. Zara, who is one of Britain's leading equestrian riders, gave birth to her first child at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital with her husband at her side. She is the daughter of Princess Anne, but does not hold a royal title after her mother decided not to pass on her status to her children. Mia Grace does not hold any royal or aristocratic title. When Zara herself was born, her name was likewise a break from tradition as it had no precedent in the royal family. Zara and Tindall first met in a Sydney bar when he was in Australia for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. They married in July 2011 in Edinburgh at a ceremony attended by the Queen and senior royals. They moved back to Anne's Gatcombe Park estate last January after selling their regency home in Cheltenham.

"She may be taller than the average woman at 5ft 8in but the Duchess of York looked minuscule as she posed for a selfie with two of her biggest fans in New York yesterday. Prince Andrew's former wife was stopped by identical twins Mike and Ray, who rap under the name the Filthy Brothers and The Twin Towers, outside the studios of radio station SiriusXM in uptown Manhattan and smiled as one of her admirers took an opportunistic photo. The rappers later posted a picture of them and the Duchess on their own Twitter account. Wearing a black trench coat, sunglasses, black tights, and black flat shoes, the duchess seemed content to be out and about in a city which has become a second home to her in recent months. Scroll down for video . Her biggest fans: Prince Andrew's former wife, the Duchess of York, was stopped by the two towering men outside the studio of radio station SiriusXM in uptown Manhattan . The Filthy brothers were quick to publish a picture of them and the Duchess of York on their Twitter account . Known in the US by her maiden name Sarah Ferguson, she has been a regular face in the city since her daughter Princess Eugenie landed a job at New York-based online art auction house, Paddle8, in September. This week, she appeared on American television promoting her soup diet while also speaking up in defence of former husband Prince Andrew following lurid claims he slept with an underage sex slave. Yesterday the duchess was facing criticism after linking a top university to her controversial diet plan while she was endorsing it on American television. Ms Ferguson claims to have lost 4st thanks to a £65 blender which turns fruit and vegetables into smoothies and soup. In an interview promoting the product on morning TV, she said that she had been motivated to help beat obesity by her work with Imperial College London, one of the world's most prestigious scientific institutions. Second home: Sarah Ferguson has become a regular in the city since her daughter Princess Eugenie landed a job at New York-based online art auction house, Paddle8, in September . But the university has been quick to distance itself from the duchess' claims - saying that her commercial projects 'are not connected in any way' to its research, The Times reported. Experts said they were sceptical about the benefits of her diet plan, casting doubt on the nutritional benefits claimed to come from using the 'emulsifier' which she has promoted in a half-hour 'infomercial' as well as in multiple TV interviews. The duchess has been outspoken about her battle with her weight since divorcing her husband in 1996 and is said to have been paid £1.4million a year as the face of Weight Watchers. Ms Ferguson also spoke up in defence of ex-husband Prince Andrew, describing him as a 'humongously good man' and 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever'. Controversy: The Duchess of York is endorsing the Fusion Xcelerator, a blender and diet plan . The Prince has come under fire over his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with an underage girl. Buckingham Palace has issued a statement strongly denying the allegations, which Ms Ferguson, 55, repeated during an interview with NBC News. 'I won't stand by - because I know what it feels like to have salacious lies made up about you - and not support him so publicly,' she told Matt Lauer. Adamant: Sarah Ferguson passionately defended her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, as she appeared on the Today show on Tuesday morning . She said the claims against her former husband were 'shockingly accusatory allegations which I don't think are right'. 'I won't stand by and have his character defamed,' she said. 'I will not have one word said about him on any level. Any level.' The pair, who divorced in 1996 after 10 years of marriage, remain good friends, she said. They have two daughters together, Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24.","Duchess stopped by giant fans outside SiriusXM studios in Manhattan .

"A new species of legless amphibian resembling a giant earthworm or a snake has been discovered in a remote but threatened area of Cambodian rainforest. The grey-brown creature, called Ichthyophis cardamomensis, was found in Cambodia's southwest Cardamom Mountains, an area under threat from habitat loss, according to Fauna and Flora International (FFI). The new species is often mistaken for a snake, with larger species known to grow up to 1.5 metres (nearly five feet) in length, FFI said. Ichthyophis cardamomensis was found in Cambodia's southwest Cardamom Mountains, an area under threat from habitat loss . The creature is caecilian -- an order of amphibians that look like snakes or earthworms and are generally found underground. Caecilians are best described as snake or worm-like amphibians that lack limbs. They have the typical amphibian skin that clearly differs from snakes, and they have skull and bones which differs from worms. It was confirmed by scientists earlier this month according to leading Cambodian FFI herpetologist Neang Thy. 'These discoveries are important to demonstrate that much of Cambodia's biodiversity remains unknown and unstudied by science, and many more areas need to be searched,' Thy, who has been researching amphibians and reptiles since 2003, told AFP. The creature is caecilian -- an order of amphibians that look like snakes or earthworms and are generally found underground. Once a stronghold of the toppled Khmer Rouge regime, the bio-diverse Cardamom Mountains are home to an array of rare species, including the Asian elephant, but the area faces widespread deforestation. Conservationists warn that illegal logging and other habitat destruction could mean new species become extinct shortly after discovery. The forested Cardamom Mountains Range represents some of the largest remaining areas of habitat for more than 80 threatened species, including Asian elephant and gaur. Thy said in recent years the Cardamom region had revealed its extensive reptile and amphibian diversity, including frogs, turtles, lizards and crocodiles. 'We are still learning about this area and the animals in it, since it was a region formerly held by the Khmer Rouge and the mountains were closed to researchers until the 1990s,' he said. The creature is caecilian -- an order of amphibians that look like snakes or earthworms and are generally found underground. While some caecilian species can grow to 1.5m, this Ichthyophis cardamomensis was only 30cm. Credit: Neang Thy/FFI . 'The Cardamom region it is under threat from logging, land concessions, and other habitat destruction, and the danger of any new species, including the new caecilian, is that they may be discovered one year and go extinct the next.' Caecilians have a valuable role in the ecosystems of tropical and subtropical regions, including providinga food source for the red tailed pipe snake (Cylindrophis ruffus). Caecilians eat invertebrates, such as earthworms, ants and termites.","Ichthyophis cardamomensis was found in Cambodia's southwest Cardamom Mountains, an area under threat from habitat loss .

"For all those whose New Years resolution was to travel more, you're in luck. This month, hotel prices in key European destinations have fallen dramatically - in some cases, reaching their lowest in the past four years. This includes such popular cities as Rome, Berlin, Barcelona and Nordic destinations, like Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo. This month, hotel prices in key European destinations, like Rome (pictured), have fallen dramatically . According to the trivago Hotel Price Index (tHPI), which is reported monthly, 21 of the 50 most popular European cities are at a record low. A hotel stay in Rome during the month of January could cost as little as £78 per night, while Berlin is even cheaper, coming in at just £68 for a room per night. And while some destinations are currently boasting their lowest hotel prices in four years, many more are also seeing their lowest prices in the past 12 months. When prices for this month are compared to the most expensive month of 2014, savings of up to 60 per cent are available in some places. Reaching its lowest price in months, a hotel room in Berlin costs as little as £68 in January . Among those cities with the biggest drop in price are Edinburgh, Venice and Barcelona . In Barcelona, a hotel room will run just £72 this month, compared to a hefty £131 price tag in May 2014 . Out of the 50 most popular destinations in Europe on trivago, Edinburgh and Venice offer the greatest percentage difference this month. Usually considered one of the most expensive cities in Europe, a hotel in Venice will cost just £97 this month, compared to £231 in May 2014. This massive difference in both month-on-month and -year-on-year costs suggests a general trend of falling hotel prices. Of the 50 most popular European destinations on trivago, Edinburgh offers the greatest price difference: 60% . 17 of 22 popular European cities have seen a price drop when compared to January 2014 costs . Usually considered to be one of the most expensive cities, a hotel in Venice ranks at just £97 this month . The lowest month-on-month decreases can be found in Dresden, Prague and London, while the largest year-on-year decreases will benefit those looking to travel to Riga, Warsaw and Bucharest. In fact, Prague has experienced a 20 per cent drop compared to last month and 14 per cent compared to last year, making it the prime time to visit. Denise Bartlett, of trivago's UK Public Relations says: 'January is always a cheap month for European hotel stays, with temperatures at their lowest in many locations and prices falling after the Christmas and New Year period. 'However, with both year-on-year decreases and many destinations at their lowest in four years, a general trend of falling hotel prices is extremely likely. 'Large savings can be made by travelling this month – some of the destinations at their lowest since January 2011 are typically among the most expensive in Europe - Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo, for example.'","Hotel costs in European destinations have fallen dramatically this month .

"The head of US intelligence has revealed he was treated to a lavish 12-course meal by the North Korean general believed to be responsible for hacking Hollywood studio Sony during a secret mission to Pyongyang - and was then presented with the bill. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper gave a riveting account of the visit at a New York conference on cybersecurity, just days after the government imposed new sanctions on North Korea in retaliation for the late November attack. He said it was 'the most serious cyber attack ever made against US interests' and could potentially cost hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. Scroll down for video . Director of National Intelligence James Clapper gave a riveting account of a secret mission he went on to North Korea last November, where he was asked to pay for a lavish meal his hosts cooked for him . He said that on November 7, the first night of his mission to free two Americans, he dined with General Kim, 'in charge of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the RGB, who's the organization responsible for overseeing the attack against Sony.' Clapper did not give the general's full name but he apparently was referring to General Kim Yong-chol, director of the RGB, also known as Unit 586, one of three North Korean entities sanctioned by the United States in response to the Sony hack. Clapper called the elaborate, 12-course repast 'one of the best Korean meals I've ever had' but said the four-star general spent most of the time berating him about American aggression 'and what terrible people we were.' 'All the vitriol that he spewed in my direction over dinner was real,' Clapper said. 'They really do believe they are under siege from all directions and painting us as an enemy that is about to invade their country every day is one of the chief propaganda elements that's held North Korea together.' He said the pair communicated through a North Korean translator who spoke fluent English 'with a British accent, which was kind of strange.' Kim kept 'pointing his finger at my chest and saying the US and South Korean exercise was a provocation to war and of course not being a diplomat, my reaction was to lean back across the table and point my finger at his chest.' At one point, his assistant suggested Clapper take a 'head break' to ease the tension. At the end, Clapper was presented with the bill, according to the Washington Post - though he didn't disclose how much it was for, or whether service was included. As the plates were cleared away he said he presented Kim with a letter from President Barack Obama, designating Clapper as his envoy and saying that the release of the two US citizens would be viewed as a positive gesture. He admitted the next day was 'kind of nerve-racking' and that he was not sure if they would get the two Americans back or not.

Movie-goers wait in line outside the Los Feliz 3 Cinema in Los Angeles, California on December 25, to purchase tickets for  the The Interview . Hackers attacked Sony Pictures and threatened the company over the looming Christmas release of the comedy film The Interview, which depicts a fictional CIA plot to kill North Korea's leader . At one point an emissary came to say North Korea no longer considered him a presidential envoy and as such could not guarantee his safety. But in the afternoon, they were taken to a hotel for an 'amnesty-granting ceremony' where the two Americans, still in prison garb, were handed over. Afterward they headed straight to the airport and took off, he said. 'I can't recall a time when that aircraft with United States of America emblazed across it ever looked as good,' he joked. Clapper, who spent less than 24 hours in North Korea, said the first thing that struck him on arrival was how dark the city and airport were, and how the plane damaged a tire while taxiing because of poor runway construction. He said people labored with old-fashioned tools and were eerily going about their business dressed in drab clothes. 'It was kind of creepy about how impassive everyone was. They didn't show any emotion, didn't stop to greet each other... I didn't see anyone conversing or laughing,' he said. Hackers attacked Sony Pictures in late November and threatened the company over the looming Christmas release of the comedy film The Interview, which depicts a fictional CIA plot to kill North Korea's leader. The threats led worried movie theater owners to drop the film and then Sony cancelled the public debut altogether, before releasing it online. The FBI said North Korea was behind the Sony intrusion. Pyongyang repeatedly denied involvement but has applauded the actions of the shadowy hacking group. 'They are deadly, deadly serious, no pun intended, about affronts to the supreme leader, whom they consider to be a deity,' Clapper said Wednesday. 'I watched The Interview over the weekend and it's obvious to me that North Koreans don't have a sense of humor.' Sony said Tuesday that the film has been its best-grossing online film, making more than $31 million on the Internet and other small-screen formats.

"Penn State is getting back 112 wins wiped out during the Jerry Sandusky child molestation scandal and the late Joe Paterno has been restored as the 'winningest coach' in major college football history. The National Collegiate Athletic Association announced the new settlement with the school weeks before a scheduled trial on the legality of the 2012 consent decree it will replace. The new deal also directs a $60 million fine to address child abuse be spent within Pennsylvania and resolves that lawsuit. Scroll down for video . Penn State is getting back 112 wins wiped out during the Jerry Sandusky child molestation scandal and the late Joe Paterno (pictured) has been restored as the 'winningest coach' in college football history . The NCAA board of governors approved the settlement, said association spokesman Bob Williams. The Penn State board approved it Friday afternoon. The announcement follows the NCAA's decision last year to reinstate the school's full complement of football scholarships and let Penn State participate in post-season play, and comes just days after a federal judge declined to rule on the consent decree's constitutionality. The NCAA said continuing the litigation would only delay the distribution of funds to sex abuse survivors. 'While others will focus on the return of wins, our top priority is on protecting, educating and nurturing young people,' said Harris Pastides, University of South Carolina president and member of the NCAA board. The consent decree sprung from the scandal that erupted when Sandusky, a retired football assistant coach, was accused of sexually abusing boys, some of them on Penn State's campus. It had eliminated all wins from 1998 - when police investigated a mother's complaint that Sandusky had showered with her son - through 2011, Paterno's final season as head coach after six decades with the team and the year Sandusky was charged. In September, the NCAA announced it was ending the school's ban on post-season play and restored its full complement of football scholarships earlier than scheduled. The restored wins include 111 under Paterno, who died in 2012, and the final victory of 2011, when the team was coached by defensive coach Tom Bradley. It returns Paterno's record to 409-136-3. The consent decree had also called for Penn State to provide $60 million to fight child abuse and combat its effects. T-shirts displayed in the window of the Penn State student bookstore honor the 409 career coaching wins of former Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno . In this August 6, 1999, file photo, Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno, right, poses with his defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who was charged with 52 counts of child sex abuse in 2011 . The lawsuit scheduled for trial next month began as an effort by two state officials to enforce a state law that required the money to remain in Pennsylvania. Under the settlement, the money will remain in Pennsylvania. As part of the new proposal, Penn State acknowledges the NCAA acted in good faith. 'We acted in good faith in addressing the failures and subsequent improvements on Penn State's campus,' said Kirk Schulz, member of the NCAA board of governors. 'We must acknowledge the continued progress of the university while also maintaining our commitment to supporting the survivors of child sexual abuse.' The 2012 consent decree was signed by Penn State's then-president, Rodney Erickson, a month after a jury convicted Sandusky and shortly after former FBI director Louis Freeh released the scathing results of a university-commissioned investigation into the Sandusky matter. Its unprecedented penalties drew heated and sustained opposition by Penn State alumni and fans who argued the Freeh report was factually incorrect, defended Paterno's handling of the Sandusky scandal, noted it punished people who had nothing to do with Sandusky and said that the school's athletics program had been considered a national model. In recent months, emails and other documents have been attached to court filings by the NCAA and the plaintiffs, state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman and state Treasurer Rob McCord. In one, an NCAA official described its pursuit of the penalties as 'a bluff' and said asserting jurisdiction would be 'a stretch.' Other records documented that Penn State narrowly avoided a multi-year 'death penalty' which would have suspended the college football powerhouse from playing at all. Corman signed off on the proposal, the senator said at a news conference in Harrisburg. 'The fact of the matter was, an evil predator operated in our community for years and everyone missed it,' Corman said. 'The NCAA has surrendered. The agreement we reached represents a complete victory for the issue at hand.' McCord supports the agreement in principle, but he 'intends to carry out a careful review of the details and language before he signs off,' said his spokesman Gary Tuma. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts and he is now serving a 30-to 60-year prison sentence. He maintains his innocence. Paterno's surviving family members and others had been pursuing another lawsuit over the consent decree. That lawsuit was narrowed by the judge so that it now includes the family, former assistant coaches Jay Paterno and Bill Kenney, and former trustee Al Clemens. Former players, faculty and trustees were removed as plaintiffs. In a statement, Paterno's family called the announcement of a potential settlement 'a great victory for everyone who has fought for the truth in the Sandusky tragedy.' In this November 15, 2014 photo, a banner celebrating the 409 wins of former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno waves over the parking lot outside Beaver Stadium before an NCAA college football game . Mike Guman, a Penn State running back from 1976 to 1979, called the new deal 'a step in the right direction' to vindicating Paterno - the late coach 'was a great leader, a great coach and a great man,' Guman said . They said: 'This case should always have been about the pursuit of the truth, not the unjust vilification of the culture of a great institution and the scapegoating of coaches, players and administrators who were never given a chance to defend themselves.' Michael Boni, a lawyer for one of the victims who testified at Sandusky's trial, said he favored restoring Penn State's scholarships and bowl eligibility last fall, but does not believe Paterno's victories should be reinstated. 'To completely restore, in a sense, Joe Paterno's heretofore pristine reputation, I regret that,' Boni said. 'He did a world of good, but he made a huge, huge error in judgment in helping cover up Sandusky's pedophilia, and even posthumously I think that has to be recognized.' Boni praised Penn State in its dealings with the victims but said he sensed a 'shift in the tide' later. 'There was a movement away from what I thought was a genuine mea culpa on the part of Penn State, having accepted the NCAA sanctions, and one toward, ""Why did we cave so easily?"" That was disappointing,' he said. Mike Guman, a Penn State running back from 1976 to 1979, called the deal 'a step in the right direction' to vindicating Paterno. The late coach 'was a great leader, a great coach and a great man,' Guman said. 'He needs to be looked upon in that light.' The deal infuriated some Penn State alumni who have long contended the NCAA had no authority to punish Penn State over the Sandusky scandal, and who were in favor of a trial.","In 2011, following a two-year grand jury investigation, retired Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky was arrested and charged with 52 counts of sexual abuse of young boys over a 15-year period from 1994 to 2009 .

"Migrating geese are able to fly to extraordinary high altitudes because they take a ‘rollercoaster’ route, scientists have found. Scientists have long been puzzled how geese fly to 24,000 feet (7,300m) or more as they cross the Himalayas. Now British researchers, tracking a flock of bar-headed geese from Mongolia to India, have found that the birds drop altitude before soaring to new heights. Rollercoaster ride: Scientists studies a flock of bar-headed geese (pictured) and discovered that they adjust the altitude of their flight to conserve energy while migrating from Mongolia to India . The scientists, from the universities of Bangor, Exeter and Birmingham, compared the method to the path of a rollercoaster. In order to preserve energy, the geese avoid having to flap harder and harder in very thin air. Instead, the birds track the underlying terrain - even if this means repeatedly shedding hard-won altitude - only to have to regain height later in the same or subsequent flight. As the decreasing air density reduces the bird’s ability to produce the lift and thrust required to maintain flight, they drop down to find more dense air to give them a lift. The scientists, whose work is published in the journal Science, used altitude trackers and heart rate monitors to track the geese. The bar-headed goose has shown how it manages to cruise at extreme altitudes as it soars above the Himalayas. It literally puts its heart into the challenge of breathing air consisting of just seven per cent oxygen, scientists found. Journey: Geese flight to incredible heights when they migrate across the Himalayas (pictured) Available oxygen is channelled to the bird’s heart, which beats fast to pump oxygenated blood to the rest of its body. In this way, the bar-headed goose is able to cross the Himalayan mountain range on its migratory flights between India and China, reaching heights of almost 24,000 feet (7,300 metres). Most people exposed to such conditions would quickly pass out, and may even die. Scientists believe lessons learned from the bar-headed goose could help prevent heart attacks and strokes in humans. Lead researcher Dr Lucy Hawkes, from the centre for ecology and conservation at the University of Exeter, said: 'It all seems to come down to how much oxygen bar-headed geese can supply to their heart muscles. 'The more they can supply, the faster they can beat their hearts and keep the supply of oxygen to the rest of the body going. 'This suggests that other species, including humans, are limited more by what our hearts can do than by how fit the rest of our muscles are at altitude.' Robin Spivey of Bangor University said: ‘As even horizontal flapping flight is relatively expensive at higher altitudes, it is generally more efficient to reduce the overall costs of flying by seeking higher-density air at lower altitudes.’ Professor Pat Butler from the University of Birmingham said the geese would seek out the side of valleys in order to swerve higher - in a way a roller coaster might swoop around a corner and upwards. He said: ‘During these moments, it seems likely that the bar-headed geese are flying on the windward side of a valley wall. ‘This would give them the best opportunity to obtaining assistance from wind that is deflected upwards by the ground, providing additional rates of ascent with either a reduction in their energetic costs or at least no increase.’ Scientists likened the birds' behaviour to that of a rollercoaster - dipping and diving as the air density differed .","Scientists have long been puzzled how geese fly to 24,000 feet .

A man has admitted trying to having sex with a postbox after he was caught with his trousers round his ankles and shouting 'wow', a court heard. Paul Bennett was spotted rubbing himself up and down on the pillar box in the Scholes Precinct shopping centre in Wigan, Greater Manchester, by a female passer-by who called the police. The 45-year-old, who was drunk at the time, had been having an argument with a woman and after she walked away he lay down on a bench and started to shout. His yelling caught the attention of the witness, who looked out her window and saw Bennett pulling down his trousers, exposing himself and performing a sex act. He then moved over to the post box and rubbed himself up and down it with his trousers down, shouting 'wow', before pulling his pants up and checking his reflection in a window. Katie Beattie, prosecuting, said: 'The victim was disgusted and alarmed by his behaviour. She rang the police.' Bennett was found by police officers at the front of a shop in the precinct where he was still exposing himself and statement read to the prosecution described him as drunk. The court heard Bennett became agitated and clenched his teeth as he shouted and swore at the officers. Defending Martin Jones said: 'The lady watched for sometime and was ashamed, disgusted and upset and my client accepts that. Clearly there are issues that need to be addressed.' Bennett pleaded guilty to two charges of indecent exposure and using threatening and abusive words with abusive behaviour at Wigan and Leigh Magistrates' Court. He was handed a 12-month community order with an alcohol treatment and supervision requirement. He was also ordered to pay £50 compensation to the victim, £150 court costs and £60 victim surcharge and made to sign the Sex Offenders Register. Bennett admitted two charges of indecent exposure and was given a 12-month community order.

"A teenager whose girlfriend died next to him in a hotel bed after her prom night allegedly choked the girl during rough sex the night of her death. Eddie M Herrera, 18, reportedly told police 'I put my hands around her neck and squeezed' in a drunken passion, then passed, only to find Jacqueline Gomez, 17, unresponsive when he woke. Herrera, who allegedly told detectives about the act, and stressed the choking was consensual, and also said the two had been popping hydrocodone, a narcotic pain pill, in the Hyatt Hotel in North Houston, Texas, last summer. Dead the next day: Jacqueline Gomez, 17, was found dead by her boyfriend Eddie Herrera (right with Jacqueline) after they spent her prom night together. He has been charged in connection with the death . Caused her death? An autopsy was unclear as to whether choking or an overdose of alcohol and pills were to blame. Herrera has been charged with aggravated assault . An autopsy was unable to determine whether the choking or an overdose killed Jacqueline. According to the Houston Chronicle, she had deep hemorrhaging all the way around her neck. Herrera has been arrested charged with aggravated assault because of the severity of the apparent wounds, and appeared in a court today. He remains in jail over the death, on May 17 last year, and had bail set at $50,000. Jacqueline was reported missing by her parents the morning after the MacArthur High School prom, which was also in the Hyatt hotel, as they had expected their daughter to come home that night. Prom night: The couple had been to Jacqueline's prom at the Hyatt hotel in North Houston, Texas . Prosecutors said that Herrara first called his mother - who helped book the hotel - when he realized Jacqueline was unconscious. She allegedly later came to the hotel, dressed Jacqueline then asked hotel staff for a doctor. They then allegedly called 911. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Herrera, who was arrested Wednesday, faces life in prison if convicted. Prosecutors are deciding whether to charge his mother as well.","Eddie M Herrara, 18, allegedly told police he choke girlfriend in hotel room .

"The ex-girlfriend of paedophile Ian Watkins has claimed she contacted a chief constable about the singer's  obsession with child abuse but police 'couldn't be bothered' to investigate. Joanna Mjadzelics, who was cleared of a string of child sex offences this week, said South Wales Police also 'refused' to take evidence that the Lostprophets star had a cache of child porn. Later Ms Mjadzelics was herself accused of possessing indecent images of a child, sending vile pictures to the singer and demanding that he send her illegal pornography. But following a trial at Cardiff Crown Court, a jury found the 39-year-old not guilty on all charges after she claimed she was trying to entrap her former lover and trick him into revealing his crimes. Scroll down for video . Upsetting: Joanna Mjadzelics, who was cleared of a string of child sex offences this week, said that she went to the very top of South Wales Police about Ian Watkins but the force 'couldn't be bothered' to investigate . Allegations: Ms Mjadzelics claims she took illegal images sent to her by Watkins to police, including bringing her laptop into a police station, but 'they refused to take it', she said . The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is currently investigating officers from three forces over claims they failed to act on reports made to them about Watkins. The court heard that she reported Watkins to the authorities in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012 to raise the alarm over his child sex crimes. She told police he had sent her images of a 'very young girl being raped', but they refused to examine her phone or computer, the jury was told. Today she said she had tried to contact South Wales' chief constable Peter Vaughan in 2011, which was passed on to other officers who she claims failed to properly investigate her claims. Speaking about her ordeal on ITV's This Morning she said: 'I reported the images that he'd sent me, I went straight to the chief constable in 2011, and was in touch with a detective sergeant who I had previously dealt with. 'I kept asking how I was going to get these images to you, and then three more times after that I took my laptop into the police station and they refused to take it. And finally when one of the officers did see the images they swore blind it was over 16 - I was so confused, thinking 'no it isn't'. And told me to get on with my life.' She added, 'It was literally like walking into a wall. And from the documentation I've now had disclosed to me from the CPS - there is actually a note from one detective sergeant and it says ""although the images are alarming, we're reluctant to investigate because it would be high profile and would create a lot of press interest"". Vigilante: The 39-year-old, pictured after she was cleared this week, insisted she was only trying to gather evidence about the crimes of Watkins, left . Watkins, 37, is currently serving a 35-year prison sentence for sex offences including the attempted rape of a fan's baby. Two women were jailed alongside him for assisting his crimes. Ms Mjadzelics, from Doncaster, told the jury during her trial that she reported Watkins to the police, but they ignored her because she was a prostitute who was regarded as a 'nut job'. She insisted that she only engaged in lurid sexual conversations with the shamed star in a bid to collect evidence which would bring Watkins to justice. The prosecution had claimed that she was obsessed with the singer, and would do anything to fuel his desires, but the jury acquitted her. She said: ''I don't feel anything at the moment because I'm still a bit numb from it all.' Talking about rebuilding her life she said: 'I'm completely broke - they've destroyed me financially, emotionally and physically'. Despite having apparently been praised by the police for her actions, Ms Mjadzelics was arrested two years ago, and charged shortly after Watkins and his two accomplices pleaded guilty and were jailed in December 2013. The Crown Prosecution Service defended the decision to pursue the case against Mjadzelics, while South Wales Police described the investigation as ‘extremely challenging and complex’. The force today said it could not comment on her allegations because of the ongoing IPCC investigation. Late 2006: Lostprophets frontman Ian Watkins meets Joanne Mjadzelics online. After weeks of online sex chats, Watkins and Mjadzelics meet in person for the first time in December. They meet up for sex at a hotel in Leeds where they make a sex tape together. July 2007: Mjadzelics says she starts 'getting into' cocaine, with her and Watkins having drug-fuelled sex sessions together. She later has the rock singer's initials - IDKW - tattooed on her back. August 2007: Mjadzelics says Watkins tells her about a sex session he had with a 14-year-old girl. Asked why she did not go to the police there and then about his confession, she said: 'I thought it was the cocaine talking.' September 2007: Watkins tells Mjadzelics he raped a 12-year-old girl after taking cocaine in the toilet with her. He later tells her he was only 'joking'. February 2008: Tape of Watkins and Mjadzelics depicts the pair having sex and talking about having a child together so they could rape and kill it. When questioned about the video, Mjadzelics says: 'It's fantasy talk.' Early 2008: Mjadzelics says she and Watkins split. She blames an indecent photograph of a child which he had sent her on Christmas Day. June 2008: Watkins takes Mjadzelics to meet his mother in Pontypridd. The pair stay at the St David's Hotel in Cardiff. October 2008: Mjadzelics agrees to sign a 'gagging order' drawn up by Watkins after she threatened to go to the police. December 2008: Mjadzelics phones social services in south Wales regarding a photograph he sent the previous Christmas. January 2009: Mjadzelics contacts social services again, as well as police about Watkins. March 2009: Police in Yorkshire interview Mjadzelics at the request of South Wales Police. May 2009: The police investigation into Mjadzelics's initial claims about Watkins ends. She claimed she was turned away because officers regarded her as a 'nut job' fan who was harassing a famous rock star. August 2010: After around a year without speaking to one another, Mjadzelics and Watkins meet up for sex. Mjadzelics apologises to Watkins, claiming that she 'must have got things so wrong'. Two weeks later, Mjadzelics says Watkins shows her a video of a child being sexually abused. She says she goes to police again, and claims nothing was done. May 2011: After becoming estranged from one another again, Mjadzelics resumes contact with Watkins. She says she did so to try to catch Watkins out - and aimed to get evidence on him. The pair resume their sexual relationship. Watkins sends four indecent images to Mjadzelics. May 2011: Mjadzelics sends an email to the Association of Chief Police Officers saying Watkins is raping a child on a 'regular basis'. In her correspondence, she says: 'I've gained his trust again by agreeing to a lot of disgusting things to get whatever is needed to bring him to justice.' February 2012: Mjadzelics says she contacts the father of a child she fears Watkins was abusing. March 2012: Mjadzelics says she contacts South Wales Police regarding a chat she had with Watkins on Skype. Mjadzelics attends Doncaster police station with her laptop. April 2012: Watkins and a female fan, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sexually abuse her son at a London hotel. May 2012: Over three months, South Yorkshire Police is contacted three times over allegations that Watkins is abusing a child. August 2012: Watkins's home is raided by police. One of the singer's laptops is seized by detectives. October 2012: Bedfordshire Police is contacted about allegations, supposedly made by Mjadzelics, that Watkins is planning to abuse another fan's baby. Watkins is later interviewed and bailed by police. November 2012: Mjadzelics is interviewed as a witness by officers from Operation Globe. December 2012: Watkins is again arrested and charged by police. He appears before Cardiff Magistrates' Court along with two female accomplices. January 2013: Mjadzelics arrested and questioned. November/December 2013: Watkins pleads guilty to a string of sex offences - including engaging in sexual activity with a child, the attempted rape of a fan's baby and possessing, making and distributing indecent images. He is given a 29-year jail term, with a further six years on licence. His two female accomplices also plead guilty and receive prison terms. May 2014: The Independent Police Complaints Commission confirms it is investigating claims of gross misconduct regarding three South Yorkshire Police officers, two detectives from the Bedfordshire force and one from South Wales into their handling of reports made to them about Watkins. January 2015: Mjadzelics goes on trial at Cardiff Crown Court, but is cleared.","Joanna Mjadzelics went out with Watkins and contacted police about him .

"Flight Lieutenant Richard Trevor-Roper, who took part in the Dambusters raids during the Second World War. His medals for gallantry are now up for auction . The family of an RAF tail gunner who took part in the Second World War's famous Dambusters raid are selling his gallantry medals at auction for £60,000 after finding them in a box. Flight Lieutenant Richard Trevor-Roper flew on Wing Commander Guy Gibson's  Lancaster during the mission to destroy a series of dams in Germany using 'bouncing bombs'. The raid was a great success with two dams breached by the bombs invented by Dr Barnes Wallis and much of Germany’s industrial heartland including scores of armament factories were wiped out in May 1943. Flight Lieutenant Trevor-Roper, from the Isle of Wight, was singled out for his brave and skillful use of his guns during the raid, which diverted fire from anti-aircraft defences away from other planes in the squadron. He was then awarded Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions but he was sadly killed just a year later during a bombing raid in Nuremberg. Now 72 years on, his medals have been unearthed by his family after they had been lying in a dusty box file. Alongside them were also a series of pictures, including one of the tail gunner with Mr Wallis at Buckingham Palace, they day he received his gallantry medal. The family, who live in the south of England, have now decided to sell the items, which also includes their own copy of the script from the 1955 film the Dam Busters and a brochure from the premiere to go with it. It is thought that only a handful of gallantry medals awarded for the mission have ever come on the open market since 1943, with the last group being sold in 2000. Richard Bromell, of Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne, Dorset, said: 'These are the most outstanding Second World War RAF medals I have had the pleasure to handle. 'A lot of people did so many brave things in order to shorten the war and the Dambusters raid was definitely one of those. 'All of the crew members for the mission were super-elite and as Trevor-Roper was in the lead plane and was the lead gunner of the squadron. One of the lots, which is being sold at the auction, which includes a picture of Flight Lieutenant Trevor-Roper, his gallantry medals, a commemorative scroll and his flying cap . Richard Bromwell from Charterhouse Auctioneers holding the medals, left, and an original script from the Dambusters film, right, which is also up for sale . 'A lot of medals were awarded for that raid but only a handful of them have come on the open market since they were awarded. 'This is the first time Trevor-Roper’s medals have come up for sale. 'It turns out that for many decades the medals, two his RAF side caps, assorted letters, photographs and even a Dam Busters script were kept hidden away in a box file.' The sale, which takes place on March 19, will also include medals awarded to his father, Major Charles Trevor-Roper, who served with the Hampshire Regiment in the First World War. Lieutenant Trevor-Roper pictured with Barnes Wallis, the inventor of the bouncing bomb, at Buckingham Palace in 1943, where he received his Distinguished Flying Cross . Flight Lieutenant Richard Trevor-Roper was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross following the Dambusters raids. His citation stated: 'This officer flew as rear gunner in the leading Lancaster which attacked the Mohne Dam. 'During the run in, his aircraft was subjected to stiff opposition from flack defences situated along the top of the dam. 'By using his rear guns with great skill, even though bullets were passing through the rear structure of the aircraft just behind him, he succeeded not only in deterring the aim of the defences but later in drawing the fire away from other aircraft which were actually making their bombing runs. 'As gunnery leader, Flight Lieutenant Trevor-Roper has set a magnificent example which is an inspiration to all the other gunners in the squadron.'","Flight Lieutenant Richard Trevor-Roper took part in the Dambusters raids .

"A tiny device could be about to revolutionise the way we clean our clothes. Dolfi is no bigger than a bar of soap, yet it transforms any wash basin into a washing machine. Its makers claim that the device washes clothes as well as a standard machine thanks to its ultrasonic technology. Scroll down for video . Clean revolution: The Dolfi (pictured) is no bigger than a bar of soap, yet its makers claims transforms any sink into a mobile washing machine by using ultrasonic waves to blast water off clothes . To use it, a person drops the Dolfi into a sink full of water, dirty clothes and laundry detergent. Powerful ultrasonic soundwaves are emitted by a transducer which travel through the water, forming tiny, high pressure bubbles which implode to create strong jets of water that remove dirt. The device washes the clothes without any need for scrubbing or wringing  in just 30 minutes. Dolfi is so small it can be carried around in a bag for use at home, hotels, or even at work. And its creators claim that unlike a washing machine, which can damage clothes, the ultrasound leaves fabrics completely in tact so they can be washed over and over without deteriorating. Handy on holiday: Dolfi is so small it can be carried around in a bag for use at home, hotels, or even at work. And, unlike a washing machine, which can damage clothes, the ultrasound leaves fabrics completely in tact . The device can be used on any fabric - including cotton, silk, lace and even cashmere - and uses 80 times less energy than a standard washing machine. The machine is the brainchild of German entrepreneur Lena Solis, who was inspired to design it after encountering problem washing clothes while travelling. 'The idea of Dolfi came after a few terrible experiences with laundry during my extensive travel. 'Inspired by amazing benefits of ultrasound, successfully utilised for years in many industrial and medical applications, we're excited to bring the advantages of ultrasonic precise cleaning to everyday personal use. Andre Fangueiro, Dolfi's product designer, added: 'We want people to have more fun on their travels rather than stress about costly laundry . Halve the housework: The Twin Wash System (pictured) was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . LG recently unveiled a washing machine with two washers to save time and energy by cleaning double the amount of clothes simultaneously. Plus, homeowners can control the temperature and length of cycles, and set them to start, while they're out of the house using an app. The Twin Wash System was announced during LG's press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It is powered by the mini washer, which LG calls the 'world's first compact washer in a hide-away pedestal, generating a whole new set of washing options.' For example, muddy gym wear can be separated from whites, or silk underwear can be washed at the same time as towels on a hot wash. When not in use, the mini washer acts simply as the pedestal for the main washer, but it can also be combined with any of LG's front loading washers. The system is Wi-Fi and NFC enabled and is fitted with LG's SmartThinQ technology. This means users can program cycles using an app, including the temperature and length, while they're at work, or on their way home. 'I believe that ultrasonic technology will change the way we wash.' Andre Fangueiro, Dolfi's product designer, added: 'We want people to have more fun on their travels rather than stress about costly laundryservice, or spend time searching for coin laundries, or even waste luggage space packing extra clean clothing. 'With Dolfi, travel will become easier, happier and a lot more fun.' The makers of Dolfi will launch their bid for funding to manufacture the product on Indiegogo on January 20. A donation of $89 - around £60 - will buy the product once it has been manufactured.

"House speaker John Boehner has employed an unusual tactic in his latest salvo against Obama - pictures of Taylor Swift. Boehner (R-Ohio) illustrated an argument attacking the President's plan to fund community college fees for some students by imagining the pop sensation's reaction. In an article posted to his speaker.gov website, Boehner tried to turn voters against the scheme by showing a 'disappointed' Swift falling out of love with the plan. Scroll down for video . Say it with Taylor: House Speaker John Boehner, left on Capitol Hill, used pictures of Taylor Swift to criticize Obama's plan to fund community college for some students. The political leanings of Swift, right, are not known . Tax implications: Posts were illustrated with moving 'gif' images of Swift, such as the above, and said that the plan would cost taxpayers $60billion . While the excitable singer starts out being thrilled by the idea, the 12-part 'listicle' then shows her furious at the funding implications of the plan - which Boehner's staff say will cost taxpayers $60billion. The authors, members of Boehner's staff, then observe: 'Not even all the Taylor Swift album sales in the world would cover that bill.' Continuing with a punning Swift reference, the next picture is captioned: 'Still, 60 billion dollars is a lot of money...you can't just shake it off.' Punning: Boehner staffers made a punning reference to Swift single 'Shake it off', with a clip from the video . Unhappy? A seemingly disapproving Swift was the latest weapon turned against the President . Secret weapon: A Boehner spokesman said the article is a 'fun, effective' way to highlight Obama's failings . She is later shown applauding Republican suggestions for helping people by cutting tax - and reforming early education with unspecified reforms. It is unclear what Swift would make of being used to make a political point. She refused to say who she would vote for in the last presidential election, despite intense speculation. A Myspace post from 2008 on her page reportedly said 'Republicans do it better' - but she has since expressed support for issues, such as gay marriage, which align much more closely with the Democrats. Hooray for tax cuts! A later entry on the post suggested lower taxes as the ideal solution . Boehner's officer told DailyMail.com the listicle is an attempt to widen the audience for the Speaker's political points. Spokesman Michael Steel told DailyMail.com: 'We are always looking for fun, effective ways to communicate with the American people about President Obama's failed policies, and our better solutions. 'As Speaker Boehner says: ""You have to reach people where they are"".' Boehner staffers have used similar tactics before, using shark pictures to highlight a jobs bill and images from How I Met Your Mother to draw attention to a stalled budget. Representatives of Taylor Swift have yet to respond. Meanwhile, the Democrats responded to the attack piece via Twitter, with their own picture of Swift labelled 'Haters gonna hate'.

"With her plaited blonde hair, dazzling designer gown and toned, bronzed figure, Joanne Froggatt — the one-time Plain Jane of Soapland — looked like an entirely different person at the Golden Globes this week. After almost two decades of acting, Froggatt has become a familiar face on our TV screens. It’s just not a face associated with Hollywood glamour. Instead, the British actress has made her name playing dowdy TV roles, from dinner lady to prison inmate. Scroll down for video . Alchemy: Joanne’s girl-next-door look at the BAFTAs in 2001 (left) has evolved into the golden girl with a Golden Globe, seen this week (right) So watching her this week collecting the best supporting actress in a TV drama award, for her portrayal of Downton Abbey rape victim Anna, the transformation was incredible. The 34-year-old looked completely at home among Hollywood’s finest as she gave a gracious acceptance speech. Could it be that she will be the one of the very small handful of British former soap stars to successfully carve out a career in Hollywood? If she doesn’t, it certainly won’t be for the want of trying. So just how has the 5ft 2in Yorkshire-born girl transformed herself from Britain’s average Jo(anne) into a Hollywood princess? The answer is a clever campaign involving a hugely expensive stylist and crack PR team. Plus, the personal grittiness to succeed that she has shown since aged 11. There was nothing accidental about her perfect grooming at the Globes. Behind this transformation is the outrageously outgoing Brad Goreski, a stylist to the stars. Joanne’s embellished Marchesa dress — worth north of £5,500 — was his choice, and he is apparently now picking out her outfit for the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Goreski’s clients include global stars Jessica Alba, Demi Moore and Christina Ricci — and his services do not come cheap. A ballpark estimate for his personal services at a Hollywood event is up to £10,000. Pictured left in 1996 on The Bill as a fresh-faced ingénue, Frogatt was 15 when she landed a role in The Bill as an underage prostitute. Right, she is pictured in 1997-98 on Coronation Street as single mum Zoe Tattersall . Here she is pictured left in 1999 in the series Bad Girls, as plain prison inmate Rachel Hicks, who took her own life during the first series. Pictured right in 1999 in Dinnerladies, she is distinctly dowdy in a cameo role in the Victoria Wood sitcom, appearing as work experience girl Sigourney . Left in 2000 she is pictured in Lorna Doone as mousy Lizzie Ridd in the BBC adaptation of R. D. Blackmore’s novel. Pictured right in 2001 and acting opposite David Jason in A Touch Of Frost, Joanne looks a little more glamorous with her short bob and make-up . For this, a stylist will secure the loan of a dress, or dresses, plus sourcing a suite of matching jewellery and arranging the right hair and make-up. In Joanne’s case, rising hair stylist Ashley Streicher created her messy plaited up-do for the Golden Globes. But make no mistake, Joanne did not come across these style gurus by luck. They will have been handpicked by her seasoned Hollywood personal publicists at ID PR. They arranged for her to attend all of the better pre-Globes parties, including an ‘It girls’ lunch hosted by fashion magazine W, along with Kim Kardashian. She has come a long way. Born in Littlebeck, Yorkshire, to Annie and Keith Froggatt, who ran a corner shop before moving to a smallholding near Whitby, Joanne grew up on a rare-breed sheep farm. ‘My parents always taught me and my brother Daniel to be open-minded and go for the things we want.’ At 11, she joined a local drama group in Scarborough and eventually got the funding for a boarding place at Redroofs theatre school in Berkshire, aged 14. Left, she is pictured in 2006 in Life on Mars: With a girl-next-door prettiness, Joanne played Ruth Tyler, the mother of time-traveller Sam. Right, in 2006, she was compelling as Maureen Smith, sister of killer Myra Hindley (Maxine Peake, left), in the Bafta-winning drama See No Evil: The Moors Murders . In 2007 she starred in Murder In The Outback (left), in which her low-level beauty let her nail the real-life Joanne Lees. And right, in 2008, she looked prim in another Plain Jane casting, this time as field office leader Hannah in Spooks: Code 9 . She made her television debut at 15, playing an underage prostitute in The Bill. But she had to leave drama school after her GCSEs as funding dried up. She was working full-time in WHSmith when a casting director from Granada got in touch about an opening in Coronation Street. What was meant to be four days’ work in 1997 turned into 18 months. Her character Zoe Tattersall — a teenage single mum who sold her baby and stole it back before the infant died of meningitis while she was out clubbing — set the tone for her future typecasting. After Corrie, came a string of roles perfectly suited to her everyday look — prison drama Bad Girls in 1999, then dinnerladies with Victoria Wood and parts in A Touch Of Frost and Spooks. In See No Evil: The Moors Murders, her portrayal of Myra Hindley’s sister Maureen Smith was a triumph, and the show nabbed a Bafta. Her role in Army drama In Our Name in 2010 won Joanne Best Newcomer at the British Independent Film Awards. In 2009 she starred in Robin Hood (left) in a sexier role when she joined the BBC’s much-hyped adaptation in its third series as villager Kate. Right, in 2010, in the film In Our Name, playing a traumatised private returning from Iraq which won her Best Newcomer at the British Independent Film Awards . Pictured left in 2010 in the Royle Family Christmas special - this time looking pretty and radiant as Anthony’s girlfriend Saskia. Right, in 2010-2015 in  Downton Abbey as a rape victim, accused of murder — housemaid Anna is another unglamorous role, but it has finally made Joanne a global star . Froggatt had established herself as the go-to actress for gritty, realistic characters, . As Anna the maid in Downton Abbey, she received Emmy nominations in 2012 and 2014. But while her style on camera remained dowdy and demure, on the red carpet Froggatt began to flourish. And the grit that saw her propel herself from a Yorkshire farm to Britain’s biggest drama series is about to take her to Hollywood, too. She and husband James Cannon, a software programmer, plan to move to LA in August so she can meet film and TV executives in person. But Froggatt understands — despite her Hollywood makeover — where her skills lie. ‘I’m not classically beautiful. I always play girls who are traumatised, or a plain girl. I’ve played really interesting characters — but I couldn’t compete with Julia Roberts.’ Yet on Sunday night, when she swung confidently into the HBO party after the Golden Globes then on to the night’s starriest gathering, the Weinstein Company bash, she looked every bit the Hollywood film star. Julia Roberts better watch out.","Actress Joanne Froggatt looked an entirely different person this week .

"Global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880, US scientists claim. Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8°C (1.4°F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years. The Met Office has already announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the UK in records dating back to 1910. Scroll down for video . Last year was the Earth’s warmest since 1880, according to two separate studies by Nasa and the Noaa. With the exception of 1998, the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2010. In an independent analysis of the raw data, released today, Noaa (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) scientists also found 2014 to be the warmest on record. Nasa scientists claim their analysis of surface temperature measurements suggests the long-term warming of the planet. John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at Nasa headquarters in Washington, said: ‘The observed long-term warming trend and the ranking of 2014 as the warmest year on record reinforces the importance for Nasa to study Earth as a complete system, and particularly to understand the role and impacts of human activity.’ Since 1880, Earth’s average surface temperature has warmed by about 0.8°C (1.4°F) over the 20th century average, which Nasa’s scientists said is a trend that’s largely driven by the increase in carbon dioxide,  and other human emissions into the planet’s atmosphere. The majority of that warming has occurred in the past three decades, they claim. Gavin Schmidt, Director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) in New York, said: ‘This is the latest in a series of warm years, in a series of warm decades. Noaa's data also revealed that 2014 was the hottest year since records began. This map is made up of provisional data from 2014 up to October. It said, at the time, that there was no realistic scenario where the temperatures in November and December would not make it the hottest year . Last week, the Japan Meteorological Association (JMA) claimed that 2014 was the hottest on record . It said it was 0.27°C warmer than the average from 1981 to 2010, and 0.63°C warmer than the 20th century average - without the help of an El Niño weather event. It too, found that 10 of the hottest years occurred since 1998. The JMA, Noaa, Nasa and Met Office all made their calculations separately, but came to the same conclusion. Experts say the rate at which it is warming is alarmingly quick, and heavily suggests the emission of CO2 by humans is causing man-made global warming. The JMA's findings also reveal there has been no warming slowdown in the past decade, despite claims to the contrary by sceptics. ‘While the ranking of individual years can be affected by chaotic weather patterns, the long-term trends are attributable to drivers of climate change that right now are dominated by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Despite 2014 temperatures continuing the planet’s long-term warming trend, scientists still expect to see year-to-year fluctuations in average global temperature caused by events such as El Niño or La Niña. These phenomena warm or cool the tropical Pacific and are thought to have played a role in the flattening of the long-term warming trend over the past 15 years. However, 2014’s record warmth occurred during an El Niño-neutral year. Noaa analysis found that regional differences in temperature are more strongly affected by weather dynamics than the global average. For example, in the US last year, parts of the Midwest and East Coast were unusually cool, while Alaska and three western states -California, Arizona and Nevada - experienced their warmest year on record. Nasa’s analysis incorporated surface temperature measurements from 6,300 weather stations including from Antarctic research stations and sea surface temperatures from ship and buoy-based operations. Scientists analysed the raw data using an algorithm that takes into account the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heating effects that could skew the calculation. Since 1880, Earth’s average surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius), a trend that is largely driven by the increase in carbon dioxide and other human emissions into the planet’s atmosphere . The result is an estimate of the global average temperature difference from a baseline period of 1951 to 1980. While Noaa researchers used much of the same raw temperature data, they used a different baseline period and their own method to estimate global temperatures, but came to the same worrying conclusion. Nasa scientists claim that their analysis of surface temperature measurements suggests the long-term warming of the planet, due to an increase in carbon dioxide and other human emissions into the planet’s atmosphere. A stock image of smoke emitted from smokestacks is shown . Bob Ward, policy director of the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, said: ‘The new global temperature record announced today completely exposes the myth that global warming has stopped. ‘There is mounting evidence all around the world that the Earth is warming and the climate is changing in response to rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. A stock image of a green shoot in cracked, dry soil is pictured . ‘No politician can afford to ignore this overwhelming scientific evidence or claim that global warming is a hoax.’ The average temperature across Britain in 2014 was 9.9°C (49.8°F), some 1.1°C (2°F) above the long term average of 8.8°C (47.8°F), making it warmer than the previous record year of 2006. The Met Office said the weather record of one individual year cannot be attributed to man-made global warming. But it also points out that climate change makes warm years more likely than not. Last week, Japan's Meteorological Association released its data for 2014 (shown). It said 2014 was the hottest year on record, at 0.27°C above the average from 1981 to 2010, and 0.63°C above the 20th Century average .","Nasa and the Noaa both said that last year was the hottest since 1880 .

"He may have been declared the 'ninth wonder of the universe' as the 'world's only flying elephant'. But these Dumbo-shaped clouds prove that you can see elephants fly - even if it is just in a cloud formation. Disney's cartoon character appeared in the sky over Flagg in Derbyshire just a short distance from another formation which resembled the march of the elephants in the Jungle Book. They were captured by nature photographer Jim, who said: 'I couldn't believe it - it was Dumbo on one side and the Jungle Book on the other.

It looked like Dumbo the elephant so I quickly got my camera out. 'Then less than a minute later I turned around to see another cloud shaped like the march of the elephants scene in the Jungle Book. It was amazing. 'What was so great was that they were in two hundred yards of each other.' One cloud looked like a large elephant flicking its tail and raising its trunk and another seconds later appeared to be in the shape of a herd. Dumbo was  the most financially successful Disney film of the 1940s, eventually grossing just over £1million during its original release.

"Old rivals Aer Lingus and Ryanair have taken their feud to Twitter after Ireland’s national airline pointed out an embarrassing gaffe on the budget carrier’s website. The latest row erupted when Aer Lingus tweeted photos and claimed one of its planes was featured in the background of an online advert for Ryanair’s ‘business plus’ service. With a smiley face emoticon for good measure, Aer Lingus gleefully wrote to its 89,000 followers: ‘Epic #photobomb by EI-DVM on Ryanair’s website! Even they know we’re Best for Business’. The latest row between the rivals erupted when Aer Lingus claimed its plane is featured in a Ryanair advert . Ryanair fired back with a tweet accusing Aer Lingus of providing expensive and poor service to customers . Aer Lingus’ attempt to publicly embarrass Ryanair didn’t sit well with its low-cost rival. Ryanair responded with an affront of its own: ‘Even @AerLingus is talking about @Ryanair Business Plus. FYI, he’s smiling cos he saved a fortune & avoided another late @AerLingus arrival!’ As their Twitter followers weighed in and encouraged more banter, the Dublin-based airlines traded a few more tweets before calling it quits. Aer Lingus tweeted a photo of the advert on Ryanair's website, calling it an 'epic photobomb' Aer Lingus claims the plane in the Ryanair advert is its Airbus A320-214 with a retro livery . One Twitter user asked if it was friendly banter or if the airlines hate each other. Aer Lingus responded: ‘Just some healthy rivalry, Des. Isn’t that right, @Ryanair?’ But Ryanair, whose feisty chief executive Michael O’Leary once famously told customers looking for a refund to f*** off, refused to play nice. It said: ‘We stopped being rivals in the 90s. We’d have to treble our fares & lose 81m customers to be your rival’. Twitter followers weighed in and encouraged more banter or questioned whether it was 'friendly banter' Aer Lingus replied: ‘Okay, nevermind. #PeaceOut’. The Twitter row came a day before the UK Court of Appeal was schedule to rule on Ryanair’s 29.82 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair is the largest individual shareholder and it is set to find out if it will be forced to comply with competition regulators and sell down to no more than five per cent. Earlier this week Ryanair predicted British Airways-owner IAG will return with another tilt at Aer Lingus as soon as this week. The budget airline said it is ‘actively’ seeking a buyer for its stake in Aer Lingus, which it has to sell due to competition requirements, and expects IAG to make a third offer to the group imminently.","Aer Lingus tweeted a photo of the plane to its 89,000 followers on Twitter .

"A judge ruled on Friday that a seven-months' pregnant teen accused of murdering her socialite mother can use the $1.6 million trust fund left to her by her dead mom. Heather Mack, 19, is facing execution by firing squad in Bali, Indonesia, if  found guilty of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase outside a luxury hotel last August. On Thursday, a day after she made a preliminary court appearance to be charged with pre-meditated murder, Miss Mack, of Chicago, sued her uncle William Wiese, to release money to pay for a defense lawyer. Scroll down for video . Heather Mack, 19, (pictured on Wednesday) who is on trial for her mother's murder and due to give birth in March, was granted access to her $1.6million trust fund by a Chicago judge on Friday . Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, is believed to have been murdered by her daughter (left) and daughter's boyfriend in Bali in August. Her daughter was today granted access to a trust fund left by her mom for a lawyer . According to the Chicago Tribune, Judge Neil Cohen said at court in Chicago on Friday that the pregnant teen can access the estate - but the exact amount has not yet been thrashed out by lawyers. A court hearing has been set for next week. A retired Cook County judge will be appointed to serve as interim trustee, according to Judge Cohen today. The 19-year-old sued Mr Wiese, who became trustee of the estate, after he denied her access to the money of which her mother made her sole beneficiary in May. The 19-year-old had a red string tied around her engagement ring finger as she waited behind bars on Wednesday. Mack will stand trial for her mother's murder alongside lover Tommy Schaefer . She claimed that needs the money to find a decent defense lawyer - as the reputation of her current Indonesian attorney, whom she found via word-of-mouth, has been questioned. The teen had originally asked for $300,000 but cut that amount in half, according to the court filing, and asked that Mr Wiese, who is an attorney, hand the money over to the U.S. Consulate. The filing read: 'Said legal funds are a necessity to preserve Heather's life.' Mr Wiese responded to the court filing to say that he feared Miss Mack would try to use the money as a bribe. . The uncle refused to release the money and has made no comment other than to previously tellThe Tribune that the family wanted the teenager to receive a fair trial. He also said that his 62-year-old sister deeply loved her daughter and had hoped that a luxury vacation could help mend their broken relationship. Heather Mack and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, who is also from Chicago, stand accused of killing Mrs Wiese-Mack after her brutally-beaten body was discovered in a suitcase placed in the trunk of a taxi. On Wednesday, Miss Mack, who wore a loose white shirt over her large baby bump, and her lover arrived in handcuffs for the hearing at a court in Denpasar on the Indonesian resort island. The 19-year-old also had a red string tied around her engagement ring-finger as she waited behind bars. A policeman inspects the suitcase where the body of Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, was found inside at the police station in Nusa Dua on the Indonesian resort island of Bali . The pair have been given separate trials on charges of premeditated murder, which carry a maximum sentence of the death penalty. Police claim the couple plotted to murder socialite Mrs von Wiese-Mack following an earlier argument between the mother and daughter over money . Mack and Schaefer said on Wednesday that they understood the charges. They are to enter pleas when the trial resumes next week. Senior Police Commissioner Djoko Hariutomo told Daily Mail Online in December: ‘If they are both convicted of murder they could face the death penalty. There is evidence here of premeditation.’ The judges and prosecutors are the same in both trials. In their indictments, prosecutors said the couple plotted to kill Mrs von Wiese-Mack because she did not endorse their relationship. Mack once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000 before their visit to Bali, according to prosecutors. On Wednesday, the couple were brought from holding cells having been transferred to the island’s notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of the court appearance. Their lawyers planned to submit defense pleas when the trial resumes next week. Mack and her mother arrived in Bali on August 4 and stayed in Kuta before moving to the St. Regis hotel in Nusa Dua, where they planned to stay until August 14. Schaefer arrived August 12 and stayed at the same hotel in a room booked by Mack under her mother's name. Prosecutors said that made Mack's mother angry and led to an argument in which Mrs von Wiese-Mack, who was white, scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur. Schaefer is black, as was Mack's father, James L. Mack, a highly-regarded jazz and classical composer who died in 2006. They said Schaefer then battered her with the iron grip of a fruit bowl. Security camera video showed the victim earlier having an argument with Schaefer in the hotel lobby. Seven-months pregnant Heather Mack, of Chicago, appeared emotional as she attended court in Bali, Indonesia, on Wednesday after being charged with the brutal murder of her mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack . Accused murderer Tommy Schaefer, 21, listened in on proceedings sitting next to his translator at the court in Denpasar, Bali . Mack, right, and Schaefer, left, arrive in handcuffs for their separate trials in Bali. They allegedly plotted to kill Mrs von Wiese-Mack because she did not endorse their relationship . The indictment said the couple hired a taxi and placed the suitcase containing the body in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did. The young couple were arrested on August 13 after checking into another hotel following the gruesome discovery of Mrs von Wiese-Mack outside the St Regis Hotel. Police claim the pair plotted Mrs von Wiese-Mack's murder also because of another argument between Miss Mack and her mother over money. Other evidence submitted to prosecutors included CCTV footage showing the couple speaking to a taxi driver after dropping the bloodied suitcase along with other luggage outside the hotel. A lawyer for Mack, pictured on Wednesday, claims the teen hid in the bathroom while her mother was bludgeoned to death in the Bali hotel room . According to a statement Miss Mack has given to police, she had no part in her mother’s murder, but went along with helping her boyfriend move the body out of a sense of duty . Bali police Col. Djoko Hariutomo said that officers had questioned 12 witnesses and that their case included information from the FBI. Officers brought the physical evidence to the prosecutors in large sacks, including the iron grip of a fruit bowl alleged to be the weapon used in the slaying, and several computer hard drives containing hotel surveillance camera videos. But the lawyer for the teenager claims that the killing was not premeditated and that she had hid in the bathroom while her mother was bludgeoned to death in her hotel room. According to a statement Miss Mack has given to police, she had no part in her mother’s murder, but went along with helping her boyfriend move the body out of a sense of duty because he was the father of her unborn baby, who is due in March. The account she has given to police - which her lawyer Mr Raja Nasution hopes will result in her receiving a lesser charge - paints a picture of a terrified young woman who waited in terror in the bathroom of room 317 while her boyfriend and her mother had a furious argument which resulted in Mrs Mack being beaten to death. In December, Miss Mack told reporters from her cell: 'My baby is a girl, she is fine. 'I want her to stay in Bali so she can visit me anytime while I'm in jail.' At the time a police spokesman said that Miss Mack would continue to be under medical observation while in Kerobokan Prison because she is pregnant and due to give birth in March. Mack and her mother had a troubled relationship and von Wiese-Mack had frequently reported that her daughter punched and bit her, according to police reports cited by Chicago media. Von Wiese-Mack had recently moved to a condominium in Chicago. Her husband, and Heather's father, classical music composer James Mack, died in 2006. The murder trials of the teenager and her boyfriend got underway in Indonesia on Wednesday with high media interest .

"In a bid to help potential recruits get a real feel for life as an Army Reservist, the Ministry of Defence is turning to virtual reality. During a series of events in London and Manchester today, the recruits will be fitted with Oculus Rift headsets and dropped into virtual training exercises. One will reveal what it's like to take part in a live fire exercise on Salisbury Plain, while another will let wearers take part in a mission in a Challenger 2 tank. During a series of events in London and Manchester, Army Reservist recruits will be fitted with Oculus Rift headsets (stock image) and dropped into virtual training exercises. One will reveal what it's like to take part in a live fire exercise, while another will let wearers take part in a mission in a Challenger 2 tank . The events are taking place at Waterloo station in London and at Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens. The experiences were created by London-based Visualise, and begins when the user takes a seat in a Range Rover. The Rift headset is made by Oculus, a virtual reality firm which initially received funding for the device through Kickstarter. The Norwegian Army is trialling a system that uses the Oculus Rift to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch. Cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset, creating the illusion that the tank is ‘transparent.’ When a driver looks left, they see footage from the left camera, and vice versa on the right - achieving a 360-degree view of the road. By lowering their gaze and looking down towards the vehicle belts, the driver can also use the system to parallel park 'with a precision of up to a centimetre', without the assistance of the vehicle commander. It also removes the blind spots that occur when driving large vehicles. It raised more than $2 million dollars (£1.3 million) in 2012, and last year Oculus was bought by Facebook for $2 billion (£1.3 billion). Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said at the time of the acquisition: 'Oculus [is] the clear leader in something that has the potential to be the next important, or one of the next most important, computing platforms.' The headset is yet to go on consumer sale, although it is available online as a development kit for around £230 ($350). The first Army experience that uses the headset will drop the wearer into a live fire exercise with virtual members of the Army Reserve at the Ministry's Salisbury Plain Training Area. As a crewman in a Challenger 2 tank, in the second experience, the wearer will be surrounded by other tanks engaging enemy positions using laser sights. They will also be able to communicate with other soldiers in armoured vehicles driving alongside. The Army said it will add further experiences in the future. The Army's new recruitment campaign, which involves a new TV advert that will be on show at the drive, comes as new research reveals one in four people said they felt challenge and excitement was missing from their job. Today's events are taking place at Waterloo station in London, the other at Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens. The first experience will drop the wearer into a live fire exercise with virtual members of the Army Reserve at the Ministry's Salisbury Plain Training Area (stock image pictured) As a crewman in a Challenger 2 tank (stock image), in the second experience the wearer will be surrounded by other tanks engaging enemy positions using laser sights.

The MoD offers a '100% Army Fit' app (pictured) to help recruits build their fitness to the level of a soldier in training . According to the Army, a One Poll survey revealed that around seven in 10 people would consider volunteering or a part-time job alongside their normal work. And one in four said they would consider joining the Army Reserves to 'find that challenge and excitement'. Major General Chris Tickell, director-general of the Army recruiting and training division, said: 'This research tells us that people feel their day jobs are lacking challenge, excitement and the opportunity to travel - all of which are available at a world-class standard with the Army Reserve. 'By using the virtual headsets, people will be able to step straight into an exciting real-world scenario of volunteering with the Army Reserve and the huge variety of challenging roles there are to choose from. 'Introducing virtual reality technology is just one of the ways that the Army is transforming the way it recruits. The Army recently introduced a simplified, online application form for mobile, tablet or desktop to help people sign up. It also offers a '100%  Army Fit' app that helps new recruits build their fitness to the level of a soldier in training,  and new mobile recruitment offices. Henry Stuart, the managing director of Visualise, added: 'This is the first time virtual reality has ever been used for recruitment purposes and to me, the Army are the perfect client to achieve this world-first with, as an organisation that has always mixed tradition with cutting-edge technology. 'As virtual reality becomes ever-more mainstream, the applications of it widen. From launching cars for Mercedes by allowing you to sit alongside Lewis Hamilton as he tears around a racetrack, to allowing members of the public to become instant virtual holidaymakers with Thomas Cook, we are seeing brands around the world over sit up and take notice of the possibilities.'","Headset will let wearers experience tasks carried out by Army reservists .

The screenplay, by Sir Tom Stoppard, is adapted from a novel by Deborah Moggach and was originally set to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley in 2004. However, the production was halted as a result of changes in tax rules affecting film production in the UK. Last year, producer Alison Owen teamed up with Harvey Weinstein to restart the film, which will be released later this year. Dame Judi Dench also joins the cast as does Glee star Matthew Morrison and Tom Hollander. Mr Weinstein said: ‘Cressida is great and people will see what a fantastic actress she is. It will be the first of many roles for her.’ He praised her for not trying to use her fame to secure roles, saying: ‘She is not taking advantage of any media profile.’ Cressida Bonas dazzled in a white Mulberry dress at the BAFTA tea party to celebrate the Golden Globes in LA on Saturday - and wore the same dress in black at the Weinstein Company's Golden Globes party on Sunday night .

"A super-fit mum has come under fire for 'fat-shaming' women - after she posted a picture of her six-pack on Instagram. Fitness fanatic, Abby Pell, 33, from East Grinstead, East Sussex, thought she was helping encourage others to lose post-pregnancy weight when she shared the picture of her posing with her daughter. She included the message 'I have a kid, a six pack and no excuse.' Scroll down for video . Abby Pell posted this picture of her and her six-year-old daughter Bella on Instagram and was met by a barrage of abuse accusing the mother-of-one of fat shaming . But instead of support, the mum-of-one was branded 'shameless' by scores of people and met with abuse from her followers. One web user wrote: 'This is so demeaning - I bet she doesn't have to work for a living.' Another added: 'This is fat shaming, pure and simple. Exploiting your motherhood to show off is despicable and shameless.' Dedicated mum Abby manages to juggle motherhood and running her own nutrition business while still hitting the gym up to six days a week. 'I was on the heavier side so I tried a range of weight loss plans like The Atkins Diet and the South Beach Diet and just generally restricting my daily calorie allowance. 'But I would always end up so hungry I'd get to the point where I couldn't bear to starve myself any longer. Abby piled on the pounds while she was pregnant reaching 13st when she was pregnant with her daughter and has now slimmed down to 9st after she took up weight training . The personal trainer from East Sussex was shocked to be accused of 'fat-shaming' and says that she never meant to offend anyone with her photo . 'And as soon as I gave in the weight would go straight back on.' Abby turned to intense weight training taking just a year to sculpt her impressive abs, after she ballooned to 13 stone when she was pregnant with daughter Bella, now six, and struggled to lose shed the extra 50lb. 'I decided to have just one last push, so I started lifting weights, and I was astonished at the results that came so quickly. 'My bum was firmer, arms more defined and my abs were showing. 'Now going to the gym is where I have my 'me-time,' which all mums know they need.' Abby, who now weighs 9st and is a size eight, says she feels better now than before she was pregnant. The personal trainer was immensely proud of her achievements and naturally wanted to share success with her friends and family. Abby was aiming to inspire other mothers to shape up after pregnancy rather than anger them as she believes that having a child is no excuse for being inactive and overweight . Abby only put the picture of her flat stomach, complete with the offending caption, after her proud daughter told her that she looked like Wonder Woman. 'One day Bella said to me, 'You look like Wonder Woman, Mummy.' That's what gave me the idea for the Instagram picture.' Abby was expecting the picture to cause a stir but was stunned with the amount of negativity she received. 'I never meant to offend anyone - my life is better now that I'm in shape, so I hoped I could encourage others to do the same. Abby decided to put the image up after her daughter told her that she looked like Wonder Woman . 'It's a sorry state of affairs when someone's healthy passion is labelled abusive, whilst obesity, junk food marketing and laziness are all on the rise. You keep going.' Abby, who posts pictures on Twitter and Instagram under the name @SuperAbs, reckons that if just one person takes up her advice, it will be worth it. 'There were some positive messages congratulating me on working hard but they were mostly negative, criticising me for fat-shaming and adding pressure on mums to look fantastic. 'I'm not saying the nasty comments are jealousy, but it might be that these people are insecure in the way that they look.' The 33-year-old added that when it comes to shaping up too many people rely on dubious reasons not to. Abby believes that just because you're a mother that doesn't mean you should give up on fitness . 'Some people want to be able to make excuses and don't like it when an alternative body type is put in their face. 'Having a child is not a valid reason for being out of shape. Everybody can make excuses. I want to show that this figure is achievable. 'It doesn't matter if you're overweight, if you have a busy lifestyle and kids to look after - if you want to do it then there's always a way. 'Being a mum doesn't mean you have to give up.' Abby added that even people who are extremely fit don't have the perfect body. 'You can have stretch marks and a great figure - I'm so proud of my body and I want other people to be proud of their bodies too.'","Abby Pell, 33, posted a picture of her abs on Instagram to inspire others .

"A teenage boy has been caught posing as an OB/GYN doctor at a hospital, investigators said today. Police were called on Tuesday after a patient alerted staff at St Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, that a juvenile dressed in a lab coat was inside an exam room. The 17-year-old boy was found in the OB/GYN office of the Florida medical center, which is not part of the main hospital but an outpatient clinic. The patient said he was wearing a lab coat that had St. Mary's logo and 'anesthesiology' stitched on the front. The 17-year-old boy was found in the OB/GYN office of St Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Florida (pictured) wearing a white coat and carrying a stethoscope . The teen was carrying a stethoscope and a face mask and telling people that he was a doctor, according to the Sun-Sentinel. According to an arrest report: 'St Mary's Medical Center staff inside the OB/GYN office were alerted by a patient that a young black male who appeared to be a child was dressed as a doctor.' A security guard told police he'd seen the teen around the hospital for a month. Another said the teen entered secured areas of the hospital this week. Surveillance footage around the hospital revealed the boy entering the hospital from a car in the parking lot which had a white coat in the back seat. The teen told police he's been a doctor for years and to speak to his family for confirmation. The boy's mother later told investigators that her son was suffering from an undisclosed condition and was under the care of a doctor but had not been taking his medicine. Police in Florida and officials at St Mary's Medical Center have agreed not to charge the teen. The hospital said that the teenager did not have access to any patients or any care area.","Police were called on Tuesday after a juvenile dressed in lab coat and with stethoscope was found inside exam room .

"Tommy Caldwell's free climb up the sheer face of El Capitan in California makes him one of the world's bravest men. He's now revealed that his courage and drive in life partly comes from a terrifying kidnap ordeal at the hands of murderous Islamists, which only ended when he pushed one of his captors off a cliff. Caldwell has told how after this 'pain and suffering paled in comparison'. Scroll down for videos . Tommy Caldwell (left) beside fellow climber Kevin Jorgeson during a news conference  in El Capitan meadow following their taming of the mountain's Dawn Wall . Tommy Caldwell's free climb up the sheer face of El Capitan in California makes him one of the world's bravest men - and he's now revealed that his drive partly comes from a terrifying kidnap ordeal . The horrifying drama took place in 2000 while he was attempting to scale a sheer face in the Pamir mountains in Kyrgyzstan with three other climbers, including his then-girlfriend, Beth Rodden. While they were resting in a tent attached half-way up the rock-face, four terrorists from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a group linked to Al Qaeda, began spraying them with bullets. Fearing that they were just seconds from being killed, they abseiled down to the ground. Six days of hell followed as the gunmen moved them from place to place, with little food or water. Kyrgyz army helicopters hunted the terrorists, who told the group, which included climbers Jason Smith and John Dickey, that they would be shot if they didn't hide from them. Beth Rodden (left) and Tommy Caldwell pose for a photo during an interview  in 2002 about their harrowing experience as captives in Kyrgyzstan two years previously . Happy to be home: Caldwell and Beth speaking to the media after their ordeal in 2000 . Dangerous territory: Caldwell, his then girlfriend Beth, and two other climbers, were kidnapped while climbing  in the Pamir mountain range . Eventually, the group saw a chance to escape when just one terrorist was left in charge of them. They knew that they could die in the sub-zero temperatures and that drastic action had to be taken. Caldwell described how he grabbed the terrorist's gun as they crossed a narrow ridge and shoved him off. Their captor bounced off a ledge below and disappeared into the darkness. Caldwell was immediately wracked with guilt. He told the Daily Mirror: 'I totally panicked. I thought I was an evil person. I said to Beth, 'How can you love me after I did something like this?' 'I was, like, ""What is inside me that allowed me to do this?"". And I was basically curled up in a ball. I had totally broken down. And they were trying to comfort me. They were saying how I'd just saved their lives. It was helping, but I still couldn't believe that I had just done that.' The experience, however, changed his perspective on life permanently. He added: 'I was pretty sure I was going to die. I'm so glad to be alive. I have to embrace every day of my life. After than incident, any pain and suffering paled in comparison.' And his anguish over his attack on the guard subsided when he learned that he'd survived the fall. Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson, both from the US, completed the ascent of El Capitan, one of California's most iconic features, on Wednesday. It was a feat deemed impossible by many. They called their 19-day taming of the sheer 900-meter (2,950-feet) rock face in Yosemite National Park a 'spiritual experience.' The iconic rock formation El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, California . The two made the journey up the previously untraversed Dawn Wall, a sheer granite rock face on the massive formation considered one of the most difficult free climbs in the world. 'It felt like a very spiritual experience the whole time, even now it feels a bit surreal to me,' Caldwell told reporters following the climb. Jorgeson added: 'When you would grab that last hole you could literally feel all of the hope, desire and stress drop off of you.' Free climbing involves climbing with only the hands and feet. The only ropes are fixed from below as a safety precaution. The two had trained for years and planned their climb months in advance, carefully studying their route up the Dawn Wall. During the journey Caldwell and Jorgeson slept in small tents affixed to the rock face and climbed up the ropes to where they had left off for a new day of climbing. 'I think that the camaraderie that we had was crucial,' Caldwell said. As the two neared the end of their journey, they attracted international attention for the incredible feat. People watch as the two climbers ascend the 'Dawn Wall' In this December 28, 2014, photo provided by Tom Evans, Tommy Caldwell ascends what is known as pitch 10 of El Capitan . El Capitan rises more than 3,000 feet above the Yosemite Valley floor. The first climber reached its summit in 1958, and there are roughly 100 routes up to the top . Kevin Jorgeson grips the surface of a razor-sharp edge as he makes his way up the 3000ft El Capitan . The climb took a grueling 19 days and the climbers kept the public up to date with their progress using social media . Dozens of news outlets covered the finale of the climb when Jorgeson and Caldwell were greeted by friends and sprayed with champagne. US President Barack Obama tweeted words of congratulations with a photo of himself in front of a painting of the notable rock face. 'You remind us that anything is possible,' Obama wrote. The critical moment for Jorgeson came at the beginning of the month about half way up the free climb. Their climbing was divided into sections or 'pitches' between which their safety ropes were strung. On pitch 15, Jorgeson reached an impasse. The taller climber needed to reach out with his full armspan, and hold with just two fingers of one hand to pull himself to the next hold and finish the pitch. Determined: Tommy Caldwell, top, climbs Pitch 17 with Kevin Jorgeson handling the line .

Rock on: Caldwell and Jorgeson set up camp as they begin their epic climb . President Obama posted this photo on Twitter congratulating the men in front of White House painting of El Capitan . But his fingers, worn down after days of climbing in the cold winter nights, were cracked and cut and he couldn't reach the hold the slighter Caldwell had already completed. Giving up crossed Jorgeson's mind, and he considered telling Caldwell to continue ahead without him. 'The idea of topping out without Kevin was something I didn't want to think about,' Caldwell told reporters. Fortunately, the weather stayed cold and dry, best for climbing because of the friction, and Caldwell said they would stay as long as they needed until Jorgeson could make the spread-eagle move. Jorgeson had the film crew following him splice together all his failures on pitch 15. He studied his mistakes, corrected his technique and made the difficult grab. 'Everything really had to come together for that to work out,' he said reflecting on the moment. 'You are just hanging there in silence and relief and joy and it's like the coolest feeling.'

"Education ministers and their staff 'lacked inquisitiveness' about fears of extremism in schools, a report warned today. The Department for Education has been told it needs to 'always be vigilant and inquisitive' after an internal review said the issue was not taken as seriously as concerns about child protection. Chris Wormald, the ministry's top official, was asked to carry out the review following the Trojan Horse allegations of a hardline Muslim takeover plot at a number of Birmingham schools. Chris Wormald, the permanent secretary at the Department for Education, said the ministry needed to have robust systems in place to play its part in preventing and dealing with the threat . To date there have been four other reports into allegations of extremism in Birmingham schools. None found evidence of a conspiracy violent extremism or radicalisation in schools in in the city, but they raised concerns about the role of governors in influencing policy and the promotion of an 'aggressive Islamic ethos'. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has stressed the importance of all schools teaching 'British values' of tolerance and free speech. Mr Wormald said he had found no instances of the Department for Education ignoring 'specific warnings' of extremism in schools but said it needed to have robust systems in place to play its part in preventing and dealing with the threat. He said that issues on extremism have been treated as 'one-offs' and assumed by the DfE to be the responsibility of other authorities. The review looked at the 20-year period between 1994 and December 2013 and any warnings received by the DfE relating to alleged extremism in Birmingham schools. It found that on a small number of occasions, the department received information about these issues, but concludes that these were largely dealt with 'in line with procedures in place at the time'. There were no instances in which ministers, officials or advisers acted inappropriately, the review adds. But it goes on to say that warnings were raised about issues such as difficult relationships between staff and governors in certain schools, the potential narrowing of a school curriculum and the fact that these issues 'have the potential to cause political, cultural and religious tensions in schools and their communities'. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has stressed the importance of all schools teaching 'British values' of tolerance and free speech . These matters are similar to those raised in Peter Clarke's report into the Trojan Horse situation, the review says. Mr Wormald concludes: 'Whilst I have not found instances of warnings having been ignored or of individuals having acted inappropriately, I have found that the Department has lacked inquisitiveness about this issue, and that procedures could have been tighter than they were. 'Whilst this is an easy thing to say in hindsight, there is a marked contrast between, for example, how the Department responds to reports of child protection issues and how it has historically responded to reports of potential extremism. 'Overall I find that in future the Department needs to be more vigilant, more inquisitive and have more robust systems in place than it has had in the past if in future it is to play its part in preventing and countering the issues identified in the Clarke Report.' In her response to the report, Mrs Morgan said she endorsed the findings and recommendations and that further measures are being taken. This includes introducing a formal system for staff to refer concerns about extremism to the Due Diligence and Counter Extremism Division and bringing in a formal case handling system within this division for logging and managing warnings. Mr Wormald added: 'Issues on extremism in Birmingham schools that have been raised with the Department have in general been assumed to be the responsibility of other authorities, and when they have been brought to the Department's attention have been dealt with as one-off pieces of transactional business. 'With hindsight, I believe the Department could have shown a greater level of inquisitiveness regarding these issues, and asked itself the question of whether the issues being brought to its attention were symptomatic of wider trends.' The review was prompted by the Trojan Horse letter in Birmingham in December 2013 and subsequent investigations by former anti-terror chief Mr Clarke, Ofsted and Ian Kershaw's inquiry for Birmingham City Council, which noted that warning signs about potential extremism in the city's schools had been missed by local agencies over a long period of time. The letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to seize control of a number of school governing boards in the city. In June, Ofsted issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of Birmingham's schools and declared five failing, placing them into special measures. Mr Clarke's report found no evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism but did conclude that there was ''clear evidence'' that there were a number of people, associated with each other and in positions of authority within some Birmingham schools who ''espouse, endorse or fail to challenge extremist views''. There were six instances where concerns were raised with the Department, the review found. Separately, there was also a letter sent to Lord Hill in March 2013, then leader of the House of Lords by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, which Lord Hunt said they discussed. The letter raised similar issues to those in the Clarke report. This letter was not formally part of Mr Wormald's review.","Department for Education told it must 'always be vigilant and inquisitive'

"Two volunteers including an Australian nurse have been airlifted back to the UK after potentially coming into contact with the Ebola virus while treating patients in Sierra Leone. Public Health England has described the decision to bring the two volunteers to the UK as a 'highly precautionary step'. Neither of the patients have been diagnosed with the deadly virus or are showing any symptoms of the disease. Scroll down for video . The Australian nurse was flown into Gatwick airport last night onboard an RAF jet before being taken to East Sussex hospital, pictured where she will be placed in isolation for the next 21 days . The nurse was transferred from Sierra Leone inside a 'bubble' to prevent any transmission of the virus . Public Health England said the nurse's protective equipment was damaged prompting her evacuation . The Australian nurse was flown back to the UK on an RAF flight while the second volunteer, who worked for a non-governmental organisation, is being returned on a private aircraft chartered by their employer. It is understood the nurse's protective clothing was punctured while in an Ebola hot-spot, but she is not believed to have come into direct contact with the virus. The second person, who is employed by a non-governmental organisation, was in contact with a health care worker who developed the disease. The pair will remain in isolation for the disease's 21-day incubation period. Dr Jenny Harries, regional director for PHE, said: 'The risk to the public posed by these and indeed any of the returning workers is extremely low. We are confident that all appropriate public health actions have been taken, and will continue to be taken, to support these individuals and to protect the public's health. 'It's important to remember, in choosing to volunteer, that these individuals have taken a courageous step not only to help those affected in West Africa, but also prevent the spread of Ebola any wider.' A second volunteer, who was working for an NGO is also being evacuated as a precaution, file photograph . Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, pictured, said the nurse had very 'low risk' of contracting Ebola . Meanwhile a patient admitted to hospital in Scotland yesterday after returning from Ebola-hit west Africa has tested negative for the killer virus. NHS Lothian said the patient, reported to be a woman, was screened for infection at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital after reporting a raised temperature, but tested negative. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said the Australian nurse will undergo observation in the United Kingdom following a 'low risk clinical incident' at the Australian-managed Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Sierra Leone. In a statement it said: 'The nurse was transferred to the United Kingdom consistent with the guarantees secured by the Australian government as a condition to establishing the treatment centre. 'The individual, who for privacy reasons has not been named, has not been diagnosed with Ebola, and her transferral to the UK for a 21-day observation period is a precautionary step. 'The Australian-funded ETC has strict infection prevention protocols in place, and the safety of staff and patients is paramount.' The ETC has a capacity of 38 beds and has so far seen 18 patients recover from the disease. A total of 825 health-care workers have been infected with Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone . Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey is still being treated for Ebola at London's Royal Free Hospital. The volunteer from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, is in a stable condition after being taken off the critical list this week. She remains in an isolation unit after contracting the disease while helping patients in Sierra Leone with Save the Children. The charity is investigating how Ms Cafferkey came to be infected. Following the latest incident the Scottish Government said: 'Scotland has a robust health protection surveillance system which monitors global disease outbreaks and ensures that we are fully prepared to respond to such situations.' A PHE spokesman said: 'It is important to remember that the infection can only be transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids - such as blood, vomit or faeces - of an infected person. 'We have advised all front-line medical practitioners and NHS call handlers to be alert to signs and symptoms of Ebola in those returning from affected areas and following such advice we would expect to see an increase in testing.' It is believed the Australian nurse was evacuated after she may have 'accidentally breached' clinical protocols. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop revealed that the nurse was airlifted from the Aspen Medical clinic at Hastings Airfield to the UK where she will undergo observation, but assured that the 'clinical incident' was one of 'low risk'. 'The individual, who for privacy reasons has not been named, has not been diagnosed with Ebola, and the transferral to the UK for a 21-day observation period is a precautionary step,' Ms Bishop said. 'The Australian-funded ETC has strict infection prevention protocols in place, and the safety of staff and patients is paramount.' Greens Senator Richard Di Natale, who visited the centre late last year, issued the following tweet after learning of the incident: 'My thoughts are with the Australian nurse evacuated from Sierra Leone after accidently breaching protocol. Hopefully nothing will come of it.' Although built by the UK, the Australian government have provided $23 million in funding to the treatment centre which is run by private Australian company Aspen. It currently holds 38 beds and is preparing to upgrade to a capacity of 50 by February. At least 57 patients have now been treated at the centre, 18 of whom have recovered and 22 of whom have died, the ABC reports. On January 6, the centre announced that they had successfully treated their first three survivors of the deadly virus, including an 11 year old girl, a man in his 20s and a 67 year old woman. 'Ms Aminata Bangura, 11 years old, was the first patient to be successfully treated by the Aspen Medical team,' the centre wrote in a statement. 'She has lost several family members to EVD. Aminata spent a total of eight days in the centre. Once diagnosed with EVD she received immediate life-saving treatment which involved antibiotics and anti-malarial drugs. A key aspect of her recovery was emotional support.' It went on say: 'The usual fatality rate for those over 45 years of age is 95 per cent, that we have been able to successfully treat a 67 year old woman is a very positive sign, operationally and clinically.' The clinic has now set up a 'wall of hope' for survivors to add their hand-prints before being discharged. More than 8,400 people have died after contracting Ebola across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organisation. 'A total of 825 health-care worker infections have been reported in the 3 intense-transmission countries; there have been 493 reported deaths,' WHO reports.","The nurse is believed to have accidentally breached clinical protocols .

Her father reached out to her on Facebook when she was in high school, and after the two met up she went to go stay with him for a week. They had sex that week, her first time, and were soon dating. 'There’s a reason I lost my virginity to him  because I’d never felt comfortable with any other man. It was insanely sensual,' she says. 'It lasted for about an hour and there was a lot of foreplay. We both had orgasms. We are so similar, so it’s so easy to sexually please each other. For example, we both love neck-biting. I’ve never been in a more passionate, loving, fulfilling situation.' The two are not even hiding their situation, with many around them aware of what is going on between them. 'Everyone on my mom’s side of the family sees us as father and daughter,' she explains. 'Those who know that he’s my dad, and that we are engaged, include my father’s parents (they can see we are happy together and they can’t wait for us to have babies  they treat us just like any other couple), the woman we live with, and my best friend.' The wedding has already been planned, and she will be telling her mother - after the two make the moved to New Jersey. 'We plan to move to New Jersey where we can be safe under the law, since adult incest isn’t illegal there, and once I’m there I’ll tell everyone,' she says. 'I’ll call my mom and let her know that we are in love and we are having children. If she wants to see her grandkids we’ll send her money and she can drive to see us.' And while many people, and science, may argue that having a child with a family member can lead to genetic problems, she scoffs at this notion. 'Everybody thinks that kids born in incestuous relationships will definitely have genetic problems, but that’s not true,' she explains. 'That happens when there’s years of inbreeding, like with the royal family. Incest has been around as long as humans have.' That being said, she says her chidlren will never learn how mommy and daddy first met. 'I don’t want to give them any problems,' she says.","An 18-year-old girl is revealing in a new interview that she has been dating her father for two years .

Euan Coulthard, a 19-year-old law student at St Mary's College, Durham, was reported missing by a friend yesterday afternoon. Mr Coulthard, who is from Nottingham, was last seen leaving a nightclub alone in the early hours of Thursday morning. The second-year 'model student' had been for an Italian meal on Wednesday evening to celebrate a friend's 21st birthday and went on to the Love Shack nightclub in the city centre. He has not responded to texts, emails or Facebook messages since leaving the club shortly after midnight, which is out of character, police said. Mr Coulthard is 5ft 9in, of average build with light brown hair, which is short on the sides and longer on the top. When he was last seen he was wearing black skinny jeans, a denim jacket and a beige patterned shirt. Around 200 students from Durham University met at 8am today to help search for Mr Coulthard. Lee Murray, 18, also from St Mary's College, was among the search party. The sports student said: 'We have been out since around 8am, there's around 100 of us left but earlier on there was double that. 'We all want to do our best to find Euan, he is a lovely lad who is really involved in the college socials, he loves cricket and everyone speaks about how liked he is. 'It's so tragic.

"China will monitor and rank incidents of misbehaviour by their  tourists abroad so that they can be  passed on to tour operators and travel agents, for them to decide whether to do business with them again, state media says. The program, put forward by China's National Tourism Administration (NTA), is designed to  curb incidents of violent or disruptive behaviour by mainland tourists while travelling or on holiday. NTA chairman Li Jinzao said that the information would be given to travel companies to allow them to decide 'whether to sell the person that ticket, or whether to let them take my flight,' according to South China Morning Post. Two passengers aboard a flight in China were jailed earlier this month after opening the plane’s emergency exit doors in protest at a lengthy delay . The new classification system will be launched in the second quarter and will also include information on the number of complaints received by attractions and hotels, how many had been dealt with and – of those that had been handled – how many customers had been satisfied with the outcome. The last few years have seen a string of embarrassing and high-profile incidents of bad behaviour by Chinese tourists, denting their reputation worldwide. During a flight from Bangkok to Nanjing last month a video went viral of a passenger scalding a Thai stewardess with hot water and noodles and threatening to blow up the plane after a heated exchange. At the time state media branded the group of mainline airline passengers involved 'barbarians' and four of the tourists have since been blacklisted by the provincial tourist board. China Eastern Airlines flight MU2036 travelling from Chengdu to Beijing was already seven hours behind schedule at 3:45am on Saturday morning because of snow when crew began to de-ice the plane at the Kunming airport . Just days later a plane was nearly forced to return after a brawl broke out between four women on a flight from mainland China to Hong Kong over a noisy baby. Also last month, a Chinese passenger on board an internal Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu sparked a safety scare by yanking open an emergency exit just before a plane was due to take off to 'get some fresh air', Southern Metropolis Daily reported. In December a brawl erupted on a board a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong over a woman's crying baby . In the same month a Chinese passenger on a China Eastern flight MU2331 from Xi’an opened an emergency slide because he wanted to get off the plane quicker . This isn't the first time that Chinese authorities have spoken out on the issue. Wang Yang, one of China's four vice premiers, gave a disparaging view of Chinese tourists in 2013. He said: 'They speak loudly in public, carve characters on tourist attractions, cross the road when the traffic lights are still red, spit anywhere and [carry out] some other uncivilized behavior. It damages the image of the Chinese people and has a very bad impact,' according to the Guardian. In 2013, the government introduced a new set of laws, primarily to regulate tour operators, including a clause advising Chinese tourists to behave well wherever they went in the world.","Program put forward by China's National Tourism Administration (NTA)

"This is the pregnant teenager who killed a police officer in a suicide bomb attack in Turkey. Islamic State jihadist Diana Ramazanova, 18, blew herself up while detonating grenades in front of the Istanbul tourism police station last week. Ramazanova, from Russia's Muslim region of Dagestan, is understood to have been the widow of an ISIS fighter killed six weeks ago in Syria. She married Abu Aluevitsj Edelbijev, a Norwegian citizen of Chechen origin, in a religious ceremony last year, either in Istanbul or in Syria, according to Turkish media. Family and friends said she had totally changed after meeting her extremist husband on a social networking site and then in Turkey. Her stepfather Magomed Ramazanov said: 'Before leaving for Turkey, she was not deeply religious. 'On the contrary, she was even depraved. In Moscow, Diana worked in the restaurant at the Kursk station. I always scolded her for wearing short skirts.' Scroll down for video . Radicalised: Pregnant teenager Diana Ramazanova (pictured far left and, right, with her ISIS jihadist husband Abu Aluevitsj Edelbijev) killed a police officer in a suicide bomb attack in Istanbul last week . Tabloid news site lifenews.ru also quoted a Moscow teacher as saying: 'I even rebuked her for wearing unsuitable clothes at school.' Russian and Turkish media have published pictures of Ramazanova before she was married, showing a seemingly normal girl who took good care of her appearance. But they were also quick to dub her a 'black widow', the label given to female suicide bombers from the Caucasus who carried out attacks after their husbands were killed by Russian security forces. Her mother Raizanat reportedly recognised the pictures of her daughter from Istanbul and has given a blood sample to enable DNA testing to confirm her identity. The Hurriyet daily newspaper claimed Ramazanova had entered Turkey on a tourist visa in May 2014, but Edelbijev may have entered the country illegally. Last July, the pair crossed the border from Turkey into Syria, joining ISIS jihadists who have seized large parts of Syria up to the Turkish border. He took the name of Idris while she became known as Sumeyra, it said. After his death in December, she crossed the border back into Turkey on 26 December and stayed for 11 days at the Kadikoy Bade Hotel. She had two hand grenades when she attacked the police station at Sultanahmet. The first grenade did not explode and when she took out the second police shot her. The second grenade killed her and an officer. Another officer was injured. Suicide bomber: Diana Ramazanova, 18, blew herself up while attempting to detonate grenades in front of the Istanbul tourism police station last week . Ramazanova, from Russia's Muslim region of Dagestan, was not seen as deeply religious, wore bright make up, dressed fashionably and attracted attention . Born in the mainly Muslim region of Dagestan in southern Russia, she had moved with her mother and stepfather, a builder, to Moscow. Magomed's relationship with his stepdaughter was described by Russian reports as strained. She was sent back to Dagestan where she graduated from a school in Derbent. After this, she returned to Moscow and worked as a shop assistant and in a restaurant. She was not seen as deeply religious and, say reports, wore bright make up, dressed fashionably, and attracted attention. Magomed said: 'Since June 2014 she has lived in Turkey. 'In the summer my wife and son and daughter went to the sea in Derbent. And when I came to them, my wife said that Diana had gone to Turkey for a holiday. 'I was still surprised that a young girl had gone there alone. It turned out she did not ask any permission. I did not know about her marriage. They hid this from me.' Russian media have been quick to dub Ramazanova a 'black widow', the label given to female suicide bombers from the Caucasus who carried out attacks in Russia after their husbands were killed by the Russian security forces . Russia media cited acquaintances of Ramazanova in Dagestan and Moscow as saying she had totally changed after meeting her extremist husband on a social networking site . Some reports say that her husband was from Chechnya and had lived as an emigre in Norway before moving to Istanbul. According to a source in the Turkish intelligence, Diana Ramazanova met with her husband - also named as Abu Edelbievym - through social networks, and in May 2014 came to Istanbul, where she saw him face to face him for the first time. The wedding ceremony took place in the mosque. According to the Turkish media, Edelbijev was a weightlifting champion in Norway at the age of 17. His father was also a well-known weightlifter in the USSR, it was reported. Islamic State militant: Ramazanov married Abu Aluevitsj Edelbijev (above), a Norwegian citizen of Chechen origin, in a religious ceremony last year, either in Istanbul or in Syria, according to Turkish media . According to Turkish intelligence, Ramazanova met her husband - also named as Abu Edelbievym - through social networks, and in May 2014 came to Istanbul, where she saw him face to face him for the first time . More recently, he became radicalised and showed sympathies for ISIS. He evidently entered Turkey illegally - there are no entry stamps - before spending three months with Diana in Istanbul from May. They made 'multiple' trips to Syria via Kilis and Gaziantep, it was reported. After her husband's death on December 26, Diana illegally crossed the Turkish-Syrian border, arriving first in Gaziantep and took a taxi to Istanbul - a distance of some is 1,140 km. How she obtained the money for the taxi is not known. Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that the local security services in Dagestan also believed Ramazanova had carried out the suicide bombing. Deadly: Forensic officers work at the scene of the suicide bombing in central Istanbul which killed one police officer and injured another . Attacked: The female suicide bomber went into the police station in the Sultanahmet district and told the police in English she had lost her wallet before setting off her charge . Hurriyet said security services are still trying to ascertain whether she brought her explosives with her from Syria or whether they had been given to her by a contact in Istanbul. If confirmed, the newspaper's information would make clear for the first time a jihadist link to the Istanbul suicide bombing. It also raises new questions about the laxity of Turkey's border security, which has already been criticised by Western states for allowing jihadists in and out of Syria. Lifenews also cited sources as saying she was the wife of Edelbijev who had died in Syria. Ramazanova's purported page on Russian social network VKontakte, with a profile picture of her eating a cake, gives her date of birth as January 10, 1996 and main interests as cinema and music. Specialist Russian website Kavkaski Uzel (Caucasian Knot) said that Istanbul had become a popular refuge for radically-minded Muslims from the Caucasus who were now fearing a crackdown on their presence.","Diana Ramazanova, 18, killed police officer in grenade attack in Istanbul .

Another journalist remarked that Tony Montana was the name of Al Pacino's character in Scarface. 'Yeah you watched it? Good movie,' he said, laughing.

"Ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's has drawn inspiration from one of 2014's most popular food fads, cookie butter, in order to create a new range of flavors which it believes are good enough to entice even the most dedicated baking enthusiast away from their oven. The new additions to the brand's 'core' range, a selection of ice creams which include a softer sweet center, are each based on a different cookie flavor. Spectacular Speculoos is described by Ben & Jerry's as 'dark caramel and vanilla ice creams with speculoos cookies and a speculoos cookie butter core'. The flavor is based on the same Belgian spiced shortbread biscuit which features heavily in most cookie butter varieties. But how did the ice cream compare to the cookies themselves? Scroll down for video . New flavor on the block: Ben & Jerry's new core collection features this speculoos flavor, which is based on a popular Belgian spiced biscuit . That's nuts! The Daily Mail Online editorial team were on the fence about the peanut butter offering, with some saying the rich peanut taste was too overwhelming . 'The Speculoos was the highlight for me – it’s got a slight cinnamon flavor, and I loved the textures of the smooth core, the crunchy cookie and the creamy ice cream together,' said US Femail Editor Tamara Abraham, before adding: 'I’d buy it in a heartbeat.' Femail reporter Erica Tempesta agreed. 'I love cookie butter so I love the fact that there is now an ice cream filled with it,' she said. 'I'm so glad that they've included it in the permanent line-up and I will definitely buy it again.' The Peanut Buttah variety was also commended on its authentic flavor, with many people marveling at the rich taste - and unique texture of the ice cream, which is described on the Ben & Jerry's website as being 'for peanut butter fans and cookie spread-heads who want it all'. According to Daily Mail Online's Senior Associate Photo Editor Kaitlinn Van Ert, that description hits the nail on the head. 'The peanut butter was my favorite. It felt like I was eating it straight from the jar and the cookie bits were little chunks of heaven that added a nice textural element.' But the rich peanut flavor didn't sit well with everyone. Picture Director Jolie Novak found the peanut taste slightly too 'overwhelming' and felt that it would have been better had it been paired with chocolate. Chocolate fix: The most popular of the three new flavors was the Boom Chocolatta, which features a delicious chocolate cookie core . Inspiration: Trader Joe's released these cookie butters last year, much to the delight of its cookie-loving customers . 'It was a bit too much peanut butter for me and I prefer it cut with the chocolate!' she said. 'It had nice sized chunks of peanut butter and was a bit more gooey than the other flavors, but paired with the peanut butter ice cream it was all a bit overwhelming.' Chocolate lovers will no doubt be pleased to hear that the new Ben & Jerry's core line-up also includes a cocoa-rich option too. The Boom Chocolatta, which is described by the brand as 'mocha and caramel ice creams with chocolate cookies, fudge flakes and a chocolate cookie core', proved to be the most popular flavor of the three, with US Editor Katherine Thomson describing it as 'heaven'. 'I would buy this again in a heartbeat,' she added. 'My go to has always been Phish Food but this beats it. I love the texture, and I love the harder chocolate bits. 'It’s delicious and not too chocolatey.' Contributing Femail Editor Olivia Fleming was in total agreement: 'I liked the chocolate the best – and as someone who would never choose chocolate-flavored ice cream, this is saying something. 'The brownie in the core melted in my mouth.'","The popular ice cream company has released three new flavors to its range: Spectacular Speculoos, Boom Chocolatta and Peanut Buttah .

"Elon Musk has released dramatic footage of the moment a SpaceX rocket crashed into a barge. The company's founder unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following its launch on Saturday. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Scroll down for video . Elon Musk has released footage of the moment a SpaceX rocket crashed into a barge. The company's founder unveiled the images after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack . Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. SpaceX has been developing technology to land the largest stage of its Falcon 9 rocket back on Earth after it takes its supplies to the ISS. Last Saturday's mission was the group's first attempt to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea, which was held in position using deep-sea oil rigs. While the launch went well, a failure in its hydraulic control fins brought the rocket down at the wrong angle. Earlier today Musk tweeted: 'Next rocket landing on drone ship in two to three weeks away more hydraulic fluid. At least it should explode for a different reason.' Saturday's mission was the group's first to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea, which was held in position using deep-sea oil rigs. Pictured is an image of the fuel and oxygen combining in an explosion . Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. SpaceX has been developing technology to land the largest stage of its Falcon 9 rocket back on Earth after it takes its supplies to the ISS . Recovering the rocket involved re-lighting its engines on re-entry for a series of three burns. The first were two adjusted the predicted landing point and reduce its speed from 4,265ft per second to 820ft per second. A final 'landing burn' slowed the speed further to around 6.5ft per second as the rocket lowers its landing legs. Four 'hypersonic grid fins' placed around the rocket were meant to deploye on re-entry. Each fin moves independently to help control roll, pitch and yaw. However, these malfunctioned, causing the crash. The modified barge - nearly the size of a football field - was positioned a couple hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast. The uncrewed platform was spared serious damage from the impact, although some equipment on deck will need to be replaced, according to Musk . Initially, Musk had insisted that the company didn't get good video of the impact, and that the team would have to piece together information from 'telemetry and … actual pieces'. In the weeks preceding the landing test, Musk had estimated there was a 50-50 chance, at best, that the Falcon's first-stage booster would land vertically on the platform. A pair of attempts last year to bring boosters down vertically on the open ocean went well, but company officials conceded before Saturday's try that a platform touchdown was considerably more challenging. Once separated from the upper stage of the rocket Saturday, the main booster re-ignited as planned for the fly back, according to SpaceX.

He issued the pictured after prompts from gaming pioneerjohn Carmack (right) SpaceX successfully launched a supply rocket to the International Space Station on Saturday, the sixth mission by the aerospace contractor to the station since 2012. However the landing wasn't as smooth . Automatic engine firings maneuvered the booster down toward the autonomous, modified barge. The Air Force maintained the ability, as always, to destroy the booster if it strayed off course. SpaceX's primary mission was delivering more than 5,000 pounds of station supplies ordered up by Nasa, including hasty replacements for experiments and equipment lost in the destruction of another company's cargo ships. The company, headquartered in Hawthorne, California, also has been contracted by Nasa to develop beefed-up Dragons for astronaut rides to the space station, beginning as early as 2017. Boeing also is hard at work on a manned capsule. In the meantime, Nasa is paying tens of millions of dollars to Russia for each U.S. astronaut launched aboard the Soyuz spacecraft. A barge floating off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, was supposed to recover the leftover booster, but components came down too hard and broke apart, according to SpaceX founder Elon Musk .

"By day he was an Amazon delivery driver, in his free time he transformed into a self-styled 'zombie hunter' who patrolled the streets in a decommissioned squad car. Now he is accused of being a killer who murdered random women for thrills. New details have emerged about the life of Bryan Miller who is accused of stabbing two Phoenix women to death in 1992. One of the women's body was found decapitated. Miller was an horror-obsessed fantasy enthusiast and a regular at events such as Comic Con and 'zombie walks' where he would indulge his alter ego. He was arrested in the cold-case killings of two women in1992 on Tuesday - and it has now emerged that he stabbed another women he met in 2002, but was let off when he claimed it was in self defense. Melissa Ruiz-Ramirez was out walking in Everett, Washington, on May 23 when she accepted a ride from a man whom she recognized from a friend's apartment complex. During the car ride, they talked about how some of the trails and pathways near that complex were dangerous, before Miller allegedly took Ruiz-Ramirez to his work and stabbed her in the back with a 12-inch serrated knife. Scroll down for video . Alter ego: Bryan Miller would patrol the streets of Phoenix as the 'zombie hunter' Violent past: Bryan Patrick Miller, 42 - who was arrested Tuesday for a 22-year-old grisly double murder case and had a Facebook page calling himself 'The Arizona Zombie Killer' (pictured) - was acquitted of a separate stabbing in 2002, it has been revealed . Strange: Miller, a 'zombie hunter' and compulsive hoarder, was busted in connection with two horrific murders of young women that terrified the Phoenix area in 1992 and 1993 . Arrested: Miller, a father-of-one, lists himself on Facebook as a driver for Amazon who loves zombies . However the charges against Miller were dropped after he argued that Ruiz-Ramirez had tried to rob him. He moved back to Arizona shortly afterward and quietly resumed his life. That is until his dramatic arrest on Tuesday. It has also been revealed that, in high school, Miller randomly stabbed a woman at a Phoenix mall but only served time until age 18, Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump said. The Washington state case didn't require him to submit a DNA sample because he was exonerated. Miller, who was reportedly obsessed with horror and fantasy, had a decommissioned police car he acquired in Washington and would drive around Pheonix calling himself 'The Arizona Zombie Hunter'. He set up a Facebook page specifically for his hobby, which he described as: 'Keeping Arizona safe from the things that go bump in the night. Also available for your event.' DNA evidence recently collected by undercover officers now ties the divorced father to the slayings of Angela Brosso, 22, and 17-year-old Melanie Bernas. The women disappeared 11 months apart while riding their bikes through Phoenix. Miss Brosso was killed in November 1992 and her body was found shortly after she went missing. Her decapitated head was found 11 days later in the Arizona Canal. Bernas' body was discovered about 1 ½ miles away floating in the water in September 1993. Her turquoise bodysuit was discovered nearby. She had also been riding near the canal. Unsolved: Angela Brosso, 22, and 17-year-old Melanie Bernas were murdered 11 months apart while riding their bike through Phoenix Arizona in the early 1990s. Police finally made an arrest this week . Scene: Phoenix Police Crime Response Unit members inspect the house of a Bryan Patrick Miller, the suspect of at least two 1992 murders of two young women in Arizona . New evidence: Police are expected to spend several days combing through Miller's home . Investigation: Miller's alleged victims had both disappeared riding bikes near the Amazon Canal in Phoenix . Social media: According to Miller's Facebook page he is a father of one, works as a driver for Amazon, likes Zombie films and conventions and recently embarked on a relationship . Investigators took six months to link the killings through forensic evidence and failed to make a breakthrough until Tuesday, when they Miller on two counts of first-degree murder and kidnapping and one count of sexual assault. Police said they tied the case to Miller through DNA, but refused to say how they obtained the sample. Police continued to comb through Miller's home near North Mountain Park on Thursday and are likely to be there for several days. So far, there is no evidence that Miller knew either victim, Crump said. A bike was found in a shed in Miller's backyard, but Crump said it wasn't immediately clear if it belonged to either victim. Neither of the women's bikes - Brosso's purple, 21-speed Diamondback nor Bernas's green SPC Hardrock Sport - has ever been found, suggesting the killer may have kept them as trophies. Miller appeared in court Wednesday without an attorney. According to police, he denied any involvement in the killings during a police interview. He acknowledged living in the vicinity at the time of the murders and that he rode his bike on the bike paths. Jason Brosius, who worked with Miller at the time of his assault arrest in Everett, said he never saw Miller exhibit any strange behavior. 'He was kind of a quiet person but he wasn't anymore quiet than anybody else,' said Brosius, who still works at the same company, a provider of truck accessories. 'He didn't show any crazy, weird flags to me. He seemed pretty square.' Brosius recalled how Miller moved right after his acquittal without saying much to anyone. Crime scene investigators admit they were traumatized by the sheer brutality of the 1990s murders. 'It's the most brutal murder we've probably ever had,' said William Schira, a Phoenix detective on the cold-case squad . Archive: The murders in Phoenix in 1992 and 1993 - crime scene pictured here - terrified the city . Shocking: The disappearance and then discovered of the two victims bodies frightened the area . Shocking: Angela Brosso, 22, was killed in November 1992 and her body was found shortly after she went missing. Her decapitated head was found 11 days later in the Arizona Canal . 'He came back here, collected his personal stuff and that was the last anybody saw of him,' Brosius said. 'He said he was going back to Arizona, and that was it.' Police said the killer probably had special military training due to the speed and brutality of the women's executions. 'It's the most brutal murder we've probably ever had,' said William Schira, a Phoenix detective on the cold-case squad said in 2012. Phoenix police and the Cold Case Homicide Unit launched a fresh appeal for information that year, hoping someone who lived in the area may recall anything unusual among their neighbours. 'We're calling on the public who lived in that area at the time to think: 'Who had specialized training and might have seemed a little off?',' said Phoenix police Sgt Troy Hillman at the time. It is not known whether Miller's arrest was made as a result of that inquiry. Zombie Hunter: Miller appears to have been obsessed with horror and fantasy and would attended fan conventions in a decommissioned police car, which he called 'The Arizona Zombie Hunter' According to Miller's Facebook page he is a father of one, works as a driver for Amazon, likes Zombie films and conventions and recently embarked on a relationship. A recent posting read: 'I have had to deal with some if the worst rejections you can imagine and some that were exceptionally cruel.. I am awkward when it comes to a lot of social aspects of my life'. Another in October last year read: 'My birthday is on friday and normally I dread my birthday because of well 'reasons', but this year I have decided to celebrate my birthday the entire month of October. Seeing friends, concerts, food, car-related events, and just trying to enjoy things more, and this weekend I have the zombie walk and an extra day off and then next week is Halloween and Fearcon.'","Bryan Patrick Miller, 42, was arrested Tuesday in Phoenix for a double- murder cold case .

"ISIS has murdered 17 men in Syria over the past two days according to a human rights monitoring organisation as the terror group struggles to keep hold of its self-proclaimed caliphate. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the victims were either beheaded or shot in response to a series of hit-and-run guerrilla-style attacks on the terror group which killed ten terrorists. ISIS is being attacked on several fronts by forces loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, rival insurgent groups as well as coalition airstrikes. Scroll down for video . ISIS has been executing civilians in Syria in response to guerrilla attacks on the terror group . Human rights activists said 17 civilians have been killed by ISIS in the Deir  al-Zor province in recent days . The men were blindfolded and led to the centre of a public square where they were shot or beheaded . The terror group, who claims to control large sections of Syria and Iraq has been hit in its stronghold of the Deir al-Zor province, from Raqqa, down as far as the town of al-Mayadin, along the banks of the River Euphrates. Syrian state news agency SANA reported that ISIS executed three civilians in al-Mayadin, before putting their bodies on public display. The United Nations believes that more than 200,000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war over the past four years. Syrian media claims that the attacks on ISIS, which have not been claimed by any particular group or state agency are part of a 'popular resistance' to the terror group. Meanwhile Turkey's prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said his country may increase the size of militarised zones along the country's border with Syria to prevent western Jihadi tourists from joining ISIS. He said: 'On the border, up to now, there are refugee camps, there are certain places where there is much more strict control. 'These military zones might be enlarged,"" Davutoglu said, adding that Turkey had so far been reluctant to do this so as not to deter refugees. 'The source of the problem is the Assad regime's brutality ... (We want a) no-fly zone ... so that Aleppo will be protected at least against the air bombardment and there will be no new refugees coming to Turkey.'

"The air on Earth was a toxic soup of chemicals for almost two billion years as life was evolving on the planet, according to new research. Scientists have found the oldest evidence for what our planet's atmosphere was like 4 billion years ago, just 600 million years after the Earth first took shape. By analysing the different levels of isotopes trapped inside some of the oldest rocks in the world, they were able to build up a picture of what the air was like at the time. Researchers studied chemicals from the early atmosphere trapped in rocks in Hudson Bay, Quebec (above) They found that the Earth's early atmosphere contained oxygen levels that were far lower than they were today and were even lower than scientists had previously believed. The study also suggests that the atmosphere may have contained considerably more sulphur dioxide, more methane gas and carbon dioxide than it does today. The Earth's atmospehre was almost entirely oxygen free when it first formed. It took billions of years before there was enough of this gas around to support oxygen-breathing life. Geological evidence suggests that around 2.6 billion years ago there was a dramatic shift in the composition of the Earth's atmosphere as the amount of oxygen it contained rocketed. Experts believe that around 3 billion years ago a new type of microbe appeared on the Earth that had not been there before. These bacteria were capable of harnessing the sun's energy to power chemical reactions known as photosynthesis. This allowed them to use carbon dioxide and water to grow and they gave off oxygen as a waste material. As these hugely successful bacteria spread, oxygen levels began to rise. Indeed it is thought that oxygen became so abundant that many of these early bacteria died off, poisoned by its presence as other forms of oxygen breathing life evolved to take their place. The composition is almost identical the chemical fingerprints found in rocks that formed around 2-3 billion years ago. The results suggest that the atmosphere of our planet remained almost unchanged as the first bacteria began to appear and these may have controlled the atmosphere. It could provide new clues as to what the first life was like on Earth and how it evolved. Dr Boswell Wing, a geologist at McGill University who oversaw the research, said: 'Those younger rocks contain clear signs of microbial life. 'One interpretation is that biology controlled the composition of the atmosphere on early Earth, with similar microbial biospheres producing the same atmospheric gases from Earth’s infancy to adolescence. 'We can’t rule out, however, the possibility that the biosphere was decoupled from the atmosphere. 'In this case geology could have been the major player in setting the composition of ancient air, with massive volcanic eruptions producing gases that recurrently swamped out weak biological gas production.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analysed rocks from an area known as the Nuvvuagituq Greenstone Belt in Porpoise Bay, Hudson Bay, northern Quebec, Canada. Using mass spectrometery they were able to measure the levels of sulphur isotopes trapped inside the rocks when they were created. The Nuvvuagituq Greenstone Belt is thought to be between 3.7 billion and 4.2 billion years old. The Earth is thought to have formed around 4.6 billion years ago and the first signs of life is thought to have appeared around 4 billion years ago. Sulphur isotopes in the crystals of the rock in the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt (above) allowed the scientists to analyse what the Earth's atmosphere was like when the rock was forming around 4 billion years ago . Porpoise Bay (above), which sits within Hudson Bay, Quebec, is home to some of the oldest rocks in the world . The result suggested that oxygen levels were just 20 per cent of the levels today, making up just 0.0002 per cent of the atmosphere. This is far lower than previous estimates, which have said said oxygen made up around 0.01 per cent of the atmosphere. Oxygen currently makes up about 21 per cent of the gases in the atmosphere. Previous work by the researchers also looked at the composition of rocks that were between 2 to 3 billion years old, showed they had similar levels of sulphur. Many palaeobiologists believe that the first life to appear on Earth were bacteria capable of living in the harsh environments that existed around 4 billion years ago. They would have been similar to the 'extremophile' bacteria that are found living around volcanic vents and acidic hot springs today. Ancient archaebacteria similar to this Sulfolobus acidicaldarious, which can grow in temperatures of 70 degrees Celsuis and acid with pH2, would have been able to survive the harsh conditions in the early Earth . It is thought that as these bacteria evolved, they became able to photosynthesis and began producing oxygen around 2.6 billion years ago. This then led to a fundamental change in the atmosphere, allowing the life that needs oxygen to live to develop. Dr Emilie Thomassot, a geologist led the research and now works at the Centre de Recherches Pétrographiques et Géochimiques (CRPG) in Nancy France, said: 'We found that the isotopic fingerprint of this atmospheric cycling looks just like similar fingerprints from rocks that are a billion to 2 billion years younger. 'This unusual atmospheric fingerprint has been present since the end of the Hadean, the earliest eon of Earth history.'","Geologists at McGill University studied sulphur isotopes trapped in rocks .

"Woolworths has reduced its 24-pack of Homebrand thin sausages to $6.95 . In an unexpected move, that can only indicate summer barbeques are in full swing across the country, two supermarket giants have declared a sausage price-war. Woolworth reduced its 1.8kg 24-pack of Homebrand thin sausages to $6.95 from just under $12 on Friday, bringing the price of each sausage down to 29 cents. Aldi will now also bring their sausage 24-packs down to $6.89 as of Saturday, according to Fairfax. All eyes are now on Coles, whose 1.7kg pack of thin sausages so far remains firmly set at $7. The bulk-sausage price slash comes only a few months after Woolworths led the supermarket giants in lowering its home-brand bread price to 85 cents. Although met with praise from consumers, the decision was slammed by the Baking Association of Australia and many independent bakeries which feared they would struggle to compete. Many claimed that it was the quality of full priced products that would save the privately owned businesses, a statement that is likely to be repeated by local butchers in the latest price-war. Woolworths' head of trading for meat, Jim Stephan, guaranteed that  the latest drop in sausage prices were permanent. The move has encouraged Aldi to reduce their 24-packs of sausages to as little as $6.89 . He told Fairfax that the prices were introduced just in time for Australia day. 'Aussies love their sausages, especially over the summer holidays, so we wanted to help our customers enjoy a great family barbecue that includes ... quality food at a great price,' Mr Stephan said. Milk has also been the topic of war for the chains in the last few years, with one litre of milk currently costing only $1.25 in Woolworth and Coles and 85 cents in Aldi.

"A businessman who stabbed to death a cousin of Ranulph Fiennes with a pair of scissors in a crazed attack has denied murder, claiming he was insane at the time. James Fiennes - second cousin of Arctic explorer Sir Ranulph - was having a drink in an upmarket tapas restaurant when a man went 'out of his mind' and repeatedly plunged the blades into his body. As assailant Nicholas Hunter was tackled by a former police officer, the 49-year-old victim collapsed to the floor. He underwent emergency surgery in hospital but died five hours later. Nicholas Hunter, pictured right, who stabbed to death a cousin of Ranulph Fiennes, left, with a pair of scissors in a crazed attack has denied murder . Nicholas Hunter, 37, today pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Fiennes and to threatening to kill Thomas Ollsen on April 22 last year at the restaurant in Mortlake, south west London. He does not deny the attack but his defence rests on the claim he was 'insane' when he launched himself at his victim. Speaking during the hearing at the Old Bailey, Judge Wendy Joseph said: 'His defence is he was insane at the time. 'If this is not accepted in relation to the murder charge he will bring up the question of diminished responsibility.' Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and blue tie, Hunter of Rodenhurst Road, Clapham, appeared via video link from Broadmoor Psychiatric Hospital. He pleaded not guilty to both charges in a loud voice. James Fiennes was having a drink in an upmarket tapas restaurant, pictured, when a man went 'out of his mind' and repeatedly stabbed him . Prosecutor Zoe Johnson said: 'He has been judged fit to plead. A trial date has been set for March 16 which is expected to last seven days. 'It is clear there are complex mental health issues. 'The defence will not be making large admissions, apart from the odd point of discussion. The trial will rest on issues of mental health.' Psychiatric reports are being prepared on behalf of the prosecution and defence and will be ready before the trial. Judge Joseph told the defendant: 'You will be tried on March 16 of this year. Until then you will be kept at the hospital you are being treated at.'

"A controversial app inspired by the hit Disney animation Frozen enables users to perform a Caesarean on Princess Anna, one of the movie's title characters. Anna Giving Birth, which is the work of software designer Oleg Vinogorodov, is an unlicensed - and unofficial - Frozen app which claims to pick up where the popular animated movie left off, nine moths after Anna is thought to have married her love interest Kristoff. 'Anna got married and she was pregnant in the spring,' the app's description explains. 'Now nine months had elapsed, and it's time to give birth to a baby. Scroll down for video . Mother-to-be: Anna Giving Birth claims to pick up where Disney's hit animated movie Frozen left off . Operation: Users are asked to perform a C-section on Princess Anna . Newborn baby: When the baby has been delivered, users must then cut its umbilical cord . 'Anna needs a very experienced doctor to help her deliver her baby. Let's come to help her!' Players of the game are asked to take on the role of the doctor, and begin by monitoring the baby's heartbeat using the app's 'fetus egg monitor'. Then, after Anna's stomach has been treated with a bizarre freezing spray, users are instructed to pick up a scalpel and perform her C-section. A baby then appears on Anna's stomach, before the app prompts you to cut its umbilical cord with the same scalpel that was used to perform the original procedure. You then weigh and wrap the genderless child, whose genitals are covered with what appears to be three small starfish, and then hand it back to its delighted parents, Anna and Kristoff. The app has, unsurprisingly, sparked outrage on social media, with many parents taking to Twitter to voice their concerns about such a graphic game being connected to one of the world's most popular children's movies. Bouncing baby: The genderless child is then weighed and measured . Bundled up: After the baby is finished at the 'hospital' users are then invited to wrap he or she up ready to return to its parents . Proud parents: The app finishes with the baby being delivered safely home with Anna and Kristoff . 'PEOPLE OF THE TWITTER: please do not download or play [Anna Giving Birth] it will ruin Frozen and scar you for life,' tweeted @kerstin_landry, while @teaganjaee added: 'Anna Giving Birth is so disturbing.' It seems that some people have found humor in the controversial app however, with many opting to post what appear to be parody reviews on the game's iTunes page, no doubt in the hopes of eliciting further frustration from any concerned parents. 'This app has changed the way I look at the world,' one review reads. 'I remember it vividly; I smuggled my phone into jail after being arrested... 'I needed a way to pass time faster so I downloaded this app. My inmates made fun of me and I almost thought about deleting the app but thank God I didn't... This app gave me faith not only in humanity, but in myself. My inmates say that after this app, I became a fatter, man version of Mother Teresa. 'The real training this application gave me was used one ordinary day in jail.

"Rights campaigner Peter Tatchell warned LGBT Youth North West's plans for a school for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender children was not a good idea . Gay rights campaigners have criticised plans for Britain’s first school for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender children. A taxpayer-funded youth group wants to set up a school for pupils 13 and older who are being bullied because of their sexuality. LGBT Youth North West denied that the school would be a ‘ghetto’ for gay youngsters and said mainstream schools can be ‘one of the last bastions of homophobia’. But critics said the move would amount to segregation and would ‘foster division’. Rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ‘For some vulnerable young gay kids who have been badly bullied because of their sexuality, it might be good to temporarily take them out of the mainstream school system so they can study in a safe secure environment. 'But in the long term separate schooling is not a good idea. The real way to deal with homophobic bullying is not to take kids out of schools, but to stop the bullying and educate pupils on gay understanding and acceptance.’ Ruth Hunt, of gay rights group Stonewall, said LGBT-only schools were not the answer, adding: ‘Our experience working with more than 12,000 schools … shows that it is possible to create safe and inclusive environments where all pupils can be themselves. ‘This makes the learning environment better for all students – regardless of their sexual orientation – and is key to eradicating homophobia in every single school in Britain.’ Tory MP Graham Stuart, chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee, said care was needed to ensure the free school movement does not lead to ‘segregation’. He said his concerns about the plans were: ‘First, what this says about the treatment of gay children in some mainstream schools, and why this isn’t being more effectively addressed, and second … LGBT schools may reduce rather than reinforce the need for all schools to be inclusive of every type of pupil.’ Ukip’s education spokesman, Paul Nuttall, said: ‘This idea does nothing but foster division … it is utterly bizarre to be taking a step that highlights differences.’ LGBT Youth North West’s Amelia Lee said her organisation has carried out a survey of gay, lesbian and transgender young people which found many felt teachers had been unsupportive and in some cases simply urged them to ‘ignore’ bullying. She said mainstream schools struggle to tackle bullying of gay pupils, adding: ‘Schools can be one of the last bastions of homophobia.’ The youth group's  plans for Britain's first all-LGBT school (posed by model left) has also been criticised by Tory MP Graham Stuart, chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee, who said care was needed to ensure the free school movement does not lead to ‘segregation’ The group is using a grant for £63,000 from the Department for Communities and Local Government to pay for a feasibility study into setting up the school at the Joyce Layland LGBT Centre in central Manchester. But a source close to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘There is simply no way that we will approve a free school specifically for LGBT young people.’ The source added that all pupils should be in mainstream schools ‘which should be equipped to tackle any bullying’. Miss Lee said the proposed school would also be open to heterosexual pupils and to those questioning their sexuality.","LGBT group  wants to set up a school for pupils bullied for their sexuality .

"For centuries, ships navigated the globe propelled by large sails - and one firm is hoping to return to this way of life, albeit it with a hi-tech twist. A Norwegian engineer has designed a radical new cargo ship with a hull so large it acts as the sails of old. Called Vindskip, the hull on the concept would act as a so-called giant airfoil to harness power from the wind and lift and propel the ship forward, while onboard software would constantly monitor weather forecasts to choose the best course possible. Scroll down for video . The Vindskip (pictured), designed by Lade AS, uses a hull designed to act as a so-called airfoil, or giant sail. The makers of the wind-powered hybrid merchant ship said that while engines are still needed, their design could achieve fuel savings of 60% while reducing emissions by 80% . The makers of the wind-powered hybrid merchant ship said that while engines are still needed, their design could achieve fuel savings of 60 per cent, and reduce emissions by 80 per cent. The software is being developed by Germany's Fraunhofer Center for Maritime Logistics and Services, and the concept ship was designed by Terje Lade, from Lade AS. Fraunhofer's software will monitor the wind conditions and calculate the best route for the ship, by comparing real-time meteorological information to calculate wind energy. 'With this software, you input when you want to leave and when you want to arrive, the weather forecast is loaded into the program and then it calculates the best route,' Lade told CNN. The relative wind is given by the ship's course and speed, and the direction and strength of the True Wind. True wind is the wind measured on board a stationary ship. When the ship starts moving, the apparente wind is  generated. The Wind Power System of Vindskip uses this apparent wind to generate a 'positive force in the longitudinal direction of the ship', described as 'the angle of attack'. The ship can then be repositioned to take advantage of this wind propulsion. Special software will monitor the wind conditions and calculate the best route for the ship, by comparing real-time meteorological information to calculate wind energy. This data will be constantly tracked and updated to make sure the ship stays on course to arrive on time. 'This would be dynamically updated every day. 'At each waypoint it would check with the time arrival and tell the crew whether to speed up using the engines or slow down; it makes it very easy for the crew.' The relative, or apparent, wind is given by the ship's course and speed, and the direction and strength of the true wind. True wind is the wind measured on board a stationary ship. When the ship starts moving, the apparent wind is  generated. The Wind Power System of Vindskip uses this apparent wind to generate a 'positive force in the longitudinal direction of the ship', described as 'the angle of attack'. This generates a lift, which creates propulsion, and the ship can be repositioned to take advantage of this wind propulsion. The ship would also use a liquefied natural gas-powered (LNG) electrical generator for the remainder of its energy, and to get it going from a standstill. 'Over time, the contribution of the ship's Wind Power System to the actual propulsion of the ship will vary' continued the firm. 'However, a Cruise Control will balance the LNG-electric propulsion system so it works  with the Wind Power System - keeping a constant speed of the ship.' This control will adjust the pitch on the propeller, as well the rotations per minute, making it possible to use fuel more efficiently. The design of the Vindskip has a large opening for cargo, and lifeboats that drop from a 'lip' around the top of the boat if needed. The firm also said the design, which draws inspiration from the aerospace industry to create the 'symmetrical airfoil' hull, could eventually be used for giant cruise ships.

The captain would input when they want to arrive, and the weather forecast would be loaded to calculate the best route . 'The relative wind is a crucial factor in designing aircrafts, trains, propellers and sailing boats. But for the design of commercial vessels, this is a revolutionary brand new way of thinking,' explained Lade AS. 'Inspired by the aerospace industry and the sailboat environment, the Vindskip is designed to utilise wind for propulsion. The unique element is the shape of the hull, both above and below the water line.' The firm has begun offering the design and technology to consultancies, ship owners and ship yards for licensing, but it is not known when a fully-functioning Vindskip will be made. During a journey, the route would be updated daily, and at each waypoint, the software would check arrival time. It would then tell the crew to speed up using the engines, or slow down. This GIF shows how the direction could change day-by-day, and how this would theoretically affect fuel consumption .

The impressive vessel crossed the Atlantic in a record breaking 22 days in 2013. when it travelled from Las Palmas, Canary Islands to Saint Martin in the Caribbean. The catamaran, which is a scientific research platform for the University of Geneva (UNIGE), has a top speed of 14 knots and has 809 solar panels that can generate up to 480 kWh on a sunny day. The Vindskip was inspired by merchant sailing ships (stock image of the clipper Star of India) as well as airfoils used in the aerospace industry to lift aircraft and travel forward, using wind power and built-in engines .","A Norwegian firm designed the concept, which could achieve fuel savings of 60% while reducing emissions by 80% .

"An anti-ISIS rebel commander in Syria gave a rousing speech to his assembled men standing behind a Hello Kitty note pad. The leader, named on the YouTube video as Zahran Alloush implored his men to fight the 'evil ideology' of ISIS accusing them of trying to 'destroy jihad in Syria'. The video shows Alloush addressing up to 100 fighters on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus. Scroll down for video . Zahran Alloush looks every inch a Syrian rebel commander as he stands, wearing desert camouflage fatigues, in front of his band of rebel fighters with a semi-automatic handgun strapped to his side . However, Alloush's martial image is somewhat diminished by the Hello Kitty notepad, circled, on his desk . Alloush warned his fighters of the dangers posed by ISIS accusing them of trying 'to destroy jihad in Syria' ISIS, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had earlier called a 'caliphate' in parts of Syria and Iraq in a further bid to destabilise the troubled region. Alloush branded ISIS as 'khawarij', which is a term for a group of people who have rebelled against the acknowledged Muslim ruler. According to a note attached to the YouTube video, Alloush told his fighters: 'This group of khawarij, the gang of [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi ... tried to destroy jihad in Afghanistan, in Chechnya, in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Iraq. They have now come to try and destroy jihad in Syria.' He then warned his men over the threat posed by ISIS, using the example of the killing of Abul Miqdam: 'They forced him to the ground and slit his throat.' Alloush also criticised the number of non-Syrians fighting with ISIS accusing them of having little regard for civilians. He added: 'They are dirty b*******, with an evil ideology.' Meanwhile, 30 ISIS fighters broke out of a makeshift jail where they were being held by rival Syrian Islamists, it has emerged. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed heavy fighting in the village of al-Hawaaj. ISIS, which has declared a caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq, includes thousands of foreign fighters and has become the main recruiting magnet for jihadi volunteers from Europe and North Africa. The Observatory said the 30 fighters that escaped on Friday were all Syrian. The group is now considered the most potent insurgent band in Syria and its rivals complain that it spends more time fighting them than Syrian army forces. It also captured the villages of Quniya and Buqris in the Deir al-Zor province from Nusra late on Thursday, the Observatory said. The villages are close to the town of Mayadin, which ISIS seized earlier in the day. It is claimed that ISIS now controls an area five times larger than neighbouring Lebanon.","Zahran Alloush warned his men that ISIS was trying 'to destroy Syrian jihad'

"He is the kind-faced dog that stole the nation's heart after being abandoned in a railway station because of a painful eye condition. But after undergoing an operation, Kai the Shar-Pei is in good health - and on the lookout for a new owner. The  animal was found tied up in Ayr train station on January 2 looking forlorn next to a suitcase of his belongings. Scroll down for video . Kai the Shar-Pei was abandoned in Ayr rail station earlier this month. The animal has undergone eye surgery since being discovered by the SSPCA, and is now recovering in their care . He had been left there by Fin Rayner from Aberdeen, who says she was tricked into buying him after seeing an advert on Gumtree. Following a police appeal, thousands shared their sympathy for Kai's plight online and inundated the Scottish SPCA with offers to take him home. Animal lovers also raised enough money to pay for the mongrel to undergo surgery to correct a condition which made his eyelashes curl inside his eyelids. Carers are considering a short list of applicants while Kai makes his recovery, but they are confident he will be re-homed soon. The operation was a success, with Kai now recovering in the care of SSPCA vets. 'He’s had the operation on both eyes, which was very successful, and he is just going through the healing process just now. 'It’s looking really good for him. He needs to wear the collar just so he doesn’t scratch them. 'He is really coming on. He’s very friendly and he has really been an asset to the society,' said Sharon Bruce, senior animal care assistant. Carers were inundated with requests to re-home the dog after he was discovered with a suitcase of his belongings in the train station . Kai had been listed as for sale on Gumtree, and left with an owner who did not want to look after him . The dog suffered a condition which caused his eyelashes to curl under his lids. Fin Rayner (right), the woman who left him tied up in Ayr, said she did nothing wrong . The Scottish SPCA said it was overwhelmed with requests to take Kai home and is reviewing a shortlist of applicants while he recovers from the operation . The animal was discovered in Ayr rail station earlier this month after being tied up by Ms Rayner, a mother-of-three. The 39-year-old had travelled from Aberdeen after seeing an advert of a dog on Gumtree, but claims Kai was not the animal listed for sale. After telling his seller she wanted to take him for a walk to test his temperament, Ms Rayner claims to have suddenly found herself responsible for him when the seller drove away. Unsure what to do, she decided to leave him at the rail station where she was boarding a train back to Aberdeen. The mother-of-three previously said she did nothing wrong. An investigation has been launched into how the animal came to be bought and sold online and he will star in a PETA campaign warning against such transactions.

"A New Jersey man has somehow survived ingesting 30 bags of heroin - or so he claims - while being chased down by police following an attempted robbery. Michael Pelissier, 42, is accused of breaking into the Petco store on Route 17 north around 2.30am Tuesday. Officers saw a suspicious 2004 Dodge Ram pickup pull out from behind the store and say Pelissier and another man, Robert Kwiatkowski, 52, were inside. A plate check on the truck showed its plates were bogus and it had been stolen one week prior, according to NJ.com. Destorying the evidence: Michael Pelissier, 42 (left), accused of breaking into a Petco store early Tuesday with accomplice Robert Kwiatkowski, 52 (right), and then eating 30 bags of heroin as police chased him down . When cops flickered their sirens at the vehicle, the pair quickly pulled over and started running. Police caught both of them after a brief chase. As they were arresting Pelissier, he told police he had just swallowed 30 bags of heroin. Pelissier was then taken to Bergen Regional Medical Center. Doctors were able to remove the bags from Pelissier without any of them breaking, which could have been fatal. Inside the pickup police found more heroin and hypodermic needles. They also recovered large spools of copper wire and an assortment of power and hand tools. Scene: The two had allegedly broken into the Petco store on Route 17 north in Jersey around 2.30am Tuesday . The two were booked into Bergen County Jail. They have been charged with receiving stolen property, possession of heroin and possession of narcotics paraphernalia. Pelissier also was charged with eluding police.","Michael Pelissier, 42, accused of breaking into a Petco store early Tuesday .

"Investigators say a police officer who killed a man while patrolling a rural Colorado community shot him in the back after stopping him on the street and following him home even though the man wasn't an imminent threat. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation found James Ashby aggressively pursued Jack Jacquez, 27, after stopping him Oct. 12, according to court documents released Thursday. The bureau's investigation concluded Ashby fatally shot Jacquez even as Jacquez was moving away. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation found James Ashby aggressively pursued Jack Jacquez, 27, after stopping him Oct. 12, according to court documents released Thursday . Jacquez was skateboarding on a street when the officer approached him. Ashby said Jacquez cursed at him and walked erratically before heading toward the yard of what turned out to be his house. Ashby told authorities he suspected Jacquez was trying to burglarize the home. He also said he thought Jacquez was getting ready to strike him with a baseball bat. However, the officer's account was contradicted by the evidence and a man who was doing a ride-along with him that night, according to Ashby's arrest affidavit. Ashby was fired after being arrested in the shooting. His lawyer did not return a call seeking comment. The ride-along witness, Kyle Moore, said Jacquez said something about going home when Ashby stopped him. Jacquez did not use an expletive, Moore said, and he walked straight toward the home after talking with the officer. Ashby told authorities he was standing near an entrance to Jacquez's house when he shot Jacquez, who was inside the house holding a bat that he grabbed after entering. Jacquez was skateboarding on a street when the officer approached him. Ashby said Jacquez cursed at him and walked erratically before heading toward the yard of what turned out to be his house . The officer said he feared Jacquez was 'loading up'  to strike him in the head with the bat. However, the autopsy showed Jacquez was fully facing away from Ashby when he was shot, and his body couldn't have been turned in a way to get ready to strike the officer, according to the affidavit. Moore didn't witness the shooting but said he heard Ashby yelling at Jacquez to show his hands and to drop a bat. The shooting prompted demonstrations in the city on Colorado's southeastern plains. Ashby is being prosecuted at a time when police tactics are under review nationwide following the fatal shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri, and the chokehold death of an unarmed man in New York City. Grand juries declined to charge officers in those cases, but this week two Albuquerque police officers were charged with murder in the shooting death of a knife-wielding homeless man that led to violent protests.","The Colorado Bureau of Investigation found James Ashby aggressively pursued Jack Jacquez, 27, after stopping him Oct. 12 .

"The door is firmly shut to Bill Cosby's return to NBC, the network's top entertainment executive said Friday. 'That's safe to say,' NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt said Friday when asked if the network would ever again do a project with Cosby, who 30 years ago was the sitcom king with the network's 'The Cosby Show.' NBC's decision to sever ties with the 77-year-old comedian comes in the wake of multiple allegations of sexual assault against him, two lawsuits and a complaint to Los Angeles police earlier this week from a woman who says the comedian sexually abused her in 2008. NBC's top entertainment executive says the door is firmly shut to Bill Cosby's return to the network. In the wake of new and renewed allegations of sexual assault against Cosby . The network said late last year it was dropping plans to develop a 'classic' family sitcom with him. The series was announced in mid-2014, before a rising tide of accusations against Cosby by women who say he drugged and assaulted them. During a question and answer session with the Television Critics Association, Greenblatt was asked to explain what tipped the network against working with Cosby, who was publicly fending off allegations from two women a decade ago. Cosby has not been charged in any of the alleged assaults and has denied them. In 2005, he settled a civil suit filed by one woman that included claims of battery and assault. 'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of,' Greenblatt said. Although Cosby hasn't been proven guilty of anything, 'when that many people come out and have such similar complaints, it became a tainted situation' and the network didn't want to proceed with the sitcom. He's glad NBC 'is out from under that,' Greenblatt said. Pressed to say precisely what number of accusers is seen as critical mass, Greenblatt replied: 'Fifteen, yes, two no.' Cosby has faced more career fallout, including Netflix's decision to indefinitely postpone a comedy special and the cancellation of concerts in his ongoing tour. The network said late last year it was dropping plans to develop a 'classic' family sitcom with Cosby . Meanwhile, Donald Trump said Friday that no consideration was given to editing the opening episode of the current season of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" in light of the Cosby controversy. In that episode, filmed before the recent spate of allegations against Cosby became public, his former TV 'daughter' Keshia Knight Pulliam was eliminated from the competition by Trump because she refused to call Cosby for help with her charity. The timing of the episode, which aired in January, became awkward. 'We didn't want to make any changes,' said Trump, the show's star. 'We're very happy with it. It became a very, very big topic of conversation.' Cosby is planning to perform in Colorado this weekend despite expected protests and a new allegation of sexual misconduct which has launched a police probe. The comedian released a statement on Thursday thanking his 'courageous' fans and saying he's ready to perform in Pueblo on Friday and at Denver's Buell Theater on Saturday, his first gigs in the U.S. this year. He finished his statement with references to his 'Fat Albert' character's trademark line and to his 2013 television special: 'Hey, Hey, Hey - I'm Far From Finished.'","NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt said network was done with Cosby, who 30 years ago was the sitcom king with the network's 'The Cosby Show'

"Despite being crippled in space, Kepler has managed to discover a star that hosts three Earth-sized planets. The outermost planet orbits in the 'Goldilocks' zone - a region where surface temperatures could be moderate enough for liquid water and perhaps life to exist. At a distance of 150 light years, the star ranks among the top 10 nearest stars known to have transiting planets. Scroll down for video . After the Kepler Space Telescope lost two if its four reaction wheels, it was unable to point accurately enough for long observations. Despite being hobbled in space, Kepler has managed to discover a star that hosts three planets only slightly larger than Earth . The star, EPIC 201367065, is a cool red M-dwarf about half the size and mass of our own sun. Its distance means it's bright enough for astronomers to study the planets' atmospheres to determine whether they are like Earth's atmosphere and possibly conducive to life. 'A thin atmosphere made of nitrogen and oxygen has allowed life to thrive on Earth,' said Ian Crossfield, the University of Arizona astronomer who led the study. 'But nature is full of surprises. Many exoplanets discovered by the Kepler mission are enveloped by thick, hydrogen-rich atmospheres that are probably incompatible with life as we know it.' This cartoon shows the three newly discovered extrasolar planets (right) casting shadows on their host star that can been seen as eclipses, or transits, at Earth (left). Earth can be detected by the same effect, but only in the plane of Earth's orbit (the ecliptic) In their hunt for alien life, astronomers have so far focused on looking for Earth-like planets around smaller, cooler suns. But these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star. Now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars, and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day-night cycle similar to Earth – increasing the chance of finding alien life. 'Planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to Earth's than previously expected,' said Jérémy Leconte, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. 'If we are correct, there is no permanent, cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet,' he said. Though astronomers are still awaiting concrete evidence, theoretical arguments suggest that many exoplanets should be able to maintain an atmosphere as massive that of Earth. While their models show that they would have a day-night cycle making them more similar to Earth, the duration of their days could last between a few weeks and few months. The three planets are 2.1, 1.7 and 1.5 times the size of Earth. The outermost planet, at 1.5 Earth radii, is the smallest of the group and orbits far enough from its host star that it receives levels of light from its star similar to those received by Earth from the sun. 'Most planets we have found to date are scorched. This system is the closest star with lukewarm transiting planets,' Eric Petigura a UC Berkeley graduate student who made the discovery. 'There is a very real possibility that the outermost planet is rocky like Earth, which means this planet could have the right temperature to support liquid water oceans.' University of Hawaii astronomer Andrew Howard said that extrasolar planets are discovered by the hundreds these days, though many astronomers are left wondering if any of the newfound worlds are really like Earth. The newly discovered planetary system will help resolve this question, he said. 'We've learned in the past year that planets the size and temperature of Earth are common in our Milky Way galaxy,' Professor Howard said. 'We also discovered some Earth-size planets that appear to be made of the same materials as our Earth, mostly rock and iron.' The next step will be observations with other telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, to take the fingerprint of the molecules in the planetary atmospheres. If these warm, nearly Earth-size planets have puffy, hydrogen-rich atmospheres, Hubble will see the tell-tale signal. The Goldilocks zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet . The discovery is all the more remarkable, the researchers said said, because the Kepler telescope lost two reaction wheels that kept it pointing at a fixed spot in space. Kepler was reborn in 2014 as 'K2' with a clever strategy of pointing the telescope in the plane of Earth's orbit, the ecliptic, to stabilise the spacecraft. Kepler is now back to mining the cosmos for planets by searching for eclipses or 'transits,' as planets pass in front of their host stars and periodically block some of the starlight. 'This discovery proves that K2, despite being somewhat compromised, can still find exciting and scientifically compelling planets,' said Professor Petigura. Kepler sees only a small fraction of the planetary systems in its gaze: those with orbital planes aligned edge-on to our view from Earth. Planets with large orbital tilts are missed. A census of Kepler planets that the team conducted in 2013 corrected statistically for these random orbital orientations, and concluded that one in five sun-like stars in the Milky Way Galaxy have Earth-size planets in the habitable zone. Accounting for other types of stars as well, there may be 40 billion such planets galaxy-wide.

"If you’re running low on fuel beware of filling up on the M42 because it charges drivers the ‘consistently highest’ motorway petrol prices in Britain, an exclusive new seven month study revealed. Motorists on the M42 to the South and East of Birmingham in the West Midlands regularly face the most expensive unleaded costs, while those on the M61 in the North West of England face the highest prices for diesel. Details emerged in new investigation for the Daily Mail by fuel experts PetrolPrices.com who tracked fuel prices at 133 motorway filling stations in the period from June until the end of December just as prices nationally were beginning to plummet. Motorists on the M42  in the West Midlands regularly face the most expensive unleaded costs . It reveals that motorists forced to play the M-way lottery could be paying up to 18p more per litre of unleaded – or around £9 per fill-up - on these most expensive motorways than on the cheapest ones. For diesel the gap can widen to 20p adding £10 to a fill-up. But compared to the average prices for unleaded fuel across the UK, the difference can be up to 23p per litre – or £11.50 per fill up. Drivers routinely pay up to 10p a litre more on average than off the motorway in a practice that ministers have condemned as ‘a rip-off’. By contrast, the best-value motorway outlets are on the M65 in the North West of England and M8 in Scotland, where prices are often less than the national average for unleaded and diesel. The detailed investigation follows the Government’s announcement of plans to force motorway filling stations to display their prices – and those of subsequent outlets – on giant roadside poles so motorists can choose whether to fill-up now or drive on to a cheaper outlet. The PetrolPrices.com report does not name individual outlets, but highlights the costliest motorways as a whole. It notes: ‘Every motorway with a service station was included, and the maximum and minimum price of standard unleaded and standard diesel was recorded, along with the price difference for these fuels between the most and least expensive outlets on each motorway.’ Drivers on the M61 in the North West of England face the highest prices for diesel, the study found . The figures show that, of the 26 motorway-class roads with service stations, the most expensive average price for unleaded petrol was found on the M42 which snakes around Birmingham in the Midlands. It was the costliest in five of the seven months studied – with prices tracked at 142.4p per litre in June, 142.9p per litre in August, 146.9p in September, 134.9p in November and rising to 139.9p in December as prices nationally began to drop in line with falling oil prices. Ironically three nearby independent Harvest filling stations in the Birmingham and Worcestershire area were the first to smash the £1 barrier by selling unleaded at 99p a litre. The most expensive spots were charging 18p per litre more for unleaded and 20p for diesel . The M61, which runs between Manchester and Preston in the North West, was costliest for petrol in two of the months tracked - 142.9p in July and 142.9 in November. :: Diesel was also dearest on the same two motorways – the M61 in five months from June to October inclusive when the price was static at 151.9p, and the M42 in the two months of November at 139.9p and December at 141.9p. On Thursday the most expensive unleaded on the M42 cost 130.9p at a time when the average price cross the UK was 107.74p – a difference of 23.16p. The most expensive diesel on the M42 was 134.90 compared to a national average of 115.05p – a difference of 19.85p. :: At the other end of the scale, the cheapest average price for unleaded petrol in four of the months surveyed was on the M65 near Preston, Blackburn and Burnley, and for the other three months on the M8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh. The M65 was cheapest for unleaded in July (130.9p per litre), October (126.9p), November (123.9p) and December (119.9p) The M8 was cheapest for unleaded in June (129.9p), and in August and September (both 128.9p).

It concluded that overall the M65 and M8 motorways, as well as the M56 on Merseyside, were ‘consistently among the cheapest motorways’. The report said the biggest gap between the most expensive and cheapest petrol stretched to 18p in September – the difference between 146.9p on the expensive M42 and 128.9p on the cheaper M8. That can make the difference of £9 to fill up the average family car.

The report notes: ‘The fact that one of the dearest (M61) and cheapest (M65) motorways are linked suggests the location of a motorway is not the reason for price differences. And, of the least expensive motorways, one (M65) is in England while the other (M8) links Glasgow and Edinburgh.’ The best value motorway outlets were found on the M65 through Lancashire and the M8 in Scotland . The biggest price difference between the most and least expensive outlets on an individual motorway was 14p for unleaded on the M5. That was followed by 12p a litre for unleaded, found on both the A1(M) and M4 motorways. For diesel, the biggest difference between the most and least expensive outlets on an individual motorway was 13p per litre, also on the A1(M) and M4. The differences mean drivers could save £6.00 on a single tank of unleaded and £6.50 on a tank of diesel leading to savings of hundreds of pounds a year. Pete Zaborszky of PetrolPrices.com which tracks prices at more than 10,000 UK filling stations said: ‘There is clear evidence of motorway service stations exploiting the convenience factor for motorists. Most drivers fill up because they have to and may not realise there is cheaper fuel close by off the motorway. ‘What these figures show is that, even if you do buy your fuel on a motorway, you can save a small fortune simply by taking a few seconds to check where the best deals are. If you don’t seek out the best prices, you could be giving hundreds of pounds away needlessly every year.’ RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘It’s no wonder that motorists feel held to ransom with prices on the motorways inflated to such an extent. It is totally unacceptable.’ The Daily Mail photographed an Esso filling station on the M42 at Tamworth services selling unleaded at 130.9p a litre and diesel at 132.9p. Some 30 miles to the South West on the ame M42, the Hopwood Park service area at Alvechurch near Redditch was selling Shell unleaded at 118.9p, some 12p cheaper. Diesel there was retailing at 125.9p, some 7p cheaper. The average price across the UK, according to Experian Catalist was 107.46p for unleaded and 114.81 for diesel. Month . June . July . August .

It was selling diesel at 18.09 more than the average UK price, adding just over £9 to each fill up. The Department for Transport begins work early next year trialling a new fuel-comparison sign at five service stations on the M5 between Bristol and Exeter, with a view to introducing them nationally by the end of 2015.

"After six years of trying for a baby and two failed rounds of IVF, Ashley Moore thought she had run out of options. A further problem was that the 32-year-old has cystic fibrosis, which can make conception difficult. So she was astonished when, following a conversation after a family wedding, the sister-in-law she barely knew offered to become a surrogate for her and husband Alastair. Ashley Moore, left, was trying desperately to have a baby when her sister-in-law, who lived in the United States, Michelle, right, offered to act as a surrogate leading to the successful delivery of Emerson, centre . Ashley, second left, is married to Alastair, whose brother Dominic, right, suggested that his wife Michelle, second right, would be willing to carry their baby Emerson, as they already had Maddy, centre . Alastair Moore, left, and his wife Ashley, right, tried unsuccessfully for six years to have a baby, including IVF . Even then there were obstacles – her sister-in-law lived in Tennessee and so Ashley’s frozen embryos had to be sent across the Atlantic to the US. But all went well and Ashley and Alastair now have a healthy son, Emerson. Ashley said she was ‘beyond amazed’ when Michelle Moore, who is married to Alastair’s brother Dominic, offered surrogacy as a solution. ‘We had tried all we could and it wasn’t going to work out,’ Ashley said. ‘But for all the doors that closed a window had just opened and it just felt like it was meant to be. It was such a relief after so many years of hitting stumbling blocks. ‘I didn’t know Michelle that well. I wasn’t particularly close with her because we hadn’t spent much time together. We certainly weren’t close enough to expect such an amazing offer to be made. ‘Even then, you can’t help but think, “Can we deal with all the things we need to deal with to make this happen?” There are lots of costs and legal issues with a surrogacy.’ After getting approval from their doctors, they went ahead and Emerson was born in June. Ashley, who is originally from Texas and is a volunteer fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, met entrepreneur Alastair, 34, while attending a university summer school in London. The couple married in April 2005 and began trying for a baby late in 2006. After 18 months without success they were referred for fertility treatment, but Ashley struggled to complete courses of medication because of bouts of ill health. Eventually, in 2012, she received two rounds of NHS-funded IVF treatment, both of which failed because of what doctors suspected was a problem with her womb lining. The couple’s NHS funding had run out and they felt there were no more options open to them. They had met Michelle, 34, only a few times because she and Dominic, 30, lived in her native Tennessee with daughter Maddy, four. After doctors agreed to the plan, Ashley and Alastair, right, sent their embryos to the US to be implanted . Michelle and Dominic, right, with daughter Maddy, moved to London when Michelle fell pregnant so Ashley, second left, could attend all the pre-natal scans until Emerson was born in June last year weighing 7lb 13oz . Ashley, left, was unable to fall pregnant herself because she has cystic fibrosis, pictured with son Emerson . But when Ashley talked of her worries about conceiving to her following a family wedding in France in July 2012, she made a serious offer to be their surrogate. A year later, two rounds of frozen embryos were shipped to the US. The first, in August 2013, failed but the second, in October, was successful. Ashley said: ‘They held up the positive test on Skype and told us it was a yes. I took such a deep breath because of the shock I started coughing really badly. When you hear “no, no, no” for so long you don’t know how to handle it when it is finally a “yes”.’ Michelle and Dominic moved to London and Ashley attended all the scans and appointments. She said: ‘I cannot speak highly enough about Michelle and how she made me feel during the pregnancy. I did worry if I was going to be too jealous that it was her and not me that was pregnant, but she did the very best job that was possible to make it feel ours.’ Emerson was born by planned caesarean section weighing a healthy 7lb 13oz and was given Michelle’s maiden name Okon as a middle name in her honour. Ashley said: ‘There he finally was, after all the effort and the hard work and the waiting and the tears. I got the first cuddle, which was just amazing. ‘There’s nobody higher in my books than Michelle. What can you say about somebody who gives you the ultimate gift?’ Michelle said: ‘I could see how much she wanted her own child. It felt like the right thing to do. ‘[Dominic and I] wanted Maddy to have a playmate but, at the same time, we’d decided not to have any more children. So giving Maddy a cousin was the perfect solution.’ Alastair said: ‘It’s amazing being a dad, I love it, and we can’t thank Michelle enough.’ r.taylor@dailymail.co.uk .

"Fans of The Lego Movie have reacted angrily after the hit film was snubbed in the Oscar nominations announced yesterday morning. Some are branding the rejection 'a disgrace' while others have called it a 'travesty' after the movie, which was hugely popular with audiences, grossed more than £300million worldwide. The film's directors, who won the Best Animated Feature gong at yesterday's Critics' Choice Movie Awards in Hollywood, tweeted their mixed emotions to being overlooked by the Academy before receiving hundreds of supportive messages. Snubbed: Lego Movie directors Christopher Miller (L) and Philip Lord (R) accept the Best Animated Feature gong at yesterday's Critics' Choice Movie Awards in Hollywood, alongside producer Dan Lin.  But their film was overlooked by the Oscars . Philip Lord posted a picture of an Oscar statuette made out of Lego with the caption 'it's okay, made my own!' - in response to a wave of tweets from fans angered by the film being snubbed by the Academy. He also posted: 'This is not a tragedy. Congrats to incredible crew and cast of The Lego Movie, who made a classic.' But his co-director, Chris Miller, had earlier tweeted: 'Congrats to 'Everything is Awesome' though currently the title of the song doesn't seem especially accurate!' Mr Miller was referring to the Lego Movie's soundtrack 'Everything is Awesome' - which did receive an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song at the 87th Academy Awards on February 22. Response: Director Philip Lord posted a picture of an Oscar statuette made out of Lego with the caption 'it's okay, made my own!' in response to a wave of messages from fans angry that the film was snubbed . He added: 'Thanks all for the outpouring of love for the LEGO Movie today. We didn't make it for awards, we made it to be a trending topic on Twitter.' The Lego Movie was surprisingly overlooked in the category for Best Animated Feature at the 2015 Oscars. Here are the films that were nominated: . 1. Big Hero 6 . 2. The Boxtrolls . 3. How to Train Your Dragon 2 . 4. Song of the Sea . 5. The Tale of Princess Kaguya . The movie was the first produced by Warner Animation Group and is an international co-production of the United States, Australia, and Denmark. Based on the Lego construction toys, the film tells the story of Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego figure prophesied to save the universe from the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) as he gains different allies along the way. Following the Academy's shock announcement, angry fans immediately flooded Twitter with messages of support for the Lego Movie, which was the highest-grossing film of 2014 in the UK. One user, @Ragnarok12, wrote: 'No #Oscars2015 nomination for the lego movie??? Are you kidding me? How much did Disney pay the Academy?!' Another user, John McCready, posted: 'Just seen the Lego movie wasn't nominated for the Oscars #disgrace.' Bittersweet: Co-director Chris Miller posted a message congratulating the producers of the film's soundtrack 'Everything Is Awesome' after it was nominated for Best Original Song, but was clearly surprised by the movie being overlooked in the Best Animated Feature category . Huge hit: The Lego Movie took more than £300million worldwide and was the highest grossing film in the UK in 2014 . And @RuckingGray wrote: 'Did the makers of #LegoMovie do something to p*** off the Oscar panel? Absolute travesty, earned best animated pic.' The snub means the film's Australian animators, Animal Logic, will go unrecognised. The 2007 Oscar winners for Happy Feet are known for their work on Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, X-Men: Days of Future Past and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. 1. The Lego Movie: £34.27m . 2. The Inbetweeners 2: £33.33m . 3. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: £32.63m . 4. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1:  £29.46m . 5.

Meanwhile, Philip Lord and Chris Miller, who also directed 21 Jump Street and 22 Jump Street, are currently writing the script for a The Lego Movie sequel - while a Lego Batman film also in the works. The Lego Movie topped UK box office rankings in 2014, making £34.27 million in ticket sales. It beat runner-up The Inbetweeners 2 by more than £1 million in takings - while Dawn of the Planet of the Apes came third, grossing £32.63 million. Films that made the cut for Best Animated Feature at next month's ceremony included Big Hero 6, How To Train Your Dragon 2, The Boxtrolls, Song of the Sea and The Tale of Princess Kaguya. Little-known Song of the Sea was the big surprise in the category. Produced by Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon, the movie is based around the ancient Celtic legend of the selkie - a mythological creature which takes the form of a beautiful woman on land and a seal when in the sea.

"A southern California couple were forced to make urgent changes to their wedding plans after the groom was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Nicholas Brzuska and Destiny Hernandez had been engaged for two years when just three weeks before their wedding day, doctors discovered a four-ounce tumor inside Nicholas’ brain that required immediate surgery. The couple had chosen to wed on January 4, 2015, to celebrate the anniversary of the date that Nicholas had first said he loved Destiny, but doctors feared he would not be strong enough by then. Three weeks before their wedding, Nicholas and Destiny Brzuska discovered that he would require urgent surgery for a brain tumor. Not wanting to wait they decided to get married that night (pictured) Having rallied friends and family together on the day of his diagnosis, they got married at a 24-hour chapel near where they live, and Nicholas' operation was scheduled for January 6, two days after they were meant to marry . Their original venue, the Garden Room in Garden Grove, California, will not let them reschedule their wedding plans nor give them a refund . They rallied friends and family, found a 24-hour chapel in Long Beach and got married that same night, December 13, 2014. Destiny contacted the original wedding venue, The Garden Room in Garden Grove, California, and still wanting their dream wedding, explained the situation and asked if they could push back the date. Destiny told ABC7 Eyewitness News that there is nothing in the contract that prohibits the couple from pushing the date back, but a manager at the venue denied her request and said that the $3,600 deposit was non-refundable. The owner of the venue, Lisa Waddell, told Eyewitness News she had no comment on the matter. ‘I was in tears, like how can you do this, and still the owner has not called,’ Destiny said. Doctors successfully removed the tumor from Nicholas' brain on January 6, 2015, and he is now in recovery. He is still blown away by the lack of sympathy for their situation: ‘[It's] disconcerting knowing that there's people like that out there. All they are [is] money-hungry,’ he said. With their dream wedding ceremony planned for December 13, 2015, to mark their one year wedding anniversary, they couple are still looking for a new venue. On her Facebook page Destiny posted: ‘We want to Thank everyone for all the support! We really appreciate it!’ ‘[It's] disconcerting knowing that there's people like that out there. All they are [is] money-hungry' Nicholas said, though the couple have now decided to go ahead with the wedding of their dreams later this year .","Three weeks before their wedding, Nicholas and Destiny Brzuska discovered that Nicholas would require urgent surgery for a brain tumor .

"The Duchess of York has once again publicly stood by her ex-husband after appearing on The Rachael Ray Cooking show today. Sarah Ferguson, 55, appeared on American television and said that despite the fact that 'recent weeks have been pretty bad for the York family', they remain a 'unit'. Her interview comes days after the Duchess appeared on the Today show and defended Prince Andrew following recent allegations. Scroll down for video . The Prince's ex-wife slammed reports that he had sexual relations with an underage girl as 'salacious lies' and defended him as a 'humongously good man'. In a passionate rebuttal on the show on Tuesday, the Duchess said that she was standing by 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever' amid the allegations. Buckingham Palace has issued a statement strongly denying the allegations against Prince Andrew which Sarah repeated during her interview. She said the claims against her former husband - whom she called 'a great father and humongously good man' - were 'shockingly accusatory allegations which I don't think are right'. And speaking with Rachel Ray and her guest host, singer Donny Osmond, Sarah once again stressed the family's solidarity at this difficult time. In the promotional clip of the taped interview, the Duchess is seen coming out from backstage in a tight fitting blue dress, pointing at the hosts enthusiastically and running over towards them. In the promotional clip of the taped interview, the Duchess is seen coming out from backstage in a tight fitting blue dress, pointing at the hosts enthusiastically and running over towards them . She spoke with Rachel Ray and her guest host, singer Donny Osmond, on American TV . Once sat down at the table, the trio begin discussing Sarah's family life. The Duchess of York said 24-year-old daughter Eugenie still sits on her lap, and thinks Donny Osmond is 'very cool'. 'I did actually try to sing Puppy Love,' she says. 'We call ourselves the tripod. Mummy, Beatrice and Eugenie. We're best friends, and then sometimes I'm mummy,' she continues. The Duchess of York said 24-year-old daughter Eugenie still sits on her lap . 'I'm very proud of my girls, they're extraordinarily courageous. 'They have their dad, whose a member of the royal family, then they have their bonkers mum. They have to balance. 'I think its really good that they're confident. I've always told them, ""No-one wants to see a bad tempered princess, so if you go out in the sidewalk - smile. No matter what, smile. If you don't want to go out, don't go out."" 'I think the recent weeks have been pretty bad for the York family but we remain a unit as we always do. 'I'm very proud of the way the girls carry on. They just carry on. 'I think Beatrice and Eugenie are the best ambassadors to good parenting. 'Andrew and I are the happiest divorced  couple in the world. Extraordianry, isn't it? We live in the same house. But then its a big house.' The pair, who divorced in 1996 after 10 years of marriage, remain good friends, she said. They have two daughters together, Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie. Sarah said she is very proud of the way her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie 'just carry on' She says her girls are the best ambassadors to good parenting . Prince Andrew has come under fire over his past friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with an underage girl. Virginia Roberts - now said to be a married mother-of-three in her 30s - alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. Others named in the lawsuit have also denied the claims. Attorney and former Harvard Law school professor Alan Dershowitz said the accusations were 'totally false and made up'. The accusation, which is contained in a motion filed in Florida, is part of a lawsuit over how federal prosecutors handled Epstein's case. He was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution. Two years after his 2009 release, Epstein was pictured in New York City with the prince, and their friendship was a source of controversy. Buckingham Palace has issued a statement strongly denying the allegations, which the Duchess of York says are 'false and without any foundation'.

"A teenager  fighting for Islamic State in Syria bragged about passing through Belgian airport security  'like a knife through butter' a week before last night's terror raids which killed two. A fighter by the name of Abu Mariya Belgiki branded the Belgian security service 'probably the dumbest in the world' last Friday, in the midst of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, after he was waved through security at Brussels airport. Later the same day he posted again, praising the Paris attackers, before asking: 'What are the brothers in Belgium waiting for?' Last night armed Belgian police killed two suspected jihadis and arrested a third after a shoot-out in the eastern city of Verviers, with offices saying they had prevented 'a second Paris'. Scroll down for video . A Belgian teen calling himself Abu Mariya Belgiki (pictured), who has been fighting for Islamic State, mocked the Belgian security services a week before yesterday's shoot-out between jihadis and police . Six days before Belgian security forces killed two jihadis and arrested a third, and in the midst of the Paris terror attacks, Abu Mariya posted this taunting message about passing through Brussels airport security . Investigators believe the men, who were armed with machine guns and pistols, were part of a cell planning to attack police 'on a grand scale'. But just six days previously, while the Kouachi brothers were still on the run in France having shot 12 people dead, Abu Mariya made his chilling boast. In tweets supplied to Mail Online by research group MEMRI, he said: 'Don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but Belgian intelligence agency is the laziest and the dumbest in the world probably… . 'They kept me under surveillance since I was 14. And I passed through Brussels airport like a knife cutting through soft butter…' Later the same day he took to Twitter once more, this time writing about the moment his ISIS superior told him about the Paris terror attacks. He wrote: 'Was going to bed yesterday, my ameer [leader] yells and says, ""France, France, you know France?"" I said yes its south of Belgium. He said ""Yes I know."" 'He said 'Ikhwa [brothers] did operation there and killed 12'. I was like whooaaaaa what are the ikhwa in Belgium waiting for…: )' Armed police carrying out a terror raid in a flat above a bakery in Verviers got into a shoot-out with suspected jihadi fighters yesterday, saying they were armed with military weapons and handguns . The Belgian state prosecutor said the men were thought to be part of a cell preparing to carry out 'large scale attacks' against police and security forces . It is not known whether Abu Mariya was one of those who engaged police in a bloody firefight late yesterday evening. Abu Mariya Belgiki is not believed to be his real name, but rather an Arabic nom de guerre he took on after going to fight. Belgiki means Belgium in Arabic. In one post from Syria, he included an image of himself wearing a scruffy leather jacket and jeans, while sitting cross-legged on the ground with a short-stock AK 47 rifle resting in his lap. A message under the image read: 'From a life under oppression to hayat [life] under the raya [flag] of tawheed [oneness, referring to the black and white ISIS flag]' On the same day Abu Mariya tweeted about Brussels airport, he also posted this chilling message praising the Paris attackers, and asking: 'What are the ikhwa [brothers] in Belgium waiting for?' He also speaks about his life fighting for ISIS, complaining about coalition airstrikes and bragging about getting hold of American automatic rifles. In one post on January 5, just days before his apparent return to Belgium, he wrote: 'Making Wudu [prayer], jets …hanging clothes in the sun, jets… playing with cats in the garden, jets... urghhh.' In another tweet on the same day he added: 'So funny reading US PROPERTY on our m16's.' He also spoke about life in Islamic State's so-called Caliphate, discussing a hierarchy among fighters, with those from the Arabian Peninsula and Jordan being given the most rights. Posting in Flemish he also recounted meeting a 16-year-old Dutch boy in the street, and said English is a commonly used language among the jihadis. In a final note on January 9, shortly before his account was taken offline, he seems to suggest that ISIS are planning an attack in Egypt. The badly-spelled message said: 'Soon u will here wonderful news from the land of Egypt... we are coming to shake the throne of Sisi.' The throne of Sisi is though to refer to the current Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Forensic officers inspect the doorway to an apartment in Verviers where it is thought police were attacked by jihadis during raids last night. In total twelve people were arrested . Last night's shootings in Belgium occurred as the country's military  carried out raids on a dozen homes across the country, including one above a bakery, which may have triggered the gun battle. Two suspected jihadis were killed in the firefight. A third man, said to be seriously wounded, was last night in police custody, along with six other suspects. Officials last night said Belgium had raised the threat of terror attacks to its highest level. Federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt confirmed that an active terror cell had been about to launch ‘attacks on a grand scale’. He added: ‘The suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralised.’ The shooting took place near a railway station in the town of Verviers, near Belgium’s eastern border with Germany. A resident told Belgian TV: ‘I heard two explosions and saw two young men run away. They were between 25 and 30 years, [and] of Arab origin.’ Around 300 jihadi fighters have left Belgium, which has a large Muslim population, to fight for ISIS in Iraq and Syria. This is the largest proportion of any country in the EU, with the exception of the UK, according to news service Radio Free Liberty Radio Europe.","Fighter calling himself Abu Mariya Belgiki posted in midst of Paris attack .

"The first atomic bomb test in July 16, 1945 marks the beginning of the Anthropocene – a new chapter of the Earth’s geological history, an international group of scientists has proposed. They say that humans are having such a marked impact on the Earth that we are changing its geology, to create distinctive new layers of rock and soil. The use of nuclear weapons, and their nuclear fallout, has left an indelible mark, combined with a ‘great acceleration’ of other human activity. Scroll down for video . The first atomic bomb test in July 16, 1945 marks the beginning of the Anthropocene – a new chapter of the Earth’s geological history, an international group of scientists has proposed. A photo of a giant column of smoke rising over Nagasaki, Japan, where the second atomic bomb was dropped, is shown . The new geological epoch - the name of which means the human epoch - was proposed by Nobel Prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen just 15 years ago, and since then the idea has caught on. However, the precise date it began is being debated by experts. Jan Zalasiewicz a geology professor at the University of Leicester, said: ‘Like any geological boundary, it is not a perfect marker – levels of global radiation really rose in the early 1950s, as salvoes of bomb tests took place. ‘But it may be the optimal way to resolve the multiple lines of evidence on human-driven planetary change. Time - and much more discussion - will tell.’ Experts have debated when the Anthropocene should begin, because humans have been affecting the environment for thousands of years – during the Industrial Revolution in 18th century England, for example. The new geological epoch (shown at the bottom of this diagram) - the name of which means the human epoch - was proposed by Nobel Prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen just 15 years ago, and since then the idea has caught on . The first atomic bomb test took place on July 16, 1945 at the US Army’s test range in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Scientists say that that first blast marks the beginning of a new geological epoch – the Anthropocene. While other dates are being discussed, a working group claims this historical landmark is appropriate because nuclear tests and weapons have left an indelible mark on the Earth by changing its geology. A ‘great acceleration’ of population, carbon emissions, species invasions and extinctions and the production of concrete, plastics and metals in vast quantities, since that date, also makes it appropriate. But members of the working group have suggested the turning point happened in the mid-twentieth century. This was when humans did not just leave traces of their actions, but began to alter the whole Earth system. There was a ‘great acceleration’ of population, of carbon emissions, of species invasions and extinctions, of earth moving, of the production of concrete, plastics and metals, they said. It included the start, too, of the nuclear age, when artificial radionuclides were scattered across the Earth,to leave a detectable signal in modern strata virtually everywhere on the planet. Dr Zalasiewicz, who chairs the Anthropocene working group set up by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, said the Anthropocene could be considered to be drawn at the moment of detonation of the world’s first nuclear test. The proposal has been signed by 26 members of the group, created by the body that oversees changes to the geological timeline. The beginning of the nuclear age marks the historic turning point when humans first accessed an enormous new energy source - and is also a time level that can be effectively tracked within geological strata – layers of rocks and soil. The start of the nuclear age, which coincides with the beginning of widely used and thrown away plastic objects (illustrated with a stock image), can be effectively tracked within geological strata – layers of rocks and soil, the experts said . The date at which the Anthropocene started is the subject of debate. A total of 26 members of a working party that have backed it to begin at the start of atominc testing, but the beginning of the Industrial revolution was mulled too. An image of the first iron bridge, built by Victorian engineers is shown . Previous ‘divisions’ between geological eras have been marked by 'spikes' in the geological records, caused by global catastrophes such as the asteroid strike thought to be responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs, or a wave of volcanic eruptions. Dr Zalasiewicz said: ‘Like any geological boundary, it is not a perfect marker – levels of global radiation really rose in the early 1950s, as salvoes of bomb tests took place. ‘But it may be the optimal way to resolve the multiple lines of evidence on human-driven planetary change. Time - and much more discussion - will tell.’ This year, the Anthropocene Working Group will put together more evidence on the new geological epoch, including discussion of possible alternative time boundaries. In 2016, the group aims to make recommendations on whether this new time unit should be formalised and, if so, how it might be defined and characterised. After the testing of atomic weapons began, there was a ‘great acceleration’ of population, of carbon emissions, of species invasions and extinctions, of earth moving, of the production of concrete, plastics and metals, the experts said.

"John Craven is one of the oldest presenters on the BBC and is best known for more factual programming such as Countryfile, which he has presented since 1989. The 74-year-old was recently given a new TV show . For John Craven, being given a new show at the age of 74 is certainly a great achievement. But for his former Countryfile colleague Miriam O’Reilly, the news comes tinged with irony. Craven was the main presenter when Miss O’Reilly, 57, was sacked from Countryfile in 2009 – a decision for which she successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination. She has since repeatedly accused the BBC of bias against older women, and says the decision to give Craven his own quiz show, Beat The Brain, makes her ‘laugh out loud’ because the BBC ‘still doesn’t get it’. Yesterday’s announcement of Craven’s new role came a day after a damning report accused the BBC of not giving enough opportunities to older women. Lord Best, who chaired the House of Lords investigation into women in current affairs broadcasting, claimed female presenters ‘become invisible’ after the age of 50. But Miss O’Reilly said Craven’s latest appointment proves that the problem stretches beyond news and current affairs. She said: ‘I am very fond of John and I’m delighted for him but I would also say I’m looking forward to the day when I see a woman of his age, with white hair, with his little paunch and his wrinkles being given the same opportunity. 'Some people will say you’ve got Anne Robinson who did The Weakest Link but she is stretched beyond recognition, she’s a size eight. ‘She might want to do that but a lot of women feel that is what they have to do to keep working.’ For John Craven (right), being given a new show is certainly a great achievement. But for his former Countryfile colleague Miriam O’Reilly (left), the news comes tinged with irony. Miss O’Reilly, 57, was sacked from Countryfile in 2009 – a decision for which she successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination . Miss O'Reilly was dropped from Countryfile before it was relaunched with younger presenters, which included Matt Baker (left), Julia Bradbury (centre) and veteran broadcaster Craven (right) She added: ‘That’s the problem that we have, men are allowed to age and women are not. You have to laugh, otherwise you’ll go mad.’ Craven is one of the oldest presenters on the BBC – although still lags behind Sir David Attenborough, 88, and David Dimbleby, 76. He is best known for more factual programming such as Countryfile, which he has presented since 1989, and Newsround, for 17 years prior to that. A spokesman for the BBC pointed to Angela Rippon, 70, who presents Rip Off Britain, The Great British Bake Off’s Mary Berry, 79, and Petula Clark, 82, as older women who host shows for the corporation. Miss Clark has been commissioned for a new show, Chanson: The Story Of French Music, which will be broadcast on BBC4 later this year. Miss O’Reilly was sacked from Countryfile when it moved to Sunday evenings on BBC1 in 2009, and went on to successfully sue the BBC for age discrimination. The programme relaunched with younger presenters Julia Bradbury and Matt Baker, along with veteran broadcaster Craven. At the time Craven told Radio Times he was ‘incredibly lucky’ to have survived 12 different producers.","Announcement of Craven's show came a day after report accused BBC of not giving enough opportunities to older women .

"US President Barack Obama today handed David Cameron an extraordinary pre-election endorsement, hailing the British Prime Minister as a 'great friend'. With less than four months until voters go to the polls in the tightest UK election for years, Mr Obama used a press conference in the White House to give the strongest possible backing to a fellow world leader. But behind the smiles there remains sharp differences over Mr Cameron's call for US web firms to do more to open up encrypted messages to security services in the wake of the atrocities in Paris last week. US President Barack Obama today handed David Cameron an extraordinary pre-election endorsement, hailing the British Prime Minister as a 'great friend' The glowing tribute came during a press conference in the White House after a two-day visit to Washington . President Barack Obama, right, gives David Cameron a pat on the back as they depart a joint news conference following their meeting at the White House in Washington today . Mr Cameron, who has been in Washington for a high profile visit ahead of the general election, shakes the President's hand . Images of Mr Cameron with the US President, who is more popular in the UK than in America, will be seen as a huge boost to Tory hopes . Mr Cameron has been in Washington for a high profile visit just months before the British general election. The two men dined together in the White House last night, on mushrooms, lamb and warm pear cake. Images of Mr Cameron with the US President, who is more popular in the UK than in America, will be seen as a huge boost to Tory hopes of contrasting Mr Cameron with Labour's Ed Miliband to be PM. But the highly unusual personal support from a Democrat President will delight Tory strategists and cause dismay for Labour, who hoped a visit to Washington last year had bolstered his image as a potential statesman. Mr Cameron revealed in an interview this month that Mr Obama often calls him 'bro' when they meet. 'Yes, he sometimes calls me 'Bro',' the PM said. The US President today said commentators had got into a 'tizzy' about he meant meant by it and sparked a debate about even the definition and origin of the word 'bro'. Seeking to clear up the confusion, Mr Obama said: 'Put simply, David is a great friend. He is one of my closet and most trusted partners in the world. On many of the most pressing challenges that we face we see the world the same way. 'Great Britain is our indispensable partner, and David has been personally an outstanding partner - and I thank you for your friendship.' In response, Mr Cameron told the President: 'You are a great friend to Britain, and me personally.' However, as the press conference progressed it became clear that differences remain over the extent to which security agencies should be able to snoop on encrypted messages and social media like WhatsApp, SnapChat and Facebook. David Cameron and Barack Obama held talks in the Oval Office in the White House on the second day of the British Prime Minister's visit to Washington . The meeting was dominated by discussions on tackling terrorism and the threat of cyber attacks . Images of Mr Cameron with the US President, who is more popular in the UK than in America, will be seen as a huge boost to Tory re-election hopes . Mr Cameron insists the security agencies must be able to intercept communications between extremists and terror suspects who use encrypted messaging services and social media sites to plot atrocities. But the White House has been cool on the idea, arguing a 'balance' must be struck between privacy and national security. The comments came after the two men met in the Oval office for discussions on 'keeping people safe from security threats around the world'. As police stepped up protection for their own officers and patrols were mounted in Jewish areas, Mr Cameron called for US internet firms like Facebook to do more to catch and report extremists plotting atrocities. Scotland Yard announced it was taking action after given 'the deliberate targeting of the police' in recent attacks, including in Paris last week. There will also be increased patrols in Jewish communities in addition to existing security measures. But speaking ahead of talks with Mr Obama, the Prime Minister warned: 'There's no way you can give 100 percent protection in a free and open society. 'I would stress that while we have incredibly capable intelligence and security services, while we have very strong counter terrorism police there's an enormous role for the public as well.' On the general threat level, the Prime Minister added: 'It has been at severe for some time, so people should continue to go about their daily lives. One of the ways we defeat terrorism is to demonstrate that our way of life, our values, are incredibly robust.' The British Prime Minister and US President have tried to present a united front in Washington, unveiling joint cyber-security plans and a commitment to securing long-term economic growth . Labour leader Ed Miliband had hoped that a visit to the White House last year, and a meeting with President Obama, would help to prevent a ringing endorsement for Mr Cameron ahead of the election . Earlier they agreed an unprecedented level of co-operation, with a team of agents to help safeguard both countries. Britain and the US are to set up a joint 'cyber squad' to carry out fake hacking attacks on banks, aircraft and nuclear power plants. A report from British spy chiefs today warned four in every five big firms in the UK last year experienced some sort of serious cyber security breach. The PM warned cyber-hackers pose a 'real threat' to the City of London and revealed one attack cost a firm over £800million. He stressed there was 'need for a panic' because Britain was in a very strong position, and working closely with the US. Ahead of the meeting in the Oval Office, Mr Cameron said: 'Just as we have worked with our closest ally, the US, to protect our people and our countries from traditional threats, so we must work together to defend ourselves from new threats like cyber-attacks.' In the wake of North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures, UK and US security services will now establish a joint team of agents to confront the issue and respond to attacks. Agents at GCHQ and MI5 will work with their US counterparts to encourage information about threats to be shared at a greater pace. They will also conduct a series of 'war games' to test the resilience of both the UK and US in the face of cyber attacks. The first exercise will simulate an attack on the financial sector, for example on banks in the City and Wall Street, and will take place later this year. This will be followed by further 'war games' to test critical national infrastructure – likely to include air traffic control, power stations and healthcare systems. Barack Obama and David Cameron agreed to a joint effort to fight domestic terrorism after last week's deadly attacks in France .","Obama hails Cameron as a 'great friend' after talks in the Oval Office .

"Cllr Claudia Webbe, executive member for transport and environment said she hopes the surcharge will give residents an incentive to change vehicles . A council has come under fire for announcing controversial plans to force more than 9,000 diesel car drivers to pay an extra £100 every year to park outside their homes - in an attempt to cut air pollution. The north London council approved the 'diesel tax' in an effort to make the borough free of the polluters and reduce deadly emissions at a Thursday night meeting. Islington Council hope the introduction in April of an extra £8-a-month charge for parking permits for diesel cars will lead to drivers ditching their diesels and swapping them for 'greener' petrol engines. Council chiefs say that high levels of air pollution in their borough is a contributing factor in 74 per cent of deaths in the borough, with its most deprived areas being hardest hit. But taxi drivers, plumbers, builders, and anyone who uses their vehicle in their business will be exempt from paying the tax. Borough bosses hope to be ahead of the game in hitting targets for London Mayor Boris Johnson's Ultra Low Emission Zone. The scheme, which will be introduced in 2020, aims to increase air quality in the capital. Labour Councillor Claudia Webbe, Islington's executive member for transport and environment, said: 'Hopefully this surcharge will give residents an incentive to change their vehicles. 'Pollutants in diesel exhausts have been linked to heart and lung diseases, which are major causes of serious and long-term health issues and even death in Islington, and the surcharge will encourage a move away from diesel.' Diesel vehicles can emit up to four times more nitrogen oxides and 20 times more sooty particles than petrol vehicles. Islington Council has come under fire for announcing controversial plans to force more than 9,000 diesel car (like this one, pictured) owners to pay an extra £100 every year  in an attempt to cut air pollution . One diesel driver from Islingon, who asked not to be named, said: 'This is absolutely ridiculous - I already have to pay a fortune in road tax, car insurance and for a parking permit. 'I bought a diesel because the running costs are lower but now they're trying to make me pay more?' For more than a decade drivers buying diesel cars have enjoyed tax breaks because the cars were marketed as a greener option, producing lower levels of carbon dioxide and being more fuel efficient. But an on-going debate in both Europe and London about pollution levels is starting to shift the general mood against diesel power.

"Cancer patients who receive several weeks of radiation treatment could soon be a thing of the past, with doctors developing an Australian-first single session therapy in a handful of minutes. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne has trialled a powerful new technique that could enable patients to safely receive their radiation treatment in a single, ten-minute session. Radiation Oncologist Dr Shankar Siva said since 2010, patients at the centre have been treated with high-dose Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation Therapy (SABR) over a six to eight week period. But a team of experts have used a combination of the complex modelling calculations to allow doctors to deliver higher dosages and reduce treatment time even further. Scroll down for video . Cancer patients who receive several weeks of radiation treatment could soon be a thing of the past . By removing the laser's filter, the new flattening filter-free SABR treatment will enable doctors to control the peak power of the radiation beam. 'Our medical physicists have now introduced an innovative method to predict the stereotactic beam to deliver to a tumour a 'knock-out punch' of up to 28 Gray of radiation in a single session over only a handful of minutes,' Dr Siva said. 'This shift is particularly important for our older patients who cannot lie still for prolonged periods and for others who are in discomfort due to their disease.' Cancer patient Harold Sciberras ,80, was the first in Victoria to undergo the treatment on Friday . Dr Shankar Siva (right) with Clinical Research Physicist Associate Professor Annette Haworth in Victoria . The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne has trialled a powerful new technique that could enable patients to safely receive their radiation treatment in a single, ten-minute session . SABR is used to treat small secondary tumours that have spread short distances from the primary tumour, or inoperable primary cancers in highly sensitive locations such as the lung, and is typically delivered over three to five treatment sessions of 40–60 minutes each. Cancer patient Harold Sciberras was the first  in Victoria to undergo the treatment on Friday with a small primary lung cancer in his right lung irradiated. The 80-year-old was wrapped in a vacuum-sealed plastic slip while a 4D CT scanner tracked the tumour's position, enabling treatment to be delivered with greater accuracy and fewer side-effects. 'The location of the tumour makes it very difficult to operate or target with conventional radiation without affecting my healthy lung tissue, so this new technique has certainly come at the right time for me, and many others in my situation,' Sciberras said. Dr Siva said SABR has been a game changer for people with difficult to treat tumours . Patient Harold Sciberras said the new technique has certainly come at the right time for him and many others . 'The best news is I will be back at home in Diggers Rest tonight, and I will only need to return to Peter Mac for follow-up appointments.' Dr Siva added that SABR has been a game changer for people with difficult to treat tumours. 'The sharp delineation of the stereotactic beam greatly reduces damage to healthy tissue and allows for a higher dose through faster, more targeted delivery of radiation therapy and now, thanks to the work of our team, we can deliver this in one controlled blow for some of our patients,' Dr Siva said.","The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne trialled the innovative method for the first time on Friday .

"Bill Cosby is planning to perform in Colorado this weekend despite expected protests and a new allegation of sexual misconduct which has launched a police probe. The comedian released a statement on Thursday thanking his 'courageous' fans and saying he's ready to perform in Pueblo on Friday and at Denver's Buell Theater on Saturday, his first gigs in the U.S. this year. He finished his statement with references to his 'Fat Albert' character's trademark line and to his 2013 television special: 'Hey, Hey, Hey - I'm Far From Finished.' Scroll down for video . Bill Cosby performs  in Melbourne, Florida on November 21 last year. It was one of the few tour dates that was honored amid dozens of cancellations by venues and fans following sexual assault allegations that have emerged against the TV star . The 77-year-old comedian is facing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his lawyer and has never been charged. In the most recent allegation, a model claims Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008. Chloe Goins met with Los Angeles police on Wednesday to pursue criminal charges against the comedian over the incident almost seven years ago. Bill Cosby released this statement to The Denver Post: 'Dear Fans: I have thousands of loyal, patient and courageous fans that are going to leave their homes to enjoy an evening of laughter and return home feeling wonderful. 'I'm ready!... I thank you, the theatre staff, the event organizers and the Colorado Community for your continued support and coming to experience family, fun entertainment.... 'Hey, Hey, Hey - I'm Far From Finished.' An attorney for Miss Goins said after the meeting that his client is the first woman accusing Cosby of sexual misconduct whose case may fall within the statute of limitations. More than 15 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, including several who say the comedian drugged and raped them in incidents dating back at least four decades. Goins did not speak during a press conference Wednesday. Her attorney, Spencer Kuvin, said she came forward after hearing about other women describing abuse by Cosby and realizing she might have a valid criminal case. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, did not immediately return requests for comment this week. Mr Kuvin declined to discuss what Miss Goins told detectives but restated her allegations that Cosby drugged her at a 2008 event at the Playboy Mansion. The model does not know what happened while she was blacked out but Mr Kuvin says she awoke to find herself naked and Cosby over her. 'Ms. Goins and I are here for two reasons: for justice and accountability,' Kuvin said. Miss Goins is at least the second woman to meet with Los Angeles police detectives to recount accusations against Cosby. Chloe Goins, a model who claims Bill Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008, pictured outside LAPD headquarters after meeting investigators on Wednesday . Prosecutors rejected filing charges against Cosby based on allegations by Judy Huth, a Riverside County resident who is suing the comedian, alleging he abused her in the early 1970s when she was 15 years old. Huth's lawsuit states the abuse happened at the Playboy Mansion. Los Angeles police Commander Andrew Smith said that he could not confirm any investigation into Cosby and that sex abuse cases are 'extremely confidential'. Neither Smith nor Kuvin would speculate on what charges Cosby might face, and both noted that the statute of limitations for sex offenses are complex and depend on the facts of a case. Cosby's attorney has denied some of the accusations against the comedian, saying they have been discredited or come from discredited accusers. Cosby joked about the allegations against him at a recent show in Canada. 'We hope that the people that are paying to attend Mr. Cosby's shows understand that these victimized women have broken their silence now and they will not remain quiet any longer,' Kuvin said. 'Mr. Cosby should, and will be held accountable for what he's done.' He said women reporting abuse 'should be encouraged and not joked about'.","The comedian thanked his 'courageous' fans and said he's ready to perform in Pueblo on Friday and at Denver's Buell Theater on Saturday .

"Pictures of the victims of Wednesday's prison bus crash in Texas have been released. The bus skidded off an icy highway near Penwell, Texas, slid down an embankment and collided with a passing freight train, killing eight inmates and two corrections officers, including the bus driver. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice confirmed the 10 deaths in a statement, adding that four prisoners and one corrections officer were also injured. Scroll down for video . Top row, from left, correctional officers Christopher Davis, Eligio Garcia and Jason Self, and inmates, Jesus Reyna and Jeremiah Rodriguez; middle row, from left, inmates Adolfo Ruiz, Michael Stewart, Tyler Townsend, Angel Vasquez and Byron Wilson; bottom row, from left, inmates Kaleb Wise, Terry Johnson, Damien Rodriguez, Hector Rivera and Remigio Pineda. The surviving corrections officer, Jason Self, was in critical condition at a hospital in Lubbock. Inmates Johnson, Damien Rodriguez and Rivera were in critical condition in Odessa, while Pineda was in serious condition. A prison system statement identified the dead as correctional officers Christopher Davis, 53, and Eligio Garcia, 45; and inmates Byron Wilson, 34; Tyler Townsend, 29; Jesus Reyna, 44; Kaleb Wise, 22; Adolfo Ruiz, 32; Michael Sewart, 25; Angel Vasquez, 31; and Jeremiah Rodriguez, 35. The statement did not say which officer was driving the bus. Davis was had more than 17 years of service with the Department of Criminal Justice, and Garcia had nearly 23 years of service. The inmates were serving sentences that ranged from one year for labeling unauthorized recordings to 20 years for drug possession with intent to distribute, according to online prison records. Correctional officer Jason Self, 38, and inmates Terry Johnson, 22, and Damien Rodriguez, 22, were hospitalized in critical condition, the prison system said. Inmates Remigio Pineda, 34, and Hector Rivera, 37, were in serious condition. The bus carrying prisoners and corrections officers fell from an overpass in Penwell, Texas, and crashed onto train tracks below (AP Photo/The Odessa American, Mark Sterkel) Only the driver's seat had a seat belt, he said. Like many buses, the vehicle did not have seat belts on the bench-type seats where the prisoners were seated. The prisoners were handcuffed together in pairs, but did not have leg restraints. Some of them were ejected from the bus after it struck the train, said Trooper Elizabeth Barney of the Texas Department of Public Safety . The overpass on Interstate 20 was slick with ice Wednesday morning when the Texas Department of Criminal Justice bus left the roadway in Penwell, just west of Odessa, according to Ector County Sheriff Mark Donaldson. An earlier accident on the I-20 overpass may have contributed to the prison bus losing control, Donaldson said. 'It's as bad as you can imagine,' Odessa Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Kavin Tinney told the Odessa American newspaper. 'In 32 years it's as bad as anything I've seen.' Jason Clark, a Department of Criminal Justice spokesman, said the bus was new and had been placed in service only this past summer. It was taking the inmates from the Middleton prison in Abilene to the Sanchez prison in El Paso, which is about 250 miles west of where the accident happened. After the accident around 7:30 a.m., the white bus came to rest on its side, next to the railroad tracks, crumpled with heavy damage to its front and undercarriage. The top of the bus was caved inward. The Union Pacific freight train with four locomotives and 58 cars came to a stop soon after. None of the cars derailed, but two containers at the rear of the train were damaged, said Mark Davis, a railroad spokesman. The containers were carrying hundreds of parcels and packages, many of which were strewn along the tracks. No Union Pacific employees were injured.

"An Iowa lottery worker who illegally played the lottery won a multimillion-dollar jackpot in 2010 then asked others to help him claim it, authorities have said. Eddie Raymond Tipton, 51, of Norwalk, Iowa, has been charged with two felony counts of fraud. Authorities had been trying to identify the winner of the $14.3 million Hot Lotto ticket since a New York lawyer tried to claim the prize shortly before the one-year deadline in 2011. Tipton, who is the director of information security for the Multi-State Lottery Association, is being held at the Polk County Jail on a $10,000 cash-only bond. The association oversees several popular lottery games, including Hot Lotto and Powerball and employees are banned from buying tickets or winning prizes. When attorney Crawford Shaw tried to claim the jackpot with the winning ticket in his hands, lottery officials confirmed the ticket was valid. But they refused to pay because Shaw wouldn't name anyone involved with the purchase and handling of the ticket. He later withdrew the claim and said he didn't know the winner's identity. Authorities have not said whether Shaw or anyone else would face charges in the case. Authorities released a convenience store video in October which purported to show the mystery winner, in an attempt to help identify him. At the time it wasn't known if the winner was involved in possible fraud or was was the victim of a crime. A former co-worker of Tipton's subsequently contacted authorities and tipped them off. Detectives then  analysed the ticket purchaser's voice in the video and matched a license plate in the parking lot of the convenience store to Tipton. Authorities say Tipton contacted two men in Texas asking for help to claim the jackpot anonymously. One man attended school with Tipton; it's unclear how Tipton knows the other man. The men then contacted Shaw and a Canadian man for further help, according to an arrest affidavit. Shaw and the Canadian man listed themselves on a newly created trust to collect the lottery prize. Tipton won $14.3 million playing hot lotto and was dobbed in by a colleague who recognised him on a tape authorities released in the hope of identifying the person who had purchased the winning ticket . While trying to claim the ticket Shaw told lottery officials the trust's proceeds would go to a corporation in Belize, a country known as a tax haven. Shaw soon withdrew his claim and said he didn't know the winner's name. In October, officials had said Shaw was cooperating in their investigation. Iowa Lottery CEO Terry Rich yesterday said the case was one of the strangest in the history of the lottery. 'We believe this is the largest lottery jackpot ever to be claimed, only to have that claim withdrawn.' The prize money was eventually returned to the states participating in Hot Lotto.

"Violent and bloody protests have erupted around the world as furious Muslims react to Charlie Hebdo's 'survivor' edition - again featuring the holy Prophet Muhammad on its front cover. As pictures emerged of a photographer shot in the chest during riots in Pakistan - so did the news of churches being burned down in Niger, and equally violent clashes in Jordan. A bullet reportedly struck Adif Hasan's lung and passed through his chest, as 200 protesters took to the streets outside the French consulate in Kuratchi. It's believed he was shot by demonstrators, and although his condition was at first thought to be serious, he was now said to be recovering. Scroll down for video . Photographer Adif Hasan clasps his chest as bloods spills from the bullet wound, after he was shot as Charlie Hebdo protesters clashed with police in Pakistan outside the French consulate . Hasan rests in a vehicle, out of harms way; the bullet was said to have struck his lung and passed through his chest; the photographer is now said to be recovering .

AFP news director Michele Leridon said that Hassan underwent surgery and that 'his life does not seem in danger'. Two other people are said to have been injured. Pakistani authorities used tear gas, batons and water cannons to disperse angry crowds who tried to force their way into the consulate. Police were also said to have fired warning shots in the air. The rallies come a day after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif led parliament in condemning the cartoons published by the magazine whose officers were attacked last week, resulting in the deaths of 12 people. Religious leaders had called for the magazine's journalists to be hanged and urged their followers to join the protests. Meanwhile, the Niger government confirmed four people were killed as the police clashed with protesters who attacked a French cultural centre and set churches ablaze. Police fired tear gas to suppress the crowds in the city of Zinder, where angry Muslims burned French flags and attacked Christian shops with clubs and Molotov cocktails. Three civilians died - including two who were shot by police during an attack on their station - Niger's Interior Minister, Hassoumi Massaoudou, said on state televison. The fourth person to be killed was a police officer who was run over,  while 45 other people sustained injuries.

Mr Massaoudou said: 'Zinder experienced a quasi-insurrectional situation, a spontaneous protest of a criminal nature. 'I would like to reassure Christians that the state is here to defend those living in Niger at all costs.' Aboubacar Mamane, a shopkeeper who witnessed the riots, says he saw crowds of mostly youths ransacking the city. He added: 'The protesters are crying out in local Hausa language 'Charlie is Satan - let hell engulf those supporting Charlie'.' The streets were calmer by nightfall, residents have said. As a precaution, the government forbade people to hold a Saturday sermon for the Prophet Muhammad at the main square mosque in the capital, Niamey.

Back in Pakistan, The Telegraph reports that thousands of religious party activists are expected to join the protests nationwide. They are said to include followers of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the charitable wing of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group which masterminded attacks on Mumbai in 2008. The Jamat-ul-Ahrar faction of the Pakistani Taliban has issued a statement lauding the two brothers - Said and Cherif Kouachi -  who carried out the terrorist attack in Paris, saying 'they freed the earth from the existence of filthy blasphemers'. 'O enemies of Islam beware! Every youth of this Ummah (Muslim community) is willing to sacrifice himself on the honour of (the) Prophet,' said the statement, which was sent via email by spokesman Ehsanullan Ehsan. Religious leaders had called for the magazine's journalists to be hanged and urged their followers to join the protests. French flags have been burnt in the northwest city of Peshawar and central Multan and rallies have also been held in the capital Islamabad and the eastern city of Lahore. Thousands also took to the streets of Amman in Jordan protesting over the magazine . Police in full riot gear holds back crowds of protesters in the streets of Amman .

Clashes also broke out in the Jordanian capital of Amman, between security forces and about 2,000 protesters organised by the Muslim Brotherhood - the country's largest opposition group. Riot police used batons to disperse the people as they tried to march towards the French Embassy. The crowd chanted slogans against Charlie Hebdo and Jordanian officials for taking part in a unity march in Paris on Sunday. The Jordanian royal household denounced Charlie Hebdo's latest cover, saying publishing the cartoon was 'irresponsible and far from the essence of freedom of expression'. King Abdullah and Queen Rania, however, took part in the Paris march in solidarity with the victims of the terror attack. Yesterday, the Royal Jordanian Hashemite Court issued a statement calling the cartoon insulting, irresponsible and reckless.","Photographer Adif Hasan is now recovering after being shot in the chest .

"A 20-year-old Ohio man charged with plotting an attack at the U.S. Capitol has appeared in court where he was refused bail. Christopher Lee Cornell was branded 'a danger to the community' by U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Bowman in a brief detention hearing Friday afternoon. He was brought to the federal courthouse in downtown Cincinnati under tight security from the jail some 30 miles away where he's been held since after his arrest Wednesday outside a gun shop. Held without bond: Christopher Lee Cornell allegedly plotted to attack the U.S. Capitol in Washington and kill government officials inside it and spoke of his desire to support the Islamic State militant group . Cornell planned to 'wage jihad' by attacking the Capitol with pipe bombs and shooting government officials and employees, the FBI said in court documents. 'I feel that the danger to the community is such that I cannot order bond today,' Bowman said, noting that messages attributed by federal authorities to Cornell had him discussing extreme violence. She agreed with the recommendation by Tim Mangan, an assistant U.S. attorney, who called Cornell a flight risk and a danger to the community for allegedly creating the kind of terrorist plot that 'is the most pressing threat to our public safety.' An assistant federal public defender, Karen Savir, had asked that Cornell be released with electronic monitoring to his parents' apartment in suburban Cincinnati. She said he had no history of serious trouble and didn't even have a passport. She added that he was 'eager to appear in court' to defend against the allegations. Cornell was detained without bail on suspicion of plotting 'the most pressing threat to our public safety' She also told Bowman that Cornell wants to be addressed by his Muslim name, Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, and have access to a prayer mat and a clock so that he can continue his religious practices in the Butler County Jail. He also wants to be taken off suicide watch, she said. Wearing county jail clothing with orange-and-white stripes and in ankle shackles, Cornell spoke quietly at the defense table with Savir. His parents and other family members were in the front row and were warned to be quiet after shouts including 'Love you, Chris!' Cornell's father, John Cornell, has said his son was set up by a 'snitch' who was trying to help himself. Cornell (pictured left years ago) posted messages on Twitter sympathizing with Islamic terrorists led to an undercover FBI operation. His father John Cornell (right) claims his son was coerced into the plot . He described his son as a 'mommy's boy' who spent hours playing video games in his bedroom. He also said his son was 'at peace' after becoming a practicing Muslim. 'He was dragged into this,' Cornell said before the hearing. 'He was coerced.' His son had long expressed distrust of government and the news media, and local police said he disrupted a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013. The FBI said he had for months sent social media messages and posted video espousing support for Islamic State militants and for violent attacks by others. Cornell told an informant they should 'wage jihad,' authorities said in court papers. Similar stings in recent years have led to accusations of entrapment. But the FBI has argued such stings are vital for averting deadly terror attacks, and juries have returned tough sentences. It was unclear from court papers if Cornell had made contact with any terrorist groups.","Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, is charged with attempting to kill a government official .

"It could be a godsend for games fans - and make iPhone games even more addictive. A newly unearthed patent application reveals plans for a spring loaded home button that pops up to become a joystick when needed. The 'multi-function input device' shows an iPhone or iPad home button that changes into a small joystick for gaming. It is believed the button would retain the current Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and that a single click would cause it to pop up and transform into a slightly elevated thumb joystick. A simple push of the elevated home button back into a flush position with the body of the iPhone would return it to its original state when done gaming, the patent diagrams show. It is believed the button would retain the current Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and that a single click would cause it to pop up and transform into a slightly elevated thumb joystick.

A simple push of the elevated home button back into a flush position with the body of the iPhone would return it to its original state when done gaming, the patent diagrams show. 'The multi-function input device is operable in at least a first mode and a second mode,' the patent says. 'In one example, the multi-function input device may have a button mode and a joystick mode.' Diagrams included in the application show a very low-profile joystick. 'The input device head may not project outward from the surface when not being used as a joystick, thus avoiding compromising aesthetic appearance of the electronic device, preventing potential damage to mechanisms utilized to project the input device head, and/or keeping the input device head out of the way when not being utilized as a joystick.' Apple also admits that for some games, a touchscreen is not ideal. 'Touch screens (which may be well suited to applications such as an Internet browser application) may offer some advantages for operating game applications on portable devices, but they may also have shortcomings. 'For example, a user's finger may need to cover part of the screen while the user is controlling the game. A simple push of the elevated home button back into a flush position with the body of the iPhone would return it to its original state when done gaming, the patent diagrams show. 'This may interfere with the user's ability to see what he is controlling and/or other portions of the game display. 'Additionally, a touch screen may be unable to provide tactile feedback and the ability to provide tactile feedback during a game may enhance the user's game experience. 'Some gamers hold the opinion that realistic game play cannot be fully experienced without joysticks and/or tactile buttons.'","Button would pop up to reveal a small thumb joystick .

"If you've ever wanted to own an 'Iron Man' exoskeleton, then now could be your chance – as long as you have $1 million (£659,000) to burn. A Japanese electronics firm is selling a 13ft (four metre) mechanical suit on Amazon which can be controlled by an iPhone or by stepping inside the device. Dubbed Kuratas, the five-ton, four-wheeled device was the brainchild of inventor Kogora Kurata from Japan's Kanto region. Scroll down for video . A Japanese electronics firm is now selling a 13ft (four metre) mechanical suit on Amazon which can be controlled by an iPhone or by stepping inside the suit . 'It seemed unlikely that anyone would develop giant robots however long I waited. And so I thought, I might as well make one myself - that's how it started,' Kurata said in an interview with Zoomin.TV. Kuratas can be operated using a 'Master-Slave system' where users control the robot's movements from outside using any device with a 3G network. They can also step inside the suit to control its movements in the same way as exoskeletons are used for fictional characters such as Iron Man. Overall, the robot has around 30 hydraulic joints which the pilot moves using motion control. It comes in 16 colours, including black and pink. Kuratas can be operated using a 'Master-Slave system' where users control the robot's movements from outside using any device with a 3G network. Pictured on the right is an early prototype . It can also be fitted with a futuristic weapons system, including a gun capable of shooting 6,000 BB bullets a minute, which fires when the pilot smiles . Asers can also step inside the suit to control its movements in the same way as Iron Man (pictured) Currently Kuratas is not capable of walking, but is able to drive at 6mph (10 km/h) It can also be fitted with a futuristic weapons system, including a gun capable of shooting 6,000 BB bullets a minute, which fires when the pilot smiles. 'Automatic alignment allows you to lock on your enemy target. Kuratas will not allow any targets to escape,' the company writes. 'With the alignment set appropriately the system will fire BBs when the pilot smiles.' Realising that there may be a flaw with this system of opening fire, a video warns the pilot against smiling too much while operating the Kuratas weaponry. However, there is another major caveat. The robot is advertised as a kit, which means whoever buys it will also have to put it together. The exoskeleton would allow firefighters to easily rescue and carry people out of fires . A radical new suit for the firefighter of the future has been revealed that could give them superhuman strength. The exoskeleton would allow firefighters to easily rescue and carry people out of fires, or take heavy equipment up flights of stairs inside a burning building. It can be fitted with a range of gadgets for different missions, including a high pressure water hose that clips onto the arm. 'Each year, an estimated 15,500 high-rise structure fires cause 60 civilian deaths, 930 injuries, and $252 million in property loss,' said Melbourne designer Ken Chen. 'High-rise buildings can hold thousands of people well above the reach of fire department aerial devices, once the fire is above the operational reach of aerial ladder or elevating platforms the chance of rescuing victims is near zero.' To help solve the problem, Chen designed a strap on exoskeleton to boost firefighter's strength and allow them to easily climb high buildings. 'The A.F.A exoskeleton suit aim to increases firefighters’ performance in walking, running and carrying while high-rise fire fighting,' he explained. Dubbed Kuratas, the five-ton, four-legged device was the brainchild of inventor Kogora Kurata from Japan's Kanto region.

"As many as 150 defendants could walk free after a heroin-addicted FBI agent ingested the evidence against at least 28 alleged drug dealers. Investigators claim that agent Matthew Lowry, who worked on the heroin task force in Washington, used his position to steal seized heroin from the evidence room which he then used for more than a year. Dozens of charges have already been dismissed against defendants. As many as 150 defendants could walk free after a heroin-addicted FBI agent ingested the evidence against at least 28 alleged drug dealers; Lowry signed the drugs out of police evidence using the name of his superiors . Lowry checked out drugs from cases he had worked on the pretense that he was having them tested at a lab but would then take them home, sometimes for months, before having them tested (stock image) Lowry was reportedly able to conceal his thefts for over a year in part because of FBI regulations that allowed him to transport the drugs alone in his own vehicle. According to the Washington Post, which cited FBI documents, Lowry has told how he checked out drugs from cases he had worked on the pretense that he was having them tested at a lab. He then reportedly kept the drugs, sometimes for days but at other times for months, and used a small amount each day before submitting them for testing. Once testing was complete, Lowry would return the drugs to the FBI. A form Lowry used to check drugs out which caused the case against one defendant to be dropped . Agent Matthew Lowry used his position on the heroin task force to access the drugs which he took home on the pretense of having tested, only to then use them himself . According to court documents, Lowry forged signatures of superiors to authorize withdrawals and used colleagues' names when resealing evidence bags he had opened. To lessen the chances of getting caught, Lowry often targeted cases that were already resolved in the hope that no one would notice the missing evidence. Lowry told investigators he often used laxatives or creatine to refil the bags of heroin. According to the newspaper, a recent FBI investigation found that 'every one of the nation's field offices had problems' tracking gun and drug evidence and that in some cases, 'drugs disappeared for months without notice'.","Heroin task force agent Matthew Lowry took drugs from the evidence room .

"A man who sued Sotheby's for £11million after claiming they sold an Old Master by Caravaggio for just £42,000 yesterday lost his High Court damages claim. Lancelot William Thwaytes, who inherited the work known as The Cardsharps from a cousin, now faces paying a huge chunk of a £6million legal bill. Mrs Justice Rose cleared Sotheby's of any negligence over its assessment of the painting and said the firm was entitled to rely on its Old Masters specialists in deciding its quality was 'not sufficiently high to indicate that it might be by Caravaggio'. Old Master: The Cardsharps by Caravaggio, who was born in Milan in 1571 was at the centre of the legal fight . Mr Thwaytes had argued that if Sotheby's had done its job properly he could have got much more for the painting. Mrs Justice Rose ordered Mr Thwaytes to pay £1.8m of Sotheby's £3.75m bill within 14 days. Although he has insurance worth £2.4m he must also pay his own legal costs put at over £2m. The firm's lawyers said his claim was never worth millions and was 'bonkers'. Mr Thwaytes is considering an appeal. Sotheby's said in a statement: 'Sotheby's is delighted that today's ruling dismisses all claims brought against the company and confirms that Sotheby's expertise is of the highest standards. 'After a four-week trial in which five witnesses for Sotheby's and three independent experts gave testimony, the judge concluded that Sotheby's was not negligent and that the Sotheby's Old Master Painting specialists who assessed the work were 'highly qualified,' examined the painting 'thoroughly,' and reasonably came to the view that the quality of the painting was 'not sufficiently high' to merit further investigation.'

"Overnight trips to Rome could become even more expensive as the Italian capital considers hiking its hotel tax just four months after it was doubled. The proposal calls for the tourist tax to increase to €10 a night (approximately £7.60) at five-star hotels, according to local media, despite fears that it would deter tourists from planning a holiday in The Eternal City. It comes after Rome’s government hiked the tax to between €3 and €7, depending on the type of hotel, last September. Tourists would be forced to pay even more while staying in Rome if the city's hikes its luxury hotel tax . The Italian Hotel Association, which represents angry hotel owners, announced that it is ‘concerned’ by Rome’s decision to increase the tax at luxury hotels. Giorgio Palmucci, the association’s president, told media that the local council ‘takes no account of the dynamics of the tourist market that could be an important key to development and jobs for the city.’ He questioned whether tourists would see any additional services following another tax increase and pointed out that cities such as London and Madrid do not apply a tourist tax, while Paris’ tax is ‘marginal’. Local media say the tax would increase to €10 a night at five-star hotels (pictured: Regina Hotel Baglioni) He added: ‘There is no doubt that such a chose will not have negative impact on businesses but also on the image of the city.’ Hotelier Steve Brenner told The Local that a tax increase for luxury hotels would affect the broader tourism industry, calling it a ‘very shirt-sighted plan’ from an ‘out of touch’ government. The owner of The Beehive Hotel in central Rome said: ‘I had ten people come in the other day. It was €157 in tourist tax for their stay, I was embarrassed.’ He said he has seen little evidence that the tax is being used to improve services for tourists or residents. Rome's hotel association fears another tax increase would deter tourists from planning a holiday in the city . Last September, when the tourist tax was doubled, the World Travel & Tourism Council said hotels risked losing business as it would drive tourists away and heavily punish Rome’s travel and tourism sector. It said the ‘punitive’ tax sends the message that travellers are not welcome in Rome and its tourism industry ‘does not matter’. The organisation is calling on the ‘counter-productive’ tax, which was introduced in 2010, to be scrapped.","Local media say the tourist tax would increase to €10 at luxury hotels .

"Keepers at a British zoo have welcomed the arrival of a baby pygmy hippopotamus born to a cancer-stricken mother. The male calf weighs just seven kilos and has yet to be given a name, but is said to be enjoying the water pool at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire. His mother Flora, who has two other young, gave birth on Boxing Day while battling a cancerous tumour in her mouth. The male calf was born on Boxing Day at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire. He is yet to be given a name, but is settling in well to life in the enclosure with his parents and older siblings . Due on Christmas Day, the calf was delivered after a six hour labour at the breeding zoo in December . The rare species of hippo is classed as endangered, with only 2,000 remaining in the wild. They are the smaller cousins of the hippopotamus, weighing less than a 1/4 of an adult hippo once fully grown. After being welcomed on Boxing Day, the calf at Whipsnade Zoo has been settling into life with siblings Sappo and Georgina. The smaller cousin of the common hippopotamus, pygmy hippos are only half as tall and weigh a quarter of the larger breed. They are known to be gentler towards other animals, often ignoring each other in the wild. Calves are known to spend their first few weeks staying close to water as their mothers forage for food. Pygmy hippopotamuses originate in West Africa, and are largely nocturnal. As such little is known of their day-to-day behaviour in the wild. They have been listed as an endangered species by the London Zoological Society, with only 2,000 remaining in the wild. Predominantly found in Liberia, their population is most threatened by deforestation. 'Since the birth, the baby hippo has been happily waddling around and seems to love spending time in water,' said Steve White, a senior keeper at the zoo which nurtures several breeding programmes. 'On his first weigh-in, he was so slippery it was like picking up a big bar of soap.' His mother Flora received treatments for cancer throughout her pregnancy which saw the calf born a day late. 'Flora's calf was due on Christmas Day, but the little one kept us waiting until the evening of Boxing Day,' added Mr White. 'We knew Flora must be going into labour because she went off her food which never happens. 'After a six-hour labour, the calf was born. He is a perfect miniature of his mum.' 'We're delighted for Flora, who has come through a difficult year and is now proving once again to be an attentive, experienced mum. 'She's contributed three calves to the European Endangered Species Breeding Programme and she will now retire from breeding.' Weighing just seven kilos, the calf will stay close by his mother's side until weaning. He is the third calf born at Whipsnade Zoo as part of its endangered animals programme .

"An 18-year-old has been arrested in connection with Christmas cyber attacks on Playstation and Xbox networks following a joint investigation between the FBI and British police. The 'quiet' teenager, named locally as Jordan Lee-Bevan, was arrested during a raid at his semi-detached home in Southport, Merseyside, today, with officers seizing computers as he was taken away in a police car. It comes after thousands were refused access to Sony and Microsoft servers over the Christmas period. An 18-year-old has been arrested in connection with an ongoing investigation into hacking which disrupted thousands of Xboxes and Playstations over Christmas (file image) The cyber-attack, thought to have been created by hacker group Lizard Squad, shut down some services for five days. Scores of gamers were left unable to play Christmas gifts or interact online as a result of the disruption. While it is unclear whether today's arrest is in direct connection with the Christmas day attack, investigating authorities said it was 'significant' in the pursuit of cyber crime. The teenager, described by neighbours as 'quiet', is suspected of unauthorised access with intent to commit further offences and threats to kill. He is also suspected of 'swatting', a cyber activity which involves making hoax calls via Skype. In this case he is thought to have targeted US law enforcement agencies, and is also suspected of threatening to kill. The latest arrested follows that of Vincent Omari, 22, from Twickenham, south-west London, who has been linked to the lizard squad and was detained shortly after the cyber attack. He was questioned on suspicion of fraud by false representation and Computer Misuse Act offences before being bailed to March 10. Omari, who is a student of network security and ethical hacking, has said he is simply a spokesman for Lizard Squad - and denied having any part in the attack on Sony and Microsoft. Craig Jones, Head of the Cyber Crime Unit at South East Regional Organised Crime Unit said: 'We are still at the early stages of the investigation and there is still much work to be done. Police arrived at the home of the teenager (above) where, neighbours said, they were allowed entry . 'We will continue to work closely with the FBI to identify those who commit offences and hold them to account. 'Offences referred to as ‘swatting’ involve law enforcement forces in the United States receiving hoax calls via Skype for a major incident in which Swat teams were dispatched. DCC Peter Goodman, National Policing Lead for Cyber Security at the Association of Police Officers added the arrest was 'significant' in ongoing investigations. ''This arrest demonstrates that we will continue to pursue those who commit crime with the false perception they are protected within their own homes or hiding behind anonymous online personas. 'We urge industry, communities and individuals to protect themselves by implementing basic security measures whilst taking full advantage and enjoyment the opportunities the world wide web provides.' Neighbours in the quiet residential street expressed their shock at the development which came as a fleet of police cars descended on the area this morning. One, who did not wish to be named, said: 'He is very quiet young man. I don't know him very well - he stayed in his bedroom a lot. 'I haven't seen the family yet but I imagine it will be a big shock. Another added: 'He is very quiet. I'd see him coming in and out of the house but he didn't really say a word. By MARIO LEDWITH . Lizard Squad is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective Anonymous and is described as ‘vocal, taunting and bit obnoxious’. The group seeks to cause mayhem online ‘for a laugh’ and has called itself the ‘next generation Grinch’ after the children’s character that hates Christmas, often using Twitter to boast of upcoming attacks. Some reports say it mainly operates from Russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world, communicating using the ‘dark web’. Lizard Squad has a history of targeting computer game companies, particularly Sony. In August it sent a bomb threat to Sony chief executive John Smedley, the same month in which it attacked Playstation just to cause ‘havoc’. Dan Holden, of online security company Arbor Networks, said: ‘If they’re coming after you, you’re going to have a bad day.’ Originally hacker group Lizard Squad took credit for disruption over the Christmas period on Twitter . Anonymous, which recently issued a threat to Islamic fanatics responsible for the Paris terror attacks, also claimed to have hacked thousands of accounts in December .

"Prince Philip, pictured, has started using a special mobile phone for the hard of hearing . He only bedgrudgingly started to wear a hearing aid in public a few months ago. But Prince Philip is already making adjustments for it in other areas of his life. The 93-year-old royal has just started using a special mobile phone especially designed for people suffering from hearing loss, it can be revealed. Most high street phones are not compatible for people wearing aids because of the levels of interfearence. And while Philip’s new amplicomms M8000 is short on smart phone-style gimmicks, it can be up to 80 times louder than regular mobiles. It also has a powerful vibrating alert - and a ringtone that can sound as loud as a road drill. The phone also boasts a voice assisted operating system, a large keypad and screen and an SOS emergency button linked to five pre-selected numbers. Despite his age Philip is also something of a silver surfer who regularly uses the internet and was one of the earliest users of a mobile communication device when he had one fitted in his car back in 1953, He will, therefore, no doubt be delighted with the phone’s one touch 2megapixel camera and video recorder. The £99 phone was sent to the Queen’s husband as a gift by Hearing Direct, a firm set up by Prince William and Prince Harry’s close friend, millionaire businessman Jamie Murray Wells. The firm received a standard thank you letter on its receipt. But then shortly before Christmas the company received a call from Philip’s private secretary to say how much he loved it. ‘Apparently the Prince said it was the best he had ever used and his aide asked us if there were any extra accessories to go with it,’ said a company source. Director Gary Hill added: ‘We wanted to offer our support to the Prince, hopefully with a gift that he would find really useful. ‘We spoke to a representative of HRH Prince Philip who said that The Prince is very pleased with the M8000, and it is an improvement on anything else he has used in the recent past. ‘We’ve since sent a car charger and headphones that will help keep conversations private. ‘We hope Prince Philip is benefiting from his new hearing aids. Too many people avoid wearing Hearing Aids, risking exclusion from so much happening around them.’ Prince Philip has only recently started wearing a hearing aid in public which is barely visible, left, and is said to be very pleased with his new mobile handset, similar to the one on the right, with its loud ringtone . Philip was first seen in public wearing hearing aids on each year at a public reception last October. It was a rare concession to his age for the prince, who normally bats off enquiries about his health with a brusque: ‘Do I look bloody ill?’ Just a fifth of people with hearing problems wear an aid because of the apparent ‘stigma’, a study by The University of Manchester found earlier last year. Professor Kevin Munro, Ewing Professor of Audiology at The University of Manchester who worked on the study, said: ‘There still seems to be a stigma attached to wearing a hearing aid, where as there is little stigma now associated with vision loss and wearing spectacles. ‘ .","The amplicomms M8000 mobile is up to 80 times louder than normal .

"BBC workers have slammed one of the corporation's leading offices after being left at work without internet or telephone connections. Staff at New Broadcasting House in West London deemed the building 'unfit for purpose' when, despite a £1billion refurbishment, lifts and dishwashers in the building broke down repeatedly. Among other complaints was faulty equipment, cold canteen food and substandard IT services which left workers 'fed up'. Workers claimed the resources at New Broadcasting House in west London were substandard, with internet and phone connections often breaking down . Their woes were revealed in published in the corporation's in-house magazine Ariel in the form of a letter written by Paul Moss, who works for The World Tonight on Radio 4. 'I had to deal with out telephone system not working, the internet connection breaking down on my computer (""You've got a profile problem, mate"")... and the archive having an ongoing issue,' Mr Moss bemoaned. 'Fed up with trying to work like this, I set off for the canteen but the lift was broken, and the non-automatic automatic door still had its sign apologising for the inconvenience of its continued breakdown.' Mr Moss also complained that the dishwasher seldom worked, and questioned how so many problems were occurring after such a costly refurbishment. 'How did a brand new building with brand new equipment end up with so many of its fixtures and fittings not working properly? And is anyone being held accountable for this?' Other workers have complained about broken microwaves, cold canteen food and no forks to eat with. One worker, who asked not to be identified, said: 'There are 6,000 of us in this supposedly state-of-the art building, but everything just keeps on breaking down. Under construction: In 2007, extensive construction work began at the site in Portland Place . In 2012, after five years of buiding, works were ongoing at the site. More than £1billion is thought to have been spent in the vast refurbishment . 'At first it was put down to teething problems, but a lot of us have been here for a couple of years now and so many things are still breaking down or causing major problems. 'For an organisation like the BBC not to have internet connection or phone service - even if just for a while - is embarrassing. 'The minor stuff, like the broken dishwashers, queues for the microwaves and broken lifts is just normal stuff really, but when you think that £1bn was spend on getting this place ship-shape, it is quite ridiculous.' Building manager Andy Baker said he didn't 'recognise' the building described in workers' complaints. 'Like any workplace of this size there will occasionally be problems that need resolving, but the overwhelming feedback we receive is that New Broadcasting House is a great place to work and we don’t recognise the picture being painted in this letter. 'The Facilities Management team at NBH work hard to ensure the building runs as smoothly as possible.'","BBC staff complained of faulty dishwashers and broken-down lifts .

"They used to be the preserve of frugal maiden aunts and draughty guesthouses, but no more. This winter, there’s a new breed of electric blanket on the High Street that is high-tech, wonderfully cosy and not in the least bit embarrassing to own. From ones you can wear to the one that replaces your duvet, there’s something for everyone. They could even help cut your heating bills because they can safely keep you toasty all night, meaning you can turn off the central heating. So, with temperatures set to dip to minus 10c in parts of the UK this weekend, CHARLOTTE KEMP tested ten of the best. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Kemp (above) tests ten of the latest high-tech electric blankets on the High Street . BEST FOR DAYTIME . Relaxwell Luxury Heated Chocolate Throw, £39.95, johnlewis.com . Cost: Less than 1p to heat for three hours. Washable: Yes, on a 40c wool programme. You have to stretch it back to its original size when damp. No tumble dry. VERDICT: The electric blankets of old were strictly for bedtime, but now you can get smaller blankets like this heated throw to keep you snuggly on the sofa or at your desk. For people like me — married to a skinflint who turns the heating on only for high days and holidays — this is revolutionary. I work from home, which usually means dressing for the Arctic. But within minutes of putting this electric throw on my lap, I’m taking off my body warmer and fingerless gloves. Level five, the hottest setting (approximately 36c) is too cosy — I’m in danger of falling asleep at the keyboard. The more ambient level one (about 21c) is perfect. The lead is 13ft long and it turns itself off after three hours. 4/5 . BEST FOR DUVET LOVERS . Dreamland Sleepwell heated double duvet, £99.95, dreamlanduk.co.uk . Cost: Just 1p to heat all night long. Dreamwell Sleepwell heated cotton duvet . Washable: Machine washable and you can tumble dry it, too. VERDICT: A heated duvet is my idea of heaven and my husband Tom’s idea of hell. He doesn’t even like a hot water bottle, but I’m hoping he won’t notice we’re ‘plugged in’ because this looks and feels just like a normal cotton duvet (you can use it all year round with or without the power on). You put your duvet cover over this as normal — the electricity lead pokes through the fastening at the bottom of the cover. Then you plug it in (at 16ft, the lead is longer than the length of a bed). There are two control panels — one for each side of the bed. It took five minutes to heat up, by which time my make-up was off and I was in my nightie. If Tom complained, I didn’t hear him because I was fast asleep. I thought it was wonderful. 4½/5 . BEST FOR MARITAL HARMONY . Luxury Fitted Electric Blanket, King, £99.95, Scottsofstow.co.uk . Cost: Less than 2p for 8 hours. Washable: Machine washable at 30c and can be tumble dried. VERDICT: Romance often goes out the window in the winter. Instead, it’s all about survival as we begin the nightly battle of the bedclothes. Well, marital relations may now improve thanks to this dual- controlled heated under-blanket. This goes over the mattress followed by your usual bottom sheet. It took the longest to heat up at around eight minutes, but we both liked the fact there are body and feet zones on both sides that can be adjusted independently using the nine heat settings between 45c and 70c. The electric blankets of old were real energy-guzzlers, but this is cheap to run. 5/5 . BEST FOR SINGLE BEDS . Single washable fleece heated mattress cover, £59.99 (on sale at £32.99) morphyrichards.co.uk . Cost: Less than 2p a night. Morphy Richards washable fleece heated mattress cover . Washable: 40c wool cycle. Tumble dry on low heat. VERDICT: My eldest daughter’s attic room is perishingly cold. But I wasn’t sure an electric blanket would be safe because, when I was growing up, you had to make sure it was switched off before you went to sleep. I needn’t have worried. The new generation of wonder warmers cut out automatically if the electrics get too hot. This model, which goes under the bottom sheet, is recommended for children aged from eight years and you can keep it on all night at a low temperature — it goes from 20c to 60c — and takes barely five minutes to warm up. My daughter has never been happier to go to bed. But I couldn’t rouse her the next morning. For teenagers who feel the cold, keep it as a weekend treat or you’ll never get them out of bed. 4/5 . Electric blankets could help cut your heating bills because they can safely keep you toasty all night, meaning you can turn off the central heating, says Charlotte . BEST FOR READING IN BED . Monogram by Beurer Cosy Electric Cape, £54.99, stressnomore.co.uk . Cost: 1p for three hours. Washable: Yes, on a 30c cycle, but only up to five times. Not for tumble driers. VERDICT: In the winter, I like to sit up in bed reading while Tom mindlessly watches reality TV or sport downstairs. Now, I can ditch the jumper and dressing gown and drape this heated cape around me. Made of a fluffy, breathable microfibre, it’s soft against the skin and takes a few minutes to heat up. It fastens with three press-studs down the front and you can fasten the sides if you want to create sleeves. The heat radiates from the back section and you soon forget you’re wearing it. When Tom comes to bed, he bursts out laughing and says I look like a spinster. It’s not sexy, but I’m too cosy to care. There are three heat settings (maximum 60c) and it switches off automatically after three hours to ensure it doesn’t overheat — just don’t forget you’re connected to the mains when you stand up. 3½/5 . BEST FOR TOASTY TOES . Beurer Heating Pad, £24.99, stressnomore.co.uk . Beurer heating pad . Cost: 1p for three hours. Washable: No. VERDICT: My dad moans that there are three in his bed during winter: him, my mum — and my mum’s freezing feet. If it’s only your tootsies that feel the chill, slip this heated pad into the bottom of the bed, and your feet will warm up in no time without the hassle of hot water bottles or bed socks. The controller is pretty basic with a clunking switch, but the 12in-by-16.6in pad heats up very quickly and there are three settings from 55c to 75c. The only downside is if you put the pad at the foot of the bed, you can’t reach the controller because of its short lead, although it’s designed to turn off after 90 minutes. The pad is also ideal for relieving arthritis, neck or back tension — and even period pain. 3/5 . BEST AS A TOP BLANKET . Harmony luxury heated overblanket from Dreamland, £80 for a double, littlewoods.com . Cost: 1p to 2p a night. Washable: Machine washable on a wool cycle and can be tumbled dried. VERDICT: I’m more of a duvet girl, but for traditionalists who like a top blanket, why not turn up the heat with this electric number? It’s super soft and very economical. It comes with dual controls, which cut out those nightly arguments about temperature settings. There are five settings from 21c to 36c as well as a fast-heat setting — not that it’s really needed because the blanket warms up in under five minutes. The downside was Tom managed to kick the blanket off in the night because it’s lighter than a duvet, so I ended up cold again. 3/5 . BEST FOR ACHES AND PAINS . Silentnight Heated Fleece Memory Foam Double Mattress Topper, £99.99, argos.co.uk . Cost: 2.8p for eight hours on the lowest setting. Washable: Only the removable cover. VERDICT: Imagine sinking into a warm bed that moulds to your body and you’ll get a good idea what this topper feels like to sleep on. Silentnight heated fleece memory foam topper . The fleecy cover makes it ultra cosy and the ‘give’ in the memory foam means the body is supported, making it brilliant for those with painful joints who struggle to get comfortable in a normal bed. It comes with dual controls so that couples can choose their own temperature settings. There are also two separate heat zones on each side of the topper — one for the body and one for the feet. I cranked the foot zone up to the max, but preferred a lower heat for the rest of my body. The timer allows you to keep the blanket on from one hour to all night, and because both sides can be on different timer settings, it really is bespoke. Sadly, it doesn’t come in superking size, or I might invest. 4/5 . BEST FOR SUPER-SIZED BEDS . Sleeping Beauty superking fleecy blanket, £72, Debenhams.com . Cost: 3p to 5p per night. Washable: Yes at 40c and tumble dryer safe, too. VERDICT: If you have a superking bed, it’s hard to find an electric blanket big enough. Most brands go up to only a kingsize, but the Sleeping Beauty range at Debenhams has this fleecy under-blanket, which goes over the mattress and you put your sheets on top. It’s actually pretty good value when you see how big it is, and you can’t feel the wires. It also has dual controls so there’s no arguing over the right temperature. Even when it’s not turned on, it adds an extra soft layer to the mattress. I thought it was very comfy. Tom said it was like lying on a dead sheep. 3/5 .","There’s a new breed of electric blanket on the High Street .

"A British couple has been awarded £5,000 in compensation after their stay at a resort in Egypt was ruined by gastroenteritis symptoms. Cristian Magana Salgueiro and Mark Trevelyan fell ill just days after they arrived at the Oriental Resort in Sharm el-Sheikh, a popular Red Sea retreat for UK tourists. Mr Trevelyan was still experiencing gastric problems more than a year after the Somerset couple’s two-week getaway, while Mr Magana Salgueiro’s symptoms continued for two months following their return in July 2013. Cristian Magana Salgueiro (L) and Mark Trevelyan became ill while staying at a resort in Sharm el-Sheikh . Five days in to the holiday Mr Magana Salgueiro, 30, began to experience ‘severe diarrhoea up to 12 times a day, stomach cramps and inflammation of the abdomen’. Mr Trevelyan, 29, also suffered severe cramps, diarrhoea, nausea, sickness and exhaustion. They said they witnessed birds eating from the pasta station and plates on the resort’s terrace, and cockroaches swarming a designated food area during their trip, which was booked through Thomas Cook. The couple said they suffered severe cramps and diarrhoea while staying at the Oriental Resort in July 2013 . When they returned to Britain they both sought advice from their GP, but were asked not to attend their doctor’s surgery in case they may be contagious. Traveller’s diarrhoea was diagnosed and antibiotics were prescribed. The pair hired solicitors from Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose solicitors, to investigate the cause of their illness and they were recently awarded a four-figure sum in compensation. Mr Magana Salgueiro said he is ‘very happy’ with the outcome of the couple’s claim. Anne Thomson, head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, said: ‘I’m very happy we were able to obtain compensation for Mr Magana Salgueiro and Mr Trevelyan. ‘High standards of hygiene in holiday hotels are vital or outbreaks of illness will continue to arise and more holidays ruined. ‘We have recently been contacted by more holidaymakers who unfortunately suffered similar gastric illnesses recently at the Oriental Resort.’ In a statement, Thomas Cook said: 'Thomas Cook is sorry that Mr Trevelyan and Mr Salgueiro fell ill while on holiday at the Oriental Resort in Sharm el-Sheikh in July 2013. We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with their legal representatives and that this matter is now resolved. 'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained. 'We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible while in resort or the UK so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.'","Cristian Magana Salgueiro and Mark Trevelyan stayed at Oriental Resort .

"The religious studies teacher who had sex with a pupil at school and at home when his wife was out has launched an appeal against his sex crime convictions. Stuart Kerner, 44, took the then 16-year-old's virginity on a yoga mat in a store cupboard having brought a contraceptive with him to Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London. Kerner also had sex with the victim in his marital home in the same week his wife miscarried. Yet Judge Joanna Greenberg QC gave him an 18-month suspended sentence because she suggested that the victim may have ‘groomed’ him and he ‘gave in to temptation’. Last night Kerner's solicitor confirmed the disgraced teacher has launched an appeal to overturn the conviction and clear his name. Defence: Stuart Kerner, 44, pictured at Inner London Crown Court with his wife Katherine, will launch an appeal after he was convicted of having sex with a pupil at school and at home . A jury last month convicted him of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust, but he was cleared of four other similar charges. Kerner's solictor Gary Rubin said: 'What I can tell you at this stage, is that not only is he planning to appeal, we actually lodged the appeal with the Court of Appeal well before Christmas. 'It was the advice given to his legal advisors that he should lodge an appeal against conviction. I lodged it within 14 days of his conviction.' During the trial he told the court that his victim, now 19, is a 'vain stalker' who made the relationship up because she is a 'psychopathic liar' who thought 'everyone fancies her.' Kerner claimed the girl had stalked him and used details gleaned from calendars, computers and gadgets in his office to construct 'a fantasy'. His defence barrister Edward Ellis said: 'He's a man who didn't look behind his back, and he was stalked, and information was found out about him for this carefully constructed elaborate ruse. Why? We don't know.' But the jury did not accept his claims, and convicted him last month. Last night the step-mother of the girl accused of grooming her teacher into having sex with her said she has been treated as a criminal rather than a victim. Her comments came as it was announced that the judge who spared RE teacher Stuart Kerner a jail sentence is to be investigated. During a two-week trial, the court heard that Kerner had carried around a condom for a week, telling the girl he would use it on her when she became 'too irresistible' The vice-principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London also took her to his home when his wife was at work and had sex with her in their guest bedroom . Mrs Justice Joanna Greenberg told him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her... It was she who groomed you and you gave in to temptation.' The stepmother of the girl, who is now 19, told the Mail: 'He's the one who's committed the crime, and yet she's the one who was treated like a criminal in that courtroom.' She said the girl was 'devastated' by the sentence. 'What kind of a message does that send out?' she added. 'You can sleep with a schoolgirl and you'll just get away with it? That's disgusting. 'He was in the position of trust and he was the responsible adult. How could it be her fault? How can you blame a 16-year-old schoolgirl? We're all still in shock. 'The teacher slept with her, then called her a s*** and he's been allowed to get away with it.' During a two-week trial, the court heard that Kerner had carried around a condom for a week, telling the girl he would use it on her when she became 'too irresistible'. He had sex with her in a store cupboard on a yoga mat in the same week that his wife miscarried their second child, the court was told. The vice-principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London also took her to his home when his wife was at work and had sex with her in their guest bedroom. In between sex sessions he made her Marmite on toast and they watched Bargain Hunt, Inner London Crown Court heard. The stepmother of the girl said she was 'devastated' after Kerner was given a suspended sentence . His defence tried to claim that the victim had invented a fantasy relationship based on the novel Fifty Shades of Grey, in which a more experienced man has an affair with a younger woman. But the religious studies and ethics teacher was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. His wife Katherine is standing by him. Last night, there was a growing backlash against the judge's decision. Barnardo's executive director of children's services Sam Monaghan said: 'This is the wrong use of the word grooming, it's the wrong message to teachers, parents and pupils, and it's wrong to suggest that a vulnerable child is in any way responsible for their own abuse.' A law firm also warned that judges shouldn't blame victims for the crimes of those who are in a position of trust. Alan Collins, a solicitor with the firm, Hugh James, said: 'The teacher was in a position of trust, and no matter what the girl was saying or doing, he should have realised the danger and the inappropriateness of it all, and stopped it. 'He was the one in a position of power, and it was a breach of trust. 'You can't blame the victim.' Judge who let RE master walk free faces an inquiry . Judge Joanna Greenberg will be investigated by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office after she said Kerner was 'groomed' by the schoolgirl he abused . The judge who spared teacher Stuart Kerner a jail sentence is facing an investigation. Multiple complaints have been received about Joanna Greenberg QC's conduct. Last night, the Judicial Conduct and Investigations Office said it was considering misconduct allegations against her. If a complaint is upheld, it can result in a judge being disciplined, suspended or removed from office entirely. Criticism of her comments and sentencing also gathered pace, with campaigners calling the decision 'wrong' and 'inappropriate' and complaining that it sends the wrong message to other offenders. Meanwhile, members of the public vented their frustrations on Twitter. Leisa Rea wrote: 'Horrified that (former colleague) & teacher #StuartKerner will not go to prison for having sex with a pupil. Judge blamed the child. OUTRAGE.' Liam Dale wrote: 'Change in law needed. #StuartKerner failed as a teacher/mentor to protect a student and pre-planned the acts.' The Journal of Family Health tweeted: 'V disturbed by judge's comment that the pupil had *groomed* her ex-teacher Stuart Kerner. Children don't groom adults! #childsexabuse' On the day of the sentencing, the Attorney General's office said that it was considering whether to refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal. Yesterday, however, it emerged that it is powerless to do so because his offence is not included in the unduly lenient sentences scheme. Judge Greenberg, 64, has 40 years' experience as a barrister, according to her profile on the Charter Chambers website. It adds, jokily: 'Looking at her you simply would not believe she could have been in practice that long.'","Stuart Kerner, 44, to appeal against his convictions for sex with a student .

"For his 50th birthday, Jim Greenan was probably expecting a slap-up meal or a romantic break. Instead, all his wife Claire Potter gave him was a wicker box containing 50 brightly coloured pieces of paper. On each was written a small challenge to be done in order throughout the year. They ranged from the routine (baking a loaf), to the daring (skinny-dipping) and the bizarre (talking like a pirate, volunteering for a police identity parade). Scroll down for video . Taken out of the comfort zone: Jim Greenan with his wife Claire Potter and the box of challenges . Mr Greenan also had to try laughter yoga – a therapy using laughter – and to copy the art of October Jones, who photographs train passengers with cartoon heads superimposed on them. The tasks were devised to fit in around work, holidays and family life in Oxfordshire with the couple’s 15-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter. Miss Potter, a writer, said the idea was to make the year ‘unique and out of the ordinary’. She said: ‘As you get older it can be easy to get in a groove and this has really jolted him out of it.’ So on Mr Greenan’s 50th birthday last January, she presented him with the challenges. One of his favourites was photographing ten strangers, asking permission first, on a family holiday to Warsaw. Miss Potter said it gave them an ‘insight into life in Poland’. Mr Greenan's challenges included eating a whole lobster, left, and sending a message in a bottle, right . Oddly, it was one of the challenges designed to be relaxing and indulgent that caused schoolbook editor Mr Greenan his worst moment – taking a leisurely bath. Miss Potter said: ‘I ran him a bath but only put the hot water in. I told him to put some cold in but he didn’t hear me and scalded his foot. He then managed to pull the plug out and ended up sitting in a few inches of cold water. He got out and said it was rubbish.’ Mr Greenan said: ‘I do like the idea of challenging myself and I’m thinking about doing something bigger this year.’ Miss Potter said: ‘It has been a really good year seeing him try new things that take him out of his comfort zone.’ When she turned 50 in October, her present was more conventional – a bicycle. The couple held a joint 50th birthday party in July at which Mr Greenan played a song he had composed as one of his tasks. He has one challenge left – writing his wife a love letter with 50 things he likes about her. Miss Potter said: ‘I think I deserve that after coming up with all the challenges.’ He was also challenged to go skinny-dipping, left, and buy an item from a charity shop that he wouldn't normally wear, right .

"The parents of a four-year-old boy who they say suffered permanent disabilities after a botched water birth are calling for all water births at an Oregon health center to be banned. In a lawsuit filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Amy Benton and Matthew Marino are suing for $35 million for their son's care and asking a judge to prohibit Legacy Health System from using the method. Legacy has five hospitals in the state and the couple want water births banned at all locations. They say their son Luca was left with cerebral palsy, hearing problems and other disabilities that will need life-long care after the mistakes made on December 14, 2011, according to the Oregonian. Lawsuit: Matthew Marino and Amy Benton, pictured when Luca was a baby, say he suffered life-altering disabilities after they were not warned about the dangers of water births by their hospital in Portland . The water birth never should have even been approved because of complications Benton suffered during the pregnancy, according to the suit, and instead he should have been delivered by c-section. They said they were never warned about the dangers of water births, despite The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics saying its safety has not yet been established. Staff failed to monitor his fetal heart rate continuously and he was not born on time, leaving him deprived of oxygen, the suit says. The staff then failed to resuscitate him immediately, they claim. The suit adds that the hospital allowed midwives and nurses to manage the delivery without an obstetrician and had not been adequately trained. The lawsuit seeks $23 million for Luca's current and future medical expenses, and $10 million for his pain and suffering from cerebral palsy and a brain injury. It asks for another $3 million for the child's 'loss of future hearing capacity'. 'This boy will need a great deal of care the rest of his life,' the couple's attorney Rich Rogers told the Portland Business Journal. Scene: They have asked a judge to ban all water births at Legacy's five hospitals in Oregon, including Legacy Emanuel Medical Center (pictured), where Luca was born in December 2011 . Though not the norm, water births have gained popularity over recent decades. On its website, Legacy says that studies carried out in Europe have shown less pain medication is needed and that less pain is felt during a water birth. It also cites 'high patient satisfaction'. Last year, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a joint opinion that immersion in water during the first stage of labor may decrease pain and the duration of labor. But it also said the safety and efficacy of delivering a baby underwater have not been established. 'Given these facts and case reports of rare but serious adverse effects in the newborn, the practice of immersion in the second stage of labor should be considered an experimental procedure that should only be performed within the context of an appropriately designed clinical trial with informed consent,' it said. They cited on study that found 12 per cent of the babies delivered by water birth were admitted to special care units, whereas none of the babies born outside water were admitted. 'His parents have had their lives greatly altered. The sad thing is, none of it had to happen. Legacy failed to inform Amy and Matthew of the dangers of water birth and failed to provide a safe environment for the baby's birth.' Legacy said it would not comment on pending litigation. The suit was first filed in August 2014 but was filed again after adding more detail. Though not the norm, water births have gained popularity over recent decades. The Legacy Health System website says water birth is available at Legacy Family Birth Centers and at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, the hospital where Luca was born. 'European studies have shown a lower use of pain medication, decreased need for medicines to stimulate labor, decreased perception of pain, and high patient satisfaction, among other benefits, during labor and delivery in a birth tub,' the website states. But the website also says that water births are for low-risk, single pregnancies. In their suit, the couple say that they were not considered low risk due to complications throughout Benton's pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a joint opinion last year that immersion in water during the first stage of labor may decrease pain and the duration of labor. But it said the safety and efficacy of delivering a baby underwater have not been established. Given these facts and case reports of rare but serious adverse effects in the newborn, the practice of immersion in the second stage of labor should be considered an experimental procedure that should only be performed within the context of an appropriately designed clinical trial with informed consent,' it said.","Amy Benton and Matthew Marino say their son Luca was left with cerebral palsy, hearing problems and other disabilities after the botched birth .

The latest twist in the pair's four-year on/off love story comes after fans had decided the two may well have moved on. Come & Get It singer Selena has been enjoying single life since her most recent split from the 20-year-old pop superstar, with whom she has a tumultuous relationship. The Spring Breakers star was the centre of attention at a Golden Globes after party on Sunday night where she mixed with her celebrity pals. She was even spotted holding hands of 25-year-old DJ Zedd, giving showbiz spectators quite the chance to gossip over a potential new romance in her life.

The two looked like a couple as they made their way side by side past a sea of people that included valets and other party goers. Earlier in the evening, she rested her arms on the shoulder of the handsome music man while on the red carpet with model Cara at the InStyle/Warner Bros, party. Perhaps the shots prompted Justin to call. Since their last split in the autumn, he has been linked to Hailey Baldwin and a host of other girls. As they were: A tweet from Justin's Instagram late last year; the couple's passionate relationship has lasted four years, but with plenty of break ups .

They are first thought to have begun dating way back in 2010, going public with their romance at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in February 2011. Their first outing: After months of secretly dating, Justin and Selena went public in February 2011 at the the Vanity Fair Oscar party . First love: The young couple at a Lakers game in Los Angeles in April 2012, they split for the first time in November of that year . For a while all seemed perfect, until the two split  in November 2012. They briefly reunited in April 2013, before getting back together that Fourth Of July. On Selena's 21st birthday that year Justin is said to have surprised her by turning up with a single red rose.

The first split: The duo in November 2012 days before they ended things - although their romance was far from over . Back together: a snap from Selena's Instagram in 2013 . A family vacation with Justin's family in August seemed an indication that things were becoming more stable. This was reinforced when the two were spotted  attending church together. But at the end of September the pair had a furious row at an airport, which seemed the final nail in the coffin of their romance. And apart from occasional tweets the two had not been seen together since the autumn, until Thursday.

"An appeals panel has reversed the conviction of a man who was accused of killing the father and sister of his friend's ex-girlfriend in a fiery attack on their Orange County home. The three-judge panel ruled that Vitaliy Krasnoperov, 29, did not get a fair trial in 2011 when he was convicted of the murders of Jay Dhanak and his daughter Karishma. Authorities argued Krasnoperov  plotted the murder with his friend Iftekhar Murtaza, in an ill-conceived plan to help Murtaza get his ex-girlfriend  back after she dumped him for being Muslim. Vindicated: Vitaliy Krasnoperov is seen here before the start of his trial in Santa Ana, California, judges reversed his conviction the murder of his friend's ex-girlfriend . Attack: Vitaliy Krasnoperov was accused of  torching his friend's ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home . But appeal judges said that during the trial, prosecutors breached an agreement with Krasnoperov by using information he'd provided to authorities on the condition that it not be used against him. Krasnoperov had been convicted of two counts of murder for the 2007 deaths of the Dhanaks and was sentenced to life without parole. The crime was allegedly hatched after his friend, Murtaza, a Muslim, became angry that his ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak's family had opposed them dating. Dhanak's parents were practicing Hindus and told her Murtaza and his Muslim family came from a line of 'beggars and servants'. At the time Dhanak said her Hindu parents also threatened to stop paying her college tuition if she didn't leave her Muslim boyfriend. During his trial, Murtaza . said he went home after the break-up, took ecstasy and starting chatting . with a friend online about how he wished Dhanak's parents were dead. Religious differences: Iftekhar Murtaza, left, dated  Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007, but she broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued . 'I didn't want to kill them,' he told the court, according to Fox News. 'It was just a figure of speech.' 'I was frustrated, I was upset,' he continued, 'I just wished they would accept me.' 'It's almost like I am not human to them, based on the family that I was born into.' Murtaza burned down the family's Orange County home after becoming 'upset' when his then 18-year-old girlfriend dumped him. A pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak was alive when her throat was slit and her body was doused with gasoline and set on fire. Meanwhile, autopsy results showed Jayprakash Dhanak suffered 29 stab wounds to his body. He also had his skull fractured, resulting in a fatal brain injury. A judge recommended the death penalty for Murtaza in December over the murders which he was convicted of carrying out with another friend, Charles Murphy Jr. Accomplice: Murtaza was later convicted of carrying out the killings with another friend, Charles Murphy Jr. Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight . However in the case of Krasnoperov and Murphy, appeal judges ruled that prosecutors called a witness who they would not have known about until he was identified by Krasnoperov. According to the judge's ruling, Krasnoperov had given this information in a proffer statement when plea negotiations were underway but the negotiations later broke down. Krasnoperov's lawyer agreed that witness Jose Velasco could be called during the trial but was not to testify about any conversations with his client about securing a hit man to carry out the killings. Velasco ended up discussing these conversations, in part, during questioning by Murphy's lawyer. Michael Ian Garey, Krasnoperov's lawyer said: 'It is a vindication of Mr Krasnoperov's constitutional rights, and what happened in the trial was really quite unfair.' Howard Gundy, senior deputy district attorney for Orange County said it's likely that Krasnoperov will  be re-tried.","Vitaliy Krasnoperov, 29, was given a life sentence for the brutal 2007 murders of Jaypraykash Dhanak and his daughter Karishma .

Kalyn Thompson, 25, had been teaching less than a year when she was charged with the rape of a teenage student in Oklahoma . She pleaded guilty to second-degree rape in Creek County District Court in Bristow on Tuesday. The former teacher was sentenced to one year the following day with a five-year suspended sentence. Thompson, who is not married and does not have children according to public records, will also have to register as a sex offender. She will be allowed to serve her probation in Rockwell, Texas, where she provided an address to the court. According to NewsOK, the teacher had worked at the school for less than a year when she started texting a teenage student, a junior, in December 2013. The relationship quickly became sexual, according to police. The victim told police that they had sex twice -  once at a local lake and a second time in a Tulsa motel. Police found a receipt for the motel room in her name. The victim's mother found out and ordered the teacher to stop sending text messages her son but she continued. The school found out about relationship after fellow students at the school spotted the teen and the teacher in her truck and took pictures. She resigned soon afterwards. The age of consent is 16 in Oklahoma, but Thompson abused her position of authority, according to police. The boy had been failing in English but quickly he jumped up to a 98 percent grade point average during the inappropriate relationship.

"A drunken airline passenger who ignored warnings from Boris Johnson to calm down on a flight from Malaysia has been jailed for six months. David Morris, 43, became abusive mid-flight following a drunken binge on lagers, whiskey and wine and headbutted a flight attendant. The Mayor of London was returning from a trade trip in the Far East when he tried to intervene and warned the drunkard he might have to be restrained if he did not settle down. Scroll down for video . David Morris (left) was today sentenced to six months in prison for drunkenly headbutting a flight attendant . In a statement given to police on landing, Mr Johnson spoke of the fear in which the drunkard had put the passengers on the Malaysia Air flight. Mr Johnson said: 'Myself and a few other passengers felt we needed to keep an eye on the male the whole time as we were worried about the safety of the crew and other passengers. 'I could tell people were stressed by the male's behaviour.' Morris, 43, of Aldershot, in Hampshire, was arrested by police when the plane landed on December 3. The oil engineer had initially said he did not remember the incident. But at an earlier hearing at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, he admitted assault by beating and being drunk on an aircraft. Boris Johnson looked on as Morris was arrested when the flight arrived in London Heathrow on December 3 . Mr Johnson told a court in a letter he was 'worried about the safety of the crew and other passengers . Prosecutor Pamela Reiss told Isleworth Crown Court how Morris had become increasingly agitated when he was denied further alcohol on the flight from Kuala Lumpur to London, pacing up and down the aisles and shouting abuse. 'Mr Morris' bad behaviour started around two hours into the flight,' she said. 'He was shouting and swearing foul language. There were a lot of f**** and a lot of c****. 'He was interrupting other passengers' peace. You could smell the alcohol on his breath.' When startled staff tried to restrain the drunkard using plastic handcuffs, Morris became more violent, the court heard. 'He was becoming a danger to other passengers. His behaviour was out of control,' Ms Reiss said. Flight attendant Johari Nordin was sitting opposite Morris and trying to put the plastic handcuffs on him when the drunkard headbutted him, leaving him with a swollen lip. 'Myself and a few other passengers felt we needed to keep an eye on the male the whole time as we were worried about the safety of the crew and other passengers. 'I could tell people were stressed by the male's behaviour.' But the court was told Morris was 'horrified' at his behaviour and has no recollection of the flight. Lance Whiteford, for the defence, said Morris had lost his job in the wake of the case and 'been punished enough'. Mr Whiteford told the judge: 'This case has attracted a huge amount of publicity because of the high-profile person who was in the first class cabin with him, and your Lordship will have seen the letter from him. 'As a result of his actions, his job in Malaysia was terminated. 'This man has been punished as a result of his actions.' 'He has no recollection of his behaviour,' Mr Whiteford added. 'He was disgusted with his behaviour. 'He accepts the incident would have been terrifying for crew and passengers. 'This is no lager lout. This is someone who is mystified as to why he behaved in this atrocious way.' Mr Johnson marked the opening of Epsom College in the Malaysian capital as part of his tour of the Far East . Mr Johnson enjoys the view from the City Hall building, which overlooks the Malaysian capital . The case was sent to Isleworth Crown Court for sentence, and a court official said Morris had received a total of six months' imprisonment. Morris, dressed in a dark suit and light green shirt, broke down in tears as Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson told him his behaviour was 'far too serious' for a suspended jail term. Referring to the claim that Morris was not a 'lager lout', Judge McGregor-Johnson said: 'You behaved in exactly the same way as one. 'It doesn't matter whether you come from the front or back of the plane, this court treats everyone equally. 'It's quite clear that you have expressed genuine remorse for your actions and have suffered the consequences with the loss of your job. 'Members of the aircraft crew are entitled to go about their jobs without being assaulted by passengers and a clear message has to go out.'","David Morris, 43, became abusive mid-flight following a drunken binge .

"Potential Republican Presidential candidate Ben Carson said on Thursday that Americans should take cues from ISIS in how to stand up for what they believe in and to die for their cause. The conservative Carson made the statement at the Republican National Committee winter meeting  and certainly raised some eyebrows. While he said ISIS has the 'wrong philosophy' he lauded them for standing up for what they believe in through their violent actions. He likened them to America's founding fathers who waged revolutionary war against the British. Raised eyebrows: Potential Republican Presidential candidate Ben Carson said on Thursday that Americans should take cues from ISIS in how to stand up for what they believe in and to die for their cause. ISIS beheaded journalists last year and shared video of the gruesome attacks. 'We've got ISIS. They've got the wrong philosophy, but they're willing to die for what they believe, while we are busily giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness,' he said. 'We have to change that.' Carson told the audience he knew his controversial comments would get attention from the press but said he'll readily brush them off. 'Now I recognize that there's press here and some of the press will say, 'Carson said that ISIS is the same as the United States,' he said. History of comments: Ben Carson, a retired surgeon popular with Tea Party conservatives known for making controversial comments, speaks at a luncheon during the Republican National Committee . 'They are just so ridiculous, so ridiculous.' Carson made headlines in the past for comparing the United States to Nazi Germany because they both 'work to silence their opponents,' reports CNN. Carson has said he feels an urge to run for president, and that he 'feels fingers from God' pushing him towards his goal. His blunt commentary has made him popular with the GOP and just last month he polled third in a CNN/ORC survey of the potential GOP presidential field, reports CNN. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus told NBC on Thursday that Carson was talking about standing up for beliefs. 'I think what he was saying basically was that you have to believe in what you stand for, and that we have to believe in the ideals of America, I didn't think anything odd of it,' he said. 'I think he was making a point, and I think his point was to stand up for the things that you believe in.'

"Big Brother, Towie, The Farm... just when you think you've seen them all, a new reality show turns up as the new kid on the block. This week, it was the turn of The Real Housewives Of Cheshire - a reality show that stars six WAGs from a county famous for footballers and excess. Each of the women had enough sparkle, slap and sass to outshine even the brassiest drag queen from London's Soho, but there was one housewife who appeared head and shoulders above the rest - Ampika Pickston. Scroll down for video . Ampika Pickston, 32, from Hale came into money after marrying a rich older man but admits she'd never date an unwealthy man. The Real Housewives of Cheshire star also claims that Brits have a stigma of hatred to people who lead luxurious lives . Ampika, 32, got married to Mark Pickston, 54, a multi-millionaire businessman in her twenties and the couple lived an an enormous mansion in Hale, Cheshire, together. But the couple have since divorced and the former glamour model has now set up her own beauty salon in order to keep the cash rolling in. Despite not actually having the only credential needed to be on The Real Housewives Of Cheshire - being a wife - it is clear why ITVBe producers picked her as part of the six-woman cast; she speaks her mind and more. In the first episode of the reality show, Ampika tells cameras: 'I'm not a little rag doll - I'll play with the toys, and when I'm done with you, I'll discard you.' And when I meet her this week at the ITV studios in London, she is exactly the same. Even though it is midday on a rainy weekday afternoon, Ampika is dressed to the nines in vertiginous heels and a tight strapless dress, and wearing more make-up and hairspray than I use in a month. Ampika with her fellow Real Housewives Of Cheshire stars . Ampika is Amazonian tall and beautiful, with a mega-watt smile... and she knows it. She is also unapologetic about how she achieved her lifestyle (by marrying a rich older man) and in the first few minutes of out conversation, freely admits that she would never again date someone with a normal-paying job like a fireman. When I ask her how she feels about being called a scrounger and a gold-digger, she smiles back, completely unconcerned. She says: 'At the end of the day, it's very sad, but beauty is currency and if you're a good-looking girl, you've got the options. 'If a guy comes along and says he is happy to look after you, and he will give you this fabulous lifestyle, if you want to engage in that, then what is the harm? 'It isn't hurting anybody. 'I have been on both sides of the coin; I have had a very privileged life where I haven't lifted a finger, but I've also come back down to earth now and I'm back to the girl that I was before I met my ex-husband - I work seven days a week. 'It doesn't make me a better person or a lesser person. 'This country has got a stigma of hatred towards people that lead very luxurious lives, they're very jealous and envious. 'I'm really sorry that your six numbers didn't come up on the lottery this week - it's not my problem.' Ampika in one of her regular Twitter pictures . Ampika was raised by her father in Oldham and went to a private boarding school, but after leaving at 18, she struck out on her own and was earning very little compared to what she has now. She met Mark in her early twenties and the couple's relationship quickly turned serious. Their 18-year age gap meant that she was heavily criticised by people in her new boyfriend's social circle though and made to feel like a gold digger. She said: 'I had a job when I first met him and I wasn't dependent on his finances, but it wasn't on the same level. 'And I know that a lot of people judged me for getting with someone a lot older. I did say to him, ""You're getting involved in a relationship with me but I don't bring that much to the equation, so people automatically think that I sponge off you.""

'""But I'm happy to look after you and for you to be my wife. And if other people have a problem with that, then it is their problem. It's not our problem."" 'And I thought, that's fair enough.' The couple were married for a few years, but unable to overcome certain differences, they split a several years ago. However, they remain the best of friends and talk on a regular basis.

But while Ampika's ex was able to overlook the fact that she had little money compared to him when they got together, she claims that she would never be able to do the same with any future boyfriends. When I ask if she would consider dating someone with a 'normal' salary, like a fireman, she shakes her head immediately. She says: 'I would be dubious to let my guard down emotionally because I would wonder if he was coming after me for what I had. 'My natural instincts would come up and I wouldn't allow myself to fall for them. 'Because although that person could be ticking all of my boxes, and I could tick all of his, that fear of someone coming into my lifestyle, not because they want me, but because of what I have and all of the trappings that come with that, would automatically make me press the eject button.' Ampika's lifestyle definitely has trappings. She regularly attends champagne-fuelled, red carpet parties in Cheshire and also frequents A-List bashes held by the likes of Elton John. She still lives in a house that costs upwards of £1million and owns 45 pieces of diamond jewelry.

She admits: 'My wardrobe is like the Harrods clearance sale - everything is crammed on every rail and there are handbags shoved everywhere.' It is this millionaire lifestyle that makes the leggy brunette convinced that their television show will become bigger than both The Only Way Is Essex and Made In Chelsea. She says: 'I look at it on a different level to Towie. 'I think that because we're a lot older than the people in Towie, our lives are a lot more interesting and varied. 'They've got to a certain point where there's only so much that you can do, whereas most of us have been there, done that, had the boyfriends, got married, bought the dream house - they've all got that still to come. 'We've done that and are on to the next chapter. 'So I think we've got huge scope. 'It has also got a few more bricks in each house and a few more bits of bling on each finger, so it ups it. 'It makes it more appealing to the eye and everyone wants a slice.' Ampika regularly attends glitzy red carpet parties in Cheshire . Ampika enjoys a champagne-fuelled lifestyle . One person who certainly doesn't want a slice is Ampika's father Paul Fawcett, who is horrified at his daughter's decision to take part in a reality show. She says: 'My father is utterly disgusted. I don't have a close relationship with my mum, I've not seen her for years, so it's just my dad and he is utterly disgusted and ashamed of the fact that I'd want to put my life on display to the public and get hurled abuse at. 'So he might not want to watch it, but I'm sure I'll have lots of other followers.' And one thing she is keen to introduce her followers to is some outrageous Cheshire style. She says: 'Cheshire is chintzy and vibrant - big shoulder pads, big hair, lots of hairspray. 'We're in your face. 'Down south they are a lot more reserved, a lot more classical and chicer. 'They look at the formation of a silhouette as opposed to being embedded in crystals and heavily jeweled, which I tend to go for.'

"Silhan Ozcelik, pictured, was bailed following her arrest at Stansted Airport on Friday afternoon . A British schoolgirl arrested yesterday by anti-terror police after she landed at Stansted Airport has been released on bail after being questioned overnight. Silhan Ozchelik was feared to have run away to Syria to fight against ISIS and was held upon her return to the UK yesterday. Ms Ozcelik was 17 when she went missing in October. It was feared she had become the first UK female to join the war against the jihadis. Her family said Silhan, now 18, was on a humanitarian mission. The Kurdish teenager, from Highbury Corner, North London, left St Pancras International on the Eurostar before making her way to the warzone. Counter-terror police arrested her at 4pm yesterday after she arrived on a flight. She was taken to a central London police station where she was questioned. She was released this evening on bail. She has to return to a central London police station at a date in the middle of February. The Home Office said police had been issued with guidance to be alert to ‘any possible dangers’ adding: ‘These are sensible precautions and are intended to underline existing protective security procedures and inform operational risk assessments.’ Speaking yesterday, Britain's senior anti-terrorism policeman, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said there were 327 arrests for terrorism offences in the UK last year - and increase of one-third on 2013. Scroll down for video . He said: 'Last summer, the national threat level was raised to SEVERE. This means a terrorist attack here is highly likely. At that time we took a number of additional steps to protect communities and the public. This included, but was by no means limited to, additional armed patrols and more visible policing. We also held a counter-terrorism awareness week before Christmas to alert the public to the need for greater vigilance, and we offered specific advice where necessary.' The teenage girl arrived at Stansted Airport, pictured, on Friday, where she was arrested by anti-terror police . Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said that anti-terror arrests had increased by one-third last year . Commissioner Rowley continued: 'But, in light of the attacks in Paris last week, we have been reviewing, alongside our partners, our overall security posture. This is a further step in a process over a number of years of learning lessons from such events. 'For example, since the attack in Mumbai in 2008, we have enhanced our ability to respond effectively to a marauding terrorist attack by expanding our specialist firearms capability and improving the effectiveness of the response and joint working of all the emergency services. More generally we have continued to refine our plans and to enhance our capabilities to respond to a terrorist threat which has evolved and diversified.' Assistant Commissioner Rowley said that the number of calls to the anti-terror hotline has increased 'significantly' over the past few months making 'an important contribution' to keeping the public safe.

"Bollards installed at the entrance to a picturesque Oxfordshire village that boasts David Cameron as its MP has enraged residents who say they look more in keeping with a council estate. The 'ghastly' bollards were put up in Asthall, West Oxfordshire, two months ago to prevent the bridge collapsing in the village. But villagers were taken aback by the unsightly bollards, which stuck out in the area of natural beauty. Villagers in the West Oxfordshire village of Asthall are enraged by the decision to install unsightly bollards . Local say they have to squeeze their cars through the tight gap and there is a danger of it scratching . The bollards were put up to prevent a bridge in the village from collapsing, but locals say they are 'unsightly' The historic and picturesque village of Asthall is home to Patricia Janet, Baroness Scotland of Asthal, former Attorney General . Dominic Wood, owner of the Maytime Inn, told MailOnline the erection of the bollards had impacted on his business. 'You can't even get a decent sized car through without the risk of scratching the wheels. It looks ghastly and is the sort of thing you see on a council estate rather than in the countryside', he said. 'They have over-narrowed the road so much that if you are driving anything wider than a Morris Minor it could get scratched. 'I think it looks horrible, I don't understand why the council did it.' He added: 'As well as the closure of the main walking bridge across the village, it has been a massive issue for my business.' Gill Hill, clerk of Asthall Parish Council, said the installation of the gate and bollards was a 'bit extreme'. She said: 'It does seem rather unattractive in an area of natural beauty. 'It is supposed to only be a temporary measure, but it does seem a bit extreme. We have always endeavored to keep the village looking rural but this looks awful and it is difficult to get through.' Farmer Edward Walker, who has lived in the village since 1969, told MailOnline the village bus had got stuck trying to force its way through the narrow gates and vans were struggling to get in to the village. MailOnline has tried to contact West Oxfordshire District Council for a response. Villagers say the bollards was out of keeping with the natural beauty of the Cotswold village . Asthall Manor (pictured), an Elizabethan manor house, was home to the six Mitford sisters, who were the reality stars of their day . The village bus got stuck trying to get through the new bollards, according to farmer Edward Walker . Asthall is a village and civil parish  about 6 miles  west of Witney. It includes the hamlets of Asthall Leigh, Field Assarts, Stonelands, Worsham and part of Fordwells. For a small village, it is rich in history. It has a former Roman settlement on Akeman Street, which linked Cirencester with St Albans and the village church dates back to the 12th century. Asthall Manor, an Elizabethan manor house, was home to the six Mitford sisters, who were the reality stars of their day. They were known for their beauty, their 'breeding', their title and their vast country estate. It was also in the manor house that Nancy Mitford penned much of 'Love in a Cold Climate' that was first published in 1949. Today, it still boasts well-known public figures.

"At first glance, both photos resemble the familiar ruins of ancient Athens, instantly recognisable from the countless images printed in guidebooks and on postcards from Greece. But while one picture does indeed capture a 2,500-year-old monument to one of the world's oldest civilizations - the other is a shocking example of the disappointing legacy of the 2004 Athens Olympics. The abandoned remains of the Olympic kayak and canoeing venue, built little over a decade ago, bear an eery resemblance to the Dionysus Theatre - one of the city's most popular tourist attractions, which dates back to the 4th century BC. Scroll down for video . Olympic stadium: The 7,600-capacity kayak and canoeing venue, built little over ten years ago, bears an eery resemblance to its ancient equivalent after being abandoned to  nature . Ancient tourist attraction: The Dionysus Theatre in Athens was used for festivals in honour of the god Dionysus after being built in the 4th century BC and is still able to accommodate 14,000 people . The 7,600-capacity stadium appears to be conceding ground to nature, as shrubs burst through the structure's seams between different levels of seating. Located in the Hellinicon Olympic Complex in Athens, the venue once hosted the canoe slalom events for the Greek Olympic Games - which was estimated to cost the nation more than £6billion. It was comprised of a competition course, a training run, and a natural warm-up lake, all of which were surrounded by thousands of seats where the public could watch Olympic stars compete. The drained course now lies in a state of disuse while for the last seven years the country has struggled through a depression, raising questions about how the nation has benefited from the multi-billion-pound event. Former glory: Just 15 days before the 2004 Athens Games began, teams carried out an operation named 'Clean up-Locked down' in a bid to have the new venues looking perfect for the event. The scene is a far cry from what the arena looks like today . Abandoned: Located in the Hellinicon Olympic Complex in Athens, the venue once hosted the canoe slalom events for the Greek Olympic Games which was estimated to cost the country more than £6billion . Ruins: An aerial view of the Greek theatre at Tindari, Frazione of Patti in Sicily, looks remarkably similar to the abandoned Olympic venue . The astonishing pictures were taken by Ioanna Sakellaraki, 25, a photographer from Athens who captured of images while exploring the Olympic sports complexes in 2013 - less than a decade after the Games took place. She said: 'As the particular sports were not popular enough after the Games, the venues were left unused until they gradually ended up in complete decay. 'Few of the other venues had better luck, but in a general context, there was no proper planning with concrete solutions concerning the venues after the Games, so they easily ended up neglected and unused.' Left to nature: The astonishing pictures were taken by Ioanna Sakellaraki, 25, a photographer from Athens who captured the images while exploring the Olympic sports complexes in 2013 - less than a decade after the Games took place . Sad legacy: The arena, now in a state of disuse, was comprised of a competition course, a training run, and a natural warm-up lake, all of which were surrounded by thousands of seats where the public could watch Olympic stars compete . High price: The drained course has been left  in a state of disuse while the country has struggled through a seven year depression, raising questions about how the nation has benefited from the multi-billion-pound event . However, Ioanna, who now studies and works in Brussels, Belgium, still thinks Greece benefited from the Games, despite the shocking reality her pictures reveal. She said: 'During the Olympic Games, a huge infrastructural pattern including the Athens Tram Line, the venues within the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko were developed. 'Moreover, the Karaiskaki Stadium for football, Helliniko Olympic Basketball Arena and the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex (site of the taekwondo, handball, indoor volleyball, and beach volleyball venues) were constructed at the same time. 'According to reports, the overall net economic benefit of the games for Greece was positive even if the post-Olympics planning was not successful enough to make the use of all the sport venues manageable.' Photograpaher Ioanna Sakellaraki said: 'According to reports, the overall net economic benefit of the games for Greece was positive even if the post-Olympics planning was not successful enough to make the use of all the sport venues manageable' Rapid decline: The abandoned arena once hosted kayak and canoeing events at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games . Iconic: The Odeon of Herodes Atticus, built around 161AD, at the Acropolis and Filopappos Monument on Filopappos Hill in Athens, appears to be in better condition than the Olympic kayak venue built ten years ago .

"A law firm has been slammed for issuing a controversial advertisement that targets  young drug users and offers them legal services. The sponsored Facebook advertisement from Sydney based firm LY Lawyers, shows a person cutting lines of white powder and reads: 'Busted with possession or supply of drugs at Field Day? Call Sydney's best drug lawyers!'. Field Day, a popular music festival that runs on New Year's Day each year, saw a record 214 people arrested for drug offences this year, with ecstasy, cocaine, ice, LSD and cannabis all seized by police. Sydney based legal firm LY Lawyers issued this controversial advertisement on Facebook . Field Day, a popular music festival that runs on New Year's Day each year, saw a record 214 people arrested for drug offences this year, with ecstasy, cocaine, ice, LSD and cannabis all seized by police . Using Facebook's sponsored advertisement option, the law firm's commercial would have been shown to a specifically targeted audience, most likely young adults who have 'liked' various festivals and music artists on the social media platform. Since releasing the ad, LY lawyers has been bombarded by critics who claim the firm is playing down the consequences of drug use and normalising the consumption of narcotics. The firm's principle, Adam Ly, told Daily Mail Australia that he has received a message from one member of the public who called him a 'f***ing filthy dog' for rolling out the ad. 'We get plenty of bad feedback all the time, it's just part of the job,' Mr Ly said. He insisted that the commercial did not promote the use of drugs, but rather, presented a means of contact with lawyers who could provide affordable assistance to first time offenders. Principle of LY Lawyers, Adam Ly, insisted that the firm's intention was not to 'take advantage of drug users', but to offer support for young first offenders . 'A lot of these kids don't know where to find a lawyer, end up representing themselves and end up with a tarnished record. They are often good people: university students or young professionals who are just experimenting with drugs,' he said of the clientèle his ad targeted . 'We're very progressive and controversial, but were not unethical or trawling and taking advantage of drug users,' Mr Ly said. 'We are not in the business of promoting drug use– we're in the business of helping those who have been charged with drug offences, and that includes people who go to festivals, and helping them find good legal affordable representation – it's just advertising. 'A lot of these kids don't know where to find a lawyer, end up representing themselves and end up with a tarnished record. They are often good people: university students or young professionals who are just experimenting with drugs. 'They're not the hardened criminals that society abhors they're just kids – they're just generally first offenders 18-23 years old, so if the impression people get is that it's not admirable way of advertising your service – that doesn't have much weight.' 'They deserve to be presented with the best legal representation possible at an affordable price, don't you think?' Despite this, the firm has been slammed by critics who claim they are encouraging the use of drugs . Mr Ly added that a company with the purpose of working alongside criminals, was unlikely to find a way to effectively advertise their services in an uncontroversial manner. 'We're criminal lawyers – were not exactly the most loved profession in the world. We represent people who have been charged with criminal offences,' he said. 'Any criminal lawyer who advertises is not going to have too many fans just by the very nature of the advertisement and the job we do.' The firm commends itself for utilising social media as a means to connect with clients: an unconventional tactic in the world of legal advice. Their Facebook page is filled with memes and links to news articles that relate to criminal convictions, including an image of a cross-eyed puppy which reads: 'I was at the airport; I sniffed a suitcase, that's the last thing I remember'. 'We've been on Facebook for some time so we can connect with clients and we thought it would be a good way to connect with younger generations and first offenders who don't know where to find a lawyer,' Mr Ly said.","Sydney based legal firm LY Lawyers issued the controversial sponsored ad .

'In the 1930's with the already vibrant Art Noveau, and the more recent Art Deco trends spreading across Europe and America, hair became more graphic and bold. The look was short, jaw length hair, with strong shape. Long hair tended to be pin curled at the front to resemble jaw length hair and kept small and tight in a chignon style at the back. Colours were bold, single applications of primary colours; the purest tone. If it was blonde it was the cleanest, purest platinum possible and if it was dark it was deep and strong to give strength and density to the shape.' 1940s: . 'In the 1940's, even in the midst of war with clothing and fabric rationing, people took great pride in their hair. The updos of the 30's continued but hair naturally became longer and darker giving way to beautiful deep rich dark tones which would be set on pin curls then brushed through to create that classic wave of the 40's. Raven haired beauties like style icon Ava Gardener epitomised the 40's and took the lime light with beautiful blondes like Veronica Lake becoming more rarely seen on screen.' 1950s: . 'With the constraints of war at an end, glamour became popular and women wanted to create a hair look that implied 'domestic goddess'. Women looked to the glamour of Marilyn Monroe and the decade's other big Hollywood screen vamps and sirens for inspiration. Intense red coloured lips and platinum blonde hair became popular, highlighting a pale complexion.' 1960s: . 'Women were moving into the workplace and wanted a more manageable and achievable day-time look. Hair colour was kept simple, with the emphasis on natural, healthy-looking colour like nice'n easy Sunkissed. Blonde was still the key colour but a more natural darker blonde with highlights, made famous by Ursula Andress and Bridget Bardot. Darker hair was often given highlights and the sun-kissed look by soaking strands of hair in lemon juice and sitting in the sun.' 1970s: . 'At the beginning of the 1970's a dark natural blonde look remained popular, inspired by Farrah Fawcett from the cult series 'Charlies Angels'. Hair was all about manes of free-falling curls, soft partings and long fringes completed by bronzed skin. However by the end of the era with the 'Punk' movement, women like Toyah Wilcox started to experiment with hair colour. For the first time we saw vivid primary or fluorescent hair colours emerging.' 1980s: . 'Women were opting for intense strong colour to compliment 'power dressing'. Rich brunettes and strong blondes were all the rage, inspired by Dynasty characters' Krystle Carrington (Linda Evans) and Alexis (Joan Collins). On the other hand, the rebellious streak that started with punk continued with women led by Madonna wanting an ever-changing hair colour to go with their unconventional, eccentric clothing.' 1990s and 2000s: . 'During the 1990's and naughties, the whole world went back to blonde all over again! Each season we see the emergence of new hair colour trends, but our love of blondes remains constant throughout. Multi-toned inspired highlights, which can be achieved at home with nice'n easy Sunkissed, or an all over blonde – any shade of blonde in fact, even previously brunette models and film stars turned blonde.' 2010s: . 'With all of the resources available to us today in the 2010s, blonde is still the desired hair colour of choice. The blondes of today are much easier going and less high maintenance. Multi-tonal, sun kissed, sandy blondes have replaced the all over block colours of previous years, allowing for that organic look and feel. We are entering into an era of huge change in hair colour and the way that people perceive hair colour. In the 2010s it should be a part of you not something extra added. With the likes of Scarlett Johansson opting to 'dress it down' instead of 'up' with her tousled sandy, sun kissed locks at this year's Oscars showing her real natural beauty, you can definitely see the change we are heading for!'

She was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary with three of her friends. After the attack, the Wilberforce Sixth Form College student said: 'One of my eyes is now physically impaired and I am blind in it, I will most likely never receive my vision in my right eye again. 'The outer layer of my eyes are permanently damaged and my hair has turned green from the bleach and has fallen out at the front. 'I have burns on my body from all the acidic chemicals inside the bleach and I am in excruciating pain in my eyes. 'They are red raw, it went in my mouth, up my nose and I couldn't breathe.' Miss Smith, 17, who models under the name Toria Melody, suffered burns across her body after bleach was thrown into her face . Prosecutor Stephen Welch said a victim impact report provided by Ms Smith showed she complained of significant physical and psychological injury, but the defence disputed that. 'She says in her victim impact statement she has suffered considerable physical and psychological impact as a result of this,' said Mr Welch. 'However, the ophthalmologist says there is no permanent affect. I have asked the police and they say there is no permanent scaring left on the complainant. The Crown's case is she did make a full physical recovery. 'However, there are a number of elements of psychological harm that have result in this case. The defence dispute that.' Defence barrister Ian Phillip said proceeding without checking her statement with doctors and psychologists could mean an injustice would be done. Judge David Tremberg adjourned the hearing as he said that there was no accurate information about the harm that Morris caused. He said: 'It is most important when you are sentenced the court has accurate information about the harm you have caused. That information is not available yet. 'I am going to adjourn for that. I can give you no indication of your sentence yet. However, you should prepare yourself for the very real possibility of a custodial sentence.' The model said she endured seven years of bullying at school, and feared the attack would ruin the confidence she had managed to rebuild since starting college. During the attack in August last year, bleach entered the model's eyes, mouth and nose, causing her to violently choke . She said: 'It took me a year to finally start leaving my house and going to college after not going to school for more than a year and being so terrified of people after being bullied for over seven years. 'This has 100 per cent set me back and I honestly cannot see myself coming out again for a long time after realising just how cruel bullies nowadays really are.' Hundreds of wellwishers commented on her Facebook post after reading details of the attack. One said: 'I don't know you, but you are a shining star writing this showing that these bullies haven't defeated you. Well done, you are a beautiful girl too, don't let bullies make you feel low.' Miss Smith later responded: 'Thank you everyone so so much for all your support! It means the world to me I really appreciate it. 'Don't know what I'd do without you all honestly, every single one of you have helped me a lot.' Morris, from west Hull, was bailed and ordered to attend court again on Friday when she will be sentenced. The teenage model was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary with three of her friends after the attack .

"With a wardrobe packed with high-end garments and the most acclaimed designers on speed dial, it's surprising that Gwyneth Paltrow still manages to put a stylish foot wrong. The 42-year-old actress suffered another fashion faux pas as she appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday evening. The mother-of-two failed to impress - and became the target of style critics - when she stepped out in an unflattering nude pantsuit with ruffle details by Elie Saab. Scroll down for video . Gwyneth Paltrow suffered a rare fashion faux pas in Elie Saab as she appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday evening . ELIE SAAB Pre-Fall 2015 jumpsuit . Go nude . Visit site . On the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Gwyneth stepped out to greet the crowd with a huge grin...but it was a shame that Elie Saab jumpsuit wasn't a huge success. Fashion Finder wasn't convinced on the piece. It seemed to cling in all the wrong places and the style did the star no favours. But that doesn't mean that blush jumpsuits are out of the question. Because while Gwyneth may have made a fashion faux-pas with her ill-fitting piece, you don't have to. We have been scouting around for some alternatives and we think we've come up trumps. If you've got a big budget, then the Valentino piece gets the thumbs up and what's more, is that it's got almost 75% off - so get shopping ladies if you want a designer bargain. But Boohoo and Missguided have great cheap and cheerful options available, so don't feel priced out - there's something for everyone.

Kaelen rose tie front jumpsuit at Avenue 32 . Visit site . Featuring loose-fitting wide legs that swamped her lithe limbs, the  jumpsuit certainly wasn't one of the Oscar-winning star's best outfit choices. Gwyneth teamed her nude number with a pair of towering black strappy sandals, and wore her blonde locks poker straight around her shoulders. The Pre-Fall 2015 piece, which isn't even available until the summer, seemed to cling in all the wrong places and the style did the star no favours. Gwyneth's exact garment won't hit stores until July but the Lebanese fashion designer has similar offerings on sale for well in excess of £1,000. The actress made the bizarre decision to slip her svelte physique into an odd nude pantsuit with ruffle detail . A similar style, the stretch crepe jumpsuit, retails for £1,775 in Selfridges. Describing the piece, the site says: 'Epitomising the west-east culture fusion of designer Elie Saab this stretch-crepe jumpsuit is bound to become an essential for glamorous evening occasions. 'Pretty knot detailing and a chic silk panel embellish the front while a fitted waistband makes it a flattering choice for the most sophisticated of females.' Speaking about Gwyneth's fashion fail, style blogger Lydia Rhodes, said: 'I was so disappointed to see Gwyneth in this unflattering ensemble. 'Elie is the king of fairy tale creations but this jumpsuit failed to hit the mark. Elie, who has dressed everyone from the Royal family to Beyonce, usually serves up the loveliest of gowns in the most delicious colour palettes. 'Perhaps Gwyneth needed to opt for a size bigger to avoid the dreaded camel toe and cling.' The Twittersphere was equally unimpressed. One user said: 'Gwyneth looks like a naked mole rat in this jumpsuit', while another added: 'If what she wore on Fallon last night was any indication, we're in for an epic Gwyneth Paltrow meltdown in 2015.' The mother-of-two teamed her nude number with a pair of towering black strappy sandals. While the garment isn't available until the summer, a similar style is on sale on in Selfridges; the stretch crepe jumpsuit, right, retails for £1,775 . Twitter came alive with criticism when Gwyneth stepped out, with one user comparing her to a naked mole rat . Social media reactions to Gwyneth's outfit on Twitter - with people less than impressed . One fashion critic questioned if Miss Paltrow's outfit was the most 'ill-fitting' look of the year . Writer Bethany Ramos even wrote an open letter addressed to the jumpsuit in question. Writing on SheKnows.com, she proclaimed: 'The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew I would never be the same. Seeing you in all of your nude, ruffly pantsuit glory as you hugged Gwyneth Paltrow's svelte figure on The Tonight Show... well, let's just say the camel toe has never looked so good. 'How does that saying go? ""Celebrities, they're just like us."" Gwyneth Paltrow's pantsuit, you have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the elite, upper-crust and often unfairly hated Gwyneth is just a woman of the people. 'Maybe Gwyneth had a temporary bout of insanity when she agreed to wear you, or maybe she's smarter than all of us realize. Everyone's talking about you. Everyone can't stop thinking about you. Just give it a few weeks, and everyone will be wearing nude, ruffly, camel toe jumpsuits without a hint of irony.' Just because Gwyneth got it wrong doesn't mean that blush jumpsuits are out of the question. Lucy Mecklenburgh, Ellen Pompeo and Binky Felstead prove the piece can work and e-tailers Asos, Topshop and Missguided have plenty of stock starting to drop ahead of the warmer months. Simon Glazin (theverysimong.com) added: 'Good old Gwynie, she's got to make headlines somehow, and recently it's been all about her fashion choices and ""conscious uncoupling"" rather than movie roles. 'I actually love seeing her in a jumpsuit, she has the right figure for one, and I do really like this one. It's interesting. 'However, in some lights, the colour washes her out to make it look like a green-screen body suit. And Gwynie love, we don't need camel toe from you!'.

"Councillor Robert Bleakley has been branded the 'most expensive' in Britain after running up a £2,500 phone bill calling sex chatlines . A councillor has been branded the 'most expensive' in Britain after running up a £2,500 phone bill calling sex chatlines and using his mobile to send 'inappropriate' and sexist messages. Robert Bleakley, who has an £11,000 allowance as a representative of Tyldesley in Wigan, Greater Manchester, also used a work computer to watch pornography and did not bother attending a meeting in five months. He was found to have sent a message saying: 'Aren't they f*****g idiots. No wonder women are just cooking and washing material.' In one text, discussing the court case of former politician Chris Huhne and ex-wife Vicky Pryce, he said 'I hope she likes porridge' and that he hoped she would be sexually assaulted in jail. But the Independent councillor has retained his seat and  allowance after turning up at his first meeting in five months. Wigan Council boss Lord Peter Smith told a council meeting at Leigh Town Hall, that Mr Bleakley was the country's 'most expensive councillor at £2,000 an hour', considering the number of meetings he has been to. 'Even a banker would be embarrassed at that rate', he told the council. Mr Bleakley has refused repeated calls for him to quit despite an investigation that found he had also used his work mobile to send explicit text messages. He also deliberately altered an email to try to jeopardise a senior employee's job. The Tyldsley councillor was also banned from speaking to female council staff after the chat line bill was revealed in September. Under council rules, Mr Bleakley could have been removed from the council for non-attendance if he had failed to appear on Wednesday. Police were also called to the meeting after Councillor Bob Brierley refused to leave the chamber. Mr Bleakley also used a work computer to watch pornography and did not bother attending a meeting in five months . Wigan Council boss Lord Peter Smith told a council meeting  that Mr Bleakley was the country's 'most expensive councillor at £2,000 an hour', pictured is town hall chamber . In 2004 Mr Bleakley was disqualified for three years after he verbally abused a female cleaner at Wigan town hall and threatening to get the sack after a minor traffic accident. The Standards Board of England, which oversees councillors' conduct, investigated him and ruled that he was 'aggressive, domineering and intimidating'. He stood as the Lib Dem's parliamentary candidate for Worsley, Greater Manchester, in the 1997 and 2001 general elections. At the time of the 2004 investigation he was leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Wigan Council. He was suspended again for six months in 2010 after being accused of bullying an ex-policewoman who got a job as a community safety officer and branding her 'that woman' during meetings. He had also been investigated by police over accusations of misconduct in a public office but was told he would face no criminal charges.","Councillor Robert Bleakley ran up a £2,500 phone bill calling sex chatlines .
