"Why is everyone so tired all the time? I am one of the country’s leading holistic doctors who specialises in tiredness, and in this ground-breaking series I will show you how to conquer exhaustion by making small adjustments to your lifestyle. In part one  I highlighted the hidden causes of feeling worn out. Here, I present the three-week energy cleanse that will help you feel refreshed . . . CLEANSE YOUR MIND . Takeaways, chocolate and a good night out — I like them as much as the next person and I know how hard they are to give up. Takeaways are not only bad for weight gain, they also contribute to exhaustion . The trouble is that they contribute not only to weight gain, but also to our collective exhaustion. But drastic lifestyle changes can’t happen overnight. So, I’ve devised a three-week cleanse that will wean you off sugar and reset your metabolic balance to help you regain vitality. I’ve taken the best of all the many detox and weight-loss regimes I’ve tried to create the easiest plan to follow: there’s no need to hibernate or give up work and your social life. People often presume a detox is just about what they eat, but it’s also important to cleanse your mind, use natural skin products that contain few or no chemicals and let go of negative emotions to restore your energy. Another good reason to do a detox or cleanse programme at least twice a year is to give the digestive system a rest. It produces as much serotonin, the happy chemical, as our brain, so a sluggish gut can affect our mood, mental well-being and energy levels. This is the way to feel less tired and more energetic, less run-down and more ready to take on the world! Scroll down for video . DUMP PROCESSED FOODS . First, get rid of temptation. Dump all energy-zapping processed foods, potatoes, pasta, bread, cake, desserts, chocolates, crisps, junk foods, fizzy drinks, tea, coffee and milk from your house. Take them to a food bank or give them to a friend or relative. As I explained on Saturday, processed sugar causes spikes in our body’s blood sugar. This causes a temporary surge in energy, but then causes a massive crash that leads us to feel more tired. On the other hand, a diet rich in protein such as meat, fish and eggs excites orexin cells in our brain (a protein-like molecule that regulates mental processes from sleepiness to hunger), boosting our energy levels. Good nutrition is how we absorb sunlight and energise our bodies. The shopping list printed on the right is full of delicious nutritious foods to help us connect with the earth and sunlight and feed our own natural source of energy. You do not have to get everything, but it is an indication for what you can eat during the plan. Shop just once a week, as this cuts down on the temptation to buy unhealthy food. WEEK 1 . The first week is a gentle induction to wean yourself off your old, unhealthy diet. The key is to avoid hunger, as that will make you more likely to give in to unhealthy snacks. An omelette with some meat or vegetarian sausages is a good option for breakfast . Have a breakfast high in protein, as studies have shown this boosts your energy, helps burn fat throughout the day and keeps you feeling fuller for longer. For lunch and dinner, divide an average-sized dinner plate into four quarters and fill it as follows: half with vegetables or salad, a quarter with protein and a quarter with carbohydrates, such as brown rice or couscous or sweet potatoes. The two things people struggle with most is detoxifying from caffeine and sugar. If you’re struggling without coffee (withdrawal normally lasts only two to three days), have a diluted cup made with half your usual amount, and cut it down by a cup a day. Decaff for a few days is also acceptable, but it’s better to go cold turkey. If you’re battling sugar cravings, you can take an amino acid supplement called L-glutamine, available from health shops. You can take one capsule of 500mg up to once an hour, and if taken on an empty stomach it can trick the body into thinking it has sugar in its system. SAMPLE DAILY MENU: . Breakfast . Choose from: . Snack . Choose from: . Lunch . Divide your plate into four and ensure it consists of the following: . Snack . Try to snack on fruit to avoid feeling drowsy during the day time . Dinner . As for lunch, divide your plate into four: . Top tips for eating out . WEEK 2 . The difference this week is that there are two liquid meals a day (juice, smoothie or soup). The best fuel for your body is fruit and vegetables, and juicing them is beneficial because you can drink more than you can eat, and drinking freshly made juice gives your digestive system a rest. Two liquid meals a day are proscribed by Dr Roked . If you juice 80g each of four different fruit or vegetables, that can count as four out of your five a day. And nutrients are absorbed easily. I advise a liquid breakfast and dinner, and your big meal at lunch, so you have a long time for your digestive system to rest and repair overnight. A big meal at lunchtime may seem tricky at work, but most workplaces have a microwave so you can reheat something you’ve prepared. If not, make a large salad with couscous and cold meat (for great recipe ideas, see right). If you are new to liquid meals, you can start with one a day, for breakfast, and then by week three you can build up to the two liquid meals a day if you can manage it. If you really feel you cannot do this, just continue to ‘eat clean’ (ie within the para-meters of the shopping list). Keep well hydrated with herbal tea or water. Any time throughout you feel hungry and you have already drunk a glass of water, you can snack on fruit, vegetables and hummus, seeds or nuts. The amount of carbo-hydrates is reduced this week. The other change is supplements I recommend you take: . So, your programme will look like this: . Breakfast . Snack . Nuts constitute a 'clean' snack in between meals . Lunch . Snack . Dinner . WEEK 3 . By now you will feel amazing and used to the Week 2 eating plan, which you’ll continue this week. It’s time to increase exercise and perform an ‘emotional detox’. Your energy levels should have rocketed, so focus on goals and resolve any issues that might be causing you stress and exacerbating tiredness. The worst thing you can do after the three week plan is splurge on foods like cheese . Reflect on what you want out of life, what you do well and haven’t done so well. Write a plan to achieve any goals in a realistic time frame. The more in tune you become with yourself, the greater the improvement in your health, energy and quality of life. What to do after the THREE-WEEK CLEANSE . The worst thing you can do is go on a massive binge of chocolate, cheese and bread. Most people I know who did ended up suffering with stomach cramps. Take things gradually. Eat two ‘clean’ meals a day (with ingredients from the shopping list), then have small amounts of wheat and dairy if you want for your third meal. Also try to have two completely ‘clean’ days in the week. This gives your body a chance to recover from any excesses. By this time you should be brimming with vitality and enthusiasm for your new lifestyle. THE SPRING CHICKEN STIR-FRY . Serves 1 . 1 broccoli head, cut into florets .

"On September 18, date of the Scottish referendum, something infinitely less seismic is happening that is nonetheless of quiet importance to the parish of British tennis. As Scottish residents cast their votes, the draw for next year's Davis Cup World Group will take place and, for the domestic game and its key player Andy Murray, those two things could be very much interlinked. In response to a question about the Rio Olympics Murray said last week that, in the event of the Yes vote, he 'assumed' he would be playing for Scotland, but a deeper look into the matter shows it may be less straightforward than anyone – including Murray himself – might think. Team GB: Murray has an impressive Davis Cup record for Great Britain, winning 19 of his 21 singles matches . In fact, such are the uncertainties that tennis and other sports are trying to grapple with, that one many eventual scenarios if separation happens could even be that he continues to play for GB in the Davis Cup while turning out for Scotland in Rio. Such is the confusion associated with the increasingly likely outcome of a Yes vote that, in tennis, it has become the subject that nobody wants to talk about. Murray's endorsement may be the glittering prize for either side of the independence argument but, understandably in some ways, he continues to tiptoe around it as the implications are considerable for the reigning Sports Personality of the Year. It is not just him anxious to avoid discussion. Lawn Tennis Association Chief Executive Michael Downey is another to have stayed determinedly uncommitted on the issue. Tennis Scotland are desperate to remain neutral, despite it being massively important to the future of the game north of the border. Broader governing body The International Tennis Federation restricts itself to setting out procedural elements in the event of a Yes vote. Option? Davis Cup captain Leon Smith (right) might not be able to pick Andy Murray for his side in the future . Part of the reason is that there would be no meaningful precedent if Scotland breaks away. According to one official, the only comparable scenario is the recent secession of South Sudan from Sudan (the former Yugoslavia is not an equivalent as, unlike GB, it ceased to exist). While Sudan does have a national tennis association, and competed in the Davis Cup up to 2001, war-torn South Sudan has got infinitely more important things to consider than setting up sporting administrations in the new country. In the UK tennis, a completely integrated sport with no meaningful history of Scotland competing separately, is an interesting study of the difficulties and fears affecting sports north of the border with the possibility of independence, especially those that supply Olympic teams. Scotland is affiliated to the LTA in the same way that, say, Yorkshire or Lancashire are, and Tennis Scotland receives a basic grant of £800,000 annually from the centre plus support for athletes and facilities. The Independence white paper is thin on detail about how and when this kind of money would be replaced. In the seductive Socialist utopia promised by the SNP, in which public spending will go up while things like corporation tax goes down, there are assurances that funding levels for world class sport will survive a schism with the south. Big question: LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey must formulate a plan to find the next Andy Murray . David Marshall, Chief Executive of Tennis Scotland, is among those reluctant to be drawn about the myriad implications, but admitted 'The honest position just now is that there will be a lot of negotiations and decisions in the event of a Yes vote that are impossible to predict, and sport is unlikely to be at the top of the pile. 'There are a lot of unknowns which make it impossible to have a clear idea of what is going to happen. It seems a waste of money to get legal advice about what could be when there are so many unknowns in the situation. It will be different for each sport.' One possible outcome that has been discussed among various Olympic sport is that what may emerge for some is a compromise along the lines of what happens for some sports in Ireland, which have remained united even though Eire is a separate sovereign nation. Gold: The Scot represented Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics, winning a Gold and Silver medal . Some governing bodies are extremely sceptical about whether legal and constitutional issues could be solved in time to allow a separate Scotland to compete at Rio 2016, something that would affect the ex Wimbledon champion among others. Sir Craig Reedie, vice-president of the IOC, is the latest to point this out. A tennis team is logistically far easier to organise than, say, rowing or sailing. Yet an idea of how complex Olympic entry could be in the case of tennis comes with the dry-as-dust response of a spokesperson for the ITF (which runs the sport at the Olympics) to inquiries about how an independent Scotland would proceed after a theoretical split from the LTA. Here goes: 'In order to take part in any ITF team competition a nation has to be a 'Class B' member. A National Tennis Association may apply for membership of the ITF in accordance with the ITF Constitution. In order to apply for membership a National Association must first be a member of the Regional Tennis Association (a low profile body called Tennis Europe in Scotland's case) and in the case of Class B members, a member of the National Olympic Committee or a member state of the United Nations. All memberships must be approved at the ITF Annual General Meeting.' Doubles triumph: Murray teamed up with Laura Robson to win Silver in the mixed doubles at London 2012 . To summarise, that suggests a tricky number of hurdles would need to be cleared in a short period for Olympic participation, at a time when sport would hardly be at the top of a new Scottish government's in-tray with so many more important matters to be sorted out. It is also ITF policy that a player can represent who he or she wants providing they have the requisite passport from that nation – and who gets to hold which passport will be among the thorniest issues to sort out in the event of a Yes vote. You can see why highly focussed athletes do not want to get involved in this kind of minutiae, and also why potential Olympians north of the border might be concerned, given all the possible outcomes and funding implications. It is also easy to understand why Murray, his family and the likes of close friend Sir Chris Hoy are very keen not to become embroiled in a campaign getting more heated and unpleasant the nearer polling day comes. They are part of what might be termed the fearful undeclared. If they were to come out on the No side they will be subject to the vicious attacks of the 'Cybernats' and other pro-independence supporters. If they were to express a view in favour of a Yes vote it would open them up to charges of being anti-English, and doubtless unsettle commercial sponsors as well. This is a particularly sensitive time for the former Wimbledon champion in that regard, as his main apparel contract with adidas is due for renewal on January 1. Negotiations are ongoing with them and others who might wish to sign him with its worth likely to be in the region of £3 million per year, give or take performance clauses. Breakthrough: The Scot's straight sets win over Roger Federer handed Murray the 2012 Olympic Gold medal . The Wimbledon champion has reason to be particularly cautious, given the hysterical reaction to some harmless joshing with his friend Tim Henman about supporting football teams eight years ago that is still held against him by some to this day. The day after his triumph as SW19 last year, when he would have been feeling indestructible, Murray declared that he would have to say something on independence. He has subsequently thought better of it, given the highly emotive reactions the subject draws, but anyone who knows him will be sure that he will have a view, given his intellectual curiosity and fondness for a debate about most things. The nearest he has come to publicly expressing a view was in March last year, when he said in an interview with the Times magazine: 'I don't think you should judge the thing on emotion, but on what is best economically for Scotland. You don't want to come to a snap decision and then see the country go tits up. 'I am proud to be Scottish, but I am also proud to be British. I don't think there is any contradiction in that.' Passionate: David Cameron and Alex Salmond celebrate Andy Murray winning Wimbledon in 2013 . More recently he has pointed out that his view has little relevance because, as a longstanding resident of Surrey, he does not have a vote. But there have been hints of his thinking, such as criticising Alex Salmond for unfurling a Saltire in Wimbledon's Royal Box last year. In the past expressed his admiration for staunch 'No' supporter Gordon Brown, and does not give the impression of being a great enthusiast for independence. His private and professional connections make a nonsense of any suggestions that he is in some way anti-English, and he has never shied from wrapping himself in the Union Jack or made a secret of his pride in representing Great Britain. Patriotic: Murray returned to his hometwon Dunblane after his successes at the London 2012 Olympics . It was notable that after London 2012 he declined to appear at the parade of Scottish Olympians in Glasgow but made his own personal visit to his hometown of Dunblane. Yet it should be stressed that none of the country's first tennis family have publicly made their views clear, including brother Jamie and mother Judy. In the case of the latter, who is Captain of Great Britain's Fed Cup team, a few clues can be gleaned from her highly active Twitter feed. She used to follow the SNP account, although stopped doing that prior to getting the GB job. Last week she retweeted a picture of her holding a Saltire-patterned fan that was accompanied by a (lighthearted) suggestion that she was a fan of independence. Like everything else connected with this very complex issue, it will all most likely become clearer after September 18, although perhaps not for some considerable time, possibly not for years.

"England's future is in a safe pair of hands with Roy Hodgson and the long-term target of winning the 2020 European Championships remains, according to retiring Football Association director of football development Sir Trevor Brooking. Hodgson's faith in youth was rewarded with a 2-0 win away to Switzerland in the opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland, where new Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck scored a brace and Liverpool youngster Raheem Sterling again impressed going forwards. Brooking hopes after the disappointments of dismal summer for the Three Lions at the 2014 World Cup, he will be able to enjoy his retirement by seeing the likes of young English talent such as Arsenal centre-back Calum Chambers, signed from Southampton, Everton duo Ross Barkley and John Stones as well as Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all develop into senior internationals within a competitive side. Safe hands: Roy Hodgson has been backed to lead England to victory at Euro 2020 . Child's play: Calum Chambers is one of several youngsters coming through the ranks with new look England . 'We have got have a better depth at 16 who will break into the first team, and we are starting to see that, but if you are Roy you want them in five or 10 years time to have a better depth of talent and we will get there now because we have made a lot of progress on the structure and have almost just got to let it happen with the people we have appointed in the restructuring over the past couple of years,' Brooking told Press Association Sport at the Houses of Parliament, where he helped mark the sixth millionth place on the FA Skills Programme. 'The group (of young players) interacted really well (during the World Cup), there was good comradery and there is a sort of club atmosphere within the structure, and that came good in Switzerland. 'Roy has known if he encourages that and brings those players through, there is no greater incentive to know there is a senior coach who will give them a chance if they have that promise. 'For me, it is in safe hands. In 2016, we should qualify, but will we be ready to compete? Let's see who is available and has come through. Double up: Welbeck celebrates giving England a winning start in Euro 2016 qualifying against Switzerland . 'We have just got to be patient and over the next 18 months if an opportunity with Roy and Gareth (Southgate) in the under-21s to work together and really start to build that long-term senior squad which is going to be competitive. 'Twenty-twenty is always the one I have thought about - can we do something with that? Especially if we can get the semi-finals and finals at Wembley, which would be awesome because the group that year, from what I have seen in the 17s to 21s, would be very competitive.' Brooking, 65, was joined the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport Sajid Javid and FA General Secretary Alex Horne at a Parliamentary reception to toast the continuing success of the FA Skills Programme, which is funded jointly by the Government through Sport England. Success: Trevor Brooking (L) was instrumental in developing the FA Skills Programme to improve coaching . Former West Ham midfielder Brooking, who won 47 caps for England from 1974 to 1982 - was instrumental in introducing the scheme seven years ago, which identified improving coaching standards for children as key to developing the next generation and maintaining participation. 'We want to make sure all of the youngsters you see here continue to play football into their teens, which is probably the biggest challenge,' he said. 'When you start to play 11 versus 11 that is when youngsters and friends can come brutal, with people telling you that you are hopeless and cannot play. 'So we have to make sure from 5-11, that children have a technical base to play the game longer term and then they will stay in the game.'","Roy Hodgson has been backed to guide England to victory at Euro 2020 .

"People living near  fracking sites are twice as likely to suffer from respiratory and skin problems, experts have warned. A major study has raised health problems connected with hydraulic fracturing, which some people hope will be a major component in the UK’s energy mix of the future. Almost 40 per cent of people living less than two thirds of a mile (1km) from a natural gas well reported upper respiratory symptoms, compared to 18 per cent of people living over 1.5 miles (2km) away. Scroll down for video . People living near natural gas wells used in hydraulic fracturing – or fracking – are twice as likely to suffer from respiratory and skin problems, experts warn. Many people are opposed to the practice (stock image) which is big business in the US - and is set to be a major industry in the UK . Little is known about the environmental and public health impact of certain natural gas extraction techniques - including fracking - that occurs near residential areas in the US. Yale University researchers surveyed 492 people in 180 households with ground-fed water wells in southwestern Pennsylvania, where natural gas extraction activity is significant. There are 624 active natural gas wells in the survey area, 95 per cent of which produce gas via fracking, according to the study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. The experts compared the proximity of gas wells to the frequency of self-reported skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological symptoms over the past year. They found that the prevalence of skin and respiratory conditions were higher among residents living closer to natural gas wells, but they didn't find a significant increase in grouped neurological, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal symptoms among those living in homes closer to natural gas wells. Almost 40 per cent of people living less than two thirds of a mile (1km) from a natural gas well (stock image) reported upper respiratory symptoms, compared to 18 per cent of people living over one-and-a-half miles (2km) away, according to the bleak Yale University report . The study did not look at the likely cause of the problem, but one expert told MailOnline that the problem may lie in the construction of the wells, as they are not strictly regulated in the US. ‘Our study suggests that natural gas drilling may increase the risk of health symptoms in people living near the wells,’ said the study’s senior author Meredith Stowe, associate research scientist at the Yale Occupational and Environmental Medicine Program. ‘We believe our findings support the need for further research into the health and environmental implications of this form of natural gas extraction.’ Dr Peter Rabinowitz, who is now at the University of Washington’s School of Public Health, said: ‘The effect we found persisted in the analyses, even after adjusting for gender, age, educational level, smoking, and awareness of environmental risk factors.’ The experts compared the proximity of gas wells to the frequency of self-reported skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological symptoms over the past year. They found that the prevalence of skin and respiratory conditions (illustrated) were higher among residents living closer to natural gas wells . A health watchdog said last Noevmber that while fracking is unlikely to cause cancer,more research is needed into its long-term effects. Public Health England (PHE) criticised a U.S. study, which claimed that residents living within half a mile of a site were slightly more likely to get cancer. Scientists in Colorado used a computer model to predict that there would be an extra ten cases of cancer for those living within half a mile radius of a fracking drilling well. The PHE dismissed the idea that people living near the sites will develop breathing difficulties and other medical problems, saying they ‘know enough’ to allay fears for now - although they admitted that very little research has been carried out into potential harms of the process. Dr John Harrison, director of PHE’s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, insisted that as long as fracking was carried out properly, the potential risks to public health would be ‘low’. He said: ‘The currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to emissions that are associated with shale gas extraction process are low if the operations are properly run and regulated.’ However he conceded that research into the long-term health implications had been ‘limited’ – and said they would need to continue to monitor evidence as it emerged. While the study makes for bleak reading, Ken Cronin, CEO of United Kingdom Onshore Oil and Gas (UKOOG) told MailOnline that if fracking goes ahead on a large scale in the UK, it would be highly unlikely that people living near sites would suffer respiratory and skin conditions linked to the industry. ‘I wouldn’t expect to see that in the UK,’ he said. Mr Cronin explained there are three main risks when it comes to fracking: chemicals spilling where they are stored on the surface and liquid pumped up the vertical pipe and lateral pipe further down, passing through into the aquifer - an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock. However, he claims there are ‘gold standard’ regulations in place to stop this from happening that are much stricter than those in place in the US. 'The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) oversees the construction of wells and they have the strictest regulations in the world. All the designs have to be approved by the HSE then an independent well examiner,' he said. Mr Cronin explained that there three layers of casing around the pipes used for fracking that are tested multiple times and send continuous streams of data proving their integrity to the HSE, unlike in the US where some regulations are 'almost non-existent'. Scientists have previously proved that it is impossible for water and chemicals used to frack some 948ft (300 metres) below ground level to travel upwards into the aquifer - where it could mix with drinking water, while studies by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering, among others, have said that with proper regulation, there is little risk of contamination to drinking water. Stuart Haszeldine, Professor of Carbon Capture and Storage at the University of Edinburgh, told MailOnline: ‘This study shows an unproven possibility that shale boreholes could produce self-reported health problems. ‘With a small sample number of people and long term consumption of groundwater from local wells, it's possible that these observed correlations could have other causes, such as prior contamination of groundwater. Nevertheless, it's an observation of poor health effects which needs to be checked with a larger and more systematic investigation.’ He said that a recent report that he was involved in noted emerging evidence on health effects, but such evidence lacked a ‘good measure of what health was like before shale drilling operations started. ‘In Britain, we should be able to get some measure of that. But, much more investigation of the health information from the US would be very sensible before starting campaigns of similar drilling here. Shale gas has been hailed a possible ingredient in the UK's future energy mix (a map of reserves is pictured), but new health scares could put a spanner in the works - at least in terms of public perception .","Study by Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, warns of health risks .

"Floyd Mayweather said he's ready for whatever kind of brawl Marcos Maidana has waiting at the MGM Grand on September 13 as he worked out in front of the world's media in his Las Vegas gym. The only thing separating the 11-time world champion and the Argentine's last encounter in May from a street fight was the ropes, but Mayweather's class came through as he took a points decision and extended his career record to 46-0. A cut from a Maidana headbutt in the fourth round and a number of questionable blows from the underdog, a former world champ in his own right, didn't put Mayweather off his game and the richest sportsman on the planet is expecting more of the same when they meet again.

He then had a stab at 50 Cent's own career: 'Does he still make music? I ain't heard him in a while.' Mayweather also has an eye on what could be the richest fights in boxing history with negotiations at an advanced stage for two 2015 clashes with Manny Pacquiao, finally bringing together the world's two best pound-for-pound fighters after years of near misses. Sportsmail has reported the PacMan's promoter Bob Arum is confident the pair will meet with the added insentive of a double-your-money re-match a few months after the first encounter.

"This isn't easy. Normally picking a united Merseyside team is tough because so many players have compelling claims for inclusion. Ahead of the 223rd derby, though, that certainly isn't the case. With Brendan Rodgers admitting Liverpool's play has been 'a little bit broken' and Roberto Martinez accepting Everton's defending has been 'poor' both managers have issues to address ahead of the crucial game. It also means Sportsmail has a job trying to come up with the best combined 11 from the players who are expected to be available on Saturday – you will not see those in the treatment room figuring below – but it won't stop us. So here we go. Our formation is 4-2-3-1... Everton shot-stopper Tim Howard makes a flying save during their Europa League clash against Wolfsburg . Goalkeeper - Tim Howard . This has not been the American's finest week, with errors against Crystal Palace and Swansea, but eight days ago he was outstanding in the Europa League win over Wolfsburg and is generally in better form than Simon Mignolet, who has looked short of confidence too often of late. Republic of Ireland international Seamus Coleman has proved one of the signings of recent years for Everton, offering an oustanding threat going forward and helping his side out defensively whenever he is needed . Right-back - Seamus Coleman . Martinez said he will give the Republic of Ireland international every chance to prove he is able to play and his faith is unlikely to be misplaced. Coleman offers a persistent outlet down the flank and defends as though his life depends on it. He gives more going forward than Liverpool's Javier Manquillo. Glen Johnson's injury means he can't be considered. John Stones, left, has been thrown in at the deep end for club and country but has not looked fazed for either . Central defenders - John Stones and Martin Skrtel . An unexpected pairing, perhaps, but valid reasons for their selection. Stones has caught the eye playing for England and would not be flustered by the big game atmosphere. Skrtel, meanwhile, remains Liverpool's best central defender and his importance to the team has been shown in his absence. He also provides a goal threat at set pieces. Others who play in this position at Anfield and Goodison simply haven't been good enough so far. Slovakia captain Martin Skrtel is Liverpool's best option at centre-back and also chips in with a few goals . Left-back - Leighton Baines . Alberto Moreno would undoubtedly have his backers but you know what you are getting with Baines; reliability at the back and going forward, terrific dead ball delivery and experience. Moreno is still adjusting to English football and doesn't defend as well as Baines yet. Leighton Baines, left, is the obvious choice at left-back in our Merseyside XI after excelling for Roberto Martinez's side since joining the club from Wigan for a fee of £5million in the summer of 2007 . Holding midfield - James McCarthy and Steven Gerrard . McCarthy is a player that every team needs, a 7 out of 10 performance, almost every week and he has been one of Everton's top performers so far. The questions, here, will come over Gerrard, whom Rodgers staunchly defended on Monday. Some will ask why he gets in, so here are the reasons: if, say, you want a last minute penalty converting or a pass delivering at the right moment, Gerrard remains the man to do it. James McCarthy, right, shows his mettle during a midfield battle with Tottenham's Aaron Lennon last year . Despite coming under fire recently Steven Gerrard remains the man Liverpool will turn to in a time of need . Right midfield - Jordan Henderson . One of the first names on this teamsheet. Growing in stature with each week, a crucial cog in the engine room and the England international's progress is showing no signs of stopping. He is versatile, too, and can operate in other roles if required. The versatile Jordan Henderson, centre, has established himself as a key part of Brendan Rodgers's midfield . Attacking midfield - Steven Naismith . The most improved player at Goodison Park in the last 12 months, Everton are better when he is in the team. Works relentlessly, uses the ball intelligently and has the knack of popping up in the right areas at the right moment to score goals. Everton may have started the campaign slowly but that is not something you could level at him. Scotland attacker Steven Naismith has started the season superbly with three goals in the Premier League . Left midfield - Kevin Mirallas . When this Belgium international gets in the mood, he is exciting to watch, his speed and skill can befuddle defenders. In his first Merseyside derby, he terrorised Liverpool for 45 minutes until he was the victim of reckless tackle from Luis Suarez. Good from set pieces and scores goals, doesn't appear to showing any lingering fatigue from his World Cup exertions. Kevin Mirallas has been a thorn in Liverpool's side when he has played in Merseyside derbies in recent years . Centre-forward - Raheem Sterling . The most unusual pick? You may have anticipated Sterling getting into this team but not as a centre forward. Needs must, however, and this why he would fulfil the role. For starters, Daniel Sturridge may not be fit after his thigh problem. Secondly, Mario Balotelli has not been good enough, ditto Fabio Borini. Then, with Everton, Romelu Lukaku has not yet done enough, while Samuel Eto'o has had fitness problems. That is why Sterling, with his explosive pace, dazzling skill and three goals to his name already, has to lead this line. It might be an unorthodox position but it is one in which he has the tools to thrive. Like our MailOnline Sport Facebook page.

"The haunting never-seen-before images of bullet holes and a broken toilet lid in the bathroom of the home previously owned by Oscar Pistorius are a chilling reminder of where the Paralympian shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp 18 months ago. The interior shots show the eerily empty rooms in the upmarket house in Pretoria that has laid vacant since that fatal night in the upstairs bathroom during the early hours of Valentine’s Day last year when the Paralympian shot at Miss Steenkamp through a locked toilet door saying he believed she was an intruder. A broken window and an abandoned murky green swimming pool also vividly illustrates the desolate but once luxurious property that Pistorius and Steenkamp used to call home in the Silver Woods Estate. The athlete has never returned to the house and has lived with his uncle ever since while he awaits for his fate to be handed down on his murder trial next month. The Daily Mail reported just four weeks ago that the villa in a gated community finally sold for 4.5million South African rand at the beginning of this month after being on the market since March – about the equivalent of $170,000 less than the asking price. It was confirmed that the 27-year-old, who is still on trial for murder, needed to sell the property to raise money for his legal bills, a total of at least $8,000 per day. Scroll down for video .

The toilet (left) pictured recently with the bullet holes above amd the gruesome scene of the crime with the bloody toilet in the background (right) The buyer Louwtjie Louwrens, plans to retire to the property with his family. 'It is in a safe area and everyone I dealt with was very professional, ' he told the Times Live in South Africa. 'It stood empty for more than a year and there is some water damage, so we would first have to repair it.' It is thought that the house remained sealed since it was handed back by police over a year ago. Estate agent Ansie Louw, who was handling the sale said selling the property was an unusual process due to the situation. 'We were not allowed to take photos or put it onto our website. If they do open it they attract lots of people just interested in the case and it will be chaos,’ she said. 'It is not normal circumstances. It is not a normal process. But you know what some people say it doesn't bother them.' Ms Louw also explained that there has been a lot of interest in the home since it went up for sale in March. The green swimming pool also vividly illustrates the desolate but once luxurious property that Pistorius and Steenkamp lived in until 18 months ago . The interior shots show the eerily empty rooms in the upmarket house in Pretoria that has laid vacant for 18 months . The home inally sold for 4.5million South African rand at the beginning of this month after being on the market since March . Pistorius valued the house at five million rand during his bail application in February last year. At the time he also owned two other houses with a combined value of 1.5 million rand in Pretoria and a vacant plot worth 1.6 million rand in Cape Town. All his properties together were worth 8.3 million rand, the sporting hero told the court. Since the shooting he has lost many of the endorsement deals that earned him about $510,000 a year. The athlete has been paying his own legal fees since the shooting, according to a statement released by his lawyers earlier this year. The costs are said to include at least three full-time lawyers in court, ballistics and forensics experts as well as an American crime scene reconstruction company. Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has not given up hope of Daniel Sturridge playing some part in the Merseyside derby. The England striker has been sorely missed by the Reds since sustaining a thigh injury on international duty earlier this month but is inching ever closer to a comeback. In his absence Rodgers' side have lost to Aston Villa and West Ham, snuck a last-gasp win over Ludogorets in the Champions League and required penalties to see off Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup. VIDEO Scroll down to watch both Suarez goals for Barca B . Brendan Rodgers is holding out hope for the return of Daniel Sturridge in the Merseyside derby . Sturridge walks on the pitch ahead of Liverpool's match against Aston Villa at Anfield . They would dearly love to unleash the 25-year-old against their neighbours at Anfield but although Rodgers was upbeat about his recovery, an appearance this weekend appears to be based on hope as much as expectation. 'We'll be very happy to have him back and we hope that can be this weekend,' said the Northern Irishman. 'We've got a number of injuries that we're going to give every chance to. 'He (Sturridge) is a player who's out on the field working. Him and a number of others we'll just assess nearer the time. But if he doesn't make it he won't be far off after that. 'He's someone that responds well to treatment. Obviously it's gone well but there are still a couple of days to go before the game. The most important thing is he's near to fitness. Sturridge is no chance of being match fit after he was injured on duty for England, but Rodgers says he is a chance to come off the bench against neighbouring Premier League rivals Everton . 'He certainly won't be match-fit, he hasn't played for a few weeks, but it'll be great to have him back because he's a wonderful player for us. 'He's a great reference for our team at the top of the field, his pace and movement and quality, which we saw the last time he played against Tottenham.'

"CLICK HERE to see how Sportsmail reporters see United lining up this season . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes manager Louis van Gaal's greatest challenge is accommodating the attacking options he now has at his disposal. However, he admits the Dutchman also has to sort out the Red Devils' suspect defence if they are to secure a return to the Champions League this season. The £59.7million arrival of Argentina winger Angel di Maria and on-loan Colombia striker Radamel Falcao means Van Gaal now has to fit them into a team which also has England and Holland captains Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, Spain international Juan Mata and precocious teenager Adnan Januzaj. Challenge: Louis van Gaal must accomodate  (L-R) Angel di Maria, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney . Selection dilema: Van Gaal's biggest problem will be fitting all his forwards into a team at Old Trafford . Falcao could make his debut at home to QPR on Sunday but it remains to be seen how the United boss will set up his side. Asked if the biggest problem is fitting everyone into a starting XI, Scholes told MUTV: 'It is yeah, but it's not a bad problem to have. 'Fans have been moaning about the type of players that were at the club and now you can't do that. 'I think Ed Woodward (executive vice-chairman) has done his job brilliantly during this transfer window with some great signings. Bringing up the rear: Former United midfielder Paul Scholes also thinks that United's defence must improve . 'The calibre of player we have brought in is top quality, like Di Maria and Falcao. 'These are proper players. We just have to find a way of getting them all in the same team, playing well and scoring goals - which we have struggled to do a little bit. 'Now it is over to the manager to sort everything out and make us a good team again. 'Defensively we haven't been great either so he needs to sort that out. Then, I'm sure we can be vying for Champions League places.' Di Maria has proven his versatility in a number of positions for club and country but Scholes feels he has to become the go-to winger for his new side. Sacrificed? Juan Mata (R) is widely expected to make way for United's new attacking signings . 'I would like to see Di Maria play wide,' Scholes added. 'Whether van Gaal is going to play with wide players I'm not too sure, but we saw the other night that he was devastating for Argentina against Germany in wide areas. 'Whether it is the right or left-hand side, his pace is frightening. 'He can go past players and score goals. That is something we have been missing. 'I am sure he can play in the central areas as well, but if I was picking him then it would be in the wide areas.' Ready: Falcao (R)  appeared in Colombia's friendly against Brazil ahead of his expected debut against QPR . Scholes is optimistic United will see the best of Falcao again after his recovery from anterior knee ligament surgery. 'Falcao's goalscoring record is brilliant from when he has been at Porto and Atletico Madrid,' said the midfielder. 'The goals he has scored have been important, then there is the movement he brings and his experience as well at 28 years of age. 'You just hope his knee is right, I think that will be the main problem but once he gets going and Di Maria can start creating chances for him then I'm sure we will start scoring goals.'

Defensively he is very clever and obviously he’s not been at Tottenham for 10 years for no reason. ‘I was surprised Spurs let him go to be honest, because even last season he played near enough every game for them. It was a bit of a surprise because he’s only 30 so hopefully we can get three or four good years from him. ‘Spurs’ loss is our gain. They’ve obviously got a new manager [Mauricio Pochettino] who is trying to do things his own way and wants his own players which is fair enough, but hopefully we can benefit from that with the signing of Daws.’ Quality: Michael Dawson is unveiled following his £3.5 million move from White Hart Lane . Incoming: Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez is expected to arrive from Palermo . The midfielder — a £5.25m arrival last summer — added: ‘I saw potential in the squad last year which made me sign and we had a good season, which is attracting players like Dawson and Abel Hernandez [the Uruguay striker on the verge of a £10m move from Palermo]. ‘The season we had last year is helping bring quality players like that and long may it continue. We’ve made a statement with these signings.’ Hull are in their second season in the top flight under the canny guidance of Steve Bruce. They were FA Cup finalists in May but failed to progress to the Europa League group stage after exiting on away goals to Belgian side Sporting Lokeren on Thursday. ‘The lads are devastated,’ Huddlestone admitted. ‘We obviously won the game but away goals are cruel. Seeing the Europa League draw was when it fully sunk in. Three is the magic number: Jake Livermore (R) completes Hull City's collection of former Tottenham stars . ‘But we need to be straight back on it. As devastating as Thursday night was, having a game two or three days later is the perfect way to bounce back and get it out of your system.’ It’s not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… There’s £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager .

"Rock-solid Chelsea have picked up where they left off last season and have now kept eight clean sheets in their past nine home League games. In a sterile first half, the loudest cheer was for the homecoming hero warming up. Didier Drogba had only to emerge from the technical area to galvanise Stamford Bridge. Frankly, in a poor opening 45 minutes, there was precious little else about which to get excited. When Drogba finally received the call to make his first appearance at Stamford Bridge since leaving in 2012 — by which time Chelsea were 2-0 up — the excitement was near feverish. Even Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich wore a broad smile and applauded enthusiastically. Shooting boots: Diego Costa nets his first goal in as many games in a Chelsea shirt to put his side ahead . Coming good: Jose Mourinho had to have some sharp words with his striker in the first half, but it paid off . However, the question remains whether the return of Drogba at 36 years of age amounts to a glorified testimonial year or a viable alternative for manager Jose Mourinho. It is probably a bit of both. That said, given the paucity of world-class strikers, and the reality that a really good player will not come to sit on the bench, then there is some sense behind the decision. Drogba’s physicality and know-how are bound to carry Chelsea through a few tricky moments and in the first half against Leicester he may well have led the line better than Diego Costa. Mourinho has warm words for the Brazilian-born Costa, who speaks no English but seems to communicate with everyone just by charisma. He has also scored two goals in as many games, when it took Fernando Torres 24 to reach that total. Costa also felt the sharp end of Mourinho’s tongue during the first half, presumably for not offering enough movement. Drogba might have handled a side like Leicester better, but the trouble is it would be a risk to start with the Ivorian knowing that he probably only has an hour of good football in him. That means Chelsea are likely to resist any offer for Torres, at least until they have a replacement. Jumping for Joy: Costa's goal eased the tension around Stamford Bridge after a poor first half . Return of the king: Didier Drogba was given a hero's welcome when he came on with the game won . Mourinho is genuine when he says he needs his No 3 striker — though his failure to even win a place on the bench indicates just where he ranks. Chelsea look to have finally solved their striker problem, with Diego Costa netting twice already this season and 36-year-old Didier Drogba providing solid back-up. Fernando Torres, though, who didn’t make the squad against Leicester, will not be allowed to leave the club, despite being linked with a move to Italy. ‘I want three strikers in the team,’ manager Jose Mourinho said. ‘I cannot do a season without three strikers. He (Torres) will play and score goals. He is a fantastic guy, a fantastic professional, so there is no problem.’ Drogba’s role will surely be principally as a substitute but any injury to Costa would surely mean Torres would start, especially when the two-games-a-week schedule kicks in. ‘This (situation) is over next week,’ Mourinho said. ‘After that we have Capital One Cup and Champions League. Everything is much easier then because all will be playing.’ The striking options Chelsea have at their disposal this season do seem a considerable step up from what they had last term. Ultimately though, it stills looks short of the talent champions Manchester City can draw upon — assuming they all stay fit, of course. Long term, even the euphoria surrounding Drogba’s return will not help Chelsea bridge that gap. Bench warmer: Torres didn't even make the squad against Leicester and is Mourinho's third choice striker .","Costa scores second goal in two games to secure three points .

"Oscar Pistorius thanked his family and those who have 'picked me up through everything' after the judge retired to consider her verdict in his murder trial. Both teams of lawyers wrapped up their cases today at the end of a months-long case that has seen Pistorius vomit, retch and break down in tears on several occasions in court. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel ended proceedings by making a final plea for the South African athlete to 'face the consequences' of shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Judge Thokozile Masipa, only the second black woman to be appointed a high court judge in post-apartheid South Africa, will now analyse more than 4,000 pages of evidence before delivering her verdict on September 11.

Earlier, . as his lawyers prepared for their final chance to prove his innocence, . the double-amputee was given a warm embrace from his estranged father, . Henke, in court. The pair . have barely seen each other over the last year after Pistorius distanced . himself from inflammatory comments his father made after his son was . charged with murder. Henke . was accused of racism by South Africa's governing black ANC after he . appeared to blame high levels of violent crime against whites on the . party. Double amputee . Pistorius, 27, once a national icon for reaching the pinnacle of sport, . is accused of murdering Steenkamp, a law graduate and model, at his home . in Pretoria on St Valentine's Day last year. Loving embrace: Oscar Pistorius gets a hug from his estranged father Henke ahead of today's hearing .

Icy: Pistorius looks straight at Reeva Steenkamp's parents June and Barry as he enters court . Anxious: Reeva Steenkamp's parents June and Barry wait to hear more details of their daughter's death . The . defence says Pistorius, nicknamed the Blade Runner after his . carbon-fibre prosthetic running legs, shot Miss Steenkamp through a . locked toilet door in self-defence, believing she was an intruder. Mr . Nel has spent the trial, which began in March, portraying Pistorius as a . gun-obsessed hothead who deliberately shot Steenkamp, 29, four times as . she was taking refuge in the toilet after an argument. Cutting through months of complex evidence and testimony, Mr Nel ended proceedings by returning to his core argument. 'He knew there was a human being in the toilet. That's his evidence,' Mr Nel told the judge. 'His . intention was to kill a human being. He's fired indiscriminately into . that toilet. Then m'lady, he is guilty of murder. There must be . consequences.' Defence . lawyer Barry Roux said during his own wrapping-up that psychological . evidence had proven the track star had a heightened fight response . because of his disability and was in a terrified and vulnerable state . when he shot Steenkamp. Re-enactment: Defence lawyer Barry Roux gives his closing arguments in the murder trial . Relaxed: The Paralympian take a sip of water in the dock before the start of the hearing . 'You're standing at that door. You're vulnerable. You're anxious. You're trained as an athlete to react. 'Take . all those factors into account,' Roux said, adding that Pistorius had . felt exposed because he was standing on the stumps of his legs. 'He stands with his finger on the trigger, ready to fire when ready. 'In some instances a person will fire reflexively,' he added. 'That is your primal instinct.' Roux . also argued that prosecutors had only called witnesses who supported . their argument and not other key people, including police officers, who . he said would have undermined their case. On . Thursday, Mr Nel said Pistorius had told 'a snowball of lies' and had . called for the track star to be convicted of intentional murder, a crime . that could land him with a life sentence. A potential lesser charge of culpable homicide - comparable to manslaughter - could carry a sentence of about 15 years. Pistorius . also faces three separate charges, including two counts of discharging . firearms in public and possession of illegal ammunition, all of which he . denies. Tense: Oscar Pistorius arrives at court as his lawyers prepare to finish their closing argument in his trial . Last chance: Defence lawyer Barry Roux arrives for the closing arguments of the athlete's murder trial . To arrive at a . verdict, Masipa and her two assistants will have to weigh up the . credibility of testimony on both sides, including that of Pistorius, who . endured more than a week of torrid cross-examination during which he . broke down repeatedly. In the absence of a jury, experts say the crux of the case is whether Masipa accepts or rejects his version of events. Mr . Nel has called for Pistorius's evidence to be thrown out because it was . 'devoid of any truth' and the athlete contradicted himself when he said . during cross-examination that he fired both accidentally and . deliberately. Mr Roux said . the trial should only ever have been on the charge of culpable homicide, . rather than murder, because he said Pistorius had clearly shot . Steenkamp by mistake. 'An inspiration': A banner supporting the athlete is unfurled outside the high court in Pretoria . Mr Nel . and Mr Roux have focused much of their closing arguments on evidence . from witnesses who say they heard a woman scream before a volley of . shots, supporting the prosecution's position that the couple had an . argument before Steenkamp was killed. Mr . Roux went through the early morning of the shooting minute-by-minute . during his wrapping-up, arguing that the witnesses were confused and . contradictory about the sounds they heard. He . also spent time analysing photos he said proved the police had moved . items in the couple's bedroom, countering a key claim by Nel that images . of the room proved that Pistorius' version of the events was . impossible. The courtroom . duelling between Mr Nel and Mr Roux, both dynamic advocates with . contrasting styles, has added to the drama in a trial that has . captivated audiences around the world. Mr . Nel, known as 'The Pitbull' because of his fierce cross-examination . style and penchant for the dramatic, has been the perfect foil to Mr . Roux, whose meticulous eye for detail has put the squeeze on even the . most composed prosecution witnesses. The fathers of both Pistorius and Steenkamp were in court for the first time this week. The track star's aunt embraced Steenkamp's father before the trial resumed on Friday. Oscar Pistorius's older brother Carl remains on a ventilator after a car crash in South Africa last week. The . Pistorius family said in a statement that Carl Pistorius was still . intensive care in the capital Pretoria 'due to the serious nature of the . injuries sustained in the accident'.

"Jose Mourinho feels Chelsea have plenty of room for improvement despite making a perfect start to the new Barclays Premier League season - but he is happy to take things 'step by step'. The Blues needed more than an hour to finally break down the resistance of a well-organised Leicester side, looking to make their own statement after a decade out of the top flight. Mourinho had slammed his team as 'lazy' in a first half which saw them create few chances, before they rallied, but only after Foxes striker David Nugent had seen a one-on-one chance saved by goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, again picked ahead of Petr Cech. Scroll down for videos... Must do better: Manager Jose Mourinho insists that Chelsea can still improve in the Premier League . Wake up! The Chelsea manager branded some of his players 'lazy' during the first-half at Stamford Bridge . The Chelsea boss was pleased with the response, Oscar hitting the post and £32million striker Diego Costa then scoring his second goal in as many games with a smart close-range finish just after the hour. Eden Hazard then stroked in a second on 77 minutes which killed off any hope of a comeback by last season's Sky Bet Championship winners. Mourinho had opted to switch to afternoon training sessions this week in a bid to avert any lethargy from the traditional August sunshine, which failed to materialise. The Portuguese coach feels things are moving in the right direction and Chelsea can soon find another level when the fixtures start to come thick and fast once the Capital One Cup and Champions League campaigns begin. On target again: New signing Diego Costa scored his second goal in as many games . Outfoxed: Eden Hazard celebrates after scoring Chelsea's second goal in their 2-0 defeat of Leicester . 'I know that we need to work and improve, especially on the intensity of our game, which I want to be higher defensively,' said Mourinho. 'But at the same time I know pre-season was not perfect and we need to go step by step. 'For example, Willian played a fantastic 20 minutes, showing he is coming along, but if I play him from the beginning, his answer would not be the same, also with Ramires. 'I know some players are at the top of their form, like (Branislav) Ivanovic, you can see clearly he is completely ready, and by the other way you can see some players are still up and down, have moments where they lose intensity and creativity. 'But I think this is the beginning of the season, we go step by step.' Step by step: Players like Willian are yet to reach full fitness after a pre-season disrupted by the World Cup . Leicester's fate is unlikely to be sealed by results at the title contenders, rather what they are able to do against the sides set to contest the battles in the other half of the table. The Foxes will get some respite when they host Shrewsbury in their midweek cup tie, before preparing for the visit of Arsenal next Sunday. Manager Nigel Pearson - whose side drew 2-2 with Everton on the opening day and host Manchester United soon after the international break - accepts Leicester have little time to get used to their new surroundings. 'It was always going to be the key factor, whether we could (learn),' said Pearson. 'We don't set standards low, it is whether you are able to adapt quick enough. 'Our performances have suggested we are a very capable side with some very good individual players, but our main strength is, as it was last season, our collective spirit and belief. 'The game at Chelsea shows what a difficult league this is to operate in, but I have every confidence in my players, I have no doubts about that.' Hit the ground running: Defender Branislav Ivanovic set up the opening goal for Diego Costa . Pearson admits Leicester could do with a couple of extra bodies to improve his options. Midfielder Dean Hammond was forced off at Chelsea after suffering severe cramp while Danny Drinkwater and Matty James are still not yet match fit. A potential deal to bring in Argentina midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, a free agent after leaving Inter Milan, has stalled, but the Foxes will continue to work right up to the closure of the window on September 1. 'It has been a very problematical window for us, but we have tried to get deals done and we will endeavour to add to the squad,' Pearson added.

"After finding the net twice in his first two matches for Chelsea, perhaps Diego Costa was checking that his goal bonus had been paid in.

Costa, signed from Atletico Madrid, opened his account at Burnley in Monday's 3-1 win, and his manager Jose Mourinho has been impressed by the speed of the Brazil-born forward's transition. 'I got the feeling in pre-season that his adaptation would not be a big deal, he is an easy guy,' said Mourinho. 'His style of play has adapted to our needs, so it has not been a problem.' Impressed: Jose Mourinho has been pleased with the way Costa has adapted to English football . But Mourinho was not impressed with his side's slow start to the match. He said: 'I prefer to train in the morning, but this week I trained in the afternoon because this is not the best weather to play football, you get lazy. 'This weather pushes players to be a bit lazy, to lose a bit of tension, a bit of sharpness in your body, after that you pass slow, you do not react to the second balls, the time goes on and on, then when you wake up, it is half-time.

'But they improved in the second half and they won, which is the most important thing. 'At half-time, we had to be a bit emotional with them.

"Sergio Aguero's return to full fitness looked to have suffered a setback on Thursday when he stayed down following an Aleksandar Kolarov tackle during a Manchester City training session. The Argentinean striker has only started 73 games in three years at  City, after suffering injuries in every season he has been at the club. He appeared to be getting back to full fitness with two goals in the first two games of this campaign, so boss Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping the knock turns out be nothing serious. Crunch: Sergio Aguero is taken out by Aleksandar Kolarov in Manchester City's  training session on Thursday . Staying down: Aguero lay on the ground following the tackle by Serbian left-back Kolarov . Concern: Kolarov and James Milner look down at their stricken team-mate after the tackle . It took the forward just 23 seconds to score against Liverpool on Monday after coming on as a substitute, in a game in which understudy Stevan Jovetic scored twice. The form of Jovetic and Edin Dzeko would soften the blow of an injury to Aguero, but it would still be  frustrating after the niggles the Argentinean has had with since joining in 2011.

"The only journalist to have spent time with Oscar Pistorius during his murder trial is convinced the St Valentine's Day shooting was a 'tragic accident'. Investigative reporter Mark Williams-Thomas said he believes the athlete's account that he shot Reeva Steenkamp after mistaking her for a burglar. His comments come as Pistorius prepares to return to court tomorrow for the verdict in his murder trial that captivated and divided a global audience for the last six months. Scroll down for video . 'Tragic accident': Reporter Mark Williams-Thomas (left) believes Oscar Pistorius (picture, left, at his murder trial) is innocent of charges that he deliberately killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year . Speaking to ITV's This Morning from Pretoria in South Africa, Mr Williams-Thomas said: '[Pistorius] is obviously devastated. 'I think it’s very important to set out that Oscar admits to having shot - and obviously as a result of that - Reeva died. 'But he’s also very clear in that it was a very tragic accident, that he didn’t intend to, and he believed someone was in the house. 'And having spent time with him and spoken to him in real detail, and not just him but his family, and the evidence and the more I talk to him, I do believe that also it is a tragic accident.' Prosecutors argue that Pistorius deliberately killed the law graduate by firing four rounds from a 9mm pistol through a closed toilet door in a fit of rage. Defence lawyers, however, said there are 'two Oscars' - a world-class athlete and a highly vulnerable individual with a serious disability who acted out of fear, not anger, when he fired the fatal shots thinking she was a dangerous intruder. 'Broken man': Pistorius vomits in the dock during his murder trial after seeing horrific pictures of Reeva Steenkamp's injuries . When asked by This Morning host . Phillip Schofield whether he felt comfortable being in the company of a . man that could be convicted as a murderer, Mr Williams-Thomas replied: . 'Absolutely.' He added: 'I . feel comfortable talking to anybody. I’ve talked to Oscar, I’ve been . seeing him obviously away from everybody else and I think the big . difference is that everybody else is judging on seeing him in a court . fashion and not away from that and in his normal family environment. 'I’ve . been the only person in the world that's been able to do that... so . I’ve seen him in a very different environment. And he is a broken man.' If . the judge decides Pistorius deliberately murdered Miss Steenkamp, he . could face a life sentence, which in South Africa means 25 years in . jail. Rallying to his defence: Mr Williams-Thomas said he believes the athlete's account that he shot Reeva Steenkamp (pictured) after mistaking her for a burglar late at night . But even if that is her verdict, it is not the end of the case. There will be arguments before sentence is handed down and, most likely, an appeal to a higher court. If Pistorius is acquitted of murder he can still be convicted on an alternative charge of culpable homicide, which could also carry a prison sentence. But Mr Williams-Thomas said: '[Pistorius] made it very clear to me that actually whatever the punishment it comes down to tomorrow, that nothing will bring Reeva back, he still loves her dearly... and he wishes obviously that circumstances were different. 'He said that no punishment will be anywhere near the punishment that he has for himself because he's lost someone he was in love with. 'He was only going out with her for three months but they were still very much in a courting relationship.' Pistorius denies all the charges, including three other firearm-related counts.","Mark Williams-Thomas believes athlete shot Reeva Steenkamp by mistake .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League and Football League this weekend, including why Diego Costa is the perfect striker for Chelsea... 1) Diego Costa’s shuffle of feet and close range shot against Leicester was his second close range finish in two Premier League games so far. That’s good news for Chelsea fans after their struggles to find a consistent forward last season, but even better is that there’s more to the £30million new recruit than just a bit of goal poaching. Of the 27 he hit for Atletico Madrid in last season’s La Liga, only nine were from ten yards or less. Goalscorer: Diego Costa celebrates opening the scoring for Chelsea in their 2-0 win over Leicester . 2) QPR’s defensive system relies on a midfield man to protect the back three, and nobody could fault Joey Barton for effort as the 7.5miles he covered was only beaten at White Hart Lane by Christian Eriksen’s 7.8 miles. But while 31-year-old Barton might have been chasing the ball he didn’t win it often enough – coming out on top in only four tackles during 90 minutes. Effort: Joey Barton ran 7.5 miles in QPR's 4-0 loss to Spurs, but he won just four tackles during the game . 3) If Manchester United paid £27million up front for Luke Shaw and Arsenal shelled out £16million for Calum Chambers then the £6million Newcastle paid for Dutch full back Daryl Janmaat looks an absolute bargain. The 25-year-old who played in five of Holland’s World Cup games looked outstanding against Aston Villa both in defence and going forward – setting up a chance from which Emmanuel Riviere should have scored. He also showed he’ll be a major threat at set pieces, winning five headers as Newcastle used him as an aerial target both at corners and free kicks. Value for money: £6million buy Daryl Janmaat has looked an excellent acquisition so far for Newcastle . 4) At a time when most goalkeepers are happy to punch the ball, Lukasz Fabianski has brought security to Swansea’s defence with his willingness to come out and take crosses to ease pressure. The 29-year-old Pole, an inspired free transfer signing by manager Garry Monk, caught the ball seven times in the win over Burnley, and six during last week’ s triumph at Old Trafford. In contrast the most catches made in a game by last season’s number one Michel Vorm was the four he took at home to Norwich in December, and his average in 26 appearances was just 1.19. Safe hands: Lukasz Fabianski has been excellent so far as Swansea have won both their opening games . 5) One talent waiting to be found by whoever takes charge of Crystal Palace is Welsh midfielder Jonathan Williams who spent the end of last season on loan at Ipswich to get game time after recovering from injuries. The tiny 20-year-old, just 5ft 6ins tall, offered Selhurst Park home fans one of the few consolations in a 19 minute cameo when he replaced Barry Bannan against West Ham. He found a team mate with a pass on every one of the eight occasions when he got on the ball. Back: Welsh midfielder Jonathan Williams looked sharp for Crystal Palace during his second half cameo . 6) Steve Bruce hasn’t taken long to get the hang of rotation in his adventures in Europe - goalkeeper Allan McGregor is now the only Hull player to have appeared for all 90 minutes in each of their five fixtures so far. Centre-half James Chester had been the only outfield player in that category until his red card against Stoke yesterday. That’s already a big change in policy from last season when six of his Hull’s outfield players appeared in a total of 36 games or more. Learning on the job: Steve Bruce is getting the hang of squad rotation through Hull's Europa League campaign . 7) Newly promoted Wolves must have cursed their luck when the Championship fixture list pitted them against all three of last year’s relegated Premier League sides in their first four games. But what looked a tough start has turned out to be a doddle – the injury time Mark Hudson own goal that brought a 1-0 win against Cardiff made it a hat-trick of three-pointers. Ironically the only game to spoil the perfect start was a 1-0 defeat at Rotherham who like Kenny Jackett’s team won promotion from League One last season. Celebrations: Wolves players enjoy the late winner gifted to them by Cardiff captain Mark Hudson's own goal . 8) Felix Magath never once named an unchanged side as Fulham crashed out of the Premier League last year and his status as English football’s new Tinkerman hasn’t changed much in the Championship. After the opening day defeat at Ipswich he named four new players for the next game, swapped another five in midweek against Wolves. Ryan Williams for Mark Fotheringham was the only change before the 5-1 hammering at Derby, but you suspect that by then the damage had been done. Tinkerman: Felix Magath is yet to name an unchanged side during his time in charge of Fulham . 9) David Martin, son of West Ham legend and now broadcaster Alvin, is battling to be fit in time to face Manchester United for MK Dons in the glamour tie of Tuesday night’s Capital One Cup programme. That means former Irish Under 21 keeper Ian McLoughlin is likely to continue as stand-in for Karl Robinson’s League One side. But it’s not good news for Louis van Gaal as he tries to avoid adding a Cup upset to his list of problems – McLoughlin kept his second clean sheet in a row as Dons held Coventry to a 0-0 draw. 10) Paul Mullin played in the same Liverpool youth team as Raheem Sterling, but while his mate went on to star in England’s World Cup team he found himself released after two years at Huddersfield without a first team game. The 19-year-old, a slimly built striker with pace and a shot in both feet, is fighting back. He marked his debut a week ago by coming on with six minutes left and scoring the winner against Newport, and his first start by getting the two goals against Cambridge that leaves Jim Bentley’s side as the only team in the Football League with four wins from four.","Costa has scored twice in his opening two games for Chelsea so far .

"'Marouane Fellaini is not a Manchester United player.' That much has been the perceived wisdom across the length and breadth of this country over the last 12 months. On the evidence of some truly wretched performances, nobody, in truth, can argue with that. In the next couple of weeks, it is likely that Fellaini will exit stage left from the Theatre of Dreams and the curtain will come down on a traumatic year for the bushy-haired Belgian. Sadly, though, this last performance became a dark pantomime and a cruel exhibit of the heartless nature of football supporters. On a night of mostly uninspiring football, it may only have been boredom. Maybe they thought it was funny. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney selected to lead Red Devils' revival . Derided: Marouane Fellaini has been disappointing to many Manchester United fans since his move last term . Lashed home: Fellaini (centre) scored his first goal for United in Tuesday's friendly 2-1 win vs Valencia . When Marouane Fellaini came on with only 14 minutes to go, many were surprised. In truth, nobody really expected to see him again in the colours of Manchester United. There may not be another occasion, despite Tuesday evening's rather eccentric impact. As Old Trafford's east stand emphatically mocked every Fellaini touch and tackle, the turf of this famous old stadium must have felt a lonely, old place. It was all very unnecessary and demonstrated the unease that lingers around this club despite the sacking of David Moyes. It seems peculiar for supporters to turn against one of their own. Many United fans will argue that Fellaini is not one of theirs, instead part of the Everton enclave that arrived en-masse last summer. That is a little unfair, despite the limitations that were so visibly exposed last year. The satirical fanzine Red Issue produced a back page in April with Fellaini mocked up as a toilet brush. It read: 'Flush a fortune down the pan with a Fellaini bog brush'. The nickname has stuck and on this August evening, the jeering was merciless. VIDEO Rooney selected to lead Red Devils' revival . Group love: Despite his struggles to win over the fans Fellaini appears to be popular amongst his team-mates . On the ball: Fellaini (centre) came on for the last 14 minutes in Tuesday's friendly at Old Trafford . A sledgehammer has been taken to Fellaini's reputation but he remains an effective player and he would be a fine signing for most Premier League sides. To his credit, he kept asking for the ball, kept challenging for headers and did not shirk the challenge. The goal was a little bit slapstick, Fellaini nudging the goalkeeper and defender out of the way and as the pair tumbled over, he slotted the ball into the empty goal. The celebrations were loud and long from the United players, with Adnan Januzaj, his Belgian compatriot racing over to jump on to his back. Louis van Gaal's players clearly did not approve of Fellaini's treatment, taking it as a collective affront. With what may be transpire to be his last touch for this club, Fellaini had scored his very first goal in the very last minute. That, at least, is very much the sign of a Manchester United player. Sadly, it may all be too late. Last hurrah? Fellaini looks likely to be leaving United before the transfer window shuts .","Marouane Fellaini scored Manchester United's winner in their 2-1 victory against Valencia on Tuesday night .

"Wayne Rooney wants to forget his Manchester United captaincy debut as quickly as possible. The England striker had skippered United on several occasions before, but his first match as full-time captain came on Saturday when Swansea travelled to Old Trafford. Rooney equalised Ki Sung-Yueng's opener with an acrobatic volley but could not find another, and Swansea ran out 2-1 winners thanks to Gylfi Sigurdsson's 72nd-minute winner. VIDEO Scroll down for Van Gaal: Wayne Rooney must be a captain off the pitch too . Gutted: Wayne Rooney wants to quickly forget Manchester United's opening day defeat to Swansea . For Rooney, it was by no means a satisfactory way to start his spell as United skipper, and he quickly wants to move on from the defeat. 'It was a proud moment but a disappointing result,' he told MUTV. 'It's not one I'll look back on and remember with fond memories. 'You always want to win. It was a nice moment, but I'm disappointed we lost.' Saturday's match was an afternoon of firsts. United manager Louis van Gaal got his first taste of English football - although it will be one he wants to get out of his mouth quickly. Good time: Rooney scored the equaliser for the home side but his day didn't get any better as United lost . Tyler Blackett and Jesse Lingard made their debuts, and for Adnan Januzaj it was the first time he wore the prestigious No 11 shirt. Ryan Giggs owned that jersey for the last two decades, so the diminutive Belgian felt pride - and pressure - when he pulled it on at the weekend. 'It was a big honour for me and my family and I was very happy to have it given to me,' the young midfielder said. Tactics: Louis van Gaal's new 3-5-2 formation struggled to break down the Welsh visitors on a tough day . 'There is pressure on me because there was a legend in front of me who had it for 20 years, but I am really happy with that.' Januzaj was keen to stress nothing should be read into the defeat, which came as a big shock given that Swansea are among the favourites to be relegated this year. 'It was a very disappointing match but it's only the first one of the season so it's nothing,' said Januzaj, who came on for the injured Lingard in the first half. 'We'll move on to the next one now.' Legend in the making? Adnan Januzaj took over Ryan Giggs' No 11 shirt and he looked decent at times . Januzaj thinks United are better-equipped to recover from a setback now than they were under David Moyes, the man who led United to victory over Swansea this time last year but ended the year in seventh. 'A lot of things have changed,' Januzaj said when asked about Van Gaal's impact at the club. 'He is a top, top manager and we respect him a lot. We are working hard for him, the team and everyone else at the club. 'He was honest with us after the match but it's only the first game.' Those United fans worried about the state of their defence were given further cause for concern on Saturday. There was a lack of cohesion and focus from the back five, which turned into a back four after the break as Van Gaal ditched his 5-3-2 system. Vice-captain: Darren Fletcher was just as upset as Rooney with the way United surprisingly fell apart . United's vice-captain Darren Fletcher was unhappy both goalscorers were unmarked when they beat David De Gea. 'We conceded bad goals,' Fletcher said. 'For me it felt like Swansea scored with their first attack. 'We started the second half very well and got back into the game and then they sucker-punched us again. 'It felt like they had only two chances in the game and they've managed to score them both. That's hard to take and disappointing."" On the other hand: Gylfi Sigurdsson had a dream Swansea return, scoring the winner at Old Trafford . Sigurdsson, meanwhile, could not think of a better place to score on his second debut for Swansea. 'Getting three points at Old Trafford is always special, but to score the winner here has been a dream for me ever since I was young,' said Sigurdsson, who returned to Swansea this summer following a two-year spell at Tottenham. 'It is one of the biggest stadiums in the world.'","Rooney says game was proud moment but not one he will look back on .

"Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has become the latest celebrity to accept an Ice Bucket Challenge nomination after stripping down to his boxers to be covered with cold water. The Real Madrid star was soaked by his Portugal teammate Fabio Coentrao while sat on a chair wearing just a pair of purple boxer shorts at the club's training ground at Valdebebas, Spain. Ronaldo then called on musicians Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and Lil Wayne to join in. On Friday, former Manchester United team-mate Darren Fletcher challenged Ronaldo to take part, and the Portugal captain posted proof he had braved the ice cold water on social media platforms on Sunday. What a friend: Real Madrid team-mate Fabio Coentrao soaks Cristiano Ronaldo for Ice Bucket Challenge . The Ice Bucket Challenge craze originated in the United States with the intention of raising money for the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Association. ALS, also known as  Motor Neurone Disease, attacks the spinal cord and can lead to speech difficulties, muscle spasms and paralysis. It affects around 30,000 people in the US and 5,000 in the UK. Ex-Boston College baseball player Pete Frates came up with the idea, after his promisng career was cut short by ALS. He challenged friends and fellow Boston athletes, including some Boston Red Sox Players. Since it began, celebrities around the world have joined in with Mark Zuckerberg, Justin Timberlake and even Bill Gates. Comedian Ricky Gervais also uploaded his ice bucket challenge to his Facebook page . Now the craze has spread to football.

"Glen Johnson has admitted he could be set to leave Liverpool after talks about a new deal had gone “very quiet”. The England defender, who has just returned from a six week injury lay-off, is out of contract next summer. From January 1, he will be free to talk to foreign clubs and be able to sign a pre-contract agreement. Johnson, who joined Liverpool in 2009, has so far resisted Fenway Sports Group’s offer of a 12-month extension. Talks started earlier this year but there has been an impasse and, at present, there does not look as if there will be a resolution. Glen Johnson (centre) prepares to come on as a substitute during Liverpool's 2-1 win over West Brom . The full back had been out injured for six weeks before returning on Saturday . It has left Johnson aware that his time at time Anfield could be up at the end of the current campaign but he does not want to dwell on the issue. ‘(It’s) very quiet,’ said Johnson, who made is reappearance in Saturday’s 2-1 win over West Brom. ‘I am just concentrating week by week and not thinking about it. Of course (I want to stay). But like I say I worry about this week, this week and then next week, next week. That is how I live my life.’ Liverpool last week secured Daniel Sturridge to a new long-term contract and have opened negotiations with both Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson’s representatives about extending and improving their respective deals. Johnson trains with his Liverpool team-mates at Melwood - but he is yet to sign a new contract . Johnson, meanwhile, was injured in the second game of the season at Manchester City and his return against West Brom came too late for him to be included in the England squad for the forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Estonia and San Marino. ‘I would have preferred the international break to have come next week so I could declare myself fit and available,’ said Johnson. ’With the squad being picked last Thursday I haven’t played for six weeks so I can’t be involved. Of course I want to go away with the England team and play again for them as well. Johnson trudges off the pitch after England are eliminated by Uruguay at the World Cup . ‘It has been frustrating to watch (Liverpool) because you want to be out there on the line with the lads, and you want to be there even more when it is not going too well. The most important thing for me was getting fit and hoping the lads could pull us on while I was not able to help. ‘It is difficult when you have bad periods, but you’ll get good periods. That is football. It was always going to be difficult with the expectation (this season), but you have these ups and downs.’","Glen Johnson's Liverpool contract expires next summer .

Dana Hanna, an attorney for Stenstrom, told the Rapid City Journal . that the girl suffered physical, psychological and emotional injuries. 'There is no excuse for cops to use a Taser on an 8-year-old child,' Hanna said. Attorney Rob Anderson, who is representing the defendants in the . lawsuit, told The Associated Press on Friday that he does not comment on . pending litigation. The mother and child now live on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, according to Hanna. At the time of the incident, the the police chief is defended the . action - saying the girl was a threat to the officer and to herself and . that the Taser jolt actually saved her life. Three . officers responded to the girl's home in Pierre, South Dakota, after a babysitter dialed 911 and reported that the girl was . suicidal and stabbing herself in the leg with a 4-and-a-half-inch . kitchen knife. Police Chief Bob Grandpre said his officers responded according to protocol. Grandpre has refused to release the officer's name, but says he has not been disciplined and remains on the job. The officer said he used the Taser after the girl pointed a knife at him, then pointed it back at her own chest. The sharp probes from the stun gun hit the girl in the chest and the stomach. 'He quite possibly saved the juvenile’s life that night,' Grandpre told the Sioux Falls Argus Leader. He added that the child was a 'threat' and that his officers are trained to deal with all manner of threats. 'We can’t control if the threat is eight or 80,' Grandpre said. After the girl was subdued, she was taken to the hospital, where she was . observed for 24 hours and released to her parents.

"Liverpool's season lurched to a new low when they suffered a 1-0 defeat to Basle that threatens their prospects in the Champions League. Already struggling to keep pace in the Barclays Premier League, Brendan Rodgers needs to find an immediate remedy for the problems that are ailing Liverpool to prevent a campaign that promised so much from completely unravelling. Here, MailOnline Sport identifies five key areas where things are going wrong for Liverpool. THE SOFT CENTRE . Whichever way you present the figures, there is no easy reading. One clean sheet in nine games since the beginning of the campaign – or eight shut-outs in 31 matches in all competitions during 2014 – means Liverpool are too easy to score against. Confidence in the back line is being shredded and Rodgers cannot find the right blend to make his team difficult to beat. He has not had a settled partnership in the middle of his defence since Jamie Carragher and Daniel Agger were working in tandem at the end of 2012-13. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez scoring his first goal for Barcelona . Keeper Simon Mignolet is the last line of a Liverpool defence that has been too easy to beat this season . Marco Streller (centre) was the Basle hero with the goal to deliver a Champions League setback to Liverpool . It is imperative that Rodgers gives Liverpool steel at the back because, at the minute, every time the opposition get a corner or a free-kick, you expect a ball into the penalty area to lead to a goal. Nobody, from goalkeeper to central defenders, is prepared to take charge of the situation. ‘Too soft and easy to beat,’ were the withering appraisals of Rodgers and Steven Gerrard as they trudged out of St Jakob Park. Nobody was inclined to disagree with them . THE LACK OF PUNCH . If the goals-against column is giving Rodgers headaches, so, too, will be the amount his team are scoring. Bar one dazzling performance at White Hart Lane, when they cut Tottenham to ribbons, the verve and dash of last season has been absent. Without Luis Suarez – more on him later – and the injured Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool do not have the pace to get in behind teams and the experiment of making Mario Balotelli the spearhead of this unit is not working. He slows the team down and gives no intensity. Mario Balotelli, the Italian striker signed for £16m from AC Milan, drew a blank for Liverpool in Switzerland . Balotelli has scored just once since arriving at Anfield while Rickie Lambert has yet to open his account . Liverpool never looked like getting Basle on the turn, bar one moment when Adam Lallana set Raheem Sterling free, but the same has been true for the last month; they created next to nothing against Aston Villa, Ludogorets and their play was often charmless against Middlesbrough. THE OVER RELIANCE ON KEY PLAYERS . An outlay of more than £100million this summer should have been a sign for the creative responsibility to be shared between the squad but, so far, the same players are being asked to come up with results to save the team. Take Sterling. Rodgers does not want to expose the 19-year-old to burnout but his quality means he has played 764 of the 840 minutes of Liverpool’s season so far. Next in the list are Gerrard and Jordan Henderson (720 minutes). Raheem Sterling has been the main attacking threat in the Liverpool line-up this season . Captain and midfielder Steven Gerrard is Liverpool's joint-leading scorer this season . There is more to it than that, however. Sterling is also Liverpool’s chief creator of chances and their join-leading scorer with Gerrard. Rodgers needs other players to step forward to help the ease burden on two men at the opposite end of the age spectrum. INJURIES . In fairness to Rodgers, he has been left without his main striker for a month through no fault of his own. Sturridge would almost certainly have had an impact on results during September, given his ratio for scoring goals, while Joe Allen’s energy and tenacity have been missed. ‘It has been frustrating at times but, day by day, we will be looking to get better,’ said Rodgers. ‘Joe Allen never gets mentioned, and other guys like Emre Can and Glen Johnson returning will makes us a much stronger squad. But we are nowhere near technically where we were last season.’ Brendan Rodgers hasn't been helped by injury to striker Daniel Sturridge . England and Reds striker Sturridge has been out of action with an thigh injury sustained on international duty . NO X-FACTOR . There is no point wasting energy mourning the fact Suarez is no longer at Anfield but it is impossible not to see that Liverpool are now easy to play against without him. When Suarez was leading the line, Liverpool had intensity. He scrambled the minds of defenders, created space for other to cause havoc and his presence in the team dragged his colleagues up another level. Luis Suarez helped himself to 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season . Suarez left Liverpool for Barcelona in the summer . In his place, Balotelli has done nothing so far to show why he has been afforded such adulation by his new supporters. He arrived with a big reputation - not all of it good, by any means - but it has been hard to see why there has been such noise around him. Liverpool began this campaign aiming to build on the 84 points they collected last year and they needed a special talent to come and take over from Suarez. What they did not require was someone who only wants to turn it on when it suits. Somehow Rodgers has to unlock Balotelli's ability - and resolve the issues that are threatening to dash their dreams.","Liverpool went down to a shock defeat by Swiss outfit Basle on Wednesday .

"An air traffic controller has been suspended after leaving his control tower unattended as a flight was approaching the airport in Guyana, South America. The Ministry of Transport in Guyana said the controller and two other staff members have been suspended pending an investigation. The controller abandoned his post ten minutes before a Caribbean Airlines Boeing 737 from Trinidad was due to land at the airport. An air traffic controller has been suspended after leaving his control tower ten minutes before a Caribbean Airlines flight from Trinidad was due to land at Cheddi Jagan International Airport in Guyana (stock picture) According to the Jamaica Observer, the flight had to circle Cheddi Jagan International Airport in Georgetown until a manager was able to guide the flight safely from the tower. A Guyana Ministry of Transport spokesman said on Tuesday that the other two staff members who were suspended were a supervisor and a co-worker who had been scheduled to relieve the controller. The controller walked off the job apparently out of frustration that his co-worker did not show up to relieve him of his duties last Friday. At the time, a Caribbean Airways Boeing 737 with about 100 people on board was ten minutes from landing. A manager went to the tower and took over. The flight had to circle Cheddi Jagan International Airport (pictured) in Georgetown until a manager was able to guide the flight safely from the tower . Separately, the U.S. Embassy in Guyana warned last month that it had received 'unconfirmed threat information' about Caribbean Airlines flights from the South American country to the United States. Americans were subsequently told to avoid using the carrier until the issue is resolved. The warning about the unconfirmed threats was posted on the embassy's website, but no specific details have been released.","The government in Guyana announced the controller has been suspended .

"It is not so long ago that Nathaniel Clyne would travel to training sharing doubts about his ability to break into the first-team at Crystal Palace. 'Oh definitely,' smiled Clyne. 'I’ve been on a long journey and making it through the Palace ranks. I was not selected much at the time and then I was fortunate to get in and made my mark and got through.' He moved to Southampton, two years ago, but it was his former Palace team-mate and regular chauffeur Kieron Cadogan gave his secret away on Twitter. Nathaniel Clyne (left) hopes to make his mark after being called up to the senior England squad for the first time . Clyne's brilliant start to the season included scoring a stunning winner at Arsenal in the Capital One Cup . Former Crystal Palace team-mate Kieron Cadogan tweeted his congratulations after the squad announcement . 'Used to drive this guy to training and he would complain he doubts he’ll get into the first team at Palace,' tweeted Cadogan, now playing in Sweden’s second tier for GAIS, when Roy Hodgson named Clyne in his England squad for the first time. 'Now I’m doing well but the call-up still came as a surprise to me,' said Clyne. 'I still need to improve on my game and hopefully this will be another step for me, to play for England, and hopefully I will improve. 'I’m buzzing. I can’t wait to get started and join in with the lads - they’re world class players - and to see what they are like in training and hopefully I can match up to that. I need to show what I’m about.' Nathaniel Clyne (right) challenges Nacer Chadli in Sunday's defeat at Spurs . The young right-back has won eight England Under 21 caps and hopes to make his senior bow . The influence of Saints' bosses present and past in Ronald Koeman and Mauricio Pochettino has been key . Clyne got a call from the FA on Thursday, only a couple of hours before the squad was publicly released, and the 23-year-old immediately called his mother with the news. 'She’s been a big part in my career,' he said. 'She was crying on the phone. I’m happy and proud and will go with England to show I’m capable of wearing the jersey. I feel I’m good enough. I have to show that.' There were thanks, too, for Southampton manager Ronald Koeman. 'He has given me confidence,' said Clyne. 'He says I can be one of the best right-backs in the Premier League. I have grown up.' The Southampton full-back will be among familiar faces with former Saints players Calum Chambers, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, also in the squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia. And he knows others, like Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from the Under 21 team. 'My aim is to take it step by step but I’m not here for fun,' Clyne added. 'I’m here to nail my colours to the mast. Hopefully I will take that right-back position and make it my own.' Nathaniel Clyne keeps his eye on the ball as he looks to build another Southampton attack . The young defender will be joined in the England squad by former colleagues Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert . Injuries to the likes of Glen Johnson (centre) and John Stones have boosted Nathaniel Clyne's chances . Right-back is one of the positions where Hodgson is blessed with no shortage of players, all playing regularly in the Barclays Premier League but, of the senior candidates, Kyle Walker is injured, and Glen Johnson only just back after injury. Jon Flanagan, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are all injured and John Stones, who played there against Norway and Switzerland, last month, damaged an ankle during Everton’s defeat at Manchester United on Sunday. All of which leaves Hodgson to choose between Chambers and Clyne, or James Milner.","The Southampton defender is set to make his senior international debut .

Holiday camp chain, Butlins, has just announced a £16m investment into new 'mum-friendly' chalets . Mumsnet consulted on these new bedroom designs at the Butlins Ocean Hotel in Bognor Regis . There will be 117 chalets, which are due to open next April. The expenditure is Butlins' biggest in 2015 and follows a £2m upgrade this year at Minehead and its holiday centres at Bognor Regis in West Sussex and Skegness in Lincolnshire. The plans also include Just For Tots breaks, which include the new Bear Care service - which involves youngsters checking in toys to a hotel desk so they won't be lost on days out. The new Bognor Regis accommodation boasts a fun fair and a race track for go-karting . Bourne Leisure head of travel trade Neil Davies said the design was selected after consulting with users on the parenting website. Butlins was founded by Billy Butlin in the 1930s with the aim of providing affordable holidays for ordinary families in the UK, after a particularly terrible holiday taken as a child to Barry Island. Ten camps were built between 1936 and 1966, but many operations closed by the 1990s following a change in holiday demands. Three camps still operate today - Bognor Regis, Minehead and Skegness - though it is the Minehead location that will benefit from the multi-million pound chalet refurbishment. Butlins is widely known for this particular type of accommodation, which was originally the only way to stay in their camps and consisted of long lines of single bedrooms in blocks. Today, each site offers family-fun activities, organised by Redcoats (Butlins staff named after their signature attire), including a Splash Waterworld water park at each location. He added: 'We have worked with the Mumsnet website to consult with mums on a number of the design features, features, furnishing and surrounding area, thus attempting to ensure they meets the needs and wishes of hard-working families. 'We asked questions to 1,000 of their members - on everything from what would surprise them on a family break through to their concerns about what gets in the way of quality time. 'They consulted on everything from how many TVs there should be through to shaping outside areas with tranquil lakes and outdoor spaces to help kids make friends.' Chalets will also include arts and crafts equipment and board games to ensure that rain never gets in the way of play time. 'We have gone back on what made us great to draw inspiration for this new development,' the spokesman added. 'The chalets will be as lovable as they've always been and will hopefully surprise people who have a view of Butlins as being old fashioned - they represent a truly modern shift in family breaks.' An artistic rendering shows what the new Mumsnet-approved chalets are expected to look like . Inside, the chic, streamlined decor will provide all you need for a relaxing family vacation . The 2015 investment was announced in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana where the annual convention of UK travel association Abta is taking place. Now in it's second year, the VisitEngland project has generated a total of £517.9m additional spending by UK residents on trips in their own country. VisitEngland is supported by a nearly £20m grant from the government. The initiative has also helped to create 9,620 additional jobs in the tourism industry. Strategy and development director of VisitEngland, Louise Steward said: 'It is rewarding and encouraging to see the campaign succeed in boosting the visitor economy, creating jobs and inspiring people to take a holiday in England.' The Butlins holiday camp in Skegness was one of the first to open its doors - in 1936 . In 1976, there were ten different Butlins properties in operation, including the Margate Hotel . Meanwhile, the continuing warm weather in the UK has led to a big jump in autumn seaside resort bookings, according to Expedia.co.uk. Bookings for the East Sussex resort of Eastbourne are up 112 per cent for September and October compared with the same period last year, while bookings for Scarborough in Yorkshire are up 109 per cent. There have also been big rises in bookings for Blackpool, which is up 76 per cent, Torquay in Devon, up 60 per cent, and Bournemouth in Dorset, up 48 per cent. The top beach destinations for September and October are Blackpool, Brighton and Bournemouth.","Holiday camp chain worked closely with Mumsnet to design accommodation .

"What a start to the season Glasgow Warriors have made. Four wins out of a possible four — including two bonus points — is better than Gregor Townsend could possibly have hoped for. I was really interested to see how they would respond to making the Pro12 final last year because there was a chance they might have become complacent over the summer and thought they had cracked it. What we have seen has been quite the opposite and proves what a strong club the Warriors have become both on and off the pitch. Stuart Hogg (left) and Duncan Weir celebrate as Glasgow beat Connacht 39-21 on Friday night . Nearly 6,000 fans turned up at Scotstoun last Friday night to see them play Connacht (not the biggest draw in the league) which was great to see and proof that the public are buying into what the Warriors are doing. It’s also been great to hear and see the reaction from opposition coaches, supporters and media to their performances so far this season. All of them are saying what a quality side the Warriors are. They have earned respect from people who, not too long ago, had no respect for Scottish rugby at all. This is especially true in Wales where they just didn’t take Glasgow seriously. That has totally changed now, not just because the Warriors have won back-to-back in South Wales already this season, but because of their consistent improvement over the last five years or so. Mark Bennett charges away from the Connacht defence during the comfortable victory at Scotstoun . They have earned that respect the only way you can — by winning consistently and not just having the odd stand-out performance that wins you one-off games. You also have to consider the number of injuries Glasgow have had to contend with to fully understand how good a start they have made. Ryan Grant, Jonny Gray and Sean Maitland haven’t played at all, while the likes of Al Kellock, Tom Ryder and Finn Russell were only involved for the first time last Friday. Their impressive form has been the result of two things — good recruitment policy and good management of the players. I’ve been very impressed with how Townsend has been able to make big changes almost every week with very little drop in performance levels and team spirit. There is a real togetherness in the squad which manifests itself on the pitch in the form of good rugby. Duncan Weir adds another three points as Gregor Townsend's side secured a fourth win in four . The strength in depth was highlighted when the Glasgow A team put 30 points on Edinburgh A last Monday and it must make Townsend’s selection meetings very tough indeed. When his injured players are all back, Townsend might not know his best team. What he will be able to do, though, is pick the best team to play against whoever the opposition is because he has different styles of players in most positions. One coach who would love that kind of luxury is Alan Solomons. He has real issues to deal with because I don’t think he is close to knowing what his best team is. Adam Ashe powers through as Glasgow triumphed again despite the absence of some of their stars . Like Glasgow, Edinburgh have had some injuries to deal with, especially to Dave Denton, Matt Scott and Grant Gilchrist, but there lies the gulf between the two Scottish sides. Edinburgh have not got anywhere near the strength in depth of Glasgow and that was shown to devastating effect down at the Ospreys when they shipped 60 points. It was one of the worst performances I’ve seen for quite some time and took us back to a time when Scottish sides were laughing stocks in Wales. There was a redemption of sorts with a draw against the Scarlets, but Edinburgh still have major issues and they have a tough trip to Ulster this coming Friday. I think Solomons needs to do the opposite of Townsend and pick a team that he believes is his best and stick with it. There have been so many new players coming in that they haven’t yet had the chance to gel together on the pitch. Scotland has two clubs with very different problems to face. One has to find some form and a first team, while the other has become the team everyone wants to beat.","Warriors have won four out of four after last year's Pro12 final .

"Andrew Sheridan has been forced to retire from rugby with immediate effect on medical grounds, at the age of 34, after being advised that his damaged neck can no longer take the strain. The man who became revered and feared as England’s scrum destroyer-in-chief — winning 40 Test caps for his country and two for the Lions — received the grim news in the last fortnight. Having gone to see a specialist to discover if there was any hope that he might be able to carry on playing, he was advised against doing so. Andrew Sheridan (centre) in action for Toulon, against Sale Sharks in Salford, England . Sheridan (poses for cameras with his son in May 2013 (left) and competes for England in 2009 (right) Marseille marvel: His defining moment as a Test player. England shocked Australia 12-10 in the World Cup quarter-final at Stade Velodrome as Sheridan led a demolition of the opposition scrum. The image of him grappling with Matt Dunning symbolised a triumph based on power. Wallaby conquest: The same rival nation had already suffered from the force of Sheridan’s set-piece work at Twickenham two years earlier. Al Baxter was sin-binned in the midst of a brutal ordeal and Dunning eventually left on a stretcher as England’s loosehead wrought havoc. Victorious Lion: Sheridan gave a performance of primal aggression to help the tourists claim a consolation 28-9 win over the fearsome Springboks at Ellis Park. Having been promoted into the Lions’ starting XV, the then Sale prop made a monstrous all-round impact. Vintage Ted: Shortly before his body failed him once too often, ‘Big Ted’ inspired a scrum blitz by Toulon which yielded three penalty tries against Cardiff Blues. The veteran’s masterclass propelled his club into the Heineken Cup quarter-finals and they went on to retain their title. Sheridan had one season remaining on his contract with French side Toulon, but in the summer the club began planning for the likelihood of losing him and the worst-case scenario was realised. He had considered the possibility of looking for another club, before being given the medical orders to call time on his career. ‘Big Ted’ last played for Toulon in February, when he had to come off during a home Top 14 match against Biarritz at Stade Felix Mayol. Soon afterwards he had surgery on his neck, but the operation didn’t serve as a miracle cure. He had suffered an injury in the same area last November and it was apparent that he could no longer withstand the persistent problems. An official announcement arrived on Tuesday morning from Sheridan’s management company, James Grant, confirming that he has retired in order to pursue a career in the wine trade. Since moving to France in 2012, he has been studying in order to turn a hobby into a full-time venture, and after completing qualifications he plans to become a wine buyer. As a rugby player, Sheridan went out on a high at club level. In 2013, he was a stalwart of the multi-national Toulon team who won the Heineken Cup, beating French rivals Clermont Auvergne in the final in Dublin. And before the operation which ultimately signified the end of his career, the loosehead prop had helped put his side on course to retain their European title and finish last season with the coveted domestic prize — the Bouclier de Brennus; as Top 14 champions. Sheridan is tackled by Australia's Daniel Vickerman during the Rugby World Cup quarter-final in 2007 . Matt Dunning (right) goes head-to-head with Sheridan in the quarter-final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup . Prior to his move across the Channel, he spent nine seasons at Sale and was part of their Premiership- winning team of 2006. However, Sheridan’s reputation was primarily founded on his scrummaging feats on behalf of England. He was a nemesis for Australia, having reduced their set piece to rubble on his first Test start in 2005 and again in the World Cup quarter-final in 2007. He toured with the Lions in 2005 and made two Test appearances four years later. His exploits on behalf of Toulon were so consistently impressive last year that he was touted as a contender for Warren Gatland’s Lions squad at the age of 33. Typically of the man, he was bemused by the hype and the fuss —seeking to dispel it himself. ‘It was a great honour to play for the Lions in 2005 and 2009 and I wish them all the best, but my ambitions lie in Toulon,’ he said shortly before the touring squad was announced. ‘There isn’t much substance behind the suggestion I might be picked — it’s just talk.’ Sheridan certainly wasn’t one for idle talk and he will avoid any fanfare as he steps into retirement, but he deserves acclaim. Amid all the tears, strains, breaks, ruptures and operations, he was revered and feared. Sheridan has struggled with injury, pictured (right) with England team doctor Simon Kemp in 2007 .

"Exeter moved up to fourth in the Aviva Premiership table after a 36-13 win over Harlequins at Sandy Park on Sunday. The victory was only the Chiefs' second home league win in 2014 and they are now just a point behind Bath ahead of next week's trip to struggling Newcastle while Quins drop to ninth place. A try from Thomas Waldrom plus 14 points from the boots of Gareth Steenson and Henry Slade helped Exeter into a comfortably 19-6 half-time lead but Harlequins were back in it thanks to a converted 46th-minute try from Fiji winger Aseli Tikoirotuma.

However, the visitors, who lost young centre Harry Sloan through injury after just 15 minutes, could not make any more inroads into Exeter's lead and further tries from skipper Jack Yeandle and Slade helped the hosts claim an ultimately convincing victory. While Quins named an unchanged starting line-up the Chiefs promoted Jack Nowell and full-back Phil Dollman from the bench while Will Chudley came in at scrum-half in place of Haydn Thomas who was ruled out with concussion. The visitors were quickly on the scoreboard with a penalty through fly-half Ben Botica after just two minutes but the Chiefs replied with long-range kicks from Slade and Steenson to make it 6-3. Exeter then scored the first of their three tries in the 23rd minute. The Chiefs made a mess of their lineout on the Quins 22 with the ball taken at the back by hooker Dave Ward, but the ball went loose when he was tackled by Waldrom. The England number eight then hacked on, caught the ball on the bounce to go over the line. Steenson added the extras to give the Chiefs a 13-3 lead before New Zealand-born Botica saw a 30-metre penalty attempt hit the near upright. However, he found his mark again to reduce the arrears from the other side of the field. Harlequins' Mike Brown (right) is tackled by Henry Slade (centre) during the Aviva Premiership match . Chris Robshaw (left) is tackled by Will Chudley (centre) during Sunday's Aviva Premiership match . Slade cancelled it out from the left touchline and then Steenson added his second penalty from the right touchline to give the Chiefs a well deserved 13-point advantage with the last play of the half. Harlequins had a touchdown from full-back Mike Brown ruled out for a knock on by TMO Geoff Warren after the restart but they kept the pressure on and reduced the arrears with Tikoirotuma powering over the line. Botica added the simple conversion. Quins then received a further boost when Nowell, in his first start since he injured a shoulder during Exeter's defeat at Leicester last March, was sent to the sin-bin when he turned his back when going up for a high ball against Brown. That incident happened 16 minutes from time with the Chiefs 22-13 ahead, but Quins could not take advantage and Steenson increased the home side's lead with his third penalty. Slade missed with another chance but Exeter further increased their lead as Steenson's chip across field was collected by Dollman who, when tackled, had hooker Yeandle up in support to cross for Exeter's second try, converted by Steenson. Exeter continued to push on as they searched for a third try and they got it with four minutes left when replacement Tim James gave a long pass out wide to Slade, who raced to the line before Steenson added the extras.","Rob Baxter's Exeter Chiefs beat Harlequins 36-13 at Sandy Park on Sunday .

"Tom Varndell set his sights on a century of Aviva Premiership tries and the all-time scoring record after striking twice at Adams Park to condemn Newcastle to a 20th successive league defeat. The 29-year-old wing took his personal try tally in the competition to 79 — seven behind Mark Cueto — as Wasps surged into fifth in the table with this bonus-point victory. Having touched down once in each half, Varndell revealed his ambition to finish his career ahead of his wing rival from Sale. ‘I’m chasing him, but I’ve still got a long way to go,’ he said. ‘Of course that’s a target of mine but I’m not going to set a time-frame for it. I just have to focus on playing well for my team, but there is always that carrot that I want to finish as top try-scorer. Wasps's prolific Tom Varndell crosses for his second try against Newcastle . A general view of a line out during the Aviva Premiership match between Wasps and Newcastle Falcons . Wasps' James Gaskell claims the ball from a line out during the Aviva Premiership match at Adams Park . Wasps: Miller; Tagicakibau, Daly, Leiua (Wade, 66), Varndell; Goode (Masi, 54), Simpson (Davies, 57); Mullan (Yapp, 60), Festuccia (Lindsay, 57), Cooper-Woolley (Cittadini, 56); Gaskell, Myall (Cannon, 66); Johnson, Jackson (Hughes, 64) Sin bin: Wade, 73 . Newcastle: Hammersley; Tait (Alesana Tuilagi, 53), Tiesi, Powell, Sinoti; Socino (Clegg, 56), Tipuna (Fury, 59); Brookes (Rogers, 34), Lawson (Hawkins, 59), S Wilson (Tomaszczyk, 59); Green, Barrow (Furno, 51); M Wilson (Mayhew, 51), Hogg . ‘That would be nice. I’m not sure how long I would keep it for, because there are a lot of young wingers coming through, but chasing Cueto is definitely one of my targets.’ Varndell admitted being left out of the Wasps side for the first game of the season — following the signing of Sailosi Tagicakibau from London Irish — had served as a ‘kick up the a**e’ which has led to a run of three tries in three matches. He has his eye on the three-figure landmark, adding: ‘100 tries in your career in the Premiership would be awesome.’ England aren’t exactly awash with prolific try-scoring candidates to play on the wing ahead of next year’s World Cup, but Varndell hasn’t played for his country since 2008. He retains faint hope, saying: ‘It’s in my head, but I can’t go out thinking about that. I’m 29, I’m not ancient. I’ve got to carry on playing the best I can and hopefully Stuart (Lancaster) will see what I can offer.’ This was not an emphatic triumph by Wasps, but it was a good return given that director of rugby, Dai Young, had rotated his squad, with England lock Joe Launchbury resting in the stand. Their victory was founded on a superb showing by South African flanker Ashley Johnson, who carried strongly, handled with sublime class and set up two tries, as well as tackling with gusto and competing fiercely at the breakdown. ‘I thought he was a deserving man of the match,’ said Young. ‘He has been outstanding for us all season — he’s a real talisman and he comes up with some big plays.’ However, Young’s opposite number, Dean Richards, was not convinced by one of those plays — the pass to send Varndell away for his second try. It looked marginally forward, but was not reviewed by the referee — another Dean Richards — and that incensed the man in charge of Newcastle, who suggested his struggling team had been harshly treated.

Newcastle Falcons' Sinoti Sinoti (right) is tackled by Wasps' Carlo Festuccia  at Adams Park on Sunday . Wasps' Kearnan Myall claims the ball from a lineout during the Aviva Premiership match at Adams Park . ‘Tom Varndell scored a try off a pass by Ashley Johnson which was only two yards forward,’ he quipped. ‘I don’t know why the ref didn’t come back for that and it really affected the morale of our guys. You don’t get anything when you are down at the bottom and the refs don’t even listen. Our physios and water-boys told the ref that was a forward pass and he didn’t even listen.’ Remarkably, Richards claimed the Falcons’ sequence of league defeats, which is nearing a full calendar year in duration is ‘not much of a concern to the guys at all’. It should be, as the North East club are destined for another season of grim struggle against the spectre of relegation. At least the visitors scored two tries — the first a twisting effort from scrum half Ruki Tipuna and the second a penalty try at the death when Christian Wade was sin-binned for what was deemed a deliberate knock-on near his own line. They could have had another, but Alex Rogers knocked on over the line in the second half. Yet, the outcome was not really in doubt from the 20th minute, when Elliot Daly’s sharp offload teed up Varndell’s first try. Andy Goode’s kicking kept the hosts in front and James Gaskell galloped over before the break. Johnson set up Varndell for another left-corner strike and Rob Miller burst away for Wasps’ bonus-point try from Wade’s pass in the closing stages. Young had mixed feelings, saying: ‘Parts of our game were very good and parts of our game were messy,’ but his side are heading in the right direction.","Wasps comfortably see off Newcastle at Adams Park to jump up five spots .

"Pointless: Grant Shapps said holding a vote for lifting the ban with such strong opposition would be a waste of time . The ban on hunting with dogs will not be overturned, Tory chairman Grant Shapps declared yesterday. Speaking on the day that a quarter of a million supporters turned out for Boxing Day hunts, he said there was no chance of getting the majority needed to scrap Labour's law. Earlier, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he was not expecting a vote in 2013, because it was clear the Government would lose. And yesterday the outspoken new head of the RSPCA, Gavin Grant, taunted David Cameron on his failure to bring forward a vote on fox hunting – telling him it was because he knows he will lose. The Prime Minister had pledged a free vote in the Commons on reversing the ban on fox hunting before the 2015 election. But almost three years into his Coalition, no vote has yet been timetabled. A poll, released yesterday, found that 76 per cent of the public are against moves to legalise fox hunting. The IpsosMori survey also found that 81 per cent oppose deer hunting. Mr Shapps said: 'As Owen Paterson said, it makes sense to bring something forward if you think there's a chance of there being a Parliamentary majority. 'At the moment there doesn't appear to be one.' But Mr Grant said that Mr Cameron still had two and a half years to make good on his pledge to hold a vote on overturning the hunting ban. The former PR man, who seems determined to make the RSPCA more political, said: 'It is in the Coalition agreement and this Government seem intent upon enacting the Coalition agreement line by line so I think we've got to assume it will come,' he said. 'It's great to see the Coalition bringing forward legislation to grant gay people the same rights to marriage as straight people, so the notion that at the same time we could reintroduce something that was seen as appropriate in the 19th century and very inappropriate in the 20th century is absolutely bizarre. 'If the Prime Minister feels he wants to have his vote then let him have his vote. He will discover that he's going to lose and maybe that's necessary to end this discussion about the Act.' Earlier this month, the RSPCA successfully took the Heythrop Hunt in Oxfordshire – whose previous riders include the Prime Minister – to court for illegally killing foxes. The battle cost £330,000, an enormous sum from the RSPCA's depleted coffers. The hunt itself was only fined £4,000. No vote: Mr Shapps' comments on the vote to lift the hunting ban comes on one of the biggest hunting days of the year - Boxing Day - where many hunting parties set out with dogs despite the ban . Mr Grant has also taken on the . National Farmers' Union over the badger cull. He appeared to call for a . milk boycott aimed at dairy farmers who had shot the animals on their . land – but he later retracted this. He has also attacked the Grand . National for being cruel to horses, going further than any previous . RSPCA chief in calling for the removal of the notorious Becher's Brook . fence. Mr Grant's confidence on keeping the . hunting ban in place was matched by Mr Paterson's indication that moves . to repeal it may not happen next year. No dogs allowed: Using dogs as part of fox hunts have been made illegal, with drag hunts still permitted, but many Tory MPs want the ban lifted . No need to vote: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson argued that a vote could only be justified when there is a chance of parliamentary majority in favour of the issue . The minister said: 'There's only a point having a vote if you're going to win. 'At the moment, it would not be my . proposal to bring forward a vote we were going to lose. There needs to . be more work done on Members of Parliament.' He added: 'It is our clear intention to have a free vote but we need to choose an appropriate moment.' Simon Hart, Tory MP for Carmarthen . West and South Pembrokeshire, warned Mr Cameron he could lose vital . rural votes if he does not table a vote. He said: 'We are only . two-and-a-half years into a five-year parliament, there is plenty of . time to deal with this. 'I'm confident that we've got a strong . commitment from the PM and he knows that he's made a promise on this; . he knows he can't really afford to let down core voters in rural . constituencies.' Labour's environment spokesman Mary Creagh said: 'Most people back Labour's ban on hunting wild animals with dogs. 'People are worried about their . incomes falling, prices rising and losing their jobs, yet this out of . touch Tory-led government wants to bring back hunting.' The Countryside Alliance said it had seen no slackening of support for hunting in recent years. But executive chairman Sir Barney . White-Spunner admitted now may not be the best time for a Commons vote. 'If you were going to go for some sort of repeal then it would probably . take a ... huge amount of parliamentary time at a time when the . Government and Parliament's got other priorities,' he said.","Grant Shapps defended decision to delay vote on hunting ban .

Many of the 670 crew who take part in the 40,000-mile race are inexperienced sailors, and many of them drop out - as Ms Harvey did - before the finish line. Sailing case: Lawyer Ruth Harvey, 50, left, is suing Clipper race organiser Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, 75, right . Despite her not completing the race, her yacht, Jamaica Get All Right, crossed the finish line in London in eighth place. Now the lawyer, who admitted before the race 'I am pretty scared, to be honest' - is claiming that as a crew member she was an employee of the race organisers, and is suing on the grounds of both victimisation and harassment. Ms Harvey, a former partner at American law firm Hunton & Williams, has decades of experience in her field of law. A preliminary hearing of her case was heard in Southampton a fortnight ago, and she has not elaborated on her allegations. But she told the law blog Roll On Friday: 'I was a worker for the provisions of the Employment Rights Act as regards safety and that I was covered by Equality Act provisions 'in any capacity' on board as regards harassment. 'Complex legal argument here involves both domestic and EU law, and similar recent cases have gone as far as the Supreme Court.' A two-day tribunal in November will decide whether Ms Harvey can be classed an employee, despite her having paid to take part. Ms Harvey was a crew member on board the 75ft yacht, Jamaica Get All Right, which finished in eighth place . A spokesman for Sir Robin confirmed that they were involved in a 'tribunal process with Ms Harvey' and added: 'It is our policy not to comment further upon ongoing legal matters.' Before she began the race last autumn, Ms Harvey set up a Just Giving fundraising page to make money for her chosen charity, Cornwall Air Ambulance Trust. She wrote of the race: 'It will be an amazing and terrifying experience, taking 11 months, and covering 45,000 nautical miles. 'I am sailing on boat Jamaica, a fabulous team, and lucky enough to be skippered by the amazing Pete Stirling... 'I am circumnavigating because you get one life, and because the Cornwall Air Ambulance saves thousands of lives.' The race was founded in 1995 by Knox-Johnston, 75, to allow people to have the chance to circumnavigate the globe for 11 months. Before the race began, he and Ms Harvey enjoyed a better relationship.  The sailor, who in 1969 became the first person to single-handedly circumnavigate the globe non-stop, took part in a video made by Ms Harvey mimicking Sir Alan Sugar in The Apprentice. Knox-Johnston said in the film: 'Ruth - I've never seen such a potential disaster in all my life. 'You're fired'.","Ruth Harvey, 50, of Wanstead, east London, is suing the sailing legend .

"These heartwarming pictures show seven-year-old mother Shin Shin cuddling her new-born at Ueno Zoo in Tokyo. The people of Japan are celebrating the first baby panda born in the country in 24 years. The birth was captured on night vision webcam and a video was quickly released by Ueno Zoo showing Shin Shin giving birth and holding the tiny baby to her chest. Scroll down for video . Love and care: Shin Shin cuddles her newly born baby holding the cub close to her chest . The sex of the cub, born on Thursday, has not yet been determined. It is the first panda to be born after being conceived naturally in Japanese history. The task is extremely difficult task as female pandas are only in heat for 72 hours over the entire year and can only become pregnant during a 24 hour slot. In the wild female pandas normally have a cub every two or three years. The unnamed cub is too young to have gained the characteristic black marks and its size is not living up to the name of Giant Panda . The unnamed baby panda caused a stir even before it was born. When it was announced last week that Shin Shin was pregnant Japanese governor Shintaro Ishihara suggested Shin Shin’s baby be named Sen Sen or Kaku Kaku – a wordplay on the disputed Senkaku Islands which are part of Japan but are claimed by both Taiwan and China. The giant panda is threatened by loss of habitat, poaching and a low reproduction rate. Females in the wild normally have a cub once every two to three years. Only about 1,600 pandas live in the wild, mostly in China's southwestern Sichuan province. Around 300 live in captivity mostly in Chinese breeding centres and zoos but also in foreign zoos around the world. China’s policy on panda export is very strict in order to protect their national symbol. A panda is never sold to a foreign country, but is instead on loan for a yearly fee of up to £650,000. There is also a clause that any cubs born during the loan belong to the People's Republic of China and have to be returned within two years. He got a quick response from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei regarding the islands, known to the Chinese as the Diaoyu. Speaking at a press conference in the capital last Friday he said: ‘Ishihara’s scheme to undermine China-Japan relations is a clumsy performance. It will only tarnish the image of Japan and Tokyo,’ ‘No matter what names the Japanese side gives, it cannot change the fact that the two pandas belong to China. ‘Likewise, what names Japan gives to the Diaoyu Island and the adjacent isles, it cannot change the fact that these islands belong to China.’ The zoo's panda team, comprised of five . workers and four veterinarians, will continue using two cameras to . observe the pair 24 hours a day for about a week, and have been joined . by a breeding expert from Sichuan, China, where Shin Shin grew up. Visitors to the zoo eager to see the . baby will be disappointed as Ueno Zoo, which is the oldest in Japan, has . expressed wishes to keep the cub and mother away from the public for . another six months. Shin Shin and her mate, Ri Ri, are on loan from China for 10 years. Under the terms of the agreement between Japan and China, the cub will be sent back in two years. Just the two of us: The cub is the first to be born in Japan in 24 years and will no be displayed to the public for six months .","First panda born in Japan in 24 years and first ever to be conceived naturally in the country .

"England could play matches in different towns and cities around the country from 2018 if the  FA secures an NFL franchise based at Wembley Stadium. If they do, it would mean that some England internationals could be moved around the country as they were between 2000 and 2007 when Wembley was rebuilt after the original stadium was demolished. While the construction of the new 90,000-seater arena was taking place, England played to packed-out grounds at Old Trafford in Manchester, Newcastle United's St James' Park and Villa Park in Birmingham, among other places. VIDEO Scroll down to watch brilliant time-lapse footage of Wembley filling up with NFL fans . Miami Dolphins played the Oakland Raiders in an NFL International Series match at the end of September . The NFL matches played at Wembley are always a success, and there is interest in a London-based franchise . With the new Wembley in the making, England were forced to play a number of home games around the country...the Three Lions played 34 matches in this period, gracing 14 different venues which included: Villa Park, Anfield, Pride Park, White Hart Lane, St. James' Park, Old Trafford, Elland Road, St Mary's, Upton Park, Stadium of Light, Walkers Stadium, Riverside Stadium, Portman Road, Old Trafford, City of Manchester Stadium . The FA is contractually obligated to play all England at Wembley for another three years but sources close to the national association say that, although the majority of games would still be played there, there would be some room for flexibility. NFL matches have been played at Wembley down the years since 1986 and three regular season matches are being played in the capital in 2014 - raising around £12 million pounds in revenue. After costs are deducted the balance can be used by the FA, with some of that money going towards paying off the cost of building the stadium.

"The man popularly known as the fast-food visionary who inspired Taco . Bell's billion-dollar Doritos Locos Tacos has died of cancer - after . never making one cent from them. Todd Mills, 41, who had a brainwave for the idea while watching TV in 2009 passed away on Thanksgiving, surrounded by his wife and two daughters, Tyler, 19, and Lainey,6, after Taco Bell donated just $1,000 towards his medical bills. Vice president of media and information at the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce, Mills lobbied Taco Bell and the owners of Doritos for two years using a much loved and humorous Facebook campaign that had millions of followers and in March 2012 finally saw his hybrid snack become a reality. Scroll down for video . Moment of truth: Todd Mills was invited to Taco Bell's California headquarters to be one of the first to taste the Doritos Locos Tacos - which he conceived of in 2009 while watching television . It was in August that Mills was struck down by cancer and he was forced to stop work and endured two brain surgeries and lung surgery. His . friends and family set up a website to accept donations to help with . his medical bills and on September 24th, Taco Bell donated $1,000 to the fund after a friend reached out to the company via Twitter according to USA Today. The fund for Mills was seeking to raise $10,000 and with Taco Bell's donation exceeded this to make $11,525 for the father-of two. The same friends told USA Today that Mills was a proud man 'with a good idea and a good heart' and that he would never have set up such a site himself. Indeed, his friends often urged him to seek some form of compensation for the taco, especially as he became one of its chief supporters through social media. Modest to the end though, Mills told . the Arkansas Times last year that he was not looking for money, the fact that the . meal exists was enough. 'Everybody that I tell about this says 'You should be getting some money off these.' 'I've never once said that I deserved any sort of compensation,' he said. 'I can't be the first person to think of this.' The MailOnline approached Taco Bell for comment about their donation to Todd Mills' medical bills, but at the time of publication had not received a response. Proud dad: Todd with his daughter, Lainey seen here on his You Caring fundraising website . Confirmation of donation: This grab taken from Todd Mills' You Caring medical fundraising website shows that Taco Bell put up $1,000 towards the 41-year-olds treatment - of which $11,250 was collected in total . Since the launch the Doritos Locos Tacos, the range has been expanded to three different flavors and sales last year exceeded $1 billion. Indeed, more than 600 million units have been sold to date and Taco Bell, which is owned by Yum!Brands, which also owns KFC and Pizza Hut, considers the item to be its most successful launch ever. However, Mills never received a penny, despite the acknowledgement from both Doritos owner, Frito-Lay and Taco Bell for his part in popularizing the game-changing fast-food snack. For his part, Mills always shrugged of any attention his bright spark brought him, simply happy to have had his 'cool idea' come true. The story of how one man helped to change the face of America's fast-food habits began more than three years ago - his wife Ginger said that her husband would often use Doritos in taco salads. Then in 2009, Mills was eating a normal taco while watching the television and as he described it a 'lightbulb went off'. 'I looked at my wife and said, 'How awesome would it be if this taco shell was a Dorito?' recounted Mills in an interview last year with the Arkansas Times. The idea would not budge and in late 2010 the successful businessman decided to write a letter to Frito-Lay to pitch it, but he soon got back a reply that basically said, 'Thanks, but no thanks'. 'Imagine this…taco shells made from Doritos,' he wrote to Frito-Lay. 'I know…It’s an amazing thing to ponder.' The chip-giant told Mills that they only accepted product ideas from employees. Undeterred by this, Mills took to Facebook to drum up the help of social media to make his dream to have orange Dorito's tacos become a reality. Grief: Widow Ginger told MailOnline: 'Obviously it's going to be tough for us. I think it's sweet that all of his friends are doing this for him'. She added that she thinks Todd would be embarrassed by the campaign . His page was entitled 'Taco Shells Made from Doritos Movement' onto which he posted updates of his campaign and celebrities holding the as-yet unreal fast-food snack. Eventually, the page racked up over 3,000 likes. The online food blogs of the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Time had linked to the page. The page views soon spiked over a million. With his social media campaign . and public swell of support, it is unclear how much influence Mills . actually had on the decision to go ahead with the snack. One day, Todd noticed Taco Bell had commented on one of his images. 'He was really excited,' Ginger said to Today. 'Taco Bell was paying attention to him. Of course, we called everyone we knew.' Then, out of the blue in February 2012, Mills received a phone call from Taco Bell, to invite him to their California headquarters where they were going to show him something special. One of his final posts: This humorous post was one of the final updates that Mills made to his 'Taco Shells from Doritos Movement' and refers to President George W. Bush giving his 'Mission Accomplished' speech about Iraq in 2003 . Forest Gump would have approved: Mills used many different memes and celebrities to bolster his campaign to have the snack adopted by Taco Bell and Doritos . When he arrived he was shown and tasted his dream come to life - what became known as the Doritos Locos Tacos. Officials at Taco Bell told him that they had been approached by Frito Lay in 2010 with a proposal to combine their two brands. And Mills realized that he had written his letter six-months after Frito Lay had come to Taco Bell - removing any possibility of his idea having been appropriated. Reacting to his death, Taco Bell released a statement to say that Mills was a 'true friend of the Taco Bell family' and fondly remembered his 2012 visit as one of the first to try their greatest creation. One day: Mills helped to revolutionize the fast food landscape with his backing of the Doritos Locos Tacos . The snack and the campaign: The Doritos Locos Tacos has sold more than 600 million units nationwide and was helped by Todd' social media campaign that utilized people such as President Barack Obama . 'We are honored to have had his support through the Doritos for Taco Shells Movement on Facebook, and we admire his strength and optimism during his recent battle. Our thoughts and sympathies are with Todd's family during this time,' the company said in the statement. One of Mill's last Facebook posts, commemorated the launch of his dream with a nachos-flavored taco shell on the bridge of an aircraft carrier with a banner reading, 'Mission Accomplished' behind it - in reference to President George W. Bush's less successful attempt in 2003 to claim he had completed his task in Iraq. In one final comment to the Arkansas Times last year, Mills joked that although he was happy with the glory, 'If they wanted to send me a big taco check, that would be alright.'","Todd Mills, 41, hit upon the genius idea while watching television in 2009 .

"It was once the luxury brand beloved of the fashion elite. However, Mulberry has warned that its profits will come up short this year due to a drop in sales. The profits warning would have been unimaginable at the height of Mulberry’s success in 2011, when it was the fastest growing luxury brand on the planet. Scroll down for video . Warning: Luxury brand Mulberry is pinning its hopes on a new bag by model Cara Delevingne (pictured) Key to its success was the Alexa bag, named after model and TV presenter Alexa Chung and based on a man’s satchel. Mulberry’s former designer Emma Hill called the Alexa ‘the anti-It bag that became an It bag’ – and it became so popular that it once had a waiting list that ran into thousands and accounted for a third of Mulberry’s sales. Combined with the classic Bayswater, it saw sales at Mulberry soar and the brand was eventually valued at £1billion. But Mulberry has since struggled to come up with another hit on the same scale - with the launch of its Willow Tote and other designs failing to capture womens’ imaginations. It is now valued at just £340million. Popular: The firm's last big hit was a bag named for the model Alexa Chung (pictured) The bad news sent shares to a four-year low at one point yesterday, wiping 17per cent off the value of the Somerset-firm. The departure of creative director Emma Hill, who was widely credited for the success of the Alexa satchel, was a blow, and was followed by a failed attempt to take the brand more upmarket. It has since launched a range of cheaper styles and has been trying to replicate its success with Miss Chung by contributing with model of the moment Cara Delevingne this autumn. Executive chairman Godfrey Davis said: ‘As expected the first half has been difficult. ‘Profit before tax... is expected to be significantly below current expectations. ‘Despite the current challenges I remain confident that we build on Mulberry’s solid foundations.’ However, he said Mulberry’s fortunes have been on the up since the launch of Miss Delevingne’s line. Mr Davies said: ‘Following the launch of the Tessie bag family during June, we introduced a new family of bags developed with Cara Delevingne at the beginning of September. ‘The reaction to these bag families has been positive and they have contributed to the improving sales trends.’ At £795, there is a Mini Cara Delevingne Bag in black natural leather and this rises to the top end large Cara Delevingne Bag in Black & White Camouflage at £2,500. Inside there is small lion rivet and a heart shaped patch based on Cara’s heart tattoo. The model has said: ‘I want there to be hidden gems inside, based on things that are personal to me, which my tattoos definitely are.’ The next new product arrives in-store during November 2014 in time for Christmas, with the launch of the new Blossom tote bag, the Mini Lily and a new collection of small leather goods. The firm had previously reaped the benefits of its A-list association and its products became seen as investments which would keep their value. Celebrity fans included Victoria Beckham and Geri Halliwell, actresses Kate Winslet and Sienna Miller and models such as Claudia Schiffer.

"Mayor Michael Bloomberg shocked New York when he openly admired a woman's derriere as he mingled at an event. An author introducing himself to the politician along with a friend said the politician ignored them in favour of pointing out another guest's figure. The writer related the anecdote in a profile article on Christine Quinn, Speaker of the New York City Council and frontrunner in the upcoming mayoral election, published Sunday in New York Magazine. ‘My friend thanked him for his position on gun control,' wrote Jonathan van Meter. 'Without even acknowledging the comment, Bloomberg gestured toward a woman in a very tight floor-length gown standing nearby and said, “Look at the a** on her.”’ Partners in politics: City council Speaker Christine Quinn (left) is poised to be the frontrunner to take over Michael Bloomberg's job (right) when he leaves the role as New York Mayor after 12 years . The article doesn’t mention the name of the woman in question, but Ms Quinn gives some further description about how the Mayor likes the ladies around him to look. ‘The mayor is going to yell at me when I . get out of the car because I have flat boots on,' she told Mr Van Meter, in a separate anecdote in the story.  The mayor has no use . for flat shoes.’ Ms Quinn was sporting a new pair of soigné black English riding boots, which though stylish, she predicted would be a point of contention when she met with Mr Bloomberg later that day. ‘I was at a parade with him once and he said, “What are those?” and I said, “They’re comfortable,” and he said, “I never want to hear those words out of your mouth again,”’ Ms Quinn recounted. The criticisms don’t stop there, as she added that he also takes issue when the gray roots begin to show in Ms Quinn’s trademark flame red hair. ‘The couple of days a week before I need to get my hair colored, he’ll say, “Do you pay a lot to make your hair be two colors? Because now it’s three with the gray,”’ she said. Specific: It was revealed that Mayor Bloomberg doesn't like it when Quinn (seen center, with her wife Kim Catullo left) wears flat shoes, even at parades . But Mr Bloomberg is not the only one who can play the smart alec - Ms Quinn is known for her quick wit and Irish sense of 'telling it how it is'. ‘I’m like, “Did you wake up being this big of an a**hole? Or did it take, like, all day to ramp up to it to be able to insult me like that?”’ she retorted. Bloomberg, 69, is known for his outspoken comments. In 1996, three years after divorcing  his . Yorkshire-born wife Susan Brown, he told The Guardian: 'I am a single, straight billionaire in Manhattan. It's like a wet dream.' The pair married in 1975 and have two . daughters - Emma in 1979 and Georgina in 1983 - who featured on Born . Rich, a documentary about the children of the extremely wealthy. Bloomberg now lives with Diana Taylor, former New York . state banking superintendent, on the Upper East Side, and the couple regularly travel to his retreats in places like Bermuda and Paris. During his 2001 campaign, his opponents attacked him for supposedly fostering an atmosphere of hostility toward women at his company. He was criticised for his attitude towards women taking maternity leave. Picky: Another issue for Bloomberg is when Quinn has waited too long to get her hair dyed and her roots begin to show . Democrat Mark Green highlighted an incident in which he allegedly told a pregnant woman at his company to 'kill it' and allegedly added: 'Great, No. 16' - which she cited as reference to the number of pregnant women in the company at the time. He settled the case three years later, without an admission of guilt, for an undisclosed amount. Love life: Bloomberg, 69, with his partner Diana Taylor - who he lives with on the Upper East Side . The New York Daily News assembled a . harvest of other complaints, including those of women who alleged they had been urged to wear . their skirts shorter. After Bloomberg won the mayoral race, but before he was sworn in, New York magazine reported that he had a 'needlepoint pillow beside his bed [that] reads, ""How Many Heterosexual Billionaires Are There, for Crissakes?""' Joyce Purnick wrote in her book that one top aide had recalled: 'An attractive woman would walk into the bullpen and the mayor would say ""nice tits"" — he just couldn't help himself.' In 2009, he confessed that he had a crush on an English ‘honey’ – actress Honeysuckle Weeks. The politician was overheard telling another Englishwoman, editor and columnist Tina Brown, that he had 'fallen in love with' Ms Weeks after a friend sent him a complete collection of the drama Foyle’s War. He celebrated the New Year a month ago by kissing Lady Gaga in Times Square, shortly . after they had led the crowd in a final-minute countdown to midnight. But the mayor said afterwards: 'Lady Gaga is very charming. It was fun. I would be remiss if I didn’t also add to that that the best kiss of the night came after that from Diana.' Ms Quinn may have been unimpressed by what she describes as Mr Bloomberg’s ‘potty mouth’ during her tenure as Speaker and his lengthy three terms as mayor, but she had also earned his expected endorsement. To many, she is seen as the Bloomberg-approved candidate to take over when he leaves office after 12-years in power this November. The billionaire is not the only male politician to grant their seal of approval. The article also noted that former President Bill Clinton gave Ms Quinn a rave review at a 2006 fundraiser, when he said that his wife, then-New York Senator Hillary Clinton, had told him: ‘You will not believe how good this woman is… She’s even a better politician than you are.’","The woman was wearing a tight, floor-length gown, said an observer .

"It hardly does it justice to suggest that Michal Zyro’s last meeting with Scottish opposition was bittersweet. The Legia Warsaw midfielder scored in both legs of his club’s thumping 6-1 aggregate victory over Celtic in the Champions League qualifiers — only for his outstanding efforts to be rendered meaningless. It was the most painful of blows. The administrative error that saw Legia bring on the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski in place of Zyro for the final few minutes of their win at Murrayfield has entered the annals of footballing infamy. Michel Zyro of Legia Warsaw celebrates scoring against Celtic in the home leg of the Champions League tie . UEFA punished the Poles by awarding Celtic a 3-0 second-leg walkover, meaning Henning Berg’s side exited the competition on the away-goals rule. Zyro insists he is over that heartbreak but there would surely be an extra piquancy if he could now hurt Scottish hopes in the international arena. The 22-year-old is a member of the Poland squad preparing to take on Gordon Strachan’s side in Tuesday night’s vital clash in Warsaw. ‘I have strange memories of playing Scottish opposition,’ admitted Zyro. ‘Against Celtic at the start of the season it was great on the park — but a nightmare off it. I scored in both games so, personally, it was special for me. ‘What happened in the aftermath is something I try not to think about because it was a really unfortunate situation. But we can still take heart from the fact we played two super matches and beat a team such as Celtic 6-1. ‘I won’t think about what happened going into this game. It’s a different situation — different team, different players. It’s important for Poland to beat Scotland but that is for the national team to progress and not just for me. ‘We want three points to end this round of qualifiers. I can take confidence from my performances against Celtic going into this game but football is different. ‘The Europa League is different from the Champions League and international football is different again. At the moment I was told we were out of the Champions League, I felt terrible. Michal Zyro (right) slots comfortably past Celtic's Fraser Forster in the second leg in Edinburgh . ‘We did everything on the pitch to go through, which is our job and the fault was in the office. It was a mistake on paper, not on grass.’ Legia have won two out of two in their Europa League section so far, but can’t escape from thoughts that they could have been mixing it with the elite. ‘I watch the Champions League on TV and it’s crazy to think we were so close and it was taken from us,’ said Zyro. ‘But I am a young player and in a year or two maybe I can perform there. ‘It’s more unfortunate for the older players such as Marek Saganowski and others who might not get that chance again. Maybe next year. I am someone who looks forward, not back. ‘One match after we were out of the Champions League I forgot about it. Maybe there was a little bit of pain in the back of the head. It was harder for the office staff and fans who worked at the club for many years and dreamed of this but, as a player, you just focus on the next match.’ That now means Scotland, with Poland still in ebullient mood in the wake of Saturday’s historic 2-0 win over Germany. Adam Nawalka’s side have upset the order in Group D and have yet to concede a goal, having opened up with a 7-0 romp past Gibraltar. There is, however, little sign of that flawless start producing any complacency or over-confidence. Respectful assessments of the Scottish threat have been the norm. Michal Zyro is replaced by ineligible player, Bartosz Bereszynski, to leave the result rendered meaningless . Zyro continued that theme but also made it clear he regards the current Poland players as the best crop their nation has produced in quite some time. He is an example of the emerging talent. Linked with potential transfer interest from Celtic before their Champions League meeting, the midfielder is now on the radar of several clubs in the English Premier League. ‘This is an important game for us and maybe even more important than Germany because Scotland are one of our direct opponents for second and third place,’ insisted Zyro. ‘Scotland were unlucky against Germany.

"Paul Smith is desperate to secure a rematch with WBO super-middleweight champion Arthur Abraham following his controversial defeat to the German-based Armenian over the weekend. Abraham retained his 168lbs crown after a disputed unanimous decision victory over the British challenger in Kiel, Germany. Scores of 117-110, 117-111 and 119-109 did not seem to reflect a tight encounter and the result was met with scorn from several commentators. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Paul Smith: Judges scoring of Abraham fight stinks . Paul Smith walks away 'disgusted' after the match was awarded to the home favourite Arthur Abraham . Smith was inconsolable during the post-fight press conference following his defeat by the Armenian . The English boxer (right) is now demanding that he is given the chance to fight Abraham again . Smith told Sky Sports: 'It's just one of those things. The scoring was shocking but I  have to get on with it. It still hurts. It's still a loss but hopefully we can get the rematch.' The 31-year-old (35-4, 20KOs) may be heartened by a tweet from the WBO, which said: 'The #WBO is waiting to receive the assigned supervisor's report and replaying the fight before giving an opinion on #AbrahamSmith.' While overturning the result, or even deeming the bout a no-contest, would seem far-fetched, the sanctioning body could yet enforce a rematch by making Smith mandatory challenger. Smith has received some encouragement from the WBO, who sent out this tweet on Monday . The WBO could enforce a rematch  by making Smith mandatory challenger once they have reviewed the fight . Smith says Abraham (41-4, 28KOs) promised a return bout at the post-fight press conference and the Liverpudlian is hopeful the two-weight world champion will stick to his word. 'The best outcome for me is for the WBO to watch the fight, sort the judges out, get three neutral and competent judges in, make me mandatory challenger and put the fight up for purse bids. Let's do it again and have an immediate rematch,' he said. Smith gave a very good account of himself on Saturday and many have questioned the result . The judges voted unanimously in favour of Abraham, much to Smith's frustration and disappointment . 'He'll know in his head that he lost that fight and will he want to fight me again after that? I was meant to be a nice routine defence for him and I knew I wasn't. Everything I said I'd do before the fight I did it and I believe I should be sitting here with a world title. 'I spoke to Arthur in the press conference after the fight and I spoke to the promoter Kalle Sauerland. A translator said that Arthur said he'd fight me any time, so I leaned over and I said 'fight me next. Give me a rematch' and I put my hand out and he shook my hand. 'It's certainly not a contract but it's a gentleman's agreement. If he believes he'll fight me again, do it next - financially it'll make sense for him. He earned a lot of money fighting me and he'll earn even more this time. There's demand for a rematch now.'","Paul Smith was defeated by world champion Arthur Abraham on Saturday .

"Guests at the Cecil Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, drank, bathed in and brushed their teeth with water from a roof-top tank where a Canadian tourist's body floated, decomposing, for nearly three weeks. Authorities have confirmed that the body found in a tank on Tuesday is Eliza Lam, a 21-year-old University of British Columbia who disappeared on February 1. Police still don't know how Lam died or even how she ended up on the roof of the hotel - which is protected by locked doors and an alarm. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Los Angeles fire fighters peer down at the water tanks on the roof of the Hotel Cecil as they try to figure out how to remove the body of a young woman found inside . Tragic: Police have identified the body as Elisa Lam who disappeared on January 31 after taking a solo trip to Southern California from Canada . Found: Lam was found wedged in the water tank above the Cecil Hotel by a maintenance worker after guests complained of low water pressure . A police source told the Los Angeles Times that her death may have been accidental. Los Angeles Police detectives have . characterized her disappearance as suspicious, but have not released . details about she ended up in a closed-off cistern. Tourists staying at the run-down Skid Row hotel said they were shocked by the discovery of a body in the hotel's water supply. 'The water did have a funny taste,' Sabrina Baugh, a British tourist who used the water in the hotel for eight days, told CNN. 'We never thought anything of it. We thought it was just the way it was here.' Ms Baugh and her husband Michael said they were disgusted by the revelation. Crime scene: LAPD homicide detectives were on the scene to investigate the body . Investigation: Police are now working to determine if the woman's death was accidental or a homicide . 'The moment we found out, we felt a . bit sick to the stomach, quite literally, especially having drank the . water, we're not well mentally,' Mr Baugh said. Los Angeles County health officials . said they are testing the water to determine whether it is contaminated. The water in the tank where Lam was found feeds taps and showers in the . hotel rooms, as well as a coffee shop and the kitchen downstairs. 'Our biggest concern is going to be fecal contamination because of the body in the water,' Terrance Powell said. 'The water did have a funny taste. We never thought anything of it. We thought it was just the way it was here.' Sabrina Baugh, British tourist who drank water at the Cecil Hotel for eight days . The hotel built in the 1920s but . refurbished several years ago was the once occasional home to serial . killers Richard Ramirez - nicknamed the Night Stalker - and Jack Unterweger, responsible for the death of nine prostitutes in Europe and . the U.S. Police say there have been reports of continuing crime at the hotel. Investigators are now working to determine whether foul play was involved in Lam's death with an autopsy scheduled for Thursday. Law enforcement sources told the Times that a locked door and fire escape are the only ways to access the hotel's roof. The door, which only employees can reach, is also equipped with an alarm that notifies hotel staff if someone is up there. The water tank is also hard to access requiring authorities to work well into the afternoon to remove her body after a maintenance worker discovered it on Tuesday morning. 'The location of the water tanks is very small and configured in a very tight way so it's a little more difficult to get the body out,' said police spokeswoman Officer Sara Faden. A worker stands on a water tank on the roof of the Hotel Cecil where the 21-year-old was found . Luxury: The Cecil Hotel is a two-star hotel in downtown Los Angeles where Elisa Lam was staying during her visit to the city . Stange behavior: A surveillance camera on the elevator at the Cecil captured Lam acting in a peculiar, paranoid way  the night she vanished . Lam stayed in touch with her friends and family while traveling in California - up until the day she disappeared. A security video taken in an elevator . at the hotel and released by the LAPD last week showed Lam acting . strangely, hiding in a corner and repeatedly peering around the elevator . doors into the hallway. She never checked out of the hotel . positioned on the outskirts of Skid Row and employees said they never . saw her with anyone else. Her body was discovered in one of . four large water tanks after a maintenance worker went up to investigate . reports of low water pressure, a Los Angeles police spokeswoman said. Bernard Diaz, 89, who has lived at . the Cecil for 32 years, told the LA Times that he heard a 'tremendous' racket on his floor above him the night Lam disappeared. He said the floor also experience flooding that night. Travels: Elisa Lam, seen center, was a student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and visiting Southern California on her own . Area: Police say there have been reports of continuing crime at the hotel built in the 1920s but refurbished several years ago . 'They said there was some obstruction to the drain between the third and fourth floor,' Mr Diaz told the Times. Some two dozen firefighters could be . seen cutting through one of the four large, cylindrical water tanks . under a canopy that shielded them from news helicopters overhead. Police have said that the reason for . Lam's visit to Los Angeles was unclear, but that her final destination . was expected to be Santa Cruz in central California. She speaks Cantonese as well as English and was known to use public transportation such as trains and buses.","Police have identified the victim as Elisa Lam, 21, who traveled to Southern California on her own late last month .

"Robert Lewandowski has warned his Poland team-mates their historic win over Germany will count for nothing if they slip up against Scotland. The Bayern Munich superstar set up the clinching goal for Sebastian Mila as Adam Nawalka’s side caused a Group D sensation by defeating the world champions 2-0 in Warsaw on Saturday evening. It was Poland’s first-ever victory over Germany at the 19th attempt and leaves them in a powerful position ahead of Scotland’s visit to the Stadion Narodowy on Tuesday evening. Robert Lewandowski (L) has warned his Poland teammates not to get complacent after beating Germany . Sebastian Mila wheels away after scoring the second goal in Poland's first ever win over Germany . Lewandowski believes, however, that the match against Gordon Strachan’s side is the most important part of their Euro 2016 double-header. And he is adamant that only another triumph will suffice in their bid for automatic qualification. ‘We made history against Germany, but it’s still only three points,’ insisted the 26-year-old striker. ‘If we lose against Scotland, we will have only picked up three points from the two matches and that’s not enough. Poland players celebrate after rewriting the history books with a 2-0 victory over Germany in Warsaw . Robert Lewandowski's attractive wife Anna watched the Euro 2016 qualifier from the stands . ‘There is no secret that Germany will win this group easily and our biggest rival for second place is Scotland. So that’s why it is so important we beat them on Tuesday. ‘I thought we were very effective against Germany. Okay, we did not create many opportunities, but when we had those chances, we took them. ‘We have to take a great deal of confidence from that - that’s what happens when you beat the world champions. ‘Possibly, we gave Germany too much respect at first, but with each passing minute, I thought: “Hang on, we can win this match and make history”. And we did.’ Wigan midfielder Shaun Maloney scored the winning goal in Scotland's dominant display against Georgia . Polish FA president Zbigniew Boniek echoed Lewandowski’s thoughts as he demanded full focus on the threat presented by Strachan’s side. ‘We had several excellent individual performances against Germany and the rest of the team fought fiercely for this result,’ said the former Juventus and Roma great. ‘But now it is time for the match against Scotland. Let the fans enjoy Saturday’ s victory, and savour it. Our players do not have the time to do that. ‘We cannot think we are now great, because it is not true. We will stay humble and concentrate on a difficult match against the Scots.’","Poland defeated Germany for the first time in their history after 2-0 victory in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Warsaw .

"New European featherweight champion Josh Warrington can match Ricky Hatton's level of popularity as his career gathers pace, according to promoter Eddie Hearn. Warrington continued his rise to prominence in his home city of Leeds by stopping Davide Dieli in the fourth round to add the European title to his British and Commonwealth straps. Arguably more impressive than his performance was the raucous reception afforded to the 23-year-old at the First Direct Arena, which took even Hearn by surprise. Josh Warrington can match Ricky Hatton's level of popularity, according to promoter Eddie Hearn . The promoter is convinced his young charge can capture the imagination of the city - as former two-weight world champion Hatton did in Manchester during his career. 'We've got something major here,' said Hearn, who revealed beforehand that Warrington had personally sold close to 2,000 tickets himself. 'I've not seen anything like that. Belfast and Glasgow are wonderful cities but you don't see a thousand people taking their shirts off and swinging them over their heads. 'This is the kind of support Ricky Hatton had back in those days, it's fanatical. It's not just 'let's go to Leeds and watch some boxing'. It's about one person, it's about Josh Warrington, it's a fanatical support and that means so much to someone's career.' Hearn said he was impressed with Warrington's relationship with the crowd, comparing him to Hatton . It has been a whirlwind 12 months for Warrington, who gained his first stoppage win as a professional in his 16th fight against Samir Mouneimne in November last year to capture the Commonwealth title before winning the British title by outpointing Martin Lindsay in Leeds in May. And following his latest triumph, Warrington (19-0, 3KOs) said: 'I couldn't really predict what would have happened 12 months ago. It's been a real rollercoaster ride. 'Picking up the Commonwealth, British and now European (titles) has been unbelievable but I'm loving every minute of it.' Warrington started strongly on Saturday night and gained reward for outworking his foe when a straight right put down Dieli in the fourth round before a barrage immediately after prompted the referee to halt the contest. Warrington beat Davide Dieli in the fourth to add the European title to his British and Commonwealth straps . 'I kept my gameplan until I knocked him down and after that it went out of the window. I smelt blood and went for him. There was no stopping those arms from going,' Warrington added. On the undercard, Ricky Burns made a winning start on his light-welterweight debut but was thoroughly uninspiring in a points win over lightly regarded Frenchman Alexandre Lepelley. The former two-weight world champion would have been hoping to make his mark in the 140lbs division after back-to-back defeats at lightweight and although the Scot put his French opponent down in the first round he largely struggled thereafter. The 23-year-old Warrington's record is now an impressive 19-0 with three knockouts . The 31-year-old Coatbridge fighter recorded his 37th win from 42 bouts in the eight-round contest but may now move back down to lightweight. Brian Rose bounced back from his world title setback with a first-round stoppage against Ignacio Lucero Fraga. The Blackpool fighter, who was beaten by WBO light-middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade earlier this year, floored his Argentinian opponent three times for a confidence-boosting victory. Hot prospect Callum Smith continued his rise up the ranks by claiming the 14th win of his professional career with a third-round TKO of Rafael Sosa Pintos.","Josh Warrington can be the new Ricky Hatton .

The 49ers delivered a late goal-line stand as they avoided their first three-game losing streak under fourth-year coach Jim Harbaugh, containing the league's top passer in Nick Foles. He threw two incomplete passes from the 1 in the waning moments. On a day the 49ers (2-2) gave up big plays on special teams, Gore came through. Colin Kaepernick also threw a touchdown pass to Stevie Johnson and Phil Dawson kicked four field goals.

Brees led two scoring drives early in the fourth quarter to cut a 31-3 deficit in half before the Cowboys regained control. Dallas (3-1) is tied with Philadelphia for the NFC East lead. The Saints (1-3) couldn't sustain the momentum from their win against Minnesota and lost to the Cowboys in Texas for the first time since 1991.

DeMarco Murray steps into the end zone for one of his two touchdowns on the night as Dallas defeated New Orleans 38-17 at the AT&T Stadium . Baltimore Ravens 38 Carolina Panthers 10 . Steve Smith punished his former team with seven catches for 139 yards and two touchdowns. Smith spent 13 seasons with Carolina before he was released in a cost-cutting move during the offseason. The 35-year-old receiver showed the Panthers he can still make the big play, scoring twice in the second quarter to help put Baltimore (3-1) in front 21-7 at halftime. The first touchdown came when Smith grabbed a pass that deflected off the right hand of teammate Owen Daniels. He caught the ball in stride and took it into the end zone to complete a 61-yard play. Smith also scored from 21 yards with a diving reception. Joe Flacco went 22 of 31 for 327 yards and three touchdowns, the other a 24-yarder to Torrey Smith.

They racked up 358 yards after being held to 223, their lowest total since 2008, a week earlier in a 19-7 loss at Detroit. They intercepted Jay Cutler twice in the third quarter to pull away from the Bears (2-2).

The rookie was 19 for 30 with no turnovers and ran five times for 27 yards and a score in his first career start, but his last carry was costly. His left foot rolled underneath him as he was sandwiched by two tacklers at the 1-yard line. Matt Asiata powered his way in on the next play for his third touchdown, and Bridgewater stayed in to zip a crisp pass to Rhett Ellison to push the lead to 35-28. As Bridgewater was taken away on a cart for X-rays, Christian Ponder took over at quarterback for the Vikings (2-1).

Bridgewater was later forced from the field with an ankle injury though his contribution of 317 yards was pivotal in the Vikings' victory . Houston Texans 23 Buffalo Bills 17 . J.J. Watt had another highlight-reel play to help the Texans overcome a tough day offensively. Houston (3-1) was down by three in the third quarter and Ryan Fitzpatrick had just thrown a second interception when the 6-foot-5, 289-pound Watt returned an interception 80 yards to put the Texans up 14-10.

Jeremy Ross and Eric Ebron caught scoring passes for the Lions, who are 3-1 for the second straight season. Stafford finished 24 of 34 for 293 yards. Johnson, who was in and out of the game, was clearly impeded by his injured ankle. He had just two catches for 12 yards. Golden Tate had a big game, catching eight passes for 116 yards. A struggling Geno Smith had two more turnovers as chants of ""We Want Vick!"" echoed throughout MetLife Stadium at times. The Jets, who made it close on Chris Johnson's 35-yard run with 6:58 left, fell to 1-3 for the first time in Rex Ryan's six seasons as coach.

"A British woman has been locked up in a notorious jail in Iran – for trying to watch a men's volleyball match. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was arrested and taken to Tehran's Evin jail a few days after attempting to watch a volleyball match between Iran and Italy on June 20. She has spent 41 days in solitary confinement, according to her family. Ms Ghavami went to the Azadi Stadium – which ironically means 'freedom' - with other women to protest against Iran's stricture, introduced after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, forbidding females to attend male sporting events.

Detained: Ms Ghavami was arrested after trying to watch a men's volleyball match at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran (pictured) At first Ms Ghavami, who is studying law in London, was arrested then released, but when she went back to fetch her belongings, she was re-arrested and jailed. Several others involved in the demonstration were also detained. Her brother, 28-year-old Iman Ghavami, told ITV News: '[The family] can barely hold themselves together. 'They are torn apart – not just my parents but my grandparents, my uncles, everybody.'

Social media campaigns have sprung up in a bid to pressurise Iran into releasing Ms Ghavami. There's a Facebook group dedicated to helping her and the hashtag #FreeGhonchehGhavami is being appended to Twitter posts about her plight. The Foreign Office said it was aware of the situation, but has little sway over Iran as it does not have official diplomatic ties with it, so it's unlikely to be able to help Ms Ghavami. Amnesty International UK spokesperson Neil Durkin told MailOnline: 'We're extremely worried about Ghoncheh's predicament. 'She's been held in solitary for over a month in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison where she's been under the control of the country's Revolutionary Guards. 'Her lawyer has had no access to her or any documents about why she's being held, though we understand she's being investigated with a view to charging her with the extremely vague offence of ""propaganda against the state"". 'Ghoncheh is a prisoner of conscience and should be released immediately.' Iran's rigid enforcement of Islamic code is down to the influence of its top authority, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who this week successfully underwent prostate surgery, according to Iranian state media.","Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was arrested and taken to Tehran's Evin jail in June .

"Newly-crowned Man of Steel Daryl Clark wants to join the exodus to the NRL but Warrington fans can breathe easy. The 21-year-old Castleford hooker, who on Wednesday night completed the rare double by being named Super League young player of the year as well as Man of Steel for 2014, has signed a four-year contract with the Wolves but revealed he has ambitions to test himself in Australia. Six members of the 24-strong England squad - in which Clark was named last Sunday - currently ply their trade in the NRL and fellow hooker Josh Hodgson will stay on after the Four Nations Series to take up a two-year contract with Canberra Raiders. Daryl Clark and girlfriend Leigh at the gala dinner at Old Trafford cricket ground on Wednesday night . 'I’m a massive fan of the NRL,' Clark said. 'I watch pretty much every game. 'I’ve got them on series link and I watch them on my days off through the week. 'One day I would like to go there and test myself but I want to establish myself in Super League first. Maybe in a few years’ time.' Clark capped a memorable season for his club by scooping the major honours at the Man of Steel awards dinner at Old Trafford cricket club, where his boss Daryl Powell was named coach of the year. It was a fitting way for him to bow out of his home-town club but, before he can link up with Warrington as the replacement for Michael Monaghan, Clark will face a new challenge on the international stage. He was always likely to go on tour after his stellar domestic season but is set to be England’s first-choice hooker following the withdrawal of James Roby. Daryl Powell (left) was named Coach of the Year and Clark was Young Player of the Year and Man of Steel . The St Helens hooker, who wants to give his injured ankles time to fully recover in the off season, was on the Man of Steel short-list, along with prop forwards Jamie Peacock (Leeds) and Chris Hill (Warrington), but took time out at the awards night to wish his successor well. 'He wished me luck and said he hopes we go over there and play well,' Clark said. 'They are big shoes to fill. He’s been outstanding for a few years. 'I’m just looking to go there and enjoy it. It’s something new for me, I’ve never been involved with the England set-up.

"John Quinn, who launches an attack on both the English and Irish Cesarewitch this weekend, believes he has found a reason for top two-year-old The Wow Signal running way below his best in the Prix Jean Luc Lagardere at Longchamp on Sunday. Quinn runs Swnymor, whose odds with Ladbrokes have halved in the last week to 12-1, at Newmarket on Saturday and will saddle Triumph Hurdle fifth Rutherglen in Sunday’s Irish Cesarewitch at the Curragh.

"England's Oliver Wilson will take a three-shot lead into the final round of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, but world number one Rory McIlroy is one of the Englishman's nearest challengers. Wilson, who has finished runner-up nine times on the European Tour but lost his card in 2012, carded a third round of 65 at St Andrews to finish 15 under par. But on a day of low scoring following a one-hour delay due to heavy overnight rain, McIlroy shot a 64 and Tommy Fleetwood a 62 on the Old Course to finish 12 under alongside French duo Alexander Levy (68) and Raphael Jacquelin (69). England's Oliver Wilson leads the way on 15 under par at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship . He has a three-shot lead of the chasing pack going into the final day on Sunday . Wilson is ranked 792nd in the world and a lowly 102nd on the Challenge Tour rankings, but a win on Sunday would be worth almost £500,000 and a two-year exemption on the European Tour. 'I'll be nervous,' admitted Wilson, who played on the 2008 Ryder Cup team. 'It's a big day for me. Last year I got off to a great start here and kind of fizzled out. 'But the way I played the last two days, I left so many putts out there and I'm still at the top. So that gives me a lot of belief, but tomorrow will be a very different day. But that's what we play golf for, to get in those situations and test yourself. I am looking forward to it. 'I've had the belief for a while, I've just needed a little bit of adrenaline to be honest. I've been flat all year for various reasons and to get the opportunity to come here and play is very nice and I guess I come to a tournament like this with a bit more dynamism.' McIlroy found himself nine shots off the lead after struggling to an opening 73 at Carnoustie, one of the three courses used for the pro-am event. But the four-time major winner bounced back with a 67 at Kingsbarns on Friday and carried on where he left off at St Andrews, a course he ""hated"" on his debut in 2005 but which is now a favourite and the place where he will defend the Open Championship next July. He birdied five holes in a row from the third and also picked up a shot on the ninth to be out in 30 and move into the lead. That lead did not last long as Wilson chipped in for an eagle on the fifth and also birdied the sixth, but McIlroy responded with birdies on the 11th, 12th and 14th before dropping his only shot of the day on the 16th, where he needed two attempts to play out sideways from a fairway bunker. Rory McIlroy faces a uphill battle if he is to claim victory at St Andrews . The Ryder Cup hero is three behind after shooting eight under on Saturday . 'I got off to a really fast start and was trying to keep it going, and I sort of did through the turn, but the last four holes weren't really what I wanted,' said McIlroy, who has finished second twice, third and eighth in five appearances in this event. 'But any time you shoot a score like that around St Andrews, you have to be happy. I got myself into contention going into tomorrow and my dad (his amateur partner) and I are going to get to play St Andrews on his 55th birthday tomorrow which will be a huge treat for both of us. 'Shooting a 59 never really crossed my mind. What did cross my mind was wanting to beat my previous best score round here of 63 (in the first round of the 2010 Open).'","England's Wilson leads by three going into final day at St Andrews .

"Fabio Borini is happy at Liverpool and wants to try and force his way into Brendan Rodgers' thinking this season, according to the player's agent. The Italian turned down moves to Sunderland, where he spent the previous season on loan, and QPR in the summer despite being told his first-team chances with the Reds would be limited. Striker Fabio Borini (left) is committed to Liverpool despite making just one start this season . Borini has made just one start and two substitute appearances, one of which came in the Champions League against Ludogorets, but his agent Marco de Marchi said there were no plans to look at moving him on. 'At this moment I am certainly not going to look for another club, as the boy is happy to remain at Liverpool,' he said. Striker Borini snubbed chance to return to Sunderland, where he spent the previous season on loan . 'Let's not forget he left a journey he already started at Roma in order to come to England.

Borini continues to be linked with other clubs, including a number back in his homeland, but De Marchi stressed there was nothing in the pipeline. Borini had been told by manager Brendan Rodgers (above) that his first-team chances would be limited . 'Borini is a top-level player, so consequently he has a contract with Liverpool and any club interested knows how to approach them,' he told FcInterNews.it.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini admits he is baffled by UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. City were fined £49million and restricted to spending no more than that in this summer's transfer window after UEFA found them to be in breach of the regulations, which impose an upper limit on clubs' monetary losses. Their European squad was also cut to 21 players instead of the standard 25. Pellegrini told national newspapers: 'I really do not understand what Financial Fair Play is. For me it is impossible. Man City manager Manuel Pellegrini has admitted UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules have left him confused . UEFA sanctions on City included a £49m fine and a reduction in their Champions League squad . 'This is a club that does not have a pound of debt to anyone. I understand that if you have a big debt you don't pay, you have to be punished, but I do not understand exactly what is Financial Fair Play.' Despite the cap on their summer spending, City signed £32m defender Eliaquim Mangala from Porto - and have yet to play the France international, with Pellegrini preferring Martin Demichelis alongside captain Vincent Kompany. 'We thought we needed a good defender but not necessarily in the month of August or September,' said the manager. 'We needed a young defender and we thought Mangala was the correct player. City signed defender Eliaquim Mangala from Porto for £32m over the summer . 'We will see when he starts playing. He will play but he does not have to play immediately. It is four months without him playing a game but why must we start him immediately when we have two good defenders?' Meanwhile, goalkeeper Joe Hart admits he has had no talks with the club over a possible new contract. The England international is tied to the club until the end of next season but, while he has been first choice so far this term, he faces competition from summer signing Willy Caballero. Joe Hart, who was exceptional in City's match with Bayern Munich in midweek, has revealed he has not yet been offered a new contract . Hart has also seen the likes of David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Kompany sign new deals but has had no hint he is next in line. 'If a new contract is on offer then it's news to me,' he said.

"Wayne Rooney's hopes of claiming England's fifth goal in the romp against San Marino have been dashed by referee Marcin Borski. The Polish official has recorded it in his match report as an own goal and UEFA have awarded it officially to Alex Della Valle, who now has two for England, the same as Andros Townsend, who also found the net at Wembley. Rooney's chipped shot-or-cross from an angle on the England right clipped Della Valle on the chest, swerved over goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini and landed in the net. Wayne Rooney (right) crosses the ball in for England and San Marino's Alex Della Valle deflects it into the net .

He scored the second in the 5-0 win against San Marino from the penalty spot and stands fourth in the goal charts, two behind Jimmy Greaves and further adrift of Gary Lineker (48) and Sir Bobby Charlton (49). Roy Hodgson was hoping it would go down to his captain and give him a boost before the trip to face Estonia on Sunday. 'I would give it Wayne Rooney, all day,' smiled Hodgson, after the San Marino game. 'But the record won't play on his mind. He's 29 later this month and we'd like to think with the way he is and the footballer he is that he has a few years in him yet. 'There are plenty of games left. I don't think we should put any pressure on him to reach targets early. The important thing is he keeps playing well and doing a job for the team and working hard, as he did. Della Valle (left) has now scored two own goals against England, having also netted in March 2013 . Rooney celebrates after scoring the second goal on an extremely comfortable night  against San Marino . San Marino's Alex Della Valle scored his second own goal against England on Thursday evening, having already netted in the Three Lions' 8-0 victory away in March 2013. Della Valle has now scored more goals than 12 of the outfield players in the England squad - including Raheem Sterling (0),               Adam Lallana (0) and Jack Wilshere (0). 'He got in a lot of times. His runs were very good. He's a bit disappointed with the chip he missed, because he thought it was on, but I'm more than happy with him. It was another good captain's performance, solid throughout.' Rooney did not have the same good fortune with the referee as Gareth Barry, three years ago. With England on 1,999 goals, there was much interest generated in who would score the 2,000th goal, ahead of a friendly against Sweden. The only goal of the game skidded off Barry's face and on to the head of Swedish defender Daniel Majstorovic before it flashed into the net. On that occasion, however, the referee gave it to Barry, who will forever be in the record books as the scorer of a landmark goal.

"France's Raphael Jacquelin claimed the halfway lead in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Friday as the luck of the draw had a major impact. Jacquelin carded a second round of 70 in the pro-am event to finish nine under par, one shot ahead of Irish duo Shane Lowry and Padraig Harrington, England's Oliver Wilson and France's Alexander Levy. Eleven of the top 12 scores came from players who were at Kingsbarns on Friday and Carnoustie on Thursday, when calm conditions meant traditionally the hardest of the three venues played relatively easy. Raphael Jacquelin claims halfway lead at Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on nine-under-par . Rory McIlroy is five behind Jacquelin after 36 holes of the pro-am tournament in Scotland . Wind and rain made scoring more difficult on Friday but Jacquelin birdied his final two holes to move into pole position for a fifth European Tour title. 'I'm pretty happy, especially the way I finished,' said Jacquelin, whose last win came in a record-equalling nine-hole play-off in the Spanish Open last year. 'I birdied 17 and 18 so it was good before having dinner and going to rest. 'I've been working hard every year since the last 20 years to be at this position. I feel good. It's a long weekend. It's a lot of golf to play, so you know, the game of golf, it's not that easy. You just have to stick to the same plan and see what happens.' Lowry, who finished joint third in this event 12 months ago, was the only player in the top 12 to play at St Andrews on Friday, meaning he will face Carnoustie on Saturday before the final round is again played over the Old Course. 'To be honest, the way I played to shoot two under was quite good,' said Lowry after a round containing four bogeys and six birdies. 'The forecast was pretty bad today and everyone was expecting the worst, but it wasn't actually that bad. 'It played quite easy toward the end and I could have picked up a couple more, but I'm happy with the position I'm in with two rounds to go. Hopefully I can go out to Carnoustie tomorrow and hopefully the weather is not too bad over there and I can shoot a decent score.' Harrington won the first of his back-to-back Open titles at Carnoustie in 2007 but has not won a tournament on a major worldwide tour since the 2008 US PGA. The four-time major winner (right) finished his round strongly to give him an outside chance of victory . The 43-year-old was a vice-captain at last week's Ryder Cup and although he admits he has a lot more to learn before bidding to captain the side, he has set himself an ambitious target. 'I think the big one for me, I've got to get inside the top 15 in the world to make the Olympics in 2016,' said Harrington, who is currently ranked 324th. 'I've got 22 months to go. I'm starting at absolute zero probably at the moment. 'I really feel good about my game, so I believe I can do it.' Scottish duo Richie Ramsay and Chris Doak are two shots off the pace on seven under, with compatriot Stephen Gallacher another shot back and Gallacher's Ryder Cup team-mate Rory McIlroy five off the lead on four under. Jacquelin has benefitted from having a favourable draw in nice conditions at Carnoustie and Kingsbarns . McIlroy, who is keen to make the cut in the team event so his amateur partner, his father Gerry, can play at St Andrews on his 55th birthday this Sunday, started the day nine shots off the pace and dropped back to two over par with a bogey on the 14th. However, the world number one responded in style with a superb fairway-wood approach to the par five 16th and rolled in the eagle putt from 15 feet on his way to a round of 67 at Kingsbarns. 'I think the eagle on 16 kickstarted something for me,' the 25-year-old said. 'I just went from there, started to knock a few putts in. I felt like I struck the ball pretty well for the first couple of days, but just to see a few putts roll in sort of gave me a little bit of confidence and played well after that. 'It would mean an awful lot to win at St Andrews. But if I didn't, I wouldn't mind waiting until July next year.' That is when the Northern Irishman will defend his Open title.

"Even now, three years on, Martin Johnson struggles to comprehend his dramatic demise as England manager and the controversial events that preceded his resignation. He has regrets, but also a lingering sense of defiance. The 44-year-old World Cup-winning captain kept the lowest of profiles since his fall from grace following England’s scandal-ridden failure in 2011. But now he has spoken for the first time about the events that led to the end of his tenure. ‘Looking back at it, of course I would have done things differently,’ he said. ‘We can all do that. You do what you think is right at the time, that’s all you can do. We could all say we’d go back and change things. Martin Johnson  looks on during an England Rugby World Cup 2011 training session in New Zealand . England's poor campaign in New Zealand was blighted by off-the-field problems . Chris Ashton and other World Cup stars went to a 'dwarf-throwing' event during a night out in Queenstown . Manu Tuilagi was fined for jumping off a ferry into the water in Auckland .

October 2: Johnson reprimands three players for making inappropriate comments to a female hotel worker. October 9: Manu Tuilagi is formally warned by police and fined £3,000 by England rugby officials after jumping from a ferry in Auckland. ‘We got caught out off the field. We were aware of what could happen and warned the players, but it still happened. We warned the players about it and you think you’ve covered it, when maybe you haven’t covered it. Maybe you have to say it every day. ‘The difficult thing is that it gets perceived as something that it wasn’t really. I’m not saying that things didn’t happen, but I’m saying the perception is that that was the only thing that happened. That became the story rather than the rugby, and that’s what gets remembered. ‘In 2003, once you’ve won the World Cup, everything is portrayed as being great and a perfect working machine. But of course it wasn’t; we were all human beings, we all made mistakes, had our frailties and did similar things that the boys did in 2011. It just didn’t get to that level and didn’t get recorded. And then you win, so everything is all right.’ What is clear is that the episodes in New Zealand which left him in an untenable position have left deep scars. On his watch, in the midst of a high-profile event, England’s reputation was tarnished by unseemly episodes off the field — primarily the infamous dwarf-tossing night out in Queenstown after an opening pool-stage victory against Argentina. Caught in the eye of a storm, Johnson made the mistake of playing down the matter, with his notorious ‘rugby player drinks beer, shock’ remark. Martin Johnson has broken his silence after England's disappointing Rugby World Cup in 2011 . Johnson has defended his team but admitted: 'We all make mistakes' Having stubbornly refused to strike a remorseful tone, Johnson’s position was further undermined as England blundered from one crisis to another; from inappropriate behaviour towards hotel staff, to illicit match-ball swapping, to Manu Tuilagi’s dive off a ferry into Auckland harbour. By the end of that World Cup, as his side were dispatched by France in the quarter-finals, the manager cut a shattered and forlorn figure. His resignation followed, as did the knife-twist of leaked reports which provided a damning postscript — with players criticising many aspects of the England regime. Though the dust has long since settled and the national team has been revitalised on the back of Stuart Lancaster’s overhaul of personnel and culture, Johnson still believes he and his regime were, in part, victims of what he considers to be false perception. ‘It wasn’t actually a true reflection of those people and what we were about,’ he said ‘But you’re fighting a tidal wave almost at that point because everyone “knows” what’s happened because they’ve read about it. ‘People start telling me what it was like when I was there — that’s the battle you have to win. That was my mistake; you have to win that battle as well. It’s almost like a sales job.’ England players watch on during a quarter-final defeat by France in Auckland . Delon Armitage and Sean Lamont battle for the ball in a pool B match . Tuilagi was caught up in off-the-field controversy during the competition . Johnson and captain Lewis Moody chat during a training session in Takapuna . During his tenure as England manager, Johnson presided over a record of 21 wins, 16 defeats and a draw in 38 Tests. Yet, for all the criticism which came his way at the end, he was at pains to emphasise the fact that he presided over the country’s only Six Nations title success since 2003, along with the introduction of several players who have become stalwarts of the Lancaster regime. ‘People go, “It was a disaster at the World Cup”, but England have won one Championship in the last 11 years and that was in 2011,’ he said. ‘We won 10 out of 13 games that year and we did OK. ‘Ultimately, we brought through a lot of players who had a successful start to their career, although we were criticised for not doing that. ‘Dan Cole, Alex Corbisiero, Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Ben Youngs, Chris Ashton, Ben Foden and Manu Tuilagi all came through. In 2008-09 there was a lack of guys who were really putting their hands up to play Test rugby. We did start bringing some through and they played well.’ His words suggest that the subject of his legacy is another scar — another perception issue. While Lancaster implemented a revamp of the England with an influx of youth, Johnson makes plain that he had laid some of the ground-work. He has stayed quiet for so long, but now he has stuck his head back above the parapet, to try to set the record straight. Johnson is a Mastercard ambassador for the 2015 World Cup .

"Neil Lennon held further talks with Bolton on Saturday as they drew closer to appointing a new manager. Lennon had been poised to speak to Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia but is understood to have met Bolton owner Eddie Davies in he hope of securing a deal with the Championship strugglers. Currently propping up the English second tier after winning just one league game this season, Bolton have been looking for a new manager since parting company with Scot Dougie Freedman last month. Neil Lennon held further talks about the vacant manager's job at Championship strugglers Bolton . Lennon has been away from football’s front-line since leaving Celtic in May after a successful four-year spell. He was due to travel to Saudi Arabia this week for talks on the vacant Al-Ittihad post but visa problems meant he and his backroom staff were unable to travel to Jeddah. Whilst a remuneration package of over £2million per year was attractive, Lennon had reservations at moving to the Middle East in any event in terms of his career development. The challenge of firstly securing the Trotters’ place in the Championship before building for promotion is far more appealing and there’s every chance he could take the team for the first time at Birmingham next week.

"Eddie Hearn will hold a crisis meeting with Team Sauerland just hours before Paul Smith takes on Arthur Abraham after the two teams failed to agree which gloves will be worn for the world title fight. The disagreement occurred during the routine rules meeting which took place after the weigh-in on Friday afternoon in Germany. WBO super-middleweight champion Abraham selected the 10oz Everlast 1910 model for Smith to wear, even though the Liverpudlian prefers to wear Grant gloves since breaking his hand in his fight with George Groves in 2011. Paul Smith's promoter Eddie Hearn has revealed there has been a dispute over which gloves shown be worn for his fighter's world title bought after reigning WBO super-middleweight champion Arthur Abraham . The two fighters face off at the weigh-in in Kiel ahead of Saturday's fight for the WBO super-middleweight title . It is understood that the selected gloves seemed much bigger than the favoured Grants, which would not have helped Smith in this fight because of his punch power. It is common place for a champion to select which gloves will be worn but Smith and his team were not happy with the model and style selected at the meeting. Now promoter Eddie Hearn has arranged for three different models of Everlast gloves to be couriered out from England overnight – and Abraham must choose one of them. The two teams will now be forced to meet once again at midday on Saturday – just 10 hours before the boxers are due in the ring – to resolve the problem and finally select which gloves will be worn. Sportsmail columnist Hearn said: 'Abraham requested that we wear Everlast 1910 gloves. These were not of a style we have seen of that particular model before. 'Paul was not happy with the design or the quality of the glove selection. We are happy for Arthur to select gloves for Paul but had requested that Paul wear Grant gloves, as he has done for the majority of his recent fights. Paul Smith (right) looks determined at the weigh-in in Kiel ahead of his first world title fight on Saturday . Arthur Abraham (left) stands in the way of Smith (right) for the WBO super-middleweight title . 'When you're given an opportunity, like we have been by Abraham and his team as a voluntary defence, you have to accept certain things. One of them was that he selected the gloves and we have no problem with that. 'Abraham insists that Paul wears Everlast so we have couriered out three other models for Abraham to inspect in the morning. Fighters clearly need to protect their hands and also be comfortable, particularly in a fight of this magnitude. 'We'l meet in the morning, not trying to be difficult, we're just protecting our fighter. He needs to be comfortable with the gloves for a fight of this magnitude.' The situation is reminiscent of Floyd Mayweather's first fight with Marcos Maidana back in May, when champion Mayweather took exception to the gloves his opponent was planning to wear. The Argentinean wanted to wear the Everlast MX, known as a glove favoured by big punchers, which had been customised to the blue and colours of his nation's flag. But Mayweather and his CEO Leonard Ellerbe said there was not enough padding on the glove and eventually Maidana was forced to wear the softer Everlast Powerlock glove.","Sportsmail columnist Eddie Hearn has revealed there has been a disagreement over which gloves should be worn for the world title bout .

"The pot wasn't real. Neither, admitted Floyd Mayweather  was much else that went on in the cable television shows promoting his latest fight. Not the joint rolling parties with a bevy of female friends in his Las Vegas mansion. Not the 31 minute fights without a break in the 'Dog House' of his gym just off the city's glittering Strip. Not even the betting that went on between Mayweather and others over who was going to win. Floyd Mayweather admitted that the 'reality' TV show building up to his fight with Marcos Maidana was made up . Mayweather (centre) won the fight by a unanimous verdict but had to explain the show to boxing regulators . 'I don't want to just sell a fight,' Mayweather said. 'I want to sell a lifestyle.' Called before Nevada boxing regulators on Tuesday to explain what went on in the Showtime All Access shows aired earlier this month before his rematch with Marcos Maidana, Mayweather said it was all just made-up entertainment to sell the fight. It worked, he said, bringing in enough of an audience for him to sell more pay-per-views for a fight in which he was guaranteed a $32 million payday. 'It wasn't real marijuana,' Mayweather said. 'It's all about entertainment.' Mayweather, who earlier this year was licensed as a promoter in Nevada, was summoned by Nevada State Athletic Commission Chairman Francisco Aguilar to explain scenes in the All Access show that ran a few days before the fight. Mayweather is listed as the executive producer of the show, which bills itself as a reality series filming boxers before their bout. Mayweather said the show was 'all about entertainment' and was simply a vehicle to interest people in the fight . Turns out it wasn't so real after all. 'It's a new generation, a young generation,' Mayweather said. 'We believe in going outside boxing and doing something different. Because we did something different we got better pay-per-views this time around.' Showtime does not release pay-per-view buys but various reports say the rematch with Maidana did slightly better than the first fight, which did not reach 1 million buys. Mayweather's fight last year with Canelo Alvarez was boxing's richest, drawing some 2.2 million buys. Mayweather appeared before the commission with longtime adviser Leonard Ellerbe and one of his attorneys. Notably missing were his normally large entourage and the very imposing bodyguards who usually trail him everywhere. Aguilar and the other commissioners were most interested in two fights shown on All Access which was presented as going on for more than a half hour without break, ending only when the beaten boxers quit. On the show, Mayweather is shown arranging the bouts and cheering the fighters. 'The dog house - the rules are you fight till whoever quits,' Mayweather said on the show. The regulators were satisfied with Mayweather's explanations about the reality TV programme . Appearing before the commission, though, Mayweather said the fighters got three to four long rest breaks during the sparring sessions. 'We do take breaks when we spar. I make sure,' Mayweather said. 'I'm not going to let anyone get hurt because safety is very important to boxing.' Attorney Shane Emerick said scenes showing cash exchanging hands in bets on the fight also didn't happen, and Mayweather knows gambling in the gym is illegal. He also said Mayweather doesn't smoke marijuana or drink alcohol, and wouldn't be around second-hand marijuana smoke because it could show up in drug tests for the fight. Mayweather explained that he did not bet on his fights or smoke marijuana as suggested in the show . Mayweather is shown in All Access at his mansion while joints are being rolled and smoked. At one point he tells an assistant to go get some more rolling papers. Commissioners said they were happy with Mayweather appearing before them, and satisfied with his explanations. 'You accomplished your goal,' Aguilar said. 'I think you represented yourself well.' Asked as he was getting on an elevator to leave why anyone would want to watch the show if they knew it was all staged, Mayweather smiled and said: 'You know I love you guys. Keep up the good work.'","Floyd Mayweather was the subject of reality TV show All Access prior to fighting Marcos Maidana earlier this month .

"Their football is often the very definition of artistic but Barcelona have been playing like 'machines' this season, according to Monday's edition of Mundo Deportivo. The Catalan sports daily hails deadly duo Lionel Messi and Neymar, who astonishingly have played a hand in 19 of Barcelona's 22 goals this season. They were at it again on Saturday, scoring within 78 seconds of one another in a 2-0 victory at Rayo Vallecano. Mundo Deportivo describes Barcelona as 'machines' as Lionel Messi and Neymar inspired yet another win . Messi's goal carried him to within just two goals of the Spanish league goalscoring record, held by Athletic Bilbao legend Telmo Zarra, who scored 251 during the forties and fifties. Neymar has now scored seven goals in seven league matches so far, only two less than he managed in 26 matches last season. Sport, meanwhile, hail goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who is 'the safest in Europe' after setting a new La Liga record for not conceding during the first 630 minutes of the season. He broke the previous benchmark of another Barcelona goalkeeper, Pedro Maria Artola, who went the first 560 minutes of the 1978-1979 season without conceding. Happiness at Real Madrid, too, after they thrashed Athletic Bilbao 5-0 at the Bernabeu to move within four points of Barca. Sport praises Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who has yet to concede a league goal this season . The front cover of Marca described their performances as a 'cyclone' as Real move from 'thrashing to thrashing.' They add that the 'BBC' of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema are 'building an irresistible Madrid.' The Portuguese scored his 22nd league hat-trick, equalling the record shared between Zarra and Alfredo Di Stefano. It is his third treble in four league matches. Benzema, who scored the other two, is hailed by Ronaldo as 'the best striker in the league.' Marca describes Real Madrid's 5-0 win over Athletic Bilbao as a 'cyclone' and features Cristiano Ronaldo .

Ronaldo certainly thought so, saying afterwards: 'Maybe this is our complete match. We are getting better.' Sunday night's big match between title contenders Juventus and Roma dominates the Italian front pages. 'Juve joy, Roma rage' says Gazzetta dello Sport after the champions' 3-2 win, secured thanks to Leonardo Bonucci's spectacular late volley. Meanwhile, Roma doyen Francesco Totti caused controversy after claiming Juventus will always win 'by hook or by crook' after they were awarded two debatable penalties. Juve director general Giuseppe Marotta blasted back, saying his allegations were 'unacceptable,' adding 'we haven't stolen anything.' Gazzetta dello Sport concentrates on the big match in Italy, as Juventus beat Roma 3-2 on Sunday night . The row also dominated the front page of Corriere dello Sport, whose headline reads: 'Distorted title'. Juve's two penalties were given despite the fouls possibly being outside the area, while their manager Rudi Garcia was sent to the stands. 'Juventus boss it' say Tuttosport, who add that 'everything happened but the champions end the happier.' Arturo Vidal can expect a fine, they say, after reports of a confrontation in a nightclub late on Thursday night, which meant he was late to training the following morning. Corriere dello Sport focuses on Francesco Totti's comments that Roma were denied victory by the referee .

"It is a statement on the size of Sir Ben Ainslie’s challenge that the Duchess of Cambridge’s husband is the great, great, great, great-grandson of the Queen who first watched Britain lose what became known as the America’s Cup. That was on the misty Solent in 1851 when Queen Victoria asked who was in second place. ‘Your Majesty, there is no second,’ she was told. The schooner America, which saluted the Queen by dipping its ensign three times, beat the Royal Yacht, winning a victory for the new world over the old and ending Britain’s supremacy of the seas. Will to win: Sir Ben Ainslie is desperate to win the America's Cup for Great Britain . Patriotic: Ainslie turned down more lucrative offers to lead a team representing Great Britain . We have not won the America’s Cup from that day to this. So on Tuesday in Greenwich — in the appropriately august setting of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, and accompanied by the Duchess of  Cambridge, herself a keen sailor — Ainslie launched his team for the 35th America’s Cup by saying: ‘We want to right a wrong and bring the Cup back to British waters for the first time. That is our goal. 1851 The first edition of the America’s Cup, making  it the oldest international trophy  in sport . 0 No British team has won the America’s Cup . 90 The typical number of staff on an America’s Cup team . 3 The qualifying rounds to determine which team faces Oracle Team USA will take three years . 62 The boat used in the final match will be a 62 foot catamaran, crewed by eight sailors . ‘As a country we have won the World Cups in rugby and football, Wimbledon, the Tour de France, but this is the last great historic prize never won by Great Britain.’ Ainslie’s desire to win the Cup for Britain caused him to turn down lucrative offers — potentially worth £2million — to compete as a hired hand for one of the other competitors, as he did when he helped Oracle Team USA to their astonishing 9-8 victory from 8-1 down last year. ‘There were other teams on the markets and we did have a few discussions,’ he  said, ‘but I wanted to do this as a British skipper, not for any other country.’ He also feels a deep personal motivation. He has been entranced by the America’s Cup since, when aged 12, he saw Victory 83, the yacht owned by Peter de Savary, ‘I dreamed about doing this and read all the books about it,’ he said. The prize itself, the 4ft tall silver Cup, which is known as the Auld Mug and is kept in the New York Yacht Club, was flown to London in its own first class seat. A guard even slept with it overnight. In the Greenwich sun, it was handled carefully by two men in white gloves and placed between Ainslie and the Duchess for the photographers to capture. Launch: Ainslie announced his intentions alongside the Duchess of Cambridge in Greenwich . Missing piece: Ainslie claimed the America's Cup was the last historic prize never won by GB . To try to win it for Britain, Ainslie is pulling together an £80million bid drawn from private and  commercial sources. Part of that fortune is in place or underwritten; the rest, he hopes, will follow. Sir Charles Dunstone, the Carphone Warehouse founder, and Sir Keith Mills, the entrepreneur who was instrumental in bringing the Olympics to London, have  contributed to the fund. Both are avid sailors and were involved in the last — aborted — British bid in the guise of Team Origin. Ainslie’s cache as the most decorated Olympic sailor in history, has helped him to poach some impressive crew members. They include the powerful Kiwi Jono Macbeth, who has won the Cup three times — the first man Ainslie phoned as he assembled his star cast. As well as another New Zealander, Andy McLean, British sailors David Carr and Nick Hutton, both of whom competed in the event last year, and Matt Cornwell, the world match race champion, are in place. Carr was particularly pleased that the Duchess complimented him on his thick-rim glasses. ‘She said it was a good look,’ he reported afterwards. Select band: Ainslie's team is made up of Jono Macbeth, Andy McLean, David Carr, Nick Hutton and Matt Cornwell . The protocol, as the rules are known, stipulate that 25 per cent of the eight-man crew must be  British. That is at least an improvement on the last staging of the event, when there was no eligibility regulation at all. ‘I’d like as many British guys involved as possible,’ said Ainslie, though he is aware — as are  Dunstone and Mills on the  commercial side — that to succeed they must embrace the inter-national possibilities open to them. The design team is crucial for an AC62 wingsail catamaran. Ainslie will draw heavily from Formula One to get every aerodynamic advantage he can. These boats travel 10 miles in 25 minutes. In 1851 it took them 11hr 37m to circumnavigate the Isle of Wight. What next? The British bid is likely to be based in Portsmouth. Their racing programme in the America’s Cup World Series in 2015 and 2016 will include about six events a year. There will then be a qualifying series in 2017, from which a challenger will emerge to take on Oracle in the America’s Cup Match itself. And the name of the boat? Ainslie said he will write Rita —the moniker he gives to all his crafts — in Tipp-Ex somewhere  unobtrusive for tradition’s sake, but the official name is likely to be grander. The Duchess, perhaps. Location, location, location: The Camber Docks in Portsmouth are the proposed site for Ben Ainslie Racing .","Sir Ben Ainslie wants to add America's Cup to Great Britain's sporting haul .

"Sir Ben Ainslie will call upon Adrian Newey, the greatest Formula One designer of his generation, to help him win the 35th America's Cup for Great Britain. Sportsmail understands that Newey will have a hand in designing the state-of-the art catamaran as the upshot of an ingenious deal announced yesterday by his current employers Red Bull, by which he will remain involved in F1 while taking on a wider brief with the soon-to-be-launched Red Bull Technology Projects. Newey's new 'multi-year' contract also ends Ferrari's interest in signing him, despite an offer of £23million a year. New role: Adrian Newey, seen here congratulating Daniel Ricciardo after his win, has agreed a multi-year deal . Going for gold: Newey met with Ainslie at last year's race in Abu Dhabi . His Red Bull extension is not thought to be as lucrative as that, but it gives him what he wanted: flexibility to pursue new challenges in an environment he enjoys. Newey, 55, had made no secret of his desire to be involved in the America's Cup and he met Ainslie at last season's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to discuss the possibility. The issue that needed to be resolved was how he could honor his commitment to Red Bull yet take up Ainslie's offer. The resolution, to contribute under the aegis of Red Bull Technology Projects, comes ahead of tomorrow's official launch of the British America's Cup team at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich – an event that will be attended by the Duchess of Cambridge. Ainslie, 37, has managed to secure funding worth about $100million to take on the holders, Oracle Team USA. Sir Charles Dunstone, the Carphone Warehouse founder and Sir Keith Mills, the entrepreneur who helped bring the 2012 Olympics to London, are among the investors. Red Bull's Technology Projects enterprise will create new engineering jobs and develop plane, car and boat technology. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who brought Newey to Red Bull in 2006, said: 'It's great we've come to an agreement and that Adrian's going to continue to be advising and mentoring the team going forward. Some exciting new projects will be announced in due course. 'We've got tremendous strength in depth. It's not like he's not going to be about any more.'","Red Bull announced that Newey had signed a new multi-year deal on Sunday .

"To put into perspective how young Jordan Rossiter is, he was just 18 months old when Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, to whom he has been compared, made his first-team debut. The 17-year-old midfielder is now the second youngest goalscorer for Liverpool following his strike against Middlesbrough and he started playing football at an early age, too, when he was around three or four. He has been at the club’s academy since he was six and he grew up an Everton fan (not that that should unduly perturb any on the Kop, seeing as Robbie Fowler, Jamie Carragher and Ian Rush were all boys in blue before starring at Anfield).

Liverpool's youngest ever goalscorer is Michael Owen, who scored on his Premier League debut against Wimbledon in May 1997 at the age of 17 and 143 days. Rossiter was 17 and 183 days when he netted against Middlesbrough. He captained Archbishop Beck Sports College to Echo Cup victory in 2011 and a year later made his debut for Liverpool’s Under 18 side in a 4-3 defeat by West Brom - on his 15th birthday. But it was his performance in the 4-1 victory over Inter Milan in the NextGen series in 2013 the really caught the eye and prompted Robbie Fowler to tweet that he is ‘potentially the next Stevie G’. That is high praise indeed and he captained the Under 18s in 2012-13 when he was just 16 before moving on to the Under 21s last season, for whom he played 19 times. He won Liverpool Academy Player of the Season in May after being named on the first-team bench twice, against Chelsea and Hull. He signed his first professional contract in March and impressed in a brief pre-season appearance at Preston .

"Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is known for displaying a t-shirt with 'why always me?' splashed on the front of it after scoring for Manchester City against Manchester United - but maybe he should change his catchphrase to 'why always three'.

Reds manager Brendan Rodgers has heaped praise on his £16million signing by saying he has the potential to become world-class - but has warned the 24-year-old he must show a higher level of consistency. 'I think Mario is potentially world-class,' said Rodgers. 'You can't compare Luis Suarez and him, but Mario is coming in as an international striker and he's a talent, no doubt. 'Suarez elevated himself, that was clear. He wasn't world-class when he came in but when he left to go to Barcelona he had put himself in that bracket. 'He did that because of his consistency in scoring goals and keeping his performance level high. World-class is about being at the highest level consistently, being at that level in your game consistently. That's what takes you there. ' Balotelli is expected to be included in Liverpool's starting line-up to face Everton on Saturday afternoon with team-mate Daniel Sturridge likely to start on the substitutes' bench after recovering from a thigh injury.

"Carlo Ancelotti believes Real Madrid can make history by becoming the first team to retain the Champions League. Real finally won their tenth European crown last season after a 12-year wait, beating rivals Atletico Madrid in the final, and the Italian manager is aware of the difficulty of repeating the feat.

The La Liga champions sealed a routine win over the visitors with first-half goals from Koke and Saul Niguez, as well as a penalty from Raul Garcia and a goal in the closing stages from Raul Jimenez, securing Madrid's fourth win in six games. The impact of Diego Simeone on the sidelines for the hosts couldn't go unnoticed either, as the Atletico boss marauded the troops and fans alike, after returning to the dugout for the first time after completing his eight-game ban.

Atletico continued to put the pressure on Sevilla - who in contrast were showing no real attacking threat - and then doubled their lead just before the interval. Widely renowned for their efficiency from set-piece Madrid showed exactly just why as they doubled their advantage as they capped off an excellent team move.

Elliott Bennett delivered a fine cross from the left but Northern Ireland international Kyle Lafferty, completely unmarked, somehow headed over. Defender Ignasi Miquel was then also too high with a header from a Bennett corner but Shrewsbury matched Norwich for long stages and grew increasingly confident as the first half developed. Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro, set free by a lovely pass from Liam Lawrence, unleashed a drive which was straight at goalkeeper Declan Rudd, then the French striker also fired just wide from 20 yards following a skilful run.

"Nani's disappointing return to Sporting Lisbon continued as he was involved in a bizarre incident which saw a team-mate sent off. Sporting drew 1-1 with unfancied Belenenses, their third stalemate in four games so far this season. But the main talking point come when on-loan Manchester United winger Nani and Jefferson tried to forcibly remove an injured Belenenses player from the pitch, who they believed was playacting deep into stoppage time. The Sporting players tried to lift their opponent by the wrists and ankles but the referee failed to see the funny side of it, giving Brazilian defender Jefferson his marching orders after brandishing a second yellow card.

"In England, Chelsea have blasted their way to the top of the Premier League. In Spain, Barcelona are already a few strides ahead on their quest to regain the La Liga title. In Italy, Luis Garcia's rising star Roma team are sitting pretty in first place. At the top of the Bundesliga, these European giants are joined not by Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund or Schalke, but by lowly SC Paderborn 07. We are only four games into the new Bundesliga season but Paderborn's rise to the top of the division is still remarkable. Just 10 years ago, this tiny club was playing in the regional league. Paderborn's Moritz Stoppelkamp celebrates after scoring his side's second goal from 90 yards on Saturday . Paderborn's coach Andre Breitenreiter celebrates with his team after their 3-0 victory over Hamburger SV . Paderborn fans may even have expected to be bottom of the Bundesliga but they've done incredible so far . When they achieved promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in their history last May, many expected them to remain rooted to the bottom of the table for a year. But their start has been explosive. Four games, two draws, and two wins, including a 3-0 thrashing of Hamburg. This is a club from a town of only 150,000 people. Their Benteler Arena stadium has a capacity of just 15,000, with only 5,000 of those in seated areas. When they line up against  Munich on Tuesday night, the entire market value of Paderborn's squad will be at about £20million – about half the value of Thomas Muller. And yet it is Bayern who are quaking in their boots. Munich legend Franz Beckenbauer said this week that 'Bayern are only slight favourites, and that's only because they're playing at home,' while Pep Guardiola didn't hesitate to express his admiration for Paderborn. 'We know why they are at the top of the table. They play aggressively. They have no pressure on them. It's not a surprise.' Paderborn's success story has been led by two figureheads. The first is club president Wilfried Finke, a local furniture magnate who has pumped money into the club for nearly two decades. Paderborn's Moritz Stoppelkamp controls the ball with his chest on the edge of his own area on Saturday . Stoppelkamp smashes the ball from 83 yards in the direction of the Hamburg goal . The Hamburg keeper watches forlornly as the ball rolls into the goal . Finke is characterised first by a slightly ruthless leadership, but also by an impressive football savvy. His managerial appointments have almost all been successful, with many, such as Jos Luhukay and Roger Schmidt, going on to bigger clubs. The latest in that line is current coach André Breitenreiter. A far cry from the cult of the individual which surrounds Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, Breitenreiter is a measured, considered manager. His tactical flexibility and his players' mentality have been the foundation stones for the team's early success. 'We don't have a specific system, it is always about working out the best way to play against a certain opponent,' says Breitenreiter. 'I know that our boys go out together in the evenings, and that shows that this isn't about 10 or 12 players playing well, it is about the whole team.' For while individual players such as Elias Kachunga and Moritz Stoppelkamp have stood out for the goals they have scored, it is the team effort which has set Paderborn apart. As they line up against Bayern on Tuesday evening, they know they are light years behind in terms of individual quality. But if they play as fearlessly as they have done so far, a shock result is no longer too hard to imagine. Pep Guardiola will face current Paderborn coach André Breitenreiter on Tuesday night at the Allianz Arena .

"Darrell Clarke choked back the tears on the final day of last season when Bristol Rovers were relegated from the Football League. The man in charge stifled sobs as he fronted up following their defeat by Mansfield. He had been Rovers manager only since March, having arrived as assistant in 2013, but insisted it was his fault they were dropping out of the League for the first time since their inception in 1920. Andy Monkhouse celebrates his goal to bring Bristol Rovers level at 1-1 in Saturday's Conference clash with Aldershot at the Recreation Ground . Matty Taylor celebrates his goal to put Rovers 2-1 ahead in the Conference match, which ended up 2-2 . A section of the 1,255 Bristol Rovers fans who made the 200-mile round trip to Aldershot on Saturday . Rovers, who dropped out of the Football League for the first time since 1920 at the end of last season, have been getting used to the more rustic surrounding of the Conference . Rovers quickly sold out their initial allocation of 800 tickets at the Recreation Ground and 1,255 fans travelled in total as they continue the long and winding road back to the League . ‘The club has changed massively since then,’ said Clarke after his side’s 2-2 draw at Aldershot on Saturday. ‘I’ve got players who are proud to wear the shirt again.’ Clarke has been ruthless, releasing 11 players and transferring nine. He then scoured the lower leagues and non-League, bringing in 11 new faces. The overhaul does not stop there. Chairman Nick Higgs is working on a deal to sell Rovers’ Memorial Stadium to Sainsbury’s to fund a new all-seat arena near to the University of West England’s Frenchay campus. That would almost double crowd capacity from 12,011 to 21,700 but the deal has repeatedly been delayed. Higgs remains confident — though getting the club back into the League is crucial to filling the new ground.

Rovers fans queue patiently for the turnstiles to open in the run-up to kick-off at Aldershot . Fast food stalls serve up burgers, chips, hot dogs and candy floss to the travelling hordes . It's apparently an unwritten rule that all food bought at the football must be covered in the appropriate sauce . Cambridge thumped bitter rivals Oxford United 5-1 in Saturday’s League Two thriller at the Abbey Stadium. The away side took an early lead, Danny Hylton heading Oxford in front in the ninth minute, but Kwesi Appiah scored twice just before half-time and Cambridge stretched their advantage with goals in the second half from Ryan Donaldson, Tom Elliott and Robbie Simpson. The signs are good. The support Rovers have maintained since going down has been remarkable. The average home gate this season is still 5,639, far eclipsing the Conference average. For Saturday’s game Rovers sold their allocation of 800 tickets and brought 1,255 in total for the 200-mile round trip. Until then Aldershot had averaged gates of just 1,984. Rovers fans filled the corner of the Recreation Ground — now known as the Electrical Services Stadium — sharing it only with a horse chestnut tree and a few police officers. Two relegations in four seasons is tough on any team and losing League status can be catastrophic. But Rovers fans have stood firm. ‘If fans were put into league tables, ours would be in the Premier League,’ Clarke said. Many of those in blue and white preferred refreshment of a different kind at the local La Fontaine pub . Rovers fans have remained loyal to their side despite the bitter disappointment of last season's relegation . Mark Phillips of Aldershot (centre) and Adam Cunnington of Bristol Rovers contest a header . Press officer Keith Brookman, at the club for 14 years, said: ‘We’ve been amazed by their loyalty, especially after we only won one point from our first three games.’ That so many travelled to Aldershot, where tickets for the press are handed out from a car boot, is testament to their love of the club. They went home with a hard-earned point, their trip spoiled by a brilliant 25- yard free kick by Aldershot’s Jordan Roberts in the 77th minute. The home side took an early lead when Brett Williams converted a 16th-minute penalty, but Rovers looked likelier winners when they turned the game around.

This young supporter seemed pleased that Rovers took a share of the spoils . Three minutes before half-time Andy Monkhouse looped in an equaliser and Matty Taylor stroked a penalty into the bottom right corner on 68 minutes. When Rovers’ Adam Cunnington headed against the crossbar in the second half, 500 pairs of hands went to 500 heads in the standing section. Aldershot were reduced to 10 men in added time when Roberts was sent off for a second yellow card but there was no time to take advantage. Still, the point kept them fourth in the Conference, four points behind leaders Barnet. ‘The target is to go straight back up,’ Clarke said. ‘But that’s easier said than done. It took Luton six years. ‘I’m managing a massive club, but it’s only a massive club because of the supporters. We have to help the players manage the expectations. The fans expect us to go up, and I expect us to go up.’","Bristol Rovers dropped out of the Football League last season for the first time since their inception in 1920 .

"Zambia has lifted a ban on safari hunting after it caused financial problems for the country. The 20-month ban was imposed in January 2013 over allegations of corruption in the awarding of government hunting concessions, and amid fears for the future of the country's population of big cats. 'We lost too much revenue following the ban on hunting and the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) had a lot of financial problems,' said tourism minister Jean Kapata. Big cats: Sadly, for some tourists, the appeal of hunting these animals is greater than viewing them . ZAWA spokesperson Readith Muliyunda said in a statement that the ban on the hunting of lions and leopards remained in place. 'Hunting will be conducted under laid down conditions and strict supervision from ZAWA. But the ban on big cats still stands,' Muliyunda said. The southern African country, home to magnificent wildlife and the world-famous Victoria Falls, hopes to develop a wildlife tourism trade, which has long been a mainstay of the economies in neighbouring countries. At the time the ban was imposed, the former tourism minister Sylvia Masebo said: 'We do not have enough cats for hunting purposes. The cats are gone.' ZAWA had opposed the ban, saying it would be bad for the tourism industry. 'The population of cats in Zambia is around 3,400 to 3,500, and with the ban on safari hunting for cats we are likely to lose on revenue,' said ZAWA's head of research, Chuma Simukonda. 'It is these cats that make Zambia's safari hunting competitive in the region,' he said. Home to the world famous Victoria Falls, Zambia hopes to develop its wildlife tourism trade . Only 55 felines were hunted a year, he said, though the income from the sport was unknown. Shortly before the ban was imposed, ZAWA's director and senior officials were fired for alleged corruption in the awarding of safari hunting concessions. The country's hunting community saw the ban as political meddling. 'Blood sport is more beneficial to this country than game viewing,' said Gavin Robinson of the Professional Hunters Association. 'People from Europe and America wish to hunt here but they will now move elsewhere, meaning all the clients will leave Zambia,' he added. Conservationists, however, had welcomed the ban. Paul Goldstein, a photographer and travel guide with Exodus, who specialise in tours to the area, said removing the ban was 'deplorable'. 'If an old animal is dying of starvation and on its last legs and someone pays thousands of dollars to shoot it, then with those funds the community is able to build schools, repair park fences and employ wardens, it has to be looked at,' he said. 'However, this is seldom, if ever, the case. Permits are handed out willy-nilly to whichever ethically derelict hunter can afford the fat fee, so desperate they are to put the trophy on their wall. Someone in government gets a fat pay off from these canned hunts and the rest turn a blind eye.' 'Cats bring in money from tourism, unfortunately the pernicious desires of a few corrupt greed-heads just steepens the predators descent into oblivion.'","Ban imposed after allegations of corruption and fears for big cat population .

Since then, he has had a wonderous lifestyle exploring the world's art capitals. Ety, who documents every trip on her blog Cerbero On The Road, takes pictures of her pet at every opportunity. From soaking in the bright lights of downtown New York to sipping on a beer in Germany, Cerbero, who sometimes has to hide in a specially made bag when passing through 'dog un-friendly' countries, is a constant on Ety's travels. She said: 'Travelling is so much more fun when it's with Cerbero. 'Many countries are very nice with dogs, but some countries, like Mexico, just don't accept them anywhere; so we have to hide him.

"Original Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker may have just arrived in Ireland for filming, but locals and Unesco are not happy about cast and crew using the island of Skellig Michael as a location. A row has erupted over the filming of the latest Star Wars film on the protected island off Ireland’s south-west coast. Unesco has voiced concerns that cast and crew - including original Skywalker actor Mark Hamill - are disrupting wildlife on the barren outpost, while tourists and local boat operators are angry that they have been banned from visiting the site. Iconic Skellig Michael: Environmentalists are upset because they are unable to check on the birds . Unesco is trying to use its force to find out who authorised the secretive film shoot and a two-mile exclusion zone around the island, which has had protected status since 1996 because of its monastic ruins. Boats and other sea vessels have been told not to sail close to the island for three days as the filming takes place, but hundreds have flocked to the sleepy village of Portmagee to catch a glimpse of the Star Wars cast. Unesco has asked Ireland’s government to produce a report explaining the decision to allow Star Wars Episode VII to take over the rocky island that rises out of the Atlantic Ocean. In town: Cast and crew are in Portmagee, Ireland, from where they are being escorted each day to the island . Protected: The Sat Wars crew have taken over Skellig Michael for filming in recent days . In response to concerns, the Irish Film Board said permission was granted for a limited shoot after an extensive scientific analysis by the country’s National Parks and Wildlife Service. It said experts are on the island to watch out for any issues involving wildlife. Environmentalists, including Birdwatch Ireland, are worried because filming is taking place in the middle of breeding season for native birds. They fear the crew’s presence will threaten rare birds and they are upset because they are unable to get onto the island to check on puffins, cormorants, guillemots and other birds that live there. Secretive: Unesco claims it is not interested in who is filming but does want to know who gave permission . Puffins are one of the varieties of birds that live on the rocky island that rises from the Atlantic Ocean . Unesco, meanwhile, has expressed its own concerns about the impact on wildlife and the preservation of the heritage site. Roni Amelan, of Unesco headquarters in Paris, said: ‘We can't speculate what the filming of Star Wars on the site will do to the wildlife. ‘We just know that this is going on and we have asked for information.’ Located 12km off the coast in County Kerry, the island has been closed off to tourists as the film crew operates under a veil of secrecy. As an Irish Navy vessel patrols the waters, sci-fi fans are gathering nearby in Portmagee, a normally quiet village, to try to catch a glimpse of the stars. A helicopter used for the film shoot lands in a field near the sleepy village of Portmagee . Directed by JJ Abrams, Star Wars Episode VII will see the original stars of the series – Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher – reprise their iconic roles. Filming of principal scenes has also taken place at Pinewood Studios in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. With a reported budget of nearly £115 million, Star Wars Episode VII is expected in cinemas in December 2015.","Skellig Michael island has been a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1996 .

"Stephen Hunt, 38, is believed to have died after being engulfed by some kind of 'super heat' Two teenage girls have been arrested over the death of a fireman in a massive blaze at a hair products warehouse. The fire is thought to have been started by youngsters smoking cigarettes and discarding them. Former soldier Stephen Hunt, 38, was among 60 firefighters sent to tackle the inferno at Paul’s Hair World in central Manchester. He is thought to have been enveloped in a cloud of ‘super-heat’ caused by steam or chemicals. He and another fireman were pulled from the building and taken to hospital. Mr Hunt, the father of two teenagers, was pronounced dead, while his colleague remains in hospital. Two 15-year-old girls who were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter have been bailed until September pending further inquiries. A police source confirmed that youngsters may have been smoking behind the building moments before the fire started. Mr Hunt’s family paid tribute to him, saying: ‘Stephen was an old-fashioned gentleman with manners that are rare in this day and age, with core values which included loving his family, being the best father that he could be, loving and affectionate to those that were close to him. ‘Stephen lived to serve his country having served for seven years in the Royal Signals and then becoming a firefighter, which was a career that he was very proud of. ‘The whole family will miss spending time with Stephen, none more so than his son, daughter and grandmother. We loved his sense of humour and are very proud of him and what he brought to our lives.’ Scroll down for video . Firefighter Stephen Hunt has died after he was pulled from the wreckage of a wig shop in Manchester . Mr Hunt and a colleague got into difficulties shortly before 9am but he later died in hospital . The fire broke out on Saturday . afternoon in a basement store-room at the warehouse, which supplies hair . extensions and hair products. Witness Ava Smart said: ‘People came . running outside. I asked them what happened and they said someone was . standing out the back smoking. ‘It happened so fast. It was horrendous.’ Owner Paul Barnett desperately tried . to tackle the blaze with an off-duty fireman, but both were overcome and . were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation. Store manager Nicola Purcell said: ‘They did everything they could with extinguishers and water until the fire brigade arrived. Staff from Paul's Hair World arrive with tributes, at the scene of the fire in Manchester . The fire service are still tackling the blaze and said the complex layout of the building has hindered efforts . The fire broke out at Paul's Hair World on Saturday afternoon and more than 60 firefighters were sent to the scene . ‘Paul wasn’t well enough to come down today but wanted to pay his respects and asked the staff to lay flowers.’ The fire spread rapidly and around . five hours later at 8.30pm a ‘BA emergency’ was declared – a signal for . everybody to evacuate the building. Steve McGuirk, Manchester’s county . fire officer, said: ‘We had some real problems. This was a building . stacked full of hair products, chemicals and a huge amount of . combustible materials. ‘For some reason we don’t know, the . situation rapidly deteriorated and we took the decision to evacuate the . building.  It was during this evacuation that two firefighters  were . pulled out by colleagues. First aid was given and they were whipped off . to hospital, but tragically Stephen was declared dead on arrival.’ Fire service paid tribute to Mr Hunt (not pictured) and his colleague's 'professionalism and courage' He said Mr Hunt appeared to have been enveloped by ‘an absolutely massive, ferocious and sudden build-up of heat’. He did not rule out that it may have . been generated by steam or chemicals inside the building. He added: ‘We . are devastated by the loss of one of our colleagues in the line  of . duty. ‘It brings home the dangers that our firefighters put themselves in every day to keep the community safe.’ The fire was still being damped down . yesterday, while flags at fire stations all over Greater Manchester flew . at half mast, including the one at Philips Park where Mr Hunt was . based.

"Grief: Georgia Nah says she is struggling to come to terms with the deaths of two of her children from the Ebola virus . An American mother has told of her heartbreak after losing two of her children to the Ebola virus in the space of less than three weeks. Georgia Nah's son Patrick Sawyer, 40, became the first American citizen to be killed by the virus when he died in Lagos, Nigeria on July 25. Just a few weeks earlier he had been at the bedside of his sister, Princess Nyuennyue, 27, who was hospitalised in Liberia, where she lived with her fiancée and son. Ms Nyuennyue died on July 7, a day after her brother visited her. Hospital officials did not test her for Ebola until after her death – meaning Mr Sawyer had no way . of knowing he had been exposed to the virus. Speaking from her Philadelphia home Mrs Nah said she was struggling to come to terms with her children's death. She told NBC 10: 'I can’t stand it. I can’t sleep. 'Every day I think about them. I didn’t even know she was sick. My children were good children.' Mr Sawyer, who worked for the Liberian Finance Ministry, was planning to return . home to Coon Rapids, Minnesota, for two of his daughters' birthdays in . August, fell ill on a flight from Liberia in West Africa. Ms Nyennetue has been buried in Liberia. Mr Sawyer’s family are still trying to have his ashes flown to the states.

Nearly 1,000 people have died so far in West Africa in what is believed to be the worst outbreak of Ebola in history. Symptoms of the disease are similar to those of flu, and include fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and finally bleeding and death. There is currently no vaccine or cure for the virulent disease, which has ravaged parts of West Africa and killed more than 900 since its outbreak in March. The virus is spread by close contact with an infected person through bodily fluids such as sweat, blood and tissue. A memorial service for both of Nah's children will be held in Philadelphia Aug. 23.

"Stressed: Nurses should never have to care for more than eight patients at once, draft guidelines say . Nurses should never again have the 'dangerous' task of caring for more than eight hospital patients at a time, a major report will warn the NHS next week. The guidelines - drawn up in the wake of the damning inquiry into deaths at Stafford Hospital - could mean thousands more nurses have to be hired to save patients suffering due to a lack of staff. But despite warnings that they should be a bare minimum, the new measures would still be flexible depending on the needs of each hospital. And one nursing campaign says a one-to-eight ratio is not enough, with one-to-four the ideal target. The draft measures were drawn up at the government's request by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The one-to-eight ratio refers to both day and night shifts but the guidelines will focus most urgently on overnight care in acute adult hospital wards, a NICE spokesman said. These are the shifts where some of the most shocking under-staffing has been revealed. Figures obtained by the Royal College of Nursing in November showed some stressed nurses had cared for up to 22 patients each on night shifts at Hemel Hempstead and Watford General, both part of West Hertfordshire NHS trust. At Hinchingbrooke hospital in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, meanwhile, there was one nurse for 21 patients and there was one for 16 patients at Colchester Hospital, in Essex. The draft report is due to be released on Monday, 194 years to the day after the birth of Florence Nightingale. A NICE spokesman said: 'It recognises that if . each registered nurse is caring for more than eight patients regularly during the day, there is an increased risk of harm.' Lead nurses on wards will be told to watch out for 'red flag events', which include patients not being given medicine, asked about their pain or helped to the bathroom - and a single one should indicate the ward needs more staff. That system would be used instead of the . government ordering compulsory numbers or targets, which NICE warned . could become a maximum rather than a minimum on which to improve. Protest: But some union members say a one-to-eight ratio is still not safe enough (pictures posed by models) Professor Gillian Leng, NICE's deputy . chief executive, described the measures as 'an important step forward' but added: 'There is no floor or ceiling number on the . required number of nursing staff that can be applied across the whole of . the NHS. 'Assessing patient needs [is] paramount when making decisions about the number of nursing staff, . and planning should allow for flexibility on a day-to-day or . shift-by-shift basis.' Yet Susan Osborne, chairman of the Safe Staffing Alliance which includes union members and the Royal College of Nursing, said last month one-to-eight was an absolute minimum and a 'red card'. Another campaign called Four to One has been launched by Unison members after nurses told of 'horror stories' of wards with 12 or 14 patients per nurse. 'We need to reinforce the message that one nurse caring for more than eight patients is not only unsatisfactory, it is dangerous,' Ms Osborne wrote in the industry magazine Nursing Standard. 'It could mean the difference between life and death... A one to eight ratio buys just seven and a half minutes of a registered nurse’s time per patient per hour. 'What can you do in seven and a half minutes? Make a cup of tea, strip and make two beds, do cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowing three minutes without oxygen could leave a patient dead or brain dead?' The move comes after an inquest heard a . retired policeman had to tell nurses his mother had died after . finding her 'propped up' and 'cold' during a hospital visit. Death: An inquest heard Joan James (pictured) was found 'propped up' in her hospital bed by her son . Joan . James, 85, from Solihull, Birmingham, was found dead by Martyn James, . 54, on January 22 last year, 30 minutes after she had last been checked . by a nurse. Nurses at . Heartlands in Birmingham had no idea Mrs James had died until her son - . who had unknowingly been downstairs getting a coffee - raised the alarm, . the widow's inquest was told. A Department of Health spokesman told MailOnline today: 'At the moment it's for local NHS bodies to decide staffing levels but in light of the Francis report, the Department has been very involved. 'Staffing levels are something that we want to be looked at in more detail and that's why we commissioned NICE to produce this draft guidance. 'There are over 5,100 more nurses on our . wards since 2010... We . have increased the NHS budget in real terms and are clear that hospitals . must balance their books whilst ensuring compassionate, quality care . for all. 'We know this can and is being done.' A new website, which was originally due to be launched last month, is now due to go live next month with an unprecendented level of detail on how well individual hospital wards are staffed. A public consultation on the staffing plans, meanwhile, is running until June 10 and the guidelines are due to be finalised this summer.","Rules are suggested in draft guidelines in wake of damning Stafford inquiry .

"A man who was quarantined in a Gold Coast hospital this morning has been cleared by Queensland Health of not contracting the Ebola virus. The 27-year-old man, believed to be Michael Walsh, was taken to Gold Coast University Hospital at 7.40am suffering from Ebola-like symptoms. He is believed to have fallen ill while at a police watchhouse after he was arrested overnight for trespassing at Surfers Paradise. Dr Jeannette Young, Queensland's chief health officer, thanked all health and ambulance staff involved in handling the patient. 'It was a job well done and serves to show the community that our emergency preparedness plans are sound, and that they can rely on their health services,' she said in a statement. Scroll down for video . A 27-year-old man, believed to be Michael Walsh, was rushed to a Gold Coast hospital and quarantined amid fears he had the Ebola virus on Thursday morning . A Gold Coast University Hospital spokeswoman said an incoming patient was being 'isolated and assessed' after being identified by paramedics 'as having symptoms of Ebola virus' Dr Young said it was highly unlikely the Ebola virus would make its way to Queensland.She said anyone who had travelled to West Africa who was concerned about the outbreak and their health should contact their GP. Paramedics were called as a precautionary measure after reportedly telling officers he was unwell. Gold Coast Health is assessing a patient transferred to the Gold Coast University Hospital afterbeing identified by paramedics as having symptoms of Ebola Virus Disease. The patient is being assessed in accordance with universal infection control procedures. Our Director Infectious Diseases Dr John Gerrard had confirmed that Initial clinical assessmentsuggests it is exceedingly unlikely that the patient has Ebola Virus Disease but he is being isolatedin accordance with national guidelines. The Gold Coast University Hospital has been designed to accommodate patients with infectiousdisease. Prior to the results, Dr Young had  said the man would remain in hospital until the results of forensic testing were available. 'It's very unlikely that the results will come back positive,' she told reporters. 'He doesn't have a fever or early symptoms of Ebola.' Dr Young said even if the results were positive, there would not be an outbreak of the deadly disease in Australia. 'We won't have an outbreak here because we are very prepared. We've got systems in place at the border to identify symptoms... and we have good systems of hygiene,' she said. The hospital's Chief Executive Damian Green said earlier on Thursday the patient had been 'isolated and assessed' after being identified by paramedics 'as having symptoms of Ebola virus'. 'Gold Coast Health can confirm a patient has been transferred to Gold Coast University Hospital after being identified by paramedics as having symptoms of Ebola virus,' Mr Green said earlier on Thursday. '(The hospital) is taking necessary precautions and has isolated the patient who is currentlybeing assessed. 'Gold Coast Heath has processes in place to safely manage such circumstances. Universal infection control procedures are in place and there is limited risk to patients and staff.' The Director of Infectious Diseases, Dr John Gerrard, said the man was more likely to be suffering from malaria and his blood test results would be available on Thursday night . It is understood the man was charged with trespass after an incident on the property of the Chevron Renaissance hotel on Ferny Avenue, one of many huge tourist resorts in Surfers Paradise . Police told Daily Mail Australia the man was not complaining of any medical condition at the time of his arrest and subsequently taken to Southport Watchhouse. It is understood he was charged with trespass after an incident on the property of the Chevron Renaissance hotel on Ferny Avenue, one of many huge tourist resorts in Surfers Paradise. The manager of the hotel, Michelle Baldwin, told Daily Mail Australia the incident did not happen inside the building, but she refused to comment on whether it occurred out the front. She said the man was not a guest of the hotel and she had not spoken to authorities about the incident. Police said the man will face court on September 25. The man was isolated in accordance with national guidelines at the Gold Coast University Hospital on Thursday . Paramedics were instructed to wear protective clothing like health workers in Africa (pictured) before they transported the man to Gold Coast University Hospital .

'So while I'm happy to be recovered and alive, there's a lot of stuff on my mind with what's going on back there,' he said. ‘It would be relatively safe for me to go back and work there, and it's really the least I could do having received all this amazing care and have people look after me and potentially save my life. 'It's the least I could do to go back and return the favour to some other people, even just for a little while.' The current epidemic is the largest Ebola outbreak in history and has already claimed the lives of at least 2,296 people. The WHO said on Tuesday that it had recorded 4,293 cases of Ebola in five West African countries as of September 6. The outbreak has already affected multiple countries and sparked several travel warnings. It is a haemorrhagic fever spread through body fluids such as the blood, sweat or vomit of those who are infected with the disease. Mr Pooley, 29, was rushed back to London's Royal Free Hospital for life-saving care in this high level isolation apparatus . Ebola is a haemorrhagic fever spread through body fluids such as the blood, sweat or vomit of those who are infected with the disease . WHAT IS EBOLA?Ebola is a viral illness. Initial symptoms can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding. WHEN DID THE OUTBREAK BEGIN?In December 2013 in Guinea, but it was not detected until March 2014. HOW MANY HAVE DIED?A total of 2,296 have died out of 4293 recorded Ebola cases in five West African countries, according to the WHO's latest report on September 6. HOW DOES IT SPREAD?It spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. WHEN ARE PEOPLE CONTAGIOUS?Ebola isn't contagious until symptoms appear. The incubation period - the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms - is two to 21 days. IS THERE A VACCINE?There is no licensed vaccine for Ebola available. This month scientists said they may have developed an effective vaccine for the Ebola virus after an experimental immunisation gave monkeys long-term protection from the deadly disease. WHEN DID IT FIRST EMERGE?Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, in Nzara, Sudan, and in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was in a village situated near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name. HOW WAS IT INTRODUCED TO HUMANS?In Africa, infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys and forest antelope. The current epidemic is the largest Ebola outbreak in history and has already claimed the lives of at least 2,296 people . A pair of experimental Ebola vaccines that protect monkeys from the fatal disease ravaging West Africa have been developed. The vaccine is effective for at least five weeks in lab monkeys but requires boosting with an additional vaccine to extend its protection to 10 months, according to a new study. A pair of experimental Ebola vaccines that protect monkeys from the fatal disease ravaging West Africa have been developed . The findings offer a glimpse of which - if any - of the Ebola vaccines in development will prove effective, and in what form. Pharmaceutical firms are accelerating their efforts to provide Ebola vaccines and treatments as the worst known outbreak of the virus tears through West Africa, killing more than 2,000 people. The results of the new study suggest, for instance, that a vaccine by pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) now being tested on healthy volunteers will protect against Ebola infection in the short term, but may have to be augmented for long-term protection. The study, published in Nature Medicine, is the first to report that a vaccine regimen produced 'durable immunity' against Ebola, protecting four out of four monkeys for 10 months. 'He's had a little chicken soup': Wife of US missionary with Ebola says he is showing signs of improvement since arriving for treatment in Nebraska. The vaccine uses a chimp adenovirus, closely related to a human version that causes upper respiratory tract infections, into which scientists spliced an Ebola gene. The adenovirus infects cells in a vaccinated animal, causing them to take up the gene and produce Ebola proteins. That primes the immune system to attack the proteins of Ebola viruses when an infection occurs.","Queensland health revealed the blood tests had a negative result .

"It has wings lighter than a feather and is one of the most delicate creatures on earth. But this tiny moth can frighten off predators far bigger then itself - with its scary spider-like markings. The Lygodium Spider Moth knows how to stand up for itself by using intricate patterns that mimic the shape of a spider - deterring potential predators from attacking it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery: Researchers think that the creepy spider markings help protect it from predators . This spider moth species is a dramatic example of how one species can reap benefits from mimicking or looking like another species . The wings have patterns that make it resemble the eight legs of a spider. The fascinating bug was discovered in Thailand in 2005, and is described in the journal Annals Of The Entomological Society of America. The moth feeds on ferns, and the researchers think that the creepy spider markings help protect it from predators, Business Insider said.

The moth has other unique features to help it in its battle for survival. Its caterpillar-like form makes it resemble beetle larvae. When the moth reaches adult state it also has armored segments on its rear similar to those on beetles but unlike anything seen before in a moth, the Featured Creature blog wrote. Previous research on insects suggests that when prey - like the Lygodium Spider Moth - sense an approaching spider, they stretch out their wings and the predator thinks it has met one of its own species. It will often flee to avoid an aggressive confrontation, the Why Evolution Is True blog said. So a moth with this pattern might escape being eaten because it either frightens off oncoming predators or flies away while its predator is startled.","Has pattern that resembles eight legs of a spider .

The missionary priest arrived in Spain from Liberia in a stable condition but died five days later . The country has been placed on the World Health Organization's list of countries considered at 'high risk' of an Ebola outbreak. Kenya is considered to be at particular risk because it is a major transport, with a large number of flights from West Africa arriving in the country every day, a WHO official said. The warning is the most serious yet that the deadly disease could spread to East Africa. News that Kenya is now considered at 'high risk' of an Ebola outbreak came as a top African doctor suffering from the disease had been considered for an experimental drug treatment, but did not receive it before he died. Despite the huge number of Ebola deaths and infections in West Africa, only Mr Parajes and two Americans have so-far received an experimental anti-Ebola medication called ZMapp. Although the drug did not save Mr Parajes' life, it has been credited with the 'miraculous' recovery of two American aid workers.

"Dessie Quinn, 43, died yesterday in Mountcharles, Co Donegal in the Irish Republic after recently returning from Freetown, Sierra Leone . The body of an Irish man who returned from Sierra Leone earlier this month is being tested to see if he died from Ebola. Dessie Quinn, 43, from Mountcharles, Co Donegal was found dead yesterday morning after he went to bed last night complaining of 'flu-like' symptoms. Mr Quinn had recently been working in Freetown, Sierra Leone for a telecommunications company. It is understood that he returned home on holiday one week ago. Public health officials have tested blood samples from Mr Quinn and they hope to discover whether he contracted Ebola later today. The Irish government is awaiting the results of the tests before holding an emergency meeting. A spokesperson for the Irish Health Service Executive said: 'Tests being carried out on deceased person recently returned from Africa. 'The HSE is currently assessing a suspected case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Donegal. 'The public health department was made aware earlier today of the remains of an individual, discovered early this morning, who had recently travelled to the one of the areas in Africa affected by the current Ebola virus disease outbreak. 'The appropriate national guidelines, in line with international best practice, are being followed by the public health team dealing with the situation. This means that the body of the deceased has been isolated to minimise the potential spread of any possible virus. 'Blood samples have been sent for laboratory testing to confirm whether or not this individual had contracted Ebola virus disease. 'Until a diagnosis is confirmed, and as a precautionary measure, the individual's remains will stay in the mortuary pending the laboratory results. 'The risk of transmission of any disease is considered to be extremely low. As a precautionary measure, appropriate infection control procedures are being put in place in the community and at the mortuary pending the outcome of laboratory tests.' The US Center for Disease Control has released a map showing the prevalence of Ebola in Sierra Leone . Dr Darina O'Flanagan of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre said: 'In general, the risk of contracting Ebola virus disease is extremely low and would involve very close personal contact with the infected individual or their body fluids for there to be any risk at all. 'We await the outcome of the laboratory tests before we will know whether or not this individual had contracted Ebola virus disease. The appropriate public health guidelines are being followed at every stage in this process as a precaution.' According to Irish public health officials: 'After two days and up to 21 days following exposure to the virus the disease may start suddenly with fever, muscle aches, weakness, headache and sore throat. The next stage of the disease is characterised by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash and failure of the liver and kidneys. Some patients also have heavy internal and external bleeding and multi-organ failure.'

His body is currently being held Letterkenny where it is undergoing tests . Mr Quinn returned to his parents home in Mountcharles, Co Donegal where he died after complaining of fever . Public health officials confirmed that Mr Quinn was taken to Letterkenny General Hospital, pictured . One local man who knew the suspected victim said he was talking to him last week at a festival. 'I met him at the festival in Mountcharles last Friday,' he said. 'He was just home and as far as I know he was in Donegal since he came back from Sierra Leone. He could have been back two weeks or three weeks, I'm not sure.' The man added: 'Everyone knew him. He was great company to be along with, he was a very nice fella.' Health chiefs have stressed that the risk of transmission of any disease is considered to be 'extremely low' but precautionary measures have been put in place. Clampdown: Officers are pictured inspecting a boat in China that had dropped off items in Sierra Leone for fear of spreading the deadly disease that has marred the west African country . Donegal Mayor John Campbell said the county was shocked but urged people not to panic. 'It is unconfirmed that it is Ebola at this stage and even if it was confirmed the chances of it being passed on to anyone else are very small so people shouldn't panic,' he said. 'It's a big shock in the area. I know the family well and our thoughts are with them.' Donegal TD Thomas Pringle urged people in the county not to worry until health chiefs carry out their tests. 'This is a sudden tragic death and because this man worked in Africa the HSE have to take precautions,' he said. 'I think we should wait until the cause of death is confirmed. Given the media attention about Ebola over the last while it is important that people do not panic or worry about it until we hear from the HSE.'","Dessie Quinn, 43, from Mountcharles, Co Donegal died yesterday morning .

Travel officials throughout the world have stepped up monitoring the spread of the disease, such as this South Korean quarantine officer checking the body temperature of a traveler . Health professionals in Canada have closely monitored the outbreak of the disease and are watching for passengers returning from West Africa. Some 1,000 people have been killed since the virus emerged in Guinea in March, quickly spreading to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola. This is the largest and longest outbreak ever recorded of Ebola, which has a death rate of about 50 percent and has so far killed at least 932 people. The World Health Organization declared similar emergencies for the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and for polio in May. The WHO chief, Dr. Margaret Chan, said the announcement is 'a clear call for international solidarity' although she acknowledged that many countries would probably not have any Ebola cases. Nurses in Liberia, where Ebola has been spreading, remove the bodies of victims of disease from a home outside of Monrovia . 'Countries affected to date simply do not have the capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and complexity on their own,' Chan told reporters in Geneva. 'I urge the international community to provide this support on the most urgent basis possible.' In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have already elevated their Ebola response to the highest level and have recommended against traveling to West Africa. On Thursday, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden told a Congressional hearing that the current outbreak is set to sicken more people than all previous outbreaks of the disease combined. Director Margaret Chan speaks to reporters after the World Health Organization declared a state of emergency following the spread of Ebola throughout West Africa .","Patient is being held in isolation at Brampton Civic Hospital in Ontario after returning from Nigeria .

"Sobbing, Lydia, 16, and her younger siblings Blessing, 11, Pauline, nine, and Paul, five, can only watch as the body of their mother is taken away. Dressed in hazard suits that cover them from head to toe, the men loading the plastic-wrapped corpse onto a truck are a grim sight. But they, like the plastic wrap that shrouds the body, are necessary for Juana, 45, like thousands of others in her native Liberia, died from the deadly Ebola virus. Tragic: With their grandmother Sonnie, Paul, five, and Pauline, nine, watch as their mother's body is taken away . With 2,909 deaths and 6,185 cases of the disease reported in Liberia, Nigeria, Guinea and Sierra Leone so far, Ebola orphans are, sadly, not unusual. But with neighbours and extended families reluctant to take the children in for fear of succumbing to the disease themselves, Plan International says the future is bleak for the youngsters affected. 'The large number of . single-parent families in Liberia means that as mothers are dying from . Ebola, children lose their sole care-giver, and have no-one to look . after them,' explains Koala . Oumarou, Country Director for Plan Liberia. 'Once . their mother dies, the orphaned children have to leave school, if they . were in school in the first place. 'They are ostracised by the community, . and they have to work, to try to make a living and support themselves.' Upsetting: Neighbours watch as men wearing head-to-toe hazard suits prepare to collect Juana's body . Grim: Health workers in hazard suits carry Juana's plastic-wrapped corpse away after her death from Ebola . Alone: With help from her grandmother, 68, Lydia, 16, will now care for her younger siblings . Ebola has . so far claimed 1,137 lives in Liberia, according to the World Health Organisation, among them . scores of single mothers who have left young families behind. Since . the civil war that ended in 2003, the country has been plagued by . social problems, with broken, one-parent families becoming the norm, as . traumatised, . unemployed men reject marriage and family values. Now, . according to government sources, up to 300 children are struggling to . cope after losing their mothers to the epidemic. In . Bomi County near Monrovia, an area particularly badly affected by years of civil war, an estimated 75 per cent of women . with children are single mothers, while nationally, single parents account for fully half of the country's families. It's a situation that is all too familiar for Lydia, herself a single mother of one, and her siblings, who live in the isolated village of Voijama in northern Liberia. With four different fathers, none of whom are on the scene, and only their elderly grandmother to look after them, none have much hope for the future or faith in their extended family. All over: As her sobbing children watch, Juana's body is loaded into a pick-up truck and driven away . Harrowing: Such is the fear in capital Monrovia, bodies of Ebola victims are sometimes left where they drop . Terrified: With 1,137 already dead from the disease in Liberia, people are becoming increasingly frightened . 'We’ve not seen anyone as a father since we were born,' says the heart-breakingly grown-up Pauline, nine. Lydia . agrees. 'We have not seen any family member before our mother died, . besides our grandmother,' she reveals. Their grandmother, Sonnie, 68, is doing her best to care for the children but, well into old age, is unable to work and struggles to keep up with her boisterous grandson. 'I will find it difficult at my age to fully cater to these children, now that I am not working again,' she admits. 'I . was one of many traditional midwives who the government forcibly retired, on the grounds that we were illiterate. I am also too old to do . farm work or cleaning work.' Neigbours, terrified of succumbing to Ebola themselves, have refused to help, which means that the bulk of the childcare now falls to Lydia, who has had to leave school to take care of her siblings. Ostracised: Juana's four children now face an uncertain future and have been ostracised by their neighbours . Help: The shocked and grieving children say they would like their extended family to come to their aid . And with money tight, her younger siblings have also had to give up their education - much to aspiring teacher Pauline's distress. 'I’d . love to be a teacher in the future like my mother once was,' she admits, 'but with all this going on, becoming a teacher will not happen.' Worst of all though, is the social stigma that they now face following their mother's death. 'These . children are really stigmatised by Ebola,' adds Oumarou. 'Many families just do not . want to help them after their parents die because they are scared of . contracting the disease. But these children are in dire need of . assistance.' 'Extended . families don’t want to take care of orphans of affected parents or . other vulnerable children anymore out of fear of being contaminated or . stigmatised in the community,' adds child protection specialist, Anita Queirazza. 'Some . foster families have abandoned orphans after receiving the accompanying . food and non-food assistance, leaving the children to fend for . themselves.' As for Lydia and her siblings, still struggling to come to terms with their mother's death, the future remains uncertain. 'I have my own responsibilities, and now . that of my little brother and sisters,' she says, adding: 'We’d be happy to have any relative . or family member come to assist us.'","An estimated 300 children have been orphaned by Ebola in Liberia alone .

"The rise of social networking sites is putting children at greater risk of bullying and body image worries than ever before, a leading headmaster has warned. Constant scrutiny on websites such as AskFM, Little Gossip, Facebook and Instagram leaves many teenagers  feeling like ‘the hopelessly inadequate stars of their own second-rate biopics’, Andrew Halls said. He said no previous generation had endured so much attention from peers who ‘adore, revile or all too publicly ignore on a moment-by-moment basis’. Headmaster Andrew Halls says the rise of social networking sites is putting children at greater risk of bullying and body image . Mr Halls, the head of King’s College . School, Wimbledon, an £18,900-a-year boys’ day school, urged schools to . instil ‘grit’ and emotional resilience in pupils to help them cope with . the pressures of modern life. Tomorrow, . 200 independent school heads and teachers will attend a ‘True Grit’ conference at his school on how to introduce resilience training for . pupils. Mr Halls said . anonymous chat sites such as AskFM and Little Gossip left children . ‘vulnerable to cruel and absurd slanders that, for some, can be . literally life-ending’. Teenagers . now live the ‘tortured drama of their adolescence under the scrutiny of . hundreds or even thousands of others’, he added, which often leaves . them feeling ‘small and vulnerable’. ‘Social . networking sites require every 21st-century teenager to live his or her . life under the eye of an electronic adjudicator far more cruel and . censorious than any examiner, school teacher, or parent,’ he said. The rise of social networking sites has meant that young people are now living their lives 'under the eye of an electronic adjudicator', Andrew Halls warned . ‘No . previous generation has spent so long online, “liking” and being . “liked”, or devastatingly ignored,  in the OCD world of never-ending . updates, status change, Instagram, AskFM, Little Gossip and Facebook. No . wonder that every teenager can feel like the hopelessly inadequate star . of his own second-rate biopic.’ Girls and boys of all backgrounds are affected due to the ‘democracy of the internet’, argued Mr Halls. And . he said some independent schools had been ‘woefully reluctant’ to . discuss mental health issues, estimated to affect one in ten young . people. He added: ‘Girls . from aspirational families are the fastest-growing group using mental . health services, as they strive to achieve more and more impossibly . brilliant results. ‘We know that boys and young men are much more affected by body image pressures than was the case twenty years ago. Mr Halls, headteacher at King's College Wimbledon (pictured) said independent schools have been 'woefully reluctant' to discuss mental health problems amongst schoolchildren . ‘And . now we know this can afflict the public school 1st XV hero addicted to . fitness routines and diet supplements just as much  as the forgotten boy . in the corner of a comprehensive school locker-room cutting runes of . self-loathing into his arm.’ Mr Halls added that young  people are increasingly ‘tormented’ by a ‘cult of self-consciousness’. ‘They . know that the world is competitive, and they are surrounded by images . not just of the impossibly beautiful, but of the incredibly wealthy, or . the incredibly bright. How can they compete?’ he said. ‘Then . they see in their school a thousand posters admonishing human beings . for their part in  global warming, famine, pollution, over-population . and war. ‘We mean well when . we lecture our pupils in this way, but to what degree do we present . them with a challenge that seems so impossible the only response is to . crouch with arms crossed before their eyes?’ Mr Halls said that the problems faced by 21st-century teenagers ‘cut through class and gender stereotypes’. ‘Almost . every bright sixth-former from an affluent family will know of someone . who is suffering from a body image-related problem. 'But we also know . that the UK invariably tops Europe’s league table for teenage suicides, . and these are frequently of less well-educated or less affluent . children.’ 'A recent . Government study found that almost a quarter of children live with . parents who are in an unhappy relationship, with a higher proportion . among poor families, he said. 'These children are more at risk of mental . health problems or drug and alcohol abuse. ‘These . issues affect everyone, children and parents, in 21st-century Britain – . not just dysfunctional homes, and not just affluent ones,’ Mr Halls . said. He added that ‘true . grit and resilience training’ was intended to show children they could . ‘change things both within them and around them for the better’. He said the conference aimed to help teenagers ‘rise above despair, focus on their own strengths and win the battle of life’.","Andrew Halls says youngsters loive life under 'electronic adjudicator'

"A 'mystery haemorrhagic fever' was flagged up by software nine days before the World Health Organisation formally announced the Ebola epidemic. The fever was seen developing in the forested areas of southeastern Guinea by a free online tool known as HealthMap on March 19. The US group behind the software started putting out alerts and providing information to the World Health Organisation, which reported its first confirmed case of Ebola on March 23. Zoom in on the interactive map to see areas affected by the Ebola outbreak. Move the markers on the bottom bar to change the date . Professor Peter Piot, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who also discovered the Ebola virus, said the disease. is 'in theory easy to contain'. 'Well it’s spectacular because once you get it, at least with this strain of Ebola, you’ve got like a 90 per cent chance of dying,' he told CNN. 'That’s spectacular by any standard – one of the most lethal viruses that exist. On the other hand, you need really close contact to become infected. 'So just being on the bus with someone with Ebola, that’s not a problem. It’s also not iatrogenic [ph] so it’s not transmitted through, you know, droplets and so on. So it is really something that in theory is easy to contain.' Since then, the HealthMap team has created an interactive Ebola map, free to use by anyone who wants to see where the disease is spreading. The interactive map, run by scientists in Boston, uses algorithms to scour tens of thousands of social media sites, local news and government websites to detect and track disease outbreaks. It then filters out irrelevant data to identify dangerous diseases and map their locations with the help of health experts. 'It shows some of these informal sources are helping paint a picture of what's happening that's useful to these public health agencies,' said HealthMap co-founder John Brownstein. HealthMap is operated by a group of 45 researchers, epidemiologists and software developers at Boston Children's Hospital. The tool was introduced in 2006 for public health specialists, but that changed as the system evolved and the public became increasingly hungry for information during the swine flu pandemic. HealthMap generates information that includes locations of specific outbreaks and tracks new cases and deaths. The system is also capable of logging public sentiment. Users can zoom in on specific countries and regions on the map, with markers showing where the main cases have been reported. Clicking on a marker directs the users to news reports of the outbreak.

The fever was seen developing in the forested areas of southeastern Guinea by a free online tool known as HealthMap on March 19, as shown on this screenshot of the HealthMap . The group behind the software started putting out alerts and providing information to the World Health Organisation, which reported its first confirmed case of Ebola on March 23. By then, the map had tracked 29 cases in Guinea and 29 deaths - all reported by sources such as social media and local government sites . Ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent. In the current outbreak that is just over 50 per cent. It is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats, which are eaten as a delicacy. The virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people. Symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. People are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days. Although the disease has no cure, modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down. Source: World Health Organisation . The Ebola outbreak, the largest and longest ever recorded for the disease, has so far killed more than 950 people. The map shows how it emerged in Guinea in March and has since spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Hospitals in Europe are now preparing for the possible spread of Ebola out of Africa as the World Health Organisation said a vaccine could be 'rushed through' by early next year. Doctors at the specialised quarantine unit at Berlin's Charite hospital today showed off their readiness, amid news that two Germans could be carrying the deadly virus. Dr Brad Crotty, a clinical informatics expert at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre who is not part of HealthMap, told the Boston Herald there is still work to be done to tune out 'background noise'. 'You can get early signs, but they're not always right,' Dr Crotty said. Sumiko Mekaru, who oversees HealthMap operations, said it's meant to be used alongside conventional health reports rather than replace them.

"Boris Johnson has boasted of being the first Mayor of London of ‘Muslim extraction’ as he sought to attract billions of pounds of Arab money for the capital. He told the story of his great-great-grandfather Ahmed Hamdi, a Muslim entrepreneur who made his money in beeswax. Mr Johnson defended Britain’s immigration policy, boasting that the spirit of openness could be seen in ‘shisha bars’ across the capital. History: Boris Johnson told the World Islamic Economic Forum in London about his own ancestry in the Arab world . Addressing the Ninth World Islamic Economic Forum, Mr Johnson urged wealthy figures from across the Arab world to invest in London. He told them: ‘Let’s build up trade, co-operation and partnership and let us do it in a city that has risen since the days of Offa to become the greatest on Earth. ‘With more American banks than NY, more museums than Paris, less rainfall than Rome and the greatest centre for Islamic finance in the world.’ Mr Johnson drew on his own background to make the case for the capital. ‘I am very proud to be here this morning because I am sure that I am the first Mayor of London of partly Muslim extraction, and indeed the descendant of a Muslim entrepreneur by the name of Ahmed Hamdi. ‘My father’s father’s father’s father - a pious man of Anatolia who made the Haj and who more or less cornered the beeswax market in Istanbul, which was a very good idea because you needed beeswax candles to light the mosques. ‘So he was in the same commercially agreeable position as the big six energy companies in Britain today, though his prices were obviously more reasonable. ‘He flourished mightily minding his own beeswax, as we say in England.’ Vision: The London Mayor said he wanted to see more Muslim investment in the capital . Immigration: Mr Johnson rejected the idea that Britain should be 'less open and less welcoming' However, he said Mr Hamdi was ‘overwhelmed by a technological disaster’ when American Thomas Edison invented the electric light bulb. His son abandoned beeswax and become a controversial politician and journalist and was eventually assassinated, Mr Johnson said. His great-grandfather ‘grew up knowing the Koran off by heart and he would have been stunned to find that his descendant had gone on to become Mayor of this city, and even more amazed to find that the world had so progressed that today we are welcoming the world’s first Islamic Economic Forum to take place outside the Muslim world’. Mr Johnson announced a £100million fund to encourage tech start-ups from the Muslim world to move to Britain. It comes after David Cameron unveiled a £200million new Islamic bond - known as a ‘sukuk’ - which complies with Islamic rules on investments and said the London Stock Exchange will launch a new Islamic index alongside the FTSE. Mr Johnson said London was being transformed by new transport investments and developments that 'turn out not just to be financed by Muslim investors but whose funding methods often turn out to be sharia compliant'. Change: Mr Johnson said London is being transformed developments financed by Muslim investors which are also sharia compliant . They include the Emirates Air Line cable car across the Thames, development of Battersea and the Shard 'the only building in the world that looks as though it is actually emerging through the skin of the earth like the tip of a gigantic cocktail stick emerging through the skin of an intergalactic pickled onion'. Mr Johnson went on: 'You may ask yourself why are investors picking London: I will tell you – we have the right time zone, language, we have the rule of law, we have a glorious free press. 'But above all we are open to talent and to trade with people from different cultures and backgrounds . 'You can see it in the shisha bars and the fantastic Shubbak festivals and to all those who say we should be less open and less welcoming, I would point out that this has long been the secret of London’s success.'","Mayor urges Ninth World Islamic Economic Forum to back London .

"Freed Amanda Knox is in regular contact with her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, he has revealed in an interview. The couple were sensationally cleared of murdering and sexually assaulting student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox, 24. She and Sollecito, 27, had been seeing each other for a week before the brutal murder and initially they had been sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively but they were released on appeal earlier this month. Contact: Amanda Knox, pictured in Seattle last week, is in regular . contact with her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, left, he has . revealed in an interview. He is planning to visit her in Seattle before Christmas . Breaking his silence for the first time in an interview with glossy Italian weekly Oggi, computer studies graduate Sollecito said: 'We need each other - we speak to each other on the phone and write to each other every day.' Then, speaking of his invitation to visit Knox in her hometown of Seattle, Sollecito added: 'I will certainly go and see Amanda. She asked me over and I accepted with pleasure and there is no saying I will wait until Christmas. 'I could go earlier - I could go at any moment. I really want to see her again, to speak with her and look into her eyes. Knox and Sollecito were photographed kissing shortly after the death of Meredith Kercher . 'We need to speak and write to each other to try and understand what happened to us and to look forward to a future that appeared broken forever but instead we can still build on. 'We have so many things to say to each other. We spent four years in a circle of hell, we suffered unspeakably and it ruined our lives.' Knox has kept a low profile since she . was freed and is said to be negotiating a money-spinning TV interview . deal with an American TV network which could make her $1 million - with . the potential of earning up to ten times that amount as well. Since returning to Seattle she has been seen out and about with friends but generally keeping a low profile and spending time with her family. The couple pictured in 2007. Sollecito said: 'We have so many things to say to each other. We spent four years in a circle of hell, we suffered unspeakably and it ruined our lives.' She was pictured out in downtown Seattle earlier this month with best friend Madison Paxton, who stayed close to her while she was in prison, and days earlier taking a drive with her step-father Chris Mellas. She wrote in prison of how she longed to . see her former boyfriend, David Johnsrud, and he was one of the first . to pay her a visit on her return, although her father Curt stressed their . relationship was now one simply of ‘friendship’. Asked how his daughter had changed since . she was jailed, Mr Knox said in an interview earlier this month that she was little different, other than . occasionally slipping into speaking Italian and being less trusting of . authority after her experience with Italian police. ‘It’s almost like . she hasn’t lost a step with the family, which is nice to see,’ he said. Freed: Knox addresses supporters and the media at Seattle airport supported by her mother Edda Mellas following her sensational release from prison . He said his daughter had to remain . largely indoors for the moment, describing it as ‘a different version of . jail’ but said she had at least been able to lie down in the grass – . something she had longed for while in prison. Mr Knox also revealed his daughter was being shadowed by a bodyguard and the family has been inundated with hate mail and threatening phone calls. Knox and Sollecito, from Bisceglie near Bari, were originally found guilty in 2009 of the murder which had taken two years previously in the Italian hilltop town of Perugia. However the appeal heard how the original evidence used to convict them was flawed and contaminated and they were freed after an independent forensic report ordered by the judge condemned the forensic investigation. Jailed: Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 24, (left) was convicted of . the murder and sexual assault of Meredith Kercher (right) after a fast-track . trial in 2008 . Key to the case was a 30cm kitchen knife found in Sollecito's apartment and on which was said to be DNA from Knox on the handle and that of Meredith on the blade. But the report said the amount on the knife was so low is should not be used to convict Knox - although they confirmed it was her DNA on the handle but she argued she had used it to cook with. DNA from Sollecito which was found on Meredith's bloodied bra clasp was also dismissed as it emerged it had been left in the murder scene for six weeks before being collected and leaving it open to contamination. Prosecutors in Perugia have said they will appeal the decision but they will have to wait until the judge's written ruling on the verdict is published sometime in the New Year. Meredith from Coulsdon, Surrey, was a Leeds University student and was in Perugia for her degree course and she had only been in Italy for two months before she was murdered in November 2007. Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 24, was convicted of murder and sexual assault after a fast track trial in 2008 and originally sentenced to 30 years but this was later reduced to 16 on appeal.","Raffaele Sollecito said the pair speak to each other on the phone every day to 'try and understand what happened'

"Generous: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is pledging $50million to address the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Above,  the Microsoft co-founder pictured at the U.S. Open Men's Final Monday night in New York . The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced Wednesday that it will spend $50million to support emergency response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, marking the group's largest donation to a humanitarian effort. 'It became clear to us over the last seven to 10 days that the pace and scope of the epidemic was increasing significantly,' Chris Elias, president of global development for the world's largest charitable foundation, told The Associated Press. The Seattle-based foundation said the money will go to the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and international organizations involved in fighting transmission of the virus. The money will be used to purchase supplies and to develop vaccines, therapies and better diagnostic tools. 'By fighting Ebola now, we can make sure it doesn't become an endemic in [West] Africa,' Gates tweeted on Wednesday. The foundation wants to help stop the outbreak as well as accelerate development of treatments and improve prevention. Elias said foundation officials have been talking to its partners around the world to assess the best use of its dollars and could not say yet how much would be spent on the emergency response and how much on research and development. 'One of our key advantages is flexibility,' he said. Global health and development dominate the work of the foundation, which has given away $30billion since 1997. The foundation formed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife reported an endowment worth $40billion as of March 2014. The foundation was particularly influenced by the request on Friday by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for $600million to fight the Ebola outbreak. Scroll down for video . Fears: The Ebola virus has killed more than 2,00 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria this year in the largest outbreak of the disease ever. Above, a health worker sprays a man believed to be dying from the virus with disinfectant chemicals  in Monrovia, Liberia on September 4 . Ban said efforts in the next few weeks would be essential to stopping the virus that has killed more than 2,000 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The $50million includes $10million the foundation previously committed for emergency operations, treatment and research. Of that money, $5million went to the World Health Organization for emergency operations and research and development. Another $5million went to the U.S. Fund for UNICEF to support efforts in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea to purchase medical supplies, coordinate response efforts and spread information. Some of the $50million will support strengthening existing health care systems in the countries affected by the outbreak, the foundation said.

Left: Lucy with sister Emma at on the big day; Right: Lucy with the bride and fellow bridesmaids in the maternity ward . Her cramps became more intense throughout the day but she winced her way down the aisle and even posed for photographs after the nuptials.

As the wedding approached she tried every trick in the book to make her baby come quicker - but the hot curries and acupuncture didn’t work. Her due date came and went and on the morning of her sister’s wedding, Lucy was woken up at 2am by painful contractions.

"A man who turned permanently blue after self-medicating for a skin condition has died. Paul Karason was 62 when he died Monday at Washington hospital, NBC Today reports. He was admitted to the hospital after suffering a heart attack. He later contracted pneumonia and had a severe stroke. Karason shot to Internet fame several years ago for the blue color of his skin, which was a side effect using a silver compound for more than a decade to treat a bad case of dermatitis on his face. Scroll down for video . Paul Karason, pictured in 2008, talks exclusively with NBC News' 'Today' about turning permanently blue after using colloidal silver . He led a very seclusive life until going onto NBC's Today Show in 2008 to discuss his condition, known as argyria, which is caused by the use of dietary supplements. To try and counteract the coloring in his skin, Karason had also begun self-administering doses of colloidal silver, which is a suspension of silver in a liquid base. His skin coloring earned him the nickname 'Papa Smurf,' which his estranged widow said he welcomed when it came from kids. Paul Karason was 62 when he died Monday at Washington hospital . 'That was a nickname he didn’t . appreciate, depending on who said it,' she told Today. 'If it was a kid . who ran up to him saying ""Papa Smurf,"" it would put a smile on his face. But if it was an adult, well ….'Silver has antibacterial properties and has been used to fight infection for thousands of years. But it went out of use when penicillin, which is far more effective, was developed. It continued to be used in some over-the-counter medicines until 1999, when the FDA banned it because it causes argyria, which is a result of the silver reacting with light the same way it does in photography. The silver collects in the skin and other organs and does not dissipate.","Paul Karason was 62 when he died Monday at Washington hospital .

"Pest: Cannibal slugs have invaded Britain's gardens and eats carrion, excrement and its own kind . It sounds like the plot of a 1950s B-movie – giant slugs have invaded and gone on the rampage in English gardens and allotments. The six-inch-long monsters have a voracious appetite and gardeners and growers fear their crops and prize plants will be annihilated. The Spanish slugs, which have also been nicknamed killer slugs, also feed on dead mice, meat and even each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets. Sightings have been reported as far afield as East Anglia, the West Midlands, the New Forest, the South East coast and London. Victims of this modern Spanish armada include Graham Cornell, who found dozens of them feasting on his garden in Lode, Cambridgeshire. ‘I’ve never seen anything like them,’ he said ‘They’re huge and they leave a trail behind them half an inch wide,’ he said. ‘They don’t seem to be affected by pellets – the only way to stop them is to spear them. Luckily, I’ve finished growing many of the things in my garden so they haven’t done as much damage as they might have done.’ The gastropods – classed as among the 100 most invasive species in Europe – were first spotted here in 2010 but cold weather helped kill them off. A large number were found in East Anglia last year and are believed to have hitched a lift on salad leaves imported from the Continent. This time the mild weather and, in particular, the lack of morning frosts has allowed them to thrive. There are fears they could breed with native species, creating a hybrid that can tolerate cold. Experts have warned of a ‘disaster waiting to happen’ if they become established in Britain because of their appetites and resistance to existing controls. Crops on farms could be devastated. Interloper: Gardener Graham Cornell with the giant Scandinavian slugs that are invading the garden at his home . The cannibal slugs have slipped into the UK on salad leaves from the continent - causing havoc in British gardens . Despite their name, Spanish slugs could have originated in western France. They eat dead or weaker members of their own species and other slugs. Like all slugs, they are hermaphrodites – meaning just one can produce an infestation. The Spanish slugs adapted to hot climates, where eggs are at risk of drying out, by laying hundreds. However, in our wet weather, most survive. Predators such as hedgehogs, and ducks control slugs – but this species is less likely to be tackled by these animals. A Cannibal slug is brownish in colour, is between eight and 12cm long and can be found in most of Europe. A typical black slug, in comparison, is normally between 10 and 12cm long and is mostly found in northern Europe. It is omnivorous, feeding mostly on dead animals, fungi and vegetation. They also threaten indigenous species – which are natural composters – by bringing new diseases and parasites. Other countries affected by the slug – Latin name Arion vulgaris – include Sweden and Norway where their slime became a skid hazard on roads. Steven Falk, an entomologist with the charity Buglife, confirmed the explosion in numbers. ‘It was a very slug-friendly winter,’ he said. ‘Frost is the enemy of the adult and we haven’t had one.’ Gardening writer Colin Hambidge added native slugs had also benefited from the mild weather. ‘There are loads and many of them are pretty big too. It’s the worst we’ve ever experienced. We really need a much harder winter this year.’","The invasive 'Arion vulgaris' has thrived in wet and mild conditions .

"It has been dubbed a 'death ray on wheels'. Boeing's 10 kilowatt laser can down a drone using an array of hi-tech sensors. And makers Boeing have even proved it can battle the weather - by tracking and firing through fog, wind and rain in its latest test. Scroll down for video ... Boeing's 10 kilowatt laser can down a drone using an array of hi-tech sensors - and is about to get a massive power boost . The laser makes an incredibly powerful, highly focused beam of light and aims it at a moving target. The lithium ion batteries that power the HEL MD’s laser are charged by a 60 kW diesel generator, so if the Army can keep the fuel tank full, they can shoot down incoming threats indefinitely. The system uses a telescope and infrared-based, wide field of view camera to locate and designate targets. Boeing has designed the system to be operated by a driver and an operator with a laptop and an Xbox controller. The truck-mounted weapon, known as the High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD), gives a hint at what a weapon of the future could look like. Using an invisible laser beam to exact targets, the rounds are capable of taking down drones from the sky and even missiles. The device was equipped with a 10-kilowatt solid state laser and a radar system mounted atop a heavy truck at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. 'Under windy, rainy and foggy weather conditions in Florida, these engagements were the most challenging to date with a 10-kilowatt laser on HEL MD,' said Dave DeYoung, Boeing Directed Energy Systems director. 'As proven at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in 2013 and at Eglin Air Force Base this spring, HEL MD is reliable and capable of consistently acquiring, tracking and engaging a variety of targets in different environments, demonstrating the potential military utility of directed energy systems.' In these recent demonstrations, HEL MD used a 10-kilowatt, high energy laser installed on an Oshkosh tactical military vehicle. The demonstrator is the first mobile, high-energy laser, counter rocket, artillery and mortar (C-RAM) platform to be built and demonstrated by the U.S. Army. 'With capabilities like HEL MD, Boeing is demonstrating that directed energy technologies can augment existing kinetic strike weapons and offer a significant reduction in cost per engagement,' said DeYoung. 'With only the cost of diesel fuel, the laser system can fire repeatedly without expending valuable munitions or additional manpower.' The latest test, carried out in Florida, saw the weapon used in fog, rain and wind - and it performed perfectly. Throughout the two series of demonstrations, Boeing achieved all performance objectives on schedule, successfully engaging more than 150 aerial targets including 60 mm mortars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The next step will be to install a 50 or 60-kilowatt laser on HEL MD to demonstrate counter RAM and UAV capability at this tactically significant power level. During . previous tests a 'quarter-sized' invisible laser beam successfully targeted . and destroyed more than 90 incoming mortar rounds and six to seven . unmanned drones. Mortars are  common battlefield weapons that are hard to protect against because they can be fired from short distances. Light speed: This artist's impression shows how the team behind the new weapon imagine it will work in practice . The mortars used in the test were standard 60 millimeter rounds – the length of a football — fired from a distance of less than two kilometers in salvos of two to three mortar rounds each. The laser’s success rate against incoming mortar shells indicates that battlefield protection from the small explosive rounds could be possible in a few years. Army video of the laser tests shows the laser targeting the mortar so that it burns up in mid-air and does not explode when it completes its trajectory. 'We turn it into a rock, basically,' said Bauer. Large test drones flying five kilometers from the laser system came to crash into the New Mexico desert by aiming the laser at the tail of the unmanned aircraft. An infrared camera on the video captured how a small dot of light on the tail slowly grew in intensity, forcing the craft to lose navigational control. The laser can also be used for less offensive purposes by dialing back its intensity to blind sensors aboard the drones. Plans call for shrinking the size of the laser system while also boosting its strength to 50 kilowatts, and ultimately 100 kilowatts. Shrinking its size will make it easier to mount on more mobile vehicles that can be used on the battlefield. Increasing the wattage will allow the beam to hit faster-moving targets at greater distances and in a shorter amount of time. For example,  a 100 kilowatt laser beam will be able to bring down a target in a tenth of the time it currently takes for a 10 kilowatt laser. The laser is able to fire and target only one incoming target at a time, so the idea is that when the lasers are fully operational they will be grouped in teams of three or five to protect against multiple incoming rounds. These laser units could be deployed in the future to help protect frontline units or bases . Ultimately the laser could be used against faster moving aircraft and cruise missiles.","The 'death ray' used a 10-kilowatt laser to down more than 150 targets .

"Oculus Rift promises to bring virtual reality experiences to everyone but, with the general release not expected till next year, it's not yet widely available. But if you don't want to wait, or don't have the money to shell out for a developer kit, one company has an alternative solution. Their bizarre headset lets you strap an iPad Mini, or an upcoming iPhone 6 Plus, to your face and apparently gives wearers the same virtual reality experience as those enjoyed on Oculus Rift. Scroll down for video . Toronto-based Metatecture is seeking funding for its AirVR device. The £30 ($49) virtual reality headset works by strapping an iPad to your face (shown) AirVR, which will retail for £30 ($49), is a project from company Metatecture in Toronto, Canada. They are currently seeking $20,000 in funding on Kickstarter to bring the product to market. If funding is achieved they hope to begin rolling out the device later this year. Oculus VR was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey. It is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games, but for other activities as well. Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg. A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015. The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year. To use the headset an iPad Mini is slotted into the holder at the front, with its display then split into two identical screens just like on an Oculus Rift, providing a 3D virtual reality experience. The user then straps the entire device to their head with straps, while foam pads ensure a comfortable fit. Inside there are two lenses inside the headset which provide stereoscopic vision while looking at the iPad Mini. Attaching headphones through the iPad Mini’s standard headphone port will also allow for sound to be played to the user. While wearing the headset the user still has access to the buttons on the iPad Mini. And the device also works with compatible gamepads so the user can enjoy gaming through the headset. There is also a ‘TouchStrip’ of buttons on the headset to control AirVR in and out of the virtual reality experience. In addition, unlike other VR systems like the Oculus Rift this device does not require a power source in the headset; instead, it relies solely on the built-in battery of the iPad Mini. For true 3D experiences apps and movies need to be developed specifically for such a virtual reality device. To show off the technology Metatecture has developed photo, movie and panorama apps for use with their headset. By splitting the screen and providing two lenses the viewer then can be given a VR experience like Oculus Rift. The device will retail for about $49 and should be on sale later this year . The company is also developing a version for iPhone 6 Plus called AirVR+ (pictured). Previously they had tried to use the VR technology with the iPhone 5 but found the screen to be too small . ‘The advanced 64-bit Processors and Graphics Systems allow AirVR to immerse users in vivid 3D worlds and experiences without the need for an external computer,’ the company explains on their Kickstarter page. The company are also planning to bring the device to Apple's iPhone 6 Plus when it is released soon with AirVR+. Previously they had tried to use the VR technology with the iPhone 5 but found the screen to be too small. The larger screen size of the iPhone 6 Plus will allow them to replicate a similar virtual reality experience to that on the iPad Mini. ‘The advanced 64-bit Processors and Graphics Systems allow AirVR to immerse users in vivid 3D worlds and experiences without the need for an external computer,’ the company explains on their Kickstarter page .

"Tottenham need their plans for a new stadium to be approved if they wish to keep up with the Premier League's top sides, according to Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. Spurs revealed it was 'highly unlikely' their plans for a proposed 56,000-seater ground adjacent to White Hart Lance will be completed ahead of the 2017-18 season, following a legal challenge by one of the landowners. Asked if Mauricio Pochettino's side needed their new stadium to keep up with the league's elite teams, Wenger replied: 'Financially, for sure. You cannot be in a business where you turn down 15,000 or 20,000 people every week. If your competitors have more financial power than you, at some stage you have to make a decision. Construction workers clear space for the new Tottenham stadium despite a legal challenge delaying progress . Arsene Wenger believes Tottenham need the money a new stadium would bring in order to keep up . 'It looks like everybody makes this decision now, because when you look at Liverpool, Everton, [they] want to increase their capacity. West Ham go to a bigger stadium next season so if you stay in a smaller capacity, it's even more difficult.' Arsenal went through a similar ordeal 15 years ago, as work on the 60,272-seater Emirates was delayed until 2004, before the Gunners made the switch from Highbury two years later. 'I just think it's much more difficult today,' said Wenger, 'because we built our stadium at a price that you couldn't afford it anymore. We managed to build our stadium by subsidising it with our own resources. That is much more difficult today.' Arsenal's improved financial position as a result of their Emirates move has allowed them to spend big on players like Germany international Mesut Ozil, who signed from Real Madrid in 2013 for a fee of £42.5million . Alexis Sanchez was the Gunners' marquee signing this summer, as he joined from La Liga giants Barcelona . Ticket sales from Arsenal's 60,272-seater Emirates Stadium, pictured, have helped them challenge financially .

"American investment firm Cain Hoy have pulled out of a proposed buy-out of Tottenham Hotspur after revealing they are no longer interested in making an offer. Spurs always strenuously denied that they were in talks over the sale of the club - insisting their dialogue with Cain Hoy centred solely around the prospect of investment for their  new stadium. The company, however, revealed that any bid is now dead in the water. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger: Groundshare with Spurs will not happen . Tottenham owner Joe Lewis (centre) and chairman Daniel Levy (right) Tottenham are hoping to move out of their current ground White Hart Lane for a new stadium . A statement read: 'On 12 September 2014, having previously approached Tottenham Hotspur with a proposal, Cain Hoy Enterprises, LLC ('Cain Hoy') confirmed that it was at the preliminary stages of assessing a cash offer for Tottenham Hotspur. 'Cain Hoy has subsequently terminated its assessment and accordingly is no longer considering making an offer for Tottenham Hotspur.' The Premier League club had distanced themselves from the speculation that suggested current owner Joe Lewis was willing to listen to offers of £1billion. Cain Hoy had until October 10 to indicate whether it will make a formal offer or indicate that its interest in Spurs is at an end, as it did on Thursday. However, it did leave the prospect of a return for Spurs open.

The project, adjacent to their existing White Hart Lane ground, hit problems earlier in the month when it was revealed the ground was 'highly unlikely' to be ready for Spurs to move in at the start of the 2017-18 season. That means the club would need to find a temporary base for home matches as their own stadium was finished, with the Olympic Stadium, Wembley and stadium:mk all believed to have been under consideration. However, West Ham, the official tenants of the Olympic Stadium from 2016, would likely block a ground share with Spurs, who had also bid for the lease.

"After scoring all four goals in Brazil's 4-0 rout over Japan in Singapore on Wednesday, Neymar warned the rest of the footballing world that even he does not know where his talent stops. 'My hair is standing on end. It's a great feeling. I don't know my own limits,' Neymar told Marca. 'It makes me very happy to achieve this dream. I couldn't have even imagined this in my wildest of dreams. I'm very happy and I thank God,' the Barcelona striker said. Neymar celebrates one of his four goals as Brazil thrashed Japan in a 4-0 victory. Neymar points to the sky as his goals led Brazil to a resounding victory . Neymar needs 28 goals to beat Pele's record: . Pele: 77 goals, 92 caps . Ronaldo: 62 goals, 98 caps . Romario: 55 goals, 70 caps . Zico: 48 goals, 71 caps . Neymar: 40 goals, 58 caps . And Neymar said the talk from Brazil coach Dunga before the game inspired his team to put Japan to the sword. 'He told us that the best way to show respect to your opponents is to do everything you can to beat them. And that's what we did. 'I tried to score the goals, not for my personal success, but to try and help my team-mates and the Brazil team in general.' After scoring for the 40th time for Brazil in only his 58th appearance, Neymar will be confident of eventually passing Pele's record of 77 goals.

"Britain's biggest banks have admitted sending thousands of letters from fake debt collection agencies in a deliberate attempt to intimidate customers into paying up. In a series of letters to the Commons Treasury committee, several of the biggest names in banking admit they have sent misleading letters to tens of thousands of customers who are struggling to repay their debts. They now face the prospect of a full-scale inquiry by MPs, who have condemned the ‘menacing’ practice. Barclays chief Antony Jenkins acknowledged the bank had used a number of 'debt collection brands' to 'encourage' customers to settle their debts . Andrew Tyrie, Tory chairman of the Treasury committee said: ‘These letters seem to have been designed to pull the wool over consumers’ eyes. 'Many customers will have been understandably misled. What is more, from these responses it seems that this practice was widespread. Banks say that they have now stopped sending such correspondence but it should never have happened in the first place.’ Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins acknowledged the bank had used a number of ‘debt collection brands’ to ‘encourage’ customers to settle their debts. He appeared to acknowledge the practice was designed to intimidate, saying the letters were meant to indicate to customers ‘an escalation in the seriousness of the situation’ by suggesting that outside debt collectors had been called in. He said the aim was to ‘encourage the customer to re-engage’. But he also claimed the use of other brands helped alert customers who had stopped opening letters from the bank that they were in trouble. Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan said the letters ‘reflect what had become a common industry practice in a sector that had come to put its own interests above those of its customers’. Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said the letters 'seem to have been designed to pull the wool over consumers’ eyes' Mr McEwan said the bank had established an in-house solicitor Green & Co to help it collect debts. It also used the brands Triton Credit Services and Tamarisk Debt Management to fool customers into thinking they were dealing with outside agencies. Last year alone, Triton issued 423,000 letters to 119,000 customers, while Green & Co sent out a further 29,000 letters. He said he would not try to defend the practice, which has now been stopped. But he said it appeared to have been used to ‘attract our customers’ attention to the adverse consequences’ of not paying their debts. HSBC chief executive Alan Keir said the banking giant had used four separate in-house brands to suggest it had called in outside help in collecting debts. Mr Klein said the practice dated back to 1985 and only stopped in July this year after it was exposed by the Press. Thousands of HSBC customers struggling with their debts received letters from DG Solicitors, Metropolitan Collection Services Central Debt Recovery Unit and Payment Services Bureau. In each case, the letter was actually from a part of HSBC, although this was only made clear in the small print. Santander also admitted using a ‘separately branded identity’ when collecting debts, but insisted this had never involved posing as a legal firm. Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury committee, said it was clear that an inquiry was now needed into a practice that was ‘obviously designed to intimidate people’. Public anger over the practice erupted earlier this year when payday loan firm Wonga was ordered to ordered to pay £2.6 million in compensation to 45,000 customers last month, following an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The City of London Police are now investigating whether Wonga may have breached a number of laws, including the Theft Act and the Administration of Justice Act which outlaws the harassment of debtors. The move came after it emerged that Wonga, which charges interest of up to 4,000 per cent on loans, sent letters in the names of two fictitious law firms in a bid to pressure customers into settling their debts. It has since emerged that the practice is widespread among financial institutions, utilities and even some public bodies, such as the Student Loans Company, which has now stopped.","Admission made in several letters to the Commons Treasury committee .

"Andy Murray was made to work hard before claiming a straight-sets victory over Teymuraz Gabashvili to reach the second round of the Shanghai Masters. The 27-year-old Scot, seeded 11th here, triumphed with a 6-1, 7-5 win in an hour and 25 minutes as he continued his bid to qualify for the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London. After sailing through the first set, Murray started to struggle in the second, trailing 5-3 at one point to the Georgian qualifier before he struck back to record a win and set up a second-round meeting with Poland's Jerzy Janowicz. Andy Murray returns a shot as the British No 1 beats Teymuraz Gabashivili in Shanghai . Standings on Tuesday October 7 . 07. Berdych (Shanghai 2R v Gasquet) 3775 . 08.

Gabashvili took the first game of the second set before the 2013 Wimbledon champion gained some momentum to move 2-1 up and his Georgian opponent levelled the scores after the fourth. After some great tennis from both players in the fifth game, Gabashvili went 3-2 ahead as he started to make things difficult for the world number 11. The Georgian played for a good point, winning a rally as Murray failed to reach the ball near the net before the British number one lobbed the ball out at the back of the court as Gabashvili went 4-2 in front. Murray looked a little more comfortable as the set went on and won the next game but lost his way again, losing some valuable points following some big hits from his opponent, who moved 5-3 ahead. Playing for the set, Gabashvili began to lose his focus, tossing his racquet as he hit the net and Murray managed to pull a game back. It then looked like the Scot would succumb to frustration but - after twice having the advantage at deuce in the 10th game - he fought for the point to level matters once again. Murray has his eye firmly on the ball as he picks up a straight-set first-round victory in Shanghai . The under-pressure Gabashvili decided on a change of racquet as he tried to come back into the match but Murray moved 6-5 ahead to hold a strong position before the world number 52 began make a number of errors and the Scot advanced. Murray told Sky Sports 3: 'I started the match well and he wasn't in very much of a rhythm at the beginning and I was dictating a lot of the points and using good variety, and that helped. 'At the beginning of the second set I played a sloppy game on my serve and he gained some confidence from that and started playing better. He was timing the ball a lot better in the second set and I had to find a way to get through in the end. Murray acknowledges the crowd after sealing victory over Gabashvili at the Shanghai Masters . 'I started using a variety again at the end of the second set. I was using a lot more high balls up to his backhand and that was pushing him back off the baseline and I was able to dictate the points. 'It was a good start for me....but there's still some work to be done.' Murray moved up to ninth place in the race to reach the Finals as he followed up his tournament win in Shenzhen with a semi-final loss to Novak Djokovic in Beijing last week. Only the top eight in the standings at the end of the regular season are guaranteed a place at the O2 Arena next month, with Murray currently trailing eighth-placed Milos Raonic by 140 points.

Customers who pre-ordered can expect to receive their new phone as early as Friday, though some will have to wait until October to finally get their hands on the latest Apple model. The phones, which start at $199, will also be available on a walk-in basis beginning Friday at Apple retail stores, as well as AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless and other authorized Apple resellers. Unveiled last Wednesday, the latest addition to the Apple family is not wildly different than its predecessor, the aforementioned iPhone 5, though the new model is slimmer, has a larger screen made of 'ion strengthened glass,' and has a slightly longer battery life. For additional money, users can also get more memory on their phone. The biggest change however is the introduction of Apple Pay, which allows owners to use their iPhone 6 to pay in stores and within apps in an easy, secure, and private way. The Financial Times reported today that this system is expected to make the already ridiculously rich company even richer, with two people familiar with the non-public terms of agreement claiming Apple will make 15 cents off of every $100 purchase.

"Ferrari's Fernando Alonso gave a teasing hint about his Formula One future  by saying the decision would seem obvious once announced and he was unlikely to drive for a Mercedes-powered team. 'I'm not in a hurry...I understand the curiosity, and I understand, for the fans, the news that can be around the future,' the Spaniard told reporters at the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. 'But do not worry, do not worry. Just relax, enjoy, and when it's time to know it, you will know it. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso (right) says it is 'unlikely' that he will be driving for Mercedes next season . 'My mind is set, for the last two or three months, and when you know you will understand that probably it was very obvious what I would do,' added the double world champion. In a separate interview with NBC television, Alonso said 'I don't think so' when asked if he would be driving for a team with Mercedes engines. That would appear to leave only a return to McLaren, who are starting a new partnership with Honda, or staying at Ferrari as the 33-year-old's realistic options of a drive given that Renault-powered Red Bull have announced a 2015 line-up. Alonso has been at Ferrari since 2010, but has never won a Championship with the Italian team . McLaren have said repeatedly that they have not yet made any decision about their drivers. Although Alonso has a contract at Ferrari until the end of 2016, he is expected to leave at the end of the year to make way for four-times champion Sebastian Vettel unless current team mate Kimi Raikkonen leaves. Raikkonen, Ferrari's 2007 champion, has a contract for 2015 but has been eclipsed by Alonso this year. The Spanish driver could yet remain with Ferrari, but only if Kimi Raikkonen leaves the team . Vettel announced last week that he was leaving Red Bull at the end of the year, with that team's principal Christian Horner saying the driver was heading for Ferrari. Neither Ferrari nor the German have confirmed anything. Maintaining the intrigue, Alonso also said he wanted to do his best for the future of Ferrari. 'My decision...was to help this fantastic team, and I'm extremely happy with the things that will come,' he said. Christian Horner said Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel is joining Ferrari, but it hasn't yet been officially announced .","Fernando Alonso set to leave Ferrari at the end of the season .

"Wasps are bracing themselves for protests from angry supporters on Sunday as the club play their first match since the controversial announcement that they will be moving to Coventry. The former London club confirmed on Wednesday they will leave Adams Park in Wycombe — where they have resided for the past 12 years — and move to the Ricoh Arena in December after a multi-million purchase backed by car manufacturer Land Rover. Many fans of Wasps, who host Bath on Sunday, are furious at the decision to relocate 80 miles north, despite promises of free coach journeys from Wycombe for future home games. Wasps' James Haskell, Dai Young and Andy Goode during the announcement of a new stadium and sponsor . 'Obviously we're expecting a mixed reaction. Moving is not a decision we've taken lightly and we'd like supporters to come on this journey with us,' said Dai Young, Wasps director of rugby. 'Moving will safeguard the future of Wasps and hopefully put Wasps back up there competing with the best in England and Europe. 'This was the only decision we could take if Wasps are to be about in the years ahead. The alternative doesn't bear thinking about . 'I fail to see how any supporter would rather see their club go bust than move, although I understand their initial disappointment. 'We want to assure fans that we have looked at every option and haven't taken this decision likely. We totally value their support.' Young, Director of rugby at Wasps talks to the press after the announcement of the move . Of gravest concern to fans has been the lack of consultation over the move and the location of the new home away from Wasps' traditional roots in London and the south east. 'Hopefully when the emotion dies down, people will take a breath and look at the reality,' Young said. 'And the reality is: do you want your club to be about in 20 or 50 years time, or do you want your club to go out of business? 'I appreciate it has been an emotional week for many supporters, but I hope we can all channel those emotions into supporting the team on the field.'","Wasps set to leave their current home in Wycombe for Coventry .

"England finished third in the opening round of the HSBC Sevens World Series on the Gold Coast after losing to eventual winners Fiji in the semi-finals. Simon Amor's men began the final day with a stunning 31-7 rout of defending champions New Zealand, with captain Phil Burgess scoring two tries and others coming from Alex Gray, Christian Lewis-Pratt and Dan Norton.

However, that was as good as it got for England as the Pacific Islanders ran in three unanswered tries, two from Osea Kolinisau and one from Jerry Tuwai, to lead 26-7 at half-time. England began the second half with plenty of possession in the middle of the park but Fiji struck in quick succession through Savenaca Rawaca and Isake Katonibau to stretch their lead before Apisai Naqalevu and Apisalome Waqatabu added others late on as Fiji ran out 48-7 winners.

"Barry Bannan insists he can copy Alan Hutton and cling on to his Scotland spot even though he has been left out in the cold by his club. The Crystal Palace midfielder has played just three times for the Eagles this season and only once - in a Capital One Cup defeat to Newcastle - since new boss Neil Warnock took over at Selhurst Park last month. But Gordon Strachan has kept faith with the 24-year-old, naming him in the starting line-up for last month's opening Euro 2016 qualifier with Germany and then recalling him to his squad for the upcoming double-header with Georgia and Poland. The midfielder Barry Bannan wants to keep his place in the Scotland squad despite struggling at club level . Bannan (here fending off Stewart Downing) is nowhere near nailing down a spot in Crystal Palace's side . Alan Hutton managed to hold down his international spot recently - despite not playing for Aston Villa . Bannan, though, is not worried that his lack of game time will eventually cost him and pointed to former Aston Villa team-mate Hutton as a shining example. The former Rangers full-back did not play a single game for his club last year as Villa boss Paul Lambert snubbed him completely, yet still made eight appearances for Scotland. Bannan - speaking at the Dark Blues' Mar Hall base ahead of Saturday's Ibrox clash with the Georgians - said: 'You've got to look at guys like Alan Hutton; in the past he wasn't playing for his club and was coming away and playing really well [for Scotland]. 'The only thing I can do, when I come here, is do my all in training to get into the team. 'I keep myself fit. It's a shame I'm not playing but hopefully playing well here will impress the gaffer and I'll get the chance. 'I think [Neil Warnock] had just got the job the week I was coming away for the game against Germany. 'You obviously think if you're playing against Germany and doing well then you'll have a chance when you go back. 'But Palace were doing well at the time and it's just a case of waiting for your chance and taking it when you get in there.' After Georgia visit Glasgow, the Scots will then turn their attentions to taking on Poland in Warsaw on Tuesday. Strachan's men will be desperate to kick-start their Group D campaign with two wins having suffered defeat to world champions Germany in last month's opener but Bannan is not looking any further than the weekend clash with Temuri Ketsbaia's side. Hutton his enjoying a renaissance at right back for Villa and is set to play for Scotland this weekend . He said: 'We are just looking forward to the game on Saturday. We will not get carried away with the games coming after Saturday. 'We will only focus on Georgia and hopefully we can get the win there.' With Hampden still to be put back together after hosting the Commonwealth Games athletics sessions this summer, Saturday's match will be staged at Ibrox. The Dark Blues last called the Rangers' stadium home in November 1996 when they beat Sweden 1-0 with a John McGinlay goal. And Bannan would take a similar result this time, saying: 'I've never played at Ibrox myself so it will be something different for me and a lot of the lads. But no matter where you play, the Scotland fans are always the same and provide a great atmosphere.'","Barry Bannan is struggling to get into Neil Warnock's Crystal Palace team .

"Single men looking for love and intimacy tend to rely on dating apps or chance meetings to find 'the one'. But those feeling especially lonely - and desperate - might be tempted by a more immediate, and definitely more unnerving, solution. A bizarre pillow shaped like a pair of girls legs coupled with an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset is now offering hope to men who do not want to spend the evenings alone sitting on the sofa. A bizarre pillow shaped like a pair of girls legs coupled with a virtual reality headset is offering hope to men who do not want to spend the evenings alone sitting on the sofa - in the form of a pair of legs that users interact with in virtual reality. Pictured is a man testing the virtual girlfriend developed by a Japanese firm . The idea to create the virtual girlfriend for lonely men was developed by the Japanese development firm Up Frontier that offers the chance to sit next to a blonde virtual girlfriend. Oculus was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey. It is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games, but for other activities as well. Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. The firm is developing the leading VR headset - with a developer version on sale for $350 (£210). It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg . The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who have already unveiled their own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year. The virtual partners is based on the Unity-chan cartoon character, which is the mascot for an open-source cross-platform game engine called Unity designed by Unity Technologies Japan. Together with a ‘lap pillow’, which mimics the shape of the character’s legs, users can rest their head on ‘her’ legs both in the virtual world and real life - sort of. Anybody wearing the headset and sitting alongside the girls lap can rest their head in her lap, talk to her or just sit there - even if the rest of her is missing. The lap pillow is known as the Hizamakura and is designed to look and feel like a kneeling pair of female legs. The user supposedly has the feeling that they are sat next to a virtual girlfriend, in the absence of the real thing. And during the experience the character will also talk to them, albeit in Japanese. The character in the game will recognise the user when they lie down and stand up, but if they walk away from her she’ll punish them with a virtual roundhouse kick. They can walk around in the in-game environment using a video-game controller.

The Oculus Rift company was recently acquired by Facebook and received its early funding via Kickstarter in order to develop the high-tech device. The pilot version of the virtual girlfriend offers a scenario of sitting on a bench by the seaside complete with seagulls although other scenarios are currently in production, as well as other looks for the girlfriend. A short video created to showcase what the device can do was road-tested by designer Nico Douga and simultaneously shows what he is seeing on screen and the reality. His verdict was it was a little embarrassing, and the woman's annoying voice needed work, but it apparently had potential.

"Ian Bell would like to continue working with Graham Gooch — who was sacked as England batting coach earlier this year — after a one-to-one session before last week’s third Test proved an instant hit. The England No 4 made a sparkling 167 in Southampton, his first Test hundred for 20 innings, to set up a crushing win over India — and credited his revival to a two-hour net with Gooch at Edgbaston. Bell had been one of the senior players failing to do justice to their talents this summer, averaging just 25 in four games against Sri Lanka and the Indians. But, two days after the nadir of England’s 95-run defeat in the second Test at Lord’s, he invited Gooch up to Birmingham for a session on Warwickshire’s colts ground. Tonderful: Ian Bell celebrates his first Test hundred for 20 innings at the Ageas Bowl . Credit: Graham Gooch (right) is still held in high esteem by England's batsmen and helped Bell find his form . Not cutting the mustard: Bell was out at Trent Bridge when caught in two minds . VIDEO Cook praises England . ‘We have a really good set-up with England, but sometimes it’s nice to have another set of eyes,’ Bell told Sportsmail. ‘I used to have Neil Abberley here at Warwickshire, someone you could chat through a few things with. Because they’re not so attached to the game, there’s less emotion involved, and it’s nice to do that with Goochy — a net session with someone who can help me reconnect in a different way.’ Gooch, whose tally of 20 Test hundreds was surpassed by Bell at the Ageas Bowl, was hurt when Alastair Cook told him at the end of April that his services were no longer required by England. But Bell’s decision to seek help outside the bubble reflects the high esteem in which Gooch continues to be held. ‘He does one-on-one net sessions really well,’ said Bell. ‘He never goes through the motions. He puts you under the pump, which is where you are in a Test match. He never gets over-complicated or technical. It’s about making sure you’re in the right frame of mind. ‘As Goochy always says, you should always be looking to score runs, not just to survive. It’s nice to refresh that from time to time. Generally we’re always exchanging text messages. ‘And if he’s available I try to make the most of him for a couple of hours. If I get the chance I’d like to keep doing that.’ Reversal of fortune: A confident Bell reverse sweeps Ravindra Jadeja at Southampton . Going over the top: Bell was confident enough to play some shots in the second innings at the Ageas Bowl . Ian Bell moved into England’s top ten Test run scorers against India last week. His 7091 took him past Andrew Strauss. Gooch was not Bell’s only net buddy in the lead-up to the Southampton Test. After seeking permission from Cook and coach Peter Moores, Bell took it upon himself to offer his former Warwickshire team-mate Moeen Ali help with his off-breaks. The upshot? Second-innings figures of six for 67, the best by an England spinner against India since Ray Illingworth at Lord’s in 1967. Bell said: ‘Having watched him bowl in the first Test, and having faced him in the nets, it felt like he was bowling in the Test as he was in the nets. ‘The important thing for me was trying to get him clear on what his role was at different times in the game. ‘Swanny was brilliant at having two game plans: hold up an end for the seamers when conditions aren’t in your favour, then bowl aggressively when they are. Moeen is naturally aggressive: he gets spin on the ball and good shape. Highs and lows: Bell jumps for joy after scoring an Ashes ton last summer but struggled Down Under (right) ‘He’s got his pace up a little bit to 55mph, from 51 when he started. But on the Hawk-Eye data he’s also getting more drop and drift. ‘The important thing for me is not pace but energy. When Swanny bowled, his arm speed was full of energy, so the ball drops. With dismissals like when Moeen nicked off Pujara and Kohli — world-class players of spin — the ball deceived them on length. He wants to learn and he’s not far away.’ England’s unofficial vice-captain, Bell was named in some quarters as a possible leader until Cook ended his own drought last week with scores of 95 and 70 not out and his side’s first win in 11 Tests. But he says it was not a scenario he gave any credence to. ‘I heard it muttered around, but I didn’t pay it much attention because obviously I believe Cooky’s the right man. He’s won Test series in India, he’s won an Ashes series and he’s 29. I think he’s the right bloke to captain England.’ Vintage: Bell is an ambassador for Hardys Wine . If the loyalty is to be expected, then Bell’s own lack of runs made his potential promotion just as unlikely. But his 167 — after he was lucky to escape an lbw shout from Pankaj Singh before he had scored — symbolised the about-turn in Southampton which Bell describes as ‘a perfect five days’. And he said the possible ban hanging over Jimmy Anderson during the third Test following his altercation in the Trent Bridge pavilion with Ravindra Jadeja did England no harm. ‘Maybe it has brought us tighter together,’ he said. ‘No one’s really discussed it too much. Jimmy wanted it that way, to focus on the cricket. But hopefully it will keep us tight as a unit. Jimmy was at the top of his game — he must prefer those headlines.’ When the fourth Test starts in Manchester on Thursday, England will be hoping for more of the same.

"John O’Shea knows a thing or two about stability – he has been at the heart of the Republic of Ireland’s defence for 13 years and is set to win his 100th cap against world champions Germany. But it is at club level where he is enjoying the settled surrounds of Sunderland manager Gus Poyet, who replaced firebrand Paolo Di Canio exactly one year ago. O’Shea, like many of the squad, fell out with the Italian before his inevitable dismissal. Under Poyet, however, the 33-year-old is captain and a certain starter. John O'Shea is preparing top make his 100th appearance for Ireland, he would be the sixth Irishman to do so . The Black Cats have lost just once in the Premier League this season and, after last year’s narrow escape from relegation, O’Shea is enjoying Poyet’s calming influence. ‘It is much more stable now and the club needed that,’ said the former Manchester United centre back. ‘The manager showed at Brighton that he knows what he is doing and the attitude of the gaffer and his staff is amazing. The Sunderland captain praised  the calming influence of Gus Poyet after Paolo Di Canio's tempestuous tenure . ‘They want the players to go on and improve and build themselves up individually and as a team. Hopefully we are doing that. The manager has built up a tight-knit squad.’ O’Shea will earn his 99th international cap against Gibraltar during Saturday’s Euro 2016 qualifier before his milestone match in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday. It is, though, a point of regret that only three of his caps have come at a major tournament, the European Championships in 2012 when Ireland crashed out at the group stage. ‘Statistics are there and they mean a lot but ultimately you want to be out there winning games,’ he said. The former Manchester United defender trains with the Sunderland players at The Academy of Light . ‘I have only been to one major tournament with Ireland so to get to the Euro finals with my country would be very special. That’s what I’m focussing on. It will be a big thing for the future of the young ones coming through as well, so we have got to try and get there.’ Of his potential landmark, he added: ‘My 100th cap could come against the world champions, so that’s a nice game for it to happen. I’d only be the sixth Irishman to do it as well. ‘It will be something I will look back on more when I have finished in the game and not playing. It will be special at the time for my family, friends, old clubs and a very proud moment.’ The only international tournament O'Shea played in with Ireland was the European Championships in 2012 .","John O'shea could win 100th cap for Ireland against Germany .

"The most decorated player in Premier League history added yet another accolade to his ever-growing collection on Tuesday as Ryan Giggs became the latest recipient of the Legend of Football award. Manchester United's assistant manager collected his gong in person at the HMV Football Extravaganza, an annual event designed to bring the football and music communities together to raise money for charity Nordoff Robbins. Giggs, who hung up his boots at the end of last season to become Louis van Gaal's No 2, is the fourth United legend to win the award, following in the footsteps of Sir Alex Ferguson, Eric Cantona and Denis Law. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ryan Giggs speaking before receiving his award . Ryan Giggs (left) is the latest recipient of the Legend of Football award, with Bryan Robson handing it over . Speaking ahead of the event, Giggs said: 'It's an honour and privilege to be presented with the Legend of Football Award, particularly when I look back at the list of previous winners. 'I am looking forward to the event, celebrating with friends and colleagues and raising money for Nordoff Robbins, which is a really incredible cause.' Patrick Kluivert and his wife Rossana Lima were also at the event at the London Hilton . The 40-year-old was joined on stage by his friends and fellow members of the Class of '92 Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville, each of whom paid tribute to his extraordinary career at Old Trafford. But it was former United and England captain Bryan Robson who handed over the award to Giggs, a year after Brazil legend Pele was honoured in the same way. And although he wasn't there in person, ex-Red Devils manager Ferguson appeared on a big screen to say some warm words about his former player. Despite the imminent return of Premier League action this weekend, Giggs and a host of managers found time to visit the London Hilton on Park Lane to enjoy the ceremony and show their support for the specialist music therapy charity. Top-flight bosses Sam Allardyce, Gus Poyet and Sean Dyche were all in attendance, while former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer and ex-Holland star Patrick Kluivert were also pictured arriving at the glitzy bash. Guests were treated to a performance from Welsh rockers Stereophonics before being given the opportunity to bid in a fundraising auction with a variety of football-based prizes up for grabs, including a kids training session with Giggs at Carrington and a behind-the-scenes experience at the Emirates for Arsenal's clash with West Ham on March 14. Now in its 19th year, the Football Extravaganza has raised more than £6million for Nordoff Robbins.","Ryan Giggs won the accolade at the HMV Football Extravaganza .

"Pupils as young as four were forced to walk over graffiti which read 'whites not welcome' when they arrived at school yesterday. The message was found on the entrance path leading to Prince of Wales Primary School, in Enfield, north London. Hundreds of children saw the words but Enfield Council has said it has since been removed. Police are now also investigating the incident. Offensive: Pupils as young as four were forced to walk across graffiti which read 'no whites allowed' when they arrived at Prince Wales Primary School in Enfield, north London . However, some parents claim this is not the first time graffiti on this nature has appeared at the school. Mother Jasmin Nathan told the Evening Standard: 'I have two sons aged nine and six who both attend the school and my eldest immediately noticed it before I did and was very inquisitive about it, which broke my heart. 'I've been worried all day about how this may affect his school day or god-forbid, any conflict in the playground as children can be unintentionally very spiteful, especially when discussing things they don't have the mental capacity to understand.' According to headteacher Jan Bless, other messages appeared along the same stretch of road. He said: 'This was part of a wider graffiti trail which stretched about a quarter of a mile. The message was found on the entrance path leading to Prince of Wales Primary School, in Enfield . 'We immediately contacted the police and local authority. 'It seems the person who did this felt like they needed to say something but this has no reflection on the school. 'Parents were very distressed and shocked. We are very disappointed. It's not something that was solely directed at the school. 'In my opinion someone felt they had something to say and unfortunately the school was along the path. The message does not reflect our school.' Other examples of graffiti along the stretch of road include messages which read 'racist scum' and Enfield Council loves an imigrant' (sic). ...'Many children and parents have been upset by this graffiti and how it still remains on the school path beggars belief' Ms Nathan, concerned mother . Ms Nathan said: 'Two of the offending messages have been removed but as you can see a number of them still remain. 'Many children and parents have been upset by this graffiti and how it still remains on the school path beggars belief, particularly when parents have been very vocal to school staff about their concerns. 'The school is multi-cultural and this has offended pretty much everybody in some way, and the school and council have a duty of care towards our children to ensure they don't have to see racial abuse scrawled across the school path.' A spokeswoman from Enfield Council said: 'We have removed this graffiti as a matter of urgency. 'We have a large multicultural and harmonious community in Enfield which embraces its diversity. 'Racism of any form is unwelcome in this borough. We’d like to thank the school for bringing this matter to our attention and enabling us to deal with it promptly. 'It is very difficult to prevent graffiti, but cases of graffiti in Enfield have dropped to an all time low in recent years. 'Our policy is to remove graffiti as rapidly as possible with a particular focus on removing offensive graffiti. 'We have reported this matter to the police who are investigating it.' Last week a sign appeared outside Bartlett Park in Poplar, which read: 'Do not walk your dog here. 'Muslims don't like dogs. This is an Islamic area now.' Labour Member of Parliament Jim Fitzpatrick alerted police and the local mayor about the sign after it was flagged up by one of the residents in his east London constituency. Police say an investigation is now underway to find out who put it up. An MP complained after a sign posted near a park warned dog-walkers to stay out of 'Islamic areas'","Message found on path leading to Prince of Wales Primary School, in Enfield .

"Ikechi Anya feels Scotland have given themselves a good platform to build on in their European Championship qualifying campaign. Scotland have four points from a possible nine following their 2-2 draw in Poland on Tuesday night, but sit above world champions Germany on goal difference in third place in Group D. They have got two tough away games out of the way and can move level on points with the Republic of Ireland when they host Martin O'Neill's team at Celtic Park on November 14. Ikechi Anya, who set up Shaun Maloney's goal in Scotland's 2-2 draw with Poland, shows neat control . Anya, right, celebrates with Scotland team-mates Maloney, left, and Steven Naismith, centre, during the game . Anya, who set up Shaun Maloney's goal in Warsaw, told www.uefa.com: 'We took a lot of heart from the Germany performance (2-1 loss in Dortmund last month), but obviously we didn't get any points. On Saturday we beat Georgia 1-0 and now we got this point. 'So four points from a possible nine, taking into account that we've played Germany and Poland, is a good return and we'll try to build on that come November.' Scotland survived a late onslaught after Arkadiusz Milik cancelled out Steven Naismith's goal with 14 minutes left, but manager Gordon Strachan was pleased with his team's overall display. Scotland held on for a point in Warsaw after conceding a late equaliser to Poland forward Arkadiusz Milik . Although Poland created more chances, the official UEFA statistics show Scotland had the majority of possession and a pass completion rate of 92 per cent. Scotland looked comfortable on the ball and Maloney's goal was the culmination of two passes from Steven Fletcher and Anya that ripped Poland apart in an instant. And the Watford winger reckons the Scots can be pleased with their night's work. 'At the start of the match, to get a point in Poland, who had just beaten Germany 2-0 and we know how good they are after playing them in March, the majority of Scotland fans would be happy,' Anya said. Milik, pictured celebrating his equalising goal, lashed home from the edge of the box in the 76th minute .

'On saying that, when you've got 15 minutes left and you're 2-1 up away from home, it's a bit disappointing, but I'm sure we'll reflect when we meet up in November, that it will be a good point come the end of the campaign. 'They went ahead with a good goal, but we showed a lot of character to bring it back to 1-1 and even to take it to 2-1. 'Towards the end I think we were a bit tired and they managed to get their second, but we showed a lot of character to hold on for 2-2 because towards the end they were probably the better side.'

"'Private': Ranjit Singh shuns the media spotlight but has been thrust into the limelight after claims his 2 Sisters Food Group has sold contaminated chicken . The man who controls chicken factories at the centre of a major hygiene inquiry is a ‘secretive’ self-made millionaire. Ranjit Singh, who is known as ‘the chicken king’, has an estimated fortune of £190million. His company, 2 Sisters Food Group, is under investigation by supermarket chains following claims that it is distributing contaminated chicken to be sold on the high street, it emerged yesterday. It has been alleged that chickens that fell on to the floor at two factories were routinely put back into the food chain and that feathers, guts and offal were left to pile up for hours while production continued at a factory in Wales. The company, which the 46-year-old built from ‘a small-scale frozen retail cutting operation’, now controls about 20 per cent of the UK poultry market. Mr Singh is the fifth richest person in the Midlands and fifth richest Asian in the UK. He is described by neighbours and colleagues as a ‘secretive man’ who shuns media attention. He is a director of some 50 companies and subsidiaries, including Harry Ramsden’s fast food chain. The father-of-five is also the chairman of Northern Foods, the company behind Goodfellas pizzas and Fox’s Biscuits, which 2 Sisters acquired in 2011 for nearly £350million. In the past year, 2 Sisters – run by Mr Singh and his wife Baljinder Boparan – has made a £150million profit. As well as reports of poor hygiene and contamination of products, employees have complained about poor working conditions and low wages. Mr Singh and his wife live in a £1.2million house in the prosperous area of Little Aston near Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands. It is known as an enclave of footballers and successful businessmen. Mr Singh’s six-bedroom iron-gated property is undergoing an eight-week renovation. A neighbour said yesterday: ‘They are a very private family who have been living there for a very long time. We barely see him because he is always working.’ But in 2006, the family were thrust into the limelight when their son, Antonio Singh Boparan, 21 at the time, almost killed a toddler in a car crash while speeding at 72mph in a 30mph zone. He was jailed for 21 months after leaving one-year-old Cerys Edwards paralysed and brain damaged. Supermarkets have are investigating claims contaminated chicken is being sold. (Stock picture) The family run the Boparan Trust, set up to ‘help wipe out child poverty, work with social services and professionals on programmes for disabled youngsters, help vulnerable children and improve education in deprived communities.’ Mr Singh was yesterday unavailable for comment. Regarding the allegations of poor hygiene and working conditions in its factories, a spokesman for 2 Sisters said: ‘The allegations about our processing sites are untrue, misleading and inaccurate. 'Both have British Retail Consortium “A” grade food standards certifications, based on a number of announced and unannounced visits.’ AN inquiry into the risk of dirty chicken reaching supermarkets and restaurants was demanded yesterday. Two of Britain’s biggest chicken producers were accused this week of suspect practices that could allow the food poisoning bug campylobacter to reach the high street. The allegations, reported in the Guardian, related to two factories run by the 2 Sisters Food Group and a farm contracted to supply birds to Faccenda Foods. Labour’s food and farming spokesman, Huw Irranca-Davies, said: ‘Labour is calling on the Food Standards Agency to carry out an immediate and thorough investigation.’ 2 Sisters Food Group said: ‘There is no campylobacter contamination or problems at our sites.’ Faccenda Foods said: ‘We have committed significant resources to the development of innovative interventions to reduce campylobacter.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ranjit Singh's 2 Sisters Food Group has 20 per cent of the poultry market .

"Vow: Humza Yousaf, Scotland's Minister for External Affairs, told William Hague action must be taken against Uganda's new 'draconian law' tightening constraints on homosexuals . Scotland has vowed to offer asylum to gay Ugandans facing life-imprisonment under the country's new oppressive set of laws. Humza Yousaf, Scotland's Minister for External Affairs, announced the plan in an open letter to UK Foreign Secretary William Hague - urging him to follow suit. It comes just weeks before he is due to meet senior members of the Ugandan government at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer. The anti-homosexuality legislation was enacted earlier this week, strengthening the country's already strict laws relating to gay people. President Museveni also ordered one of the country's newspapers to publish a list of the so-called top 200 homosexuals, including some that had not identified themselves as gay. Currently, international treaties say people must prove they have a 'well-founded fear' of persecution for reasons of race, religion, ethnicity or political opinion if they are to obtain asylum. Urging Mr Hague to challenge the Commonwealth nation, Mr Yousaf wrote: 'Scotland will play her part in providing asylum for those seeking refuge from this draconian legislation.' Today he added: 'The Scottish Government is deeply concerned the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda has been signed into law. 'This is a huge step back for equality and I have written to the UK Government asking them to make the strongest possible representations to the government of Uganda. 'I have also urged the UK Foreign Secretary to offer asylum to any Ugandans who suffer threat or persecution as a result of the legislation. 'It goes without saying that Scotland, . where possible, will play her part and assist the UK Government in . providing asylum for those seeking refuge from this draconian law.' Uproar: The new legislation, passed this week, have criminalised the 'promotion of homosexuality'. Activists have blasted the laws but, facing life-imprisonment, cannot show their faces . Homosexuality was already illegal in Uganda, but the new legislation now includes lesbians and criminalises 'the promotion of homosexuality'. Mr Yousaf's move was welcomed by the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC). General secretary Grahame Smith said: 'The oppressive legislation enacted by the Ugandan government criminalising the LGBT community is an affront to freedom and equality. 'The STUC welcomes this initiative by the . Scottish Government and we would urge the UK Government to support this . proposal to allow Ugandans, under threat of imprisonment as a . consequence of their sexuality, to find refuge in Scotland.' In a previous statement, Foreign Secretary William Hague has berated discrimination in Uganda . The Kaleidoscope Trust, an LGBT pressure group, told The Herald: 'We . have always felt the Games had an important part to play in tackling the . scandal of LGBT abuses in the Commonwealth and welcome the Scottish . Government taking the bull by the horns.' Last year, judges at the European Court of Justice said homosexuals facing imprisonment may have sufficient grounds to be allowed to stay in the EU. The existence of laws imprisoning homosexuals 'may constitute an act of persecution per se' if they are routinely enforced, the court said. Mr Hague has yet to comment but in a previous statement he said: 'We ask the government of Uganda to protect all its . citizens and encourage tolerance, equality and respect. 'We will continue . to press the government of Uganda to defend human rights for all, . without discrimination on any grounds.'","Humza Yousaf, Scotland External Affairs Minister, tells William Hague to act .

"A jihadist who went to fight in Syria after being radicalised in a French prison has been arrested on suspicion of shooting three people dead at the Jewish museum in Brussels. Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was captured by chance at Marseille coach station on Friday during a routine customs check. His bag was found to contain a Kalashnikov assault rifle of the sort used in the Brussels attack on May 24, a revolver and a wearable video camera. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Mehdi Nemmouche (pictured), 29, was captured by chance at Marseille coach station on Friday . On it was a short video showing the two guns and a voiceover in which an unseen man claims responsibility for the killings and expresses regret that the device had failed to record the shootings. Nemmouche, who has barely said a word since his arrest, was known to have spent much of last year fighting in Syria, but had been left free to travel around Europe. London was among the cities he visited, said Paris prosecutor Francois Mollins. Referring to a growing problem threatening Britain and France, Mr Mollins said: 'This affair illustrates the danger posed by radicalised individuals who go to fight in Syria.' The French have insisted that they were unable to keep Nemmouche under surveillance following his last release from prison in 2012 because he travelled to Syria, and then lived in Belgium. CCTV: A surveillance camera shows a man shooting at the Jewish museum in Brussels, Belgium, on May 24 . Scene: The Jewish museum in Brussels. All four shooting victims were hit by bullets to the face and neck . Nemmouche, who is a French national . originally from the northern town of Roubaix but currently of no fixed . abode, has been compared to French Algerian Al Qaeda terrorist Mohammed . Merah who murdered seven people three years ago before committing . suicide. 'This affair illustrates the danger posed by radicalised individuals who go to fight in Syria' Francois Mollins, Paris prosecutor . Merah, like Nemmouche from a . working class council estate background, was left largely unsupervised . by the authorities, despite having spent time in a terrorist training . camp in Afghanistan. Nemmouche's coach, which arrived at the Saint-Charles station in Marseille, had come from Amsterdam, via Brussels. He is said to have 'given himself up to police' without a fight once the customs officials alerted them. Investigation: Forensic experts examine the site of the shooting at the Jewish museum in Brussels on May 24 . Tribute: Flowers bearing the words, 'Thou shalt not kill' are set amid candles outside the Jewish Museum . Nemmouche is said to have converted to Islam after serving time in prison for armed robbery. His former lawyer, Soulifa Badaoui, today said she remembered an 'intelligent, quick-witted' man who was 'respectful and without any particular religious conviction'. Nemmouche is now being held in a high-security police station, on suspicion of a variety of offences, including murder and having links with a known terrorist group, believed to be Al Qaeda. He is expected to be extradicted to Belgium, where he will face a criminal trial and a possible life sentence. Mira and Emmanuel Riva, an Israeli couple . in their 50s from Tel Aviv, were two of the killer's victims. They had . worked for the Israeli government in the past. Political reaction: Belgium Interior Minister Joelle Milquet (left) and French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve address the media in Paris yesterday . Giving an update: Belgian Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw speaks at a news conference in Brussels . All four victims of the shooting, who included a French woman who did volunteer work at the museum and a 24-year-old Belgian museum employee, were hit by bullets to the face and neck. Three died instantly, while there have been conflicting reports about the fourth. Some say he is dead, others that he is 'clinically dead' or 'in a coma'. Three chilling CCTV videos show the gunman, wearing a cap and sunglasses, calmly walk into the museum, remove a gun from a bag, and then start shooting. The attack, which lasted just a minute and a half, also left around a dozen other terrified museum visitors in a state of extreme distress. In 2012 anti-Semitic fanatic Mohamed .

Flashback: In 2012 anti-Semitic fanatic Mohamed Merah (pictured) gunned down seven people in and around the south western city of Toulouse before being killed in a shootout with police . Among the victims of the 23-year-old Al-Qaeda supporter, who filmed his crimes on a GoPro camera, were three Jewish children and a rabbi who were murdered in front of their school. In the face of such savagery, security groups have launched numerous clamp-downs on extremists, including in cities like Belgium, which has a large Muslim population. Anti-Semitic attacks have become all too common in Europe over recent years, with Islamic radicals often behind them. French and British Islamic radicals are among those who have travelled to Syria to fight in the country's civil war. Politicians have expressed constant fears that these battle-hardened 'jihadists' will return to their homeland to carry out terrorist crimes.","Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, captured by chance at Marseille coach station .

"Nearly one in 10 couples are now ethnically mixed, according to an official analysis revealed today. It said there are 2.3 million people living as part of a mixed couple, nine per cent of all those who live as part of a couple, and their numbers have gone up by more than a third in a decade. The figures on inter-ethnic relationships, compiled by the Office for National Statistics, suggest that racial prejudice is a diminishing force and more and more people are happy to share their lives with someone from a different ethnic background. The report also found that 833,000 children, some seven per cent of those under 16 or still at school in England and Wales, are being brought up in a home led by an ethnically-mixed couple. The count of ethnically mixed couples was taken from the 2011 national census results. The most likely people to be living in a mixed relationship are those whose parents were ethnically mixed themselves, the report said. ‘People from the mixed groups are themselves likely to be the result of inter-ethnic relationships that have emerged in the last 60 years from post-war immigration patterns,’ the ONS report said. ‘These groups have a much younger age profile than some of the other ethnic groups and 80 per cent of the people in this group were born in the UK.’ The number of ethnically mixed couples went up from 1,709,000 at the time of the 2001 census to 2,327,000 in 2011, the report said. The 36 per cent increase in numbers meant the percentage of mixed couples in the population went up from seven per cent to nine per cent of all couples. Around eight per cent of married couples were from mixed backgrounds, and 12 per cent of cohabiting couples. The ONS analysis counted different white groups such as ‘white British,’ ‘white Irish’ and ‘other whites’ - including people from parts of Europe, America and Austalia - as ethnically different. However, the report said that despite an increase of more than a million in the number of people classed as ‘other white’ as a result of Eastern European immigration, the percentage of other white people in mixed relationships went down between 2001 and 2011. The other white group, the report said, is made up mostly of people born outside Britain, and includes half a million Polish people. The group ‘contains more recent migrants who have had less time to establish mixed relationships,’ the ONS said. Numbers of men and women in mixed relationships were broadly the same across most ethnic groups. ‘However, there were some differences between the sexes for some ethnic groups,’ the report said. ‘The biggest differences were found in the Chinese group where women were twice as likely – 39 per cent – to be in an inter-ethnic relationship as men.’ By contrast, Arab men were more likely to be in a mixed relationship than Arab women. Fewer than a third of those in mixed relationships are over the age of 50. ‘Older people may have more traditional views on inter-ethnic relationships and they were also more likely to have entered into a relationship at a time when England and Wales were less ethnically diverse,’ the report said. ‘Younger people are more likely to have grown up in the UK exposed to other ethnic groups, and to respond to observed changes in society, in terms of increasing diversity.’ The most common inter-ethnic relationships were between white British, other white, and white Irish people, involving over 500,000 people. Just under 1.5 million people were in unclassified ethnically mixed relationships.","More than 2million people living as part of a mixed couple .

"Andy Murray's success in China may be nudging him towards a place in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals but he maintains securing a qualification place for the London showpiece could not be further from his mind. Murray begins his campaign in the Shanghai Masters against Georgia's Teymuraz Gabashvili on Tuesday having moved up to ninth place in the race to reach the Finals, after following up his tournament win in Shenzhen with a semi-final loss to Novak Djokovic in Beijing last week. Only the top eight in the standings at the end of the regular season are guaranteed a place at the O2 Arena next month, with Murray currently trailing eighth-placed Milos Raonic by 175 points.

Andy Murray (GBR) - 3,565 . 10. David Ferrer (ESP) - 3,535 . 11. Grigor Dimitrov (BUL) - 3,405 . Murray said: 'My schedule was going to be dictated more how I felt and what I wanted from the end of the year rather than just trying to play to get into the Tour Finals, because I don't think that's necessarily the right way to go about it. 'But the reason I came here (to China) was to try to get some momentum, try to win some more matches, get into the latter stages, play against the best players, and get used to playing at that level consistently again between now and the end of the year. 'But if I play well, I'll give myself a chance at getting to the O2. When I step on the court, that really shouldn't be something I'm thinking about.' Murray speaks to the media at a press conference following his Beijing semi-final defeat on Saturday . Murray and his rivals will have a number of further chances to ensure qualification, culminating in the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris at the end of this month. Despite his shock first round loss to Tatsuma Ito in Tokyo last week, Stan Wawrinka remains best-placed to join the big three in London while US Open finalist Kei Nishikori is also in a strong position after winning successive titles in Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo.

"Steven Naismith has warned Georgia to expect a Scotland onslaught at Ibrox on Saturday. The Everton attacker is certain to start the Euro 2016 qualifier as Gordon Strachan’s side seek their first points in Group D after last month’s narrow defeat by world champions Germany. And Naismith is expected to play off Sunderland’s on-form Steven Fletcher as the Scots seek to kick-start their qualifying campaign ahead of the trip to Poland next week.

Gibraltar (A) - 11/10/15 . ‘I think we will be more positive,’ said Naismith. ‘We will be more attacking than we were in Germany. We will need to be. ‘We are probably more favourites to win the game and there are players on form. ‘Fletch (Steven Fletcher) has done very well in getting goals. He’s a quality player. It’s probably the first time he’s had a run without injuries. We should be going on to create a lot of chances and be more attacking so it will be different, whether or not I’m playing, Fletch is playing or we’re both playing. ‘We’ve also got other guys. Shaun Maloney, who never played against Germany, will be looking to play. Even Moz (James Morrison) has played further forward. With Darren Fletcher and Scott Brown in the middle, that might bring him into contention for that. ‘Even Stevie May. People are still debating whether he is good enough or not, but what he has shown this week has been brilliant. He’s someone I have been really impressed with. It might come too quickly for him to get in this one, but he will be competing for places soon enough.’ Naismith, meanwhile, said he is relishing his first game at Ibrox since his acrimonious departure from Rangers. Naismith will head back to Ibrox for the first time since joining Everton from Rangers in 2012 . The 28-year-old was one of a raft of players who refused to transfer his contract to Charles Green’s newco in 2012, quitting for Everton soon after. Reluctant to return to the stadium since, Naismith said: ‘It should be good. It’s the first time I’ve been back since I left Rangers. I have some fantastic memories from there, not only of playing with Rangers, but when I was with Kilmarnock as well. Hopefully, it can be another good memory. ‘This game and next month’s against Ireland are circumstances that don’t come around much. ‘Although Hampden’s fantastic, you play the majority of your home games there so it’s nice to get a wee change. Going back to Ibrox will be good. ‘When I left to go to Rangers from Kilmarnock, it was a while before I went back to Rugby Park. It’s not that big a deal. I’ve never really thought: “It’s been a while.”’","Scotland target first win in their Euro 2016 qualifying group .

"Furious protesters clashed with police in Madrid yesterday in a huge anti-austerity demonstration. Tens of thousands of people were seen on the streets of the Spanish capital, in a protest against government cuts, and high unemployment. Six riot officers were injured as activists hurled bottles, bricks and fireworks and beat authorities back with batons, according to a police statement.

One . police vehicle and a bank were damaged. It wasn't . immediately clear how many protesters were injured, and if anybody was . seriously hurt on either side. The activists say Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government has eroded Spain's much-valued public health and education systems, while saddling Spaniards with sky-high unemployment and more debt. Six columns of protesters - each from a different region of Spain - arrived at the outskirts of the city early Saturday before heading for Colon square, carrying banners bearing the slogan 'Marching for Dignity.' Activists attacked police officers with batons, though it was not immediately clear if anyone was hurt . Police charged protesters who retaliated, throwing fireworks, bricks and bottles at officers . In the scuffle a police van was damaged and a bank had its front windows smashed in . By late afternoon, Madrid's principal boulevard, Paseo del Prado, was packed with people.

Michael Nadeau, a 44-year-old entrepreneur, added: 'I'm here to fight for my children's future.'For those who are in power we're just numbers. They value money more than they value people.' Rajoy's majority conservative government has pushed several waves of tough tax hikes and cuts through parliament in an attempt to reduce the country's deficit. Spain's recession was triggered five years ago when a housing bubble burst causing a £30billion bailout of the country's banks and massive job losses across the country . Since then the country has been plagued with one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe . Even as the nation emerged from its recession in 2013, the unemployment rate has remained at 26 per cent . A housing bubble burst more than five . years ago, forcing a 41-billion euro ($56 billion) bailout of the . country's banks, squeezing homeowners and throwing millions out of work.

Spain tentatively exited a recession in the . second half of 2013 but unemployment soared with a labour reform which . reduced the cost of hiring and firing.

"Eric Erron Johnson, 29, from west London, was jailed for nine years in August 2008 for manslaughter . A drug-dealing killer who was jailed for nine years for manslaughter has been told he can’t be deported because he is an illegitimate child. Eric Erron Johnson, 29, who was convicted of manslaughter in 2008 after killing a man by hitting him with a piece of wood and stabbing him, was born to a British citizen and a Jamaican woman out of wedlock. He was facing deportation to Jamaica after being jailed but a High Court judge has now ruled there has been a violation of his human rights. Because he was illegitimate he was not entitled automatically to become a British citizen on birth, and then did not apply before he was 18. Mr Justice Dingemans, sitting in London, said it would be open to an immigration tribunal to conclude that Johnson cannot be deported because he has ‘unjustifiably’ suffered discrimination as an illegitimate child, in violation of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects against discrimination, and Article 8 (right to private and family life). The judge quashed a Home Office decision to certify Johnson's human rights claim was ‘clearly unfounded’ and said there must be further consideration of his case. He said that, under . human rights laws, ‘it is not permissible to treat children born out of . wedlock as having no links with their parents' and said in this case 'paternity . is established.’ It means Johnson, from west London, has the option to appeal to an immigration tribunal against the Home Office refusal to revoke the deportation order. The judge described how Johnson’s London-born father went to Jamaica and had a relationship with his natural mother, but they did not marry. Johnson was registered as a Jamaican national and at the age of four he came to the UK with his father and lived with his father's new wife and his half-brothers. In March 1992 he was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK and has lived in the country ever since. At the age of nine he visited his natural mother in Jamaica, but that was the last contact he had with her. Neither he nor his father made an application for him to acquire British citizenship before he was 18, although it would probably have been granted under the then existing rules. Mr Justice Dingemans (above), sitting in London, ruled there has been a violation of Johnson's human rights . The judge said Johnson now had ‘a very serious criminal record’ with offences committed over a five-year period since he became 18 in 2003. The judge described him as ‘a supplier of class A drugs for commercial gain’ and told how he was convicted of manslaughter in August 2008 after a trial in which he falsely claimed to have acted in self-defence. The Home Office immigration authorities began moves to deport him in March 2011 on the grounds that he was ‘a foreign national’ whose removal would be ‘conducive to the public good’.","Eric Erron Johnson was jailed in 2008 after being convicted of manslaughter .

"A Christian teacher and pastor who decided to give up God as part of a 12-month experiment to explore atheism has lost two teaching jobs in the past week and is now struggling to support his two daughters. Ryan Bell, 42, has seen drastic consequences from his 'intellectual experiment' which began on January 1. He was been fired from two Christian schools near his Los Angeles home and is now worried how he will take care of his young daughters, aged 10 and 13. Scroll down for video . Christian teacher Ryan Bell has been fired from two California schools after announcing he would live as an atheist for one year as an experiment . Mr Bell decided to conduct the experiment, where he will address his doubts about the Bible and his faith, after he was ordered to step down as a pastor at the Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Hollywood last year. He plans to not attend church or pray as part of abstaining from his Christian faith. The 42-year-old said that his liberal . views, including campaigning against the same-sex marriage ban for gay . and lesbians, did not go down well with the church. He said: 'It’s like when you go to a movie and you suspend disbelief for three hours to get inside the story. I’m suspending my belief in God to see what atheism is all about.' He told CNN: 'There have been times, usually late at . night and early in the morning, when I think: What have I done? It . really undermines the whole structure of your life, your career, your . family.' Watch the full interview at Ardent Atheist . Mr Bell has decided to step outside his Christian faith for a year and explore atheism . Mr Bell has set up a blog 'Year Without God - a former pastor's journey into atheism' which attaches to a PayPal account where supporters can donate. An atheist blogger has set up an online . fundraiser for the out-of-work, father-of-two. In one day, around 900 . people donated $19,000 to help Mr Bell. As part of his experiment into atheism, Mr Bell intends to attend gatherings of non-believers and read the works of religious skeptics such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Richard Dawkins. Instead of praying for the sick, for example, he intends to do something practical to support them instead.","Ryan Bell, 42, has seen drastic consequences from his 'intellectual experiment' which began on January 1 .

"CLICK HERE to see Harry Redknapp's Premier League team from the early era. For five decades, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful characters. In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' – serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager picks his two all-time greatest Premier League teams from the early years to the present day. From John Terry to Cristiano Ronaldo, the 67-year-old reveals his one to 11 titans of the modern era. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Scholes talk about moment  Schweinsteiger wanted his shirt . Sportsmail can exclusively reveal Harry Redknapp's greatest Premier League XI from the modern era . Steven Gerrard: Stop picking on him . A Roy of the Rovers character. It’s surprising to me how often people have used this tag as a criticism of Steven Gerrard and his all-action playing style. He wants to be everywhere...he deserts his position...he can’t play in the middle because he’ll leave a gap. What nonsense. Roy Race was a comic book hero and Steven Gerrard is a real-life one. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has been selected in Redknapp's Premier League modern era XI . Gerrard's (right) all action approach in midfield has made him a Liverpool and Premier League legend . Paul Scholes: Little ginger nut was a star . Scholes was playing tiki-taka football when nobody in England knew what it was. He was another of those players, like Denis Law or Bobby Moore, who at 15 probably looked as if he wouldn’t make it. Too small, you would think - can’t run, dumpy little ginger nut - but then the ball would come to him and he would dazzle you. He was the best footballer in that Manchester United midfield, better than Ryan Giggs and Roy Keane. Gerrard is joined by Manchester United great Paul Scholes in Redknapp's midfield .

Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . Luis Suarez: How I missed out on signing him at Tottenham . Despite all that has happened in his career since, one of the biggest regrets of my life in management is not taking Luis Suarez to Tottenham when we had the chance. ‘You’ve got to take him, Harry,’ Ruud Gullit told me. ‘He’s fantastic.’ Yet all of our scouts’ reports said that at Ajax he played wide off a striker, whereas we were looking for a proper front man. Just when I was on the verge of taking the plunge, the price went up. In the end he was sold for £22.8million to Liverpool. We wouldn’t have paid that. Luis Suarez scored 31 Premier League goals in a stellar personal season at Liverpool last term . Redknapp reveals he had the opportunity to sign Suarez for Tottenham while he was at Dutch side Ajax . Suarez (centre) joined Liverpool for £22.8million in January 2011 from Ajax . Rio Ferdinand: My Rolls-Royce . There is no way I can leave Rio Ferdinand out of this team because I tipped him at 16 to be the greatest centre-half in Europe and I think, for a time, that is exactly what he was. Nemanja Vidic was a tank, but Rio is the Rolls-Royce. Redknapp has included current QPR defender Rio Ferdinand in his team at centre-back .

"Roy Hodgson made a mistake by revealing Raheem Sterling told him he was feeling tired ahead of England’s game against Estonia, according to former England and Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy. Sterling has come under fire after he was left on the bench for England’s Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia. The 19-year-old was replaced by Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana in the staring XI, but he came on in the second half and played his part in England’s winning goal by winning the free kick from which Wayne Rooney scored. Raheem Sterling told England boss Roy Hodgson he was feeling tired ahead of the Estonia game . Sterling spent the first half of the game on the bench before coming on during the second half . But Murphy believes Hodgson would have been better to keep the conversation between him and Sterling to himself. 'I think Roy will regret putting it out there,’ Murphy said on talkSPORT. 'I think he [Hodgson] could have just maybe taken it on the chin and said, ‘I thought I’d give him a little breather', rather than put it on the lad. 'He wouldn’t have intentionally put it on him to create this, but I think Roy could have dealt with it differently. Sterling played his part in England's win as he won the free kick that Wayne Rooney scored from . Danny Murphy won nine caps for England and worked with Hodgson during his time at Fulham . 'I'm very surprised and if Roy could turn back the clock, I don't think he would do it and say it the way he did because he has caused Raheem a problem and he wouldn't want to do that.' And Murphy, who won nine caps for England, does not believe that Sterling deserves to be criticised for admitting he was tired. He added: ‘The way he plays, with that power and that speed, he gives everything and he needs to be on top of his game,” he continued. 'If he is genuinely tired and he was honest for the team, then fair play to him. ‘Let's not make it a great deal.

The robo-cheetah can 'bound' like a real animal . Speed and agility are hallmarks of the cheetah. The predator is the fastest land animal on Earth, able to accelerate to 60 mph in just a few seconds. As it ramps up to top speed, a cheetah pumps its legs in tandem, bounding until it reaches a full gallop, the MIT team say - and now their robo-cheetah can do the same . The MIT team have built a sleek, four-legged assemblage of gears, batteries, and electric motors that weighs about as much as its feline counterpart. The team recently took the robot for a test run on MIT's Killian Court to show it can run on rough terrain. In experiments on an indoor track, the robot sprinted up to 10 mph, even continuing to run after clearing a hurdle. The MIT researchers estimate that the current version of the robot may eventually reach speeds of up to 30 mph. The key to the bounding algorithm is in programming each of the robot's legs to exert a certain amount of force in the split second during which it hits the ground, in order to maintain a given speed: In general, the faster the desired speed, the more force must be applied to propel the robot forward. Sangbae Kim, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, hypothesizes that this force-control approach to robotic running is similar, in principle, to the way world-class sprinters race. 'Many sprinters, like Usain Bolt, don't cycle their legs really fast,' Kim says. The team have even given their robo-cheetah the markings of its animal counterpart . 'They actually increase their stride length by pushing downward harder and increasing their ground force, so they can fly more while keeping the same frequency.' Kim says that by adapting a force-based approach, the cheetah-bot is able to handle rougher terrain, such as bounding across a grassy field. In treadmill experiments, the team found that the robot handled slight bumps in its path, maintaining its speed even as it ran over a foam obstacle. 'Most robots are sluggish and heavy, and thus they cannot control force in high-speed situations,' Kim says. 'That's what makes the MIT cheetah so special: You can actually control the force profile for a very short period of time, followed by a hefty impact with the ground, which makes it more stable, agile, and dynamic.' Kim says what makes the robot so dynamic is a custom-designed, high-torque-density electric motor, designed by Jeffrey Lang, the Vitesse Professor of Electrical Engineering at MIT. These motors are controlled by amplifiers designed by David Otten, a principal research engineer in MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics. The combination of such special electric motors and custom-designed, bio-inspired legs allow force control on the ground without relying on delicate force sensors on the feet. Kim and his colleagues — research scientist Hae-Won Park and graduate student Meng Yee Chuah — will present details of the bounding algorithm this month at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems in Chicago. The team say the act of running can be parsed into a number of biomechanically distinct gaits, from trotting and cantering to more dynamic bounding and galloping. In bounding, an animal's front legs hit the ground together, followed by its hind legs, similar to the way that rabbits hop — a relatively simple gait that the researchers chose to model first. 'Bounding is like an entry-level high-speed gait, and galloping is the ultimate gait,' Kim says. 'Once you get bounding, you can easily split the two legs and get galloping.' As an animal bounds, its legs touch the ground for a fraction of a second before cycling through the air again. The percentage of time a leg spends on the ground rather than in the air is referred to in biomechanics as a 'duty cycle'; the faster an animal runs, the shorter its duty cycle. Kim and his colleagues developed an algorithm that determines the amount of force a leg should exert in the short period of each cycle that it spends on the ground. That force, they reasoned, should be enough for the robot to push up against the downward force of gravity, in order to maintain forward momentum. 'Once I know how long my leg is on the ground and how long my body is in the air, I know how much force I need to apply to compensate for the gravitational force,' Kim says. 'Now we're able to control bounding at many speeds. 'And to jump, we can, say, triple the force, and it jumps over obstacles.' In experiments, the team ran the robot at progressively smaller duty cycles, finding that, following the algorithm's force prescriptions, the robot was able to run at higher speeds without falling. The team with their robo-cheetah at MIT . Kim says the team's algorithm enables precise control over the forces a robot can exert while running. By contrast, he says, similar quadruped robots may exert high force, but with poor efficiency. What's more, such robots run on gasoline and are powered by a gasoline engine, in order to generate high forces. 'As a result, they're way louder,' Kim says. 'Our robot can be silent and as efficient as animals. 'The only things you hear are the feet hitting the ground. 'This is kind of a new paradigm where we're controlling force in a highly dynamic situation. 'Any legged robot should be able to do this in the future.'","MIT has created algorithm to allow robot to 'bound' like a real cheetah .

"Homes in Britain are becoming the smallest in Europe with new one-bed flats now typically no bigger than a Tube carriage. Faced with rising land costs, developers are cramming a lounge, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom into as little as 495 square feet. The result is ‘cramped, dark and artificially lit’ environments that put health and wellbeing at risk, the Royal Institute of Architects said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stark: Britons are living in the smallest homes in Western Europe and it is making us ill and unhappy, RIBA says . How we live: RIBA say the average UK one-bed flat (left), equates to living in a London Tube carriage (right) It warned the lack of space and light . could cause marital problems and even stop children from reaching their . full potential at school. The average new UK home has shrunk to . 818 square feet, 10 per cent smaller than 30 years ago, making our . properties the tiniest in Western Europe. Campaign: Kevin McCloud, presenter of Channel 4 show Grand Designs,  is leading a campaign to ensure people live in bigger, lighter homes, and took to a Tube train to make his point . Riba’s Case for Space report says . homebuyers are increasingly concerned that new homes are not big enough . for their needs. ‘Research suggests consumers are right to be worried,’ the report says. ‘A lack of space has been shown to . impact on the basic lifestyle needs that many people take for granted, . such as having enough space to store possessions or even to entertain . friends. ‘In more extreme cases, lack of . adequate space for a household has also been shown to have significant . impacts on health, educational attainment and family relationships.’ Research shows a lack of natural . light – often due to small windows – can lead to a diminished immune . system, diabetes and premature ageing. Natural light can decrease the risk of . insomnia, depression and obesity, while over-exposure to the artificial . variety can disrupt sleeping patterns. The abolition of the minimum space standards through the 1980 Local Government, Planning and Land Act is to blame, Riba says. Properties in Ireland are 15 per cent . bigger, in the Netherlands they are 53 per cent bigger and those in . Denmark – at 1,475 square feet – are a staggering 80 per cent more . expansive. For those living in a home between two and ten years old a lack of space is the main reason for wanting to move out. Riba has launched a campaign called . HomeWise, headed by Kevin McCloud of Channel 4’s Grand Designs, to call . for minimum size and light standards for all homes. Message: RIBA's report spells out what it believes can happen to those living in less light than they should . Research: Space at home is shrinking, according to the research, and many are living in the same area as a Tube train . Posters: RIBA are hoping their posters will go viral and encourage people to  join their campaign . ‘This isn’t rocket science. We all . instinctively respond to the opportunity for a view, a connection with . the outdoors, fresh air, light and space,’ Mr McCloud said. ‘A return to minimum space standards . is crucial for the health and wellbeing of the people who will be living . in new build homes.’ The presenter blamed the Town and Country Planning Act for the shrinking size of homes. ‘It effectively rationed the distribution of land for development by producing the green belt,’ he added. ‘That meant land started to be traded as a commodity and increased in value.’ A Jubilee Line train carriage covers 495 square feet, Riba said.

"There have been 3D-printed buildings, dresses, hats, jewellery and even parts of the anatomy. And now the world has been introduced to Strati, a 3D-printed car which was created using direct digital manufacturing techniques. The car is composed of 40 parts - a significantly smaller number than that of a conventional vehicle which has more than 20,000 components. The Strati is made of only 40 parts, unlike conventional vehicles which have more than 20,000 components . Conceived of by the Arizona-based Local Motors, the printing and assembly process took 44 hours to complete and took place during the six-day International Manufacturing Technology Show 2014 in Chicago. Made of one solid piece, the Strati will have a top speed of 40mph and a battery range of between 120 to 150 miles. The chassis and the body of the car are printed using a giant 3D printer but the tires, seats, wheels, battery, wiring, suspension, electric motor and window shield were made using conventional methods. Local Motors hopes to offer 3D-printed cars for sale for between £11,000 to £18,000 ($18k to $30k) each . The car was made using a giant 3D printer which can process parts as large as 3ft by 5ft by 10ft . The battery-powered, two-passenger car is made of layers of black plastic and reinforced with carbon fiber. Local Motors CEO John Rogers told the Wall Street Journal: 'We are the first company to make a 3D-printed car using carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic. 'The seats, body, chassis, dash, center console and hood will all be 3D printed.' Experts hope the less expensive manufacturing process will bring innovations to the market more swiftly . The company hopes to offer 3D-printed cars for between £11,000 to £18,000 ($18,000 to $30,000) each, depending on the types of optional features buyers will want. A machine tool maker, Cincinnati Inc, supplied the huge printer, much larger than the usual 3D printers, which are usually 10ins by 10ins. This particular printer is able to process parts as large as 3ft by 5ft by 10ft. Local Motors wants to launch '3D printed vehicles that will be available to the general public' Local Motors has been producing motorcycles, motorised skateboards and other vehicles since 2007, using the same method. Mr Rogers hopes that this less expensive manufacturing process will bring innovations to the market more swiftly than the usual methods of production. On their website, Local Motors says that it is planning to launch 'production-level 3D printed vehicles that will be available to the general public for purchase in the months following the show'.","Strati was conceived of by Arizona-based innovators Local Motors .

"Tyler Blackett is keen on becoming Manchester United's first choice free-kick taker, but appreciates he may have to prove he's better than 'amazing' Angel Di Maria. The 20-year-old defender, drafted in by new manager Louis van Gaal this season, does pack a punch from set-pieces and has scored them for United's youth teams including a rocket against Swansea. And he's been picking up tips from the Argentina star on the training field and hopes to get a chance to take one soon. Tyler Blackett is hoping to have the opportunity to take free-kicks for Manchester United . Blackett described £60m signing Angel Di Maria as 'amazing' - he has three goals and three assists so far . In an interview with BBC Match of the Day Magazine, Blackett said: 'Hopefully further on into the season, you'll get to see me take one. 'I'd certainly be happy to if the opportunity came up. For now though, Angel's the expert so I'm just looking up to him.' The young defender has certainly been impressed by the impact the £60m signing has had at Old Trafford, scoring three goals - including a direct free-kick against QPR - and contributing three assists in five appearances. United manager Louis van Gaal has put his faith in young players like Blackett this season . Tyler Blackett taking the attack to Everton during his late appearance in Sunday's 2-1 win at Old Trafford . 'He's been amazing. He's one of the world's best players and the things that he does in training really make us stop and stare. 'The dribbling, the close control, these are things that a lot of players would like to have, but that not everybody's got! 'He really is special!' Blackett has made six appearances for United this season and is likely to enjoy more as fellow centre backs Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling struggle for fitness. The lifelong United fan, who used to try to emulate Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Rio Ferdinand on the playground, admits it's all been a little surreal this season. He said: 'It's still something that feels a bit unreal. I love being inside Old Trafford, putting my boots on and taking in the atmosphere.

"Microsoft will acquire the maker of the popular game Minecraft for $2.5 billion. The technology company said it will buy Stockholm-based game maker Mojang. Minecraft, which lets users build in and explore a virtual world, has been downloaded 100 million times on PC alone since its launch in 2009. It is the most popular online game on Xbox, and the top paid app for Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating system in the U.S. Move for mobile? Microsoft will acquire the maker of the popular game Minecraft for $2.5 billion in a move many insiders say is engineered to increase the tech giant's share in the mobile market . The deal is expected to close in late 2014. Microsoft expects the acquisition to be break-even in fiscal 2015. Microsoft is primarily known for business software like Word and Outlook. But this acquisition will help Microsoft expand its gaming division which also includes game franchises such as the 'Halo' shooter game and 'Forza' racing game. However, many contend that Microsoft's impending purchase of Mojang, is more aimed at pulling users onto the software company's obscure mobile platform than its better known PC system or Xbox game console. The software company's Windows Phone system has only 2.5 percent of the world's smartphone market, and its Surface tablet barely more, according to tech research firm IDC. Growth is hampered because many app and game developers ignore it. Enter Minecraft, which is the top paid app both on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS and Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android systems. 'It seems like Microsoft is looking at Mojang and Minecraft as a way to tap into this enormous cultural phenomenon,' said Dave Bisceglia, Chief Executive of independent game studio Tap Lab. 'If you look at iOS, Minecraft has been a top-grossing game for quite some time, if Microsoft could on Windows phones give players a unique and compelling experience that you can't get on the other platforms, that could be a driver to sell devices to existing Minecraft fans.' Microsoft does not disclose numbers of users of Windows Phones, and declined comment on the deal. Minecraft was launched five years ago as a PC game, but 54 million sales later, about 40 percent of copies are downloaded onto phones and tablets. Left to their own devices, it does not seem likely that Mojang's 40-strong team would ever get round to designing a Windows Phone version of Minecraft. Markus Persson, the game's creator and co-founder of Mojang, said last year that Windows phones are so insignificant in terms of market share that they are not worth developing for. Wildly popular: Minecraft, which lets users build in and explore a virtual world, has been downloaded 100 million times on PC alone since its launch in 2009 . 'Because it's tiny,' Persson wrote in an email to Reuters last June, when asked why his company only made mobile versions of its games for iOS and Android, but not Windows Phone. 'Both Symbian and Blackberry have more users than Windows Phone,' wrote Persson, referring to Nokia's discontinued operating system and the fading Canadian smartphone pioneer. Wall Street is focused on the mobile benefits for Microsoft. 'We don't view this acquisition as a signal of Microsoft's intent to double down on Xbox but consider it an attempt to better address mobile on a cross-platform basis,' said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund in a note to clients this week. 'This also appears to be consistent with (Microsoft) CEO Satya Nadella's mobile and cloud strategy.' Microsoft is expected to pay close to $2.5 billion for Mojang, or about 8 times sales last year. That is small change for Microsoft, which has $86 billion in cash and short-term investments. But it is relatively large and expensive for game company acquisitions, which do not have a stellar record of success. Japan's SoftBank Corp (9984.T) paid $1.53 billion for a 50 percent stake in Finnish game maker Supercell last year at about 3.5 times projected annual sales. Electronic Arts' (EA.O) $750 million acquisition of PopCap in 2011 was valued around 10 to 11 times sales. Joost van Dreunen, Chief Executive of research firm SuperData, said the price tag 'seems like a lot for a title that has certainly not peaked but is certainly not in its initial frenzy.' He doubts that Minecraft can really help Windows phone sales: 'Minecraft itself has done very well on the iOS platform, but it's better on the iPad, the screen is bigger,' he said. 'I don't see why this could drive handset sales.'","Minecraft, which lets users build in and explore a virtual world, has been downloaded 100 million times on PC alone since its launch in 2009 .

"A lonely-heart shepherdess who launched a quest to find love has revealed she was almost left paralysed - after breaking her back in a freak quad bike crash. Emma Gray, 26, who single-handedly runs a 150-acre farm, sparked a stampede for her affections after looking for a boyfriend to help manage her land. But her quest suffered a set back when her quad bike flipped from under her, near her estate in the Scottish Highlands. She landed on her back and crushed her vertebrae - leaving her in serious danger of being paralysed. Emma Gray, who lives a solitary life up on a hill-top farm, was lucky that her sister was nearby when she had the accident. She is pictured, left, at Borders General Hospital . However, she is now battling back to full health and is determined not to let the accident prevent her quest to find love. She said: 'The crash was the worst experience of my life but I am determined to carry on. 'I was gathering sheep at my mum and dad’s farm and driving up the side of a quarry on some shingle when the whole bike began to slide. 'The bike rolled right on top of me. I was in hospital unable to move for a week which was very frustrating. I couldn’t do anything. 'I never want to go through anything like that again.' Emma, from Hawick, in the Scottish Borders, was out working the land at her parent’s farm just a few miles from her own - when the quad bike went out of control. Luckily her sister Caroline, 23, was close by and raised the alarm following the crash, over the Jubilee weekend in June. Paramedics rushed her to hospital where she lay unable to move for a week with a back brace. She was then fitted with a chest cast and discharged a week later. Emma Gray, pictured with some of her flock, is eager to get back into the dating game . She said: 'I remember just before the crash thinking ‘this is going to hurt’ just before the bike hit me. 'My main concern was the dogs, which were on the back, but they jumped off and the bike only hit me. 'I was laid on my back totally unable to move for 20 minutes, I could get the air into my lungs. 'At first I thought I was just winded so after a while I got up and got back on the bike, which had rolled to the bottom of the hill and landed back on its wheels again. 'By the time I got back to the house I couldn’t move for the pain and my sister called an ambulance. 'They realised it was an unstable fracture and I could have done serious damage. I couldn’t believe it when I saw the x-rays. 'I’ve very independent so having to use a bed pan and not been able to do anything was hard for me. 'My back’s never going to be completely right. But I was so lucky I didn’t do it on my own farm where I would have been alone. I’m great now, just still frustrated at all the things I still can’t do.' Emma Gray's spine after her quad bike accident . Emma had the cast off two weeks ago and is now on the road to recovery. She even managed to win a sheepdog trial on Saturday. She said: 'I had the cast off two weeks ago. I’m getting back on my feet and winning my first sheep dog trials since the crash has been the icing on the cake.' Emma grew up on her parents’ farm near Hawick, in the Borders, and has been a dab hand around the farm since she was a child. She went on to study sheep management . at college and at the age of 23, after a heartbreaking split from her . fiance, successfully convinced the National Trust to give her the sole . tenancy of a hill farm. The property has no mains electricity or gas supplies and a windmill-powered hot water system.But Emma, who has represented England in the International Sheepdog trials, has run the farm successfully ever since. Earlier this year she penned an autobiography called ‘One Girl and Her Dog’ - sparking a rush for her affections. Emma . admits her isolation has left her out of the dating loop, which her . only managing to travel to the nearby town of Morpeth a couple of times a . month. But she is convinced Mr Right is out there somewhere. She . said: 'I have been on a couple of dates in the last few months but . since my accident I haven’t been able to go out so things have ground to . a halt.

Accosta, by whom he has daughters Katherine, 18, Jessica, 17, and . Matilda, 14, Wyman said of his love affair with a schoolgirl: ‘It was . very emotional and special at the time. It wasn’t how it was reported to . be and it was the only time it ever  happened in my life. ‘A lot of people understood, but a lot didn’t, and the media certainly didn’t. They treated me like c**p.’ Child bride: Mandy Smith today. She is no longer in contact with the former Rolling Stone . Ageing rock star: Bill Wyman was reunited with the Stones to mark 50 years of the band . Admitting he avoided talking about . Miss Smith because it upset his wife and teenage girls – ‘who are the . age she was’ – Wyman said: ‘We all have a skeleton in the cupboard, it’s . just if you’re a taxi driver in  Halifax no one ever hears about it. ‘But if you are a celebrity  everyone . does. In my case it was publicised to the world and that wasn’t really . fair, I don’t think.’ He said: ‘I went to the police and I . went to the public prosecutor and said, “Do you want to talk to me? Do . you want to meet up with me, or anything like that?” and I got a message . back, “No”. ‘I was totally open about it.’ The Metropolitan Police refused to comment on Wyman’s claims. The star, who married first wife Diane . in 1959, went through his first divorce in 1969 after joining the . Rolling Stones plunged him into a world of groupies, from whom he . reportedly picked favourites while playing bass on stage. He has boasted of bedding a thousand . young women, and first met 13-year-old Mandy Smith when she was dancing . at London’s Lyceum ballroom with her elder sister. He has said she made him feel as if he . had been ‘whacked over the head with a hammer’, and he promptly began . helping her find work as a model.

"Spain has been forced to make an embarrassing apology to the King of Morocco after police officers mistook the royal for a drug smuggler before attempting to board his yacht. King Mohammed VI had been enjoying a day sailing in the waters off Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta when a Spanish civil guard patrol boat began speeding towards his entourage. Officers approached two speed boats and three jetskis belonging to the king's party and demanded to know the identities and destination of those on board. Scroll down for video . Incensed: King Mohammed VI of Morocco was furious with Spanish civil guard officers after they mistook his boat for a drug-smuggling vessel in waters off Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta . The incensed monarch is said to have shouted: 'Do you know who I am?', Spanish daily newspaper El Mundo reports. When the officers said they did not -  he removed his cap and sunglasses and was instantly recognised by the sheepish patrol crew. An infuriated King Mohammed then immediately phoned King Felipe VI of Spain to complain about the incident, the Telegraph reports. An urgent message was sent from the Royal Household to Spain's interior ministry and Colonel Andres Lopez, the head of the Civil Guard in Ceuta, was immediately dispatched to the Moroccan royal yacht so that he could personally apologise. Embarrassing: King Felipe VI of Spain (left) is said to have organised an urgent apology after receiving a call from the outraged King of Morocco (right) on August 7 . Hot water: Spain were forced to make a speedy apology to the Moroccan king following the embarrassing actions of the Spanish civil guard near Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta (above) While King Mohammed recognised that Spanish officers were 'only doing their job' he also stated 'the police did not show me respect'. Spain's Royal Palace insisted King Felipe maintains a 'very good relationship with Mohammed VI'. King Felipe and Queen Letizia visited the Moroccan king last month in one of their first official trips abroad since the abdication of King Juan Carlos. The attempt to search the royal yacht on August 7 came days before a huge influx of migrants landed on Spanish shores after crossing the Strait of Gibraltar from the Moroccan coast. Drug trafficking gangs routinely use speed boats and jetskis to transport illegal substances across the strait. Despite being part of Spain, Ceuta is an autonomous city located on the coast of North Africa. It has been a European territory for more than 500 years, and Madrid insists it will not relinquish control of the city. The majority of the city's population are ethnic Spanish and opposed to the idea of being ruled by Morocco. It is just 12.5 miles from the Spanish coast and has an area of seven square miles. On 5 November 2007, King Juan Carlos I of Spain visited the city, sparking protests from the Moroccan government. It was the first time a Spanish head of state had visited Ceuta in 80 years.","King Mohammed VI was sailing off Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta .

"A large prehistoric building older than Egypt’s pyramids has been discovered in Wales. The foundations of a meeting house which was at least 50ft long were uncovered as builders worked on a new housing estate in Monmouth. Archaeologists are mystified by the 'unique' find and say that nothing like it has ever been found in Britain. Unique find: The foundations of a meeting house which could be 6,500 years old were uncovered as builders worked on a new housing estate in Monmouth, south Wales . After studying the foundations, made up of 3ft-wide tree trunks, experts believe the building was a long house constructed on the edge of a long-lost lake which has silted up over time. Monmouth Archaeology has dated the find to at least the Bronze Age - but it could be early Neolithic about 6,500 years ago. The pyramids in Egypt were built about 4,500 years ago. Archaeologist Steve Clarke said: 'We’re not really sure what it is. It’s a mystery, but it’s the foundation for something. We haven’t seen anything like it. 'We think it’s a long house which would have been home to a family, and perhaps used for gatherings and meetings.' He added: 'We think it could be from the Bronze Age but some of the experts we’ve brought in to see it think it could be early Neolithic. 'If that’s the case it could easily pre-date the pyramids.' Expert believe the building was a long house constructed on the edge of a long-lost lake which has silted up . The building’s foundations were made from entire tree trunks, measuring about a metre wide. The wooden foundations were at least 50ft long. Mr Clarke said most of the known long houses were built on posts about a 1ft wide, but trees had been used for the base of the Monmouth structure. The find is on the Parc Glyndwr development in Monmouth, where about 80 houses are to be built. Monmouth Archaeology was employed by the housing developers to study the site. Archaeologists have ordered radio-carbon tests of the foundations and the results are expected later this month.","Foundations of meeting house at least 50ft long found in Monmouth .

"Wasps fans have been told to accept the reality of professional sport following the watershed purchase of Coventry’s Ricoh Arena in a move which paves the way for NFL-style franchises in rugby union. The two-time European champions, who came close to going bankrupt two years ago, on Wednesday confirmed they will play their first match at their new ground in December after Coventry City Council agreed to sell them a 50 per cent share in the ground in a deal which could end up being worth almost £19million. The decision to relocate the former north London club from their current High Wycombe home — where they have played home games for the past 12 years — has incensed supporters, and there is also unease among rival clubs in their new territory, including Worcester, Leicester and Northampton. Wasps' James Haskell, Dai Young and Andy Goode during the announcement of a new stadium and sponsor . Coventry City Football Club have only recently returned to the Ricoh Arena after a year away . Some Wasps fans have indicated they intend to protest at Sunday’s Aviva Premiership clash with Bath at Adams Park, and Northampton boss Jim Mallinder sympathised with them on Wednesday. ‘I feel sorry for the loyal, local Wasps fans,’ Mallinder said. ‘If Northampton Saints decided to move there would be a bit of an uproar.’ The move was welcomed by Wasps captain James Haskell, whom Sportsmail understands received a ‘slap on the wrist’ for tweeting a picture of his new Range Rover on Tuesday ahead of the club’s announcement of a new sponsorship deal with the Coventry-based car manufacturers. Young (right) speaks to press during the announcement of Land Rover as the new club sponsors . ‘I know people will be sceptical about change but this club have been just an hour away from bankruptcy in recent years,’ Haskell said. ‘We have losses of £3m a year and there was no other option but to look for a new stadium. ‘I know this will be difficult to explain to a young Wasps fan but Coventry isn’t a million miles away.’ Doubts remain over contractual issues facing players who signed deals to play in London but prop Matt Mullan insisted: ‘As players we’ve put our trust in people at the club that they are making the right decision for the club’.","Wasps came close to going bankrupt two years ago and confirmed on Wednesday that they have agreed a deal to move to the Ricoh Arena .

"A Wall Street Journal columnist made an impassioned attack against New York city's new bike share program, known as Citi Bike.In an online video segment entitled 'Death by Bicycle,' editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz criticized Major Bloomberg for allowing the 'dreadful program' to come to New York.Rabinowitz also attacked cyclists who she said were given carte blanche to ignore the rules of the road in the interest of environmentalist programs. Scroll down for video. Wall Street Journal editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz gave an impassioned attack on Citi Bike, the New York City bike sharing program, criticizing Major Bloomberg and cyclists . When asked by the host of Wall Street Journal Live why she thought the local government would want to implement a program like this, Rabinowitz came out swinging replying, 'Do not ask me to enter the minds of the totalitarians running this government of the city.'She went on to attack Bloomberg for his support of the program and bemoan the damage she felt it had done to the city.'Envision what happens when you get a government that is run by an autocratic major before which you are helpless,' she said. 'We now look at a city who's best neighborhoods are absolutely begrimed by these blazing blue Citibank bikes.'Noting the number of bike stands the went up around the city, the moderator added that the bays are fire hazards for firetrucks who can no longer park close to some subway stations.Rabinowitz continued her rant, blasting cyclists for not obeying traffic laws in the city, citing that they often veer from designated bike lanes on to pedestrian sidewalks. Rabinowitz said that the 'blazing blue' Citi Bikes, seen here, 'begrimed' the city's best neighborhoods . 'The most important danger in this city is not the yellow cabs it is the bicyclists,' she said, 'empowered by the city administration with the idea that they are privileged because they are part of all the good forward looking things.'Despite his critics Bloomberg praised the new green initiative during a Memorial Day parade in Queens.'This is going to be phenomenally popular,' Bloomberg said, according to a report from The Daily News.The first wave of the Citi Bike plan will put 6,000 bikes at 330 docking bays below 59th Street and in downtown Brooklyn. Rabinowitz also vehemently criticized Major Bloomberg and his support of the bike sharing program, calling an 'autocratic major before which [New Yorkers] are helpless' New York City residents can rent bikes around the city for a yearly fee of $95. Daily rental passes are also available for short-term bikers. Rabinowitz failed to be moved by the city's initiative, which in her view is aimed to make people feel like they are living in a European city.'If the major had had any guts he would have undertaken a study, but he knew [the citizens] were against it,' she fired.'I represent the majority of citizens, the majority of citizens of this city are appalled by what happened,' Rabinowitz said.'The fact that a city is helpless before the driven, personal, and ideological passions of its leader in the interest, allegedly, of the good of the city, can take many forms, but we have seen the most dramatic exposition of this in our city ...''With the latest example of this being the bike share program,' the moderator finished.

"A lone Frenchman lost everything when his house boat burst into flames off the North East coast.The man was sailing in his 38ft yacht from Iceland to Holland when an explosion on the boat caused a fire. He managed to raise the alarm with the RNLI who found him floating ten miles off the coast of Seaham, County Durham. This video shows the moment the man's boat was discovered engulfed in a ball of flames by RNLI volunteers from Tynemouth and Hartlepool before it sank. The Hartlepool crews were there in 35 minutes, by which time the vessel was well alight. An RAF helicopter saved the man, who had clambered aboard a life raft, by winching him to safety. Hartlepool RNLI coxswain Robbie Maiden said: 'Fortunately the sailor was uninjured but it was very sad to see his yacht burn and then sink so quickly. 'We understand the boat was his home and he was sailing from Iceland to Holland, but it looks like he's lost nearly everything. RNLI volunteers came to the rescue of a Frenchman whose 38ft yacht burst into flames ten miles off the coast of Seaham, County Durham . An RAF helicopter winched the man to safety but the RNLI volunteers were unable to save his boat, which is believed to be his home, as it was already engulfed in flames . 'He seems to have done all the right things in what must have been a very frightening situation. 'He launched the life raft correctly and had everything he needed to keep safe, including a life jacket, flares and water.

"UK Scouting membership has grown by almost a quarter in the last 10 years - and there are now more than half a million Scouts. The Scout Association said its membership has shot up from 450,455 to 550,457 members in the last decade, and in this time female membership has grown from 69,996 to 128,042. The number of adults volunteering has increased by 14,596 in 10 years to a total of 104,28, but more than 40,000 young people want to join and are unable to because more adult volunteers are required to help, the Association said. Chief Scout Bear Grylls said scouting gives young people the chance of adventure and teaches them positive life skills . The figures are based on findings from the Scout Association's latest census, which is carried out annually to identify trends and development areas in the movement. The Association said it is launching a plan to recruit a further 58,000 young people, as well as 18,000 more adult volunteers by 2018. Over the past 18 months, the movement said it has focused on delivering its youth work in more deprived parts of the UK, using funding supplied by central government via the Youth United Foundation. Scouting has worked hard to change the public's perception of the organisation . This funding has enabled the recruitment of 1,553 more young members and 315 adult volunteers in areas such as Newham, Salford, Burnley and Merseyside. Wayne Bulpitt, UK chief commissioner, said: 'Scouting offers young people and adults alike a chance of real adventure. Scouting changes young people's lives and the communities in which they live for the better. 'We have a clear plan to make the movement more diverse, more community-focused and more youth-led in the next four years. 'Ultimately this means we want to recruit another 18,000 adults by 2018 so that they can help offer life-changing adventures to 58,000 more young people.' Allowing girls join the Scouts has seen membership of the organisation increase by more than 100,000 . Chief Scout Bear Grylls said being a Scout 'empowers' people, and he said he is ""excited"" to see membership increasing. 'I am super-proud to see so many young people and adults learning new life skills, achieving personal rewards through Scouting in the UK. 'I am excited to see Scout numbers continue to rise across the UK and the big reasons for this are that more and more young people are realising that Scouting can give them so much - whether it's the opportunity to be involved with some incredible adventures, learn practical life, outdoor and teamwork skills, or helping to improve their local communities. 'People don't want to miss out and Scouting brings them all together, empowers them and allows them to make a positive impact,' he said.","The Scout Association needs more adult volunteers to admit 40,000 additional young people into the organisation .

"Everton have agreed a new five-year contract with England defender John Stones worth around £30,000 a week. The 20-year-old, who was on the stand-by list for England’s World Cup squad, has been a target for Chelsea, who were willing to offer £15million for the promising centre-back.

It was a very memorable season and hopefully there’s more to come.’ Steven Pienaar has been full of praise for Stones, who he says will be a key cog for England in the coming years. 'Stonesy is totally different compared to other English central defenders. He's more of a ball player who is really comfortable in possession,' Pienaar said. 'It suits the manager and it's good for the team. I can understand why England put their hopes on him. He's certainly got a bright future and he's got a good head on his shoulders.

"A naked man is Tasered without warning as he is strip-searched in a police cell. Daniel Dove, 23, is struck in the chest and collapses to the floor in agony as the stun gun continues to deliver a 50,000-volt shock. CCTV footage of the incident was leaked yesterday after a chief constable refused to publish it despite a judge saying he should. The officer who fired the Taser, PC Lee Birch, 30, was cleared of assault this week but now faces a police inquiry for gross misconduct. He remains on duty. Mr Dove was arrested at 2am on December 23, 2012 on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly after being thrown out of a nightclub in Trowbridge, Wiltshire. This footage shows the moment PC Lee Birch sent Daniel Dove crashing to the floor of the police cell, Tasering the suspect after he threw his underpants in the police officer's face . The 23-year-old was escorted into the cell by three police officers, for a strip search . Mr Dove had been arrested on December 23, 2013 for being drunk and disorderly outside a nightclub in Trowbridge, Wiltshire . He claims police pushed him into a puddle on the ground as they handcuffed him and took him to Melksham police station. The carpenter was put in a cell, where PC Birch – holding his Taser behind his back – began a strip search. Mr Dove said he felt humiliated and flicked his wet boxer shorts at the officer’s face. The CCTV footage shows PC Birch instantly swinging his arm round and firing the Taser. In court, PC Birch admitted his life had not been under threat, but he ‘would not wish to restrain a naked man’ and used the Taser instead. A jury cleared him of assault and misconduct in a public office. Mr Dove was charged with assaulting PC Birch and another officer during his arrest but the case was dropped. He says police chiefs initially ignored his official complaint but PC Birch and four other officers now face a misconduct inquiry. Yesterday, Mr Dove said: ‘I’m hopeful that he’ll be punished for what he did but I’m not too optimistic given that a court didn’t find him guilty.’ During the CCTV recording PC Birch can be seen to unclip his Taser from his holster within seconds of entering the cell. He then continues to conceal it behind his back throughout the strip search before deploying it - holding the trigger for seven seconds. Mr Dove crashes to the ground where PC Birch grabs the boxers and throws them at the wall, before shouting 'you have assaulted me, don't do that again'. During the week-long trial Mr Dove told the court he was compliant throughout his arrest and gave PC Birch no reason to open fire. Feeling 'humilated' as he removed his underpants Mr Dove hurled them in PC Birch's face in a 'split second' fit of temper, he told a court . PC Birch, who responded by drawing his Taser gun from behind his back zapping Mr Dove with the 50,000-volt weapon, was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and misconduct in public office . PC Birch, who held on to the trigger for seven seconds while Mr Dove fell to the floor, was acquitted on both charges by a jury at Bristol Crown Court . Despite a judge ruling the horrifying footage could now be released to the media, Patrick Geenty, Wiltshire's Chief Constable, objected. The video was later leaked to ITV West Country by a concerned member of the public . PC Lee Birch was cleared of the charges against him at Bristol Crown Court this week . He said: 'I was compliant up until a point when I felt like I was being humiliated, I was stripped completely naked and put on my knees with hand cuffs on. 'PC Birch asked me to get naked in a strip search, which I did. 'You feel quite embarrassed, when I took them off it was a split second thing, I did it because I was annoyed.' He added: 'I was not aware he had a Taser, he didn't tell me he had it or that he intended to use it. 'As soon as I flicked my pants at him he pulled his arm up from behind his back and shot me with it. 'He has not pulled it from a holster and said ""I will shoot you"", he has just pulled it from behind his back and shot me. 'I didn't have any time to react or move, by the time I saw it. 'I don't know why he used it, I couldn't exactly move because there were three guys there so for him to use that on me was a bit irrational.' The trial heard how Dove was arrested . in the early hours of December 23, 2012 outside a nightclub in . Trowbridge, Wiltshire after clashing with another man. Bouncers called police when he refused to cooperate and he was detained for being drunk and disorderly. During the arrest he allegedly tried to punch PC Birch and kneed his colleague PC Reed in the groin. Dove was then taken into custody at Melksham where he was escorted to a cell by PC Birch and two other officers to be searched. The . court heard how PC Birch unclipped his Taser from his holster within . seconds of entering the cell with the two others and held it behind his . back throughout. PC Birch is seen grabbing the boxers and throwing them at the wall, before shouting 'you have assaulted me, don't do that again' at Mr Dove . During the week-long trial Mr Dove told the court he was compliant throughout his arrest and gave PC Birch no reason to open fire . PC Birch told the court he was 'not looking for an excuse to use the Taser' and said he believed it was 'reasonable and proportionate and not motivated by anger or malice' The jury saw CCTV footage of Dove, who admitted drinking four pints of Fosters and two Jagerbombs, struggling with PC Birch. PC Birch told the court he was 'not looking for an excuse to use the Taser' and said he believed it was 'reasonable and proportionate and not motivated by anger or malice'. He now faces an internal inquiry and investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. A Taser is an electroshock weapon that uses electrical current to inhibit voluntary control of muscles, causing neuromuscular incapacitation. A person struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscular contractions. They were introduced as non-lethal weapons to be used by police officers to aphrend fleeing, belligerent or potentially dangerous suspects. A Police Executive Research Forum study from 2009 revealed officer injuries drop by 76 per cent when a Taser is used. Critics have argued that Tasers and other high-voltage stun guns can cause cardiac arrhythmia in susceptible suspects, which can lead to heart attack and death in some cases. Those susceptible to the reaction are sometimes healthy and unaware of their susceptibility.","PC Lee Birch was cleared of assault at Bristol Crown Court this week .

"The mixed-race population is among the fastest growing in Britain and is already the largest ethnic group among under-16s. Data from the 2011 census, released tomorrow, will suggest there are now more than one million people born to parents in interracial relationships. But academics believe the true figure could be more than double this, because many of mixed-race are believed to define themselves as a single race on official forms. Mixed race: Olympic heptathlete Jessica Ennis, 26, of Sheffield, is pictured (left with her MBE) with her fiancee Andy Hill in November 2011, while her parents Alison Powell and Vinnie Ennis are seen (right) in August 2009 . It coincides with a poll which suggests prejudices towards mixed-race relationships are waning. Think-tank British Future found just 15 per cent would feel uncomfortable if their child was in an interracial relationship, compared with 40 per cent two decades ago. Among the 18 to 24 category, this fell to 5 per cent, with the younger generation claiming they would be more concerned if their child married someone from a wealthier background. The prominence of mixed-race celebrities has been partly credited with helping to change attitudes. Born to a white British mother and Jamaican father, Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis, 26, was heralded as the unofficial poster girl of the London 2012 Games. When Ennis’s parents Alison and Vinnie met in Derbyshire in the 1980s, the majority of the population were opposed to mixed-race relationships. The survey by British Future ask 2,000 adults to think about their children or grandchildren being in a serious relationship . Champion: The British Future survey also found only 42 per cent of people could correctly identify Jessica Ennis (pictured winning gold in the London 2012 heptathlon in August) as mixed race . Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, said: ‘Jessica Ennis was not just the face of the Olympics this summer; she could stake a fair claim to be the face of the census, too.’ Other mixed-race stars include Britain’s Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon, born to a Jamaican father and white-British mother. The latest census results are expected to rank British Indians as the largest ethnic minority group.Islam will also be identified as the fastest-growing faith, with more than two million Muslims. According to the 2001 census, 677,177 classified themselves as mixed race, equating to 1.2 per cent of the UK population. The 2011 census is expected to show that one million Britons are mixed race, which equates to 1.6 per cent of the population. British Future, which asked more than 2,000 adults to think about their children or grandchildren being in a serious relationship, found that race was largely not an issue. However, the poll found 56 per cent felt uncomfortable about the partner having a criminal record. A third felt uncomfortable about their offspring dating someone of the same sex or someone more than 15 years older or younger. The survey found 87 per cent of people from mixed-race backgrounds were open to mixed-race relationships compared with 60 per cent of whites. Many struggled to identify a mixed-race person with only 42 per cent correctly guessing Ennis was of dual ethnicity. Rob Ford, an expert in diversity and migration at Manchester University, said: ‘Britain’s minorities seem to be following a similar path of integration trodden by many immigrants, such as the Irish, Poles and Italians, in America – gradually merging with the majority group until ethnic differences are no longer noticed or relevant.’","Olympic heptathlete Jessica Ennis hailed as 'face of the census' according to think-tank director .

"Fears that a new generation of debit cards could be hitting shoppers with phantom charges grew last night after a string of complaints. They say money was taken from their contactless payment cards – even when they did not try to use them – at stores including Marks & Spencer. The latest incidents come after similar complaints from shoppers at other stores and outlets. Shoppers at Marks and Spencer's Chichester branch were charged twice for items. The store takes more than 250,000 contactless card payments each week . Pret A Manger is said to be investigating claims by a customer who card was charged more than 11 inches from the reader . Shoppers say the M&S Smile cards . were charged without their permission while they were paying with a . standard bank card or cash. The . system, which can be used for goods worth up to £20, is supposed to . work only when the cards are placed within two inches of special . terminals at the checkout. But . customers who got in touch with the Money Box show on Radio 4 said they . were charged when the plastic was in their purse and well away from the . readers – meaning they unwittingly paid twice. And . sandwich chain Pret A Manger is said to be investigating similar claims . by a customer whose card was more than 11inches from a reader. A . victim of the M&S error, identified only as Rosemary, told Money . Box her Smile card was activated about a foot away from the reader at a . store in Chichester, West Sussex – even though she was paying with her . Lloyds debit card instead. She said: ‘I put my card into the reader and the assistant was asking whether or not I wanted cash back. ‘Before . I could answer, the transaction came up as complete and the till issued . a receipt, so I hadn’t put in a PIN at all at that stage. I . queried it with an assistant and she looked rather puzzled and looked . at the receipt and compared it to my card and realised that the numbers . didn’t tally.’ The number on the receipt belonged to the Smile card, which had been in her purse. She was given a full refund. Another . shopper, Paula, said she put her NatWest card into the terminal at a . London M&S store, only to find her contactless card was also charged . – even though it was in her purse. She was given her money back when she returned to the store with a bank statement. The errors have raised fears that other shoppers may have been double charged without their knowledge. M&S takes more than 250,000 contactless payments a week from the system, introduced last year, which it uses in all 644 of its UK stores. The retailer admitted receiving five complaints and said refunds were issued where double payments had been made. A spokesman said the system was ‘robust and fit for purpose’ but wanted to hear from any customer who had experienced the error. The system uses a weak radio signal to read data from the card’s chip. Visa Europe, which supplies the technology, said reports of involuntary payments were ‘extremely rare’ and it was working with M&S to examine the problem. The UK Cards Association, which represents debit and credit card firms, said: ‘We do think there is a bit more we can do in educating cardholders to tell them not to put their wallet down in this quite narrow field when they pay. There is perhaps more shops can do in terms of cashiers knowing there are two forms of payment.’","Marks and Spencer and Pret a Manger customers' cards activated inches from reader .

"She's one of the most recognisable women in Britain, so if you are a bank cashier and she approached you probably wouldn't even need to ask for identification. But apparently Katie Price's hair extensions, glamour model bust and trout pout aren't familiar to everyone. When a female fraudster - without even a passing resemblance to the famous pin-up - walked into a branch of HSBC, she somehow managed to pass herself off as Jordan. Now the fan who stalked the star, whose real name is Katie Price, is facing jail after admitting to stealing £2,500 from the celebrity using identity theft. Kerry Marshall, 18, who has 36E surgically-enhanced breasts, withdrew £14,000 from the star's bank account .

The teenager obtained details of Price's . bank account seven months earlier after tricking her way the model's . Sussex home by posing as a member of security staff. Then Marshall, wearing a blonde wig, went on to withdraw £1,000 from the star's bank account in September and six days later took out a further £1,500 at an HSBC branch. Marshall also bought a Mazda MX5 sports car using mother-of-three Price's bank details. She also bought a Pandora Bracelet and purchased hundreds of pounds worth of goods on the internet using a Pay Pal account. Marshall of Eastgate, Sleaford, pleaded guilty to five charges of fraud between 27 September and October 3. Marshall, formerly known as Tyler Meadows, was charged under her new female name after being arrested in her home town during the early hours of the morning of October 7. The investigation was launched after CCTV appeared to show a blonde woman wearing sunglasses withdrawing money at an HSBC branch in Lincolnshire. Katie Price rang her bank HSBC and was told a woman claiming to be her had reported her credit cards lost or stolen 24 hours earlier . Kerry Marshall bought a Mazda MX5 sports car using Katie Price's identity . Price became aware of the alleged fraud when three of her credit cards were declined while she was shopping in Brighton.

"Controversial: Former French fist lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has spoken of her views on feminism and a woman's role in society in an interview with Vogue magazine . Former French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has said that she believes a woman's place is in the home with her children and her generation of women 'don't need to be feminist'. The 45-year-old, a self-styled champagne socialist famed for her one-time Bohemian lifestyle, waded into the debate about a woman's role in society in an interview for Vogue magazine, with her views sure to outrage feminists. Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy said: 'There are pioneers who opened the breach. 'I'm not at all an active feminist. On the contrary, I'm a bourgeois. I love family life, I love doing the same thing every day.' Before marrying former French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, the former singer and model admitted that she found monogamy boring. She had previously been romantically linked with rock stars Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton as well as a number of famous politicians and businessmen. However, she soon turned into a conservative wife who shared her husband's right wing views on everything. But she admits that the couple disagree when it comes to gay marriage. She said: 'I'm rather in favour of homosexual marriage and adoption, I've lots of friends - women and men - who are in this situation and I don't see anything unstable or perverse in homo-parental families.' Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy says that her 58-year-old husband is opposed to gay marriage because he 'sees people in groups of thousands rather than as groups of people we know.' She has one child with Mr Sarkozy, a baby girl called Giulia, and an 11-year-old son, Aurelian, from her relationship with the philosophy professor Raphael Enthoven. Her life in the limelight has escalated since Mr Sarkozy lost the May presidential election to his Socialist rival, Francois Hollande. She is currently on billboards all over Paris advertising headphones, is appearing on glossy magazine covers, and has a new album out in February. All of this coincides with Mr Sarkozy being implicated in a number of fraud scandals, including one in which he is accused of illicitly accepting cash in contravention of electoral rules from Lilian Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress and France's richest women. Conservative: Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy shares many of husband Nicolas Sarkozy's views, but she admits that they disagree when it comes to gay marriage. The pair are pictured together earlier this year . It led to the Paris home Ms Bruni-Sarkozy shares with her husband being raided by police in July, but she refused to be drawn into questions about her husband's legal problems. 'I don't feel like talking about all that, and I won't do any more,' said Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, adding: 'The adventure was fun, but now I want to go back to being an ordinary citizen like everybody else. 'I no longer feel the desire nor the obligation to answer questions about a world that has enriched me humanly, which opened my eyes and mind, but in the end is not mine.' Mr Sarkozy has denied 'taking a penny' from Mrs Bettencourt, but was last week made an assisted witness in a case which could see him end up in a criminal trial.","Carla Bruni-Sarkozy told Vogue magazine that she is not an active feminist .

"Proposals for an NHS card have been sent to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . Britons could have to carry an ‘entitlement card’ to access free NHS care as part of a crackdown on health tourists, it emerged yesterday. David Cameron is considering plans to restrict free healthcare for immigrants to those who have lived here for more than a year, amid fears the cash-strapped NHS has become the ‘Global Health Service’. Reforms under discussion could mean immigrants having to wait six months or even a year before being granted habitual residency and therefore hospital care. But MPs say the scheme can only work if those entitled to free care can prove it. This would involve them presenting a card at the point of treatment. However, the idea could spark civil liberty concerns akin to the opposition to Labour’s plans to impose an identity card. And any plans to change the habitual residency test could be controversial. The European Commission is already unhappy that the UK has imposed such a test to prevent immigrants gaining access to all benefits and would be likely to oppose a plan to extend the test to entitlement to NHS care. Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, and Nicholas Soames, Tory MP for Mid Sussex, who co-chairman a cross-party parliamentary group on balanced migration, have written a letter to Jeremy Hunt to outline their proposal. They told the Health Secretary to ‘get this situation dealt with very soon’ to avoid a public backlash. The idea would be welcomed by many doctors who say they find it difficult to ask people whether they are entitled to NHS care for fear of appearing racist. Conservative plans to clamp down on immigrants’ access to free healthcare will be seen as an another attempt by the party to steal a march on UKIP after their second place in last week’s Eastleigh by-election. UKIP leader Nigel Farage claimed they pushed the Tories into third because David Cameron was too busy talking about issues such as wind turbines and gay marriage rather than immigration. Ill-fated: Labour's ID card plan failed . Mr Cameron has confirmed previous reports that he is backing plans to clamp down on immigrants’ access to free healthcare. He wants to do this by changing the ‘habitual residency test’, which is used to refuse certain benefits to immigrants. At present, it gives full access to NHS care to anyone permanently resident in the UK. Iain Duncan Smith, Work and Pensions Secretary, would like to see a habitual residence test for all handouts . In addition, hospitals will be compelled to enforce current rules which mean tourists and others who have no right to free care – including failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants – are charged for any services they receive on the NHS. A source close to Mr Hunt said there was concern that the NHS was being exploited by ‘more and more’ people from overseas, putting a strain on services. ‘The National Health Service is becoming the global health service,’ the source said. ‘We are looking at the way in which services are open to people. You have to be ordinarily resident to access healthcare. ‘We have to have a look at that and whether there is a prospect of changing that. We are looking in a bit more detail at the contributions you need [to have paid] to be entitled to free healthcare.’ The habitual residence test is used to decide whether migrants from the EU and elsewhere are eligible for certain benefits. Last month Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he wanted to see the test extended to all handouts, so that no one can claim a benefit unless they can show they have rented a home here for at least a year. Ministers want to get to grips with the issue before the expected influx of thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians next year once EU restrictions are lifted.","Care may be restricted to those who have lived in UK more than a year .

"Benefits claimants should be banned from spending welfare handouts on alcohol and cigarettes, a Conservative MP has said. Alec Shelbrooke wants to prohibit benefits being spent on luxury items by introducing electronic cash cards which could only be used for essential items such as food and clothing. The cards would be similar to a chip and pin debit card but with a blocking function for non-essential items, the MP for Elmet and Rothwell told the House of Commons. Essential swipe: The use of the card would be limited to necessary items such as food and clothing, effectively banning benefits claimants from buying booze and cigarettes . If people on benefits were to be prohibited from buying non-essential, desirable and damaging (NEDD) items, Mr Shelbrooke believes the public's perception of welfare claimants would improve. Mr Shelbrooke, a parliamentary private secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, said the plan would end the 'damaging perception' that those who claimed benefits were scroungers who sponge off the state. Restricting benefits: Alec Shelbrooke wants to limit benefits to essential items . 'When hard-working families up and down the country are forced to cut back on such non-essential, desirable items it is right that taxpayer benefits be only used for essential purposes,' Mr Shelbrooke told the House of Commons. Although the Bill drafted by Mr Shelbrooke has no realistic prospect of becoming law, the idea of benefits cash cards was raised by Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith during the Tory party conference earlier this year. Australia already uses a dedicated spending system where the 'Basics cards' scheme was launched nationwide in October. The cards can only be used to purchase 'priority' items such as food, housing, clothing, education and health care. The government puts the money electronically on the card once a fortnight, when people receive their benefit payments. Mr Shelbrooke said: 'If taxpayers are safe in the knowledge that claimants can no longer buy NEDD at the taxpayers' expense then the concept of welfare will be viewed once again as a responsible way of getting back on your feet.' 'That was what the welfare state was intended to be: a safety net in times of need, a hand-up, not simply a handout.'","MP Alec Shelbrooke wants to introduce restricted cash card for benefits .

"Police forces are using Twitter accounts intended to help fight crime to follow  gossip about hundreds of celebrities. The official accounts were found to follow the tweets of pop stars, sportsmen, fashion designers and TV shows. And although Twitter is free to use, many forces employ dedicated social media staff – funded by taxpayers – who are paid to monitor and maintain the accounts. Appropriate to follow? Official police Twitter feeds have come under the microscope after a complaint by a victim of crime in south London against Lambeth Police following pop star Rihanna . Guilty: Leicester Police swiftly unfollowed Coleen Rooney when they caught wind of the row in London . Popular: Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, left, is followed by Bedfordshire Police, while Hammersmith and Fulham officers are fans of Stephen Fry, right . Among the celebrities followed by police forces were Victoria Beckham, Rihanna, Simon Cowell, Lady Gaga and Downton Abbey. Scotland Yard ordered a clean-up of its official Twitter pages after receiving a formal complaint from a victim of crime. Since then police in Lambeth, south London, have deleted more than 500 links which were not work-related.

Last . night the crime victim who complained said she felt ‘sickened’ when she . discovered the police were ‘wasting hours entertaining themselves about . the exploits of celebrities’. More . than £2million of taxpayers' money has been spent to allow police . workers to the listen to the radio at work, it has emerged. While . forces in England and Wales have been hit sweeping budget cuts, the . incredible sum has been spent over the past three years for workplace . music licenses. Fees being spent include £60 for every patrol car and £54 for offices where music may just be played in the background. Larger areas such as canteens and staff sports clubs can be charged thousands of pounds, reports The Sun. The . biggest spender is the Metropolitan Police, which shells out £250,000 a . year. West Midlands Police came next, spending £62,000, while Thames . Valley was third on £44,000. Several . forces pay £25,000 a year but many pay nothing because their leaders . refuse to pay money to the Performing Rights Society, which collects . royalties for composers, songwriters and publishers. The . total annual £670,000 cost - revealed in Freedom of Information Act . responses - comes as thousand of frontline jobs have been axed to meet . budget cuts of millions of pounds. Conservative . MP Priti Patel said: 'Taxpayers' money should be used to investigate . crime and bring offenders to justice rather than pay for police officers . to listen to pop music. Police and Crime Commissioners must scrap this . perk and invest in putting bobbies on the beat.' South . Yorkshire Police insisted the £70,000 it spent in three yeasrs was . worth the cash because music is good for 'staff wellbeing'. The . 39-year-old woman, who was mugged in south London last month, said: ‘I . feel horrified that police staff are whiling away their time ogling . Rihanna or getting the latest on Simon Cowell, when the local streets . aren’t safe.’ Social media has been embraced by the police as a way to improve its image, particularly among young people.

"Controversy: Former EC president Jacques Delors made a u-turn over Britain's role in the single market . One of the key architects of the European single market today admitted Britain would be better off leaving the European Union. Mr Delors's radical U-turn comes 22 . years after he infuriated Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other . Eurosceptics by trying to force European federalism on the UK. In November 1990 the economist became the subject of a famous headline in the Sun newspaper which read: 'Up Your Delors!' Frenchman Jacques Delors, who was president of the European Commission three times, suggested that 'the British are solely interested in their own economic interests, and nothing else. We could offer them another kind of partnership.' In an interview in the German economic daily Handelsblatt, Mr Delors continued : 'If the British do not follow the tendency towards more integration in the European Union, we can anyway stay friends, but in another way.' Mr Delors suggested Britain might sign up for an agreement 'like that of the European economic area' or a 'free trade agreement'. If Britain does leave the EU, said Mr Delors, the country would still be a 'partner', because it is 'strategically and economically important'. But, in a typically cutting aside, Mr Delors said that 'other countries' were also important in the new economic order, including India and China. The United Kingdom belongs to the EU since 1973, but has not joined the Eurozone. On Thursday Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, warned that David Cameron's drive to repatriate powers from Brussels risks damaging the EU and could cause the collapse of the single market. Mr Van Rompuy - who chairs the EU's . summits - said the Prime Minister's attempts to achieve a new settlement . with Europe were destabilising the 27-member bloc. 'If . every member state were able to cherry-pick those parts of existing . policies that they most like, and opt out of those that they least like, . the union in general, and the single market in particular, would soon . unravel' said Mr Van Rompuy. Tense handshake: Jacques Delors pictured here with Prime Minister Thatcher in 1987 after a battle over European federalism . Jacques Delors (far left) and Prime Minister Thatcher pictured here with President George Bush and other European heads of state at an economic summit in 1990 . He . added: 'All member states can, and do, have particular requests and . needs that are always taken into consideration as part of our . deliberations. I do not expect any member state to seek to undermine the . fundamentals of our co-operative system in Europe.' Eurosceptic . Conservatives are concerned that the party could lose out to UKIP, the . UK Independence Party, in the 2015 general election unless Mr Cameron . makes more effort to boost British sovereignty over Brussels. Delors became the President of the European Commission in January 1985. During his presidency, he oversaw . important budgetary reforms and laid the groundwork for the introduction . of a single market within the European Community, which came into . effect on 1 January 1993. In the autumn of 1988 Delors . addressed the British Trade Union Congress, promising that the EC would . be a force to require governments to introduce pro-labour legislation. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . responded with her famous Bruges Speech in September 1988, in which she . said that she had not rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain . only to see them reimposed by a Brussels superstate. These developments were of key . importance for domestic UK politics – as recently as the early 1980s . large elements of the Labour Party had been opposed to British . membership of the EC, whereas the Conservatives had favoured joining. The Sun's now infamous headline made Prime Minister Thatcher's message loud and clear . Jacques Delors puts on a brave smile as he arrives ahead of talks with Mrs Thatcher . Facing a fight: Prime Minister David Cameron will now have to confront his own party's Eurosceptic camp following the comments from Jacques Delors . After 1988, however, it was to be the . Conservatives who were divided, with Thatcher and her supporters . opposed to further European federalism. On 1 November 1990, shortly before Thatcher was ousted as Prime Minister, Delors bore the brunt of British Euroscepticism. The Sun's famous headline sent the message loud and clear with 'Up . Yours Delors' in response to his supposed attempts to force European . federalism upon the UK.

The Sun's famous headline sent the message loud and clear with 'Up Yours Delors' in response to his supposed attempts to force European federalism upon the UK. The proposal from Mr Delors prompts concerns France might be willing to cut Britain loose, boosting the influence of Paris, as the EU moves to fiscal and political union in 2014 in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis. In a concerted campaign to keep Britain in Europe, Germany and senior European officials have warned that British demands to be able to ""cherry pick"" which bits of the EU it signs up to could unravel the whole bloc. Prime Minister Cameron is under pressure to give the British public a say on whether to leave the EU, demands that will be fuelled by the comments from Mr Delors. Mr cameron has said he supports continued EU membership but wants a 'new settlement'  involving Britain opting-out of justice measures and seeking exemptions to any further centralisation of power in Brussels. He is widely expected to make a speech in the New Year outlining plans for a referendum in 2015, which would voters a choice between a new relationship with Europe and leaving altogether. This includes committing to a national referendum on whether Britain wants to remain in the EU.","Former EC president Jacques Delors was architect of single market .

"Marijuana is the most used illegal drug worldwide but addiction to legal painkillers kills the most people, according to new research. Scientists found that cannabis was used more than cocaine and heroin in the first ever study of world-wide drug use. But experts from the University of Washington found that opioid painkillers such as vicodin, oxycontin and codeine caused more than half of the estimated 78,000 drug-related deaths worldwide. Study: Scientists have found that marijuana topped the list of most used illicit drugs worldwide, but prescription painkillers accounted for more than half of the estimated 78,000 drug-related deaths around the globe in 2010 . The study, which did not include data on ecstasy and hallucinogens, also found that men in their 20s are most likely to abuse drugs, with the highest rates of abuse found in Australia, the UK, Russia and the U.S. The research, which was published in The Lancet, found that the rate of drug-related deaths in countries that take a hard-line against illicit substance abuse was much higher than in states where the policy is to wean people off drugs by using methadone clinics and needle exchange programmes. Theo Vos, from the university's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and senior author of the study, said that although his team had few concrete numbers and had to rely on modeling techniques, the results still prove that there are drug problems in most parts of the world. Professor Vos added that people tended to abuse drugs produced close to home: cocaine in North America, amphetamines and opioids in Asia and Australia. The lowest rates of drug abuse were in Asia and Africa. New problem: Researchers warned that prescription drug abuse has only been a problem in the U.S for the past decade . Abuse: While cannabis is the most popular illegal drug used, the study found that people are more likely to use drugs made closer to home, for instance people in North America are more likely to abuse cocaine (file picture) Michael Lysnkey, of the National Addiction Centre at King's College London, who co-authored an accompanying commentary warned that prescription drug abuse in the U.S only appears to have become problematic in the last decade and warned that health officials will need to address the issue. He said: 'It's possible in another 20 years, patterns will again change in ways we can't predict.' In a related study, scientists also found that mental health and drug abuse problems including depression, schizophrenia and cocaine addiction kill more people worldwide than AIDS, tuberculosis, diabetes or road accidents. In some developing countries such as India, attempts to stop AIDS have slowed drug abuse as they focus on helping people kick their addictions, according to Vikram Patel, of the Centre for Global Mental Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Worrying: A separate study found that mental health and drug abuse problems including depression, schizophrenia and cocaine addiction kill more people worldwide than AIDS, tuberculosis, diabetes or road accidents . He recommended an approach to drug use similar to current controls on tobacco. He said: 'A decriminalized drug policy could potentially transform the public health approach to drug use. 'The enormous savings in the criminal justice system could be used to fund addiction treatment programs.' The results of the study were published as the the U.S Government confirmed that it will not sue the states of Colorado and Washington to stop them from legalising marijuana. Instead of trying to reverse the legalisation following a vote in November, the justice department said that it will try and focus on stopping underage access to the drug and keeping drug cash from criminals. As well as the two states which legalised the drug asap, 20 other states allow the drug to be used for medicinal purposes. Marijuana is still banned by federal law.","Prescription painkillers caused more than half of the estimated 78,000 worldwide drug-related deaths in 2010 .

"The Django Unchained actress who claims she was harassed by 'racist' LAPD officers used the N-word and declared that she knew her rights because she played a cop on TV after being handcuffed and detained, MailOnline can reveal. In between sobs and hysterics, Danièle Watts said: 'I know my rights, I played a cop on TV and I know that when someone asks for ID you aren't required to give it to them.' The new audio file, recorded by one of the officers on the scene and released exclusively to MailOnline by a law enforcement source, reveals the moment that police slapped handcuffs on Miss Watts after she walked away from an officer who asked to see her identification. MailOnline can also reveal that of the three officers who showed up to the scene, one is Hispanic, one is a woman and the third - LAPD Sergeant Jim Parker - is openly gay. Scroll down for exclusive audio . Sgt Jim Parker (center) has defended his handling of the Danièle Watts case - saying that she is barking up the wrong tree if she think she was discriminated against. Sgt. Parker revealed he is openly gay and says one of the officers on the scene is Hispanic (right) and the other is a woman . 'I played a copy on TV!' Daniele Watts, who has accused the LAPD of harassment, played police cadet Angela Mullen in the Showtime comedy 'Weeds' Miss Watts has repeatedly claimed that she didn't need to show her identification to officers who were called to a CBS lot in Studio City, California, last Thursday. When cops cuffed her, she claimed she knew her rights because of her acting experience. Miss Watts played police cadet Angela Mullen in eight episodes of the Showtime comedy 'Weeds' in 2012. Her other acting credits include Coco in the 2012 film 'Django Unchained' and Laura Jackson in the FX show 'Partners.' In the audio recording, Miss Watts sobs after being cuffed. An officer can be heard trying to calm her down. She tells him through tears: 'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me. 'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' Sgt Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he was offended by claims that Miss Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend. Sgt Parker said he's witnessed first hand many of the department's most dramatic moments - including the 1992 riots over the beating of black motorist Rodney King and the 1997 North Hollywood shoot out. Throughout his career, he says he has watched the LAPD become dramatically more sensitive to race relations and diversity. 'It’s a new generation. It’s not about who you are or what religion you are or what color you are, it's about who you are and what you do in uniform,' he told MailOnline. Sgt Parker, who is white, said that as Miss Watts ranted about being discriminated against for being black, she didn't take the time to realize that all three officers who responded to the scene were minorities. 'A gay officer, a female officer and a Hispanic officer were there,' he said. 'How funny it is. She kind of didn’t really get the right mix there. It’s quite comical.' Sgt. Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he is speaking out because he's seen the department become dramatically more sensitive since he's been on the force . Sgt Parker said that when the complaint about a couple having sex in their car came in, he happened to be right around the corner.  He quickly fingered Miss Watts and her boyfriend of 15 months Brian James Lucas as the suspects - though he said he had no intention of arresting anyone. Sgt Parker says he simply wanted to respond to the call and then grab a cup of coffee. Miss Watts and Mrs Lucas maintain they were doing nothing wrong - and that they were only making out, not having sex. Sgt Parker said he fears that if he and other officers had not recorded their run-in with Miss Watts, her allegations would have ruined their careers. 'She picked the wrong person to make a public incident out of a private matter,' he said. Miss Watts and Mr Lucas  dispute LAPD assertions that Miss Watts was legally obligated to show ID when asked. Mr Lucas wrote on his Facebook today: 'What we experienced this past Thursday, September 11 was the THIRD time in the past few months that D and I have had to deal with cops profiling a ""black and white couple."" This is the THIRD time, an officer has realized his error and had to let us go because we weren't breaking any laws.' He continues: 'As the LA Times and ACLU have said in the past few days, Daniele had every right NOT to show her ID!!! California does not have a stop and identify statute. According to California State Law, to investigate a potential arrest for lewd behavior (which is a misdemeanor), Sgt Parker would have had to seen us in the middle of the lewd act, OR had talked to a witness at the scene of the alleged crime.' The LAPD said it is conducting a review of the officers' behavior, but all three remain on the streets.","Actress Danièle Watts claimed she was harassed and racially profiled by the LAPD because she is black and her boyfriend is white .

"A Nigerian couple who tried to claim £3.8million in an ‘eye-watering’ benefits scam using 1,400 stolen identities have been jailed for a total of almost 10 years. Adeola Thomas, 38, assisted by his partner, Abimbola Abiola, 34, managed to pocket £87,000 after submitting almost 2,500 handwritten applications for tax credits and benefits. The pair spent the money on designer clothing and electrical items including a 50-inch plasma television. Adeola Thomas, left, was jailed for seven years while his accomplice Abimbola Abiola, right, was locked up for two-and-a-half years for charges relating to identity theft, tax and benefits fraud . But the fraud was discovered when benefits staff noticed the same address was being used for multiple claims, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Thomas, an illegal immigrant, was jailed for seven years while Abiola, also a Nigerian national with leave to remain in the UK, received two-and-a-half years. Passing sentence, Judge William Kennedy said: ‘This was no less than a criminal industry, with simple and eye watering criminality designed to maximise the loss to the public. ‘It was a difficult investigation carried out with skill and tenacity. ‘The largest single joint conspiracy [of its kind] for these departments and the actual loss was kept down because of the work of both departments.’ Judge Kennedy also indicated that both Thomas and Abiola should be deported at the end of their prison terms. The pair, who carried out the scam between January 3, 2007 and October 7, 2011, tried to claim £827,000 from HMRC, securing £43,000. They also claimed £3 million from the Department of Work and Pensions and received £44,000. With Abiola’s help, Thomas used stolen personal details to complete 2,495 handwritten application forms, which were sent to the appropriate departments for processing. When the claims were successful, the pair withdrew cash from acquaintances' bank accounts or from bogus post office accounts that Thomas, pictured, had set up . It is believed that others unknown to investigators, also provided postal addresses and assisted with correspondence. When the claims were successful, the pair withdrew cash from acquaintances' bank accounts or from bogus post office accounts that Thomas, who masterminded the scam, had set up. As well as analysing tax credit records, computer systems, hand written application forms and bank account details and listening to hours of recorded phones calls to the Tax Credit Helpline, HMRC investigators viewed CCTV footage showing activity outside various North London Post Office ATMs and carried out surveillance on Thomas.

"A former flight attendant has won a pay-out from Boeing after being exposed to toxic fumes in the cabin, sparking fears that countless passengers could be breathing in 'bad air'. Mother-of-two Terry Williams says her life was changed . by a single incident, when toxic smoke and oil fumes leaked into the cabin in April 2007 as an American Airlines flight from Memphis to Dallas taxied to the gate. Mrs Williams said she has suffered, among other symptoms, memory loss, tremors and speech and vision impairment. Lawsuit: Terry Williams claimed her exposure to 'bad air' came as oil fumes leaked into her MD-82 cabin as an American Airlines aircraft (similar to the ones pictured) taxied to the gate . During the incident on Flight 843 Mrs Williams, from Seattle, said her eyes began to water, her throat . tightened, she began to cough and she developed a headache that hasn't . gone away. The 42-year-old, who used to enjoy cooking . for her husband, Gary, and their sons, Zak, seven, and Jake, five, said: 'When I used to make French toast for . my family, first I'd make the bread. Now I . can't even remember the recipe.' She said that as well as memory loss, she suffers from disabling coughing spasms, asthma, sore throat, recurrent . tremors, fatigue, . nausea, speech impairment, loss of balance, vision impairment, and . numbness and tingling in her hands, arms, shoulders and feet. Toxic fumes: Terry William's settlement has sparked fears countless passengers may be exposed to 'bad air' on board aircrafts . Doctors diagnosed her with neurotoxic disorder due to exposure to the fumes. The amount and conditions of her out-of-court settlement remain confidential, but the 250,000 pages of company documents that Boeing . turned over to her legal team are certain to fuel . the long-running battle over the safety of cabin air in commercial aircraft. Boeing and the airline industry maintain that cabin air, compressed air pumped or 'bled,' from the . plane's engine — is safe. They say such breaches are extremely rare and . that short-term exposure to the tiny amounts of toxic substances poses no health risk. But Judith Murawski, a Seattle-area based . industrial hygienist for the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said she handles at least three new cases a . week involving crew members exposed to fumes. Many calls come from crew . members on their way to emergency rooms or urgent care clinics, she told . msnbc.com. While Terry Williams' lawsuit is believed to be the first of its type settled in the U.S., an Australian court held aircraft manufacturer British Aerospace liable for the injuries of Joanne Turner, a flight attendant for now-defunct East-West Airlines. Turner was five months pregnant in 1992 when she breathed thick smoke entering the cabin of a British-built BAe 146 on a Sydney-to-Brisbane flight. Following the exposure, she suffered a burning throat, sore eyes, a headache and a persistent cough. She sued East-West in 2001. In September 2010, the Australia High Court upheld her $138,757 award. A lower court found that it could have been predicted that the breakdown of seals on the plane's auxiliary power unit would allow toxic oil fumes to enter the cabin. British Aerospace in 1993 also paid East-West and Ansett airlines more than $2million to settle complaints about the BAe146, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Mrs Williams sued McDonnell Douglas and . its parent company, Boeing, in the Superior Court in King County, Washington in . 2009. She claimed the airplane maker knew that the plane and its . bleed-air system were defective and did nothing to protect her or . other passengers and crew. Boeing said it 'still contends that cabin air is safe to breathe . and studies by independent researchers have shown that . existing systems for providing cabin air to passengers and crew meet . applicable health and safety standards'. But airline crews say faulty 'bleed-air' systems have been causing health problems dating back to the start of jet travel in the 1950s. In severe cases exposure to . the toxic fumes has cost pilots their jobs. Passengers can even be put in danger if pilots experience aerotoxicity symptoms such as . drowsiness, disorientation and memory loss as a result of exposure. Experts say that out of 28,000 commercial flights per day, at least one will be affected by toxic fumes. Although every incident of contaminated air, which contains tricresyl phosphates (TCPs), is recorded, experts predict other toxic elements can cause illness. Giving evidence for Mrs Williams, U.S. Airways captain Mick Fowler said he suffered 'fatigue and wooziness and grogginess' during a 'fume incident' while landing a Boeing 767. Although he landed the plane safely in January last year, he said: 'It's not an experience that I would like to repeat at all.' Safe: Boeing has insisted cabin air, compressed air pumped, or 'bled,' from the plane's engine is safe, saying such breaches are extremely rare . As the case developed, Boeing was forced to turn over pages of documents dating to 1954 and 1955 that showed the company was aware of cabin air contamination and had sought detection and filtration systems to combat the problem. Executives also revealed in internal paperwork there could be health hazards related to exposure to toxic fumes when oil leaks into bleed-air systems. Sixteen U.S. Airways pilots and flight . attendants in April sued a U.S. Airways contractor, ST Aerospace Mobile, . over what they said was a failure in maintenance at its Mobile, Alabama, . servicing center. They claim this resulted in six fume events aboard the same Boeing 767 from December 28, 2009, to April 25, 2010. Among . the plaintiffs' symptoms were headaches, sore throats, eye irritations, . dizziness and nausea. Some also complained of fatigue and cognitive . difficulties. At least two plaintiffs were pilots who lost their medical clearances. In . August, the union representing 6,900 U.S. Airways flight attendants sent a . letter to FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt seeking an investigation of . 87 purported air supply contamination events in 2009 and 2010, 41 of . which were confirmed with mechanical records as oil-contamination . events. Boeing, like jetliner manufacturers Airbus and British Aerospace, has relied on bleed-air systems since the early 1950s. However, its new 787 Dreamliner instead has an air circulation system that uses electric compressors. Boeing spokesman Bret Jensen told msnbc.com that the decision to design a new system was based on fuel savings and environmental performance. 'It had nothing to do with bleed air,' he said. However, in a document Boeing sent to the FAA about its new plane the company cited concerns about carbon monoxide, which is released as TCP breaks down. Boeing also asserted that it met federal standards when its airplanes were certified by the FAA and therefore could not be held liable for Williams' injuries, but the court rejected that motion. American Airlines is now said to  have 'stepped up the game' and holds monthly meetings to address incidents. But other airlines have drawn criticism for their response to crew members' complaints. U.S. Airways spokesman John McDonald said the issue was an emotional one for flight attendants. In the two-year span cited in the letter, U.S. Airways had 2.2 million flights, Mr McDonald said. Of the 87 incidents the union listed, only 40 eventually turned out to be fume events, he added. Paul Morell, U.S. Airways' vice president for safety, said the airline tracks and works to prevent fume events.",Boeing settles out of court to woman suffering memory loss and tremors .
"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had said he wanted to broaden the social mix of students at top universities by forcing them to take more pupils from state schools . Rules which force top universities to take more students from state schools could be scrapped, it has emerged. The coalition introduced reforms last year which allowed universities to charge fees of up to £9,000 a year in return for recruiting more low-income pupils. The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said he wants to broaden the social mix of students at Britain's leading universities. But the move provoked a backlash from leading private schools who accused the Government of 'social engineering' and discriminating against some of their well-qualified students. Around half of the country's elite universities also boycotted the state school target this year. A senior government source told told the Daily Telegraph the quota system could now be axed. Critics said the reform has been made ineffective because an increasing number of middle-class families are now sending their children to top state schools because of the recession. It has also been argued that assuming poorer pupils always attend state schools while the richest are privately educated is too simplistic. 'It's a fair criticism and we probably need to look at it,' the source told the Telegraph. It would be another damaging compromise for Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg who faced criticism after he backed down on a manifesto commitment by allowing tuition fees to be increased in the first place. He has also had to concede ambitions for a so-called 'mansion tax' in the latest budget and reform to the House of Lords. The share of private school places at Cambridge plunged to a 30-year low this year with 63 per cent of freshers coming from state schools. The heads of leading private schools have fiercely protested against Government plans to force universities to take more pupils from state schools . It meant the university had already surpassed the Government's target of a 38/62 split by 2016/17. Nadhim Zahawi, a Conservative member of the Commons skills select committee, said the quota system is 'too crude'. 'It is much more complicated than that. It would be right to review the target,' he said.","Rules forced top universities to take more low-income pupils .

The move, which the US singer and actress showed off with the help of singer Robin Thicke, has been included in the latest revision of Oxford Dictionaries Online. Katherine Connor Martin, from Oxford Dictionaries Online, said 'twerk' was around 20 years old and seemed to have been coined as part of the 'bounce' hip-hop scene in the United States. 'By last year, it had generated enough currency to be added to our new words watch list, and by this spring, we had enough evidence of usage frequency in a breadth of sources to consider adding it to our dictionaries of current English,' she said. 'There are many theories about the origin of this word, and since it arose in oral use, we may never know the answer for sure.

'Hackerspace' (a meeting place for data enthusiasts) and 'bitcoin' (a digital currency that does not require a bank) have also made it . 'We think the most likely theory is that it is an alteration of work, because that word has a history of being used in similar ways, with dancers being encouraged to ""work it"". The ""t"" could be a result of blending with another word such as twist or twitch. 'The current public reaction to twerking is reminiscent in some ways of how the twisting craze was regarded in the early 1960s, when it was first popularised by Chubby Checker’s song, the Twist. 'Only time will tell if twerking will similarly be embraced by the general public.' The dance style’s listing reads: 'The twerk, v.: dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance.' Twenty-year-old Cyrus, who first rose to fame as the lead in Disney children’s show Hannah Montana, made headlines with the risque performance in a nude PVC bikini at the awards in New York on Sunday. The show saw her perform a medley of her party song We Can’t Stop and Thicke’s summer hit Blurred Lines while twerking furiously with the singer-songwriter.

"A patient who received the world's first double-leg transplant has had both limbs amputated after being struck down by an unrelated illness, it was confirmed today. The man, who was in his 20s when he had the operation in 2011, was forced to stop taking his anti-rejection drugs so he could be treated for the illness. The Hospital Le Fe, in Valencia, Spain, said the patient has already undergone the operation to amputate both legs. The double leg transplant was led by surgeon Pedro Cavadas (pictured) but the patient was forced to have the legs amputated after treatment for an unrelated illness meant he had to stop taking his anti-rejection drugs . A statement released by the hospital said the new treatment took precedence over the immuno-suppressant drugs. A spokesman said: 'In these cases the protocol is that, if the transplanted organ is not a vital organ, it should be removed from the patient so as to allow treatment of the illness that is more serious and urgent', according to AFP. The patient, who initially lost his legs above the knees after a road accident, has not been named. He was given the transplant as he faced life in a wheelchair because attempts to fit him with prosthetic limbs had failed. The 14-hour milestone transplant was led by Spanish surgeon Pedro Cavadas in 2011. It was the first leg transplant of any kind. Valencia's Hospital La Fe said treatment for the illness takes precedence over saving the legs . Fifty surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and other staff at the hospital worked on the operation to give the man the . legs of another person. The bones were attached first, followed by tendons, arteries and nerves. About eight months after the operation, the hospital said the man was recovering well and was able to stand in a swimming pool. Mr Cavadas also carried out Spain's first face transplant in 2009 and was the first anywhere in the world to include a tongue and jaw. He has also carried out several arm transplants.","Patient stopped taking anti-rejection drugs so his illness could be treated .

"One in ten young people have admit being sexually violent towards their partner, shocking new statistics show. The majority of 14 to 21-year-olds, questioned by the University of New Hampshire, reported using coercive . tactics, such as arguing, putting pressure on a partner, getting angry . or making someone feel guilty, rather than using threats or physical . force. However, two per cent of respondents admitted rape and three per cent admitted attempted rape. Most often the victims were a romantic partner and more than half of the perpetrators blamed the victim for the sexual violence, although many said they had also seen films or . other media that depicted sexual and violent situations. The majority of young people questioned by the University of New Hampshire reported using coercive tactics, such as arguing, putting pressure on a partner, getting angry or making someone feel guilty. However, two per cent of respondents admitted rape and three per cent admitted attempted rape . The most common first-time age for experiencing sexual violence was 16 years old, but males were overwhelmingly more . likely to be sexually violent to a partner at 15 years of age or younger. Yet nearly all escaped punishment because the victim told no-one, according to the researchers. The American study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, found nine per cent of those aged 21 or younger reported to carrying out some form of sexual violence. While eight per cent kissed, touched or made someone else do something sexual knowing the other person did not want to. The study estimated adolescent sexual . violence perpetration after . analysing data for 1,058 young people between the ages of 14 and 21 in the Growing Up with Media study. They focused on sexual violence as coercive and forced sexual behaviour. The most common first-time age for sexual violence was 16 years old. Males were found to be overwhelmingly more likely to be sexually violent towards a female from 15 years of age or even younger. Yet nearly all escaped punishment because the victim told no-one, claims researchers . Three per cent admitted to having coercive sex by getting someone to sleep with them when they knew the other person didn't want to, and another three per cent attempted rape. Dr Kimberly Mitchell of the University of New Hampshire said: 'Links between perpetration and violent sexual media are apparent, suggesting a need to monitor adolescents’ consumption of this material, particularly given today’s media saturation among the adolescent population. 'Because blaming victims appears to be common while perpetrators experiencing consequences is not, there is urgent need for high school and middle school programmes aimed at supporting bystander intervention.'","Study questioned teenagers and young people in schools across the U.S .

"Cleaning cars and performing somersaults for £2.30. It was once all in a day's work for Arsenal ace Alexis Sanchez. The 25-year-old cost the Gunners £30million when he arrived from Barcelona in the summer. But the forward, who is understood to be pocketing a wage of £150,000-a-week, has reflected on his childhood in Chile where he couldn't even afford to buy a new pair of boots. Alexis Sanchez trains with his Chile team-mates in Santiago ahead of their friendly against Peru . Sanchez - seen here celebrating after scoring against Man City - has made a solid start to his Arsenal career . 'My first pair of boots were given to me by the Mayor of Tocopilla after my mum went to speak with him,' said Sanchez, as reported by the Daily Express. 'One day he turned up at my house and just gave me them. I was made up, like a dog with two tails! 'As I could do somersaults, people would say to me, 'do a somersault and we'll give you 50 or 100 Pesos'. 'I also used to clean cars.' Sanchez is back in his native Chile as he prepares to take on South American rivals Peru in a friendly on Saturday, before taking on Bolivia next Wednesday (October 15). Sanchez's tale is one that has taken him from rags to riches via River Plate, Udinese and Barcelona . Manchester United target Arturo Vidal (centre) is also part of the Chile squad to play Peru . Despite playing in the top tiers of Italian and Spanish football, with Udinese and Barcelona, Sanchez insists the Premier League is the hardest. 'Compared to the other leagues I've played in, I think this is the hardest and I like it a lot, I really do,' Sanchez told Arsenal.com. 'Before I signed, people had told me about how Arsenal were a big club with lots of quality players. Now I'm here I look at all the players during training and realise just what fantastic quality they all have.' With a wealth of attacking talent at the Gunners, Sanchez has started life at Arsenal in a variety of forward roles but admits he feels 'slightly more comfortable' when he is deployed on the right. 'I can run and cut inside on my left foot, but any position is good for me as long as I'm playing football because I hate being on the bench,' added Sanchez. 'If you take me off it's like you're taking the ball off me. 'I want to win everything. Looking at the coaches and players we have, with a winning attitude and ambition, we can win absolutely anything.' Sanchez, attempts to evade the challenge of Branislav Ivanovic, insists the Premier League is the hardest test . Arsenal entertain Hull on October 18 and will be looking to get their title bid back on track following last weekend's defeat by Chelsea. Manager Arsene Wenger will be hoping the former Udinese star comes through the international break unscathed, following Wednesday's news that injured Mesut Ozil faces 12 weeks on the sidelines. Sanchez has thrilled Arsenal fans with some stellar performances, collecting the club's player of the month award for September.

"A woman has given HIV to her lesbian lover in an extremely rare case of female-to-female HIV transmission, according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The 46-year-old Texan woman 'likely acquired' the virus from her HIV-positive female partner. Such reports are incredibly rare, but the women were noted to have engaged in several risky behaviors and the diagnosed woman had stopped taking her medication in 2010. Scroll down for video . Rare: A CDC report out Friday details the case of a Texas woman who became HIV positive in an extremely rare incidence of female-to-female transmission (here, the virus is shown in yellow attacking a cell in blue) The 46-year-old unnamed woman tested positive and indicated she had had sex with only her female partner in the six months prior to her diagnosis. She also said she had not engaged in sex with a man for 10 years. The woman reported no HIV risk factors - besides sex with her 43-year-old partner - such as getting tattooed, having multiple unprotected sexual partners or IV drug use. The report indicated that the newly infected woman's HIV strain was a 98 percent genetic match with her partner's. The study notes no other cases that can be classified as female-to-female HIV transmission with as much certainty, citing that in most other cases 'other risk factors almost always are present or cannot be ruled out'. Despite its rarity at the outset, the case's particulars make it less shocking. 'They described their sexual contact as at times rough to the point of inducing bleeding in either woman,' reads the report. 'They also reported having unprotected sexual contact during the menses of either partner.' Report: The CDC report notes the rarity of this type of transmission, but also details the higher-risk behavior that the newly infected woman engaged in with her partner, whom she knew to be HIV positive . The known positive partner was prescribed antiretrovirals in 2008 and reported that she stopped taking them in 2010 and was 'lost to follow up in January 2011,' AFP reports. When a patient is taking antiretroviral drugs the viral load in their blood is so low that it is very unlikely they will pass on the virus. However, if they stop taking the medication, the viral load will increase again and they are more likely to pass on the virus. Paul Ward, Acting Chief Executive at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'Sex between two women carries an extremely low risk of HIV transmission. 'However, in any sexual pairing, the risk of transmission increases when one of the couple has HIV but is not on treatment. 'In this case, when the HIV-positive partner stopped taking anti-HIV drugs in 2010, it is likely the amount of virus in her blood increased dramatically. 'Modern drug treatments don’t just keep people with HIV fit and well; they can also greatly reduce the risk of infection.'","Texan woman has been infected with HIV by her female partner .

Arsenal are in the United States for a friendly against Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise New York Red Bulls, before heading to Austria for a training camp and then returning to London for the Emirates Cup. 'These training camps in the modern game are decided for commercial reasons and because of the extent of popularity of the club,' the Frenchman told a news conference on Thursday. 'We've never been to the States before and I was very happy to come to New York - a city I love. 'But for purely football reasons, the best thing to do is stay and not travel too much because of the time you waste and the jet-lag you suffer is not ideal.' Worry: Wenger is concerned about the effects of travel on his players in run-up to new season . Arsenal are without a host of internationals following the World Cup and Wenger highlighted the difficulty in players beginning the intense domestic campaign so soon after returning from the tournament. 'This season is a post-World Cup year and very difficult because the time is very short between the final, which was on July 13, and the start of the new season on August 16. 'And compulsory, from FIFA, you are obliged to give four weeks' holiday to the players, so I don't know how all that works together. It looks, to me, impossible.' Wenger's comments came days after Van Gaal said Manchester United's pre-season tour was wrongly being dictated by the club's commercial interests. Commitment: Kriss Olsson and Issac Hayden take part in training session in New Jersey on Thursday . United beat Los Angeles Galaxy 7-0 on Wednesday, and now face games in Denver, Washington and Detroit. Van Gaal's team potentially face a fifth game on August 4, less than two weeks before they kick off their Premier League season at home to Swansea City on August 16. 'More or less, yes,' Van Gaal told British media in the United States, when asked whether the demands were hindering their preparations. 'We have to prepare the season and when you have commercial activities and dreadful distances, having to fly a lot and the jet lag, it is not very positive for a good preparation.'

"They are the prodigies, the rising stars of the global game. Flourishing for club and country, these teenagers are hoping to make their breakthrough on the world stage - and soon. With the international week in full swing, we take a look at 10 of the most exciting players on the planet under the age of 20 and what they've achieved in their careers so far. MOSQUITO (18, Brazil Under 20 and Atletico Paranaense) Don't be fooled by the funny name, Mosquito - or Thiago Rodrigues da Silva - is one of the hottest properties in Brazil. The striker was part of the incredibly talented Under 20 squad that went goal crazy in winning the Toulon Tournament in the summer and has long been admired by many of the European heavyweights. Now 18, he has been involved in the Selecao set-up for five years and first made headlines when he scored 10 goals in seven matches at the Under 15 South American Championship. His subsequent move from Vasco da Gama to Atletico Paranaense caused controversy as it is generally agreed that players under the age of 17 are not hawked around by agents. Mosquito celebrates his goal for Brazil against Russia at the FIFA Under 17 World Cup last year . The forward has proved himself a deadly finisher and is expected to ultimately make the move to Europe . KELECHI IHEANACHO (18, Nigeria Under 17 and Manchester City) Tipped as the 'next big player' to come out of Africa, Iheanacho has already enjoyed some big moments in his career for club and country. The Nigerian hotshot was very impressive on Manchester City's pre-season tour of the United States, even scoring in the 4-1 win over Sporting Kansas City, having won a place on the flight to America by impressing during a training camp for the fringe players in Scotland. He has certainly caught the eye of Yaya Toure, who said: 'Kelechi is an exciting player. I love the way he plays and I feel that he will have a good career at the club and go on to become one of the players of the future.' Internationally, he was the star of Nigeria's triumph at the 2013 Under 17 World Cup, scoring six goals and contributing seven assists as they lifted the trophy in the United Arab Emirates. Kelechi Iheanacho in action for Nigeria against Mexico at the FIFA Under 17 World Cup last year . OLIVER TORRES (19, Spain U21 and Porto, on loan from Atletico Madrid) Part of the Spain Under 21 squad that will take on Serbia for a place in next summer's European Championship over the coming weekend, forward-thinking midfielder Oliver stands out even in such a prodigiously talented group. Currently on loan at Porto - where he has scored once in three matches so far - from parent club Atletico Madrid, he is tipped for a very bright future. Two-footed with exceptional passing and vision, Oliver has already featured in the Atletico first team and was a member of the Spain squad that won the 2012 European Under 19 Championship. Oliver Torres (right), who is on loan at Porto from Atletico Madrid, in action against Shakhtar Donetsk . TIMO WERNER (18, Germany Under 19 and Stuttgart) Known as the next Sami Khedira. Or is it Thomas Muller? Or perhaps Mesut Ozil? Whatever the comparison, Timo Werner is well on his way to fulfilling his huge potential for both club and country. At the start of last season it was obvious the forward had outgrown the youth team at Stuttgart and so, at the age of just 17 years, four months and 25 days - a club record - he lined up for the first team in a Europa League tie with Botev Plovdiv. He has since appeared regularly for Stuttgart, scoring four times. Werner is also just the latest off the German production line as they try to retain their World Cup crown four years from now in Russia. He has been a regular scorer at every age level so far, notably the Under 17s, where he got 16 in 18 matches. Timo Werner playing for Germany in an Under 19 international with Holland last month . AGUSTIN ALLIONE (19, Argentina Under 20 and Palmeiras) Very talented right winger who has been the subject of enquiries from Manchester City and Barcelona, on the recommendation of Lionel Messi, no less. The 19-year-old winger won't be coming to Europe just yet, however, having only recently signed for Brazilian club Palmeiras from Velez Sarsfield in his Argentine homeland. Allione is just 5ft 6.5in but makes up for his slight build with abundant skill and speed. He was part of the Velez squad that won the 2013 Argentinian championship and has represented his country at Under 17 and Under 20 levels. Agustin Allione receives the ball during an Argentina vs Colombia match at the 2011 South America U17 Cup . Winger Allione (right) in action for former club Velez Sarsfield in the Copa Libertadores . BRUMA (19, Portugal Under 21 and Galatasaray) Called up to the Portugal senior squad last October - in place of Cristiano Ronaldo no less - fleet-footed winger Bruma was being touted as a wildcard for Paulo Bento's squad at the World Cup. But then disaster struck and the Galatasaray man suffered a serious knee injury that not only ended his season but also any hope of being on the plane to Brazil. It was particularly ill-timed as Bruma was also starting to make an impression for his club after joining from Sporting Lisbon the previous summer. No matter, the 19-year-old is back to full fitness and has plenty of time to fulfil his obvious potential. Bruma reacts after hitting the crossbar in Portugal's match with Cuba at the FIFA Under 20 World Cup . Bruma (right) uses his acceleration to get clear of Ghana's Seidu Salifu at the Under 20 World Cup . NICOLA MURRU (19, Italy Under 21 and Cagliari) Part of the Italy Under 21 squad that will play Slovakia in the European Championship play-offs this week, left back Murru seems destined for the big time. The Cagliari talent has long been linked with a move to one of Italian football's leading lights, such as Juventus or Milan. He has come through the ranks at his hometown club and made his first-team debut back in December 2011. Murru is equally as capable with his defensive duties as with pushing forward as a flying wing back. Has just this year been promoted to the Azzurri Under 21 squad. Nicola Murru in training for Italy ahead of an Under 21 match earlier this year . Murru in the colours of club Cagliari flying down the wing in a Serie A encounter with Sassuolo . TONNY VILHENA (19, Holland Under 21 and Feyenoord) It's a testament to  Vilhena's abilities that he has 74 appearances for Feyenoord under his belt and is still only 19. He is deployed by the Eredivisie side to perform both defensive and offensive duties and is very capable of doing both. The left-footed teenager is a fine passer of the ball and packs a powerful shot too. Vilhena came through the youth ranks at the Rotterdam side and made his debut in January 2012. His feats for the Oranje have been equally impressive, helping the Under 17 team to victory in the 2011 and 2012 European Championships. Holland's Tonny Vilhena in action during an Under 21 qualifying match with Luxembourg back in June . FABRICE OLINGA (18, Cameroon and Apollon Limassol on loan from Malaga) Still only 18, Olinga already holds a few significant records - he became La Liga's youngest goalscorer at 16 years and 98 days when he found the net for Malaga against Celta Vigo on the opening day of the 2012-2013 season. The striker is also Cameroon's youngest ever scorer after breaking the record of Samuel Eto'o on his debut against Cape Verde in October 2012. And he was an unused sub in his country's World Cup squad over the summer. Comparisons with the great man have become part of the burden Olinga must bear and it doesn't help that he was spotted when at Eto'o's football academy back home. It now remains to be seen how his career develops - Olinga is currently on loan with Apollon Limassol havign spent a bit of time in Belgium with Zulte Waregem last season. The game time can surely only help this big talent. Cameroon star Fabrice Olinga showing off his trickery in training during the World Cup in Brazil . DIEGO FAGUNDEZ (19, Uruguay Under 20 and New England Revolution) Usually, South American stars flourish at a club in their homeland before taking the well-trodden route to Europe for a megabucks sum. Not so Fagundez, whose family moved from Montevideo to Massachusetts when he was just five. Consequently, his talent has been nurtured in the United States and, more specifically, by MLS club New England Revolution, whom he joined at the age of 14. Indeed, he was the first academy player the Revolution brought through when contracted in November 2010. Attacking midfielder Fagundez has an effective combination of acceleration, control and instinctive finishing that make him highly effective.

"Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United revolution has even extended to the children’s creche at Old Trafford. The play area where United’s stars used to leave their kids on match days while they socialised with their wives and girlfriends in the players’ lounge next door has been converted into a medical room on the instruction of United’s new manager. Previously, the creche was situated between the medical room and the lounge, but it has been knocked through to double the size of the treatment room. Louis van Gaal listens to what his assistant Ryan Giggs has to say on the Old Trafford touchline . The creche was located next to the players' lounge at Old Trafford . The old players’ lounge, which was also next to the home dressing-room at Old Trafford, has been split in two – one half is now a pre-match warm-up area and the other is an interview room for overseas media rights holders - while a new combined players’ lounge and children’s area has been relocated elsewhere in the stadium. A club source told The Sun: ‘Scrapping the historic players’ room and creche has created a bit of a stir. But Van Gaal was adamant with what he wanted and everyone has had to fall in line. ‘The players’ lounge is now a warm-up area and team members are invited into a different part of the stadium to spend time with their families. Wayne Rooney leaves Carrington - where sweeping changes have been made by Van Gaal - earlier this week . Angel Di Maria - who like Rooney has young children - will not be able to use the creche . ‘The creche is gone and has not been moved elsewhere.’ It is the latest change implemented by Van Gaal since he took over in the summer after the Dutchman ordered a £3million overhaul of United’s Carrington training base. Two training pitches have been ripped up and replaced with the identical Desso surface that is used at Old Trafford, a £500,000 video surveillance system has been installed so Van Gaal can analyse his squad more closely in training, and sleeping pods are available for players to rest in between double training sessions rather than having to go home. The manager has also introduced a strict 1pm mealtime with rectangular canteen tables replaced by circular ones and all the players ordered to speak in English. Van Gaal has made several changes to United's infrastructure at Old Trafford and Carrington .","Creche was located next to players' lounge at Old Trafford .

"A school security officer who had sex with a 15-year-old student has escaped jail - much to anger of the teen victim's mother. Patience Perez of Norfolk,Virginia was sentenced to two years in jail with all but seven months suspended. The judge told the 24-year-old she can remain free as long as she undergoes counseling and meets other conditions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Patience Perez, 24, won't have to do jail time as long as she goes to counseling . Patience Perez was also once thought to be plotting her husband's murder with her 15 year-old victim but police later dropped the charges . But the boy's mother lashed out at the lenient sentence saying it was like 'an arrow to the heart'. The mum said: 'We haven't wrapped our brain around it,' 'It doesn't make sense. It's like we endured all this pain all this stress and for this to happen. Just like an arrow to the heart.' In an earlier interview the mother had claimed Perez 'preyed on my baby'. 'She took advantage of teenage boy that had depression issues, anger issues, ' she said . The mother, who has not been named, discovered the affair when she found a naked photo of Perez on her son's phone last March. Patience was a former security guard at the Virginia Beach Renaissance Academy in Virginia . Patience will need to stay away from the boy and from his family is she wishes to stay out of jail . Perez left Norfolk County Court on Friday hand in hand with her husband Gilbert. He had stood by her after she was arrested last April on charges of underage sex. Charges that Perez conspired with her teen lover to have him killed were dropped at an earlier hearing. Court documents revealed that Perez had told her teen lover her husband was abusing her and they plotted to have him killed. Facebook messages between the pair detailed the murder for hire plot. Police in Norfolk dropped the charges. She 'preyed on my baby,' said the boy's mother (pictured) who can't understand why patience is avoiding jail time . Perez had met the student while working as a security officer at the Renaissance Academy in Virginia Beach. They had sex on multiple occasions while her sailor husband was away at her home in Norfolk. She also had sex with the teen at his home in Virginia Beach. The couple also sent each other pornographic pictures on their cell phones. Their affair came to an end after the boy's mother found Perez's naked picture and went to the school. She initially thought Perez was another student but learned she was an assistant security officer. Perez was told by the court all but seven months of the two year sentence was being suspended. The judge told her she will have to register as a sex offender and stay away from her victim. If she completes a counseling course she will not have to go to jail. Perez still faces child sex charges in Virginia Beach and the victim's mum said she hopes that court will not be as lenient. 'I hope that that prosecutor cares more about my family than Norfolk did, ' The boy's mother told News Channel 3.","The judge told the 24-year-old, Patience Perez, she can remain free as long as she undergoes counseling and meets other conditions .

"Guilty: LaTangela Williams, pictured, has been jailed and was also told she faces three years of probation for having sex with her students . A health teacher has been jailed for 14 months after admitting to having sex with two students. LaTangela Williams was also told she faces three years of probation and will lose her teaching certificate. The 36-year-old pleaded guilty to engaging in sex with two students from Selma High School in Selma, Alabama. She was arrested on the school campus last April after police waited for her to leave her classroom before taking her away. Williams was charged with having images of a juvenile engaged in obscene acts and having sexual contact with a student. She was also charged with enticing a minor for immoral purposes and solicitation of a child. One of the alleged student was a basketball player for the high school, according to WSFA. Dallas County District Attorney Michael Jackson said he was happy with the plea deal. 'This gets her out of the school system,' Jackson said. 'It should show that we are not going to let anyone get away with touching school children.' Williams is expected to report to jail next week after completing some family matters, according to her defense attorney Theron Stokes. 'We felt like it was in her best interest to accept the plea deal,' Stokes said. 'We wanted to get this behind her and move on. We intend for her to do well in the future. This is not a reflection on the school system, but of one employee's mistakes.' Jackson said Williams is required to begin serving her time on April 11.

Chief Administrative Officer and acting Superintendent of the Selma City School System, Larry DiChaiara said: 'While I am pleased with the outcome, Ms. Williams is very fortunate to receive the sentence that she received. 'When I heard the outcome, my heart went immediately to those students who were the victims of her actions while under her care. That is where my thoughts are today. 'In addition to the sentence, based on the criminal charges and her plea of guilt, she will also have her teaching certificate revoked and never be able to work with children again in our schools. 'It is my hope that this verdict sends a strong message to anybody who is entrusted with our children that this kind of behavior will never again be tolerated.'","LaTangela Williams was also told she faces three years of probation and will lose her teaching certificate .

"An amateur photographer has used super speed cameras to capture the world's most iconic brand names and fictional characters by snapping them - in water droplets. Arik Kfir, 45, a policeman from Beer-Sheva in Israeli began 'liquid drop art' in 2011 after he bought his first digital Canon camera. Since he started his project, Mr Kfir has captured cartoon favourites like Bart Simpson, Popeye and Garfield with his extraordinary photographic technique. Israeli artist Arik Kfir creates artwork using water droplets and iconic images, such as this character from hit game Angry Birds . Mona Lisa smile: Da Vinci's iconic and enigmatic portrait is given the drop art treatment. Right, Sunflowers by Van Gogh is reflected twice in two separate droplets . The smiley icon popularised by rave culture, framed in bright yellow . Mr Kfir sets up his camera and flash rigs to capture the exact moment a droplet hits the surface, sometimes causing several drops to collide into each other. By dropping the water in front of pictures of brands and cartoon characters, the droplets create a unique reflection of the images a fraction of a second before the drop bursts. The process can be painstakingly slow and Mr Kfir often takes an entire day to capture just one perfect picture which he does from his kitchen. He said: 'It is quite a complex thing to do and very hard as water droplets are tiny, but it is my hobby and I enjoy it. 'I set up in my kitchen by putting a full glass of water in the middle of the table, I then set up the camera in front of it before placing flash guns around and above the water. The process can be painstakingly slow and Mr Kfir often takes an entire day to capture just one perfect picture . The Apple drops: Tech giant and businessman Steve Jobs. Right, A.A. Milne's beloved creation Winnie-the-Pooh . Fat Cat: This image of comic strip character Garfield features mesmerising colours .

'Next, I put an image behind the water, the image has to be upside down due to the reflection in the water. 'I then use an I.V bag, like you would find in a hospital, to hang above it and I wait for the water from that to drip into the glass of water below. 'Once it does, it is all about timing and speed, I use a remote control to take the picture and hopefully, if everything goes to plan, the end result is a sharp, in focus and well lit piece of liquid drop art. 'As I said, it is complex and it does take a lot of practice, but in my opinion it is worth it as I think the images look brilliant and are something different for others to admire. What's up doc? By dropping the water in front of pictures of brands and cartoon characters, the droplets create a unique reflection of the images a fraction of a second before the drop bursts . The art of science: Albert Einstein captured in a water droplet. Right, The Pink Panther. The artist said: 'I do get lots of people asking if I can capture their favourite football team or even themselves' 'I love the colours in the cartoons I have photographed, they are what I like to see, bright colours. My wife doesn't mind me doing my projects in the kitchen, just as long as I keep it clean. 'I don't make any profit out of doing what I do, I simply do it for the love of art and I wouldn't have it any other way. 'I do get lots of people asking if I can capture their favourite football team or even themselves, which I don't mind doing.' A clown's face is given the Arik Kfir treatment.

Water pipe: The recognisable silhouette of detective Sherlock Holmes . Waterworld: Mr Kfir says the images are all about timing and speed. Right, British comedy actor Charlie Chaplin . He added: 'They expect to pay for it but I don't see the point, it isn't much trouble for me so I either put them on my website or Facebook or just send it to them, it is no problem. 'I hope to continue my art and get better, it may give me a career after the police force but you never know, for now I am just enjoying it. 'I would advise anyone to get into it, I didn't think I would be able to do it but photography has made me see the world differently, it has given me a new outlook on life.'

"A 55-year-old investment banker from Manhattan who was the sole American fighting for the Ukraine in the eastern European war has been killed in combat. Mark Gregory Paslawky, who was born and raised in New York, joined the war against the separatist Russia-backed rebellion - which has already claimed over 2,000 lives and displaced over 300,000 - because of his Ukrainian lineage. However according to Vice magazine, he died on Tuesday from gunshot wounds sustained in a battle in the city of Ilovaysk. 'He had three wounds in his back,' Ukrainian photographer Maxim Dondyuk told the magazine. Scroll down for video . Killed: Mark Gregory Paslawsky, 55,  was among nine Ukrainian troops shot during intense fighting in the transportation hub of Ilovaysk, near Donetsk, on Wednesday . Carnage: Paslawky was killed over an intense few days of fighting in Ilovaysk, a transportation hub near Donetsk (pictured) Deciated: Mark Paslawky said in an interview earlier this month that he is not married and does not have children, otherwise he wouldn't have chosen to fight in the Ukraine . 'He was saying that he was in pain and that he didn’t want to die. 'People were telling him he was going to be OK. 'I think it might have been possible to save him if we had medevac helicopters or ambulances, but all there was on hand were the battalion medics.' Paslawky told Vice in August that his decision to join the war came from watching news reports of the worsening situation in Ukraine after Moscow's annexation of Crimea. 'Given what I saw, the level of incompetence, the corruption, the lack of activity — I just decided that I needed to go and participate,' he told Vice. 'If there was ever a time to help Ukraine this was the time to do it.' A long-time former Army Ranger, Paslawsky worked in the financial sector and was based out of Kiev, Kharkiv, and Moscow for many years. Friends say they believed him to be quite wealthy, but was not one to 'use his money'.

Street battles were raging in Ilovaysk, a key railway hub some 45 kilometres (30 miles) east of Donetsk, with authorities saying nine soldiers died in the area in the last 24 hours, including a US national who fought for a Ukrainian volunteer battalion . Paslawsky told Vice he did not have a wife or children. 'No. I'm not crazy like that, I wouldn't be here if I did,' he said. Ukrainian forces have battled separatist rebels to capture the town of Ilovaysk for the last three days, according to Vice. They are trying to cut the rebels off from their own capital, Donetsk, to keep them from the Russian border and supplies.","New York native Mark Gregory Paslawky, 55, killed in Ilovaysk, a transportation near Donestk, on August 19 .

"If your car happens to be a Honda Accord, now might be a good time to install an alarm. And a really good one at that. The familiar family car has been named the most popular vehicle to get stolen as part of a new list released by Forbes magazine.

Coming a close second was the Honda Civic, of which 45, 001 were stolen, followed by the Chevrolet Silverado (27, 809) and the Ford F-150 (26, 494).

Taking out the top spot was the Nissan Altima, with 810 vehicles reported as stolen. Not far behind was the Ford Fusion (793), the Ford F-150 (775) and the Toyota Corolla (669). Newer cars are often stolen and then resold with doctored paperwork, however are much harder to break into it. Conversely, older cars are often easier to access and are dismantled and sold for their parts. While the figures in the new list appear high, especially in terms of the Honda Accords that were stolen, the FBI says car thefts are actually down. Although the 2013 numbers have not been completely finalized, they are expecting to a post a 50 percent drop since 1991, when car thefts were at their peak. They are expecting less than 700,000 cars to have been stolen last year, which is a 3.2 percent improvement on 2012. Prized: The 2013 Nissan Altima was the most stolen new car last year . The 2013 Ford Motor Co. Fusion was the second most stolen new car last year . Third place: Some 775 models of the 2013 Ford F-150 were stolen last year . Some 669 models of the 2013 Toyota Corolla were stolen last year . According to Forbes, the NCIB has informed car owners to take a 'layered' approach to protecting their vehicles from thieves. 1.) Nissan Altima - 810 . 2.) Ford Fusion - 793 . 3.) Ford F-150 - 775 . 4.) Toyota Corolla - 66 . 5.) Chevrolet Impala - 654 . 6.) Hyundai Elantra - 541 . 7.) Dodge Charger - 536 . 8.) Chevrolet Malibu - 529 . 9.) Chevrolet Cruze - 499 . 10.) Ford Focus - 483 . There are everyday precautions such as properly locking the car and never leaving the windows or sunroofs down. Also, always park in the garage and not on the street. When parking away from home, try and choose areas that are populous and well-lit. The NCIB also recommends an antitheft device, even as simple as a steering wheel lock. Thieves attempt to make off with a car as fast as possible, so small things that will delay them could force them to flee. Another good deterrent is a hidden ignition kill switch. It's also suggested that the car or . truck's vehicle identification number (VIN, often found on the driver's . side of the dashboard) is etched onto major components, to stop the . vehicle from being stripped. The National Insurance Crime Board suggests simple methods to protect your car from thieves, such as steering wheel locks and installing a kill switch . 'The drop in thefts is good news for all of us,' NICB president and CEO Joe Wehrle told Forbes. 'But it still amounts to a vehicle being stolen every 45 seconds and losses of over $4 billion a year. 'That’s why we applaud the vehicle manufacturers for their efforts to improve anti–theft technology and pledge to continue to work with our insurance company members and law enforcement to identify and seek vigorous prosecution of the organized criminal rings responsible for so many of these thefts.'","List was compiled by the National Insurance Crime Board (NCIB)

"The British teenager suspected of shooting dead a Florida police officer had recently been thrown out of her home by her parents after rows over her boyfriend and her arrest on drug offenses. Alexandria Hollinghurst and her boyfriend Brandon Goode gunned down a police officer in a wealthy suburb of Orlando on Saturday before apparently taking their own lives. Authorities said the teenagers had both left behind suicide notes. The tragedy came after 17-year-old Hollinghurst, who was born in the north of England, moved in with Goode, 18, after her parents Matthew and Debra objected to his 'druggie' lifestyle. Police records also reveal he had threatened his mother with an axe when he was just 16. 'Suicide': Brandon Goode, left, and his . girlfriend, Alex . Hollinghurst, right, left suicide notes before gunning down a Florida . police officer on Saturday morning before apparently taking their own . lives . Tragedy: Alex Hollinghurst died early Saturday - but police could have had an opportunity to stop her and Goode when they encountered them at a Walgreens pharmacy in Florida 24-hours before they allegedly died . Last . month, she was arrested with him after they were found to be in . possession of marijuana but as she is a juvenile, details of her court . appearance are not for public record. Her . name was redacted from the arrest report, but a police source confirmed . she was the 17-year-old girl who was arrested with Goode on February . 24th was Hollinghurst. It was this incident that led to Hollinghurst moving out of her parent's home in Davenport, Florida. Gunned down: Officer Robert German called for backup and was found fatally injured in the road . 'Matthew . and Debra tried to stop Alex from seeing this guy and they just kept on . rowing,' said a friend. 'The arrest last month was the final straw for . them, and she moved out after rowing all the time. She was coming home . at all hours.' Friends . of Hollinghurst said her parents, who emigrated from Manchester in . 2011, disapproved of Goode who was previously arrested for aggravated . assault when he threatened his mum with an axe. In the 2012 incident, he had painted his face black, covered the windows of his home, armed himself with an axe and when his mother returned home, he demanded she accept his father's divorce settlement, the Orlando Sentinel reported. 'Alex . had moved into Brandon's home because her parents threw her out,' said a . friend who attended the same high school as the teenagers. They did not like Brandon because he was involved in drugs and made no secret that he liked to smoke weed.' Neighbors of Goode, who lived with his divorced mum Connie, confirmed that they often saw blonde Alex at the home. 'She . was here all the time, and a cute girl,' said neighbor George Koop. 'They would go out together in his car, often coming back late at . night.' On Monday, it emerged that the teenagers had been reported as being 'missing endangered' after two separate notes were found by their families. Roped off: Officers cordoned off the area where the shootings are said to have taken place . Scene: A medical examiner's van can be seen in the neighborhood following the shootings on Saturday . Scene: A body is taken away in a medical examiner's van following the shootings on Saturday . As . police only recovered one weapon it would seem the teenagers took it in turns to shoot . themselves as part of a suicide pact. Their bodies were found 100 yards from where officer Robert German was gunned down. They apparently shot him after he stopped them during a routine foot patrol through the neighborhood. A police spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office said: 'The OSCO has been given suicide notes written by both individuals. The contents of those notes will not be revealed at this time, as the investigation is active and open. 'During the course of this homicide investigation, the OSCO investigations learned from Polk County authorities, that the suspects were considered missing endangered due to the suicidal notes. 'That information was entered by Polk County into the system.' Mystery: Police say they found a male and female, both white and in their early 20s, dead in brush on the property of this home - they are believed to have committed suicide . Police also revealed that they have found Goode's car in a parking lot more than 20 miles away in Kissimmee. The statement added: 'Goode and Hollinghurst are now officially considered suspects in the homicide of Officer Robert German.' The . discovery of the notes has led to speculation that the pair had been . considering 'suicide by cop' and set out to provoke the officer into . opening fire on them. It . is not known why they shot German before he had a chance to use his . service revolver or why they did not wait for other officers to arrive . before taking their own lives. German . had called for back-up telling his radio dispatchers to say he was . stopping the pair for suspicious activity. But when a patrol car arrived . they found German shot in the head. The officers then heard two gunshots and the bodies of Goode and Hollinghurst were found in bushes about 100 yards away. Devastated: Hollinghurst's younger sister's Facebook profile is filled with images of the two girls smiling and making silly faces . Cut short: Hollinghurst had a seemingly bright future, she graduated high school an entire year early . The . slain officer was wearing a body camera at the time and the footage . will be reviewed as part of the investigation into the incident. Attempts to resuscitate him were . unsuccessful, he was soon pronounced dead at Orlando Regional Medical . Center, authorities said. Hollinghurst . originally came from Oldham in Greater Manchester, England and her . family had emigrated to the U.S. about six years ago. Former neighbors . have spoken of their shock. Locals . in the village of Hadfield, Derbyshire, said Alexandria has a sister, . Hannah, who is two or three years younger, and an older stepsister, . Georgia, who is about 25 or 26 but did not live with the family. The girls' parents were known as Tom and Debra Jane, or just Jane. The . current occupant of their old house, an end-terrace, said the property . was re-possessed, then the family moved to the US, with letters arriving . for them always addressed to Tom or Jane. Popular: Hollinghurst's Facebook is also chock full of pictures of her with friends . The . woman, who did not wish to be named, said Mr Hollinghurst was involved . in a concrete or building business before they emigrated and added: 'I'm . really shocked, I hadn't heard anything about this.' Another neighbour was visibly shaken, saying: 'I'm too shocked to talk at the moment. I can't believe what's happened.' Andrew . Cartledge, headteacher of St Andrew's C.E Junior School, in Hadfield, . Derbyshire, paid tribute to Alex. He told ITV News: 'She was with us . until the age of 11. 'She was an able pupil, sociable, with a lot of friends. Our thoughts are with her and her family.' Grace Etchells, who went to primary school with Alex also paid tribute to her on Twitter. She . wrote: 'So horrible knowing a very close friend from primary Alex . Hollinghurst sadly got taken from us in such horrific circumstances. RIP . lovely xx.' Solemn remembrance: An individual is shown Saturday bringing flowers to the Windermere Police Department . Piecing it together: An investigator is shown Saturday taking a picture of a handgun recovered from the scene, it is not yet known whose firearm it is . Hollinghurst's family and friends insist on social media that she was murdered, that her death was not a suicide. 'I . have friends whose daughter was murdered this morning in Florida,' a . family friend wrote on Facebook. 'She was only 17... they think her . boyfriend killed her.' German . came across the pair while conducting foot patrols Saturday morning, in . the same exclusive gated community that Tiger Woods and ex-wife Elin . Nordegren previously had a home. Several . people have expressed overwhelming sadness over the death of one of . only 12 full time officers in the town of about 2,000. 'Windermere's heart is broken,' said Mayor Gary Bruhn. 'Robbie . was one of the greatest men I have ever known,' Tara Boers wrote on a . Facebook page dedicated to German. 'He loved being a police officer even . knowing the risks involved. My daughter and I feel such loss today and . will love him forever.' A terrible loss: Tara Boers (right) wrote on Facebook that German (left) was the 'greatest' man she's ever known, and that she and her daughter 'will love him forever' A childhood neighbor of the fallen officer told WFTV he was . shocked to hear German had been shot to death. 'Officer . German was a good cop, he was one of the finest police officers that we . had in this agency,' said Ogden, adding he had just returned to foot . patrols this week after months behind a desk while rehabbing after . shoulder surgery. 'This is such a nice safe area,' a local told News 13. 'It is unbelievable that this would happen.' Several other people told local media the incident was shocking, and a terrible tragedy. Police . Chief David Ogden echoed that sentiment, noting: 'Our hearts, thoughts, . and prayers are with Officer German's family during this difficult . time.' German attended . Lake Mary High School, then studied at the Seminole State College police . academy. He is survived by his mother and father.","Police Officer Robert German, 31, was shot dead on Saturday morning after coming across teenage couple while on foot patrol in Orlando suburb .

"They're a group of enthusiastic young girls who have always wanted to be cheerleaders but, due to assorted medical ailments, would never actually qualify for a proper team. But now they have their own. A gym in Tyler, Texas, is offering a creative new charity program for kids in the area by forming a special needs cheerleading squad, according to KETK. Their name? Team Inspire. Team Inspire: The new cheer squad, formed for children with special needs at the Gym Tyler in Texas, watch on as another squad performs . Active: At the moment the team is made up of about 15 enthusiastic girls, but boys are welcome too . Open arms: Everyone is welcome to join the team . Branchild: The owner of GymTyler Gymnastics, Kim Johnson (left), came up with the idea for Team Inspire, saying that special needs kids deserved cheerleading programs too . Alot of people have got involved to help the children learn the cheer routine . 'I am excited': Ava Penkilo, 8, is one of the girl's on Team Inspire . Motivated:  Team Inspire, a group of cheerleaders with special needs, will start practice at Johnson's gym in September. So far, about 15 cheerleaders are interested in the program . The owner of GymTyler Gymnastics, Kim Johnson, said the idea came about in February, when a one-off squad was created for the developmentally challenged. The team performed a two and a half minute routine at a University of Texas at Tyler basketball game. 'It was so awesome and overwhelming,' Johnson told the Tyler Morning Telegraph. 'I really think God reached down and said, ''this is what we are doing''.' Johnson then set out on a fundraising effort in order to collect enough money so the squad could become a permanent part of her gym. While raising a cheerleader will usually set parents back anywhere between $1,500 to $5,000 a year, the cost to join the Team Inspire is $15 a month. Cheering: The cost for the children joining Team Inspire will be just $15 per month following a fundraiser . Ready, ok: Gym owner Kim Johnson (back left) said she wanted to launch the cheer program for years .

"A trio of advisers to the president warned a congressional committee on Wednesday that Al Qaeda and the Islamic State are competing against each other to be the dominant terrorist group and that rivalry could lead to an attack on the U.S. Responding to a question from GOP Rep. Peter King, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, and National Counterterrorism Center Director Matthew Olsen expressed concern over the tug-of-war and acceded that Al Qaeda may be trying to reassert itself as the leading global terrorist network. 'These groups are in competition with one another for attention, for fundraising, for recruitment, and one way to compete is to show that you're the biggest and baddest group out there,' Johnson told members of the House Homeland Security Committee. 'The logic of it is compelling,' Comey concurred. 'You're not going to be the leader in the global jihad without striking America.' U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, center, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) James Comey, left, and Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Matthew Olsen, right, appeared before the House Homeland Security Committee today to update members on 'Worldwide Threats to the Homeland' Olsen said the recent announcement by Al Qaeda of a new affiliate in India could be interpreted as an indication that it's trying to reaffirm its supremacy. Al Qaeda and ISIS were once a part of the terrorist group in Iraq but the two groups parted ways earlier this year as the Islamic State's tactics became increasingly barbaric. Since then, Al Qaeda has denied any affiliation between their group and ISIS. They are now in 'what appears to be a competition' to 'see who is the true heir apparent to [Osama] Bin Laden,' Homeland Security Committee chairman Mike McCaul told his colleagues during today's hearing. 'It's a dangerous competition. And the way I see it, is to up the ante, what better way to do that than to attack the West,' he expounded. McCaul said in a statement at the start of the hearing that the U.S. needs to only only rollback ISIS in Iraq, it needs to 'destroy them wherever they emerge' lest they grow to become an even greater threat to the U.S. 'Let us be clear, our nation is at war with this group and the twisted ideology it is seeking to spread,' he said. And 'if we do not take the fight to the enemy oversees, we risk having to fight them here at home.' The Texas Republican's comments came as new evidence of ISIS' designs on the U.S. emerged online. A Hollywood-style film trailer released by ISIS on Tuesday that claims to be a preview of what is 'coming soon' suggests the terrorist group may attack the White House if the president enlists American combat troops to fight alongside the Iraqi army. While the the 52-second video, which has since been removed by YouTube, does not explicitly name the White House as a target, footage of the the president's quarters alludes to the group's intentions. In a speech to servicemen and women at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, this afternoon, President Barack Obama admonished the extremist group and promised that the U.S. would hunt down and destroy them. 'Whether in Iraq or in Syria,' the president said, 'these terrorists will learn the same thing that leaders of al-Qaeda already know: We mean what we say.' 'Our reach is long. If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. We will find you eventually,' he added. Ominous: A new ISIS video, which has since been taken down by YouTube, includes a brief and shaky clip of the White House as a car drives past - clearly threatening the home of the U.S. president . New York City police officers stand guard in Times Square on Wednesday after a blog affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) mentioned the iconic city center as a target for bombing . President Obama admonished ISIS this afternoon and promised the group that 'If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. We will find you eventually' The United States intelligence community believes that ISIS has now convinced as many as 30,000 people, including 15,000 foreigners, to join its missions in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon estimates that 100 Americans have also joined ISIS' ranks, and U.S. officials fear that they could return home and commit acts of terrorism. During today's Homeland Security hearing McCaul pressed the Obama administration officials on their level of 'confidence' that the government capturing Americans aligned with ISIS. 'We have a reasonable degree of confidence, not a high degree of confidence...that we know the numbers and who is attempting to travel,' Johnson told him. Comey explained that his agency spends its whole day 'sorting among that group to find the bad guys' and that it is able to jail many of them before they leave the country or as they attempt to come back. But given the nature of the group, Comey said, he's not 'over confident' about their ability to catch each and every one of them. The FBI chief assured McCaul that agents scour the internet looking for people who have been radicalized, however, 'in a country this big and this free,' he said, it's sometimes difficult to arrest people before they've committed a crime. And while the FBI is 'interested' in suspending the passports of suspected would be terrorists like the British government, Comey later said, that may be a violation of due process rights. Members of Congress have also voiced angst over the possibility of jihadists sneaking into the U.S. through its porous border with Mexico. Johnson and other members of Obama's cabinet have repeatedly stated that they've seen no evidence of an imminent threat from ISIS at home or abroad. 'Having said that, we do need to be vigilant,' Johnson said today. 'We do need to be aware of the risk of potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group.'","Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a congressional committee 'one way to compete is to show that you're the biggest and baddest group'

"The United States' top military general said Wednesday that half of the Iraqi army is incapable of putting their sectarian differences aside to fight off the Islamic State. Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters travelling with him on a trip to Paris that 24 of the Iraqi army's 50 brigades were too heavily comprised of Shiites to effectively work together with other religious sects to combat  ISIS. U.S. military assessors who spent the summer in Iraq found that the other 26 brigades could partner with the U.S., but they would need additional training and equipment, Dempsey said, according to the Associated Press. Scroll down for video . Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey, pictured here testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday, told reporters traveling with him to Paris on Wednesday that half of the Iraqi army won't fight ISIS . Dempsey's admission to reporters today follows testimony he gave to a Senate committee on Tuesday indicating that he would consider advising the president to put boots on the ground in Iraq if the United States' strategy to form a broad international coalition against ISIS fails to ward off ISIS. President Barack Obama has unequivocally ruled out ground troops in Iraq in numerous public statements, but Dempsey revealed to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the president told him privately 'to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.' Dempsey told the senators that U.S. forces could engage in 'close combat advising' if the circumstances called for it. While making it clear he was speaking hypothetically, Dempsey suggested that American troops could find themselves 'accompanying' Iraqi troops on a mission to retake the city of Mosul, for example. The general's affirmation that the president may have to send U.S. troops on a combat mission  after all was panned as an about-face by the White House and the first step towards the 'mission creep' that dovish Democrats had been nervous about all along. The White House rushed to reiterate that Dempsey was not foreshadowing military action and was merely explaining how he would advise the president in a hypothetical scenario. But on Wednesday Dempsey again alluded to boots on the ground while speaking with reporters about the situation in Iraq. Dempsey repeated the administration's claims that only Iraqis, working together, could save their country from the hands of ISIS and no amount of U.S. military might would be able to do that for them. Iraq must form an inclusive government that represents the three major religious sects in the county if it wants to defeat the Islamic State, he said. And then, according to Fox News, Dempsey added, 'I'm telling you, if that doesn't happen then it's time for Plan B.' Progressive activist group CodePink, known for its anti-war protests, showed up at the hearing Dempsey was testifying at on Tuesday to show its opposition to boots on the ground in Iraq. Dempsey indicated on Tuesday that the U.S. could shift forces into combat roles in Iraq if the circumstances called for it . The general also theorized that the Iraqi government may be willing to revisit its decision not to give the U.S. military legal immunity in the country if the President Obama agrees to send troops to Iraq to train its army. 'There will likely be a discussion with the new Iraqi government, as there was with the last one, about whether we need to have' them approve a U.S. military presence in the country, Dempsey said. The Iraqi government's refusal to sign a status of forces agreement granting the U.S. army immunity after the conclusion of the Iraq war led to a withdraw of American troops in 2011. A vocal group of Republican lawmakers, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, the ranking member of the Senate's Armed Services committee, have claimed that if the U.S. had left a residual number of troops in the country at that time, Iraq would not be in the quagmire it is today. Dempsey was in France today meeting with his foreign counterpart there as President Obama was in Tampa, Florida, to receive a briefing on the campaign to roll back ISIS. Obama will meet with U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Lloyd Austin during his trip, as well as other CENTCOM commanders. CENTCOM oversees military operations in the Middle East, including Iraq and Syria. According to the White House Obama will take time to speak with other service members working to implement his strategy in Iraq to thank them for their hard work.","General Martin Dempsey told reporters on Wednesday that 24 of the Iraqi army's 50 brigades were not fit to battle ISIS .
