"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ap . Just as Arthur Sulzberger Jr. comes out swinging against accusations former executive editor Jill Abramson was paid less than her male predecessor, Abramson is using her free time to throw punches of her own, with a new hobby: boxing. The axed editor's daughter Cornelia posted an Instagram photo Thursday afternoon showing her mom wearing gloves and smirking at a boxing bag with the message, 'Mom's badass new hobby.' With the message were the hashtags '#girls' and '#pushy,' presumably in reference to rumors Abramson was fired for demanding more money after learning the previous, and male, editor made far more. Scroll down for Sulzberger's full statement... #pushy: Recently canned New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson is using her newly discovered free time to take up boxing...and to fuel rumors she was fired for being #pushy with this Instagram photo posted by her daughter . Pushback: NYT publisher Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. has already swung back with a Thursday memo to employees that said not only was Abramson not paid less than her male predecessor, but was compensated more . Meanwhile, Sulzberger said in a Thursday staff memo that those reports are completely untrue. 'It is simply not true that Jill’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors,' he wrote in the memo, obtained by Politico. 'Her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors.' Sulzberger attributed Abramson's termination in his Wednesday announcement to the New York Times newsroom to 'an issue with management in the newsroom.' The publisher said in his memo that he wanted to 'set the record straight' about 'misinformation' regarding Abramson's salary. In fact, Sulzberger claims she made even more than the man she replaced. 'In 2013, her last full year in the role, her total compensation package was more than 10% higher than that of her predecessor, Bill Keller, in his last full year as Executive Editor, which was 2010,' he wrote. 'It was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year.' The Times announced the abrupt management change on Wednesday, but didn't give a reason, which prompted a flurry of speculation in media circles. In a blog post, New Yorker staff writer Ken Auletta quoted an anonymous 'close associate' who said Abramson confronted the Times' 'top brass' about her pay after discovering that both her pay and her pension benefits were less than that of her male predecessor, Bill Keller. The confrontation, Auletta wrote, 'may have fed into the management's narrative that she was ""pushy.""' In Thursday's memo, Sulzberger said that the only reason behind his decision to dismiss Abrams was 'concerns I had about some aspects of Jill's management of our newsroom, which I had previously made clear to her, both face-to-face and in my annual assessment.' Abramson, 60, was the paper's first female executive editor. She joined the newspaper in 1997 after working for nearly a decade at The Wall Street Journal. She was the Times' Washington editor and bureau chief before being named managing editor in 2003. Memo from Arthur Sulzberger Jr. obtained by POLITICO . Dear Colleagues, . I am writing to you because I am concerned about the misinformation that has been widely circulating in the media since I announced Jill Abramson’s departure yesterday.  I particularly want to set the record straight about Jill’s pay as Executive Editor of The Times. It is simply not true that Jill’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors.  Her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors.  In fact, in 2013, her last full year in the role, her total compensation package was more than 10% higher than that of her predecessor, Bill Keller, in his last full year as Executive Editor, which was 2010.  It was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year. Comparisons between the pensions of different executive editors are difficult for several reasons.  Pensions are based upon years of service with the Company.  Jill’s years of service were significantly fewer than those of many of her predecessors.  Secondly, as you may know, pension plans for all managers at The New York Times were frozen in 2009.  But this and all other pension changes at the Company have been applied without any gender bias and Jill was not singled out or differentially disadvantaged in any way. Compensation played no part whatsoever in my decision that Jill could not remain as executive editor. Nor did any discussion about compensation.  The reason — the only reason — for that decision was concerns I had about some aspects of Jill’s management of our newsroom, which I had previously made clear to her, both face-to-face and in my annual assessment. This Company is fully committed to equal treatment of all its employees, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation or any other characteristic. We are working hard to live up to that principle in every part of our organization.  I am satisfied that we fully lived up to that commitment with regard to Jill.

"By . Jill Reilly . Barry Selby, 50, was tortured and burnt to death with sulphuric acid in a revenge killing . An innocent father of three was tortured and burnt to death with sulphuric acid in a revenge killing after his son was caught up in a gangland feud. Barry Selby, 50, was confronted at 2am by an armed gang who burst into his bedroom and shot him in the legs to incapacitate him. As he lay on the floor they then poured the corrosive liquid over his body from head to foot while his terrified wife Donna hid behind their bed. Mrs Selby was forced to listen in horror as her husband cried out in agony as the acid burned through his flesh caused him 50 per cent burns. He fought for his life for four days before he succumbed to organ failure caused by the stress of his injuries. Police who investigated the savage killing discovered Mr Selby’s son Liam had been involved in a bust up with other people on their council estate. The killers had sworn vengeance on Liam by turning up at his family home in Bradford, West Yorkshire to kneecap and kill his father. Lee Calvert, 23, Joseph Lowther, 22, Robert Woodhead, 28, and Andrew Feather, 23 were convicted of murder at Bradford Crown Court on Thursday. Ringleader Calvert, punched one security guard to the floor and fought with another as the jury returned its guilty verdicts. He had to be wrestled to the ground by three dock officers and led away to the cells by the scruff of his neck. The court heard how the killing arose out of a string tit-for-tat incidents between two groups of men on the Holme Wood estate. Mrs Selby was forced to listen in horror as her husband cried out in agony as the acid burned through his flesh caused him 50 per cent burns. Lee Calvert, 23,  left and Joseph Lowther, 22,  right were convicted of murder . The father of three fought for his life for four days before he succumbed to organ failure caused by the stress of his injuries. Robert Woodhead, 28, right, and Andrew Feather, 23, left,  were also convicted of murder . Liam was said to be a member of the one of the gangs and Calvert and his friends from the other. In the hours before the murder on October 14 last year Calvert’s gang all wearing balaclava masks and armed with guns, got out of a black Mitsubishi and fired shots at the front door and windows of a house belonging to Liam’s friends. Then at 2am the same group drew up outside Liam’s family home smashed open the front door and stormed upstairs where his parents were in bed. Mr Selby awoken by the noise of the front door being broken down told his wife to 'stay out of the way' and she crouched down between her bed and the wall as he went to face the gang alone. He tried to prevent his attackers coming in, but the bedroom door was forced open and Mrs Selby heard her husband shout: 'Get out,' and then heard him being beaten up and crying out in pain. The gang shot Mr Selby in the left leg, with the bullet going through the left leg and into the right leg, before spraying him with acid . Mrs Selby told the court: 'He cried out, then it all went quiet and I raised my head to look around the bedroom. The killers had sworn vengeance on Liam by turning up at his family home  (general street view) in Bradford, West Yorkshire to kneecap and kill his father . 'He was lying on the floor and one of the intruders was standing over him.' The court heard one of the gang also stormed into the bedroom of Mr Selby’s 19-year-old daughter, Jade, and threw a liquid at her but it did not make contact. The gang then fled. Paramedics arrived at the scene to find a bewildered Mr Selby lying on the floor with acid burns to the back of his scalp, neck, back, the back of his thighs and the back of his right lower leg. He was taken to Leeds General Infirmary but then transferred to a specialist unit at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield, with 50 per cent acid burns. He had surgery on two occasions and initially there was an improvement in his condition, but then he deteriorated and died. Mr Simon Myerson QC prosecuting said: 'The manner of Mr Selby's death was shocking and upsetting. 'What these men had done is to shoot Barry Selby in the left leg. It was a kneecapping. They then doused his back from head to foot with acid. 'Police and paramedics who attended noticed a haze and a strong sulphurous smell and were themselves affected by the fumes. 'Mr Selby was covered in what looked like brown paint that paramedics correctly believed was acid. Unfortunately, without knowing the type of acid, the paramedics were unable to wash it away and just had to watch as it burned into Mr Selby's back.' 'The flesh from his neck, back, arms and legs had been burned away. Mr Selby's system was simply unable to cope with the stress to which it was subjected, his heart and kidneys were affected and he died.' All were jailed for life at Bradford Crown Court.  Calvert must serve a minimum of 36 years, Lowther and Woodhead 32 years each, and Feather 26 . Calvert was later arrested and confessed to the killing to a fellow inmate whilst awaiting trial. He denied murder but was convicted after a six week trial. Joseph Lowther, 22, Robert Woodhead, 28, and Andrew Feather, 23, were also convicted of murder. Calvert, Lowther and Woodhead were further convicted of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. All were jailed for life. Calvert must serve a minimum of 36 years, Lowther and Woodhead 32 years each, and Feather 26. Det Ch Insp Nick Wallen of West Yorks Police said after the case that officers had never seen the use of acid in such circumstances and with such 'devastating consequences'. He added: 'These men broke into an innocent man's home when he was asleep, viciously assaulted him and doused him with acid. It was a sickening and cowardly attack on Barry Selby and sadly led to his untimely death just a few days later. 'Barry was a much loved husband, father and grandfather and is sadly missed by family and friends. The defendants have not given evidence and have never offered an explanation for what they did, but they are, without doubt, very dangerous and evil men. 'The lengthy sentences passed down today clearly reflect the seriousness of their actions and are welcomed by the team of police officers and staff who have worked on this investigation. I would also like to thank those who gave evidence for showing great courage in coming forward.' A statement from Mr Selby's family, said: 'We are extremely happy with the outcome of the trial and the verdict has shown us that justice has been served. We would like to say thank you to our close family and friends for their support throughout what has been a traumatic time. We would also like to thank the police family liaison officers for the support they have provided over the past months.We now feel as a family that we have some closure and can start to move forward with our lives.'","Barry Selby, 50, was confronted at 2am by an armed gang .

Lisbon: The heart specialist and his wife have accused the former Portuguese policeman of libelling them . Gerry McCann, left, has flown to Portugal to join his wife Kate in the £1million libel case they brought against former police chief Goncalo Amaral, who published a book about Maddie's disappearance . Quoted in The Star, Mr Mitchell said last night: 'I can confirm Gerry McCann is hoping to give evidence.' In his 2008 bombshell book, 'The Truth of Lies', Amaral claimed that Kate and Gerry McCann hid their daughter's body after a . fatal accident at the family's Algarve holiday apartment. He said they . staged her disappearance to cover up their negligence – accusations the . McCanns vehemently deny. The couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, . launched £1million libel proceedings against Mr Amaral, who was sacked . as the head of the investigation after he launched an outspoken attack . on British police. They are also suing his book publishers and a TV station which broadcast an April 2009 documentary repeating Mr Amaral's claims. The . trial, which began earlier this month at Lisbon's civil court, has . heard that Mrs McCann told friends she was ‘devastated’ by Amaral's . book. Their friend Susan Hubbard, the wife of an Anglican minister . who counselled the McCanns after Madeleine’s disappearance from a . holiday resort in Praia da Luz, told the court: ‘The thought that most . people in Portugal thought Madeleine was dead was devastating for both . Kate and Gerry – and the thought that was added, that they had something . to do with it.’ Defamed?

Mrs McCann, a GP, cried as the court heard she was . unable to eat and constantly wept in the days after Madeleine’s . disappearance on May 3, 2007. But Mrs Hubbard, 46, said Mrs McCann’s . despair turned to ‘anger and surprise’ after the couple were named as . arguidos – or suspects – by the Portuguese police. Mr Amaral’s book, . The Truth Of The Lie, was published three days after the Portuguese . authorities formally closed the investigation in 2008 and cleared the . couple as suspects. The McCanns’ lawyer, Isabel Duarte, said it also contained claims that the family’s ‘Find Madeleine’ fund could be fraudulent. The . fund raised £2million in public donations and was used to pay for the . search for Madeleine to continue after the Portuguese case was closed. A . private detective who worked for the fund said he received abuse . instead of information after Mr Amaral’s book soured public opinion . against the McCanns. Skipton, Yorkshire, said the McCanns viewed Mr . Amaral's book as a 'gross breach of confidentiality' because it showed . he had been speaking to publishers while he and colleagues claimed laws . on secrecy prevented them from discussing the Madeleine case with the . couple. The trial has also heard from Alan Pike, a trauma expert who . has been helping the McCanns since Madeleine's May 3 2007 disappearance . on the Algarve. The told the court last week that Mrs McCann .

'On one of the Internet forums, called The 3 Arguidos, . there was an Internet conversation in great length where a member was . suggesting that someone should abduct Sean or Amelie because they may be . able to get information out of them that would confirm Mr Amaral's . theories.'

Madeleine for the couple, said he felt compelled to tell Gerry and he . was interviewed by police from his home county of North Yorkshire after . they decided detectives should be alerted. Crime scene: The Ocean Club Resort in Praia da Luz where Madeleine went missing in 2007 . He said the threats also made Gerry and Kate more vigilant about the use of the Internet by their twins, now eight.

"By . Jill Reilly . This is the shocking moment a pair of drug addicts slumped on the floor of a public toilet after taking legal highs. The two addicts had injected themselves just yards from a popular park full of adults and children at lunchtime. The pair are thought to have bought the legal highs from a nearby shop before going into the toilet in broad daylight for a fix. When police arrived one of the men came around while it took around ten minutes to wake the other from his drug-fuelled daze. Scroll down for video . This is the shocking moment a pair of junkies slumped on the floor of a public toilet after taking legal highs . No arrests were made because the men were not in possession of any illegal substances. The incident took place around 2pm one Monday next to Castle Green in Taunton, Somerset and just metres from the plush Castle Hotel. Avon and Somerset police condemned the druggies' behaviour and said they feared it was only a matter of time before a child pricked themselves on one of their discarded needles. Acting Inspector Neil Kimmins said: 'The public who pay their taxes shouldn't have this experience coming into Taunton. Legal highs have seen an 'unprecedented expansion' in Britain in recent years - with one in ten people in Britain now admitting they have tried the drugs. New types of the dangerous drugs are being detected at the rate of two a week, a report has found. And the unprecedented rise in the number of potentially toxic new chemicals has left police and drug agencies in the UK struggling to keep up. The UN's Global Synthetic Drugs Assessment report said 348 legal highs have been identified across the globe, with 97 new substances detected last year alone - up from 8 new ones a year earlier. Legal highs are designed to imitate the effects of Class A drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy while having enough differences in their chemical make-up to get around existing bans. Many new drugs are created in back-street laboratories in the Far East and are marketed as plant food or bath salts to try to skirt the law. Police cannot stop their sale in shops or at festivals because they are not prohibited. Users of so-called designer drugs were warned that they are playing 'Russian Roulette' with their lives after a huge surge in the number of deaths. Doctors and nurses in Britain have been left 'powerless' to treat casualties when they fall ill because they are unable to identify what substances they have taken so cannot provide appropriate medical care. 'It's not right that people in that lovely area sit down to have their lunch and before they leave go into the toilets to see this. 'Our fear is that if people are injecting in public toilets in broad daylight, then children could go into the toilets, pick up a used needle and accidentally stab themselves. I can see it's only a matter of time.' The number one shop for selling legal highs in Taunton is Hush, which is part of a chain of three stores in the Westcountry. On its website, the company describes itself as 'biggest and best selling Head Shops in the South West'. There is no law against Hush selling legal highs - providing it is not suggested they are for human consumption. But the firm has been shrouded in controversy in recent years. Simon Tomlin and Paris Newton, the owners, were ordered to pay more than £210,000 in fines, costs and confiscation orders last year after admitting having banned substances at their shops. It is unknown whether the drug users photographed on the floor of the public toilets had bought their legal highs from Hush. But one officer, from Avon and Somerset Police, has said he believes most of the town's 20 - 30 regular legal high users buy their product at the store. No one was from Hush was available to comment today. People can't be prosecuted for purchasing 'legal highs', which are often advertised as plant food and 'not for human consumption'. The latest official UK figures show 68 deaths were linked to legal highs in 2012, up from 10 in 2009 . A recent report from The United Nations showed there were now 348 types of legal highs - an increase of 100 in the last year. The . centre of Taunton. Avon and Somerset police condemned the pair's . behaviour and said they feared it was only a matter of time before a . child pricked themselves on one of their discarded needles . David Raynes, a spokesperson for the National Drug Prevention Alliance, yesterday blamed the government's lack of action for the rise in the use of legal highs. He said: 'Shops on high streets have been banned in Portugal, Poland and Ireland so why not in the UK? 'They might be billed as bath salts or plant food but we all know what they are sold for. 'Lots of the substances aren't suitable for consumption, but the shop owners don't care, they are just in it to make money. 'We have campaigned against new psychoactive substances (legal highs) but the government is just sitting on its hands. It is paralysis by analysis. 'I question why these shops are allowed to be open on a High Street and why they can't just be banned.' Police in Taunton have been on a drug offensive after several problems in the area were linked to illegal drugs and legal highs. In order to combat the rising problem, Avon and Somerset Police launched Operation Cortez and stepped up their efforts after multiple drug dealers were jailed and begging in the area was linked to drugs. Earlier this month, a top detective in the area, Detective Inspector Ray Hulin, claimed that legal high shops were “a disgrace”. The number one shop for selling legal highs in Taunton is Hush, which is part of a chain of three stores in the Westcountry. On its website, the company describes itself as 'biggest and best selling Head Shops in the South West' The comments came after the legal high shop, Hush, was linked to the death of a fully functioning man who took the legal high Green Goblins and proceeded to repeatedly bang his head against a wall. This followed on from a rise in begging and anti-social behaviour throughout the area that were linked to the substances. Police, using Operation Gratuity, were urging people not to give money beggars, as rather than spending the money on food or shelter, they were purchasing legal highs. Speaking at the time, Taunton Town Centre team's Sgt Neil Kimmins said the operation isn't targeting the vulnerable. He added: 'Our intelligence suggests a minority of people have become dependent on alcohol and the latest legal high drugs for a number of reasons. 'In a minority of cases, they resort to begging to raise money to pay for these items. 'While organisations such as TAH provide support and housing for those who find themselves homeless and suffering with related health issues, not all people necessarily wish to engage with them. 'To disrupt and act in an anti-social manner in the town centre isn't acceptable and won't be tolerated.' Several people have also been jailed over several months following drug offences. Alan Murphy was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and two counts of possession with intent to supply Class  drugs in Taunton. The court also ordered him had to pay back £1,497.56. Operation Cortez also had similar success in the area, catching two people red handed of drug dealing. First was Shane Barrett, of Laverock Court,Taunton, who was caught dealing class A drugs such as Cocaine outside a drug rehabilitation centre. The 43-year-old was jailed for five years on March 3rd after he admitted six counts of supplying class A drugs. Nicholas Milton, 47, of Cheddon Road, Taunton, was also caught out by Operation Cortez. He admitted supplying Class A drugs, possession of Class A and possession of Class B and was at Taunton Crown Court on Monday. Milton was given a two-year community order with drug rehabilitation requirement and ordered to pay £250 costs and £60 surcharge.","The pair were slumped on the floor of a public toilet in Taunton, Somerset .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Internet trolls fuelled by an ex police chief's claims about the McCanns incited conspiracy-theorists to plot to kidnap the couple's twins Sean and Amelie, a court heard today. Goncalo Amaral's claims they faked daughter Madeleine's abduction to cover up her death in their Algarve holiday apartment was to blame for the threats, close family friend Michael Wright said.

Mr Amaral's book was published just three days after the McCanns - made suspects over their daughter's death in September 2007 - had their status as 'arguidos' formally lifted. Around 120,000 copies of the book were sold before it was withdrawn when the McCanns won an injunction against him. It formed the basis for a documentary screened on TVI - the Portuguese equivalent of ITV - in April 2009. Company director Mr Wright, from Skipton, North Yorks, said Gerry had suffered one of his darkest hours when they marked the second anniversary of Madeleine's May 3 2007 disappearance together in a remote cottage. The couple were told on the way to the cottage locals on the Algarve were ripping up posters they had put up as part of a campaign to find their daughter. He told the court: 'I had a discussion with Gerry where he talked about not being able to go on.

He said Kate, who flew to Lisbon last week for the start of the libel trial, changed whenever she was in Portugal where she felt most people believed Mr Amaral's theories. 'She feels she can't be seen to smile,' he told the court. 'Almost any form of relaxation is a problem, she wouldn't even go to the gym on her own, because there's still a belief most people in Portugal think she and Gerry are responsible for killing Madeleine.

Revealing he had received an email informing him Mr Amaral had asked for £67,000 for an interview with Channel 5 in September 2009, he added: 'Kate's reaction was this was confirmation this was not about justice or truth. 'This was about greed.' Amaral, 56, is denying defamation. He insists everything he published in his book is already contained in police and court case files on Madeleine which have been made public - an argument disputed by the McCanns.

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ap . Still smiling? An upstate New York school board president stepped down Tuesday after he was caught calling a parent 'chubby wubby' on an open mic last night during a board meeting . A New York school board president who described a PTA parent as 'chubby wubby' during a public meeting has resigned. Ray Cote's resignation was announced at a Mahopac Board of Education meeting Tuesday night, where parents had vowed to demand he step down regardless of whether he apologized. He did so, nonetheless. Cote called words his 'inappropriate' and said they 'do not reflect my feelings or attitudes.' The school district's attorney says Cote also withdrew his candidacy for re-election. Parents of school children in the tiny New York State hamlet immediately called for Cote, who's led the board since 2011, after his comments last month. They were videotaped and broadcast on a local cable access station and live-streamed via the Internet. The school board accepted the apology in a statement, reports lohud.com: . 'The Mahopac Board of Education acknowledges the apology of board President Raymond Cote regarding his comments after the close of the board meeting on April 8, 2014. We are disappointed by and do not condone this lapse in judgment on the part of Mr. Cote. 'The Board of Education expects all of its members and meeting participants and attendees to act in a respectful manner. It is our commitment to move forward as a community in a positive manner and focus on the education of our children.' As it happens: Ray Cote, pictured sitting at top in the center of the dais, was aired live and streamed online as he made the comment during the April meeting. He's been school board president since he was elected in 2011 . Officials refused to ID the mother he targeted, at left, however they did say she'd been volunteering on the school board for a decade. President Cote, right, had yet to comment on the debacle by Tuesday evening. Prior to the resignation, parents revealed their ire for the man they elected to lead the community's children. 'It . totally tells us the he cares nothing for the community that he says he . upholds. Nothing,' Deena Bell, who has two high schoolers in the . district, told WABC. The . Journal News says Cote is a member of a diversity and sensitivity initiative . created in March following racist tweets posted by some Mahopac . students during a basketball game. Former . school board member John Molloy had already taken steps to try and . unseat Cote in the days after his comments became publicized. Cote's full comment in reference to the mother of six and 10-year school board volunteer was: . 'A chubby wubby, she keeps getting fatter at every meeting, she really does.' 'I've . contacted the State Education department,' said Molloy. 'We're filing a . formal complaint. I'm waiting to take their lead but we'll file a . formal complaint and ask to have him removed.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Hazed: Brett Griffin, 18, a student at University of Delaware, was pledging to a fraternity in 2008 when he died from alcohol poisoning . A jury on Friday cleared two former members of a University of Delaware fraternity of wrongdoing in the 2008 death of an 18-year-old student who died from alcohol poisoning during a pledge ritual. Ruling in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of Brett Griffin, jurors said former chapter president of Sigma Alpha Mu, Jason Aaron, and former pledge master, Matthew Siracusa, were not responsible. The fraternity and other members previously reached settlements in the case, but attorneys for Aaron, 25, and Siracusa, 26, argued that they were not liable because they did not participate in any hazing of Griffin, and that no one had forced him to drink. Griffin died November 8, 2008, with a blood-alcohol level of .341 - more than four times the legal limit for driving - hours after an initiation ceremony in which he and other pledges were introduced to their ‘big brothers’ and their ‘family drink,’ Delaware Online reported. For Griffin, of Kendal Park, New Jersey, that was a 750-ml bottle of Southern Comfort. Aaron sobbed after the jury panel declared that he did not haze Griffin or put him in a position of peril on the night he died. The jury found that Siracusa, either alone or with others, had hazed Griffin, but that the hazing was not the proximate cause of Griffin's death or any pain or suffering he experienced. Griffin's parents, Tim and Julie Griffin, left the courtroom grim-faced after the verdict. Cleared: A jury found former chapter president of Sigma Alpha Mu, Jason Aaron (left), and former pledge master, Matthew Siracusa (right) not liable in Griffin's death . ‘This is the reason why kids are still dying from hazing in the year 2013,’ Julie Griffin said. ‘Everybody wants to blame the kids.’ Aaron's attorney, David Malatesta, said he was pleased that the jury saw through the plaintiffs' arguments. ‘This was an unfortunate accident, like we said from the beginning, and no one's fault,’ Malatesta said. While relieved at the verdict, Siracusa acknowledged that drinking among college students is a problem. ‘The amount of excess there is, it's out of control,’ he said. Siracusa said he regrets Griffin's death and hopes his parents can find closure, but that he doesn't know what he could have done differently. ‘Yeah, we did some dumb stuff during pledging, but nothing ever to hurt anybody,’ Siracusa said. ‘ Never ever did we make anybody drink... No one was ever in pain or hurting.’ Rite of passage: Griffin and other pledges were lined up in the basement of the fraternity house and forced to eat things that made them throw up before a booze-soaked party . The Griffin family’s attorney argued during the trial that Brett's death was the result of illegal hazing that included lining up pledges in the basement of the fraternity house and forcing them to eat raw onion slathered with hot sauce and drink concoctions that made them vomit. It concluded with an alcohol-fueled party that the fraternity was prohibited from throwing  because of a previous alcohol violation. Liquor overdose: Griffin died with a blood-alcohol level of .341 after consuming the equivalent of a 750-ml bottle of Southern Comfort . In his closing argument Thursday, attorney Doug Fierberg reminded jurors that shortly before Griffin died, he told a friend in a text message that he was going ‘mentally insane’ because of pledging. Both Aaron and Siracusa testified that fraternity members knew when planning the party to celebrate the introduction of Griffin and other pledges to their big brothers that the fraternity was banned from having social events. But Aaron and Siracusa said they did not participate in any alleged hazing of Griffin. Jurors were told that Griffin consumed what amounted to at least an entire bottle of Southern Comfort before passing out in an upstairs room alongside other pledges who also were in drunken stupor. Siracusa testified that he wasn't at the party and instead spent the night with friends at a nearby bar. Aaron attended the party but said he never saw Griffin in any distress, even though the chapter vice president had texted Griffin's big brother, Michael Bassett, saying the teen and other pledges were ‘all dead right now.’ Fierberg told jurors that fraternity members waited nine minutes to call 911 after another brother texted Bassett that Griffin, who had been propped on his side on a couch with a bucket or trash can in which to vomit, was ‘foaming out of his mouth.’","Brett Griffin, a student at University of Delaware, was pledging to Sigma Alpha Mu in 2008 when he died after downing a bottle of Southern Comfort .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . No-one in the long history of major championship golf dating back to 1860 had ever followed up an opening 65 with another round equally as good. Not in 78 Masters tournaments, 95 USPGA Championships, 142 Opens or the first 113 editions of the United States Open. Red hot: Martin Kaymer carded a second successive 65 in the second round at Pinehurst . Something special happened at the 114th at Pinehurst yesterday, therefore, as Martin Kaymer continued his remorseless brilliance to record a second successive score of five under par. His total of 130 strokes beat the old 36 hole record set by Rory McIlroy in 2011 by one and opened up a six shot advantage at halfway. The only other players who have spread-eagled a US Open field to lead by six at this stage are McIlroy three years ago and Tiger Woods in 2000. They went on to win by eight and 15 shots respectively. Sensational: Germany's Martin Kaymer holds a six-shot lead after just 36 holes at the US Open . Kaymer’s nearest pursuer is American Brendon Todd, who must be struggling to understand how he’s so far in arrears after shooting 69-67. Henrik Stenson will start eight behind while Rory McIlroy is nine in arrears after a fine 68. Ian Poulter is on level par while defending champion Justin Rose shot 69 and is on one over but Graeme McDowell faded with a 74. England’s US Amateur Champion Matt Fitzpatrick shot 73 for a four over total only one shot worse than his playing partner, Phil Mickelson. The teenager made the halfway cut and is in prime position to conclude his glittering career in the non-paid ranks by winning the silver medal as low amateur. It was quite a day for young sportsmen from Sheffield, then, and Fitzpatrick revealed afterwards that he and double centurion Joe Root had exchanged congratulatory texts. Focused: Kaymer hits from a bunker on the 14th hole during the second round . What an outstanding opportunity Kaymer has carved out for himself to follow up his Players Championship win in Florida last month with his second major championship success. To think, if he pulls it off, he will have won as many majors before the age of 30 as Bernhard Langer, comfortably the finest German golfer of all time, managed in his entire career. He also holed a putt to win a Ryder Cup at Medinah, lest we forget, whereas Langer, alas, missed one. What feels like a coronation waiting to happen  can look something different altogether, of course, when a player has had more than 24 hours to sleep on his performance. It’s fairly safe to assume the greens will harden up for the final two rounds and chipping from tight lies is not Kaymer’s strongest suit. Chasing: Rory McIlroy remains in contention but will need something special to catch Kaymer . But the 29 year old from Dusseldorf has a formidable record as a frontrunner and it will be a surprise if he doesn’t add this trophy to the USPGA title he won in 2010. He looked like he might dominate the game thereafter but found being world number one and the demands on his time at odds with his aversion of the spotlight. While he adjusted, he fell outside the world’s top 50. Happily, those days of struggle are now behind him, but he retains a nice sense of perspective. Asked by an American how this performance would play in the media back home with the World Cup now underway, he replied: ‘I’m thankful Germany don’t play until Monday, so I might get a mention or two. And if I win, it would play well until the time of the game against Portugal and then it would be forgotten.’ Impressive: English amateur Matthew Fitzpatrick made the cut at Pinehurst . In reality, Kaymer is due home in ten days’ time to play in the BMW International being staged in Cologne, just a 40 minute drive from where he was brought up. You can be sure one or two people would turn up if he was US Open Champion. What a performance he has put on here to date. He needed just 63 shots to play the back nine over the first two days and deserved the odd moment of fortune that came his way. At the 18th, following a rare stray drive into the ‘native area,’ he smiled to himself as he found his ball sitting like a cherry on top of a cake. A couple of errant iron approaches also allowed him to show off his bunker prowess, while he never looked like missing a holeable putt. Close up: Phil Mickelson and amateur Matthew Fitzpatrick line up a putt on the second green . Alongside a member of the elite at the top of his trade we had romance too, in the shape of 49 year old American Fran Quinn. He might be the ultimate example of a journeyman pro. He’s spent his career largely on the Web.com tour, the satellite circuit one rung below the PGA Tour. In his forays on the main circuit dating back to 1988, he’s made a total of $195,000. To put that figure in perspective, there are 173 players on the PGA Tour who have made more than that this season alone. One of the great joys of the two Opens on either side of the Atlantic is that players can come through qualifying and take their place on the biggest stages. With his 15 year old son Owen on the bag, the not so mighty Quinn belied his lowly status with a marvellous first round 68 to be tied second after the opening day. Could he keep it going? He wobbled in the middle of his second round but a 74 meant he comfortably made the halfway cut. He will get to enjoy quite a Father’s Day alongside his son tomorrow.","Kaymer recorded a second successive score of five under par .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Where does Martin Kaymer’s stunning eight-stroke success at the 114th United States Open at Pinehurst stand among the great major championship performances of the last 30 years? Rory McIlroy was kind enough to place it above his own masterclass at Congressional three years ago, which would slot it just below Tiger Woods at his absolute best at Pebble Beach in 2000 and at his absolute bravest at Torrey Pines in 2008. Personally, I wouldn’t go that far. McIlroy was 23 when he won by eight, the youngest winner since Bob Jones in 1923. Kaymer is 29, the sort of age you might expect a golfer to pull off an astounding feat, if he has it within him. How good was it?: Martin Kaymer won the US Open at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club by eight strokes . Admirable: Kaymer won his second major championship in style ahead of Rickie Fowler (right) and Erk Compton . You could see the difference in the admirable manner in which the German managed his game. I didn’t rate his chances because he is relatively poor from the tight lies that were prevalent around the greens, but Kaymer solved that problem with the age-old solution of reaching for his putter. He showed the humility of a champion at the 7th hole during the final round, when a bunker lay between his ball and the flag. Most pros would have taken the challenge on and risked the double bogey, but Kaymer acknowledged his weakness, putted the ball to 20ft and took his one-stroke punishment. Other than that, he was practically blemish free as he followed up his wire-to-wire success on the lush Florida acres at the Players Championship last month with a similar  triumph at burnished Pinehurst. Peak performance: Tiger Woods was at his finest in 2000 when he won the US Open at Pebble Beach . Young gun: Rory McIlroy was 23 when he won the US Open at Congressional Country Club in 2011 . It would be no surprise if he went on a Sir Nick Faldo-like streak and won a bunch of majors in a relatively short space of time. The last time he was this good, after he won the 2010 USPGA Championship, he promptly fell apart. Here was another private man finding it difficult to cope with the spotlight. ‘I was doing countless interviews and I thought I had to say something and make headlines,’ explained Kaymer. ‘Now I’m  comfortable just being myself.’ While a step behind Adam Scott, McIlroy and Henrik Stenson in terms of ballstriking, the advantage he has is his deadliness with the putter. While the aforementioned trio are streaky, Kaymer’s perfect technique rarely lets him down. ‘He’s definitely a more complete player . now than in 2010 and his short game is improving all the time,’ said his . Glaswegian caddie Craig Connelly, whose own part in Kaymer’s success . should not be underestimated. ‘He was talking with Bernhard (Langer) before he went out, who was telling him “Let’s get closer to that German . Grand Slam”. Now there’s only one to go.’ Balanced: When Kaymer won the USPGA Championship in 2010 he didn't know how to handle it . Top team: The influence of Kaymer's caddie Craig Connelly (right) should not be underestimated . With Langer chipping in with two Masters titles, the only one left is the Open, to be staged next month at Royal Liverpool with its plethora of deep bunkers. Kaymer, as it happens, might be as good as anyone in the world right now out of sand. Then there’s the Ryder Cup. The last time at Medinah he was struggling but showed his unbending nerve by sinking the winning putt. This time at Gleneagles he will be the rock of Paul McGinley’s team. ‘He’s got the whole package and he’s obviously someone you wouldn’t relish facing,’ said American Keegan Bradley. One month after Scott’s elevation to world No 1, Kaymer’s victory was another significant landmark for one of the game’s quiet men. Twitter-free, with all his energies and focus on the task at hand. There’s a lesson there, for those willing to learn. How nice that Laura Davies’s first event as a Dame just happens to be the biggest tournament in the women’s game; the US Open. And how fitting that it’s on a Pinehurst course she will adore. If you must give out gongs to people for playing games, it’s hard to think of a more fitting recipient than this 50-year-old standard bearer. Rewarded: Now Dame Laura Davies, the England golfer will compete in the women's US Open at Pinehurst . ‘I’m sure my mates will give me a bit of ribbing over my new title,’ she said, and you can be sure Davies will give it back with the same free spirit that has characterised her play all these years. ‘I heard Martin has been allowed to play the number three course all week. Is that true?’ American Kevin Na wryly sums up the widely-held sense of incredulity among his fellow competitors regarding Martin Kaymer’s earth-shattering performance at Pinehurst No 2 last week. Impressed: Kevin Na isn't alone in his head-shaking admiration of Kaymer's dominant US Open performance . ‘The world’s worst-kept secret,’ said Peter Dawson, chief executive of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, announcing the return of Royal Portrush to the Open rota on Monday. Although it was still secret enough, apparently, to escape the person doing the R&A’s Twitter feed. ‘Still some distance away,’ was the official tweet in reaction to the story in these pages last month.

In the end, the decorated American shot 70 to the Sheffield teenager’s 71, but the third member of the group, defending champion Justin Rose, who fought back valiantly for a 72 of his own, called it perfectly, saying: ‘Matt was just so impressive, he played an outstanding round of golf. The only disappointing thing for him is that he must feel he left several shots out there.’ Close up: Phil Mickelson, right, and Matthew Fitzpatrick on the eighth hole . The most . disappointing of those came at his penultimate hole, the 8th on the . card, when he addressed a chip and his ball moved. Fitzpatrick duly . called in the referee to confirm he needed to add a one shot  penalty. Typical Matt, he didn’t bemoan his luck afterwards or rage at the gods.‘I just thought: “Oops”,’ said the 19 year old. Day . one at the most eagerly anticipated US Open for some years and the . hoopla was justified as McDowell supplied the grit, Rory McIlroy . the glamour, and some of the outstanding young talents in the game . showed their quality and composure. US . Open specialist McDowell was the early leader alongside American Kevin . Na after respective rounds of 68 but Jordan Spieth, the remarkable . 20-year-old Texan, and Japan’s 22-year-old rising son Hideki Matsuyama . also broke par with 69s, as did world No 2 Henrik Stenson and world No 5 . Matt Kuchar. McIlroy played quite beautifully, hitting . 14 greens in regulation and missing just one fairway, but still . finished three shots behind playing partner, G-Mac. Is there another . player in the sport who  manages his game quite as expertly as . McDowell, who won this title in 2010 and finished runner-up in 2012? Tough challenge: Dustin Johnson hits out of the trees on the eighth hole . By . his own admission he didn’t strike the ball very well but the only time . he was ever out of position was on the closing hole, and he still made a . par. McIlroy birdied it to place his round in a deservedly kinder . light. Another contented camper was Ian Poulter, who matched the . stringent par of 70. Three more 70s, and he will almost certainly be collecting his first major come Sunday night. Just why Fitzpatrick will turn pro after this tournament was evident in this exciting display. He will need to find a little length off the tee but other than that the only missing piece is experience. He . gave himself any number of birdie opportunities while a couple of the . saves he made from precarious spots were so good they were positively . Mickelson-esque. And so it was that a shade before 8am the most . alluring threeball of the day made their way to the first tee. You had . to admire Fitzpatrick’s composure as he walked down his first hole. Fitting: Rickie Fowler wearing plus fours in tribute to late Payne Stewart . A . decent number of his supporters were making themselves known and . England’s first US Amateur Champion for more than a century acknowledged . them all. At the Masters there had been first tee nerves and a . double bogey. Here he calmly pitched close to the hole and rolled the . putt in for a birdie. Another followed at the 12th and he actually stood . over a 6ft birdie putt at the 13th for the outright lead. It caught the . hole, alas, and stayed out. When he missed short putts at the next . two as well for bogeys, there was the horrible fear his dream start was . turning into  nightmarish reality. Then came a welcome moment of good . fortune as a long birdie putt at the 16th touched every millimetre of . the hole’s circumference before falling below ground. Fitzpatrick looked . skywards and expressed his relief by blowing out his cheeks and smiling . broadly. By the side of the green, Mickelson caught his eye and . acknowledged the quality of the putt. Testing: Bubba Watson hits a shot from a bunker on the sixth hole . ‘He was like that all day as . was Justin,’ said Fitzpatrick. ‘Whenever I played a good shot they made . sure I heard what they thought about it. It was a great experience for . me. I know my game is currently a long way from theirs, they’re grown . men who have won majors. But I hope to get there one day.’ Outside . the ropes, the masses were getting excited as Mickelson showed all his . class and short game brilliance to move into the lead  at one point, as . he attempts to complete the fabled career grand slam. It was some effort . by the Open champion who will turn 44 next Monday, given the mental . burden of his past history in this event, where he has been runner-up on . no fewer than six occasions. Two dropped shots late on, however, tinged . the round with feelings of disappointment. Mickelson had woken to a . story in the New York Times admitting they had ‘overstated’ the claim he . was being investigated for potential insider trading. ‘As I’ve said all . along, I did nothing wrong but I’ll continue to help the investigation . in any way that I can,’ he said. Scenic: Hudson Swafford hits his tee shot on the 15th hole during the first round . As for Rose, just as he did last . year when he went on to win, he fought back from a horrible start that . saw him reach the turn in four over par. ‘I was definitely thinking . about Merion after nine holes,’ he acknowledged. ‘My short game was . really poor but if I can get that sharp I can really feel confident . about the rest of the week because I’m striking the ball better than I . have for a while.’ A crowded leaderboard, therefore, and a gorgeous . mix of  established figures and men of promise who will undoubtedly . leave their mark on the game in years to come. Pinehurst is living up to the hype.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Click here for the latest leaderboard from Sawgrass . The flagship event on the PGA Tour appears set for a fabulous finish on Sunday with two European Ryder Cup heroes pitted against the man who looks the future of American golf. As he has since day one at the Players Championship, German Martin Kaymer will head into the final round with the lead but 20 year old Jordan Spieth caught him on the 18th on Saturday after holing a clutch 15ft putt for par. It meant the amazing Spieth, who went so close to winning the Masters last month, has now completed 54 holes on this devilish layout without a single bogey, and all on his debut as well. What a truly remarkable statistic that is given bogeys and much worse are lurking at every turn. Up there: Germany's Martin Kaymer shares the lead with 20-year-old Jordan Spieth . The only other player to complete three rounds bogey-free in the history of this event was Greg Norman way back in 1994. The pair stand on twelve under, with 29 year old Kaymer giving up the outright lead after an untidy finish that saw him fail to get the birdie on offer at the 16th and then bogey the last. There is so much at stake for Kaymer. A victory here would not only earn him a cheque for $1.8 million but catapult the man who holed the winning putt at the last Ryder Cup firmly into the reckoning for this year’s match at Gleneagles. It would also mean a return to the limelight after a lean period since his heroics at Medinah. That weak finish, though, will encourage his great pal Sergio Garcia that he can complete a spectacular act of redemption of his own. Garcia shot 69 to stand tied third alongside Australian John Senden, with the pair just three shots off the pace. It was at this event last year that . Garcia declared his dislike of Tiger Woods to provoke a storm of . controversy. In a shootout with Woods on Sunday, Garcia then put two . balls into the water at the 17th. One last go: Jordan Spieth caught Kaymer on the 18th and also goes in 12 under . One minute he was playing for a first prize of $1.7 million and the next he was walking away with a cheque for $200,000. To compound his misery, Woods went on to win the event. Now, a year has made a world of difference with Tiger unable to defend his title and the temperamental Spaniard once more in the mix. On the other side of the ledger to last year’s blow-up, Garcia will also be able to draw on some good memories today. In 2008, he claimed the biggest prize of his career to date with a win here. Also in with a shout of his biggest-ever win is Lee Westwood, who won in Malaysia two weeks ago. Westwood shot 71, but might have cause to rue a poor finish of two bogeys in his last six holes. It meant he had to settle for a 71 and he will start five shots off the lead. Disappointing: Westwood shot 71, but will rue a poor finish of two bogeys in his last six holes . US Open Champion Justin Rose looked as if he would be starting on the same mark but he was assessed a two shot penalty after his ball moved a fraction on the 18th after he had addressed a chip from just behind the green. Rose thought it had moved, and the gut-wrenching news was later confirmed when he watched a slow motion replay. It meant a 73 instead of a 71 and a five under total that surely removes him from contention. The game could also see a new world number one, with Australian Adam Scott and Henrik Stenson poised to strike. Newly-wed Scott needs to tip-toe into the top 16 to overtake Tiger Woods and lies two shots off that mark after a 69 on Saturday. Swede Stenson is two shots nearer the lead on five under and three strokes off the top six placing he needs after a 70. Picturesque: Sergio Garcia of Spain hits from the 17th tee during the third round . No such targets for Rory McIlroy to play for on Sunday, alas. This time last week he was saying he was getting a little bored playing for ‘back door’ top ten finishes, meaning coming through the field with a good final round. But that, for the third successive tournament, was his only goal as he began the final round in 28th place – ten shots off the lead – after a 69. For the second day in a row he recovered from an awful front nine with a fine inward half completed in just 31 shots. It means that for his first three rounds McIlroy has taken a total of 117 shots to complete the front nine – and just 96 blows to play the inward nine. How’s that for a game of two halves? Against the rules: Justin Rose received a two-shot penalty after his ball moved on the 18th .","Germany's Martin Kaymer and American  Jordan Spieth go in at 12 under .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . One former champion lost his life and the other lost his game. They say great courses produce great champions but Pinehurst is a great course with a US Open legacy both tragic and mysterious. Payne Stewart and Michael Campbell were in the prime of their professional lives when they won in 1999 and 2005 respectively. Stewart was the once-brash bon vivant who had matured gracefully. In winning by one stroke, he had words only for the vanquished, Phil Mickelson. Tragic: Payne Stewart died a few months after winning the 1999 US Open . A month later he put an arm around Tiger Woods's shoulder and took him for a walk along the fairways in Waterville in Ireland and sang songs with the locals. That September he was the only American to emerge with any credit from the Ryder Cup nonsense at Brookline, conceding a 20ft putt to Colin Montgomerie because he was so sickened by the abuse the Scot was receiving. Three weeks on, he was on a private plane that never reached its destination. The saddest thing I have ever covered was the tournament that followed in Houston. Stewart had barely entered his 40s and had won over all his peers. This was fate at its most savagely cruel. They stopped Parliament and brought a television into the debating chamber when Campbell battled Tiger Woods down the stretch. It was Monday morning in his native New Zealand and there was no stopping the celebratory mood when Cambo did what few others ever managed and jousted successfully with Woods in his prime. Later that year, he won the World Match Play at Wentworth. When he went home to Wellington, they organised a Welcome Home parade. Sealed with a kiss: Michael Campbell celebrates winning the 2005 US Open . The years since have not been so kind. Campbell didn't know what to do after achieving his lifetime's ambition of winning a major. Some days he struggled to get out of bed. For years he struggled to turn in a good score. He hasn't won a single tournament since that golden year. In January, I had a beer with him in Abu Dhabi. He had just got the news that a foot injury was far worse than he thought and it would be several months before we saw him again. We still haven't seen him. Last month, he combined the news he would be missing from Pinehurst with the sad addendum he had split up from his wife, Julie. It is not just the winners, either. Look at the runners-up from 1999 and 2005. Mickelson is playing under the cloud of being the subject of an FBI investigation into potential insider trading; Woods, like Campbell, is sitting at home.  At Pinehurst this week we will revel in the inevitable twists and turns a major brings and end up saluting the winner of America's national championship. But let's hope the victory brings lasting joy, rather than a sense of sadness and loss in the years to come. Quote of the week . 'I don't know 100 per cent but I'm pretty sure I grounded my club in the bunker. For five days I practised but I couldn't get it off my mind. It's heartbreaking but it's the right decision.' Honest: Jason Millard disqualified himself for possible rules breach . Five days after qualifying for the US Open, American Jason Millard (pictured above) disqualified himself for this possible rules breach nobody else had seen. Say what you like about golfers but when it comes to integrity on the field of play, they stand alone. It's a major scandal that Brit star Charley is missing out . Looking down the entry list at every major championship usually affords a moment's reflection to lament the absence of one or two players. There is one omission from the US Women's Open at Pinehurst next week, however, that is so wrong on every level it provokes a sense of outrage. Teen sensation: Charley Hull from Woburn is the best young female golfer in Europe . Charley Hull from Woburn is, by common consent, the best young female golfer in Europe. The 18-year-old is also No 1 on the European women's order of merit. And yet she is not playing. Just to put the tin lid on matters, the bigwigs at the United States Golf Association are presently congratulating themselves on what they perceive as their unique exercise in democracy. A men's and women's Open are being played back to back on the same course for the first time and already we are being treated to homilies proclaiming equal treatment of the sexes. How hypocritical. Never mind that the women are being paid far less than the men in prize money. If the entry criteria for both events was the same, Hull would have qualified several times over. She is 33rd in the world, was the star of the last Solheim Cup and finished seventh in the season's first major, for heaven's sake. And how disrespectful for the European No 1 not to be exempt. Imagine if they tried that with the men! The USGA are forever telling us about their efforts at growing the game among juniors and here was a golden chance to offer a special exemption to a young role model fully deserving of one. Instead, they blew it. Shame on them.","Payne Stewart died a few months after winning the 1999 US Open .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Not since the great Seve Ballesteros was in his heyday has a Spaniard descended on Wentworth with quite as much going for him as the remarkable Miguel Angel Jimenez at the BMW PGA Championship this week. Who would dare argue now that 50 is not the new 30 after a month in which Jimenez appears to have lived out the ultimate middle-aged male fantasy? Let’s see: played at Augusta National and finished in the top four at the Masters; met up with his old mates on the Champions Tour and won his first event; came back home and got married to a woman half his age; played in his home Open and became the first golfer over the age of 50 to win on the European Tour. How’s that for a bucket list rattled off in the space of just 35 days? 50 years young: Miguel Angel Jimenez is in prodigious form coming into this week's PGA Championship . 27th time lucky: Jimenez was a popular winner of the Spanish Open at Catalunya Resort . As Jose Maria Olazabal said to him on the eve of the final round at Augusta: ‘You know how much I admired Seve, how much I learned from him, how he was my hero. Look at me. Today my hero is you.’ It’s not just Olazabal. There’s not a golfer at the European Tour’s flagship event who couldn’t learn from him. The gym rats could learn you can be the fittest golfer in the world but it’s not much use if you’re not fit for golf. The strung-out obsessives could learn the value of a relaxing glass of wine and the importance of remembering that playing the game for a living remains an enormous privilege. Those who only play well on certain courses could learn from the man who always begins every event with the odds stacked heavily against him but doesn’t know the meaning of the word ‘can’t’. Defying convention: The Spanish veteran takes his fun attitude towards life onto the course, and it works . And those . who place too much importance on appearance money, well they could learn . about loyalty from the man who kept his own European Tour event alive . with his own money as the Spanish economy hurtled towards oblivion; a . player who’d cut off his ponytail before he’d turn his back on the . European Masters in Switzerland because of how well they’ve treated him . over the years; who’s given up millions in senior golf earnings to . pursue his dream of becoming the oldest European to compete in the Ryder . Cup. Sunday’s . fabulous feel-good victory at the Spanish Open - he won it for the . first time at the 27th attempt - showed just why he is right to believe. He might be one spot outside the automatic placings but right now he is . the only player with two victories to his name in full-field events . during the qualifying process. And the Ryder Cup is all about winners. Love of his life: Jimenez with Susanne Styblo, who he married this month, ahead of the 2012 Ryder Cup . Married his birdie: Jimenez tied the knot with Susanna Styblo in Torremolinos this month . How does he do it, with his funky swing, portly physique and the fact he gets outdriven by 40 yards on most holes? It has become perhaps the most oft-asked question in golf. No-one ever supplied a better answer than former Open champion Tom Lehman. ‘He plays the game the way we all want to play. He has fun,’ said the former US Ryder Cup captain. ‘That’s the key to a long career. A big part of why Miguel is still so good is he carries over his philosophy of living to his game.’ And so it is that the middle-aged males, that most ubiquitous of golfing species in Britain, will arrive at Wentworth in their thousands this week with a little extra jaunt to their stride. They thought it was something when their hero won the PGA at the age of 44. They marvelled when he came back from breaking his leg in a skiing accident to finish fourth last year at 49. Now here he is again, still the man making everything seem possible. Once it was Seve who captured their imagination for being the man they all wished they could be. Now it is Jimenez, the man they all wished they had become. Fire in the belly: Jimenez shows frustration at a tee shot at Augusta this year, where he finished fourth . Among the willing youngsters carrying mobile scoreboards with each group at the PGA this week is Annabel Dimmock, who has a big event of her own looming on the horizon. At just 17, the Wentworth teenager has been selected to represent Britain and Ireland in the Curtis Cup in Missouri next month, thus becoming one of its youngest ever participants. ‘Watching the top men close up, I’m hoping to pick up some playing and tactical hints,’ says Annabel. QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘We can’t wait to play at Wentworth and get the PGA crowd rocking. We’re all big golf fans, so it’s a gig we’re all looking forward to.’ Who could have imagined a member of The Who saying that? Did rock get old or golf become young? Anyway, Kenney Jones, who took over on drums when Keith Moon died, will lead his own band featuring former members of Bad Company, Procol Harum and Foreigner - if you’re under 30, ask your parents - in a free concert for PGA ticketholders on Saturday.","Jimenez takes form into the PGA Championship at Wentworth this week .

French World Cup winner Patrick Vieira has suggested that England's difficulties stem from 'a lack of pure talent' currently at the disposal of manager Roy Hodgson. The Three Lions slumped to the country's worst performance at a World Cup in 56 years, exiting at the group stages after failing to win against any of Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica. Vieira has identified a dearth of top quality players and the need to address issues at grassroots level as the primary reasons behind England's struggles.

Speaking at a press conference in the Croatian coastal town of Novigrad, where Vieira is managing the Manchester City Elite Development Squad at their pre-season training camp, the Frenchman said: 'I think for all the people who love England and love English football like I do, it was very disappointing. 'They have to learn from the mistakes and improve the talent. The problem is more in the grassroots than in the club teams. Asked to divulge further on the mistakes that England have made, Vieira replied: 'It's hard to analyse that. From the outside, I think it's maybe a lack of pure talent.' Vieira was, however, more impressed by the performance of his native France, who reached the quarter-finals in Brazil and demonstrated a vast improvement from an acrimonious campaign at the World Cup in South Africa in 2010: 'I was very proud of the team. I think we play some good football but we need to more mature.

Arsene Wenger has raised question marks over Frank Lampard’s shock move to Manchester City, but Jose Mourinho insisted that the former Chelsea man would be welcome back at Stamford Bridge. The 36-year-old will join the Barclays Premier League champions on loan until January as he looks to maintain his fitness ahead of next year’s MLS season. Lampard has signed a two-year contract with emerging MLS side New York City FC, but the club do not enter the American league until March 2015. VIDEO Scroll down to see Arsene Wenger raise FFP concerns regarding Frank Lampard loan . Return: Lampard has recently signed for New York City but will be back in England on loan at Man City . Asking questions: Wenger says he is unsure how City's loan deal complies with Financial Fair Play rules . Manchester City, New York City FC and Melbourne City are all owned by holding company City Football Group. The company also have a minority share holding in Japanese club Yokohama Marinos. Lampard could be important to Manuel Pellegrini in the Champions League given he counts as a homegrown player. City must include five homegrown players in a restricted 21-man squad in the competition after they failed Uefa’s Financial Fair Play test. And Wenger, whose side face City in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday, admitted: ‘Lampard’s move to Manchester City is a surprise as after the statements we heard, it looks like all these “City” clubs will feed the main club. Welcome: Lampard left Chelsea this summer after 13 years at the club and will remain a club legend . No problem: Mourinho refused to complain about the move, saying Lampard was free to join who he liked . ‘I heard they want to buy five clubs all around the world. I don’t know the rules well enough. ‘They bought the New York franchise for $100m in the States to play next season and at moment the players they sign cannot play until next year. ‘They will register in the clubs where they will put them and they can get out on loan. Is it a way to get around (financial) fair play? I don’t know. He added: ‘Would Arsenal do that? We are happy to dedicate the money we make just to run our club as there is not a lot of surplus to buy other clubs.’ However Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said he had no hard feelings towards the club legend, and that he was welcome to join any club. Partnership: New York City, where Lampard has signed, are owned by City Football Group . ‘He is a free agent he can choose his club so I have no problem at all,’ Mourinho said. ‘When he comes to Stamford Bridge he is welcome. When he comes to the Emirates…. He is at the Emirates. There is no problem.’ Meanwhile, Thomas Vermaelen is unwilling to sign a new contract at Arsenal, edging him a step closer to the exit door. The Gunners captain’s contract expires at the end of the forthcoming season and the club had been keen on offering him fresh terms. But the Belgium international does not want to open talks about extending his contract. Time to go? Arsenal captain Vermaelen looks to be on the verge of leaving the club . VIDEO Vermaelen could go - Wenger . Unless Arsenal sell him in the current transfer window, it means the central-defender can sign a pre-contract agreement with an overseas side from January. Arsenal do not want to sell their captain this summer, but also want to avoid the possibility of losing him for nothing next year. Barcelona, Manchester United and Napoli all have a firm interest in Vermalelen. Arsenal would prefer to sell Vermaelen abroad rather than to United, which will prove a difficult stumbling block to overcome for Louis van Gaal. The Gunners snubbed an initial £7million enquiry from United earlier this summer. Success: Vermaelen captained Arsenal to the FA Cup last season, ending their nine-year trophy drought . And with Arsenal expecting Barca to make their move for Vermaelen in the coming days, the Belgian’s future could come to a head sooner rather than later.

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . It may be a little cruel to suggest the green look on Friday to the Ageas Bowl pitch for the third Test will suit India more than England’s bowlers but there is no question it is not just Alastair Cook under severe pressure on Sunday. The failure of England’s attack to take advantage of conditions made for them at Lord’s means there are question marks over the senior bowlers going into a match where the consequences of another defeat would not bear thinking about. The success of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and then, with short-pitched bowling that had failed England, Ishant Sharma was a salutary lesson to an England attack who should have had the Test won on the first morning after Cook won the toss. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alastair Cook and his squad playing rugby ahead of third Test . Decision time: England captain Alastair Cook must decide whether to change his bowling attack . Old guard: James Anderson (left) and Stuart Broad (right) could be dropped after a poor second Test . New generation? Simon Kerrigan (left) or Chris Jordan (right) could come into the side for the third Test . Agonising: Cook tilts his head back in frustration as he plays rugby during England training . Clearly, Cook had his senior players in mind when he said in the aftermath of the second Test embarrassment that England had not lost because of his captaincy and he will consider two changes on Sunday to a misfiring attack. Peter Moores famously brought Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad into the England side at the expense of Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard in New Zealand during his first reign as coach and now he must decide whether the time is right to call time, at least temporarily, on one of the big two. Neither Anderson nor Broad are coming to the end of the line but, with three back-to-back Tests still to come, the time is surely right to freshen up the attack and allow Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes a chance to prove their worth. The last thing England need is to go back to the days in the 80s and 90s when their constant chopping and changing undermined a fragile side but there is a strong case for Jordan, in superb form for Sussex, to replace Ben Stokes. Jordan was unlucky to be dropped in the first place after making an outstanding impression in one-day cricket but there was a feeling he was still stuck in limited-overs mode in a Headingley Test against Sri Lanka where he failed to take a single wicket. New generation? England coach Peter Moores may change one, or both, of Anderson and Broad . Recall? Chris Jordan could return to the side having featured in both Tests against Sri Lanka this summer . Falling over: Woakes will hope to get his chance to stake his claim to be an England all-rounder this week . Still smiling: All-rounder Ben Stokes is likely to be dropped after a horrendous run with the bat for England . Laugh and joke: Anderson (left) runs with a rugby ball during training as Moeen Ali (right) tries to catch him . Taking on the field: Cook's captaincy has come under scrutiny recently and he needs a big third Test . Looking up? England lost the second Test and trail 1-0 in the series but need to avoid defeat at the Ageas Bowl . Now Jordan is said to have got his wrist position right again for first-class cricket and was swinging the ball at pace at Horsham against Warwickshire this week. Stokes has a huge role to play in England’s future but his woeful run with the bat means he will surely miss out now. It is whether Woakes replaces either Anderson, Broad or even Liam Plunkett that provides England with an intriguing question on a pitch that Hampshire believe will have pace, bounce and carry. Clearly it is harsh to blame Anderson for what has gone wrong this season because he was man of the series against Sri Lanka, man of the match against India at Trent Bridge and has thrown his heart and soul into the ‘new’ England. Yet his failure to live up to his billing as the best swing bowler in the world when it most mattered at Lord’s was an indication, as much as anything, of his severe workload that is exacerbated by the retirement of Graeme Swann. Anderson looked out on his feet at Lord’s and has the threat of suspension for the last two Tests of the series hanging over him so England must decide whether to utilise him now or take him out of the firing line. Broad simply did not look fit at Lord’s, where he had perhaps his worst Test for England for many a year, and clearly the knee injury that has restricted his potency will need an operation sooner rather than later. Yet he is a fighter and both wants and expects to play in the first ever Test in England to start on a Sunday, a move which has seriously hampered Hampshire’s chances of cashing in on only their second Test at this purpose-built ground. Debutant: Exciting wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler will replace Matt Prior in the England side .

Poor form: Broad (second right) is under pressure to perform having had his worst match for England at Lord's . Looking on: James Anderson (centre) talks to his team-mates during a meeting on the pitch in training . Ticket sales have been sluggish with the ground expected to be no more than half full from Monday onwards but one man who just might provide the spark that could put more bottoms on Ageas Bowl seats is debutant Jos Buttler. All the young players brought into the England side this year have made an impression but none are as potentially exciting as the gifted Buttler, who must now try to bring his innovative, explosive game to Test cricket. ‘Test cricket has been my ultimate goal and this has probably come a bit sooner than I expected,’ said Buttler on Friday. ‘But it means I’m going in the right direction and I’m excited about Sunday.’ Buttler had insisted after his sublime one-day century against Sri Lanka at Lord’s earlier this season that he was not ready for Test cricket but the physical demise of Matt Prior has elevated him to the all important batsman-keeper slot. Out: England wicketkeeper Matt Prior is taking a break from cricket as he recovers from injury . Throwing it away: England do not want to go 2-0 down in the series with a defeat at the Ageas Bowl . ‘Mentally I’ve come round to the fact I was closer than I thought at the time because my cricket has progressed quickly,’ said the softly-spoken Buttler. ‘Test cricket is going to be completely different but this year I’ve been scoring more runs in the championship and everything’s been going well.’ Now Buttler, who admits he will have to adapt his game to the ultimate format, has the added responsibility of having to excite as well as score runs and provide glovework that he admits is ‘still a work in progress.’ ‘If you look around the world there are people who play in an aggressive manner and do well,’ said the man who joined Lancashire this season to keep regularly. ‘When Kevin Pietersen played for England people were excited to watch him and David Warner has filled that role with Australia. It would be silly of me to go into my shell completely and curb my natural instincts.’ There is much for Buttler and whatever bowlers form the England attack to play for on Sunday. Goal: Captain MS Dhoni will be hoping to help India to go 2-0 up in the series at the Ageas Bowl .

England backed their two big bowlers to come good in the third Test, and Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad stood up to be counted on a third day at the Ageas Bowl that was almost as satisfying for their captain as the opening two. It is their senior players who England hoped would carry them through this transitional summer. They let the side down at Lord’s but on Tuesday Anderson and Broad joined Alastair Cook and Ian Bell in leading the way. Wickets were never going to come easily on an easy-paced pitch under a fierce Hampshire sun but England whittled away to leave India 323 for eight, still 246 behind, with two days to try to force a  priceless victory.

The . question was who would miss out and up until the eve of this match it . seemed Broad would be rested here after one of his worst Tests in years . and with his right knee needing an operation sooner rather than later. Thankfully . for England, such thoughts were resisted, probably because Broad . insisted he was fit for action, and this most competitive of cricketers . was back to his best, at least until the demands of the day appeared to . catch up with him late on. Broad . said at the close: ‘Peter Moores told the senior players to go out and . play like it was our  first Test. Cooky and Belly were fantastic with . the bat and now Jimmy and I have contributed with the ball. Hopefully . the wicket will deteriorate now.’ There . was never any danger of Anderson missing out here, not least because he . could be suspended for the last two Tests, and he was the pick of the . attack as India struggled to climb the mountain that England’s 569 for . seven represented. It could . be argued that England were too quick to ring the changes, even though . they were at close to rock bottom after Lord’s, and certainly it is . questionable whether leaving out Liam Plunkett and Ben Stokes has . improved their attack. The . dropped pair took nine of the 20 India wickets to fall at Lord’s, even . though Plunkett was poor in the first innings and Stokes’s problem was . more with his batting than his bowling, while Jordan and Woakes . went wicketless.

Warwickshire at Horsham last week but here he struggled for rhythm and . accuracy and left Cook a bowler down on another flat pitch.

Cook would have been wary of over-bowling his big two, which he has . tended to do this summer, he again seemed reluctant to give as many . overs as he should have done to Moeen Ali’s developing off-spin. What . an interesting couple of days Moeen has had. A point to be made about . his wrist-band ‘protest’.

At least here we have an . intelligent, principled man, and a proud Briton and Muslim, who wanted . to make a point about a humanitarian issue. He should not be criticised for that, nor slapped on the wrist by the ineffectual International Cricket Council. As . a spinner, Moeen is not and probably never will be in Graeme Swann’s . league but he is taking wickets and added a couple more here when his . captain eventually turned to him, admittedly to awful shots from Rohit . Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane.Moeen should have had Rahane much earlier when . he was caught down the legside by Jos Buttler, who had an excellent . first full day behind the stumps, but Rod Tucker made his latest . umpiring mistake.

Tail-end . resistance has been England’s curse in recent times and they will again . be frustrated that they allowed India to recover from 217 for six to . their eventual 323 for eight, which gives them hope of avoiding the . follow-on figure.

To . that end Cook, without a hundred in 27 innings, will summon the spirit . of 2010 when his form was so bad that he just threw caution to the wind . at The Oval and made a century against Pakistan that saved his . international career.

Netting: England captain Cook is without a century since May 2013 against New Zealand . It’s England’s worst losing run for 20 years and now they must surely win the third Test against India at Southampton to save Alastair Cook’s job. The run of ten Tests without a win is their worst since 1992-93, when teams led by Graham Gooch, Alec Stewart and Michael Atherton lost nine out of ten matches.

Cook . knows that there is now almost a universal belief among his . predecessors in the commentary boxes that he should step down, even . though he has experience of leading England from 1-0 down against India . to win a series. ‘I . would much rather they said nice things about me,’ he admitted. ‘But . they’ve all been through it and if you are not winning games and not . scoring runs it goes with the territory. 'Does . it affect me? I would rather they didn’t say it, but I am quite a . strong-willed guy who does not take too much notice of the media. ‘I . have got to make sure I am concentrating on myself over the next five . days and not what people are thinking in the commentary box.

The . word is still that England want to bring both Chris Jordan and Chris . Woakes into the side, as well as debutant Jos Buttler, but it is the . question of who stands down that needs to be addressed. MS .

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Forget coach-speak about technique and the biomechanics of bowling. The best piece of advice Liam Plunkett ever received was a typically blunt message from Geoff Boycott when he joined Yorkshire less than two years ago. ‘I met him when I first signed and he just said ‘don’t think, just bowl’ and walked off,’ said the Durham man whose career was reborn at Headingley. ‘That’s all he said to me and I haven’t spoken to him since. But it makes sense when I think about it now. I bowl best when I don’t think too much about it.’ Plunkett, now 29, had plenty of time to think about a career that had promised far more than it had delivered before he was called up for his 10th Test last week seven years after his ninth and what seemed final game at the highest level. VIDEO Scroll down for Cook, Anderson, Broad and Root look forward to Headingley . In from the cold: Liam Plunkett was recalled for the Test series against Sri Lanka after a seven year absence . Practice makes perfect: England's Liam Plunkett, trains during a nets session at Headingley, Leeds . His future in the county game, let . alone at international level, was in jeopardy when his bowling slipped . so far that he could barely make the Durham team and sought his release . in 2012 to start all over again at Headingley. Under . Yorkshire’s Australian coach Jason Gillespie, who elaborated on . Boycott’s simple message and gave Plunkett his head, he has become the . 90 mph plus bowler England hope can be their answer to Mitchell Johnson. Now, after impressing in . the first Investec Test at Lord’s more than his two wickets on a pitch . that could not have suited him less would suggest, he will take on Sri . Lanka on his home ground tomorrow eager to take his belated chance. ‘To . play in that first Test was massive for me,’ said Plunkett. ‘I was . young when I first played for England and I didn’t know my game too . well. I would turn up day after day just hoping for the best but I’ve . got clarity in my role now. ‘I . didn’t really know what kind of bowler I was back then. Was I a pitch . it and up and swing it bowler? A seamer? But I know what I am now. I run . in and hit the pitch hard and back myself to do that. ‘On . different days different things will be needed but I can’t imagine . England have brought me in to be an 80 mph swinger. They’ve brought me . in to bowl quick and be aggressive. I love that role for Yorkshire and . if that’s what England want me to do then I’m more than happy to do it.’ Say what you mean! Geoff Boycott's (R) advice to Liam Plunkett was simply, 'Don't think, just bowl!' So what went wrong last . time, when Duncan Fletcher called up a raw but quick Durham bowler who . then, so the theory goes, was messed up by too much technical advice and . tinkering with his basic action? Were the coaches culpable? ‘Different . coaches told me different things and when you’re a youngster you’re . like a sponge and take a lot of things in,’ said Plunkett. ‘I think you . learn when you’re older to filter stuff. If it’s good advice you can . keep it and take it with you but if it’s not you can say no thanks. ‘I . can blame others but I went to people saying ‘what am I doing wrong?’ and ‘what do I need to work on?’ So I have to blame myself as well but . when you take a lot in it all becomes a bit too much. Speed  demon: Liam Plunkett impressed with the two wickets he took at the first Test against Sri Lanka . ‘Each . day I would turn up and try to do something different. I’d work on my . front arm one day and my back leg the next so that if I performed well I . didn’t know where it came from. I’d just go back to training not sure . what I was doing. Now I’m a bit older and a bit smarter and I do . appreciate what I’ve been through. I appreciate being here with England a . lot more now than I did then.’ It . was the short move from Durham to Yorkshire for a Middlesbrough boy who . could have joined either as a teenager that proved the key to his . second coming. ‘I would have loved to have played more for England, . maybe  approaching my 100th Test like Ian Bell, but it wasn’t meant to . be and that’s my fault,’ he said. ‘There were things that I did outside . of cricket (Plunkett has twice been banned for drink driving). I wasn’t . consistent enough in my training. ‘There . have been ups and downs, but coming to Yorkshire was the best thing I . could ever have done. I had a year left on my contract at Durham but I . wanted to move because, it’s like any job, you can feel a bit stale. I’d . fallen out of love with cricket really but I’m playing for fun again . now and as soon as I did that the results started coming.’ Matured: Liam Plunkett claims he is 'older and smarter' than when he last played Test cricket in 2007 . The most . important spectator at Headingley tomorrow for Plunkett is his father . Alan, who will be travelling down from Middlesbrough for the occasion. Seven years ago Plunkett senior turned down his son’s offer of a kidney . when he became ill because he was worried how it would affect his . cricket. Now fully recovered he is just back in time from a holiday in . Cyprus to see his son play. ‘Dad . didn’t take my kidney because he wanted to me to play for England,’ added Plunkett. ‘He was on dialysis for quite a few years and that can . be tedious. Eventually a new kidney came up and he’s fine now. He’s been . on holiday and he’s healthy. He said to me the other day ‘I honestly . thought you’d never play for England again but you’ve proved me wrong.’ I’m upset he didn’t back me….’ The . last line is said with the smile of a man who has found contentment . after going round the block a few times in county cricket and in life.

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . England did not make a mistake on Tuesday in keeping faith with Alastair Cook.  Neither did they make a mistake by backing every player bar Matt Prior who let them down so badly at Lord’s. But they did mess up in taking so long to let the public know their third Test plans. There was never any question of Cook jumping or being pushed, but in waiting until gone 3.30pm to announce a 13-man squad for the Ageas Bowl on Sunday, the selectors allowed speculation to run wild. Cook was going to be sacked, it was said. Cook was going to stay as captain but he was going to be rested for the rest of the season, it was suggested. Cook wanted to quit but was talked out of it, was another rumour doing the rounds. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Alastair Cook gives his reaction from second test loss to India' Scrutiny: The duo of Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores have really struggled so far this summer . The truth is England are holding their nerve on Cook while the captain himself, described as a ‘stubborn so-and-so’ on Tuesday by one of those closest to him, has no intention of giving up on the leadership just yet. His future was not even on the agenda when Peter Moores, James Whitaker, Angus Fraser and Mick Newell met and decided, as expected, to bring in Jos Buttler for Matt Prior and retain those others who threw the Lord’s Test away. The bottom line is that Cook has three Tests to save his captaincy and he accepts he will have to go if he cannot regain his form at Southampton, Old Trafford or the Oval and England lose this series. For what it’s worth, I absolutely agree with that, even though I appear to be in an increasing minority with some very credible sources now saying that time should be called on Cook, for his own sake as much as England’s. Nasser Hussain and Mike Atherton are two of the most respected voices in cricket — to be honest, they should be running the English game but administration’s loss is the media’s gain —and when they speak I usually listen. But even though those former England captains have said that Cook should go, I believe he has earned the right to try to do what he did in India two years ago and overturn a 1-0 deficit to win a Test series. Cook has been badly let down by his senior players, those who England hoped would not only create the right culture and environment for young players to thrive, but would also set the right example with their performances. Cooky crumbles . Pressure: Alastair Cook is under significant scrutiny as England captain . Instead, Ian Bell, such a key figure, is in almost as bad form as Cook, Prior has been forced to concede defeat in his battle against the ravages of time and Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad had the perfect chance to win the second Test on the first day but under-performed when conditions were made for them. Cook is said to be in more defiant mood than in Australia, when he considered packing it all in after the Sydney one-day international. He believes there were signs at Lord’s of his form coming back, he is getting on well with Peter Moores and is learning to compartmentalise after becoming a father. Those clamouring for his head should remember that we are talking about one of England’s best-ever batsmen and a captain good enough to win that series in India and the Ashes last summer, before England’s world came tumbling down. Most important of all, he is a decent man who commands respect. That England collapse has been spectacularly rapid and another pillar of the side which went to No 1 in the world has gone now that Prior has admitted he is not fit enough to continue. Coming in: Jos Buttler has been called in to replace the injured Matt Prior . Poor form: Ian Bell has been struggling nearly as badly as Cook with the bat . The keeper-batsman has been integral to England’s successes and has been a selfless, positive presence in the team. We should wish him well while appreciating that some senior players must remain. The form and fitness of another of those senior men — Stuart Broad — was a much bigger issue for the selectors yesterday and it would be no surprise if he was told to rest his damaged knee at the Ageas Bowl. England may have picked a virtually unchanged squad — Simon Kerrigan was only ever at Lord’s as part of his rehabilitation — but Sportsmail understands they will make three changes, Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes almost certainly coming in as well as the gifted Buttler, perhaps for Broad and Ben Stokes. Stokes is in a horror batting run but is a big part of England’s future. His presence in the squad shows they want to carry on working with him and the other young players who have created such a good impression this year. Issues at the crease: And his batting form has suffered badly as well in recent times . Dip: He is without a century now in 27 innings, and is averaging just 14 this year . For that is the paradox. Every new face introduced by England has done well to a degree and they will be joined in Southampton by the hugely talented Buttler, who has done so well in limited-overs cricket. A word of caution. Buttler, the most inventive of batsmen, is far from the finished article with the gloves and may make mistakes, as Prior did when he emerged in 2007. Patience, a virtue in understandably short supply after a run of seven defeats in 10 winless Tests, may be needed with him. The seniors do not deserve as much patience and there were some harsh words in the England dressing room on Monday night. There will be more from the coaches on Friday when England convene again in this non-stop series with the need for more heart, passion and desire emphasised by Moores and Paul Farbrace. It was never going to be easy this year after a 5-0 humiliation in the Ashes, but it is proving far tougher than anyone involved with England ever imagined. What Alastair Cook, Peter Moores and Paul Downton need to do more than ever is hold their nerve. The signs yesterday were that they are doing just that.","It wasn't a mistake for England to keep faith with captain Cook .

Plunkett, who was dismissed off the last ball of the day at Headingley when he first acted as nightwatchman against Sri Lanka, this time showed the batting style which marks him out as bowling all-rounder material. ‘I take pride in my batting, I love to bat,’ said Plunkett, who volunteered to go in ahead of Matt Prior on Friday night with the new ball imminent. ‘I started out as a batsman at junior level and I still work hard at it.

Boost: England's Plunkett celebrates taking the wicket of Cheteshwar Pujara during India's second innings . Glory: Plunkett runs off to celebrate the wicket of Virat Kohli, his second in just two balls against India at Lord's . ‘Last night I was trying to line it up and was prepared to take one on the body if necessary but then I had the freedom to play my shots. It’s great to get a 50. ‘I’m absolutely over the moon with it. ‘I’ve been working hard to be honest with you. I’ve felt good with the bat all year and I’ve been working on some stuff. Last night when I came in as nightwatchman I worked really hard on lining it up and I felt in good nick and then came out in the morning a little bit more confident.’ Plunkett, who has been used mainly as an enforcer in his second coming for England, admitted that he got it wrong in the first innings when he was culpable as India scored at least a hundred more than they should have on a green pitch. Expansive: Plunkett started his junior career as a batsman and has the potential to be an England all-rounder . High point: England celebrate after Plunkett dismissed Virat Kohli to take his second wicket in two balls . ‘I’m an aggressive bowler and that’s how I got back in the team and I didn’t want to take that away from myself because if I did, I’d just bowl little swingers,’ said Plunkett. ‘But I got my lengths wrong in the first innings. I adjusted second time around and bowled a lot better.’ But Plunkett regretted wasting Saturday afternoon’s opportunity to claim a hat-trick - his third such chance in Tests this season. ‘I guess the lesson is not to bowl a wide one like that,’ said Plunkett. ‘I was just trying to be aggressive but I got my line wrong.’ Plunkett was a member of the Yorkshire attack who conceded 472 in the final innings to a Chris Rogers-inspired Middlesex as they lost a remarkable championship game at Lord’s this season. Lift: Plunkett took two wickets in two balls to keep England in the hunt for a win on day three of the second Test . Salute: Plunkett acknowledges the crowd during his unbeaten 55, which he said he was 'over the moon' with . He was adamant on Saturday night that this pitch will get better for batting as the Test continues. ‘It’s still nipping around but if you get in there are runs to be had,’ said Plunkett. ‘We are willing to chase whatever we need to on this wicket. ‘We’ll come out hard again. If we get a few early ones it’s still a good pitch and still a good cricket wicket. The wicket’s only going to get better so we’ll go hard in the morning and see what happens.’ Cheteshwar Pujara, the first of Plunkett’s victims in those two balls, said India were aiming for a 350 lead but would still fancy their chances if they could set England 300 to win. ‘The bounce is very uneven, a couple are keeping low and others are kicking,’ said Pujara, in a rather different assessment of the third-day pitch to that offered by Plunkett. ‘If we bowl well I’m confident we could defend any total.’ In truth, anything more than 250 will seriously test an England side who have forgotten how to win and a nervous chase is in prospect for Cook and England over the final two days of this Test. Pumped: Plunkett celebrates the wicket of Pujara as he put England in a good position after day three at Lord's .

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Click here for our live scorecard after England v Sri Lanka's second day at Lord's . The cry has been for positive, . proactive cricket at the start of this new Test era and England . responded, at least with the bat, by frolicking in the Lord’s sunshine . yesterday to rattle along to their highest score against Sri Lanka. There . will rarely be better conditions than this but a team who had forgotten . how to score 300, let alone build match-defining totals, made hay while . the sun shone with a formidable 575 for nine. It means realistically . there can only be one winner of this first Investec Test. Paul . Downton set out his stall by making it clear here that winning will not . be enough for Alastair Cook’s side. It must be done with style. Best: Joe Root helped England secure an excellent opening innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's . Top: Root celebrates after reaching a double century of 200 runs not out during the second day's play at Lord's . ‘We want a team that followers are proud of and want to identify with,’ said managing director Downton in the first Test programme. ‘We have to earn that right by playing pro-active cricket. We want to play  winning but positive cricket.’ So far, so good then, with Joe Root reaching an unbeaten double  hundred of some maturity on the second day of the Test summer and England scoring their runs at such a rate that Cook was able to declare well before tea. Sri Lanka ensured it was not all plain sailing for England by then enjoying one of Mick Hunt’s perfect pitches themselves but, at 140 for one, they have much to do if they are to travel to Leeds with this mini-series still all square. Root acknowledges the crowd after England's opening innings on 200 runs not out during the second day's play . It was a reverse-swept four from, of all . people, Jimmy Anderson that took England beyond the 551 for six they . amassed here eight years ago against Sri Lanka. The fact that England . were unable to force a win in that 2006 game, with Andrew Flintoff . bowling himself into the ground, shows there could be three long days . ahead. Yet, a side who were humiliated by Australia will be happy . enough that they passed the first examination of their batting mix of . old and new with a spring in their step. None more so than Root, who . added another hundred to the one he scored on Thursday to become, at 23, . the fourth youngest Englishman to record a double century in Test . cricket. Debut: Chris Jordan bowls during England's second day against Sri Lanka at Lord's . Time to celebrate: Jordan looks as overjoyed as Root did during England's opening innings . High fives: Jordan celebrates taking the wicket of Dimuth Karunaratne in his very first over . England sprang a surprise by asking Gary Ballance to bat at . No 3 here and dropped Root to No 5, where he had made his maiden Test . hundred against New Zealand on his Headingley home ground last summer. Root . looked immediately at home back in the middle order, filling the anchor . role vacated by Jonathan Trott and showing that England will not have . to rely totally on Cook and Ian Bell to provide the right example for . their callow colleagues. Root was able to scamper along at a steady . pace thanks to the support he received, even after Matt Prior and then . Chris Jordan had fallen to Sri Lanka’s fastest bowler in  Shaminda . Eranga and their very own ‘Bodyline’ tactics. The short ball may have . done the trick for Sri Lanka but it had little effect as the second day . wore on, with Stuart Broad, who last week declared his intention to . attack with the bat, flaying a tiring attack that became increasingly . ragged. Dive: Kaushal Silva, who past his half-century, avoids Jordan's bouncer at Lord's . By the time Broad had smacked 47 from 38 balls and Liam . Plunkett, surely England’s best No 10 in years, had added 39, Sri Lanka . were looking as woeful here as England had appeared in the field at . Sydney in the final Ashes Test. Even after scoring 575 in 130 overs . there were some voices in the commentary box claiming England could have . been less conservative, yet they can hardly have done more to fulfil . Downton’s mission statement when Cook declared after Root had reached . his landmark. The last time Root batted at Lord’s he had scored 180 . against Australia and this monumental effort came just a day after his . brother Billy scored a double century of his own for Notts 2nd XI . against Derbyshire. A good week then for this impressive cricketing . family from Sheffield. It was always going to be harder against Sri . Lanka’s batsmen than bowlers but England did not get much luck. Dimuth . Karunaratne was given out lbw to Anderson by Paul Reiffel in the first . over but technology, incredibly, insisted the ball would have gone over . the stumps. Then Prior appeared to catch Kaushal Silva on 39 but the . umpires abdicated responsibility and, after an eternity, TV official . Steve Davis could not be sure the ball carried. But Prior insisted: . ‘I felt it carry. ‘My gloves have got rubber tips in them, and I felt . the ball go right in. There’s no doubt in my mind that it did carry. I’m . disappointed the decision didn’t stand but that’s cricket and we move . on.’ Just as unsatisfactory was the fact that six overs remained . unbowled at the close even after a half-hour extension, an unacceptable . rate with Sri Lanka the principal offenders. At least there was one . positive moment in the field for England when Jordan took the only . wicket to fall with his third ball in Test cricket and celebrated as . joyously as Root had enjoyed his hundreds. New era and two positive, proactive stars for the here and now in Root and Jordan. England can be satisfied with that, even if they struggle to win here.","England declare 575 for 9 from 130.3 overs .

There was plenty of the green, green grass of home that England crave on the Lord’s pitch on Tuesday but whether it will lead to a livelier second Investec Test when battle commences on Thursday remains to be seen. Rarely have 22 yards of turf led to such debate but three moribund surfaces in three Tests this summer, including at the home of cricket when Sri Lanka visited last month, meant all eyes were on groundsman Mick Hunt’s creation on Tuesday. Those eyes included those of ECB’s head of pitches Chris Wood, who spent an hour taking samples from the surface in company with long-serving Hunt and MCC chief executive Derek Brewer as the search for pace and bounce goes on. VIDEO Scroll down for Ballance says England are confident . Getting down to it: Alastair Cook dives in the outfield during England nets on Tuesday at Lord's . Time for action: Alastair Cook and England will be hoping for lively wicket at Lord's on Thursday . Feeling the strain? Alastair Cook is under pressure after a poor summer with the bat . Holding court: Peter Moores addresses his England players during nets at Lord's on Tuesday . Later Alastair Cook, Peter Moores and Paul Downton, England’s managing director, congregated in the middle and it was not difficult to decipher that it was the pitch that was dominating their long conversation. On the surface there appeared plenty of moisture — and the pitch stayed covered for most of the day to retain it — but appearances can be deceptive and Stuart Broad for one remained sceptical about any long overdue signs of life. ‘Looks a little more like English conditions,’ said former England captain Michael Vaughan on Twitter about a very green looking square. ‘It looked like that two days before the Sri Lanka Test,’ replied Broad. ‘The key is Thursday.’ England would be wise to be cynical. The extra grass at the start of the first Test against Sri Lanka here encouraged Angelo Mathews to put England into bat but he then watched them rack up the small matter of 575 for nine. Easy pickings: Joe Root scored an unbeaten 200 against Sri Lanka at Lord's in June . Joy: Joe Root celebrates scoring his century against Sri Lanka on a batting friendly Lord's surface . VIDEO Ballance says England are confident . Conditions got easier and easier for batting as the Test went on, a familiar tale this season, and the famously independent Hunt, MCC’s longest serving employee, is not one to bend to the demands of a frustrated home side. It was left to John Stephenson, MCC’s head of cricket, to insist that Lord’s are doing their all to try to provide both a better surface and better entertainment for another packed house over the next five days. ‘We are just trying to produce the best possible pitch we can,’ said the former Essex and England opener. ‘It’s not an exact science but we are doing our best to make one with carry and bounce. We are going through our normal processes.’ The usually personable Hunt, who has been preparing Lord’s pitches for 30 years, was reluctant to say anything on Tuesday about what might happen here, with Test groundsmen suddenly becoming the unwelcome centre of attention. Taking a break: Ishant Sharma relaxes during India's nets session at Lord's on Tuesday . Praying for more: Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be hoping for a better pitch at Lord's . Close control: Mahendra Singh Dhoni shows off his football skills during training on Tuesday . England are privately livid about conditions that have played into the hands of opponents at a time when they simply cannot catch a break and India could not believe their luck when they saw what had been prepared at Trent Bridge. This is a huge match for England, without a win in nine long Tests, and a captain in Cook who cannot afford the consequences that a combination of defeat here and his 26th failure in succession to hit a Test century might bring. Little more than half the England team were at Lord’s on Tuesday, with a schedule that sees five Tests in six weeks forcing Peter Moores to tell Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Liam Plunkett, Ben Stokes and Matt Prior to put their feet up. Prior would usually have a long wicketkeeping session with Bruce French two days out from a Test but his absence was confirmation that his body is starting to betray him and he needs to prove both fitness and form here. Recalled: Simon Kerrigan is back in the England team after a disappointing debut during the Ashes . Back in the swing: Simon Kerrigan took part in England training at Lord's on Tuesday . Talking tactics: Simon Kerrigan (right) has a word with England assistant coach Paul Farbrace . One man who was at Lord’s was spinner Simon Kerrigan, who continued his rehabilitation after the horrors of his Test debut at the Oval last summer with a long bowl that did little to suggest he is ready to return on Thursday. The inclusion of Kerrigan in England’s 14-man squad is confirmation that he remains next in line in the X factor-like search for a spinner but it would be both a surprise and a major gamble if Cook and Moores threw him in now. Kerrigan had a difficult day bowling for Lancashire against Notts at Liverpool on Monday and his bowling this season has been some way short of the levels that led to his shock call-up for the last Ashes Test in the first place. If England really did want to pick him at Lord’s they would have to either drop a seamer — and that would lead to even more work for Anderson and Broad — or Moeen Ali, a move that would not make sense after the Worcestershire all-rounder’s startlingly good century at Headingley which almost saved England. Bowling options: Moeen Ali and Chris Jordan (right) took part in training on Tuesday . The presence of Kent off-spinner Adam Riley in the nets was proof that Kerrigan is not the only slow bowling option available to England but they would be best advised to persevere with the under-used Moeen’s off-breaks for now. The farcical end to the first Test on a farce of a pitch at Trent Bridge at least appeared to give England another part-time spinning option in the form of Gary Ballance, who delivered a more than acceptable over of leg-spin. ‘I was quite nervous before I bowled because I wasn’t expecting it,’ said Ballance, England’s second highest runscorer this summer behind Joe Root. ‘I was just glad the first one landed and after that I had a bit of confidence. I might get a few more overs in the nets now and we’ll see how we go from there.’ Where England need to go from here is to a victory that would end their worst winless run for more than 20 years but whether the pitch will help them achieve that remains the most sensitive of subjects for everyone involved. Groundsmen in England have become the unwelcome centre of attention this summer after producing three lifeless tracks on the spin (pardon the pun). But what’s the difference between a raging turner and a featherbed? Sportsmail explains all… . GREEN, GREEN GRASS OF HOME . Traditionally in England, groundsmen produce green wickets, i.e. they have a good covering of grass. Grassy pitches lead to more movement off the seam for the faster bowlers. The grass helps James Anderson and Co because deliveries lose very little pace when they hit the deck, as the slick grass lubricates the surface and reduces friction. The ball deviates more readily because the seam bites into the grass while the rest of the ball slides through with little resistance. On an ideal Test wicket, any hint of green should then be burned away by the sun as a match progresses, bringing spinners into play. But this summer, because of a combination of excellent drainage (sucking moisture out of pitches) and groundsmen being encouraged to prepare flat tracks that hardly deteriorate to fill county coffers, England’s speedsters have been given back-breaking surfaces to bowl on which are slow and low, with batsmen’s edges often failing to carry to the slips. FEATHERBEDS . Wickets in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are often prepared without a blade of grass on them. Flat strips of turf which bake under a hot sun are known as 'featherbeds'. These are paradise for batsmen to bat on, but they should eventually deteriorate which brings the bowlers into play. The footmarks created by pacemen bring spinners into the game, while the cracks that appear lead to uneven bounce which benefits quick and slow bowlers. A pitch which spins heavily is often referred to as a “Bunsen”, as in Bunsen burner = raging turner. PACE AND BOUNCE . Pitches in Australia and South Africa are also hard and true but they are nothing like the dead pitches from Asia. The strips at grounds like the Waca (Perth) and the Gabba (Brisbane) have plenty of pace and bounce because of an even covering of grass, a different soil type and a complete absence of moisture. This has Mitchell Johnson and Co licking their lips, and would be much palatable for Anderson and Co than the dead tracks which have been served up this summer.","First Test at Trent Bridge ruined by moribund surface .

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . The somnolent start to India’s tour was rudely interrupted at Grace Road yesterday by an injury scare to one of their most important batsmen. Shikhar Dhawan, the star of India’s Champions Trophy triumph last year, was struck a nasty blow on the arm by the most impressive member of Leicestershire’s second-string attack on an otherwise carefree day of batting. Atif Sheikh, a left-arm seamer of some pace but only one first-class match, kept India’s formidable line-up on their toes and forced Dhawan to retire hurt in this warm-up game when he hit him on the elbow after he had reached 60. Agression: Atif Sheikh, who has only ever played one first class match, was a thorn in the tourists' side . Worry: Shikhar Dhawan receives treatment after being hit on the arm by a Sheikh delivery . Retired hurt: Dhawan left the field after the incident but India insisted his retirement was not forced . India later insisted that Dhawan was fine and was about to retire anyway, in keeping with a practice-game philosophy familiar to observers of India coach Duncan Fletcher’s dismissive approach to tour matches. Yet it was still reminiscent of the incident this time last year when a rapid left-arm bowler in Tymal Mills struck England’s Graeme Swann a nasty blow in a warm-up match at Chelmsford and almost put him out of the Ashes. Only this time it was an opposition player who was undone by friendly fire. Certainly England will not want the flamboyant Dhawan, who smashed 187 off 174 balls on his Test debut against Australia, to arrive at Trent Bridge for the first Test on July 9 with too many runs and form under his belt. To that end Sheikh, who gained considerable pace and movement with the new ball, will have pleased England no end by ruffling Dhawan’s feathers and generally keeping India’s batsmen honest on a day when they cruised to 333-4. Runs: Virat Kohli looked good during his 49-ball stay at the crease, but was bowled for 29 . Solid: Cheteshwar Pujura was one of two players to retire out after making it to a half-century . On the pull: Ajinkya Rahane finished the day 47 not out as Leicestershire caused the tourists few problems . The Nottingham-born left-armer played a single first-class game for Derbyshire before running into disciplinary problems with England Under 19s and then embarking on a nomadic search for a new county that has ended with him trying to establish himself at Grace Road. On this evidence Leicestershire, bottom of Division Two without a victory this season, should give him a go. Other than Sheikh, 23, there was not a lot to trouble an India team who had rendered this opening match non-first-class by insisting on using all 18 members of their squad over the three days, starting with a team of batsmen yesterday. In the circumstances Leicestershire did well to take the wickets they did, with Murali Vijay falling to a catch by Angus Robson, younger brother of Sam, and Virak Kohli being bowled by a beauty from Shiv Thakor. Rare breakthrough: Kohli was bowled by Shiv Thakor playing a loose shot but India dominated . Disappointment: Kohli missed the chance to get some early runs on a tour where India could trouble England . Other than that it was a tale of retirements, with Gautam Gambhir and Cheteshwar Pujara both calling it a day soon after reaching 50 and Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma then helping themselves to some easy runs. India made a bigger splash off the field yesterday when Narayanaswami Srinivasan was confirmed as the first chairman of the International Cricket Council despite being barred from his role as president of the Indian board by the Supreme Court of India. Driving away: Guatam Ghambir plays a good shot as India piled on the runs against Leicestershire . Rising force: Dhawan, who averages almost 50 in his seven tests, looked in good form before getting hurt . The elevation of Srinivasan is part of the controversial ‘power grab’ of the world game by the boards of India, England and Australia and comes even though he has been forced out of power, for now at least, in his home country as part of an investigation into corruption in the Indian Premier League. Moeen Ali, who struck a maiden Test century of high class in a losing cause at Headingley on Tuesday, is the only member of the England team beaten by Sri Lanka who will feature in county cricket ahead of the first Test against India. The other players, including under pressure captain Alastair Cook, will prepare for Trent Bridge in a two-day training camp at Loughborough next Tuesday and Wednesday instead.","India reach 333-4 in tour match against lowly Leicestershire .

The . moment when MCC told him they did not want him to play in their . star-studded bicentenary game at Lord’s in July, as revealed by Charles . Sale in Sportsmail, crystalised  Flintoff’s determination to come back. ‘John . Stephenson from MCC phoned me and I thought it was to tell me where to . turn up and who else would be in the side,’ said Flintoff in a BBC Radio . 5 Live interview. ‘My kids were in the car and he told me he didn’t . want me.

'They’re all 10 years older than me and they haven’t played for . years”. I saw my kids’ faces and it was the first time they’d seen . their dad told he couldn’t do something.

I’d sooner have a go and have it not come off than sit at home . for the rest of my days thinking, “I should have tried it, I should have . had a go”. I don’t live my life like that.’ Flintoff, whose . friendship with Lancashire captain and interim coach Glen Chapple . facilitated the move, admitted his return to the nets has not been pain . free. ‘When I’m bowling it still hurts a bit,’ he said. ‘But I’m loving . running in and if I can take that into a game I might be dangerous. ‘I . don’t want this to be one year.

Paul Downton was forced to apologise . to Kevin Pietersen on Friday night when lawyers decided that the . managing director had breached the confidentiality agreement reached . when England sacked their maverick star. Downton . had provided the most detailed and welcome explanation yet behind the . decision to sever ties with Pietersen after the Ashes disaster in an . interview last week with Jonathan Agnew on BBC’s Test Match Special. Hitting back: Kevin Pietersen rejected Paul Downton's claims made on Test Match Special . Hitting out: Pietersen was criticised for his 'irresponsible' batting style during the Ashes series in Australia . Yet his claims that Pietersen was ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the Sydney Test in January and that all senior players and management agreed with the sacking incurred the wrath of the player and his lawyers who have been engaged in talks with the ECB’s legal team over the last week. Those talks ended with Downton issuing an apology for talking about the matter but not for what he said. It is another blow to the ECB, who have been outmanoeuvred by Pietersen in the PR stakes despite having justifiable reasons for the sacking. It will also be frustrating for senior players and coaches who want the full story made public as soon as possible. And the fact that Pietersen has regularly appeared to breach the confidentiality agreement himself through comments made via his voluble mouthpiece Piers Morgan does not seem to have been taken into account. What is clear is that both sides should . have been allowed to have their say at the time, rather than leaving . frustrated supporters in the dark. Tough talking: ECB managing director Paul Downton (left) and BBC Test Match Special commentator Jonathan Agnew (right) Outcast: New England coach Peter Moores could not find any support among senior players for Pietersen . Meanwhile, after the twin . imposters of Durham disaster and Old Trafford triumph, England will go . in search of consistency at Lord’s on Saturday when they look to clinch a . one-day series that would provide a significant boost for them. Three . one-sided matches in the Royal London series see England 2-1 up with . two to play and determined to repeat the positive cricket which saw them . recover from being skittled for 99 in the North East to blast Sri Lanka . out for 67 under Manchester’s leaden skies on Wednesday. The sun . may finally shine on the tourists at Lord’s today which could provide a . more level playing field and a test of the methods which England insist . they will employ all the way to the World Cup next February in 50-over . cricket. ‘We’ve tried to learn from what has gone on and we want to . produce the brand of cricket we saw at Old Trafford again and again . now,’ said spinner James Tredwell. ‘That’s the focus. There’s not a lot . of time left until the World Cup and, win or lose, we want to do the . things that we think will stand us in good stead in that tournament.’ England . have seemed a seamer short in these recent matches, although that . problem should be addressed when Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes return to . the one-day side.

But the question now is whether he can emulate Luis Suarez and earn the right to be mentioned in the same breath as others who have worn Liverpool's iconic number seven. The Uruguayan, for all his unsavoury antics, produced some phenomenal performances for Liverpool, culminating in his Player of the Year awards last season. So who else makes our list of Liverpool's greatest number sevens? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rodgers hail Suarez as one of the best strikers in the world . New man: Rickie Lambert could be about to take on the number 7 shirt at Anfield from Luis Suarez . Striking power: Lambert showed his goalscoring ability at Southampton and will want to emulate Suarez . Kevin Keegan 1971-1977 . The first of Liverpool's great sevens, and the man who made the number special. Keegan was signed in 1971, and formed a lethal strike partnership with John Toshak before moving to Hamburg in 1977. In his six years at the club Keegan won the league three times, scored over 100 goals, and led Liverpool to the European Cup. His first goal came 12 minutes into his debut. His last match sealed the European title for the club. For the early 1970s he was the iconic leader of Liverpool's line and still considered by many to be their greatest striker. Keegan would go on to be the first English winner of the Ballon D'or since Bobby Charlton, receiving the award in 1978 and '79. Celebration: Keegan scored over 100 times in his six seasons with Liverpool, the first great number seven . Champion: Keegan (centre) celebrates winning the European Cup in his final game with boss Bob Paisley (right) Kenny Dalglish 1977-1987 . Filling the hole left behind by Keegan's move to Hamburg was never going to be easy, but Kenny Dalglish's arrival from Celtic did just that. Possibly Liverpool's greatest ever player, Dalglish played over 500 times for the club scoring 169 goals. At the end of his first season with the club King Kenny scored the only goal in the European Cup final, and his decade playing for the club produced six league titles. As both a player and a manager Dalglish was a Liverpool hero, and ensured the legend of the number seven lived on. King Kenny: During his time as a player and a manager Liverpool won nine league titles . Legend: Dalglish holds aloft the trophy after winning yet another championship with the club . Peter Beardsley 1987-1991 . A similar type of player to Dalglish, although rarely mentioned with the same expressions of awe by Liverpool fans. Two titles in his four years at the club was an excellent return, and his first season on Merseyside saw him play an important part in one of the great Liverpool sides. Title winner: Beardsley (right) celebrates the 1990 title, Liverpool's last, with John Barnes . Another great goal: Keegan fires in a low strike for Liverpool against rivals Everton . He was denied the European glory of his predecessors by the ban on English clubs from European football, but Beardsley deserves to be remembered as part of the number 7 tradition. Steve McManaman 1990-1999 . The only man on this list to have come through the Liverpool youth system to wear the number seven shirt, Mcmanaman was a key member of the squad throughout the 1990s. While he may not match the likes of Keegan and Dalglish in terms of trophies, McManaman provided pace and flair in a team far below the standard of the previous decades. Dribbler: McManaman brought flair to the declining Liverpool side of the 1990s . His successes for Liverpool, more often as a provider than a goalscorer, earned a move to Real Madrid . The winger was never really able to throw off his 'Spice Boys' tag as the Liverpool team in the mid-90s grew a reputation for the wrong reasons, but on the pitch he was a star for the right reasons. Goals and assists were plentiful, and earned him a move to Real Madrid, where he scored in the 2000 Champions League final. His 142 assists in his nine years for Liverpool remains a remarkable statistic, and he was always more the supplier than the goalscorer. Gone: Suarez has completed his £75m move to Barcelona after a superb season for Liverpool . 1971-1977 Kevin Keegan1977-1987 Kenny Dalglish1987-1989 Nigel Spackman1987-1989 John Aldridge1987-1991 Peter Beardsley1991          David Speedie1991-1992 Dean Saunders1993-1996 Nigel Clough1990-1999 Steve McManaman1999-2005 Vladimir Smicer2003-2008 Harry Kewell2008-2009 Robbie Keane2009-2010 Vacant2011-2014 Luis Suarez2014-         Rickie Lambert . Luis Suarez 2011-2014 . The first player in . Premier League history to claim three hat-tricks against the same club . when he scored a treble against Norwich in December 2013, Suarez has come the closest to making the duo of Keegan and Dalglish a trinity. The previous wearers of the red cloth did not provoke anywhere near the controversy that has followed the forward around. Racist abuse, the biting incidents and the on-off transfer saga have all added spice to the story. Now that he has departed to Barcelona, his time at Liverpool can be fully evaluated. Free-kicks that fizz into the net, little chips over the goalkeeper...for the neutral it has been a privilege to witness - on the pitch at least. The . only thing is, Messers Keegan and Dalglish carry the mantle of . greatness because of a level of brilliance that was sustained over a . number of years. Happier times: Suarez propelled Liverpool to within touching distance of their first Premier League title . Controversy: Suarez's antics, and his relatively short spell, mean he will not be remembered as the greatest number seven, but on the pitch he earned the right to be mentioned alongside Keegan and Dalglish . World Class: Suarez's performances last season led to comparisons with Ronaldo and Messi . That longevity is something that the most recent incumbent chose not to replicate. His . move means that Suarez will never achieve the long-term success of . those two greats, but his contribution since 2011 suggests he is . certainly able to be mentioned in the same breath. And, given the achievements and contribution made by both Keegan and Dalglish, that's surely high praise indeed.","Lambert likely to be Liverpool's new number seven shirt .

Samuel See died on Sunday morning at the Union Avenue detention facility in Connecticut just hours after he was arrested following a domestic dispute with his estranged husband. New Haven Independent reported See, who was on leave from Yale, did not hang himself and showed no signs of committing suicide. Days after his tragic death, it has emerged that See's personal details were posted on various escort websites.

'It's given us a training facility where all the players are saying, 'Wow, this is some training ground now'. It's one of the best.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Jaya Narain . A British teenager and her American boyfriend gunned down a US police officer in Florida before turning the weapon on themselves minutes later, police say. Alexandria Hollinghurst, 17, and Brandon Goode, 18, were stopped by a police officer as they walked down a street in a wealthy residential suburb of Orlando, Florida in the early hours of Saturday morning. Police Officer Robert German encountered the pair while on a routine foot patrol and immediately called for back-up after deeming them suspicious. But when back-up police arrived on the scene, they found the officer had been shot and was lying fatally injured in the road with the teenagers nowhere to be seen. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Alex Hollinghurst died early Saturday morning - officials say by suicide, but family and friends say she was murdered . According to U.S. police chiefs, the officers then had to run for cover as at least two gunshots went off about one block away. A search was carried out and they found the teenagers dead from apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the grounds of multi-million dollar home. The dead officer was wearing a body camera. U.S. authorities said it appeared both Goode and Hollinghurst - known as Alex - had committed suicide, but her family believes she may have been murdered by her boyfriend. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said last night: 'It appears they likely committed suicide.' Last night a major investigation was under way into the deaths, but it is believed Hollinghurst originally came from Oldham, Greater Manchester, and her family had emigrated to the U.S. about six years ago. Former neighbours of the couple have spoken of their shock. Locals in the village of Hadfield, Derbyshire, said Alexandria has a sister, Hannah, who is two or three years younger, and an older stepsister, Georgia, who is about 25 or 26 but did not live with the family. The girls' parents were known as Tom and Debra Jane, or just Jane. The current occupant of their old house, an end-terrace, said the property was re-possessed, then the family moved to the US, with letters arriving for them always addressed to Tom or Jane. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said Mr Hollinghurst was involved in a concrete or building business before they emigrated and added: 'I'm really shocked, I hadn't heard anything about this.' Another neighbour was visibly shaken, saying: 'I'm too shocked to talk at the moment. I can't believe what's happened.' Fallen hero: Officer Robert German (left) was shot and killed early Saturday after stopping Brandon Goode (right) and Alexandria Hollinghurst before calling for backup . Andrew Cartledge, headteacher of St Andrew's C.E Junior School, in Hadfield, Derbyshire, paid tribute to Alex. He told ITV News: 'She was with us until the age of 11. 'She was an able pupil, sociable, with a lot of friends. Our thoughts are with her and her family.' Grace Etchells, who went to primary school with Alex also paid tribute to her on Twitter. She . wrote: 'So horrible knowing a very close friend from primary Alex . Hollinghurst sadly got taken from us in such horrific circumstances. RIP . lovely xx.' Ms Etchells, . who was also a former classmate of the teenager, said: 'I knew Alex from . primary school - St Andrew's Church Of England Junior School - up until . about six years ago. 'That is when Alex, Hannah (her younger sister) and her mum and dad left for the USA. 'We were classmates for about three years. 'She was a great girl - she had zero flaws.' Sheriff’s investigators said they would analyze any images retrieved from the device. German came across the pair while conducting foot patrols Saturday morning, in the same exclusive gated community that Tiger Woods and ex-wife Elin Nordegren previously had a home, and immediately called for backup. 'The deputy knew he had a suspicious set of circumstances, so he called for backup,' said Demings, in footage of the press conference shown by WESH. Officers from Apopka, Orlando and two sheriff's deputies soon arrived and were forced to take cover as the additional gunshots shattered the predawn silence. 'They heard gunfire in the background,' Demings continued. 'They went up and used the police vehicles to shield themselves and the officer,' The officers held their ground until Orange County Fire and Rescue arrived to take German to a local hospital. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful, he was soon pronounced dead at Orlando Regional Medical Center, said Demings. Devastated: Hollinghurst's younger sister's Facebook profile is filled with images of the two girls smiling and making silly faces . A terrible loss: Tara Boers (right) wrote on Facebook that German (left) was the 'greatest' man she's ever known, and that she and her daughter 'will love him forever' Cut short: Hollinghurst had a seemingly bright future, she graduated high school an entire year early . Officers on the scene made their way towards where they thought they heard gunshots as the ambulance sped away. Demings said they conducted a perimeter patrol and soon found the pair on the grounds of a multimillion dollar home, both from nearby Davenport, dead of apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds. 'The two suspects were found very close to where Officer German was shot,' Demings explained. 'It appears to be that both suspects, a male and female, died from self-inflicted gun shot wounds.' Goode was arrested only a few weeks ago for marijuana possession, alcohol possession by a minor and for having drug paraphernalia - all were first time offenses, records showed. He resolved those charges without going to prison last Thursday when he was accepted into a pre-trial diversion program - undertaking treatment for addiction. Too young: Police vowed to get to the bottom of this 'senseless' tragedy, but are working under the assumption the two teens died of mutual suicide . Popular: Hollinghurst's Facebook is also chock full of pictures of her with friends . The only police record involving Hollinghurst was a three-car pileup where she was not believed to be at fault. An investigation into the 'senseless tragedy' of the five-year-veteran's death is ongoing, Windermere Police Chief David Ogden said at the same press conference. All evidence - including German's lapel cam footage showing his encounter with the two individuals - has been turned over to the OCSO, he added. Hollinghurst's family and friends insist on social media that she was murdered, that her death was not a suicide. 'I have friends whose daughter was murdered this morning in Florida,' a family friend wrote on Facebook. 'She was only 17... they think her boyfriend killed her.' Multiple MailOnline messages left with the OCSO seeking further comment, including whether or not Goode could possibly have killed both German and Hollinghurst before turning the gun on himself, have not been returned. Roped off: Officers cordoned off the area where the shootings are said to have taken place . Mystery: Police say they found a male and female, both white and in their early 20s, dead in brush on the property of this home - they are believed to have committed suicide . Several people have expressed overwhelming sadness over the death of one of only 12 full time officers in the town of about 2,000. 'Windermere's heart is broken,' said Mayor Gary Bruhn. 'Robbie was one of the greatest men I have ever known,' Tara Boers wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to German. 'He loved being a police officer even knowing the risks involved. My daughter and I feel such loss today and will love him forever.' A childhood neighbor of the fallen officer told WFTV he remembers the day Windermere Police canvassed the neighborhood for character references shortly before he joined the department, he was shocked to hear German had been shot to death. 'Officer German was a good cop, he was one of the finest police officers that we had in this agency,' said Ogden, adding he had just returned to foot patrols this week after months behing a desk while rehabbing after shoulder surgery. Solemn remembrance: An individual is shown Saturday bringing flowers to the Windermere Police Department . Piecing it together: An investigator is shown Saturday taking a picture of a handgun recovered from the scene, it is not yet known whose firearm it is . 'This is such a nice safe area,' a local told News 13, 'it is unbelievable that this would happen.' Several other people told local media the incident was shocking, and a terrible tragedy. German's death follows the murder of Orange County Deputy Jonathan Scott Pine, 34, by only six weeks. Pine was shot to death while investigating car burglaries just a mile from where German was shot. Police Chief David Ogden echoed that sentiment, noting: 'Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers are with Officer German's family during this difficult time.' German attended Lake Mary High School, then studied at the Seminole State College police academy. He is survived by his mother and father.","Windermere Police Officer Robert German, 31, was shot dead early on Saturday morning .

"By . Andrew Levy . Peter Trythall, headteacher of Stanbridge Earls School in Hampshire . A mixed boarding school is being investigated by police over claims that at least ten girls were sexually abused by other pupils. The allegations emerged during a tribunal which heard that a 15-year-old autistic girl was groomed and raped at Stanbridge Earls School in Romsey, Hampshire. The victim’s mother claims there was a ‘predatory ring’ and said behaviour among children was ‘like something out of Lord of the Flies’. It was also alleged that a 12-year-old . girl was stripped naked by five pupils and, on another occasion, . assaulted in woodland. The claims of abuse at the school, which . specialises in helping children with learning difficulties and where . fees are up to £39,000 a year, were revealed at a Special Educational . Needs and Disability Tribunal. It criticised ‘systemic failures’ and . voiced ‘grave concerns about safeguarding’ of children. It awarded . £86,000 to the parents of the 15-year-old, now 17, who cannot be named . for legal reasons. The tribunal heard that the girl was assaulted by a boy in June 2011. She was taken to a GP but her parents were not told. Two weeks later she said she had been . raped. Texts between the girl and male pupils were obvious attempts to . groom her, the tribunal ruled. She had been persuaded to send naked . photos of herself to boys, it was claimed. However, the messages were . dismissed by Stanbridge Earls headmaster Peter Trythall as ‘normal texts . for children of this age’. The girl’s mother said: ‘The fact that . our daughter was not the only vulnerable underage girl subject to . sexual contact and sexual intercourse was, and is, shocking. 'It has . taken 18 months and £150,000 in legal costs for us to be listened to.’ The family’s solicitor said tribunal evidence suggested more than ten girls had been abused. The mother of the 12-year-old, now 14, . who also cannot be named, said the girl had since been diagnosed with . post-traumatic stress disorder. Police are investigating allegations that at least two girls were raped or sexually abused by pupils at Stanbridge Earls school, in Hampshire . The tribunal’s findings have been sent . to Education Secretary Michael Gove, who is considering the school’s . future. Hampshire Police confirmed that officers are investigating the . allegations. Stanbridge Earls, which has 200 pupils . aged ten to 19, said the tribunal case was ‘in no way illustrative of . the way the school normally meets the needs of its pupils’. It added: . ‘The school has submitted a detailed action plan concerning how it is . remedying issues.’ The Department for Education said: . ‘These allegations are deeply disturbing. We are in close touch with the . parents and the school and are working closely with the local authority . to make sure children are safe at the school.'

"By . James Chapman . Caught napping: Within hours of Liberal Democrat Mike Thornton being chosen to fight Chris Huhne¿s Eastleigh constituency, this 2011 photograph emerged of him apparently asleep on the job. For a man struggling to retain a parliamentary seat vacated by a shamed colleague, it was perhaps not the best of starts. Within hours of Liberal Democrat Mike Thornton being chosen to fight disgraced ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne’s Eastleigh constituency, a photograph emerged of him apparently asleep on the job. The picture, which seems to show Mr Thornton nodding off, was taken at a council meeting in 2011. As that photograph was gleefully . circulated by opponents, the local Lib Dems moved quickly to delete from . their website pictures they deemed far more damaging – showing the . councillor with Mr Huhne, who quit Parliament after admitting he lied to . police to escape a driving ban. Mr Thornton, married with a 19-year-old daughter, faces a challenge from a Tory described as her party’s ‘answer to Sarah Palin’. Maria Hutchings has been likened to the controversial US Republican politician because of her robust views on issues such as gay marriage and immigration, which potentially put her at odds with Conservative leadership. Mrs Hutchings, a mother of four, rose to national prominence in 2005 when she ‘handbagged’ Tony Blair on live TV over cuts to special schools. One of her sons is autistic. Mr Thornton said yesterday he was ‘puzzled’ by his rival’s campaign tactics, condemning her opposition to gay marriage. He said: ‘I’m surprised she hasn’t been co-opted by UKIP.’ Polls suggest the by-election on February 28 will be close. A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday put the Lib Dems on 36 per cent, ahead of the Tories on 33 per cent, with UKIP on 16 per cent – suggesting the anti-EU party could deprive the Tories of victory – and Labour on 13 per cent. However, a poll last week gave the Conservatives a three-point lead. Mr Huhne held Eastleigh at the 2010 election with a 3,864 majority. The by-election will put the Coalition . under immense strain, with the Tories going all out to snatch the seat . from their Lib Dem partners. Deputy . Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who will visit the Hampshire constituency . today, has revealed that he and David Cameron are not co-ordinating . their diaries and could therefore end up campaigning in Eastleigh at the . same time. Rival: Conservative candidate Maria Hutchings has been described as the Tory's answer to Sarah Palin because of her robust views on issues such as gay marriage and immigration . A Tory victory . would be a shattering blow to Mr Clegg, and the first by-election gain . for a Prime Minister since Margaret Thatcher at the height of her . Falklands popularity. Mr Clegg urged people not to cast . their vote based on the ‘courtroom drama’ involving Mr Huhne but he . conceded it is an issue. He said: ‘I’ve heard lots of people say they . don’t like what’s happening in the court, but they actually think that . what he did as a local MP was the model of a Liberal Democrat working . hard for the local community.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable, said . he was confident of a Lib Dem victory, with the by-election a good . chance to highlight differences with the Tories. But . he risked angering his Coalition partners by revealing that the Lib . Dems are in talks with Labour on long-term plans for pensions and . industrial strategy. That will be seen as another indication that Mr Cable is ready to seek a deal with Labour after the 2015 General Election. Tory . former Cabinet minister Liam Fox said the Lib Dems had a ‘problem with . trust’ over student tuition fees, an EU referendum and the blocking of a . bid to make constituency boundaries fairer. Shamed: The by-election is being held to replaced ex-Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne who resigned from his seat in Eastleigh, Hants., after admitting that he lied to police to escape a driving ban .","Photograph from 2011 shows Mike Thornton apparently sleeping in meeting .

"By . Ted Thornhill . These days we communicate most of the time by email and text, receive statements online and fax machines are already a thing of the past – yet global paper consumption since 1980 has gone up by almost half. The worst offenders are the Belgians, with the equivalent of 8.51 40-foot trees worth of paper being consumed by each member of the population per year, according to The Economist. The magazine points out, however, that its position at the top of the tree-consumption tree is partly down to the EU headquarters being there, which prints vast amounts of paperwork in countless languages. Wood you believe it? Belgium uses more than eight trees-worth of paper per person per year . The No2 spot is filled by Finland, which apparently does convert a lot of its paper into domestic packaging, thereby distorting its tree consumption. The top next three worst offenders are Germany, Japan and Sweden  - despite all three having technology-driven economies. The rest of the top 10 is made up of the U.S, Denmark, Switzerland, Netherlands, South Korea and Canada. The UK comes in at No11, with each member of society using the equivalent of 4.48 trees. Next in the chart comes France, Spain, Portugla, Ireland and China, which only uses 1.81 trees per person. Azerbaijan is the most tree-friendly nation, with only 0.16 trees per person being used each year. Paper recycling is certainly something that the UK population feels strongly about with a marked increase in the amount recovered per household since 1997.","The biggest paper consumer in the world is Belgium, thanks to EU bureaucracy ."
"By . Emma Glanfield . London's new £4.2billion 'super sewer' will stop the capital returning to the days of the 'Great Stink' but could see household bills rise by £80, it has been revealed. The 15-mile Thames Tideway Tunnel, estimated to cost nearly half of the 2012 Olympics, will take 10 years to build and will be the biggest infrastructure project ever undertaken by the UK water industry. It will stretch all the way from Acton in West London, along the general path of the River Thames, towards Limehouse where it will veer north-east to Abbey Mills Pumping Station near Stratford. The 15-mile Thames Tideway Tunnel, estimated to cost nearly half of the 2012 Olympics, will take 10 years to build and will be the biggest infrastructure project ever undertaken by the UK water industry. It is said to be needed to help prevent an average of 55million tonnes of untreated sewage being discharged into the river each year . The 'super-sewer' will stretch all the way from Acton in West London, along the general path of the River Thames, towards Limehouse where it will veer north-east to Abbey Mills Pumping Station near Stratford . Situated 65 metres below the river, and with a capacity of 1.6million cubic metres, the sewer is said to be needed to prevent an average of 55million tonnes of untreated sewage being discharged into the river each year. Thames Water has insisted the multi-billion pound project is crucial to stop London returning to the days of the 'Great Stink' when the river acted as an open sewer. At the time, in the mid-1880s, residents complained of the smell from the river which was full of raw sewage. The problem was eventually solved by engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, who built a 1,300 mile network of Victorian sewers to stop untreated sewage being pumped into the Thames. But, while they have worked well for more than 150 years, Thames Tideway Tunnel Ltd has now submitted plans for a new system to help combat the rising amount of sewage which overflows from the sewers every year. Exploratory works for the £4.2billion project have already been carried out in the River Thames. Construction could get underway as early as 2016 if given the go-ahead . Thames Water has insisted the multi-billion pound project is crucial to stop London returning to the days of the 'Great Stink' when the river acted as an open sewer . Built from three main construction sites in Fulham, Battersea and Southwark, the Thames Tideway Tunnel is expected to help treat some of the 55million tonnes of 'overflow' raw sewage which the current system cannot cope with. The new system, if given the official go ahead, will intercept the sewage before it enters the river and carefully treat it before pumping it back into the water in East London. Preparatory construction work could potentially start as early as next year if plans are given the go-ahead – but it will come at a price. British engineer Sir Joseph William Bazalgette (standing top right) built London's current drainage system in the 1860's, but his sewers are now starting to overflow . Thames Water estimates that household bills will have to rise by £80 a year to finance the sewer, The Independent reported. However, while regulators have questioned the cost of the 'super-sewer', Sir Peter Bazalgette, the great-great-grandson of Sir Joseph, said he supports public investment into the project. He told the newspaper: 'These major public works need to be done.' If given the green light, preparatory work is expected to begin next year before full construction starts in 2016. The project has a targeted completion date of 2023.","The 15-mile Thames Tideway Tunnel is expected to cost nearly half of the 2012 Olympics and will take 10 years to build .

Chloe Glasson, 14, from Fife falls asleep without warning between 25 and 30 times a day. Chloe had the Pandemrix jab in November 2009 and started suffering the symptoms of narcolepsy just four months later. Chloe Glasson (pictured with her mother, Rebecca), 14, developed narcolepsy after having the swine flu vaccine. She now falls asleep up to 30 times a day and suffers extreme mood swings and scary, vivid dreams . Campaigners believe she is one of dozens of youngsters across the UK who developed the condition after having the vaccine. The government recently admitted for the first time that the injections can trigger narcolepsy in some cases. It is believed ministers will announce on Friday that tests are to begin on sufferers to see if they qualify for compensation. Chloe's case is so severe that her family, from Kirkcaldy, are convinced the government will be forced to pay compensation. Chloe said: ‘What hurts the most is when people see me in public and I'm starting to fall asleep and they look at me as if I'm drunk or have been taking drugs. ‘I am no different to anyone else in that I have still got feelings and I can see the way they are looking at me. Chloe can no longer take public transport by herself, go swimming or have a bath. She has also had to drop two subjects at school as she couldn't keep up with the workload . ‘I have still got hopes and dreams. I want to be a drama teacher when I'm older but I've really just got to take every day as it comes.’ Chloe says she also suffers mood swings and disturbing dreams as a result of her condition. She said: ‘The emotions I feel are so extreme, I can go from being really happy and chatty to really annoyed to really upset in a few seconds and all it takes is one little thing to set it off. ‘The dreams I have when I'm asleep are really vivid, I can feel the pain in the dream and sometimes it even feels like someone is touching me, it's really terrifying.’ Chloe (pictured with her mother, Rebecca) is hoping to receive a £120,000 compensation payout from the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme . Chloe has already to drop two subjects at school because she cannot keep up with the workload. She said: ‘When I go into auto pilot behaviour I don't really remember anything that happens, and luckily I've never been really hurt.’ Chloe, who was officially diagnosed with narcolepsy and catalepsy in December last year, added: ‘It can happen at any time. ‘Like standing up or sitting down. I've really been lucky that I've not hurt myself falling asleep while standing up and I ask myself everyday how I've managed. ‘At school I'll be sitting at my desk and this wave of tiredness takes over. Then you're eyes start to roll and droop and that's when you know what's about to happen. You just go out. Chloe (pictured before her illness) said: 'What hurts the most is when people see me in public and I'm starting to fall asleep and they look at me as if I'm drunk or have been taking drugs' ‘It’s like a rollercoaster of emotions sometimes and at first it was really embarrassing. ‘No one really got what was going on so they would kind of laugh about it. Even the teachers joined in at first. I've been reduced to tears so many times.’ Chloe’s mother, Rebecca, said: ‘It's just frustrating that it's taken them this long to admit there is a link. ‘Almost everyone involved knew that was the case and we're just trying to prove it. You just start to blame yourself.’ She added: ‘Chloe had to get the vaccine because she is asthmatic but now she's left with this condition for the rest of her life. The UK Government recently admitted that the Pandemrix jab could be to blame in certain cases of narcolepsy . ‘The scariest moment so far was when Chloe went missing for over two hours. She was meant to meet my mum in town but went into an automatic behaviour state and disappeared. ‘We were all frantic with worry and I had to call the police.’ Ms Glasson said the falling asleep was not even the biggest problem. Chloe now also suffers from the debilitating muscle condition cataplexy. Ms Glasson said: ‘Her cataplexy means she can collapse at any time and there is so many day to day things that we take for granted that she can't do. It is thought that for every 55,000 children who were given the injection, one has developed narcolepsy . ‘No bubble bath, no swimming and she . can't even use public transport on her own. She fell asleep on a bus . once and ended up miles away. ‘For us it’s not just about the compensation, it’s about making Chloe's life better. We want people to realise what she's dealing with and to help make her feel more accepted. ‘Chloe is a really, really bright kid and she loves drama and art but it’s really unfair that she has had to drop two subjects. ‘It's been life changing for Chloe and the rest of the family.’ Since 2011 the vaccine has not been given to people under the age of 20 because of the risk of narcolepsy . The UK Government recently admitted that the Pandemrix jab could be to blame in certain cases of narcolepsy. Families will get £120,000 through the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme if they can prove 'severe' disability. Narcolepsy, which occurs in one in every 2,000 people, is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times. It is a long-term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns. Symptoms include, sleep attacks, daytime sleepiness and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion. It is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease, they attack healthy cells. In the case of narcolepsy, antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep-regulating chemical. There is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed, for example, by taking regular naps, eating healthily and exercising. In some cases, medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help. It is thought that for every 55,000 children who were given the jab, Pandemrix, one has developed narcolepsy. Researchers, who published their findings in the British Medical Journal, studied 75 children with narcolepsy and found that 11 of these had received the vaccine before their symptoms began. The vaccine is associated with a 14-fold increase in a child's risk of developing the condition. Since 2011, the Department of Health has prevented the use of Pandemrix in people under the age of 20. It is thought that for every 55,000 children who were given the injection, one has developed narcolepsy. Researchers, . who published their findings in the British Medical Journal, studied 75 . children with narcolepsy and found that 11 of these had received the . vaccine before their symptoms began. Since 2011 it has not been given to people under the age of 20 because of the risk of narcolepsy. The UK Health Protection Agency has found that giving the jab to young children increases their chance of developing narcolepsy by 14 times. Narcolepsy affects the brain's ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle, causing excessive sleepiness throughout the day. The long term neurological condition can cause sleep attacks, daytime sleepiness and, in some cases, cataplexy. There is no cure for narcolepsy but medication is available to help manage the symptoms, which cause side effects such as nausea, hallucinations and headaches. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions confirmed they had written to four families previously rejected for compensation inviting them to reapply. Saying individual cases could not be discussed, he added: ‘The Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme provides support in the very rare cases where someone becomes severely disabled as a result of a vaccination. ‘Decisions on vaccine damage payments claims take into account the individual circumstances of each case and the latest available accepted medical evidence. ‘DWP has looked at some vaccine damage payments cases again in light of new information regarding swine flu and narcolepsy provided by the Department for Health. ‘Once this new information was taken into account it was decided, on balance of probability, in some cases that causation was proved.’","Chloe Glasson became narcoleptic four months after having Pandemrix jab .

"By . Jill Reilly . Oscar Pistorius is to sell the luxury mansion house where he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp to raise money for his legal bills. His lawyer Brian Webber said in a statement today that it had 'become necessary' for Pistorius to sell the villa in a gated community in Pretoria because his ongoing murder trial will go beyond the expected three-week duration. Webber added that the 27-year-old Paralympic has never returned to the upmarket £278,000 ($458,000) house since he fatally shot Steenkamp in an upstairs bathroom in the pre-dawn hours of February 14 last year. Oscar Pistorius is to sell the luxury mansion house where he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp to raise money for his legal bills. Pictured: Pistorius at his house in Pretoria in 2012 . Scene: Pistorius shot Miss Steenkamp through the bathroom door at his home (above) in Pretoria in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year . Webber says Pistorius 'cannot contemplate ever returning to live there again' - since the shooting he has been living at his uncle's house in Pretoria. He said the Olympian's home has remained 'sealed' since it was handed back by police over a year ago. Estate agent Ansie Louw, who is handling the sale, told MailOnline the house will be sold in a closed bid which started today at five million rand (£278,000) and will be open until 21st March. She said the process was unusual due to the situation: 'We were not allowed to take photos or put it onto our website. If they do open it they attract lots of people just interested in the case and it will be chaos.' Webber says Pistorius 'cannot contemplate ever returning to live there again' Ms Louw said that although the home had been a crime scene it would still attract interest. 'It is not normal circumstances. It is not a normal process. But you know what some people say it doesn't both them.' She told MailOnline there has already been interest in the home from one overseas buyer and explained that potential buyers need to email an address, put down a $5,000 deposit and sign an agreement before they are sent photos and plans of the whitewash house. The deposit is returned if their bid is unsuccessful. The final decision about who buys the home will be made by Pistorius' attorneys and Ms Louw said 'because it is a closed bid the buyer needs to be a cash buyer' and the new owners would be able to move into the house by April. Not listening: Oscar Pistorius appeared to place his thumbs in his ears as ballistic evidence about his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp's gunshot wounds are described to the court yesterday . Family support: Pistorius hugs his sister Aimee (pictured right) during his trial at the High Court in Pretoria . Pistorius valued the house at five million rand during his bail application in February last year. At . the time he also owned two other houses with a combined value of 1.5 . million rand in Pretoria and a vacant plot worth 1.6 million rand in . Cape Town. All his properties together were worth 8.3 million rand, the sporting hero told the court. Since the shooting he lost many of the endorsement deals that earned him some £300,000  ($510,000) a year. The athlete has been paying his own legal fees since the shooting, according to the statement. The . costs - reportedly as high as £5,000 ($9,000) a day - are said to include at . least three full-time lawyers in court, ballistics and forensics experts . as well as an American crime scene reconstruction company. Yesterday . a court in Pretoria heard Steenkamp was standing in a toilet cubicle . and facing the closed door when she was hit in the right hip by the . first of four bullets that he fired, a police ballistics expert . testified Wednesday at the double-amputee runner's murder trial. Steenkamp fell back onto a magazine holder in the cubicle and crossed her arms over her head to protect herself, said Capt. Christiaan Mangena. The second bullet missed Steenkamp and ricocheted off the wall and broke into fragments, bruising her back, he said. Steenkamp was then hit in her right arm and in the head by the third and fourth shots fired by Pistorius with his 9 mm pistol, he said. She collapsed with her head on the toilet seat, Mangena said. Back in court: June Steenkamp, mother of Reeva Steenkamp, left, sits next to African National Congress Women's League spokesperson Jackie Mofokeng, right, as details of her daughter's death are described to the court . Questioning: State prosecutor Gerrie Nel questions ballistics experts Captain Christiaan Mangena over how Ms Steenkamp was killed . Pistorius is charged with . premeditated murder and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted. He says he shot . Steenkamp, 29, by mistake through a locked door in his bathroom because . he thought she was a dangerous nighttime intruder. Pistorius . says Steenkamp went to use the toilet during the night without him . knowing, but prosecutors charge he killed her after a loud argument that . caused her to flee and hide in the toilet area. Neighbors have testified to hearing loud screaming before and during the shots being fired. Mangena, the ballistics expert, concluded that one of the final two bullets fired by Pistorius went through Steenkamp's left hand, which she held over her head, before it penetrated her skull. The policeman said he couldn't determine the order of the last two shots. As Mangena threw his hands up to cover his head in court to re-enact Steenkamp's cowering position, and described details of the head wound, Pistorius put his fingers in his ears in an apparent attempt to block out the testimony. June Steenkamp, Reeva's mother, was in the courtroom and occasionally glanced at photos of the bloody scene of her daughter's shooting. Mangena said the bullet that struck Steenkamp's skull broke into two fragments, one of which exited her head and struck the wall behind her. The first shot into the right hip broke Steenkamp's hip bone, Mangena said. Together: Reeva Steenkamp pictured with Pistorius. The prosecution allege he intentionally killed her after an argument . 'I'm of the opinion that after this wound was inflicted, my lady, she dropped immediately,' Mangena said, addressing the judge. Steenkamp slumped into a 'seated or semi-seated position' on top of the magazine rack in the cubicle, where she was hit another two times, he said. Pistorius fired from a distance of at least 60 centimeters (24 inches) and no further than 3 meters (9.8 feet) away, where there was a wall behind him, Mangena said. He described the impact of the hollow point bullets in Pistorius' gun, which were designed to cause maximum damage to an intended target. 'It hits the target, it opens up, it creates six talons, and these talons are sharp,' Mangena said. 'It cuts through the organs of a human being.' The defense said it would challenge Mangena's testimony regarding the sequence of the shots. Also Wednesday, the chief prosecutor said he planned to wrap up his case early next week after calling four or five more witnesses. Judge Thokozile Masipa granted Nel's request to adjourn the trial until Monday so that Nel has time to consult his last witnesses. No court session is scheduled on Friday, which is a national holiday in South Africa. 'We foresee that we'll call four or five more witnesses and that we'll be able to close our case early next week,' Nel said. Happy times: Oscar Pistorius relaxes at home in pictures taken by Sportsmail's Andy Hooper last year . His lawyer said that Pistorius has never returned to the house since he fatally shot Steenkamp in an upstairs bathroom in the pre-dawn hours of February 14 last year . In other testimony Wednesday, police Col. Ian van der Nest testified that many of the blood spots and stains found in various parts of Pistorius' house were due to arterial bleeding, consistent with the gunshot wounds on Steenkamp's head and arm. Some stains came from Steenkamp's blood-soaked hair as well as her short pants, which had been saturated with blood, he said. Another witness, Col. Mike Sales, investigated the web history on two iPad tablets found in Pistorius' home. He analyzed the activity on one of the devices hours before Steenkamp was killed, he said. Around 6.30 p.m. South African time on Feb. 13, according to records shown on TV monitors in court, a search was made on Google for a pornographic website. Then, straight after, a page was accessed that was described with the words 'Mobile Porn, Free Mobile Porn, iPhone Porn, Phone Porn, iPad Porn.' Other Internet searches referred to car websites and details on cars, including a Ford Ranger SUV, an Aston Martin and a British-made Morgan sports car. Col. Sales said the searches and website history on the second iPad showed similar records to the first.","Shot Steenkamp in bathroom of luxury home in Pretoria gated community .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron last night told other EU leaders he was ‘completely unapologetic’ about refusing to back Jean-Claude Juncker for Europe’s top job as it emerged there have been secret talks over the candidate’s drinking and smoking habits. European diplomats claimed Mr Juncker ‘chain-smoked’ his way through one meeting yesterday and was attempting to have a smoking ban in the European Parliament building in Brussels lifted before he has even been appointed. But now several EU leaders are understood to have discussed allegations that the former Luxembourg Prime Minister is a heavy drinker during talks on who should become president of the European Commission. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured with French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Menin Gate, will step up his opposition to the allocation of Brussels jobs . Ahead of the crunch vote, David Cameron was welcomed by European Council President Herman van Rompuy to a ceremony marking the centenary of the outbreak of World War I, in Ypres, Belgium . The row over appointing Jean-Claude Juncker to the European Commission Presidency threatens to overshadow events marking 100 years since the start of the Great War . ‘Alcohol consumption has been raised by a number of leaders since the [European] Parliament elections [in May],’ said one diplomat. The row over Europe’s leadership, expected to end in humiliation for Mr Cameron at a Brussels summit today, has plunged Britain’s relationship with the rest of the EU into deep crisis. Mr Cameron will today warn his EU counterparts that the appointment of Mr Juncker, whom he considers an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform, risks pushing the UK closer to the EU exit door. He also rejected last-ditch attempts by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to persuade him to cave in and not force the appointment of Mr Juncker to a vote, saying there would be ‘consequences’ if Britain is overruled. Yesterday he vowed to fight 'until the end' the appointment of a man seen by the UK as a roadblock to reform. Labour and the Lib Dems have publicly supported the Tories in insisting Mr Juncker is the wrong man for the job. Downing Street argues that the decision should have been taken between EU leaders, and not imposed by the EPP – the largest group in the European Parliament. Mr Cameron is expected to force an unprecedented vote on Mr Juncker’s appointment, leaving other leaders to have to justify their decision. The row threatens to overshadow a gathering of EU leaders at the highly symbolic venue of Ypres to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War. Downing Street argues Jean-Claude Juncker's appointment has been forced by parties in the European Parliament, and not mutual agreement between elected heads of government . David Cameron speaks with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt - with whom he famously posed for a 'selfie' with during Nelson Mandela's memorial service . Mr Cameron and Ms Thorning-Schmidt - who is the daughter-in-law of former Labour leader Lord Kinnock - appeared to be engaged in animated conversation . After paying respect to the memory of the dead with a minute's silence, Mr Cameron faces an awkward dinner with Mrs Merkel and other leaders with whom he has very publicly rowed. As the events got underway, Mr Cameron told reporters: ‘'I am completely unapologetic about standing up for an important principle in Europe, which is that the elected heads of government should make these choices,' he said. 'I am also unapologetic about the need for people to carry forward badly-needed reform in Europe and there will be a vote tomorrow and we'll see the outcome of that vote. ‘It's absolutely vital people know that with me you get what I said I'm going to do in Europe.' The bitter row has exposed the dire relations between London and many other European capitals, with the Tories coming closing to accusing other leaders of lying about their support for Mr Juncker. In an apparent swipe at some of his fellow leaders, who are reported to have voiced unease with Mr Juncker's candidacy in private talks, Mr Cameron said: 'It's very important in Europe, that you say what you say in private, and it's the same as what you say in public.' There is growing speculation that Mr Cameron will threaten defeat over the Commission presidency would make a British exit from the EU more likely in the referendum he is planning for 2017. Mr Cameron added: ‘My message to my fellow heads of government and heads of state is that this approach that they are contemplating taking is the wrong approach for Europe. 'They are about to take what I think is the wrong step. So I will make that argument, I will stick to my guns, I will stick to my principles, I will insist on that vote. We will have to wait and see what actually happens in that vote. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to play down the consequences of a failure to find consensus on the presidency. 'It would not be a drama if we voted with a qualified majority only,' she said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted it would 'not be a drama' if Mr Cameron forces the issue to a vote. They are pictured at the Menin Gate with French President Francois Hollande . Cameron, left, speaks with Hollande during the ceremony. But he faces an awkward dinner with other EU leaders over the issue . The European heads of states attend the ceremony marking the centenary of the outbreak of World War I . To mark the occasion, the European Union donated a symbolic bench with bronzed copper plates reading the word 'Peace' in the EU's 24 official languages . Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt (front) plants a porcelain flower at the 'Peace bench' ahead of David Cameron, Austria Federal Chancellor Werner Faymann, Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Sweden Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, and German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel . 'But . - and I have also stressed this again and again before - all . consultations are carried out within a European spirit and the concerns . of all member states taken seriously.' And . Sweden, which had initially expressed reservations about Mr Juncker's . candidacy, has now indicated that it will not block his nomination. Swedish finance minister Anders Borg told the BBC: 'I think it's quite clear that there is an overwhelming support for Jean-Claude Juncker as the head of the Commission. 'It's a key interest for Sweden, but also for Germany and the Netherlands and many other European countries to keep the UK in the European Union, so we could have seen strong arguments for listening to David Cameron when he raised this. German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives, at the Cloth Hall for the EU Summit meeting in Ypres . 'But now we are in a position where it is quite clear that there is overwhelming support, so we have to accept that.' Labour said Mr Cameron had mishandled the issue. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: . 'Sadly, the handling of these negotiations have turned a Europe divided over Jean-Claude Juncker into a Europe apparently united against David Cameron.' 'My personal judgment is he was too public, too personal in his attacks, too early, with the result that public criticism got confused with private influence,' said Mr Alexander. Business Secretary Vince Cable has also claimed Mr Cameron's robust opposition to Mr Juncker becoming president of the European Commission 'has not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe'. Meanwhile, The Prime Minister believes he can ‘dodge’ holding an in/out EU referendum in 2017, a senior Tory warned last night. Dominic Cummings, former aide to Education Secretary Michael Gove, said: ‘Cameron’s inner circle thinks he can still dodge the bullet of a referendum, though if he tries his party may send in a firing squad.’","Prime Minister remains defiant, insisting: 'I will stick to my guns'

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Thousands of British expats are suspected of committing benefit fraud abroad in the past year, costing Britain more than £80m - with Spain, Pakistan and Turkey the top destinations. An astonishing new league table reveals 7,296 British nationals were accused of fiddling their benefits in the past year in 157 countries and regions worldwide. The most common cases involved bogus . claims for pension credit, which was around £52million, housing benefit . - £19million - and income support, which was more than £10million. Scroll down for video . Britons living abroad cheated the taxpayer out of more than £80m last year in false benefit claims. Karen Trant, 51, from Dartmouth, Devon, . pictured, illegally claimed £134,000 over 13 . years while living in Goa, India . Top destinations for fraud abroad were Spain, Pakistan and Turkey where more than 1,500 cases were reported in 2013-14. The figures from the Department of Work and Pensions show 628 cases of benefit fraud reported in Pakistan, 298 in Turkey, 282 in India and 246 in the USA. But the list of suspected fraudsters included such far-flung destinations as Madagascar, which had two cases, Oman, Jamaica, Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean and even the Vatican – where one person who was claiming a disability benefit was found on an Italian walking holiday. Most popular on the list was Spain, home to around a million Britons, where 769 cases were investigated over the past year, including a couple who illegally received £140,000. William Bunce, 54, and Berwyn Jones, 50, of Pontypool in Wales who lived in the UK, said they didn’t have partners and were unfit for work. They spent the money living a life of luxury in Spain. Earlier this year they were both sentenced to pay back the full amount and sentenced to four months in prison at Newport Crown Court. More than 769 cases of expat benefit fraudsters were investigated in Spain in 2013, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Pictured: Marbella, Spain, which is popular with British expats . Another high-claimer was Karen Trant, who claimed to be crippled by a fear of open spaces which left her housebound. But she was snared by investigators are they found photographs of her enjoying beach holidays in Goa. 1) Spain - 769 . 2) Pakistan - 628 . 3) Turkey - 298 . 4) India - 282 . 5) USA - 246 . 6) France - 213 . 7) Bangladesh - 180 . 8) Thailand - 172 . 9) Australia - 130 . 10) Cyprus - 126 . The 51-year-old, who claimed £134,000 of taxpayers’ money over 13 years, bought a holiday home in the sunny Indian resort, and spent thousands of pounds on cosmetic surgery. She was pictured sunning herself on an empty beach and riding a horse, having invested in a tummy tuck, liposuction and work on her ‘bingo wings’. Miss Trant, from Dartmouth in Devon, was jailed last month for 27 months at Plymouth Crown Court after admitting unlawfully obtaining benefits. The most common reasons were people failing to inform the Department of Work and Pensions they were living abroad, or not reporting the death of someone entitled to receive benefits. On top of any fine or prison sentence handed out by the courts, the government is able to withhold up to 40pc of the person’s benefits in order to get the fraudulently claimed money back. Welfare minister Mark Harper said: ‘We’re clamping down on fraud – both at home and abroad – so money goes to those who need it most, rather than lining the pockets of criminals sunning themselves overseas. ‘We’re toughening up the system and working more closely with foreign authorities so we can bring benefit cheats to court and make sure they’re appropriately punished. More fraudsters are realising there are no hiding places when you break the law.’ Richard West, head of the DWP’s counter-fraud teams, said: ‘Cases range from people hiding foreign assets and homes to those moving abroad, either temporarily or permanently, at the taxpayers’ expense. ‘Benefit cheats need to know that even if they are out of the country, our teams will still investigate and, where necessary, bring them back to the UK to face justice.'","Figures show 7,296 British expats were accused of fiddling expenses in 2013 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . George Osborne's cat Freya has been run over outside the gates of Downing Street. The Chancellor's pet was 'clipped' by a vehicle on Whitehall last night and has been rushed to a vets for treatment, MailOnline understands. The concerned Osborne family are waiting for news about the tabby, who has been left battered and bruised by the incident. George Osborne's pet cat Freya is being treated by vets after being struck by a vehicle outside Downing Street . News of the accident emerged on World Cat Day. Freya has gained a reputation for wandering far and wide from the family home in Downing Street. Mr Osborne bought the tabby for his children in 2009 when the family were living in Notting Hill, West London. But a few months later, she vanished. It was not until two years ago, having moved into Downing Street, that Mr Osborne’s wife Frances got a call telling her Freya had been found, apparently living as a stray. Last year it emerged her tendency to prowl the corridors of power had sparked suggestions she should be being used by foreign spies. It is thought she was trying to cross Whitehall last night when she was hit by a vehicle. The road stretches from Trafalgar Square, past Downing Street and down to Parliament Square and the Houses of Parliament. Last year Mr Osborne tweeted a picture of Freya ahead of his Budget, joking there were 'no rabbits in the red box this week - but there was a cat' Mr Osborne is said to be grateful for the help passers-by gave to Freya, and is hoping she will be allowed home soon . It is not thought her injuries are life-threatening, and family friends say they hope she will be allowed home this weekend. Mr Osborne has made clear he will be picking up all of the vet bills. Freya's tenure in Downing Street has been eventful. In 2012 she was pictured fighting with Larry, the cat belonging to David Cameron brought in to catch mice in Number 10. In May, the cat was chauffeur-driven back home after turning up frightened and lost in Vauxhall where she was found by homelessness outreach worker Kate Jones who identified her from the tag on her collar. Ms Jones, who works with Thames Reach's London Street Rescue, said she had lots of experience helping the homeless in London - but that it was the first time she had helped a cat find shelter. Freya spent the night on Ms Jones's pillow before being collected by Downing Street officials. She had somehow travelled south of the river and at least 1.5 miles before being found. Ms Jones later posted a picture of the cat with a note to remind Mr Osborne that while she had been given shelter for the night in this instance, most homeless people are not so fortunate. The Chancellor has built a reputation for being a keen animal lover. In addition to Freya, the Osborne's also have a dog, a young bichon frise named Lola. Shortly after bowing to demands from their children Luke and Liberty, Mr Osborne said there were 'some early issues with toilet training ... but we don't care. We love her'.","The Chancellor's pet was injured in an accident on Whitehall last night .

"By . Jaya Narain . Max Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years in May after a jury found him guilty of indecent assaults . Disgraced publicist Max Clifford faces financial ruin after his sex abuse victims yesterday launched a legal bid to seize a large slice of his fortune. He was jailed for eight years in May after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1966 and 1984. The former public relations guru is now facing a lawsuit for £1.5million in compensation from one victim, with more expected to follow. The action could see him being forced to sell off his portfolio of luxury homes. Clifford was named in legal papers lodged at the High Court on Thursday by the first of six victims set to take legal action against him. A writ has also been served on him. He has two large homes in Hersham, Surrey – one he valued at £3.5million in 2008 and another, in which his daughter Louise lives, valued at £2.5million. But the rise in property prices means they could be worth a total of £8.5million. The PR expert also has a house in southern Spain, which he valued at £1.5million in 2008. He made £2.5million a year from his PR work and the latest accounts for his company, Max Clifford Associates, in 2012 showed a turnover of £3.5million. In total Clifford, who has appealed against the sentence imposed at Southwark Crown Court, is estimated to be worth around £10million though this will have been depleted by the legal cost of his defence. He will also have lost a chunk of his fortune to his ex-wife Jo who was granted a ‘quickie’ divorce just weeks after he was jailed. Last month he took steps to wind up Max Clifford Associates after a meeting of creditors. But it is believed he may have other money stashed away in foreign bank accounts and investments. Lawyers may ask any court which backs a civil action to freeze his assets and bring insolvency proceedings. Last night the anonymous victim who launched the action said: ‘What he did to me and others was unforgivable. He used his position and status to abuse us. We are now picking up the pieces of our broken lives. Max Clifford pictured leaving his home in Weybridge, Surrey - one of the houses he may be forced to sell . ‘I will use any compensation I receive to pay for further psychological therapy which I feel will help me regain some measure of normal existence.’ She is represented by solicitor Richard Scorer, of Slater & Gordon, who said: ‘If Max Clifford is seeking a reduction in his sentence, he now has an opportunity to show that he is truly remorseful. He should admit his offences and compensate the victims he so shamelessly abused.’ Mr Scorer also confirmed that Slater & Gordon will be bringing up to six further civil actions against Clifford in the forthcoming weeks.","Max Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years in May for eight indecent assaults .

"By . Associated Press . A provincial music teacher in Argentina emerged in public for the first time since being abruptly thrust into the limelight as a symbol of his country's reckoning with the brutal dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. Ignacio Hurban introduced himself to the public as the long-sought grandson of Estela de Carlotto, a human rights activist who has spent the past 36 years searching for him and other children taken from their parents during the country's 'dirty war.' Hurban said he began to doubt his origins about two months ago. He decided to have his DNA tested and compared to samples in a database of families looking for the children of leftists and suspected government opponents who were killed during the 1976-83 dictatorship. Ignacio Hurban, a provincial music teacher in Argentina, talks to reporters after reuniting with his grandmother, Estela de Carlotto, who has dedicated the past 36 years to finding children who were abducted during Argentina's 'dirty war' Hurban, 36, urged others who may wonder about their heritage to come forward and help the organization founded by de Carlotto, Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, to resolve the fate of about 400 more children whose whereabouts remain unknown . The results linked him to de Carlotto, whose daughter, Laura, a university activist, was executed in a clandestine military jail in August 1978, two months after she had given birth. The music teacher and composer from the small city of Olavarria urged others who may wonder about their heritage to come forward and help the organization founded by de Carlotto, Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, to resolve the fate of about 400 more children whose whereabouts remain unknown. 'Whoever has doubts needs to come to take the test,' he told a packed news conference in Buenos Aires. REL . The 36-year-old Hurban calmly fielded questions as he sat beside his newly found grandmother, but he brushed aside attempts to find out about his apparently illegal adoption and he praised the couple who raised him in the Argentine countryside. He was brought up 'by an extraordinary couple with the greatest of love,' Hurban told reporters. His sudden transformation into a national figure began Tuesday when de Carlotto announced that a DNA test had confirmed the identity of her daughter's son. De Carlotto's search made her a symbol of the campaign for justice for victims of the ""dirty war,"" a period when security forces tortured and killed thousands of people in a campaign against guerrillas and opponents. With Hurban, they have located 114 of those children. Hurban is making his first public appearance since he was identified as the long-sought grandson of Carlotto, the country's leading human rights activist . During the dictatorship, children of the government's opponents were taken away and given to families supportive of the regime. A judge has said she would call Hurban to testify next week about what he knows of his origins for a possible criminal case, but on Friday she decided to postpone the questioning until later. Many in Argentina knew the long-lost grandson as ""Guido,"" the name Laura had intended to give the boy. Asked how he would like to be addressed, Hurban said he would stick with ""Ignacio,"" the name he has used all his life and will continue to use in his career as a musician and teacher. ""I'm used to my name, Ignacio, and I will keep using it but I understand there is a family that for a long time has called me 'Guido,' and for them I am 'Guido,'"" he said. ""I am comfortable with the truth that has come to me and I am happy."" Hurban is reconnecting with his biological family after nearly 40 years.

"By . Tamara Cohen . Fixed Odds Betting Terminals  allow users to spend up to £100 a go and are blamed for a  rise in gambling . Betting machines dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’ could spread to arcades and service stations as part of proposals from the amusement industry. Ministers are under pressure to allow the machines – which are currently only allowed in betting shops – to be more widespread. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) are casino-style games which allow users to spend up to £100 a spin and are blamed for a worrying rise in problem gambling. They generate more than half of bookmakers’ profits. However they have been subject to greater restrictions since April, when new rules meant anyone wanting to spend over £50 must inform staff. Now BACTA, which represents the British amusement industry, is lobbying to be allowed to host the machines. In a letter to MPs and peers, the trade body says if the Government has not cracked down on the terminals, then they should be allowed in ‘any regulated adult-only gambling establishment’. It adds that it is ‘unfair’ to let betting shops reap all the benefits from the profitable machines. ‘The current situation... makes no sense and gives the bookmakers an unfair advantage,’ BACTA says. ‘If the Government deems [£50] a safe limit for bookmakers there is no reason that it is not safe for everybody.’ Campaigners say the amusement industry would have a strong case on competition grounds. There are around 33,000 FOBTs in the UK, but Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said this move could add another 8,000. Ministers are under pressure to allow the machines – which are currently only allowed in betting shops – to be more widespread across the UK after BACTA started lobbying for them to feature in the amusement industry . ‘How can the Government say, ‘No’ when they are saying to bookies that it is OK to have them?’ he said. BACTA confirmed its position but did not wish to comment further. A spokesman from the Department for Culture Media and Sport said: ‘The rules around where FOBTs can be based are very clear and they will not be moving into other areas.’","Fixed Odds Betting Terminals allow users to spend up to £100 on each spin .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said he learnt about economics at a young age, watching his family struggle to balance the books . Tory Cabinet minister Sajid Javid today revealed how his immigrant bus driving father taught him the value of money, as he launched an attack on Labour's tax and spending plans. The Culture Secretary said he learnt about economics at a young age, watching his family struggle to balance the books and realising 'you can't spend money you don't have'. He invoked Margaret Thatcher as he spoke of a 'greater moral purpose in politics' to leave the next generation better off. The Conservative have stepped up their attack on Labour's economic record, warning Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have not learnt the lesson of the spiralling deficit they left in 2010. But in a speech in London today, Mr Javid struck a personal note with his recollections of how money was tight growing up. He was born in Rochdale, the middle child of five sons. His father Abdul, who came to Britain from Pakistan, worked around the clock as a bus driver, earning him the nickname 'Mr Night And Day'. When Mr Javid was four, his father took over a ladieswear shop in inner-city Bristol, and the family moved into a two-bedroom flat above it. Three brothers shared on room while Mr Javid and another younger brother were in a room with their parents. 'I learnt about economics at a young age,' he said in today's speech at the Centre for Policy Studies in Westminste,. 'My father came to this country with virtually nothing. 'But he worked hard on the buses to save enough money to start his own business. He began with a market stall and then he eventually opened a shop.' He recalled how living above the shop he would 'help out whenever I could'. 'That background taught me some valuable lessons. It taught me that you need to plan ahead. 'It taught me that you've got to live within your means. It taught me you can't spend money you don't have. 'These are lessons this Government understands. Steadily, step by step, we are getting our country's economy back on track and we are getting the deficit down. We have a plan and it is working.' He insisted the task to cut the deficit had to continue, to ensure the debts were not left for future generations.' A former banker, Mr Javid was elected as an MP in 2010, and became Treasury minister two years later. In April this year he joined the Cabinet as Culture Secretary, after Maria Miller was forced to resign over her expenses. He said: 'It was Margaret Thatcher who said 'we in politics are in the business of planting trees for our children and grandchildren or we have no business being in politics at all'. 'I agree there is no greater moral purpose in politics than that – to leave our children something better than we ourselves have known. That is why we have to get the deficit down.' Mr Javid accused Labour of planning to spend and borrow more if elected in 2015. The country, he said, faced a 'serious decision' at next year's general election about whether to continue with the current Government's 'long-term economic plan' it was putting into action or to 'hand Ed Miliband the keys to Downing Street and to go back to Labour's approach of higher taxes and more spending'. A former banker, Mr Javid was elected as an MP in 2010, and became Treasury minister two years later. In April this year he joined the Cabinet as Culture Secretary, after Maria Miller was forced to resign over her expenses . He added: 'Do we continue to do the right thing, getting the economy back on track and getting the deficit down? Or do we return to spending more than we can afford and allow the deficit to continue for decades to come?' The deficit he said was already down by more than a third, was predicted to fall to half by the time of the election in 2015 and then be eliminated before the end of the next parliament. He said: 'When it comes to the deficit, Labour haven't learnt their lesson. No matter what they say in public, Labour are still planning to spend more and borrow more if they are elected. 'Spending and borrowing run through Labour like the words in a stick of rock.' He claimed that Labour's future plans would mean in 21 years time the government would still be running a deficit of £24 billion in today's money. 'For every child in Britain today this is equivalent to an extra £35,000 of debt on each of their heads. More debt than they could ever hope to repay. 'Our plan to run absolute surpluses is the only reliable way to get the size of Britain's debt down to safe levels over a sensible time scale.' But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Chris Leslie, said: 'These numbers have been totally made up. Labour has not set out any plans for extra capital spending after the election, so this is just another example of the Tory lie machine in action. 'Sajid Javid should look at what is happening under his Government. Not only has David Cameron failed to deliver rising living standards he is also set to break his promise to balance the books by next year. In fact, this Government is set to borrow £190 billion more than planned in 2010 and borrowing is going up not down so far this year.' He added: 'Labour has set out a tough fiscal commitment to balance the books - on the same measure used by George Osborne in this parliament - and get the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next parliament. 'We will get the deficit down where this Government has failed, but we will do so in a fairer way - including by reversing David Cameron's tax cut for millionaires.'","Culture Secretary says his family's struggle taught him about economics .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Cheated justice: John William Good has been jailed for 12 years . A rapist who cheated justice for nearly 25 years has been jailed because of advances in DNA profiling. John William Good, 54, attacked a nurse in the early hours of July 5 1987, forcing her into a car at knifepoint as she walked along Hillingdon Road in Uxbridge, west London. She was driven to a nearby multi-storey car park where Good raped her. He then drove her to a closed garage forecourt and raped her a second time. The woman reported the incident to police and an investigation was launched but no suspect was identified at that time. A Metropolitan Police cold case review in 2011 established the availability of samples which could be tested further after advances in forensics. A DNA sample was identified and highlighted a potential match to Good. He was arrested in July last year then charged with kidnap and two counts of rape. Yesterday he was jailed for 12 years at the Old Bailey. Detective Sergeant Andy Beete said: 'The Met's Sapphire cold case team is committed to pursuing rapists and sexual offenders, regardless of the time which has passed since the offences were committed.' He encouraged any victims of rape or serious sexual assault to speak to the authorities.

"By . Martha De Lacey . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A woman who ran away with her seven-year-old son to stop him having cancer treatment said she had 'no choice' because she felt she was on a 'conveyor belt'. Sally Roberts, 37, who is from New Zealand but lives in Devon, disappeared with Neon after a dispute with her estranged husband Ben over the boy's condition and treatment, despite doctors saying their son could die within months without radiotherapy. Today Ms Roberts told ITV's Daybreak that she does not necessarily want him treated in an 'alternative way' but wanted options other than radiotherapy explored amid her fears of its potentially damaging affect on Neon. Sally Roberts, left, appeared on Daybreak to explain why she disappeared with Neon, right . She agreed that going on the run with her son was an 'act of desperation'. She said: 'I was on a conveyor belt and I had no choice. They said treatment must start. 'I thought if I was going to take him to the hospital they would never let us go home.' New Zealander Ms Roberts, who was living in Tiverton, Devon, hit the headlines last week when she disappeared with Neon. Both she and her son were found safe after a judge ordered a search. Ms Roberts, who now lives in Brighton, East Sussex, later apologised for vanishing and said that she had panicked. She told Daybreak that she was not adamantly opposed to giving her son radiotherapy treatment. She said: 'I have been asking the whole time, ‘Please show me evidence that he does need this treatment'. Sally Roberts appeared on Daybreak, left, to explain why she doesn't want seven-year-old Neon, right, to have radiotherapy treatment for cancer . 'The only thing they can come up with is a study from the 1940s. It's just radiotherapy, this is how we do it, chemotherapy - they haven't been exploring other options.' Ms Roberts said she had been contacted by medical professionals supporting her belief that there are other options to treat her son. Speaking about why she was so against her son receiving radiotherapy, she said: 'Because it damages your DNA. 'I feel we can still save his life. I'm incredibly confident.

Asked how she would feel if by denying him treatment, Neon died, Ms Roberts said: 'How do I live with myself if I allow him to have radiotherapy and I have to then watch him suffer the consequences of that treatment?'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Drug addicts caught with Class A substances like heroin and cocaine should not be 'chucked' in jail, Nick Clegg has claimed. The Deputy Prime Minister said it was 'utterly senseless' that people who needed treatment were instead thrown behind bars when found with small amounts of drugs for personal use. But the Home Office insisted the courts need to have the power to imprison serious offenders who cause 'the most harm in our communities'. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg said it was 'utterly senseless' that people who needed treatment were instead thrown behind bars when found with small amounts of drugs for personal use . Mr Clegg has repeatedly put himself at odds with the official government position on drugs. He has called for a Royal Commission to examine all drug laws, something David Cameron rejects. Now Mr Clegg has vowed that at the next election the Lib Dems will promise to abolish prison sentences for drug possession. Mr Clegg said: 'Drugs do untold harm to individuals and to communities. We need a radically smarter approach if we are serious about tackling this problem. 'Liberal Democrats believe the first step is to recognise that drug use is primarily a health problem. Addicts need treatment, not locking up. It is a nonsense to waste scarce resources on prison cells for cannabis users. 'Simply chucking people into prison and turning a blind eye is the lazy option because all it ends up doing is making the problem worse. Heroin addicts are to be given foil for free in a bid to encourage them to inhale the drug . Drugs paraphernalia will be given to heroin addicts for free by the government in a bid to deter them from injecting the substance. Users will be given free foil to help them heat up the class-A drug in an attempt to encourage them to inhale it and thereby avoid the risks of contracting diseases such as HIV. Aluminium foil is used to warm heroin and breathe in its fumes to get high. Under current laws health professionals are banned from giving out foil to addicts, but the new rules, thought up by the Home Office, would end this practice. The scheme is likely to draw criticism from anti-drugs campaigners for fear it could encourage people to take drugs.' 'I've always believed that if you're anti-drugs you should be pro-reform. That's why we will ensure nobody will go to prison where their only offence is possession of drugs for their own personal use. 'Instead these people should receive non-custodial sentences and addicts should get the treatment they need to stop using drugs. 'These reforms will ensure that drug users get the help they need and that taxpayers don't foot the bill for a system that doesn't work.' More than 1,000 people a year in England and Wales are jailed for possession of drugs for their own personal use. Mr Clegg says half are for possession of cannabis, but says millions of people know 'intuitively that it does not make sense chucking a 22-year-old into prison for the possession of cannabis. The people who should be behind bars are the criminal gangs, the Mr Bigs'. He argues that the UK should approach the drug problem as a health rather than a law and order issue. In a swipe at Mr Cameron's party, he said the Tories were slow to realise that it was time to rethink drugs laws. Mr Clegg added: 'The Conservatives are what it says on the tin — they are conservatives. They take a long time sometimes to move with the times. 'If there was evidence that banging them up works then all their misplaced tough talk would be justified. But it does not work.' The Lib Dem manifesto will include a commitment to end the use of imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use and move the drugs and alcohol policy lead from the Home Office to the Department of Health. In addition, the party will promise to establish a commission to assess the effectiveness of current drugs laws and alternative approaches, including further work on diverting users into treatment or into civil penalties that do not attract a criminal record, which can seriously affect their chances of employment. However, the Home Office defended the current law. A spokesman said: 'Drugs destroy lives and cause misery to families and communities and this Government has no intention of decriminalising them. 'The vast majority of people caught in possession of an illegal drug are not imprisoned, with only 3 per cent of offenders found guilty of a drug possession offence last year being sentenced to immediate custody. 'It is vital that the police and criminal justice system have a range of measures available to them, including community-based interventions. 'But law enforcement and the criminal justice system must also have the tools to deal robustly with serious and repeat offenders who cause the most harm in our communities.'","Lib Dem leader says it is 'utterly senseless' to impose custodial sentences .

"By . Tom Latchem . Verity makes her departure from Emmerdale in this week's explosive episodes . Verity Rushworth's honeymoon seems like it might be permanently on hold.  She and her husband Dominic were due to fly to the Maldives earlier this year, when she was asked to return to Emmerdale. Now, having worked for five months on the soap's major summer storyline leading up to her dramatic departure this week, Verity says the couple only have one thing on their minds - and it's not lying on a beach. 'We're both exhausted and really need this honeymoon,' says Verity, who married theatre director Dominic Shaw in March. 'Most people would just book it. But we're thinking, ""What if a job comes in?"" You could say we're workaholics! Dominic is working at the Edinburgh Festival and I'm already auditioning for other roles, so I might be tied up in another drama by the end of the year.' Yorkshire-born Verity's been in the thick of the action since joining Emmerdale as troublesome Donna Windsor in 1998, aged just 13. Her storylines included killing her headmistress in a hit-and-run accident, attempting suicide with an overdose and catching a sexually transmitted disease. Later, Donna joined the police. In 2008, however, Verity thought she risked being typecast and decided to spread her wings. She won roles as Penny in West End musical Hairspray, and as Maria in the UK tour of The Sound Of Music. But Verity, now 28, was lured back by the promise she'd be at the heart of a blockbuster plot. 'I jumped at the chance,' she says. The plot involved Donna, who's dying of asbestos-related lung cancer mesothelioma, bringing her five-year-old daughter April back to the village so the youngster's father Marlon Dingle can care for her. Desperate for money for April's future, corrupt copper Donna teams up with crook Ross Barton for a series of robberies, including one this week. 'There's a hostage situation, where Donna has to make a split-second decision that will have tragic consequences,' Verity reveals. 'It will really shock viewers.' 'I'm very proud of Donna's final scenes, which include  a dramatic robbery and a hostage situation . She also makes a touching video message for her daughter April to see when she grows up. I was very nervous about the scene but it went so well the whole crew applauded.' Donna manages to record a video of herself for her daughter to watch when she's gone - and Verity says filming the emotional scenes left her worn out. 'I've cried so much I feel I've been through therapy,' she says. Verity believes the storyline is a fitting finale to her Emmerdale career. 'Hopefully this will show casting directors I mean business. But even if nothing happens after this I'd feel very happy and proud I got to play this great storyline.' That doesn't mean she isn't sad to go. 'There were tears on my last day,' she admits. 'But it's definitely the right decision.' Verity turns 29 on Friday and has very clear goals. 'By this time next year I'd love to have appeared in a period drama or performed at the National Theatre,' she says. 'At 30, I'll start thinking about having a family. Oh yes, and of course I'd like to visit the Maldives!' Holidays – beach or city? I like  New York, where there are shops, shows and cocktails!Meat or fish? Fillet steak every time – I'm a real carnivore.Dogs or cats? I'd like a furry dog like a Bichon Frise. I've got my fingers crossed for my birthday this week!Wine or spirits? Vodka – with lime and lemonade. But my hangovers are getting worse as I get older!Curb Your Enthusiasm or Modern Family? Modern Family – it's the perfect blend of comedy and drama.Dame Judi Dench or Imelda Staunton? Imelda – she's versatile, down-to-earth and a great role model.Tennis or football?

Lucas Jutkiewicz, from Middlesbrough, £1.5million . PLAYERS OUT: . Junior Stanislas, to Bournemouth, free . Chris Baird, to West Brom, free . NET SPEND: £3m . New boys: Matt Taylor (left) and Steven Reid (right) are two of six summer signings at Burnley . ONE PLAYER THEY NEED: They desperately require a centre-back. Their pairing of Jason Shackell and Michael Duff were solid last year but noway near Premier League quality. Anyone with some top flight experience will help their cause. KEY MAN: Danny Ings – The hit-man netted 26 times in 45 games last season and remains with Burnley despite interest from other top-flight clubs. FINISHING POSITION: 20 . WORD ON THE TERRACES: Sean Dyche worked miracles to get them promoted, spending money on just one player from when he joined the club in 2012 to helping them finish second. It is going to take something even more special to keep them up on a comparatively minuscule budget again. ONE REASON TO BE CHEERFUL: The squad – with only 22 first-team players last season – has been bulked up with six new signings. Making Kightly’s move permanent is a great piece of business and he could be a real attacking outlet for them this season. ONE REASON TO BE FEARFUL: Do the rest of the signings have the quality to keep them up? Marvin Sordell has failed to make an impact in the top flight in the past and the the likes of Matthew Taylor and Steven Reid are merely unwanted by other clubs. Big ask: Sean Dyche will do well to keep Burnley in the Premier League after guiding them to promotion . LEICESTER CITY . Ended their 10-year absence from the top flight by running away with the Championship title. They were promoted by the beginning of April with a club record 102 points and 31 victories, nine points clear of second-place Burnley. Easy. PLAYERS IN: . Jack Barmby, from Manchester United, free . Matthew Upson, from Brighton, free . Louis Rowley, from Manchester United, free . Leonardo Ulloa, from Brighton, £8million . PLAYERS OUT: . Zak Whitbread, to Derby, free . Neil Danns, to Bolton, free . Benedict Frempah, to Ross County, free . NET SPEND: £8million . Pressure: Leonardo Ulloa (centre) will be expected to score goals after arriving from Brighton for £8million . ONE PLAYER THEY NEED: Another quality striker is essential. The club are interested in Troy Deeney, but Watford are holding out for a sum similar to the one paid for Ulloa. KEY MAN: Kasper Schmeichel – Has the potential to be one of the best goalkeepers in the league next season and could be crucial to keeping out the opposition while sustaining heavy pressure. PREDICTED FINISHING POSITION: 17 . WORD ON THE TERRACES: After securing the services manager Nigel Pearson and sensational stopper Schmeichel on new deals, fans are optimistic about survival. However, significant transfer funds have been splashed out on a striker with no Premier League experience and they will be relying on him to start firing quickly. ONE REASON TO BE CHEERFUL: The way they stormed to the Championship title should give the players huge confidence going into the Premier League campaign. They must maintain that momentum if they want any chance of staying in the league. ONE REASON TO BE FEARFUL: If they fail to stay up, top-flight clubs will be all over their best players and the likes of Schmeichel and Andy King could move elsewhere, making it even harder to get back up again. Safe hands: Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel has the ability to play a crucial role in Leicester's survival bid . QPR . They did it the hard way. Harry Redknapp’s side, full of players with Premier League experience, were expected to run away with the league, but they finished fourth and eventually won promotion via the play-offs. PLAYERS IN: . Rio Ferdinand, from Manchester United, free . Steven Caulker, from Cardiff, £8million . Jordon Mutch, from Cardiff, £6million . PLAYERS OUT: . Tom Hitchcock, to MK Dons, free . Aaron Hughes, to Brighton, free . Esteban Granero, to Real Sociedad, £2.1million . NET SPEND: £11.9million . Defensive duo:  Rio Ferdinand (left) and Steven Caulker (right) have both been brought to Loftus Road . ONE PLAYER THEY NEED: A striker to partner the prolific Charlie Austin who can score goals in the top flight but is not prone to injury. If Redknapp can convince Loic Remy to stay and integrate him back into the side, he could well be the answer to their problems. KEY MAN: Charlie Austin – Scored 20 goals in 37 appearances last year despite struggling midway through the season with injury. His raw instinct as a striker means he has been crying out for a chance in the Premier League and could well surprise many teams. FINISHING POSITION: 14 . WORD ON THE TERRACES: Ferdinand and Caulker are superb acquisitions to create a formidable partnership at the centre of their defence. Fans are wary of their relegation in 2012, when they were not expected to go down but crashed out of the league, but more quality recruitments will settle their nerves. ONE REASON TO BE CHEERFUL: They have a manager with huge top-flight experience and the foundations of a Premier League team are already in place. Provided Redknapp can get the balance right, and bring in a few more faces, they should comfortably stay in the league. ONE REASON TO BE FEARFUL: They were never supposed to get relegated in the first place. Although Redknapp was not in charge for the whole season he still didn’t manage to keep them up and they were one of the surprise departures the season before last.

"By . Ruth Styles . With a Caribbean cruise with friends booked for November and a job she loves, Ashley Kurpiel, 31, considers herself lucky. But the Essex-born naturalised American has struggled all her life with a condition that is slowly turning her muscles into solid bone - and has already cost her her right arm. Now, the 31-year-old is hoping to experience as much of life as she can before her muscles seize up for good. Brave: Ashley (right) is slowly losing her ability to move thanks to a disease turning her muscles into bone . Lucky: Ashley, who has already lost an arm to the condition, says she is happy her jaw hasn't locked . Ashley is one of an estimated 700 people worldwide with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), an incurable disease sometimes known as 'stone man syndrome' because its devastating effects can leave sufferers completely immobilised, like living statues. 'My condition has made me who I am - an optimistic person with an inner strength and determination to succeed,' said Ashley. 'If I want to do something, then I normally find a way to do it. I don't know how much longer I will have movement in my body, so I want to experience as much as I can now. 'In other cases of FOP people have frozen solid, their jaws locking shut. They can't move and have to talk through their teeth long before they get to my age. So I actually feel extremely lucky.' The condition arises from a mutation of the body's repair mechanism which causes muscles, tendons and ligaments to convert to bone material when damaged. Ashley, whose mother Carol emigrated to Georgia from Hornchurch in Essex before she was born, was diagnosed with the condition when she was three years old - six months after her right arm was amputated by surgeons who wrongly suspected she had cancer. Childhood: Ashley, pictured with her mother Carol, was initially diagnosed with cancer at the age of three . Ambassador: Ashley now hopes to raise awareness of her condition and met the Dalai Lama in 2007 . 'During my childhood my mobility was fine, because I was still young,' she added. 'But I was quite unhappy. I felt very different from the other children at school, and I didn't have many friends. I was quite shy and kept myself to myself. It wasn't much of a life.' Her symptoms first began to show when she was a teenager, with gradual muscle stiffening accelerating as she grew older. 'I began to feel my body stiffen gradually. I knew I was finally facing the onset of the condition,' she remembers. 'I'd been told what was going to happen, and feeling the first symptoms made me want to experience everything life had to offer - before it was too late.' She married Shawn Keeney, 31, a man she met online, but the pair divorced in 2005 after three years of marriage. 'I'm still on good terms with Shawn and I look back on our time together with nothing but fondness,' says Ashley. Video source YouTube HitTheResetButton . Achievement: Ashley was able to complete a five kilometre surfing course using a specially adapted board . Proud: Ashley wants to do as much as she possibly can before her ability to move is completely lost . 'Walking down the aisle, with full use of my limbs, was one of the happiest days of my life, and no one can take that memory away from me.' Despite her happy memories, in May 2006, Ashley's life took a turn for the worse after she was involved in a serious car crash. She escaped without any broken bones but her right leg took a heavy impact. 'My doctor warned me that just the slightest bump could trigger the FOP to take hold. After the smash I fully expected my leg to freeze up permanently,' said Ashley. 'One of my worst fears was that my body would fuse upright, meaning I'd never be able to sit again. 'When my leg locked in a standing position I was sure I was facing a worst-case scenario. Luckily when the swelling went down I was able to bend the leg slightly. 'I spent a lot of time sitting in the hope it would fuse in that position. At least then I could sit in a wheelchair and be wheeled around.' Her leg locked into a bent position permanently in May 2007, and Ashley was fitted with a special platform shoe to help her maintain as much mobility as possible. Since the setback, Ashley has been determined to do more with her life and so far, has learned to surf and completed a five kilometre course in a specially-adapted wheelchair in August last year. She has also become a full-time ambassador for amputees and families affected by the FOP and in December she is going on a Caribbean cruise with 100 friends who are amputees. 'I've been blessed to meet so many truly amazing people, especially the Dalai Lama - that was a real honour,' said Ashley of the religious leader, whom she met in 2007. 'I feel so humbled that so many people have taken an interest, and hopefully found some inspiration, in my life.'","Ashley Kurpiel, 31, suffers from Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva .
Just 700 people worldwide have the illness which turns muscle to bone .
She has already lost an arm and the movement in one leg to the condition .

"By . Kristie Lau . Rising star: Blogger Bryan Grey Yambao, a.k.a. Bryanboy, pictured, has confirmed he will join the cast of America's Next Top Model . Bryan Grey Yambao, more commonly known as Bryanboy, will join the cast of America's Next Top Model. The 31-year-old fashion blogger, who launched his site in 2004, wrote on his Facebook this morning: 'Excited with my new role on cycle 19 of America's Next Top Model'. Although the CW network is yet to confirm how the blogger, who had lived in the Philippines, will be involved, he has already relocated to Los Angeles in order to film the reality series created by model Tyra Banks. He posted a photograph of his new Los Angeles apartment on Twitter yesterday. The new signing follows news that Ms Banks, 38, dumped the show's previous judges, fashion photographer Nigel Barker, runway coach J. Alexander and make-up artist Jay Manuel, last month. She told Access Hollywood: 'We reached a point, where we feel the show needs a new boost.' While many TV stars, such as Brooke Bourke and Katherine Heigl, have turned to blogging after building successful careers, it is the first time a blogger will become a TV star. His appointment had been hinted at for months. Mr Grey Yambao, who was raised in Manila, declined an interview with The Observer in February because he was not able to participate in any 'profiles pending a project with another media outlet' that 'would be developed/released by this summer'. The new season of America's Next Top Model is about to commence filming in Los Angeles shortly. Sources close to the blogger had told WWD yesterday that the blogger had signed a contract with the show and was 'en route to Los Angeles with a one-way air ticket'. He will join new cast members Rob Evans, a U.S. model and Johnny Wujek, a stylist for Katy Perry. Fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone will also return as a judge for a second season. Mr Grey Yambao wrote on Twitter on May 22: 'A new chapter is about to begin soon.' Old judges: The blogger's involvement comes after the show's creator Tyra Banks, left, dumped Nigel Barker, middle, and Jay Manuel, right. It is unclear what role the new recruit will play in the reality series . New judges: Model Rob Evans, left, will also join the series as will Johnny Wujek, right, Katy Perry's stylist . He also tweeted yesterday: 'Let the public voting commence – California State ID or New York State ID?' Although Bryanboy was never directly tied to it, the blogger is believed to have been behind the controversial gossip blog titled Chikatime. According to The Observer, the Manila-based blog 'combined Perez Hilton's fondness for coke-y MS Paint doodles with TMZ's gutter ruthlessness with 2005-era Gawker's weakness for the unverified and unverifiable, juicy reader tip'. Many of the blog's subjects were people who were associated with the blogger. An anonymous former editor of Bryanboy said of the blogger's supposed involvement: 'It was just common knowledge in Manila among those who were in the know.' According to New York magazine, the blogger earns more than $100,000 per year. He charges fees for appearances, telling the magazine: 'But if it's something or somebody that I support, then of course I'm not going to charge. 'For me money is really not the issue, it's about getting material and getting my content.' Using the alias Bboy777, he joined the blogosphere in 2003 and eventually built a following for himself after posting stories about his weight-loss goals, fashion purchases and hatred for fake designer goods. Both are themes that feature on his newer blog. He wrote a short-lived fashion column for a publication called the Philippines Star and he also guest-judged the Philippines' version of Project Runway. He has built impressive connections since setting his sights on the U.S. Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is just one magazine editor who has commissioned street style photographs off the blogger. New digs: The blogger tweeted this picture with the caption, 'My building to the left... my street view to the right' Success: His blog Bryanboy.com, above, is said to attract an average of 1.4million pge views every month . Fashion bible Style.com also featured his photography during the Fall/Winter 2012 Fashion Week season earlier this year. His blog, which features his witty commentary on fashion as well as photographs and self-portraits is said to average 1.4million page views per month.","It makes him the first fashion blogger to become a mainstream TV star .

"By . Martha De Lacey . Whose clothes are you're lusting after this week? Kate Moss's coat? Cara Delevingne's cape? The Duchess of Cambridge's clutch? Or a pair of ankle boots worn by the girl sitting opposite you on the eastbound District line? Well, lust no more. A team of technology whizz-kids at a company based at Imperial College, London, are developing a fashion-finding app enabling users to 'Shazam' outfits by taking photos of them, whereupon they will be shown a selection of options for buying the same or similar items. The Find Similar service has been created by the team at Cortexica, a leading provider of visual search and image recognition technology for mobile devices, based in South Kensington. Dress like a Duchess: A team of internet whizz-kids at a company based at Imperial College, London, are developing fashion-finding technology to enable users to dress like their idols . The technology allows you to find items of clothing that are similar in style to that which appears on your camera, meaning you no longer have to trawl the internet and play detective when you want to find out where Angelina got her dress or Claudia her scarf. Cortexica spokesman Steve Semenzato told MailOnline: 'The company is four years old, and before that we did seven years of research at Imperial College. Agroup of Bio-engineers at Imperial figured out the technology. 'When we started the company we were doing a lot of work in the grocery sector, with companies like Tesco - technology that enabled you to take photos of items in your fridge and find the exact match online. But that was exact matches, and over the year we developed an evolution of that: find similar.' The company soon realised that the best application for their new technology was fashion, 'because it's so difficult to describe items of clothing things in words and search for them on the internet'. 'But if you show someone a picture', continued Steve, 'you can see exactly what they're talking about.' He continued: 'Where colour, pattern and texture are involved find similar is very good. So you can enter photographs of friends, celebrities, magazines, and the database will hunt for similar matches, and find the exact one if it's there. 'The bigger the database the better the matches, so we're currently talking to some very big retailers who have lots of images. And hopefully we'll be helping people.' Like Cara's dress? The new technology will bring up options for similar dresses, most of which will be more within the budget of the average non-model . The Cortexia team - who describe themselves as 'the engine behind the scenes' - are taking their technology to people who run apps and websites where there might be an application for it. They said: 'The application of this technology is set to revolutionise the online and mobile fashion marketplace. 'With . it, retailers and major brand-owners are enabling their customers to . start their individual searches for clothing or accessories - by just by . taking a picture.' They continued: 'Fashion is all about style, image and inspiration. Either from magazines pictures, street-style images, photos of friends' outfits or specific shop window styles you may see in the high street. 'Cortexica's Find Similar mobile image search gives you the opportunity to be inspired by what you see around you just by taking a picture and asking the system to find what you are looking for. 'Finding items couldn't be simpler, as traditional text based search or drop down category specific menu searches will never uncover what you are looking for.' Cortexia's development follows rumours in April that Shazam - the British mobile phone music identification service - were developing a similar app. Be a Copy-Kelly: Kelly Brook's style can now be completely your own, as by using the technology you can find similar items of clothing just by taking a photograph . A spokesman for Shazam told MailOnline: 'Shazam is not working on a new app for fashion. But, we currently have a merchandising feature incorporated in our television tag result - when you use Shazam to tag any show on 160 channels in the States, you can get information on the cast and show, including trivia, music in the broadcast, cast listing, etc. 'Currently, that merchandising feature lets people buy show-related items, which sometimes includes clothing similar to that which is featured in the program. Our Executive Chair Andrew Fisher was referring to our plans to continue innovating around that feature, which is already in play. 'Having said that, fashion houses could quite easily work with Shazam to make their catwalk shows Shazam-enabled. 'In fact, right after the clothes featured in catwalk shows, the music is the next thing that people talk about - and Shazam is frequently mentioned in Vogue, Garage and other top tier fashion magazines. 'Fashion houses could partner with Shazam to incorporate information about their new line or other products so that when people use Shazam to tag the music in the show, they are able to browse the styles they see or view scents, accessories or other items.' Mad for The Moss: Get your hands on all of Kate's looks with Cortexica's new fashion-hunting technology that links you to similar items . Listen up: Shazam have denied rumours they too are developing an app specifically for locating fashion items, though a version of the service is available in America via their TV 'tagging' function . 'Shazam it': Shazam allows you to identify music and even objects - including furniture and clothes - in TV shows .","Find Similar service created .

"By . Bianca London . If news that Kate Moss working on a new collection for Topshop wasn’t enough, the High Street mecca has another celebrity collaboration to celebrate. After the stellar success of her first collection with the brand, the perennially cool Kate Bosworth is back for round two. The actress has unveiled a chic line of pared-back designs made with high-end fabrics and some serious style credentials. Round two: Kate Bosworth, known and loved for her perennially cool style, is back with a second collection for Topshop .

"By . Ruth Styles . From Jennifer Lawrence to Khloe Kardashian, even A-listers aren't immune to uncomfortable and embarrassing camel toe. But now it seems that the days of suffering in silence could be at an end thanks to Belfast inventor, Collette McCrarren. Ms McCrarren has designed an innovative set of underwear named bodiBase that includes a patented gusset fabricated to hold its shape and fend off camel toe. Scroll down for video . Smooth operator: The bodiBase knickers have a reinforced gusset to help prevent unsightly camel toe . Embarrassing: Both Jennifer Lawrence and Khloe Kardashian have confessed to struggling with camel toe . The underwear is also made from a special silver-infused fabric, which, claims McCrarren, has anti-bacterial and odour-eliminating properties. Now McCrarren hopes to put the knickers into production with a little help from crowd-funding website, Kickstarter, and is looking for £25,000 in total. On the website, she explains how she hit upon the idea and reveals that it came about after finding it impossible to unearth sports underwear that didn't leave her feeling 'paranoid'. 'The idea for bodiBase came from my own personal frustrations with inadequate underwear,' explains the former dental technician. Innovative: Collette says she hopes to expand the range should she raise enough money on Kickstarter . Speaking to MailOnline, she added: 'My hope for bodiBase is to see it succeed on Kickstarter so I can prove to retailers that there is a market for this fantastic product. 'I really hope that women hear about my project and support it so I can work on other products such as swimwear and gym clothing. I am still working full-time as a dental technician to help me get bodiBase out into the market. 'What keeps me going with bodiBase is the interest I've had from women that play sport, go to the gym, who compete in dressage and just normal everyday women that wear leggings/tight clothing, not only here in the UK but in Australia and the USA. 'I know that if women get to know that bodiBase is available, it will be something they will want to have. I really do hope that this could be the start of a business and a brand. 'It would be wonderful for bodiBase to take off as it has been designed and will be made right here in the UK which will lead to creating jobs and bringing British manufacturing back.' Those who back the project can expect to be among the first to get their hands on the underwear, with both thong and short versions offered to backers.

"By . Deborah Arthurs . When Vanessa Buckley set up her own acting agency she thought her two children would be the first in the limelight. But in fact it was the family dog which landed a leading role in London Fashion Week. The Buckley's pet Ebenezer, an eight-year-old blue whippet, made his debut on the catwalk at the glittering London Fashion Week event for luxury brand Mulberry. But he was not alone in his stage debut as he had 14 pet friends to join him in the forest-themed campaign. Fashion hounds: Vanessa Buckley set up an acting agency with the intention of making her children famous - but after adding photos of her dogs to the site she found there was a demand for them tooo . Vanessa, of Greetland, West Yorkshire, said: 'I set up my own casting agency Vada after running a drama school for twelve months.

'I have one and so does my friend so I emailed them and sent in their pictures. 'It all went from there. We didn't find out all the details until much nearer the time. 'They asked for the dogs' collar sizes and then we had to sign a secrecy agreement so that gave us an indication it was a big event. 'We were met at Claridges hotel and the dogs were given a run through on the set. Famous! Cara Delevingne with Vanessa's dog Ebenezer, left of Cara, and her friend's dog, Layla . 'It was a forest theme so they tested them out with the dry ice and the loud music and photographers and they were absolutely fine with it all. 'It was for the launch of the new Mulberry handbag and the face of the brand Cara Delevingne was on stage with the blue whippets. 'There were 15 in total for the event which was in Claridges' ballroom. 'The dogs all had their own handlers. We realised how serious it was when we tried to leave the set for an hour and couldn't get out for all the paparazzi trying to get in!' But for now Vanessa is happy for her pet pooch to be signed on the books and he now has a Mulberry collar to show for his efforts. Vanessa, who lives with her husband Matthew and their two children James, 16, and Lucy, 14, added: 'It's another string to our bow.'

A mother gave birth to seven babies while hiding the pregnancy from her husband and strangled them to death immediately after they were born, authorities said today.

West . pleaded guilty in federal court in 2005 to two counts of possessing . chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine, court . records show. In August 2006, he was sentenced to nine years in prison, . but appealed the term three times. He maintained his innocence and said . he never had any intention to manufacture meth. It is unclear when he . was released. West's sister Sarah Wright wrote to federal district court in 2006, saying West is a good father to his three daughters. 'Darren is such an awesome dad,' she wrote. The . gruesome case has raised a series of questions about how the killings . occurred despite Huntsman carrying out what neighbors seemed like a . normal existence. Horrible job: An unidentified man was seen going in and out of the Pleasant Grove house on Monday . Police declined to comment on a motive and what Huntsman said during an interview with investigators. Police Capt. Michael Roberts said . officers responded to a call from West on Saturday about a dead infant, . and then they found the six other bodies. Family and neighbors identified the estranged husband as Darren West, who has been in prison on drug-related charges. Roberts said police believe West and Huntsman were together when the babies were born. 'We don't believe he had any knowledge of the situation,' Roberts told The Associated Press . Asked how the man could not have known about the situation, Roberts replied, . 'That's the million-dollar question. Amazing.' Huntsman . moved out several years ago, leaving her three daughters, one teenager . and two young adults, to live alone, their neighbors the Hawkers said. They weren't sure where Huntsman has since been living. What she did: Huntsman has been charged with six counts of murder, but it is unclear why she has not been charged with seven since that many bodies were found . Years ago, Huntsman baby-sat the Hawker grandchildren and they were friendly with each other. 'It makes us so sad, we want to cry,' Kathie Hawker said. 'We enjoyed having them as a neighbor. This has just blown us away.' Aaron Hawker said he talked with West on Saturday morning. He told Hawker he was cleaning out the mess in the garage. 'Two hours later, suddenly we had all these policemen here,' Aaron Hawker said. Fred . Newman, a neighbor whose cousin is the husband's mother, said he's . perplexed how the three oldest daughters living there didn't know about . what police say was going on. Bracing for the worst: The estranged husband had only found one of the seven bodies when police arrived . On . the scene: Authorities investigate a crime scene where they say seven . dead infants were found in the former home of Megan Huntsman . Chain of custody: Megan Huntsman had been living in the home that legally belongs to her estranged husband's parents . Not a suspect: West had just returned to the Pleasant Grove home after spending time in jail . He said the girls didn't always park their cars in the garage, but did sometimes in the cold winter months. 'What's shocking is the three older ones living there and not noticing that their mother was pregnant,' Newman said. He said he has used his snow-blower to clean off the driveway of the home and the young women would thank him. The girls were normal youngsters, coming and going often, neighbor Vickie Nelson said. 'It's shocking and kind of morbid and strange,' Nelson said as he looked across the street at the garage from her from lawn.","Megan Huntsman, 39, is in police custody after her estranged husband found the dead body of an infant in their garage .

"By . Sam Webb . A Danish woman has defied being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis to run 366 marathons in 365 days. Annette Fredskov, 41, who has two children, Emilie, 11, and Viktor, 9, with husband Ulrich, ran 26.2 miles every day for a year and topped off her heroic feat of endurance with a double marathon on July 14. Dozens of supporters ran with Mrs Fredskov as she completed her arduous journey in her home town of Naestved, which is an hour south of capital Copenhagen. MS sufferer Annette Fredskov (centre, white vest) has run an incredible 366 marathons in 365 days . High five: Crowds turned out to support Mrs Fredskov's final run of the year and many supporters ran with her . Three years ago she was diagnosed with the condition, which affects the central nervous system and can cause crippling pain, numerous muscle problems, fatigue and a host of other debilitating effects. But Mrs Fredskov, who described herself as an 'ordinary woman, mother and wife' refused to bow to the condition and took up running, taking part in her first marathon in Frankfurt, Germany, in October 2010 - an event she described as 'love at first run'. In early 2011, she began to take part in a series of small marathons in Denmark known as 'cannonballs' and by the end of the year she had run 51 of them. After she crossed the line. bringing her epic ordeal to an emotional close, she said: 'It has been a completely wonderful day. My dream has come true, and it can not be described with words. 'It has been a gigantic feast of running and I am completely overwhelmed, happy, grateful and tired.' Stoic: Mrs Fredskov refuses to let the condition affect her life . She credits the marathons, which she completes in around five hours, for her well-being and ability to cope with the disease. Annette Fredskov meets the world's media after completing two marathons in one day, her 365th and 366th of the past year . Mrs Fredskov said she wants her efforts to inspire others diagnosed with the condition. However, the day after her joy was mixed with extreme fatigue. She wrote in her blog: 'When I woke up this morning, I felt like I was run over by a steamroller. Flat, tired and heavy.' Mrs Fredskov said that one of the reasons she began her gruelling challenge was to inspire other MS sufferers . She said: 'It should not deter you from living life to the fullest and going for your dreams. 'It is my hope that I am able to inspire others to do what they dream about.' Arduous: The pain of more than 50 miles of running in one day takes its toll . She said: 'Marathons are the best things that have happened to my body and soul' She credits the marathons, which she completes in around five hours, for her well-being and ability to cope with the disease. 'Three years ago I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and today I have - without drugs - no discomfort or symptoms. I believe that racing and the marathons have a big impact on that,' she said. 'Two years ago, I thought the same thing most people think: ""Running a marathon isn’t healthy. A marathon is damaging to the body and it takes a long time to recover"". 'I have now changed my mind. Marathons are the best things that have happened to my body and soul.' Mrs Fredskov (centre, lying down) and her supporters pose for a picture after the year-long ordeal comes to an end . Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a condition of the central nervous system. It is the most common disabling neurological disease among young adults and affects around 100,000 people in the UK. Side effects vary case to case but include muscle weakness and spasms, reduced coordination and balance, speech problems, fatigue, chronic pain and depression . MS is most often diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 40, and women are almost twice as likely to develop it as men. Once diagnosed, MS stays with you for life, but treatments and specialists can help sufferers to manage many symptoms. The cause is not known and a cure has yet to be identified.","Annette Fredskov was diagnosed with the condition in 2010 .
The mother-of-two's act of defiance to MS was to begin running .
She has now completed a marathon a day - plus one more - for a year .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Fay Hand, 37, has taken phone giant EE to a tribunal because she claims she was unfairly dismissed . A call centre manager is suing mobile phone giant EE after claiming she was sacked because a member of her team kicked another employee until they were unconscious. Fay Hand, 37, was dismissed from the firm's Darlington-based centre because she was said not to have done enough to tackle bullying and harassment among employees under her. The mother-of-two has now taken EE to a tribunal, claiming unfair dismissal after working at the company for 17 years. The hearing was told an investigation was launched after one of the 100 staff under the operations manager kicked a colleague at his desk, knocking him unconscious last October. In mitigation after the event, the employee told bosses he lashed out because he had been provoked, and said the month previously colleagues had pinched his car keys and removed a Fifa computer game from his car. He claimed he had been harassed at work, that the game was held to ransom and that there had been a fake disciplinary hearing about it. The call centre staff were skilled members of the EE team with a higher technical knowledge of the network system, and better paid than regular call handlers, the hearing heard. Mrs Hand, from Teesside, knew about the incident with the game being taken from the car, and delegated it to a junior manager to deal with. EE claimed she should have followed up the incident as a senior manager, and made sure it was properly dealt with, as it had an 'almost zero' tolerance of harassment and bullying. Seven employees were sacked as a result of the incident - including the man who kicked his colleague, the victim and their team leader. John Mitton, representing the claimant, told the tribunal at Teesside Magistrates' Court: 'We believe that the punishment being summary dismissal is completely disproportionate for someone with this amount of service and an exemplary record. 'At the very worst, a final warning should have been issued.' Damian Robson, for EE, told the hearing: 'The respondent has identified banter as a dangerous pastime for the business. 'However, no decent employer would want a sterile environment to work within. However, that must be clearly managed. 'The claimant is the person tasked with carefully managing that. She did not.' The tribunal at Teesside Magistrates' Court (above) was told how an investigation into Mrs Hand was launched after one of the 100 staff under her kicked a colleague at his desk, knocking him unconscious last October . EE was a company which had to protect its brand and public image 'to a strenuous, sensitive degree,' he argued. The tribunal judge Gerald Johnson reserved judgment for two weeks. After the hearing, Mrs Hand wept as she recalled her time with the firm, which she said had made her a 'scapegoat'. She said: 'I put an awful lot of time and effort into that job. I loved it and everyone who worked with me would vouch for that.' She said EE had sacked seven other people before she was fired, adding: 'I think they considered it would be fair to issue the same treatment. I would argue it is not.'","Fay Hand was dismissed from EE call centre in Darlington, county Durham .

"By . Katy Winter . From talking owls to controversial rappers, TK Maxx is known for pushing boundaries when it comes to advertising campaigns. And it would seem that the brand's advertising team haven't lost their touch, after casting not one but two pensioners in the Christmas campaign. Along with adorable children and pretty women, the TV advert stars veteran actor Paul Collard, 95, and evergreen beauty Daphne Selfe, 85, appears in an accompanying video. Veteran star: At 92, actor Paul Collard is significantly older than the other models appearing in the advert . Perfect present: 85-year-old model Daphne Selfe is seen talking about her ideal gift . Collard, 92, is seen looking dapper in a tweed jacket, light blue shirt and striped maroon tie in the advert, titled The Moment. Standing next to a Christmas tree his face lights up with joy at opening his present as he throws his head back in unbridled laughter. Miss Selfe, meanwhile, appears in an accompanying film looking glamorous in a grey and black jumper, black coat and silver jewellery and upon being asked what the most perfect gift she has ever received is, answers simply: ‘A beautiful garment.' But few can match the achievements of Miss Selfe, who began her modelling career more than 60 years ago. Heartwarming: The short film focuses on the moment when you receive a carefully chosen present . Diversity: Along with Collard and Selfe, The Moment features a wide range of models of varying ages . Festive: The Christmas campaign was directed by James Strong, best known for BBC drama Broadchurch . Silver-haired Miss Selfe has starred in countless catwalk extravaganzas, campaigns and magazine spreads during her career and recently appeared in Channel 4 documentary Fabulous Fashionistas which profiled some of the UK's most glamorous pensioners. Talking about her style she said: 'I have and wear a lot of vintage clothes and it is how I have always dressed. I still have my ‘going away suit’ which I bought in Madrid in the ‘50’s. 'It’s thick white brocade cotton and can be put in the washing machine. It’s had several ‘updates’ over the years but is still as good as ever and I would hate to part with it. And her top tip for negotiating a visit to TK Maxx? 'Definitely to go when you are feeling fit and energetic - there's a lot of choice!’ High Street megastore TK Maxx is famous for its labels for less ethos and for its groundbreaking campaigns .

"By . Margot Peppers . A new trend is seeing men wearing increasingly short shorts, with clothing companies following suit in order to meet demand. While the Nineties and early Aughts may have been about keeping covered up in knee-skimming bottoms, these days it's becoming more and more fashionable for men to flaunt their thighs - as evidenced by street-stylers and celebrities including Pharrell and Penn Badgley. The craze is especially relevant in an age where muscle-building work-outs like CrossFit and SoulCycle are all the rage - which Rainer Castillo says he had in mind when he co-founded men's clothing company Chubbies. Who wears short shorts? A new trend is seeing men wearing increasingly short shorts. Pictured: Celebrity fans Pharrell, left, at the Oscars in March, and Penn Badgley, right, at Coachella in April . Following suit: Even middle-aged stars like Hugh Jackman, 45, (left) and 50-year-old Russell Crowe (right) have hopped on the above-the-knee bandwagon . 'We spend too much time in the gym to hide under frumpy shorts that say, ""I don't care how I look,""' Mr Castillo told the Wall Street Journal. Instead, his San Francisco-based company, which he started in 2011 with three other men in their twenties, specializes in shorts that are stylishly shorter. Indeed, Chubbies exclusively sells shorts with a five-and-a-half-inch inseam, which falls just in the middle of the thigh. Unlike the slouchy and disheveled cargo shorts of yesteryear, Chubbies' modern ones are 'comfortable, flexible, aerodynamic and most of all utterly radical,' reads the website. 'They are weekend BBQs in the sun. They are that perfect day on the beach.' Bonobos is . another mens retailer that has hopped on the short shorts bandwagon. At . the e-commerce company's 'guideshops', they sell chino shorts in four . different inseam lengths: 11, nine, seven and five inches. Higher and higher: Bonobos sells chino shorts in four different inseam lengths: 11, nine, seven (left) and five inches (right), the last of which is most popular with twenty-something men . Thigh-skimming: At Ralph Lauren, shorts that fall above the knee are more the norm than the exception, with inseams ranging between a conservative nine-and-a-half inches (left) to a more daring six (right) The modern fit is more tailored and less tight than the short shorts of the Seventies and Eighties - like the bright gym shorts favored by Richard Simmons and Slater's denim cut-offs in Saved By The Bell. 'I just don't like the longer lengths - they cut off your body in a strange place' Today, according to Dwight Fenton, the vice president of design at Bonobos, different types of men tend to gravitate towards different lengths. Those who opt for five inches are 'the same young guys wearing the slim-cut suits,' who are often in their twenties, he said. The 11-inch inseams, on the other hand, . are preferred by teens who may be less comfortable revealing too much . leg, as well as less interested in being on-trend. Showing off: 'We spend too much time in the gym to hide under frumpy shorts,' said Chubbies co-founder Rainer Castillo. Pictured: Chubbies shorts, which all have a five-and-a-half-inch inseam . Modern take: Unlike the slouchy and disheveled cargo shorts of yesteryear, Chubbies' modern ones are 'comfortable, flexible, aerodynamic and most of all utterly radical,' reads the website . J Crew also offers four lengths of shorts - five, seven, nine and ten-and-a-half inches. At Ralph Lauren, too, men's shorts that fall above the knee are more the norm than the exception, with inseams ranging between a conservative nine-and-a-half inches to a more daring six. Atlanta-based designer Sid Mashburn, who owns his own eponymous menswear label, says the logic behind short shorts for men is simple - they're more flattering. 'I just don't like the longer lengths,' he explained. 'They cut off your body in a strange place.' As if! Long gone are the days where boys would 'just fall out of bed and put on some baggy pants,' in the words of Cher Horowitz from 1995 movie Clueless (pictured: a scene from the film)","Inseams are currently trendiest at between five-and-a-half and eight inches, instead of the 11 inches that have been popular for the past two decades .

"By . Misty White Sidell . Gwyneth Paltrow is the latest celebrity to be spotted with a piece from Chanel’s spray painted ‘Grafitti’ collection. The newly-single actress, 41, was seen carrying the $3,800 tote at New York’s JFK airport on Wednesday. She follows in the footsteps of Miley Cyrus, Diane Kruger, Lily Allen, Kristen Stewart, Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian, all of whom have been seen carrying the backpack version, which costs upwards of $3,400. The 'It' bag: Chanel's Graffiti tote, seen her on Gwyneth Paltrow on Wednesday, is shaping up to be the bag of the season . Close-up: The bag is meant to resemble an art student's tote with graffiti, handmade lanyards, and frayed edges . Despite its popularity among the A-list, however, the collection has been much derided for its distressed, handmade appearance. Presented as part of Chanel’s spring 2014 collection, the bag is intended to look like an art student’s school tote with tears, paint splotches, handcrafted lanyards, and an overall distressed feel. It is also, of course, covered in the brand’s signature ‘CC’ logo. Indeed, last month, the Daily Mail’s Alice Smellie helped her five-year-old daughter make a replica for just £7 ($12). This general opinion does not seem to have hampered sales though. A call to the Chanel store in New York’s SoHo revealed that the entire graffiti bag collection is sold out worldwide. The Chanel sales associate told MailOnline: ‘It wasn’t even that bad, the price,’ attributing their popularity to a lower-than-average cost. On the runway: The bag was presented as part of Chanel's spring 2014 show in Paris . Backpacker: The label's Grafitti backback has been spotted on a slew of stylish celebrities including Miley Cyrus (right) and Diane Kruger (left) Many consumers, however, do not agree. Commenters on Purse Blog were widely offended by the bag’s price. A reader named Laura wrote: ‘These canvas bags are an insult.’ Another commenter named Kagem wrote: ‘Karl [Lagerfeld] could put the CC logo on a garbage bin and people would lap it up as some abstract monument of his genius… I'm getting tired of Karl’s weird sense of humour for the bags... It does look like a bag you can make with Crayola.’ And a reader who goes by LadyLiz said: ‘I really don't think it's worth the $3,400 price tag for splattered paint and a Chanel logo written in white out ....Thanks Karl, but no Thanks...you won't get us this time..next! [sic]’ The clan: Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian were both seen in the bags on separate trips to LAX . The celebrities who have been seen with the bags demonstrate various ways of styling it. Kristen Stewart and Diane Kruger – both likely gifted the bags by Chanel – have an understated approach. Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, styled the backpack with a glam-rock aesthetic, wearing it last month in New York City with an oversize army green jacket, white sweatpants, and combat boots. And leave it to the Kardashian clan to take the most straightforward glam-o-rama approach. Kourtney Kardashian toted the backpack at LAX in early March – along with practical airport attire like netted stiletto boots and skin-tight skinny jeans. Rebels: Kristen Stewart (left) and Lily Allen (right) both took their signature dressed-down approach to the backpack . Mother Kris Jenner also carried the backpack just a few days earlier at LAX, after returning from a trip to Asia. Like her daughter, Kris wore the purse with an all-black ensemble, but with more comfort in mind. In lieu of stilettos, she wore slip-on velvet sneakers. Other fans of the bag include Lily Allen, who carried the backpack earlier this month, as well as Ashley Tisdale who was seen with it as she arrived in LAX following her Miami bachelorette party last weekend.","The graffiti-themed bag collection has been mocked for its disheveled ‘art student’ appearance .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Children who grew up with parents addicted to drink and drugs have revealed the terrifying toll it took on their childhood. While their homes should have been a place of safety and refuge, for Leanne and John (not their real names) they were associated with fear. Her situation due to her often drunk single mother became so bad that Leanne, from London, ran away from home at the age of just 11. Volatile: Leanne was so scared of her mother when she'd had a drink, she ran away age 11 preferring to sleep rough than be at home (pictures posed by models) She told MailOnline: 'I never knew my dad and I was an . only child. My mum and I led a very chaotic lifestyle: one year we lived in 12 . different places. The houses were all in bad condition and always dirty. 'My . relationship with my mum wasn't good. She'd had two or three partners who she had turbulent . relationships with. There were loads of rows, sometimes violent ones late into the night. Things were smashed and at the weekend she would . drink heavily. 'I was frightened of her when she was drunk as she was . very unpredictable. I was really stressed and not sleeping. I felt . isolated. There was no-one to turn to, only my mum, and that wasn't . working. It all got too much for me, I was utterly miserable, so I ran . away from home. I was an 11-year-old girl wandering around by myself at night and I was scared.' She added: 'It was freezing and I was terrified that someone would hurt me. But frightened as I was, I couldn't face going home.' It was thanks to Childline that she didn't have to sleep rough. They tried to help her reestablish a relationship with her mother but when that failed, they found her a refuge and then a foster home to stay in till she was 16. ...At school I'd hear people talk about the fun things they did with their parents and I'd think ""why can't I have that?"" She said: Through all those difficult years . ChildLine was there for me. If they hadn't helped me when I ran away and . I was alone in the park overnight I shudder to think what could have . happened to me. 'Whenever things got really bad, I called them and they . helped me through it. ChildLine always listened to me and believed what I . said and having my counsellor at the end of the phone made me feel as . though I mattered and there was always someone there for me. I really . don't know what I would have done without ChildLine.' Meanwhile, John's experience growing up with a drug addict father is equally heartbreaking. John, from Grimsby, who is now 18, said: 'I . knew from a young age that my life was different to other children. I'd see my . dad fall over or just be asleep on the sofa by 6pm. I used to think ""why is he . falling asleep, he's done nothing all day so why is he tired?"" I'd sit next to . him and clap or make another noise, anything just to try and keep him awake as . I knew something wasn't right. 'We . always used to have lots of people in the house too. They'd arrive at weird times like 2am or 6am . and they'd be really noisy. My dad had told me that my mother was in prison for . drugs and I slowly began to realise as I got older that he was a drug user too.' John said as a result of his father's problem, he lived in squalor and fear. But it was only when he went to a school friend's house that he realise how different his life was to his peers. Concern: ChildLine carried out 5,323 counselling sessions with children worried about their parents' abuse of drink or drugs - up from 2,509 the previous year . He said: 'I remember going to a friend's house and his family all sat up to be table for the meal and I thought ""what are they doing?"" I wasn't used to being in a family environment and spending time with family. 'At home our lives were very separate as I'd spend a lot of time in my room to get away from my dad and his friends who were taking drugs downstairs. He would never come and tuck me in, instead he'd pass out on the sofa. He added: 'When I went to friends' houses I realised that they had more things than me, like playstations and mobiles, and I didn't understand why I couldn't have them. I felt lost and lonely. 'At school I'd hear people talk about the fun things they did with their parents and I'd think ""why can't I have that?"" There was only a couple of friends who I trusted that came inside my house as I didn't want others to see what state it was in. Some of their parents wouldn't let me them come round as they knew my dad was doing drugs.' John recalls one particularly horrific experience. 'When I was about nine, a man overdosed in my house. I remember walking upstairs and seeing him on the floor in our bathroom next to some heroin and a needle covered in blood. I didn't know what to do and I was scared but my dad just told me to go to my room,' he said. It was shortly after this that he found salvation via Childline. He was referred to the NSPCC's FEDUP programme which does group work with children whose parents have drug or alcohol problems. He said: 'I was a bit nervous the first time I went as I knew why I was there but I didn't know what to expect. I loved it straight away as it helped me to realise that I wasn't the only person in that situation - other young people were going through the same thing.' Leanne and John have shared her story after figures released today by Childline have shown a shock rise in the number of children contacting them about their parents' drinking and drug-taking. The number of children counselled by ChildLine because their parents were drinking too much - or taking drugs - has more than doubled last year, averaging 15 counselling sessions a day to the free, 24-hour helpline. ChildLine carried out 5,323 counselling sessions with children worried about their parents' abuse of drink or drugs - up from 2,509 the previous year. ...When I was about nine, a man overdosed . in my house. I remember walking upstairs and seeing him on the floor in . our bathroom next to some heroin and a needle covered in blood . Most of the children counselled were 12 to 15 years old, although one in 10 were of primary school age. The figures contrast with a long-term fall in violent crime in England and Wales, thought to be partially influenced by the rising cost of alcohol. The charity said further research is needed to explain the sudden increase but it would appear that more children are witnessing drunken behaviour and experiencing violence at home, or they are more aware that help is available. Many children told ChildLine that they lived in fear of their parents' anger, with one in six saying they'd been physically hurt by their mother or father when they were under the influence. Some reported living in dirty and even dangerous surroundings, lacking essentials because money was frittered on alcohol or drugs. Children spoke of feeling helpless and not knowing where to go for support. Shock rise: More children are witnessing drunken behaviour and experiencing violence at home according to statistics from Childline (posed by models) Sue Minto, Head of ChildLine, said: 'These shocking ChildLine statistics are sadly only one small piece of the jigsaw. Official estimates are that more than 250,000 children in the UK have parents with drug problems, and three in 10 children live with at least one binge-drinking parent. 'It's heart-breaking that so many young people struggle alone because they do not know where to go for help or are unsure of what might happen if they speak to someone. They may fear being taken away from their families by social services and put into care and believe that they are protecting their family by keeping quiet. 'Some children tell us their parents are under stress and it may be that they are using drink and drugs to blot out worries about jobs, money or housing issues. But whatever the reasons behind the rise, it's vital that anyone who knows a parent with drink or drug problems takes action to get that family help so that their children are protected.' John said the support of the charity was invaluable to him. He explained: 'It was good to have the NSPCC in my life as they provided me with a consistency that was missing at home and gave me someone to talk to. 'Going there made me want to help other people and I started to help deliver the FEDUP sessions to other young people. I’m also going to university to do a social worker degree.' Children can seek help by contacting ChildLine on 0800 1111 or at childline.org.uk. Adults with concerns about a child should call the NSPCC helpline on 0808 800 5000.","Leanne ran away from home age 11 .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Daniel Martin . Authority: The former top tax official in the country, Dave Hartnett, has accepted a job with major accountancy firm Deloitte . The former taxman whose ‘sweetheart deals’ allowed Starbucks and Vodafone to avoid billions in payments sparked fury yesterday by switching sides to work for the firms’ accountants. Dave Hartnett was attacked over his lucrative contract with City giant Deloitte, which he has accepted just ten months after retiring from his post as head of HM Revenue and Customs. Experts said the move raises serious questions about the ‘cosy’ relationship between the Revenue and big companies accused of tax avoidance. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, accused Mr Hartnett of ‘greed’ and ‘losing all sense of what is right’. Critics said it was little surprise that the  62-year-old had been ‘welcomed with open arms’ by the same firm which had helped big business avoid huge amounts of tax every year. Deloitte dismissed any suggestion that Mr Hartnett had been hired to reveal insider secrets of how to beat the taxman and insisted there was no conflict of interest in the appointment. Mr Hartnett’s tenure at HMRC, which ended last July, was dogged by claims that he helped multinational companies shave millions of pounds off their tax bills. He was severely criticised for brokering a deal that saved Goldman Sachs £20million in interest payments. The deal was described by a judge last month as lawful, but ‘not a glorious episode in the history of the Revenue’. Another time, Mr Hartnett allowed Vodafone – a Deloitte client – to pay £1.25billion of an alleged £6billion tax bill – figures which are disputed by the telecoms company. After being accused of lying to MPs last year, Mr Hartnett left HMRC and joined HSBC as an adviser on honesty. Sick: Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge condemned the move by Mr Hartnett to join Deloitte . He has now accepted a one-day-a-week . post with Deloitte – the firm that signed off the accounts for coffee . chain Starbucks which, entirely legally, paid no corporation tax for . three years by channelling its revenues through Luxembourg and . Switzerland. During his time as HMRC boss, Mr . Hartnett met Deloitte’s senior British partner David Cruickshank 48 . times between 2007 and 2011, including meetings about Vodafone. Mr Hartnett’s appointment with . Deloitte was approved by David Cameron and the advisory committee set up . to monitor the ‘revolving door’ between Whitehall and money-spinning . jobs in the private sector. It is subject to six caveats, . including a requirement to ensure Mr Hartnett does not ‘draw on . privileged information’ from his time at HMRC. The Deloitte buildings in New Street Square in London, where Mr Hartnett will work one day a week. File picture . But Mrs Hodge said: ‘Doesn’t it make . you sick? It is terrible when people’s individual greed means they lose . all sense of what’s right. ‘He better than most knows this isn’t . about paying a fair share of tax and playing by the rules. It is about . manipulating the rules and aggressively avoiding tax. ‘We always called the deals he reached sweetheart deals. Maybe now we understand why.’ Fellow Labour MP John Mann added: ‘It shouldn’t be allowed.’ Murray Wood, spokesman for the group . UK Uncut, which campaigns against corporate tax avoidance, said: ‘It is . no surprise Dave Hartnett has been welcomed with open arms by a company . which has helped firms like Starbucks avoid huge amounts of tax every . year. ‘Governments have for years had a far . too cosy relationship with giant corporate tax dodgers and the tax . avoidance industry. It means the UK is losing out on millions of pounds . of revenue which could be spent on public services.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘David Hartnett’s appointment doesn’t . look good given how the Revenue appeared to reach decisions in a number . of controversial cases, especially while many others were left to . struggle under the weight of Britain’s hideously complex  tax code.’ Deloitte pledged that Mr Hartnett ‘will not work with UK companies or with HMRC’ in his new role. A spokesman said: ‘He will work as a . consultant to Deloitte advising foreign governments and tax . administrations, primarily in the developing world. ‘He has significant experience in advising such countries on the development of effective tax regimes.’ Advice: Starbucks and Vodafone, which have both faced questions over their tax in the UK, are advised by Deloitte which has just hired Mr Hartnett . Yesterday the Cabinet Office said Mr Hartnett had ‘complied with the rules’. Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘The . recommendation was made by the entirely independent Advisory Committee . on Business Appointments, and the Prime Minister follows their advice.’ It approved the appointment subject to . conditions stipulating Mr Hartnett must not advise ‘any taxpayer that . he has been involved with whilst at HMRC’, nor have ‘involvement in . discussions with other fiscal authorities of UK’s confidential tax . policy’. However, critics pointed out that a condition banning him from . ‘lobbying Government’ on behalf of Deloitte expires in July 2014. Paul Flynn, a Labour member of the . Commons public administration committee, branded the advisory body ‘a . pussy cat without teeth or claws’ and ‘virtually completely useless’. He said: ‘It’s not what people do when . they retire that is the problem, it’s what they did when they were in . office. They may well take a soft line on the commercial companies that . they hope to be employed by post-retirement. ‘The revolving door is more corrupt than the financial scandals we’ve had.’ There was no answer at Mr Hartnett’s £800,000 home near St Albans last night.","Dave Hartnett will work with accountancy giant Deloitte for one day a week .

"By . Katy Winter . Most women dream of an hourglass figure - but for Penny Brown it has become an obsession. Inspired by voluptuous cartoon character Jessica Rabbit, Penny has sculpted her bust to twice the size of her waist. In the last two years, 25-year-old Penny has had two boob jobs taking her from an H to an O cup. And the military wife has shrunk her waist from 38 to a tiny 23 inches by squeezing into rib-crushing corsets for up to 23 hours a day. What a character: Penny Brown in her corset at her home in Okinawa, Japan . The character Jessica Rabbit appeared in the hit movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988 . Penny, who has been obsessed by Jessica Rabbit since childhood, first wore a corset to take some sexy pictures for her husband and became fascinated by the way it transformed her body . But despite her extreme proportions, she has no plans to stop. She is now preparing for her third boob job and hopes to double the size of her already buxom bosom. 'I've always had a small waist, big hips and large boobs but I'm kind of a go hard or go home sort of person,' said Penny. 'I wanted to make that significantly more extreme, more dramatic, more stunning and more wonderful.' Shockingly, the corset is so tight that Penny can't eat a proper meal whilst wearing it - as her stomach is so restricted. In the last two years, 25-year-old Penny has had two boob jobs taking her from an H to an O cup . Penny, pictured before she started to wear the corset (left) and today with it on (right), says the pain and discomfort of transforming her body into that of Jessica Rabbits has been worth it . Penny on day one of training her body to wear a corset which she wears up to 23 hours a day and has shrunk her waist from 38 to a tiny 23 inches . Penny admits she is obsessed with big breasts and doesn't think her cup size will ever be big enough . Bending, sitting and lying down can also be a struggle. Driving is very uncomfortable and any form of exercise is totally off-limits. Extreme corseting has even been known to rearrange the internal organs, but Penny, a pin-up model, isn't worried. Instead she says the curves of her idol are worth any discomfort. 'I've been obsessed with Jessica Rabbit from a really early age,' she says. 'I think she is incredibly sexy and there's a real power and strength to her character. Within the first four months of corset training, Penny had lost 15 inches from her waist . Today Penny has a 26inch waist and a 55inch bust and is proud of her figure . Penny says that her new body has given her confidence after years of low self confidence, and she feels like is wearing protective armour when she is in her corset . 'I've always wanted to copy that - at five I was already thinking about breast implants.' Australian . Penny, who now lives on the small island of Okinawa, Japan, embarked on . her quest for the perfect hourglass figure two years ago. She . wore the corset in February 2012 to pose for some saucy snaps for her . husband Cooper, 28, who was deployed overseas with the US Airforce. But . Penny was so fascinated by the effect on her figure that she began . corset training - a method that involves shrinking your waist by wearing . the tight-laced garment for long periods of time. For four months Penny wore the corset non-stop, only taking it off to shower. Penny says it has taken a lot of hard work and dedication and isn't concerned about the effect the corset training may be having on her internal organs . The corset is so tight that sitting down is extremely difficult (left), Penny is unable to eat a full meal with it on and it leaves deep red marks on her skin when removed (right) 'It was tough at first,' she says. 'The corset is not a magical tool that will make your waist tiny in a few months. 'It really was hard work and dedication on my part. 'I stuck to little meals, and also things that incorporate liquid into the food - like smoothies. 'One . thing that was difficult was not being able to eat my favourite spicy . foods - because they would wreak havoc on my stomach when it was . restricted in the corset.' Disturbingly, corset training is known to move around the internal organs, but Penny isn't concerned. She says: 'The stomach is an incredibly resilient thing - it can withstand being squashed. 'At first I wore the corset too much and I experienced some pain and discomfort, but now I know how much my body could handle. Penny, here aged 10 in Australia, says she was obsessed with the cartoon character from an early age . 'I found it difficult to sleep in the corset at first but it doesn't bother me now.' Within the first four months of corset training, Penny had lost 15 inches from her waist. In 2012 she had her first boob job, taking her from an already ample 34H to a 36J. But Penny still thought her breasts were too small. 'I've . always been obsessed with big boobs,' said Penny. 'The bigger they are . the better and I don't think I'll ever be big enough.' A year later Penny went under the knife again to boost her assets a further five cup sizes. Today Penny has a 26inch waist and a 55inch bust and is proud of her figure. She said: 'I love my body and my shape but I'd still like to have more extreme proportions. 'I'd . never consider surgery anywhere but my breasts - but I'll keep having . breast surgery until my boobs are as big as possible.' Although she still wears the corset every day, it is only occasionally that she puts it on for 23 hours at a time. And Penny's new shape has dramatically improved her self-confidence. She explains: 'I've suffered with body image issues and low self-esteem for most of my life. 'But when I wear a corset I feel like I'm in armour or wrapped in a safety blanket.' When out of the house, Penny often finds herself surrounded by admirers who want to have their picture taken with her. Penny's husband also embraces her severe curves. Despite receiving intense criticism from some people and even death threats, Penny says she has no intention of stopping . Penny poses with local Jessica Rabbit fans dressed in her corset on the streets of Okinawa, Japan . He said: 'Penny is as close to Jessica Rabbit as any mere mortal can get. 'Her shape is exciting and interesting. I don't like the ordinary or the generic.' Penny does have her critics, however, and has experienced negativity about her look online. She said: 'Some people don't agree with what I'm doing - they say I'm destroying my body and it doesn't look natural. 'I've even had death threats, but my appearance is for me and I love the way my body looks. 'Jessica Rabbit's figure is sensual, strong and extreme and it's a pleasure to replicate that in real life.'","Penny has been obsessed by Jessica Rabbit since childhood .

"By . Katy Winter . Physically carrying your kids around is one thing, but lugging their combined weight on your own frame in extra pounds is quite another. But  a mother-of-four has lost a whopping ten stone, the weight of her children put together after they spurred her on to beat the bulge. Emily Rennie, 29, from Stafford, was encouraged by her three older children, Leo, 8 Libby, 6 and Taylor, 4, to stick to her diet after tipping the scales at 19st. Dropped from 19st and a size 22 to 9st and size 10 by joining Weight Watchers and with the support of her children . Emily's total weight loss is equivalent to the combined weight of her children (L-R) Taylor, 4, Leo, 8, Joseph, 19 weeks and Libby,6 . The adorable tots would cheer on their mother if she was doing well, and even warn her against eating less nutritious foods. Now Emily has lost an impressive 10st, the same as her four children’s combined weight - despite becoming pregnant with baby Joseph, 19 weeks, during her weight loss - and now weighs in at a svelte nine stone. Emily said: 'As soon as I joined Weight Watchers the kids were behind me every step of the way. 'They’d support me and tell me off if I went to get something unhealthy out of the fridge. 'Every time I had a weigh in they’d always ask me how I’d done and congratulate me. 'Now, when they see old pictures of me they don’t recognise the person as their mummy. Emily gained weight eating takeaways and burgers and snacking on crisps and cake . 'I had my own little team to keep me going. 'I’m just so pleased I’ve been able to do this for them.' Emily began to put on weight at the age of 17 after being diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. 'I was 17 when I was diagnosed with Crohn’s, and the medication made me gain quite a bit of weight quite quickly. 'Then after that I just got fatter and fatter. 'I just ate the wrong foods - I’d have takeaways and burgers and I’d snack on crisps and cake. 'If I ever felt hungry during the day I’d go to the fridge and just cut myself a chunk of cheese - I’d never do that now. 'Then I went onto have three children in the space of five years, and because I was pregnant I used it as an excuse to eat more. 'Before I knew where I was I weighed 19 stone.' But after seeing an unflaterring photo of herself, Emily decided to join Weight Watchers. Emily said: I’d tried other diets before, but this time I was determined . 'I was a size 22 and even then I sometimes had to go up a size. 'When I saw the picture of myself, I just didn’t realise I was that big. 'But I took to Weight Watchers straight away, and actually found it easy. 'I lost the weight really quickly - I had to stop when I had Joseph but as soon as he was born I lost the baby weight and then some.' As soon as Emily began dieting, her loving children were determined to help their mother, becoming her own personal support team. Emily said: 'I explained to the children that mummy was going to start eating more healthily. 'At first there wasn’t much of a reaction but soon they really started to notice what I was doing and they were so positive. The children became Emily's support team, cheering on her successes and discouraging her from eating bad foods . Having lost over six dress sizes, Emily is now swamped by her old trousers (left) while Leo, 8, and Libby, 6 can easily fit one in each leg (right) 'They’d tell me off I was going to give into a craving and eat something naughty, and Libby would always ask me how I was doing. 'I didn’t want to disappoint them so I knew I had to keep going. 'It’s been great for them as they understand the importance of being healthy and to eat good foods.' Now, the children don’t recognise old pictures of their mother. Emily said: 'The other day I was looking through some pictures and I asked Libby who the lady in the picture was. Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Sandwich with crisps and chocolate bar . Dinner: Burger with chips . Snacks: Cheese, crisps and cake . Breakfast: Apple and banana . Lunch: Weight Watchers soup or ham salad sandwich . Dinner: Grilled chicken salad . Snacks: Weight Watchers biscuits . 'She had no idea and was even more shocked when I told her it was me. 'It’s lovely to see how proud they are of me.' Emily has now dropped an impressive six dress sizes to a size 10, and couldn’t be happier. Emily said: 'I wish I’d done this years ago. 'Not only do I weight less, but I feel like a different person. 'I’m so much happier and healthier. 'Before I wasn’t active at all, but now I can run around after the kids all day long. 'I can’t thank them enough for helping me through - I hope I’ve made them proud.'","Emily gained weight eating takeaways and snacking on crisps and cake .

"By . Bianca London . If there's one person who knows how to power dress, it's Carol Vorderman. At 53, the former Countdown presenter has never looked better so it comes as no surprise that isme.com has invited her to front its range for a second year running. The TV presenter, who has worked with the clothing brand since February 2013, is modelling the AW14 collection, which includes sumptuous faux fur, checks, plaids and winter florals. Looking good! Carol Vorderman has been unveiled as the face of Isme's AW14 range (leather jacket, £140, vest top, £5, pink capri pants, £29, clutch bag, £16) Speaking to MailOnline about the new range, Carol said: 'There's plenty of leather, which I love, as well as fabulous Christmas dresses. I absolutely love the longer skirts as I think they're much more elegant.' Sharing her summer style tips, Carol, who says she 'doesn't like to dress up too much' in the hotter climes, said: 'I love high-waisted trousers and shorter summer dresses. I think it's so important to just be comfortable in what you're wearing. 'Don't look at a 6ft 2in skinny model and think ""I want to look like her"" - look to people who are your shape and emulate them.' Isme's latest collection aims to stay . true to the brand's ethos with a range that’s designed to add style to a woman's everyday life, whatever your age or size - something Carol knows all about. Carol has become an unofficial postergirl for mature women and is never afraid to experiment with her style or embrace more daring outfits. Poster girl: Carol has long maintained that fashion isn't about age and believes you should dress however you like (blue blouse, £29, pencil skirt, £20, red peep toe heels, £30) How does she do it? Despite being over fifty, Carol looks younger than ever. Her secret? A few sessions with a personal trainer and a simple beauty regime (pink shift dress, £39, bracelet, £25) 'I lived through the sexist 70s,' she explained. 'I just wear what makes me feel psychologically comfortable, fashion isn't about your age; I'm a strong believer in that. Life isn't over at fifty!' Carol cites her style icons as Nicole Schzeringer, although says she 'couldn't look 1 per cent as good as she does', as well as 'incredible' Christie Brinkley, Victoria Beckham and Sophia Loren, who she describes as a 'goddess'. While she loves to dress up, Carol maintains that she's a 'five-minute make-up' kind of girl and likes to keep her beauty regime simple. High flier: Carol has just qualified as a pilot and is about to embark on a solo round the world trip (jumpsuit, £29) When it comes to fitness, Carol says she is very 'off and on' with her exercise regime because she spends a lot of time travelling. 'I am starting back at the gym but I find it very boring and that's why I need a personal trainer. I have also downloaded some really good apps on my phone and if I'm told what to do, I do it,' she said. As well as modelling for Isme, Carol has just trained to become a pilot and is preparing to fly around the world solo. 'I have also been in discussions for a new TV series but I'm not going to overdo that side of work,' she said. Then and now: Carol, pictured, left, last week and, right, in the 80s, says she lived through sexist eras and now wants to wear whatever she likes .","Carol, 53, models Isme's AW14 range .

"By . Martha Cliff . Huge wigs, lashings of glitter and one very prominent beard, it can only mean one thing: London Pride is back with a vengeance. And this year, the line-up is more dazzling than ever before, with Eurovsion winner Conchita Wurst, Sir Ian McKellen, 75, Sinitta, 50, and, of course, plenty of drag queens, all on the bill. Thanks to Conchita's triumph, the success of Rupaul's Drag Race and the popularity of London Live's reality TV series, Drag Queens of London, the drag scene has enjoyed an upswing in interest in recent months. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Miss Dusty O has worked on the drag scene for 25 years and is one of Soho's most famous queens . Dusty named herself after Dusty Springfield, her childhood idol, which was also the nickname that her school bullies taunted her with . But of all the drag queens to feature in the London Live show, none is as popular The Very Miss Dusty O, who runs Trannyshack at Madame Jojo's in Soho and the host on the main stage of this year's Pride in Trafalgar Square tomorrow. But while she's enjoying her new found popularity and soaring success, Miss Dusty says her career wasn't handed to her on a plate. 'I've been in the business professionally for about 25 years,' she explains. 'It started with me just dressing up for Night Clubs and then I started in the industry by standing on the door of clubs and ripping up tickets.' She is now one of Soho's biggest names, and her reputation has seen her become a mentor to young aspiring drag queens - although Dusty herself says she still can't understand the hype. 'I can't deny that I am [a mentor] but . I'm not very comfortable with that,' she confesses. 'I think it's because I'm highly . visible, London has a very small drag scene - everyone always thinks it's . bigger than it is - and I have been in it a long time so people do look . to me for advice. 'People think I am more high-profile and more . successful than I actually am - and certainly more than what my . bank balance is telling me!' Dusty helps to judge Trannyshack Academy at Madame Jojo's, a drag competition that helps uncover new talent. But not every drag queen is created equal. According to Miss Dusty, drag comes in many forms and reveals that the only way to make it is by putting the effort in. 'I always say have . fun, be who you want to be, learn from your mistakes and dress up up up! If you're a professional, you have to really hone your craft. Dusty (centre) took part in London Live's reality TV show, Drag Queens of London . 'People . always ask me: ""How do I become a great Queen?"" and I always say: ""Do it!"" You . have to just get out there. 'It's no good sitting at home in . front of the mirror drawing an eyebrow on. It's like any other art - you . have to practise it.' Miss Dusty's image has certainly changed over the years, starting with a penchant for the New Romantics and her current incarnation: huge ball gowns and plenty of make-up. Dusty will be hosting the main stage at Pride tomorrow . A big character who is not afraid to ruffle the odd feather, Miss Dusty has had her fair share of showdowns, including one with fellow drag queen Bourgeoisie who claimed Dusty had humiliated her. 'I'm different from other drag queens in the way that I don't adopt a character,' adds Miss Dusty. 'Dusty is me, I spend a lot of my time in drag when I host, so I can't pretend to be someone else. 'The name Dusty came from my nickname as a child, everyone else liked Duran Duran and I liked Dusty Springfield. 'Dusty used to be my name of torture at school but now look where it's got me. All of those bullies are in council houses with five children and I'm not!' Miss Dusty has more than 5,000 followers on Twitter and 750 Facebook fans - with social media, according to the veteran, why the drag scene is becoming more accepted. 'There was a real resurgence in the 90s, and I think we're starting to see one now too,' she adds. 'Social media means it's easy to access, everyone everywhere . knows everyone else's business and videos are getting 100,000 hits on YouTube.' But while the ensembles worn by Dusty and her fellow drag queens might look bizarre to the uninitiated, Dusty says it has been around for longer than you might think. 'There has always been an alternative drag scene,' she explains. 'It is becoming a bit more mainstream with Conchita winning Eurovision but there have always been people pushing boundaries. 'Pride is more relevant now than it ever . has been. It reminds us of  how lucky we actually are especially when . there are people being stoned to death for being gay.' 'There do tend to be fewer people strutting around in feather boas singing: ""I am what I am"", but the recent hype around drag is nothing we haven't seen before, it isn't revolutionary.' Tomorrow, she will take part in Gay Pride  - an annual event that sees thousands of people descend on Trafalgar Square in London. 'Pride is more relevant now than it ever has been,' adds Miss Dusty. 'It reminds us of  how lucky we actually are especially when there are people being stoned to death for being gay. 'When people question why we still need Pride I always say: ""It's one day a year!"" We have heterosexuality shoved in our face everyday and this isn't harming anyone. 'At the end of the day it's a party and it puts a smile on people's faces.'","Miss Dusty O is one of the biggest stars on the London drag scene .

"By . Cindy Tran . and Ryan Lipman . A toddler who was knocked over by his family dogs as he took them for a walk with his parents has died in hospital. Police were called to a home in Oberon, west of Sydney, where Joey Woodcock was found unconscious and not breathing. The three-year-old had suffered head injuries while walking with his mother and stepfather Andrew Woodcock in a park opposite their home at around 1pm on Sunday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A sheet of blotting paper used to dry the Royal signatures on the document confirming the abdication of King Edward VIII has come to light after 78 years. The 'Instrument of Abdication' was signed by the outgoing playboy monarch and his three brothers who were witnesses to the historic moment. They were Albert, who immediately became King George VI, Henry, the Duke of Gloucester, and George, the Duke of Kent. Royal history: A sheet of blotting paper used to dry the Royal signatures on the document confirming the abdication of King Edward VIII has come to light after 78 years . Blot of history: The Instrument of Abdication was signed by Edward along with his three brothers who were witnesses to the historic moment. They were Albert, who became King George VI, Henry, the Duke of Gloucester and George, the Duke of Kent . Seven identical documents were signed by the brothers at Windsor Castle and for each one a layer of pink blotting paper was placed over the top to dry the fountain pen ink. There would have been seven pieces of blotting paper but only one has survived and that was kept by Edward who later gave it to a foreign diplomat as a memento. The pink slip of paper has been looked after and handed down through the anonymous diplomat's family. It has now emerged for sale at auction at Sothebys with a pre-sale estimate of £5,000. The four signatures absorbed by the thick sheet are back-to-front from where it mirrored the original document. The auctioneers have used Photoshop software to create an image showing the pink paper flipped and the signatures the right way round, although this is only for demonstration purposes. Scandal: King Edward VIII, pictured here, caused controversy when he gave up his titel to marry Wallis Simpson . King Edward VIII caused a huge constitutional crisis in 1936 when he decided to give up the throne in order to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson. His brother Albert, who was next in line, succeeded him and chose the regal name King George VI. Dr Gabriel Heaton, of auctioneers Sothebys, said: 'This blotting paper is a relic of one of the most important moments in Royal history. 'It is from the time when Edward VIII sat down at a desk in the drawing room of Windsor Castle with his brothers to sign the Instrument of Abdication. 'It was the first time in modern history a monarch had abdicated and there weren't any procedures for it to go by. 'I imagine lawyers and consitutional experts recommended that all four brothers signed the document. 'The blotting paper was quite thick because it was absorbent. It would have been placed over the signed document to dry the ink and make sure it didn't smudge.' In his memoirs, called A King's Story that was published in 1951, Edward wrote: 'By breakfast the next morning the official copies of the Instrument of Abdication, locked up in my familiar red despatch box, were already on my desk. 'My three brothers arrived...we assembled immediately in the octagonal drawing room. 'Sitting at the desk with my three brothers watching, I began to sign the documents. It was all quite informal. The room was filled with a dignified dull murmur. 'When I had signed the last document I yielded the chair to my brothers who in turn appended their signatures as witnesses in their order of precedence.' Dr Heaton said the seven copies of the Instrument of Abdication are held in the National Archives but this is the only sheet of blotting paper known to exist. He said: 'Edward kept the blotting paper as a memento and shortly afterwards gave it to a friend and it has been in their family ever since. 'It is in excellent condition. It has never been exhibited before. It is such a unique item that it is very difficult to value.'The auction takes place in London on July 15 .","Instrument of Abdication signed by King Edward, Albert, Henry and George .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . This stunning floral display bursting with colour and delicate blooms looks like a prize-winning creation from the Chelsea Flower Show -- but glance at the roots and you’ll notice there’s something missing. Rather than growing out of a plant pot, this floral arrangement is emerging from the pages of a book and is in fact a work of the most intricate origami. This incredible sculpture and others by artist Su Blackwell are made entirely from the pages of second-hand books and inspired from the illustrations within. Sertum Orchidaceum, which took three months to create, was inspired by a 1840s book of the same name . The London-based artist trawls second-hand bookshops, car-boot sales and markets for titles that inspire her. This piece, named Sertum Orchidaceum after the book its been intricately fashioned from, is part of the artist's latest series called Wild Flowers Of Britain, which she embarked on after stumbling across antique books on flora in a vintage bookshop in Charing Cross. ‘The book’s covers were dusty and they looked like they hadn't been opened for years, yet they were full of beautiful illustrations,’ the artist tells MailOnline. ‘I wanted the flower illustrations to be the first thing you saw, before having to open the book to see them.' A paper sculpture from the Wild Flowers Of Britain series, which brings the book's original illustrations to life . In detail: Su Blackwell's jaw-dropping sculptures are a work of the most intricate origami . ‘Books are very intimate, and they have a relationship with their reader. I was interested in removing the illustrations and text from the book and offering them out to a wider audience,' she says. This work of efflorescent art, along with another two book sculptures by the artist, are currently on show at London’s Long And Ryle gallery in Beyond The Book, an exhibition showcasing artists who use books as their medium. Su started developing this technique in 2003 following a visit to South East Asia in 2001. ‘I encountered paper-art used in spiritual ceremonies, and came across techniques like origami and paper-cutting,' she says. The content of the book seems to grow from the pages in Su Blackwell's Nature In Britain . ‘When I returned to UK, I began exploring working with paper, which led me to work with books. The first book-sculpture I made was using a second hand book I bought in Thailand,' she recalls. The artist, who originally studied embroidery at the Royal College of Art in London, has always had a penchant for quirky medium. ‘I’ve always been interested in deconstructing non-art objects and then transforming them into works of art, while making them defunct of their original use. Ten years later, Su has created more than 100 different book sculptures, which cost from £5,000. Migrating Words: One of Su Blackwell's enchanting scultpures . Migrating Words up-close: The artist uses hidden wire to create the structure in her sculptures . ‘When I began making them they were very two-dimensional. I have been developing my techniques, and they have become more sculptural, and some include lights and motors to add movement,' she says. ‘It is a tediously slow process, working on a miniature-scale, each sculpture takes around one month to complete.’ Sertum Orchidaceum, which is created from illustrations cut from a copy from 1840 and was commissioned by Sotheby's for an exhibition at Chatsworth House, is one of the largest of Su’s pieces to date and took approximately three months to complete. Tales from Arabian Nights: The mosque commissioned by Fairmont Hotel Group took Su two months to create . Another of her most challenging  projects was the mosque she created for the Fairmont Hotel Group in Abu Dhabi, which took two months of work. So what’s the process of turning a piece of literature into a work of art? ‘Firstly I source the book and read it, often more than once. I sometimes draw a sketch of the overall sculpture, and then I draw templates to cut out. 'I cut through the pages of the book one at a time with a scalpel, and use glue to help strengthen the paper.' Treasure Island fashioned from a copy of the famous novel . Careful not to give away the secrets behind her feats of artistic engineering, Su adds, ‘I use a very fine wire to suspend paper-cut elements, such as snowflakes and stars.' So which one’s her favourite? ‘I get emotionally involved with every single piece, so it’s hard to pick. But I think some of the most successful of my works are from the stories that I have had most enjoyed reading, and have lost myself in, like The Baron In The Trees, The Shell Seekers, and Alice: A Mad Tea Party.’ Which of these enchanting creations captures your imagination? Alice: A Mad Tea Party is one of Su's favourite sculptures . The Book Shop is currently on exhibit at Beyond The Book, at the Long And Ryle gallery in Westminster . Snow White in the Woods features birds suspended from the trees . In The Wild Swans the artist has installed tiny lights to add drama to the piece . Su has made over 100 book sculptures in the past ten years . The Raven, fashioned from a vintage book of the same title, has a spooky feel . The artist uses a technique using fine wire to suspend elements in her creations . The Baron In The Trees is one of the artist's favourite creations from her works of art .

"By . Katy Winter . 'You run like a girl' or 'you throw like a girl' are common insults we’ve all heard or said at one point. Now, in a moving and illuminating video, Always questioned a group of adults on what it means to run, fight and throw ‘like a girl’. The resulting squealing, coquettish giggling and substandard attempts at the task are very much in line with what the phrase has come to mean in society. Scroll down for video . At 14, Erin already believes the phrase 'run like a girl' means to flap your arms and legs and run poorly . One woman squeals and frets about her hair (left) while another - herself a professional runner - giggles and waves her arms (right) when asked to 'run like a girl' by documentary filmmaker Lauren Greenfield . A male participant fights 'like a girl' by ineffectually waving his hands in front of him and panting 'no, stop' However, the poignant moment comes when the same questions are posed to younger girls. Rather than flapping their arms and making pathetic noises, those aged five to 13 instead launch into wholehearted, strong runs, punches and fearless karate kicks. As part of the campaign, Always partnered with award-winning documentary filmmaker Lauren Greenfield to conduct the social experiment into how people interpret the phrase 'like a girl'. At some point during puberty what 'throw like a girl' changes from a simple statement (L) to an insult (R) It is only the older girls who fulfilled the negative stereotype – a 20-year-old marathoner flailed her legs and mockingly expressed angst about her hair when asked to 'run like a girl'; a 19-year-old with toned arms flapped her hands to demonstrate 'fight like a girl'; and a 14-year-old volleyball player lamely flung her arm when asked to 'throw like a girl'. When five-13-year-old girls are asked to 'run like a girl', their response is different to older women's . Girls aged five to 13 illustrate the phrase with strong kicks and punches . A new . survey found the start of puberty and their first period mark the lowest . moments in confidence for girls, and harmful words can add to that drop. When challenged on their reaction to the phrase having seen how young girls responded, the older women seemed shocked. Erin says: ‘I think being insulted with ""like a girl"" definitely drops girls' self-confidence and really puts them down. When challenged on their reaction and given the chance to re-do their actions, the women felt empowered enough to be themselves . ‘During that time, they’re already trying to figure themselves out, and when somebody says ""you hit like a girl"" it’s like, well, what does that mean? 'They think they are a strong person, but it’s kind of telling them they’re weak and not as good as them.’ Another girl simply points out: 'Why can’t ""run like a girl"" still mean ""win the race""?’ Greenfield, who can be heard throughout the film gently challenging the girls on their prejudices, says: ‘In my work as a documentarian, I have witnessed the confidence crisis among girls and the negative impact of stereotypes first-hand. ‘When the words ""like a girl"" are used to mean something bad, it is profoundly disempowering. ‘I am excited to be a part of the movement to redefine ""like a girl"" into a positive affirmation.’","Always video explores what 'like a girl' means to women of all ages .

"By . Ruth Styles . Whether it's stress or having a blazing row with your partner, the triggers that lead to comfort eating are myriad - and can cause you to pile on the pounds. Now a psychologist and diet expert claims to have uncovered the 'emotional triggers' that lead to comfort eating and what you can do to avoid them. Dr Jane McCartney says identifying the stresses that send you into a frenzy of comfort eating need to be identified before you can lose weight but adds that once you do, shifting excess pounds becomes easy. Comfort food: Emotional triggers such as rows can lead to comfort eating - and piling on the pounds . Weighty problem: Dr Jane McCarthy says emotional eating is one of the chief causes of weight gain . 'First you need to identify that you're overeating whether that's with crisps, doughnuts, cake or whatever,' she explains in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'It could be something in the here and now - for instance, you might not be getting on with a colleague or you might have financial issues  - or it could be something more long term such as having a feud with your neighbour or falling out with your parents.' Whether it's a bad neighbour or a row with your other half, according to Dr McCartney, it's essential that you recognise when you're comfort eating rather than tucking in because you're genuinely hungry. 'You need to ask yourself: ""Am I eating because I'm hungry?"",' says Dr McCartney. 'If you're not, then you need to find some motivation to do something about it. But if you genuinely are hungry then eat.' Britain's burgeoning obesity crisis - the most recent figures show that 70 per cent of British people are overweight or obese - has been blamed on everything from sedentary lifestyles to sugary snacks. But that's not the whole story, says Dr McCartney, who says that emotional reasons contribute a significant amount to Britain's bulging waistline. 'People are overweight for emotional reasons,' reveals Dr McCartney. 'It's a huge problem and it's not always recognised. 'People understand comfort eating like indulging in a bar of chocolate to get away from what's going on in your life at that moment. It's a vicious cycle, and you need to get out of it.' So what do you do when oscillating emotions send you reaching for the biscuits? Dr McCartney's solution is what she describes as a '10-minute self-intervention'. Flashpoints: Living with an unpleasant neighbour or rows with a partner are both common triggers . Solution: Dr McCartney suggests giving yourself 10 minutes to reconsider before eating . 'If . you're in a coffee shop and you fancy a chocolate biscuit, wait 10 minutes before coming back to it to see if you still want it,' she suggests. 'Nine times out . of 10 you won't. If you ride the wave of anxiety, you will feel so much . better for not eating.' But it's not just about identifying your trigger points and stopping. Dr McCartney, who is behind new book Stop Overeating: The 28-Day Plan to End Emotional Eating for Good, says combining willpower with healthy eating is essential if you want to shift the pounds. 'I'm not saying that we shouldn't have . nice to things like crisps and chocolate to eat but everything in . moderation,' she adds. 'These things are probably not the sort of thing you . should eat on a diet but I do think it's a good idea to make an agreement with . yourself when you start the diet that you can always come back to these . foods when you come off the diet and it's not forever.' Regardless of what you put in your mouth, key to losing weight is breaking the link between emotions and food, and slowing yourself down at mealtimes. 'If you eat . slowly you are conscious of what you're eating,' explains Dr McCartney. 'It can actually take . 10 to 20 minutes for your brain to give the signal that you're full, which means little tricks such as keeping a glass of water next to your . plate can really help. 'Another . exercise I get people to do is to acknowledge the length of time . between having something in their mouths. 'We are constantly grazing . nowadays and we barely go 20 minutes without something going in our . mouth and it’s not always the good stuff.' And to deal with the temptation to use food as a reward for completing a task? 'It . is great to reward yourself but just not necessarily with food,' explains the psychologist. ;I . always recommend buying something else like a plant or a brooch, and it . doesn't have to be expensive. 'I knew a woman who would take herself down . to a charity shop and pick up a brooch for 20p and it would be so much . better because it represents her and it's much longer lasting.' Stop Overeating: The 28-Day Plan to End Emotional Eating for Good by Dr Jane McCartney, £10.99, is published by Vermillion . Once you've worked out what your emotional triggers are, the next step is to start slimming down with a healthy diet. Although snacking isn't banned, Dr McCartney says making sure it's healthy is key. 'There is nothing wrong with a TV snack so long as it is a healthy one – one being the optimum word there,' she writes, . 'One really good tip is to make the snack take as long as possible to eat, celery with a cottage cheese dip for example or half a dozen nuts in their shells. 'This is not just about the calories, it is about the time taken to eat. To satisfy your established grazing habits you almost have to trick yourself into believing that you are eating all the time, until you get into the habit of not doing so.' Here's what to eat for the first few days: . DAY ONE: . Breakfast: Porridge (made with 40 g / ½ oz oats and water) with cinnamon and a handful of raisins . Lunch: One crusty roll with one poached egg and one grilled sliced tomato . Dinner: Tagliolini with almond pesto followed by spiced orange sorbet . DAY TWO: . Breakfast: One toasted plain bagel filled with one tablespoon of soft cheese . Lunch: Carrot and coriander soup with homemade croutons . Dinner: Mushroom and thyme risotto followed by one-quarter of a small shop-bought flan casefilled with fruit, served with one tablespoon of single cream . DAY THREE: . Breakfast: Two slices of medium wholemeal bread filled with one grilled vegetarian sausage, sliced into four strips, one grilled sliced tomato . Lunch: One jacket potato (no butter) with two tablespoon of tuna (canned in water or brine, drained) and chopped cucumber . Dinner: Fish and rustic chunky chips followed by bought meringue nest, one tablespoon fromagefraîs with grated dark chocolate topping .","Dr Jane McCartney says emotional eating is a major cause of weight gain .

"By . Scarlett Russell . Singapore was fifty shades of blush this weekend, when thousands of people gathered for the Pink Dot parade in Hong Lim Park to celebrate being gay. An unprecedented number of partygoers of all ages came out to support the event; part of global Gay Pride month in June, which celebrates liberation of all sexual orientation. Around 26,000 revellers filled the park - the only place where public assemblies can take place without a permit.

Despite the mass gathering Singapore still has laws in place concerning homosexuality. Section 377 of the Penal Code, which essentially criminalises homosexual acts and is still found in many areas of the Far East. In Singapore, however, the ban on gay sex is not actively enforced – the government say that the law only keeps the law in place to reflect the stance of ‘mainstream society,’ according to the Huffington Post. Because of the largely conservative views of the country, the Pink Dot parade is often faced with criticism, though this year it was all the more severe as the rally fell on the eve of Ramadan, prompting one Muslim teacher to start a Wear White campaign against homosexuality.

"By . Martha Cliff . 17-year-old Lucy will take on her 37-year-old trainer Paul Ashe later this month . When Lucy Garland first told her parents she wanted try out wrestling, they didn't think she was serious. But now the petite blonde, at only 5ft 5ins tall, takes on men in the ring who are more than twice her age and size. The 17-year-old started training at the Ultimate British Wrestling (UBW) club in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, just one year ago but has already progressed to a competitive level. Lucy, who has gained a reputation for her high-energy moves, will take on her 37-year-old trainer, Paul Ashe, in the ring during her first live match later this month (July 19). With her long blonde curly hair, small frame and studying production art and costume design at Btec level, Lucy is not your typical wrestler. She says that people are always shocked to hear about her double life in the fighting ring. 'People are always quite surprised when I tell them I'm a wrestler,' she says. 'My parents didn't think I would stick at it as I was the only girl at the club, but now they are very supportive and really proud.' Although Lucy has only been training for a year, her interest spans back over eight years, when she first became engrossed in the subject after watching a wrestling match on TV at the age of nine. 'I was flicking through the TV channels and came across World Wrestling Entertainment and really enjoyed it,' Lucy says. However, she had to wait until the age of 16 before she could join the club - and found it to be an intimating experience. 'It was . scary at first as it is seen as a man's sport and I was the only female . at the club,' she says. 'But I soon got . to know everyone and absolutely loved it. Wrestling has given me so much . more confidence, I don't know what I would have been like if I hadn't . done it.' Lucy first showed an interest in wrestling at the age of nine but had to wait till she was 16 to start training with Paul Ashe (pictured) Lucy says she is devoted to her craft, and trains once a week, working out at the gym six days a week and sticking to a strict diet in order to keep up with professional standards. 'I need to keep fit and also look physically good in the ring. Wrestling is as much about putting on a show as fighting,' she adds. Lucy wants to take a gap year after college and go travelling, but before that she has to tackle her fight with her trainer Paul this month. Double life: Lucy, who studies a Btec in Art Production and Costume Design says that people are always shocked to hear about her wrestling hobby . 'I'm nervous as it's my first match, but I hope I will win. A year ago I would never have expected to be able to fight against Paul,' she says. Lucy, whose mum Pauline is a teaching assistant and dad Richard is a postman, is the only wrestler in her family, says that being small has its advantages in the sport. 'Wrestling can be scary and I think you need dedication and a passion for it if you are going to succeed. I absolutely love it.' 'As I'm smaller than a lot of my opponents I tend to rely on my speed,' she said. 'Wrestling can be scary and I think you need dedication and a passion for it if you are going to succeed. I absolutely love it.' Justin Feller, a manager at UBW, said that the club are really pleased with Lucy's efforts. 'The management team at UBW are thrilled with the progress and dedication demonstrated by Lucy since she started training with us in 2013. 'We expect big things from her in the future and her age definitely gives her a great head start.' Lucy will be battling against trainer Paul at North Hertfordshire College's Hitchin Centre for Arts on July 19.","Lucy Garland has been training in wrestling for just one year .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . For many women, it's the tell-tale signs of aging around their eyes and their mouth they wish they could banish. However, for Christine Hockney, 58, from Southampton, it was wrinkle-free ears she longed for. The mother-of-one said damage caused by wearing large earrings when she was younger had left her with older-looking ears. BEFORE: The wrinkly ear, which affected Christine's self-esteem . AFTER: Her lobe back to its former puffy self after being injected with filler . And she was delighted when she found the answer to her problem – eartox. The . treatment, officially known as ‘ear rejuvenation’, eliminates lines from . the earlobes and restores them to their youthful puffy selves. Christine says: ‘I felt that my earlobes were old, and I felt very self-conscious about it. ‘My ears had lost volume due to the natural aging process and I also had a really strong wrinkle line running vertically down my lobe to the point where my ears had been pierced. ‘It was always visible no matter what type of earrings I wore and I could only wear small, light studs, as anything heavier would look like it was dropping out my ear. Christine, 58, after her ear treatment . ‘It not . only meant I could no longer wear the earrings I loved, it also affected . the way I could wear my hair and my confidence.’ It was Dr Carolyn Berry, a Southampton-based cosmetic doctor, who offered Christine the treatment. ‘The lobe is injected with filler in several areas and inflates, but it then looks better immediately,’ Dr Berry explains. The hydrophilic filler draws fluid into it, which causes further inflation and makes the tissue appear softer and more hydrated. 'Eartox' may seem an odd route to beauty, but Christine says: 'We all have our thing.' And she couldn’t be happier with her new voluminous lobes. ‘The procedure was painless and very comfortable, there were no after-effects, no pain or swelling,' she says. ‘I’m not sure anyone else will notice I’ve had it had done, but it affected my self-esteem and I now feel like my whole face is the same age. ‘I can also wear my hair up and feel confident that I have younger looking, rejuvenated earlobes. And I can wear fabulous earrings again. ‘I’ve always loved accessorising outfits. I even used to buy the earrings first and then find an outfit to match. ‘In the Eighties and Nineties I wore the massive, heavy earring, which were fashionable at the time.

"By . Sam Webb . Mother-of-three Lucy Mbugua of Selly Park, Birmingham, lied on a social security form by claiming she had the right to live in Britain. She claimed £26,000 over nearly four years . A fraudster who stole more than £26,000 in benefits after being ordered to quit the UK has been spared prison. Mother-of-three Lucy Mbugua of Selly Park, Birmingham, lied on a social security form by claiming she had the right to live in Britain. In fact, the 40-year-old’s bid to stay in the UK had already been rejected three years before she filled in the document in September 2009. Mbugua, from Kenya, had been convicted of three offences of dishonestly claiming taxpayers’ cash while having no right to remain in the country. She picked up a total of £26,356 over a period of almost four years. Mbugua was handed a nine-month suspended sentence at Birmingham Crown Court. Judge Elizabeth Fisher told her: 'I could send you to prison but I don’t intend to do so. 'You are a lady of hitherto good character and have shown a capability to work hard and undertake your family responsibilities.' The court heard Mbugua entered the country legally from Kenya in 2003. But she lost the right to work when her application to remain after 2006 was turned down. She was forced to quit her job as a housekeeper, prompting her bid for benefits, when a former employer asked to see her passport. Simon Mortimore, prosecuting, said she ticked a box confirming she was entitled to live in the UK when she made her claim on September 17, 2009. He said: 'She admitted she knew she would not have received benefits if she ticked ""no"". 'She says she never intentionally lied.' Mbugua was handed a nine-month suspended sentence at Birmingham Crown Court by Judge Elizabeth Fisher . Mr Mortimore said Mbugua now had the right to remain in the UK until 2016 pending her latest appeal to stay in the country. Theresa Hunt, defending, said Mbugua had been shunned by her community after her fraudulent claims were revealed. She told the court: 'She found herself in a difficult position. She lost her job and was unable to care for the basic needs of her daughters. 'So she chose to tick the box on the form . saying she had a permanent right to remain. She only had the right to . stay as long as her appeal was with the Home Office.' Judge Elizabeth Fisher, pictured in 1992, was once labelled Britain's softest after 10 of the sentences she dished out to criminals were increased on appeal . Birmingham Crown Court heard Mbugua entered the country legally from Kenya in 2003 . Miss Hunt said Mbugua was now training to be a carer and wanted to repay the cash she claimed. Judge Fisher was once labelled Britain’s softest after 10 of the sentences she dished out to criminals were increased on appeal. In 2009 the Birmingham Mail reported that she had the most decisions overruled for excessive leniency between 2003 and 2008. The attorney-general’s office released the list and most of the judges on it had only one case referred - Judge Fisher had seven. In five of them, involving a total of 10 defendants, the sentences were increased. In one case involving a sexual assault, her sentence was described by senior judges as 'wholly inadequate'.","Lucy Mbugua from Kenya was handed a nine-month suspended sentence .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A couple who struggled to have a baby were stunned when doctors said their laptop was to blame. Scott Reed was told having the appliance on his lap had caused heat damage to his sperm. And, as a result, the 30-year-old electrician and his wife, Laura, also 30, were finding it harder to conceive. Mr Reed started using his laptop on a table instead and three months later Mrs Reed became pregnant with baby daughter Taryn. Scott and his wife Laura were delighted when they have baby Taryn after discovering a hot laptop could be stopping them from conceiving . Mrs Reed said: 'I've never heard of this happening before, when the doctors told us it was a real shock. 'Scott would use his laptop in the evenings for a couple of hours on and off while we were watching television. 'He would use it for work and general things like Facebook. We had absolutely no idea the damage it was causing him.' The couple, from Clanfield in Hampshire, visited their GP after trying for a baby for six months without success. Initially it was thought Mr Reed's fertility had been affected by mumps - which he had suffered with at the age of 21. Mrs Reed, a pathologist, said: 'About six months after we started trying I was getting frustrated and mentioned it to my doctor. 'You don't think it will be that hard to get pregnant. We both went back to have a chat and the doctor put Scott forward for a fertility test.' Taryn Reed, 11 months . In October 2010 the couple were referred to the andrology department of the pathology unit at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. Mr Reed said: 'Because I had the mumps I needed to get tested. We were concerned they would find something but then we wanted a baby so we had to find out. 'I didn't think about the worst-case scenario and just had to get on with it.' Tests revealed Mr Reed was producing a healthy amount of sperm but they had suffered heat damage. Under . the microscope it was possible to see that the tail of the sperm had . coiled around the head, meaning it couldn't swim quickly to the egg. The problem is common in chefs - who work in hot environments - but can also be caused by laptop computers. Mr . Reed said: 'I never thought using a laptop would affect the quality of . my sperm. After asking if I was a chef, the next thing was 'do you use a . laptop?' 'I was using it daily and hadn't given it a second thought. It was quite shocking really.' After that Mr Reed made sure he placed his laptop either beside him or on a table. Mrs Reed said: 'We carried on trying and we weren't having any luck. We thought it wasn't going to happen so we started planning a trip to travel around Thailand. But then I did a test and found out I was expecting.' Taryn, now 10 months, was born on December 8 last year. Proud parent Mr Reed is now encouraging more men to be aware of the dangers of laptops - and not to be shy if they think there might be a problem with fertility. He said: 'Generally men clam up and don't want to talk about anything to do with genitals. Don't be scared of going through the process. I wanted children and so I got tested.' Scott had been using his computer on his lap for a few hours each evening. Doctors said it caused his sperm to coil up, making it difficult for them to swim . Biomedical andrologist Sue Kenworthy, from Queen Alexandra Hospital, confirmed the heat of the laptop can have an effect on sperm. She said: 'Scott had been producing a healthy amount of sperm but looking under a microscope I saw that there was heat damage. 'Scott was using his laptop every day and for a few hours. It would get really hot, which would have an effect on his sperm. 'This showed up under the microscope. The tail of the sperm had coiled around the head. 'This means it can't swim quickly and get to the egg. I would say men should place the laptop on a table, rather than on their lap, as this can make a difference.'","Couple, both 30, visited doctors after trying to conceive for six months .

"By . Steve Hopkins . Two vulnerable single mothers were exploited by a cruel conman who pretended that he was terminally ill and had served in Afghanistan as a marine. David Andrews has been jailed for 20 months for taking advantage of Heather Neal and Melanie Poynter before stealing from their children and selling their possessions on. Norwich Crown Court heard how the fraudster won the sympathy of the two women by spinning a series of yarns about his past at a time when they were particularly defenceless. Victims: Melanie Poynter, left, and Heather Neal, right, were exploited by conman and thief David Andrews . Andrews, 32, became . involved with Miss Neal, 37, of Spixworth, Norfolk, in . June 2012, telling her that he was suffering from cancer. He . persuaded her to take him for treatment at the Norfolk and Norwich . University Hospital - even though there was nothing wrong with him. While she waited in her car for him outside the hospital he would simply wander around the corridors to waste time and make her think he was seeing a doctor, the court heard. He later stole an iPad belonging to her daughter and sold it. Fraud: David Andrews told 'lie after lie' to 'weedle his way' into the single mother's lives . Andrews then targeted Miss Poynter, 33, of Cromer, Norfolk, and started a relationship with her. He . told her that he was a former Royal Marine who had shot children in . Afghanistan and was therefore suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Andrews stole and sold an iPod, DS Lite and Xbox Connect belonging to Miss Poynter's daughter, while she was in hospital receiving treatment for a serious kidney condition. The iPad contained the only pictures and video Miss Poynter had of her daughter taking part in the Olympic Torch relay in 2012. Andrews, from Walcott in Norfolk, admitted two counts of theft and fraud by false representation. Judge . Stephen Holt said Andrews had told 'lie after lie' and had managed to . 'wheedle his way' into the lives of the women who were struggling to . bring up their children. He . said: 'The lies you told were quite incredible. The bigger the lie, the . more likely people are to believe it. In my view what you did was . utterly despicable. 'This is one of the worst types of case, on its facts, of this particular offence that I've come across.' Prosecutor Chris Youell said: 'Essentially he was living a lie, creating a back story to ingratiate himself to these women.' Both victims read out victim statements in court, despite being reduced to tears by the crime. Miss . Neal said Andrews' lies were 'constant' and told how her daughter was . 'really upset' by the theft - thinking at first that a stranger had burgled their . house. She added that she now finds it 'very hard' to trust men. Devastated: Miss Poynter and Miss Neal said that Andrews' crime had damaged their ability to trust others . Deceit: Andrews claimed to have been a Royal Marine, like the men seen here on a training exercise . Richard Wood, who defended Andrews, admitted that the offences were of a 'very unpleasant character' and 'wholly unacceptable'. He said Andrews might need 'professional help'. After the hearing, Miss Poynter described Andrews as 'evil'. Sergeant . Kevin White of Norfolk Police said Andrews followed the same pattern in . manipulating both women and may have done it to others. He urged anyone else affected by Andrews to contact police.","Heather Neal and Melanie Poynter were both exploited by David Andrews .

"By . Darren Boyle . Linda Greenacre, pictured, received an 18-month jail sentence after admitting stealing £33,000 from a 90-year-old widow she was caring for . A carer stole £33,300 life savings from a frail 90-year-old widow she was supposed to be looking after - and blew most of it on 'rubbish jewellery' advertised on a TV channel. Linda Greenacre, 55, from Kings Lynn paid 64 cheques totalling £26,300 into her account from the victim's after forging her signature. She also made 36 cash withdrawals to the value of £7,000 from her victim's bank card over the period of two years. Norwich Crown Court heard that Greenacre used £20,276 to buy 477 items of jewellery from a television shopping channel. Officers who raided Greenacre's house recovered some of the purchased jewellery which was worth only £200. Greenacre was jailed for 18 months yesterday after admitting theft. The court heard that Greeacre stole the money as she always had to 'scrimp and save and wanted some nice things for herself'. Greenacre, of King's Lynn, stole the money between March 10, 2012 and January 1 this year. Kevin . Eastwick, prosecuting, said Greenacre was caught when her victim, who . relies on carers to help her every day, got a letter from her bank . warning her account was overdrawn. Mr Eastwick said the vulnerable pensioner had impaired speech and hearing and could not leave her home by herself. As . her carer, Greenacre had access to her bank card and cheque book and . would take her to the bank once a month to cash a cheque for . necessities. The victim never used a cashpoint as she was too 'scared', the court heard. Police seized a lot of jewellery when they searched Greenacre's home but it was only worth about £200. Judge Katherine Moore, sitting at Norwich Crown Court, pictured, told Greenacre that her 'particularly mean spell of offending' meant she had to go straight to prison . Neil . Guest, defending, said: 'Although she committed the most mean of . offences possible she's not a clever defendant and it was . unsophisticated in its execution. 'She's remorseful. 'I cannot answer why she wasted the money she took on this rubbish jewellery. 'We asked for a psychiatric report as there is clearly something behind what why she did it, but don't know what.' Judge Katharine Moore told Greenacre that her 'particularly mean spell of offending' meant that she had to go straight to jail. The victim was too unwell to attend court. The devastated victim, who lives on her own in a council flat in King's Lynn, Norfolk, said last night: 'She did wrong. Maybe this will teach her a lesson.' But her niece and nephew, Anita and Raymond Elmore, who are her only relatives, travelled to Norwich from their home in St Neots, Cambs, to witness the sentencing hearing. Mrs Elmore said afterwards: 'Eighteen months is not enough for the amount of money she took. 'We're just devastated by what happened. 'My aunt is such a kind and caring person. 'She and my uncle, who died about four years ago, had deliberately saved for their old age - and then this woman takes their money.' Det Con Bridget Milne, of Norfolk Police adult abuse investigation unit, said last night: ""'This theft took place over a prolonged period and saw Linda Greenacre take advantage of an elderly lady whom she was trusted to care for. 'Her actions were calculated, deceitful and purely for her own personal gain.' She added: 'The majority of the money stolen was spent on jewellery. 'Over and above the financial impact of her crime is the emotional distress caused to this vulnerable and trusting elderly lady who had known Greenacre for over six years.'","Linda Greenacre spent £26,300 on jewellery from a TV shopping channel .

"By . Ap  Reporter . A Milwaukee man who killed his 13-year-old neighbor last year testified Thursday the shooting was 'justice' because he thought the teen had broken into his home and stolen weapons. John Henry Spooner, 76, said the suspicion that Darius Simmons stole expensive shotguns of deep sentimental value left him 'very, very angry.' Police searched Darius' home after the shooting and didn't find the weapons. A prosecutor alleged that Spooner traded the boy's life for guns in a desire for revenge. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Despicable: John Spooner , pictured last week, murdered a 13-year-old African-American boy and says he would have shot his brother too. Spooner was sentenced today to life in prison . 'I wouldn't call it revenge. I would call it justice,' Spooner said defiantly, drawing audible gasps from the courtroom. Darius' mother, Patricia Larry, threw up her hands and muttered, 'Oh my god.' Spooner was testifying against the . advice of his lawyer. Defense attorney Franklyn Gimbel told the judge . during morning proceedings that his client had suddenly lost the mental . competence to continue with the trial. The judge halted proceedings for a . few hours until a court-appointed psychiatrist performed a brief . examination and pronounced Spooner competent to continue. Tragedy: Darius Simmons was gunned down after his elderly neighbor wrongfully accused him of stealing several guns from his home . Spooner was convicted Wednesday of first-degree intentional homicide. That verdict advanced the trial to a second phase to determine whether Spooner was sane at the time of the May 2012 shooting. The second phase wrapped up Friday with testimony from a doctor hired by the prosecution. A doctor retained by the defense testified Wednesday that Spooner had anger issues that caused him to periodically detach from reality. Ultimately, the jury ruled that Spooner is competent and he now faces a sentence of life in prison. Spooner didn't testify in the first . phase. The judge asked him Thursday if he wanted to testify in the . second phase, and Spooner said he'd prefer to give a 15-minute . statement. When told he could only address the jury in the form of sworn . testimony and cross-examination, he agreed to take the stand. Spooner . mostly spoke in a calm voice but sounded anguished as he recounted how . he confronted Darius and shot him in the chest. He recalled that someone . had stolen four shotguns from his home two days earlier, and he was . frustrated by a limited police response. Gimbel asked him what caused him to shoot the boy. 'I . wanted my guns back,' Spooner replied, squeezing his eyes shut and . resting his head against his fingertips. 'I just wanted them back so . bad.' Spooner . never denied shooting Darius, and acknowledged wanting to kill the . teen's older brother as well. Theodore Larry, 18, had rushed into the . street to help his wounded brother. Grieving: Patricia Larry, Darius Simmons' mother, watched as Spooner killer her son . 'If there weren't other people behind him you would have shot him,' prosecutor Mark Williams offered. 'I would have shot him,' Spooner replied. The . strongest piece of evidence against Spooner was footage from his own . surveillance cameras, which showed him confronting Darius on the . sidewalk and pointing a handgun at him. The boy backpedaled a few steps . with his hands up. Spooner then exchanged words with Darius' mother on . her porch off screen, and then turned and fired one shot at Darius' chest. The teen fled, and Spooner fired a second shot that missed. He tried to shoot a third time but the gun jammed. Darius died a few moments later across the street, in his mother's arms. Gimbel . conceded from the outset that Spooner killed the boy, but argued during . the first phase that the homicide may have been reckless but not . intentional, because Spooner didn't mean for the shot to be fatal. The . jury deliberated for about an hour Wednesday before rejecting that . argument. Support: Patricia Larry hugs family friend Keith Bailey at the trial of the man who murdered her son . Life: Spooner faces life in prison now that a jury has found him competent . Spooner had entered two pleas to the homicide charge: not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. That set up the trial to be conducted in two phases: the first to determine whether he was guilty of the homicide, and if so, a second to determine whether he was mentally competent at the time. While Spooner didn't deny what he did, he had a hard time explaining to the prosecutor why he did it. When Williams asked if he took the safety off the gun because he wanted to kill the boy, Spooner said he didn't know. Williams asked why Spooner fired a second time and Spooner again said he didn't know. Finally, Williams asked whether Spooner felt bad about taking Darius' life. 'Not that bad,' he replied softly.","John Spooner says he feels 'not that bad' about killing his 13-year-old neighbor .

"By . Associated Press . A 76-year-old man who fatally shot his unarmed teenage neighbor was sentenced to life in prison on Monday, days after telling the court he killed the boy for justice because he believed he stole his shotguns. John Henry Spooner's home had been burglarized two days before the May 2012 shooting, and he suspected 13-year-old Darius Simmons as the thief. So he confronted the teen, demanded that he return the guns and then shot him in the chest in front of his mother when he denied stealing anything. Spooner's own home surveillance cameras captured the shooting in Milwaukee and prosecutors aired the footage in court. Despicable: John Spooner , pictured last week, murdered a 13-year-old African-American boy and says he would have shot his brother too. Spooner was sentenced today to life in prison . A jury found Spooner guilty of . first-degree intentional homicide last week, a conviction carrying a . mandatory life sentence. The judge could have allowed for the . possibility of parole after 20 years, but rejected that option, citing . Spooner's lack of remorse and desire to also kill the teen's brother. Spooner, who has lung cancer and other physical ailments, will spend the rest of his life in prison. Tragedy: Darius Simmons was gunned down after his elderly neighbor wrongfully accused him of stealing several guns from his home . While . in court for his sentencing, Spooner spoke in a frail voice that was . sometimes difficult to hear and reiterated that he felt he had little . choice but to take the law into his own hands. 'They . had to rob the house,' he said. 'Why'd they do that to me? ... They . pushed me over the edge, I guess. 'I don't know. As far as being sorry, I . don't know if I did right or wrong.' Judge Jeffrey Wagner replied sternly: 'I can tell you, you did wrong. You took the life of a child.' The . defense had argued that the killing might have been reckless but not . intentional, and said Spooner didn't mean for the shot to be fatal.

He tried to fire a third one but his gun jammed. Darius' mother, Patricia Larry, has a wrongful-death lawsuit pending against Spooner. Police searched Darius' home within hours of the shooting and didn't find Spooner's weapons. Spooner . testified at trial against his attorney's advice and said he killed the . teen because he really wanted his guns back. He also acknowledged . wanting to kill Darius' older brother when he ran to his sibling's aid . as he lay dying in the street. But Spooner said he didn't shoot the . brother because he didn't want to hit any of the others who had gathered . around. Grieving: Patricia Larry, Darius Simmons' mother, watched as Spooner killed her son . When prosecutor . Mark Williams suggested Spooner killed Darius as revenge for having his . guns stolen, Spooner replied: 'I wouldn't call it revenge. I would call . it justice.' Larry recalled those words from Spooner as she asked the judge to prevent him from ever being eligible for parole. 'I . want him to be accountable for what he did to my son, Darius Simmons. I . want him to have life in prison,' she said at Monday's sentencing. 'He . showed no remorse and said justice was served. He is a menace to . society.' The sentencing . came about a week after former neighborhood watch volunteer George . Zimmerman was acquitted in Florida in the February 2012 shooting death . of Trayvon Martin, a black teen who was also unarmed. In the opening . days of Spooner's trial in Milwaukee, the judge told the jury pool to . separate the two cases. During . the trial, race – Spooner is white and Darius was black – was almost . never mentioned, except when Spooner referred to his surveillance . footage from the day of the burglary. It showed two black teenage males . walking near his house from the direction of Darius' home. Their faces . are difficult to identify and neither is carrying Spooner's guns.

"By . Emma Innes . Seven million Britons do not clean their teeth regularly, a new survey has revealed. One in seven admitted to leaving it two whole days before they picked up a toothbrush and 21 per cent also said they forget to floss. The study also revealed that 25 per cent of people spread germs by forgetting to cover their mouth when coughing and by forgetting to wash their hands after going to the toilet. Seven million Britons do not brush their teeth regularly, 21 per cent fail to floss and 25 per cent do not cover their mouth when coughing . The study, carried out by the British Dental Health Foundation, also showed that people’s attitudes to oral hygiene have not improved in the last two years. In the previous 2011 study, 28 per cent of Britons admitted not brushing their teeth once in every 24 hour period and one in seven people said they sometimes went more than two days without cleaning their teeth. But it’s not only oral hygiene habits that slip people’s minds. According to the 2013 study, more than 7.5 million adults in the UK also forget to shower. Chief Executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, Dr Nigel Carter OBE, said: ‘What surprises me the most is that some of these things are basic hygiene tasks. ‘It is troubling to learn that people still have a poor attitude when it comes to their oral health. The British Dental Health Foundation said people should brush their teeth for 2 minutes twice a day . ‘Anyone who regularly skips brushing their teeth morning or night is storing up oral health problems for the future such as tooth decay and gum disease – the biggest cause of tooth loss. ‘Brushing last thing at night removes the deposits which have built up from eating and drinking during the day, as well as removing plaque – the cause of both tooth decay and gum disease. ‘The last brush of the day also coats the teeth with fluoride, which is not washed away through eating and drinking, and continues to protect the tooth’s surface further during sleep. ‘Flossing is also something that really is not a luxury. 'Removing food stuck in between your teeth close to gum lines is a really important step to preventing gum disease, and the most effective way of doing this is to use interdental brushes or floss. ‘Brushing alone only cleans 60 per cent of the tooth's surface, so this is an excellent way of keeping plaque at bay.’ The British Dental Health Foundation recommends that people brush their teeth for two minutes twice a day using fluoride toothpaste, cut down their consumption of sugary food and drink, and visit their dentist regularly. The findings come after a Sweatband.com survey revealed that only a fifth of women wash their gym kit after every exercise session, compared to a quarter of men. The study found the most common excuses for re-using workout clothes included saving it for a bigger wash (24 per cent), that they didn’t have enough kit (22 per cent) or that they simply couldn’t be bothered (17 per cent).","21% of Britons also forget to floss regularly .

"By . Emma Innes . A father has beaten cancer after doctors removed a tumour weighing almost one and a half stone from his stomach. Barry Wilkes underwent a six hour operation to remove the massive growth, which was twice the size of his heart and weighed about 20lb. ‘The tumour in my abdomen was huge,’ said the 45-year-old, from Northfield, Birmingham. Barry Wilkes, 45, was diagnosed with cancer after suffering nausea and stomach pain - doctors found a one and a half stone tumour in his abdomen . ‘It looked twice the size of my heart on the CT scans. ‘I ended up losing 20lbs in weight while I was in hospital and the consultant said the tumour was responsible for most of that. ‘I was lucky I didn’t need chemotherapy or radiotherapy as they were able to get all the cancer through the surgery.’ Mr Wilkes went to his doctor in December 2011 after feeling sick and putting up with weeks of stomach pain. Tests revealed the tumour had grown after cancer cells spread from another growth in his bowel. The father-of-one went under the knife at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital in September last year, and both of the tumours and cancerous lymph nodes were removed. Mr Wilkes had a six hour operation to remove the tumour in his abdomen as well as a growth in his bowel and cancerous lymph nodes. He did not have to have further treatment as the surgery successfully removed all of the cancerous cells . During the surgery, surgeons were forced to remove part of Mr Wilkes' bowel meaning his body now struggles to absorb food so he has to stick to a high-calorie diet . But the surgeons were also forced to take out part of Mr Wilkes’ bowel, leaving his body less able to absorb fat and forcing him onto a diet of crumpets, white bread, sandwiches and pasta. ‘My bowel and digestive system are having to adapt to the new way of working, which will take time,’ he said. ‘It’s gradually working better but my bowel has basically been stripped back to the basics.’ Twelve months after his surgery, the Halfords manager was told his latest scan was clear and he has walked 2,013km - more than 1,250 miles - in aid of Cancer Research UK. Mr Wilkes' is now supporting Cancer Research UK's Stand Up to Cancer campaign which aims to persuade people to raise money for the charity by standing up for the whole of October 18 . Now he has urged people to support the nationwide Stand Up to Cancer day on October 18. Fundraisers can boost the fight against the disease by being sponsored to stand up for all or part of the day. Cancer Research UK spokeswoman Paula Young said: ‘Barry is an inspiration and we are calling on everyone to follow in his footsteps and unite to Stand Up To Cancer on Friday, October 18. ‘Thanks to research, more people are surviving cancer than ever before. ‘But there’s still so much more to do. It’s not technology or knowledge that is holding back our fight against cancer - it’s funding.’ For more information, visit www.standuptocancer.org.uk .","Barry Wilkes' tumour was found after he developed pain and nausea .

"By . Emma Innes . Women who are trying for a baby should tuck into a regular helping of Brussels sprouts, an expert has claimed . Many people shudder at the thought of Brussels sprouts, with their minds conjuring up images of bitter, overcooked school vegetables. But new research suggests that couples who are trying for a baby should tuck into a regular helping of the festive staple. According to studies, nine per cent of all conceptions take place over the Christmas period, making December the most fertile month of the year. Parties and festive tipples are thought to be partly responsible for this trend. However, Neema Savvides, a nutritional therapist at the Harley Street Fertility Clinic, says the increased consumption of sprouts could also play a role. She said: ‘Believe it or not, this green micro cabbage is a baby making super food. ‘Firstly, they are bursting with folic acid which is essential for boosting fertility in both men and women. ‘This vitamin rich source also increases sperm levels and helps line the womb with the right nutrients raising sperm survival chances. ‘Another benefit of this folic rich food is that it also helps to decrease the risk of miscarriages and birth defects.’ Nine per cent of all conceptions take place over the Christmas period, making December the most fertile month of the year - this is partly due to the number of parties and the increased alcohol consumption . Brussels sprouts also contain a phytonutrient called di-indolylmethane, which helps women absorb balanced levels of the hormone oestrogen. In fact, it binds to environmental oestrogens, like pesticides and hormones in meat and dairy products, and helps rid the body of excess hormones – this boosts fertility. The vegetable is also thought to lower cholesterol levels and have anti-inflammatory properties.","9% of babies are conceived in December - more than any other month .

"Doctors are calling on the Health Secretary to authorise a life-saving vaccine on the NHS that protects children against meningitis B. Bexsero, the first jab to protect against the main cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis, has been rejected so far on cost grounds. Dozens of children a year are killed by meningitis B - some within hours - but more than 100 doctors, nurses and scientists have warned that the vaccine might never be widely used. Doctors are calling on the Health Secretary to authorise a life-saving vaccine on the NHS that protects children against meningitis B . A medical funding formula employed by the Government’s official medical advisers to determine whether it can be routinely given to children says it is unlikely to be cost effective ‘at any price’. Jabs are available privately at £75 a dose and children will need four doses, although makers Novartis have offered the NHS an undisclosed discount. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which rejected the vaccine in October, is due to re-evaluate its decision shortly. A letter signed by 118 leading doctors calls on Jeremy Hunt to veto the advisory body and accept the lives of children are more important than economic arguments. A letter signed by 118 leading doctors calls on Jeremy Hunt to veto the advisory body and accept the lives of children are more important than economic arguments . Simon Nadel, a consultant in paediatric intensive care at St Mary’s Hospital, in London, who coordinated the letter, said: ‘The UK has among the worst child health outcomes in Western Europe. Jeremy Hunt can help improve this by authorising the introduction of a new vaccine for Men B, which is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in the UK. ‘It has been made available for use privately to those who can afford it, but it is a cause for concern that after years of research, a life-saving vaccine which could significantly increase protection offered to all our children, could be shelved.’ The UK has one of the highest rates of meningitis B in the world, affecting around 1,870 people each year. Anyone can get infected, with one in 10 people dying and one in three survivors suffering life-changing disability such as limb loss, brain damage and epilepsy. It kills more children under five than any other infectious disease in the UK, while teenagers are also more at risk than other age groups. Some experts say the vaccine, which protects against 88 per cent of strains, could already have saved 60 to 80 lives if it had been introduced last year. Others have attacked the JCVI’s decision because it measures health care in economic rather than humanistic terms. ‘We have no qualms about administering expensive treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy to some very sick cancer patients who will see only a minor extension of their life span at best’ said Professor John Mekalanos, of Harvard Medical School, Boston in the US. He said, in an article in Science Translational Medicine, the jab was being blocked by ‘hypothetical financial concerns of cost-effectiveness’. Critics say the calculation used by Government health economists results in a value placed on a child’s life of just 27 years, meaning the benefits of saving a child who may live for another 60 years, and the long-term care costs if a victim is left badly disabled are not properly accounted for. Neither is the severe effect of the disease on parents’ lives and NHS litigation costs. It can cost up to £3 million in support and treatment for each survivor. Figures show £28 million compensation went to families of children left permanently disabled by meningitis missed by GPs between 2008 and 2012. The JCVI used an internationally recognised formula known as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) to assess Bexsero. A QALY assesses how many extra months or years of life of a reasonable quality a person might gain as a result of a treatment. To be cost-effective, any new vaccine, cancer medicine or heart treatment should cost no more than £20-30,000 for every QALY it saves. The JCVI concluded the MenB vaccine did not meet the economic criteria at any level. However, a European Commission-funded study last year concluded the QALY system of assessing new treatments was flawed. Professor Richard Moxon, Professor of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, who was involved in producing the new jab, said if the JCVI’s stance had applied to a new vaccine against meningitis C in 1999, the disease would not have been virtually wiped out by now. He said: ‘The JCVI’s reasons - the lack of cost-effectiveness, uncertainties on its effectiveness to prevent disease and decrease person to person spread - are so similar to the unknowns surrounding the successful implementation of the MenC vaccine that many will argue that there is blatant inconsistency.’ Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ‘A new vaccine against meningitis B has been licensed, but the JCVI, our independent group of vaccine experts, is currently looking at evidence and working with the scientific community, interested groups and the manufacturer of the vaccine to find ways to resolve any uncertainties about the drug. ‘We will then be able to come to a clear answer on introducing the vaccine to the NHS.’ Sue Davie, chief executive of the Meningitis Now charity, said the JCVI should use ‘special circumstances’ to justify approval, which include the severity of the disease. She said ‘With the devastating impact of this disease, a decision based purely on cost-effectiveness is not appropriate. ‘Time lost is lives lost and we are grateful to all the medical professionals and scientists for adding their voice by signing the letter calling on the Health Secretary to make the right decision for children in the UK. ‘While the vaccine is now available privately, parents should not have to make the stark choice of whether they feed their children, keep them warm or protect them from meningitis with the vaccine costing hundreds of pounds.’","Bexsero is the first jab to protect against the main cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sleep boosts the production of brain support cells, new research has revealed. Scientists found sleep increases the reproduction of cells that form the insulating material known as myelin, which is essential for the brain to function properly. The findings could one day lead scientists to new insights about sleep’s role in brain repair and growth and a new understanding about multiple sclerosis, a disease that damages myelin. Sleep boosts the production of brain cells necessary for it to function properly, new study finds . Researchers have known for years that many genes are turned on during sleep and off during periods of wakefulness. However, it was unclear how sleep affects specific cells types, such as oligodendrocytes, which make myelin in the healthy brain and in response to injury. Much like the insulation around an electrical wire, myelin allows electrical impulses to move rapidly from one cell to the next. Doctor Chiara Cirelli and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin in the United States measured gene activity in oligodendrocytes from mice that slept or were forced to stay awake. They found that genes promoting myelin formation were turned on during sleep. In contrast, the genes implicated in cell death and the cellular stress response were turned on when the animals stayed awake. Dr Cirelli speculated the findings, . published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggest that extreme and/or . chronic sleep loss could possibly aggravate some symptoms of multiple . sclerosis (MS). University of Wisconsin research showed sleeping helps growth of myelin which allows electrical impulses to move rapidly from one cell to the next . She said . that future experiments may examine whether or not an association . between sleep patterns and severity of MS symptoms exists. Additional analysis revealed that the reproduction of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) - cells that become oligodendrocytes - doubles during sleep, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM), which is associated with dreaming. Dr Cirelli said: 'For a long time, sleep researchers focused on how the activity of nerve cells differs when animals are awake versus when they are asleep. 'Now it is clear that the way other supporting cells in the nervous system operate also changes significantly depending on whether the animal is asleep or awake.' Doctor Mehdi Tafti, who studies sleep at . the University of Lausanne in Switzerland but was not involved in the . study, said: 'These findings hint at how sleep or lack of sleep might . repair or damage the brain.'","Research by University of Wisconsin showed sleep boosts myelin .

Ryan Au made the video, which he posted on YouTube, as a way of showing young people how damaging the habit is. It shows an air pump inflating two sets of pigs’ lungs as though they are breathing. Both pairs of lungs are completely healthy at the start of the experiment. However, one set is allowed to ‘breathe’ clean air, while the other ‘smokes’ 60 cigarettes. At the end of the experiment, Mr Au compares the two sets of lungs. The video also shows that after just 60 cigarettes the windpipe has been stained brown . It is obvious to the naked eye that the lungs exposed to cigarette smoke have become seriously discoloured. Indeed, while the non-smoking lungs remain a healthy pink colour, the smoking ones have taken on a yellowish-brown hue. In the film, Mr Au also dissects the pigs’ windpipes and reveals that the non-smoking lungs have a healthy, pale pink trachea while the smoking lungs’ windpipe is clogged and stained a dark shade of brown.","Ryan Au, a teacher in Hong Kong, made the video to show students how dangerous smoking is after becoming concerned by his students starting .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Teenager Beckii Handy refused to have a hysterectomy despite being diagnosed with ovarian cancer . A 15-year-old turned down a hysterectomy despite becoming one of the youngest women in the UK to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Beckii Handy visited her GP, complaining of what she thought was indigestion. But she and her parents Jan and Chrys Handy, were shocked when doctors revealed the teenager was suffering a type of cancer, more often diagnosed in women over the age of 50. As part of the treatment doctors suggested was a hysterectomy - the removal of the womb, which would have left Beckii unable to carry her own children. But the teenager bravely refused, determined to maintain her fertility and ability to bear children. 'The doctor started to examine me and it became very painful,' she said. 'I was sent for tests but I never dreamed I would be told I had cancer.' Beckii, from Solihull in the West Midlands, bravely refused a hysterectomy to maintain her hopes of having children in the future. 'There was no way I was having it and they couldn’t do it without my permission,' she said. 'Due to my stubbornness, I can hopefully now go on and have children.' Beckii was diagnosed in August 2011 and underwent two types of chemotherapy treatment. The now 18-year-old was given the all-clear in January 2012. She has forged links with the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust, which gives young people in recovery from cancer the chance to rebuild their confidence through sailing. And earlier this month she teamed up with British Olympic sailing star Sir Ben Ainslie to take part in the J.P Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race around the Isle of Wight. 'When you get the all clear, people expect you to have this big celebration but it is something I really struggled to deal with,' Beckii said. 'You’re left thinking: ""Well, what now?"" The Trust has been amazing and I have made some great friends through it. 'If I had not gone to the doctor that day, I probably would not be here now.' Diagnosed at 15, Beckii is thought to be among the youngest women in the UK to be diagnosed with the disease, which is usually seen in older women. Beckii is pictured with her mother Jan Handy . Beckii was diagnosed in August 2011 and underwent two types of chemotherapy treatment. The now 18-year-old was given the all-clear in January 2012 . She also urged teenagers to have any health problems checked out promptly. 'I get annoyed when friends tell me they have aches and pains but they haven’t been to the see the doctor,' she said. 'I think young people can get embarrassed about going to the doctor but what is a bit of embarrassment if it saves your life?' The J.P Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race is one of the largest participation sporting events in the UK and the largest yacht race of its kind in the world. Organised by the Island Sailing Club in Cowes, it has been dubbed ‘Britain’s favourite yacht race’, regularly attracting around 1,500 boats and 16,000 competitors.","Beckii Handy went to see her GP thinking she had indigestion in 2011 .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Sam Owen caught deadly Weil's disease after kayaking in dirty river water . A kayaker is lucky to be alive after contracting a potentially fatal disease from dirty river water. Sam Owen, 24, believes the bacteria from rat urine entered his body through his eyes and nose, as well as grazes on his hands from rock climbing. He was rushed to hospital after he began vomiting and suffering excruciating back ache before being diagnosed with Weil's disease, which attacks the organs and can be fatal. Mr Owen, of Petersfield, Hampshire, said: 'I read there was two weeks from when you contract it to going pass the point of surviving. I was 17 days so I shouldn't have survived. 'I am extremely lucky and grateful to be alive.' Mr Owen was on an outdoor instructor course and spent the weekend in Wales rock climbing. 'I came back and was kayaking in the Itchen River, in Southampton. It was the first time I have ever kayaked. 'I was learning to capsize with a girl who didn't quite have the strength to turn me over, so I was capsizing a lot more than others in my group. 'I found out that Weil's disease could get in through your eyes, nose and through the scrapes on skin, which I had from climbing - I think that was the cause.' After returning to his job a few days later as a full-time lifeguard, he came home from a shift and started throwing up blood. His worried mother dialled 111 who suggested he see a doctor the following day - and he was sent   straight to hospital. He said: 'While I was in hospital a couple of my friends visited. They said ""you look really, really green"". 'While I was on the ward I ate a small meal and began throwing up black sick. It wasn't very nice.' After five days in ITU, his consultant quizzed Mr Owen on everything he'd been doing until he became ill. 'As soon as I told him about the kayaking I was given an antidote to try and fight the disease. 'Weil’s disease is a form of a bacterial infection also known as . Leptospirosis that is carried by animals, most commonly in rats and . cattle. Mr Owen believes bacteria from rats urine in the river water entered his body through his eyes and nose, and grazes from rock climbing . He spent five days in ITU battling the disease, which attacks the kidney and liver. Cases of Weil's disease, symptoms of which can include a purple rash, reached record levels this year . Weil’s disease is a form of a bacterial infection also known as leptospirosis. It is carried by animals, most commonly in rats and cattle. It can be caught by humans through contact with rat or cattle urine, most commonly through contaminated fresh water. The disease can be transmitted through cuts and scratches or the lining of the mouth, throat or eyes. Symptoms include a a high temperature ) that is usually between 38 and 40°C, chills,  sudden headaches, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, muscle pain - particularly in the calves and lower back, conjunctivitis (irritation and redness of the eyes), a cough, a short-lived rash . It can be caught by humans through contact with rat or cattle . urine, most commonly occurring through contaminated fresh water.' It attacks the kidney, liver, before making its way through your organs. There were 70 hospital admissions for Weil's disease last year - more than any other 12-month period in the past ten years and double the figure for two years ago, according to NHS records. The illness - also known as leptospirosis - has claimed four lives in the UK since 2009. Olympic rowing champion Andy Holmes died of Weil's disease in 2010 aged 51, after it is believed the bacteria entered his body through blisters on his hands. Dr John Knighton, a critical care consultant based in Portsmouth, said: 'The disease is fairly rare. It is a bacteria that is transmitted through the urine of rats; infected rates urinate into an environment that allows the bacteria into humans. 'That either occurs from swallowing or enters the body through a break in the skin be that cuts or grazes. 'Drain workers, farm workers and vets who have occupational exposure are most vulnerable. 'We believe Sam got it because he had been canoeing in the river three weeks before. He has recovered very well but it can be fatal.'","Sam Owen, 24, was diagnosed with Weil's disease, which attacks the organs .

"By . Joani Walsh . Having . travelled to The Gambia every year for more than a decade on family . holidays, nurse Victoria Ord knew what precautions to take. Her . vaccinations were up to date and she had packed enough high-factor . sunscreen to protect all of her extended family during their two-week . trip. She also started taking daily anti-malarial medication before she left Britain to ensure she was protected. Victoria Ord's malaria pills stopped working after a stomach bug while in Gambia . Despite . her medical training, however, Victoria, 37, did not know that the . 24-hour stomach bug she picked up halfway through the holiday would . render those doxycyline tablets useless. And the bug, although unpleasant, was not even that severe. 'I . had my birthday during the holiday and woke up feeling sick that day so . skipped breakfast, but took my anti-malarial as usual and had just a . cup of tea,' says Victoria. 'About an hour later I started vomiting and . carried on being sick for the rest of the morning.' She was well . enough to go out later for a birthday dinner with her husband Jay, 41, . and ten-year-old daughter Madison, joined by the rest of the family, . although she didn't have much of an appetite. By the next day she was . feeling better, but the damage had been done. Within four days of . returning home, Victoria was in a resuscitation room in A&E, . delirious and too weak even to stand. She had malaria, which can be . deadly. Just this weekend, 21-year-old British aid worker Christi Kelly . died in Kenya after contracting the disease. She, too, had been taking . anti-malarials. Victoria had visited a wetland area known for its mosquitoes, but hadn't even noticed the bite mark . Tests revealed Victoria had falciparum malaria, the . most severe form of the disease, and she was immediately taken to . intensive care where she was put into an induced coma. At one point, Jay . was warned his wife might not survive. Victoria had visited a wetland area known for its mosquitoes, but hadn't even noticed the bite mark from the insect. 'Because I'd been taking my anti-malarials every day I never thought I could be at risk,' she says. The . problem with doxycycline and most other popular anti-malarials is that . they have to be taken every day to keep enough levels in the blood to . suppress malaria as it's developing, explains Dr Nick Beeching, senior . lecturer at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. 'So a period of . sickness or diarrhoea, even over just a day or two, could leave you less . protected - and it takes a little while afterwards for the medication . to return to optimum levels,' he says. And it's not just . anti-malarials. The potency of any daily medicine, including those for . long-standing conditions, can be affected by sickness and diarrhoea, . says Sultan Dajani, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. 'If you've . vomited within three hours of taking medication, its effect will be . compromised,' he says. 'And if you're on medication for cardiovascular . or stroke-related conditions - to regulate heartbeat, control blood . pressure or prevent blood clots, for instance - that could be life . threatening.' Often those on medication are unaware that they are, in effect, missing a dose if they have a stomach upset. 'People . think that once a pill is swallowed, the effect is immediate,' says Dr . Tony Steele, GP and medical director of the Dr Fox online clinic. 'Vomiting or diarrhoea can effectively mean a missed dose and it can be . critical - enough to throw some patients on medication for heart . problems into heart failure.' Dr Steele has known of patients on the . blood-thinning drug Warfarin to suffer a blood clot because of a missed . dose through an upset stomach. There are others at risk, too. For women . taking the contraceptive ill, even a minor stomach upset can reduce  its . effectiveness and result in  an unplanned pregnancy. With drugs that . have a long-lasting effect, such as thyroxine for thyroid problems or . medication for osteoporosis, a couple of days of sickness won't cause . too much of a problem, according to Mr Dajani. But, he warns: . 'Losing a day's worth of epilepsy, asthmatic drugs (excluding inhalers) or those for mental health conditions such as schizophrenia can have . serious consequences.' Diarrhoea can be more problematic than vomiting. The resulting dehydration and the effect this has on your levels of . potassium and sodium (electrolytes that help regulate fluid levels) can . also affect how drugs are absorbed, adds Dr Steele. 'This can, for instance make digoxin, which regulates irregular heartbeat, ineffective.' So if you are on daily medication and have an upset stomach what should you do? 'You . should repeat the dose as soon as possible and seek medical advice if . you are sick again within three hours of taking the replacement dose,' advises Mr Dajani. With diarrhoea you should also keep up your . fluids and take rehydration sachets to replace lost electrolytes. And . make sure you discuss a sick-day management plan before you even go away . - again, with your pharmacist or GP. 'Everyone should know what to . do in unforeseen circumstances - if they become ill with another . condition that may affect their medication, they lose their drugs, their . tablets get wet or, say, they're on insulin which needs to be kept in a . fridge, but there's a blackout at their resort,' says Mr Dajani. Victoria . started to become seriously ill the day after she returned home to . Stockport, Cheshire, in November 2011. Her symptoms began during her . first night shift back at Stepping Hill Hospital. 'I felt freezing . cold and so achy the next morning, that I went straight to bed when I . came home and didn't have the strength to get up again,' she explains. 'But I thought I'd just picked up flu coming back to a cold November . from the heat of The Gambia.' Victoria pictured in hospital with multi-organ failure . After three days without any . improvement, Jay, a hospital driver, had noticed Victoria's breathing . quickening as she slept, and that her golden tan appeared to be turning . yellow. 'He contacted our GP who said I'd already called and been . told it was probably flu - but I was becoming delirious,' Victoria . recalls. 'Jay told him I couldn't remember making the call and asked . if I'd mentioned we'd just returned from Africa. The GP ordered Jay to . get me straight to hospital.' Jay had to support his wife down the . stairs to their car to take her to A&E at Stepping Hill, where she . rapidly began to deteriorate. 'Doctors were able to tell quite quickly . from looking at my blood that it was malaria, but I didn't believe them. I kept telling them I had been taking the pills, that I'd been “good” and done what I was told,' Victoria says. She was transferred to . intensive care where she was put into an induced coma - she also . developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, inflammation of the lungs . that reduces oxygen levels in the blood, and had to be put on a . ventilator. She needed dialysis to help her kidneys function as they . were failing as a result of blackwater fever, a complication of malaria . caused by red blood cells bursting in the bloodstream as they are . infiltrated by the malaria parasite. The number of Britons who suffer from gastroenteritis each year . She was also suffering from jaundice and cerebral malaria as the parasite caused inflammation of the blood vessels of the brain. Treatment . began immediately with intravenous doxycycline, an antibiotic, and . quinine to clear the parasite from her bloodstream. 'I was brought . round every day for doctors to be able to monitor my reactions for . improvements. It was the scariest part because I was so disorientated. 'I . could see balloons and bright lights and thought I was in a freight . container being taken back to The Gambia to be married off.' She was . transferred to North Manchester General Hospital's infectious diseases . and tropical medicine unit. It took another two weeks - while she . remained in a  coma - before she started to improve. It took three weeks before she was allowed to return home and ten months before she was well enough to return to work. A . recent survey for online doctor service Pharmacy2U found one in ten had . travelled without vaccinations or malaria medication - many lured by a . last-minute deal. 'Putting a holiday before your health is very . foolish, not least because these diseases can be fatal and are often . also a horrible way to die,' says Dr Beeching. 'Neither can you ignore . minor health problems because their impact can be similarly . devastating.' Victoria is now all too aware of this. 'I thought I . was doing everything I could, without ever realising the impact of a . minor stomach bug on my good intentions.' malarianomore.org.uk .","Victoria Ord, 37, knew what precautions to take on a trip to Gambia .

Children who are diagnosed with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder because their mothers drink excessively during pregnancy are at higher risk of having impaired gross motor skills, Sydney researchers found. The Sydney University and George Institute led study has shown children exposed to alcohol in the womb have problems with balance, coordination and ball skills. Barbara Lucas, study co-author and Sydney Medical School researcher, reviewed past studies to see how a child's gross motor skills, which includes sitting up and rolling over, might be affected by their mothers consuming alcohol. The Sydney University and George Institute led study has shown children exposed to alcohol in the womb have problems with balance, coordination and ball skills . 'We have found children with a foetal alcohol spectrum disorder diagnosis are three times more likely to have gross motor impairment,' Ms Lucas told The Daily Telegraph. 'They may also have difficulty participating in particular activities with peers, with flow-on effect including lower self-confidence and reduced opportunities for interaction.' Ms Lucas was unable to determine exactly what proportion of children exposed to alcohol in the womb had gross motor problems. The study compared children up to 18 years of age with the disorder, moderate to heavy alcohol exposure in the womb or an alcoholic mother to children without prenatal alcohol problems. Researchers found prenatal alcohol exposure for babies could have long-term consequences and said just one drink a day could cause brain and peripheral nerve damage.","Study showed children exposed to alcohol in womb have problems with balance, coordination and balls skills .

If he stays injury free he will be back in the England squad.’ Sunderland hope that signing Rodwell will encourage Fabio Borini to join them.

"By . Jane Shilling . Being a professional sportsman is a short-lived career. ‘All footballers know that the end is nigh,’ writes The Secret Wag in her mesmerising memoir of the highs and lows of being a top footballer’s wife. In the light of England’s World Cup disaster, it’s a remarkably prescient reflection. She reveals that her husband (‘my man’) is an England international nearing the end of his career. Here come the girls: WAGs hit the hotspots of Baden Baden during the World Cup in Germany in 2006 . And no doubt while ‘hurting bad’, as England captain Steven Gerrard eloquently described his post-World Cup mood, the Secret Wag’s nameless husband will be drawing consolation from his wife’s rollicking account of her career as a WAG. More of that later. But first, the question that we’re all dying to ask: how do you get to be a WAG? ‘Many WAGs seem to be in denial about how they got together with their man,’ writes our guide to the secrets of WAGdom (let’s call her SW for short). ‘However, denial is not just a river in Egypt.’ Oh, stop it, do! She’s not just a WAG, but a wag as well. ‘The fact is that most WAGs met their footballing fellas when they were drunk as skunks and hanging around in the VIP areas in a nightclub.’ Hurting bad: WAG Coleen Rooney in the crowd as England play Uruguay, final score 2-1 . That, at any rate, is how our girl got lucky. She was 18 and newly arrived at an unnamed university. (Studying what? Classics? Astrophysics? Nail Art? Alas, SW is maddeningly vague on detail). After working hard for her A-levels, she was ‘single and very much ready to mingle’. A favourite mingling spot was the ‘biggest nightclub in the city where, on a Saturday night, the Premiership footballers could always be found’. Not that SW was on the lookout for them: ‘I certainly wasn’t a one-night stand kind of girl and was not willing to become a used piece of footballer’s meat.’ ‘However, I found myself’ — as you do — ‘at the club for an 18th birthday party. I was dressed in tartan hotpants and a lace backless top with no bra. I teamed my outfit with black pointy stilettos and a black leather bag covered with metal studs.’ Though not otherwise gifted with acute powers of observation, SW can always be relied on when it comes to the minutiae of a saucy get-up. Her fashion notes on the outfits she wears to entice her husband are especially helpful. ‘I’ve worn the classic nurse outfit, maid outfit and naughty-schoolgirl outfit . . . When I dress in my PVC halter-neck teddy-suit lingerie that my husband spontaneously bought me, I play the dominatrix role . . .’ I’m sure we all wish that our own husbands would be as spontaneous. Meanwhile, back at the nightclub, the tartan hotpants worked their magic. Standing at the bar was a chap wearing ‘a lightweight casual jacket over a T-shirt, dark-blue denim jeans, bright-white trainers and his hair was spiked-up. Every item of his clothing sported a designer label and his look was streets ahead of how most of the chavvy blokes in the club chose to dress.’ Gucci's soft stirrup crocodile shoulder bag - a WAG favourite - costs £19,000 . Having ascertained that he wasn’t a chav, SW engaged the handsome stranger in conversation. ‘I know we didn’t discuss anything intellectual since he was a footballer and . . . I was trolleyed. ‘We engaged in light pleasantries. Then, to my surprise, he invited me to do a tequila slammer.’ Concluding from his courtly behaviour that she’d picked a good one, SW permitted him to take her to the cinema. ‘I decided on dark-denim flared jeans, high black ankle boots, and a shimmery, sleeveless top. For quirkiness, I completed the ensemble with a black bowler hat.’ He was wearing double denim and ordered ‘a man-mountain of snacks’, but didn’t try to kiss her. SW was disappointed, but ‘even with food and drink falling out of his mouth, I found him immensely attractive’. Footballing royalty: David and Victoria Beckham are the power couple of the football . He eventually made a move and, not long afterwards, she found herself wearing a blindfold in a stretch limo, on her way to a restaurant where they feasted on foie gras (‘As an animal lover I resolved that, tasty as it was, I’d not eat it again’). With the steak and creme brulee out of the way, her chap lowered himself to one knee and handed her a little box. Ever the lady: ‘The voice in my head screamed, “Oh, s***!” ’ And who can blame her. It was a large square diamond set in a thin band of platinum. Every WAG’s dream. The wedding was a corker, bankrolled by a well-known glossy magazine. Their guests wouldn’t be allowed to take any photographs, and ‘we had to guarantee that we’d have a substantial number of famous faces at our wedding’. But ‘we knew that we wanted to share our big day with as many people as possible: since the magazine’s readership was several million people worldwide, we figured that was . . . a box ticked’. They’re all heart, this pair. And never more so than when it comes to good works. ‘With regard to our charity work, WAG should stand for “Worthwhile and Generous”.’ Of course, the perfect life of a WAG is not without its own problems. SW struggles with her weight (‘I have only very recently concluded that fad diets do not work’). More seriously, she reveals that she has suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder, and endured difficulties in becoming pregnant that were compounded by an early miscarriage. Happily, the safe arrival of a carefully unspecified number of children and a diet of freshly steamed vegetables restored the marital equilibrium to the point at which rumours of infidelity in a tabloid newspaper were calmly dismissed (‘I picked up my dressing-table chair and hurled it at his head’). 'I will not miss the public exposure that WAGdom has brought, not one little bit' Secret WAG . And now, in the painful aftermath of the World Cup defeat, it may be all over. About time, too, according to SW: ‘I will not miss the public exposure that WAGdom has brought, not one little bit.’ Poor Mr SW may be broken and hurting after England’s recent World Cup humiliation, but he’s got his impressive property portfolio to fall back on, along with an ambition to get into punditry, doubtless inspired by Phil Neville’s unstoppable fluency. Meanwhile, SW ‘vows to live in the shadows only as long as my husband is basking in the sunshine, and he’s had enough to last him a lifetime. It’ll soon be my time to shine.’ Watch out, Victoria Beckham. It sounds as though nothing short of world domination will do.","The Secret WAG says most future WAGS meet their footballing fellas when they're drunk in nightclubs .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Simple lifestyle changes could prevent almost two fifths of cases of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of the disease, a leading charity claims. Each year around 8,800 people in the UK are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, of whom fewer than 4 per cent are likely to live five years. But 37 per cent could have saved themselves from the disease by maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking, according to Cancer Research UK. Launching a major push to combat pancreatic cancer, the charity’s director of early diagnosis, Sara Hiom, said: 'Cancer is a complex set of diseases. Cancer Research UK said simple lifestyle changes, including maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking, could help two fifths of pancreatic cancer patients save themselves from the deadly disease . 'For some, lifestyle can play an important role, and is one aspect of the disease that we have some control over. 'Pancreatic cancer is a disease with poor outcomes and is less well understood, so it’s important that we talk about the things people can do to stack the odds in their favour and reduce their risk.' The contribution of poor lifestyle to pancreatic cancer is outlined in research published in the British Journal of Cancer. Professor Jeff Evans, a clinician and scientist at Cancer Research UK’s Beatson Institute in Glasgow, said he found it 'devastating' when he had to break the bad news to a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer. He added: 'Survival for this disease remains shockingly low and this has to change. 'There’s an urgent need to tackle pancreatic cancer head on by building up an armoury of effective new treatments - and developing ways to diagnose this disease sooner, when surgery is more effective. 'At the same time it’s important to remember that people can take steps to reduce their risk of developing pancreatic and other cancers, by not smoking and by keeping a healthy weight, especially if you are prone to carrying too much around your middle. Each year around 8,800 people in the UK are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, of whom fewer than 4 per cent are likely to live five years. Pictured is a cluster of pancreatic cancer cells under the microscope . 'Keeping physically active and cutting down on red meat may also help reduce the risk.' Cancer Research UK chief executive Dr Harpal Kumar said: 'Pancreatic cancer is rarely in the spotlight. 'Unlike most other cancers where we’ve seen survival rates climb, outcomes for pancreatic cancer remain desperately poor. 'This is why Cancer Research UK has made this terrible disease a research priority in our recent strategy, and we plan to more than double the amount we spend on pancreatic cancer research over the next few years. 'There is a long way to go, so we intend to move quickly to ensure that we make as rapid progress as possible in fighting this devastating disease.'","Cancer Research UK said a healthy lifestyle can help combat the disease .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Henri Lansbury will not sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest and is set to instead join Burnley in a deal worth around £3.5million as he looks to fulfil his ambition for Premier League football. Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi has challenged Lansbury, 23, to put pen to paper on a deal first offered in February but it is understood that the terms are significantly less than other team-mates and he has informed manager Stuart Pearce of his intention to leave. Burnley boss Sean Dyche is keen on the midfielder, who has scored 12 goals in 53 starts since moving to the City Ground from Arsenal for £1m in 2012, and would offer regular game time. Off you go: Henri Lansbury has snubbed a new offer from Nottingham Forest and is set to join Burnley . Getting ready: Lansbury trains with Forest ahead of the new season . It is believed to be another deal that initially progressed without Pearce’s full knowledge, after the sales of Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow, with negotiations advancing between officials from Forest and Burnley until Lansbury told his manager about his desire to go last week. Pearce has since reluctantly agreed to sanction the move if the right bid is made, rather than have an unhappy player in his squad, and there is still work to be done over a price. Forest are believed to be holding out for a fee nearer £5m. Pearce and Al-Hasawi have been locked in a war of words after Lascelles and Darlow were sold to Newcastle United for a combined £7m before being loaned back for the season. One-time Gunner: Lansbury began his career at Arsenal before joining Nottingham Forest in 2012 . International star: Lansbury is also a former England Under 21 star, winning 16 caps for the Three Lions . Pearce said the transfers were conducted without his knowledge, adding: ‘I am not prepared to fluff things when it comes to what was said and done behind the scenes. Two players were sold against my will. It disappointed me.’ Al Hasawi hit back and claimed the manager had been consulted, saying: ‘The manager and I openly discussed the proposed sale of Karl and Jamaal and he was aware of the negotiations throughout. ‘Sadly for me, there is no room for sentimentality in the running of a football club and it is up to me to start making some tough decisions to preserve the long-term sustainability of Nottingham Forest.’ Al Hasawi then discussed Lansbury, explaining: ‘Clearly he is a talented player who we don’t want to lose. He rejected my offer of a new contract earlier this year but that deal remains on the table. ‘He has two more years to run on his current contract and we hope he will play a huge part for us this season. It is now time for Henri to make his decision.’ Stars: But Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow were sold on the cheap to Premier League side Newcastle United . Dispute: Fawaz Al Hasawi has hit back at Stuart Pearce's claims he was left in the dark at Nottingham Forest . Pearce has said publicly he does not want to lose Lansbury, a graduate of the Arsenal academy, and called him one of the Championship’s best players. But the former England Under-21 boss is aware of the pressures to meet financial fair play. Pearce said: ‘I certainly hope we will not be losing any other players. The only ones I would want to move out is the ones I give the proviso to move out, who are not helpful to me. ‘If I get asked the question, I will give an honest answer over who should and shouldn't go. Hopefully, more often than not, the owners will take my guidance on that. ‘I wouldn't want Henri to go. I know there's been interest, but I would not want him to go. That is where I stand on him. I've had a long connection with him at international level and I want that to continue at club level. ‘He is one of the better players in the Championship, if not one of the best in the top echelons of the division overall. Can he play in the Premier League? Yes he can in my opinion. ‘There's been interest in Henri, but nothing anywhere near our valuation. We all turned it down – we are in unity on that one.’","Henri Lansbury to turn down Nottingham Forest deal and move to Burnley .

"By . Jenny Awford . Captain Jeremy Sudlow, 28, attacked two barmen at Fulham Wine Rooms, London, after he was told to leave -  10 minutes after ordering two bottles of wine . A Cavalry officer has been fined £1,500 for attacking two barmen who were closing up - despite having sold him two bottles of wine just 10 minutes earlier. Captain Jeremy Sudlow, 28, punched and slapped  the men at Fulham Wine Rooms in Parsons Green, southwest London, as they attempted to close the bar at around midnight. The officer, who serves in the Household Cavalry Regiment based in Windsor had just spent £50 on two bottles of wine for his table and was angry that he was not given time to finish. He became aggressive and spoke rudely to the bar manager before punching another barman in the face on 16 May this year, Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court heard. Prosecutor Stella Waata said: ‘Mr Sudlow was with a group of friends and whilst there they proceeded to consume a lot of wine though the evening and had been very noisy, disruptive and abusive through the evening. ‘Towards closing time, about midnight, Robert Bateman - one of the victims - asked the table of Mr Sudlow to finish up so that they could close.’ But the intoxicated soldier, from Castle Cary, Somerset, who has also served in the parachute regiment and fought in Afghanistan, became angry and shouted at the bar staff. ‘Mr Bateman says he returned to the table approximately five minutes later when he was again rudely spoken to,’ said Ms Waata. The assault took place at the Fulham Wine Rooms in Parsons Green, southwest London, in May this year . ‘The second victim, John Atkinson, tried to pick up a glass of wine which still had a little wine left in it. ‘Mr Sudlow squared up to Mr Atkinson and then punched him with his right hand with a closed fist to the left side of his face. ‘Mr Atkinson returns to the counter where he began to call police. ‘In the meantime, Mr Bateman had gone to the table and attempted to clear up the table. ‘Mr Sudlow then slapped Mr Bateman around the back of his head.’ The officer was arrested shortly after the attacks and taken to the police station. ‘He stated his memory was slightly fuzzy, he had a glass of wine taken out of his hand, he knows he tried to get it back or get a refund,’ said Ms Waata. The disgraced soldier wore a dark grey suit and a bright blue spotted tie for his appearance at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court in London today. Sudlow has been fined £1,200 and branded a 'complete idiot' ‘He can’t remember punching anyone, he does remember slapping someone and if he had punched someone he would remember it.’ Today Ludlow pleaded guilty to two counts of assault. Tim Lawson-Cruttenden, defending, said: ‘At about closing time he had been drinking there all evening, he bought two bottles of wine which cost £50 and it was literally ten minutes before the wine bar was going to close and he expected to be given the opportunity of drinking that - he had spent £50 on it.’ Mr Sudlow was ordered to pay  nearly £2,000 today at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court - including fines and court costs - after he attacked two barmen in May this year . He told the court Sudlow’s ‘grossly bad behaviour’ was triggered when Mr Atkinson attempted to take his wine glass. Sudlow, whose career hangs in the balance, has been ordered to carry out community service by his commanding officer and was sent to a doctor, the court heard. ‘He is a person of previous good character, he has served this country in Afghanistan in a very difficult situation, his military career is going to be in jeopardy,’ said Mr Lawson-Cruttenden. ‘This was bad behaviour, bad drinking behaviour, but we are looking at the lowest level of behaviour as far as this court is concerned.’ But Lead Magistrate Greg Thomson said: ‘Despite what has been said on your behalf, this is a serious offence. Mr Sudlow (not pictured) serves in the Household Cavalry Regimet based in Windsor, Berkshire, but his career now hangs in the balance . ‘There are a number of aggravating features, the first of which was the location- it was a wine bar. ‘The timing - it was closing time when people had had a lot to drink. ‘The third was that you chose to assault two members of staff who were simply trying to do their job.’ He added: ‘It was also an aggravating factor that there was more than one assault and in the first assault you used a clenched fist. ‘Happily for you there were no serious injuries.’ Mr Ludlow studied at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester. The soldier, whose address is given as the Officers Mess at Hyde Park Barracks, was slapped with a £750 fine for each assault. He was ordered to pay £100 compensation to both his victims, a further £75 victim surcharge and £85 towards the prosecution costs. The Magistrate added: ‘I want to emphasise to you this was a shocking lack of judgement on your part. You were a complete idiot.’ Sudlow has been a member of the armed forces since 2009 and ran this year’s Virgin London Marathon as part of an army team, clocking a time of 3.09.","Captain Jeremy Sudlow, 28, punched and slapped two barmen in May .

Actor and comedian Rik Mayall had a heart attack after coming back from his usual morning run, his wife said today. Barbara Mayall said the 56-year-old suffered an 'acute cardiac event' when he returned to his home in Barnes, south-west London, on Monday. She said: 'We now know that our darling Rik suffered an 'acute cardiac event' at our home around midday on June 9th. 'He had just returned from his usual run and many people had seen him that morning.' Mrs Mayall thanked the press 'for their discretion' and 'all the wonderful coverage', adding: 'It would have made him very happy.' She added: 'I am sure that you all know Rik's response would be something along the lines of.....""well thanks very much all of you.............now f*** off!!!""' The announcement from his devastated wife came just hours after a post-mortem into his death proved inconclusive. Earlier today, a spokesman for West London Coroners Court said today that more tests will have to be carried out to determine exactly how the 56-year-old died. Yesterday fans began an online campaign to get his unreleased World Cup song to number one. DJ Jon Morter, who calls himself the ‘charts hijacker’, has appealed to people on Facebook to get the 'lost' track, Noble England, to the top of the charts. Speaking yesterday he urged people to . buy Mr Mayall's song which features him reciting the stirring speech . from Shakespeare's Henry . V over a football chant. The track, which he recorded for the 2010 tournament, failed to chart initially, but it jumped 27 places overnight according to data from the Official Charts Company and is now just outside the top 10 at number 11. Just a day before he was found dead at his home, Mr Mayall was photographed walking his dog. Following the Blackadder star's death, his wife, said he had a 'strong heart' and added: 'I don't think it was a heart attack, but we just don't know until the coroner's report. The mother of Mr Mayall's children, Rosie, . 28, Sidney, 26, and Bonnie, 18, said: ‘Maybe he had a fit, maybe it was . his heart. We just don’t know.’ His devastated family used . social media in the aftermath to pay tribute to the ‘wonderful, generous, . foul-mouthed’ comedy star. As . friends revealed that Mayall appeared happy and healthy only half an . hour before his death, his daughter Bonnie, 18, wrote: ‘My dad was loved . not only by my family, but by many, many others. ‘We . will never forget him and neither will the world. RIP to the man, the . myth, the legend – my wonderful, generous, foul-mouthed and hysterical . father. My idol now and forever. We love you daddy.’ Their . tributes came after family friend and Comic Strip founder, Peter . Richardson, 62, told how his son spoke to Mr Mayall just half an hour . before he died, saying he 'chatted away happily' and 'seemed so happy . and so healthy'. Scroll down for video .

Referring to Mr Mayall's 1998 quad bike accident, which left him in a temporary coma, Mr Richardson said: 'Well, he had 16 years after the quad bike - at the time I don't think people thought he would survive that. 'But he lived for another 16 years, and it was just shocking that he went: he was so happy and seemed very healthy when he did go.'

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . As the original cockney pop stars they fill their lyrics with rhyming slang and sing in their East End accents. So if anyone was a fan of EastEnders you would think it would be the veteran singing duo Chas & Dave. Instead, the pair have accused the BBC soap of being ‘totally unrealistic’, and say the world they grew up in has now vanished for good. Londoners: Pop stars Chas (left) and Dave (right) say EastEnders is unrealistic, and fails to capture the spirit of East London . Dave Peacock, 69, who was brought up in Enfield, said: ‘EastEnders completely misses the sense of humour in the East End that was fostered in the Blitz. ‘The BBC think the East End has got to be gloomy, but it doesn’t at all. East Enders are cheerful. They’ve only got the accents, but not the spirit of the people. It isn’t true to the area in the slightest. ‘I think Englishness has probably changed since we started. London has certainly changed. The old Londoners don’t seem to be around like they were anymore. They have died out. Everything changes. ‘I do get disappointed by some things in our country, but other things are great.’ Lacking humour: Dave says EastEnders 'completely misses the sense of humour in the East End that was fostered in the Blitz' Chas & Dave’s major breakthrough was with the track Gertcha in 1979, which peaked at number 20 in the charts. They have gone on to make nine best-selling albums and continue to tour around the UK. Other well-known hits sung in their unique ‘rockney’ style include Rabbit and Ain’t No Pleasing You. Last month they were given the Icon Award at the annual Nordoff Robbins Silver Clef music awards. Chas, whose real name is Charles Hodges, said the secret to the band’s success was their early decision to sing in their own accents. He said: ‘We simply became ourselves. Singing in the way that we speak about things we know about. Some people assumed we couldn’t be real cockneys and we must be putting it on because it was such an unusual thing to do. ‘Before that I did Jerry Lee Lewis take offs in an American accent.’ The 70-year-old grew up in Edmonton, north London, but his family is also from the East End. He said: ‘The whole place has changed beyond recognition. Everything changes, but you shouldn’t keep harping on about the past. ‘We have never set out to stand up for one particular view of Britain. We just try to be ourselves and play the music we like.’","Dave Peacock, 69, says BBC soap 'misses the sense of humour'

"By . Harriet Arkell . Chloe Wilkes, 17, who left school last year, was found collapsed at home in Singleton, Kent, and died in hospital later that same day . A father has appeared in court accused of the manslaughter of his 17 year-old daughter who died after taking MDMA at home. Jason Wilkes, 44, has also been charged with conspiracy to supply the illegal drug following the death of Chloe Wilkes. She was found collapsed at her semi-detached home in Ashford, Kent on July 27 and taken to the William Harvey Hospital but pronounced dead later the same day. Wilkes appeared before magistrates in Folkestone two days later and was remanded in custody to appear at Canterbury Crown Court on August 18. Today her teachers and friends paid tribute to the 'sweet' teenager on a Facebook page set up in her memory. Jon Whitcombe, headmaster of The North School in Ashford, which Chloe left last year, said: 'These are a desperately sad set of circumstances and our thoughts are with family and friends at this most difficult of times.' Chloe's friend Tiffany King set up a Facebook page in her memory called 'Chloe Wilkes - Little Angel Who's Now In Good Hands', and wrote on it: 'Night Wilkes, have a nice time up there won't ya! 'Will never forget ya and just thinking about our old childhood memories in the garden and toy room - funny times! Think I will dig out the old baby photos of us on the bouncy castle! 'Miss you loads, can't believe this is really happening.' Luke Payne wrote: 'RIP. Can't stop thinking about you. 'I miss you so much, can't believe I won't ever see you again. I love u so much! You will never be forgotten.' Hayley Anne Powell wrote: 'Been thinking of you today, Chlo, just like every other day.  Still can't actually get my head round that you're now in a beautiful place called heaven and watching over us all. 'So sad and such a shock to many. 'I love you always our gorgeous angel you'll never be forgotten, not ever. You've got so much support and love behind you, your an amazing character. Keep resting peacefully princess. We all love you!  xxxx' Rhiannon Leah Hamilton wrote: 'This time last week my world fell beneath me. You are dearly missed, beautiful. 'It still hasn't sunk in. I hope you're okay up there baby! Sleep tight - love you and miss you always.' Group members have been selling candles and collecting donations to give to Chloe's family. Chloe was found collapsed at home on July 27 and taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford. The inquest into her death was opened in Folkestone, Kent and adjourned to a later date.

Melinda Kiss, of Long Island, New York, was told her name was too 'suggestive' by Facebook. She is pictured here with her husband Bob . 'I went to click enter,' Kiss told Business Insider in an email, 'and I couldn't. It was grayed out.' Then a notification from Facebook asked her to send them a copy of an approved ID, including a birth certificate, driver’s license, passport or marriage license. Mrs Kiss said she has been Melinda Kiss on Facebook for the past eight years. Kiss said she sent a copy of her driver’s license but Facebook has yet to change her name.

'My entire family is on Facebook,' she told Business Insider. 'Our name has never been a problem. It's just kind of funny.' Facebook has been plagued by issues relating to its filters. In June the social network changed its rules to allow users to post photos of breastfeeding. Following a major online campaign called #freethenipple, it has been revealed the social network changed ts policy - but has not explained why. Mothers took to the internet to complain after it was discovered breastfeeding photos were being banned. The social media giant has also had to deal with issues relating to hate speech, crude, violent, graphic and sexist content. This year Facebook has also been removing pages marketing paraphernalia associated with the extremist group Isis that is terrorising Iraq and Syria. 'Where hateful content is posted and reported, Facebook removes it and disables accounts of those responsible,' a Facebook spokesperson said last month.","Melinda Kiss, of Long Island, New York, married Bob on June 6 .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . The story of an exasperated New York Cosmos executive who, frustrated by the legendary Franz Beckenbauer's reluctance to stray from his defensive domain, remarked 'tell the Kraut to get his ass up front and score some goals', might possibly be the stuff of urban myth; a tall tale invented to mock America's ignorance of what they call soccer. The one about the American sports reporter who cried foul because the US had to play both Trindad and Tobago on the same day in World Cup qualifying, sadly, is not. That was in 1989 when Paul Caligiuri's goal in Port of Spain sent the US through to their first finals in 40 years. Optimistically they called it 'the shot heard round the world' but, in truth, there was little genuine interest even in their own country. The North American Soccer League had folded four years earlier, taking the star-studded Cosmos with it, and soccer faced a bleak future. Scroll down for videos... Crowded house: Over 100,000 people were in Michigan to watch Manchester United vs Real Madrid . Spark: The USA team's progress to the Last 16 of the 2014 World Cup has ignited interest in the sport . Support act: USA fans were among the most prevalent following their team in Brazil . A quarter of a century on, and it is a rather different scenario. This summer the US national team's progress in the World Cup in Brazil has sparked unprecedented interest among the American public, while English clubs have been beating a path Stateside like never before. Arsenal were here for the first time in 25 years and there is already talk of both Manchester clubs coming back next summer. A sell-out crowd of 109,000 watched United's game against Real Madrid in Michigan and despite the pitch problems City encountered in Minnesota, there is no doubting the club's belief in this most valuable of markets. City's American brand New York City FC will launch in the burgeoning Major League Soccer next year. They will soon be followed by a new Miami team owned by David Beckham, whose move to LA Galaxy in 2007 made the world sit up and take notice of MLS. 'It's not a promise any more, it's a reality,' says Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano. 'No matter how you look at it, soccer is the No.1 global sport and there is no reason for it not to be growing in the US – I think it's unstoppable.' 'Frank Lampard was telling me that only five years ago he could walk on the street in New York and nobody would recognise him. Now he can't.' Lampard and David Villa are New York's star signings. A third 'designated player' is allowed by a league still treading cautiously, anxious to avoid the lavish folly of the NASL. No-one is kidding themselves that Lampard and Villa would have considered coming here at the height of their careers. But the days when star players from Europe and South America – Pele, Beckenbauer and Best – could enjoy an easy pay-day at the end of their careers are in the past. Centre of attention: David Villa has become New York City FC's first ever signing . Friends reunited: Arsene Wenger greets former player Thierry Henry on Arsenal's first tour of the US . VIDEO Henry speaking before the daunting match vs Bayern Munich . 'All the players are well aware that this isn't a retirement league,' said New York City's director of football Claudio Reyna. 'In saying that, I'm waiting for some of these big players who want to come who aren't looking for the money. 'The business model of the old NASL didn't work and that's why the league collapsed. It wasn't sustainable. MLS has done a great job in making sure the league grows at the right pace. We need to continue to be mindful of our growth but we're ready to take the next step.' Progress has been built on the popularity of youth soccer, a football-mad Hispanic population (up from 14million in the days of the NASL to 55m now), and massively increased media coverage of the sport. Soccer is increasingly prominent on the television screens dotted around bars across America. Curiously, one in downtown Manhattan last week was showing a re-run of last season's Championship Playoff Final between QPR and Derby on the big screen. These days, almost every Premier League game can be watched live on the NBC Sports Network. 'It's like being locked in a candy store,' says veteran New York soccer writer Michael Lewis. 'There is no stopping the sport now. When the NASL went out of business, I feared it would be difficult for big-time soccer at that level to come back. I would never have predicted what we have here today.' We've come a long way: The sport has developed since Franz Beckenbauer played for the New York Cosmos . Next generation: Chelsea legend Frank Lampard will start his career in the MLS next season . Driven by an ambition to tap into the massively profitable US sports market, obligated by sponsorship deals like United's £355m partnership with car giant Chevrolet, and attracted by first-class sports facilities, nine Premier League clubs have played in America this summer. It's not only the soccer hotspots of LA, New York and Chicago either. The International Champions Cup brought City here to Minneapolis, Liverpool to Charlotte and United to Ann Arbor. Swansea City pitched up in Milwaukee and Blaine, Minnesota. As the last of them arrived home on Tuesday, they leave behind a country still dizzy on a World Cup high that saw Jurgen Klinsmann's team qualify from a group including Portugal, Ghana and Germany. They only lost by a single goal to the eventual world champions before going out with all guns blazing against Belgium, and afterwards President Barack Obama called captain Clint Dempsey and goalkeeper Tim Howard to offer his congratulations. Glove affair: Tim Howard's heroics against Belgium were even recognised by US president Barrack Obama . There is still much work to be done; many people to convince and convert. But it appears that football has finally established a foothold on the American sports landscape. Even the Cosmos are back, albeit in a reduced capacity. 'Soccer has grown in popularity and it exploded at the World Cup,' says MLS executive vice-president Dan Courtemanche. 'It captured the hearts and minds of the US public like never before. This is truly a rising soccer nation and it's ripe for MLS to take advantage. 'In the past, if the person next to me on a plane asked what I do, they would say, 'when will soccer make it in the US?'. This summer we passed that mark – that discussion won't take place in the future.' Big draw: Manchester United played Liverpool in the final of he International Champions Cup, Florida . US residents purchased 196,000 tickets for this summer’s World Cup before the tournament began. That was more than any other country apart from hosts Brazil, and more than England, Germany and France combined. Major League Soccer has grown from 10 teams in 2004 to 19 this season. Orlando and New York City will launch next year, Atlanta in 2017 and David Beckham’s Miami franchise will raise the total to 23. Of the current 19 teams, 15 play in stadiums built or renovated for soccer. MLS average attendance ranks third among America’s professional sports leagues behind the NFL and MLB, and ahead of the NBA and NHL. MLS has signed a new £330m eight-year television deal with Fox Sports, ESPN and Univision which is worth almost five times the current agreement with NBC. That is still dwarfed by the new £23.5billion deal the NFL has signed with US networks to show American football over the same period. Having failed to qualify for the World Cup for 40 years before 1990, the US has reached the last seven tournaments. Only Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Italy, South Korea and Spain have done the same.

"By . Mark Wilson . Bilel Mohsni was hit with a two-match ban for his bizarre diving headbutt on Scotland striker Chris Martin in the pre-season friendly at Derby. The French-Tunisian centre-back will sit out Monday's Petrofac Training Cup tie with Hibs at Ibrox and Sunday’s Championship opener against Hearts for his moment of madness in Saturday’s 2-0 defeat by the English Championship side. Rangers had been all but resigned to referee Mark Heywood including the astonishing red card in a formal report. That was promptly filed with the English FA, who immediately forwarded it to their disciplinary counterparts in Scotland. Mohsni’s dismissal in Derby was his third during 2014 and raised questions about his future at Rangers. Off you go: Bilel Mohsni was hit with a two-match ban for his bizarre diving headbutt on Derby's Chris Martin . However, Ally McCoist has no plans to offload him and will instead try to help the 27-year-old calm his destructive temper. The Rangers boss held talks with Mohsni on Sunday and insisted he wasn’t tempted to cash in after Abu Dhabi-based outfit Baniyas Sports Club saw an offer rejected earlier this summer. Speaking before the ban was confirmed, McCoist said: ‘I don’t think we are in a position to get rid of players who will definitely be big parts of our season unless there is an automatic replacement who is better. ‘We speak about Bilel’s downside but he and Lee McCulloch scored in the region of 30 goals for us last season. That is from centre-back, so it’s a reasonable return. ‘But there is a problem and it’s one we are working to resolve. It is something that Bilel has had throughout his career. He knows he would be a far better player if he can get rid of it. ‘Whether it is count to 10 or walk away, it is something he is going to have to do. ‘This is the third time he has been sent off (at Rangers). I thought he was unlucky with the first one against Airdrie last season, but the other two were just flashes where he lost it. I'm staying put! It is understood that Rangers boss Ally McCoist still wants to keep hold of his defender . ‘The upsetting thing is that he is a really nice boy, great with the kids and supporters. But there is that flaw within him.’ Asked if a psychologist could be enlisted, McCoist added: ‘I’m not sure. I’m not qualified enough in that department to know if that would work or if he’d want it. What I do know is that he accepts totally he was wrong and let the boys down. We want to work to eradicate that problem.’ Honduran midfielder Arnold Peralta will also be absent tonight after McCoist revealed he is currently stranded in Paris dealing with visa issues. Peralta was given extra time off this summer after he was forced to withdraw from his country’s World Cup squad with a thigh injury. ‘The mystery that is Arnold Peralta is definitely coming back — but when he is coming back, sadly, I can’t give you a definite on,’ added McCoist. ‘He has been in Paris trying to sort a visa and, if you are going to have problems, then I’d suggest Paris is the place to have them. ‘The good news is that Arnold is fit — the health issues are long gone. It’s just location issues now.’","Central defender was sent off in the defeat at Derby County on Saturday .

Garcia is poised to open talks with Andre Villas-Boas over a lucrative contract and City are happy to sell to balance their foreign quota. Manager Manuel Pellegrini is looking to trim his squad to meet the requirement that he selects from only 21 senior players in the Champions League. On his way? Manchester City midfielder Javi Garcia is wanted by Zenit and Napoli . City must have at least five English or English-trained players in their European squad.

Meanwhile, Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce reckons he saved Manchester City from going bust. Sacrificed: City are ready to let Garcia move on to balnce their foreign quota . Pearce says City were on the brink of bankruptcy during his time as their manager, and only the £21m sale of Shaun Wright-Phillips to Chelsea in 2005 saved them from going under. 'The club had sold the club shop, sold the ground to council, we were paying on the never and never for the Anelkas of this world,' he said. 'It really was a case that the owners said, 'Unless Wright-Phillips goes, we go.' On the Monday morning they pressed the button and Chelsea put £21million in the bank which bails the club out [but] which puts pressure on me because you are selling your goal-scorer.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Manchester City chief Ferran Soriano has revealed that the £32million deal to sign FC Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala will signal the end of their summer spending. Mangala’s arrival has been held up due to issues over third-party ownership but City hope to conclude protracted negotiations before next weekend’s Community Shield against Arsenal at Wembley. The 23-year-old Frenchman has already passed a medical and agreed personal terms, and his signing will take the club’s outlay on new players this summer to a relatively modest £50million following the purchase of his former Porto teammate Fernando, Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna and Malaga goalkeeper Willy Caballero.

He shoots, he scores! Manuel Pellegrini has added Fernando to the club's midfielder ranks from Porto . With the Premier League champions restricted to a £49m net spend for breaching UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations, Soriano confirmed yesterday that there would be no more new additions to Manuel Pellegrini’s squad. ‘We don’t plan season by season, we plan in cycles,’ he said. ‘We knew one year ago the positions we wanted to reinforce in the team and we did it. ‘We have a new right-back, a new holding midfielder and we will have a new central defender and that’s it. We don’t need to sign new players for the sake of it. ‘We need to sign the players that the team needs because the team has a balance. To win you need to keep the balance. Our squad is very strong and it’s the second year they play coached by Manuel Pellegrini so they’ll do much better.’ Pellegrini won the title in his first season in England after spending nearly £100m on Fernandinho, Alvaro Negredo, Stevan Jovetic and Jesus Navas last summer. The focus now will be on which players to offload as City look to trim their squad and comply with UEFA’s punishment. They are set to sell either Negredo or Javi Garcia to reduce the number of foreigners, while Micah Richards, Scott Sinclair and Jack Rodwell are all expected to go. Not done yet: Manuel Pellegrini confirmed that Manchester City's £32m move for Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala was not '100 per cent' completed . VIDEO Mangala seen in City video . On his way: Mangala has already undergone his medical at City and toured the club's facilities . City are also prepared to listen to offers for Matija Nastasic who will be pushed further down the pecking order once they have signed Mangala. With the France defender due to start pre-season training on Monday following his involvement at the World Cup, City want to tie up his transfer as soon as possible. Their remaining World Cup contingent – captain Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho, Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis – will report back to Carrington at the start of the week, although it is still unclear if Pellegrini and his squad will be back in England by then. Even if City beat Olympiacos in their last group game of the International Champions Cup in Minnesota today (sat), they face a three-and-a-half-hour wait to see if Liverpool can clinch top spot and a place in Monday’s final by overcoming AC Milan in Charlotte. The peculiar situation means the players will not know if they are flying to Manchester or Miami until later in the day. The Big Apple: Frank Lampard has become one of New York FC's first signings after leaving Chelsea . City are likely to be regular visitors to the US in future after launching their new franchise, New York City. Frank Lampard and David Villa have already been signed for the club’s debut season in Major League Soccer next year, and Soriano believes that City’s involvement was critical in persuading the two men to move to America. ‘One of reasons David Villa and Frank Lampard decided to come to New York is because they know who manages and who owns the club,’ he said. ‘We have some very bright star players, young players in Europe we might ask them to come to New York to play before they play at Manchester City. There are all sorts of advantages. ‘I think this will raise the bar for the whole league.

Woods is under severe pressure to deliver here to earn himself a place in the American Ryder Cup team. The sight of him scoring well once more at Firestone, where he has won no fewer than eight times in the past, must have gladdened Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson, on the day he lost the services of Dustin Johnson. VIDEO: Scroll down to see crazy chip and drive trick shot - nailed on the first attempt . Frustrated: but Tiger Woods is making progress as he battles back from injury . Steady start: Woods finished with a useful 68 in the first round in Akron, Ohio . ‘I’m a little frustrated that I didn’t take advantage of some great iron shots but I can see progress,’ said Woods. ‘This is only my seventh round back after surgery and I have to remember that.’ A huge crowd had gathered by mid-afternoon, as Woods made his way to the first tee. This was his first tournament since the worst 72 hole finish of his career in a major at The Open at Hoylake two weeks ago, as he seeks to make up for missing four months of the season following an operation on a herniated disc. It looked like he was in for another poor round when he opened with a careless bogey from the middle of the first fairway, but rebounded instantly with a birdie.

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai . Follow @@riathalsam . It took 72 minutes for Radamel Falcao to get on the pitch in the Emirates Cup curtain-raiser. After six months and one World Cup were wasted to injury, Monaco’s staff and supporters probably won’t mind waiting a little longer for a goal from their £53million striker. Their unease is more likely to centre on whether they see much more of him at all, with the Colombian reportedly close to a move to Real Madrid. That particular saga provided the main talking point before and during a 2-2 draw that occasionally thrilled but, more often, looked rather fittingly like a pre-season friendly. Return: Radamel Falcao featured in the second half as Monaco drew 2-2 with Valencia in the Emirates Cup . Lay off: The Colombian missed the World Cup through injury and has been linked with a move to Real Madrid . Bow: Falcao replaces Dimitar Berbatov in the 72nd minute of Monaco's draw with Valencia . Familiar faces: Ricardo Carvalho (left), who scored an own goal, and Berbatov (right) in action for Monaco . Valencia: Alvés; Barragán, Vezo, Otamendi, Cissokho; Parejo (Gil 70), Gomes (Guardado 70), Fuego; Feghouli (Piatti 46), Rodrigo (Alcacer 60), De Paul (Ibanez 60). Goals: Carvalho (og) 37, Alcacer 70. Monaco: Subasic; Fabinho (Bakayoko 80), Carvalho (Raggi 70), Abdennour, Kurzawa (Elderson 60); Toulalan (Dirar 60), Moutinho, Kondogbia (Carrasco 46); Martial (Ocampos 60), Berbatov (Falcao 72), Germain. Goals: Vezo (og) 20, Ocampos 80. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that the principality side in a financial bubble often looked so clueless against a Spanish club that has seen much better days. With Falcao on the bench, the mood in a largely empty Emirates Stadium was subdued, almost as if Monaco didn’t have £40m of talent in their midfield pairing of Joao Moutinho and Geoffrey Kondogbia. Sadly for those who did turn up, Monaco initially played as if they didn’t have them, either. For the first half an hour, before taking the lead, Monaco were ineffective. Within eight minutes, Valencia had them rattled, Dani Parejo releasing Antonio Barragan down the right, with the full back crossing to Rodrigo de Paul, who fired over. At the other end Dimitar Berbatov sauntered and flicked, touched and dipped. He even tracked a few runs and his backheel to find Valere Germain was typical. So was the booing each time the former Tottenham forward took possession. Valencia had another good opportunity after quarter of an hour when Andres Gomes side-stepped Fabinho on the left and crossed to the far post. Sofiane Feghouli, a fine player in this faded club, outjumped Aymen Abdennour but his pointblank header went straight at Danijel Subasic. On target: Paco Alcacer scores Valencia's second goal to give them the lead at the Emirates . Pat on the back: Alcacer  is congratulated by team-mate Andre Gomes (left) after his goal . On terms: Lucas Ocampos equalised 10 minutes from time to earn Monaco a draw . At that point Valencia were cruising; Monaco sightseeing. But with 30 minutes played Moutinho, a £22m man, made a telling contribution, delivering the corner that Abdennour glanced via a Ruben Vezo deflection beyond Aly Cissokho on the line. The lead was harsh, but it only lasted seven minutes. Ricardo Carvalho had the final touch, sliding and knocking into his own goal after Barragan swept in a low cross from the right. Rodrigo, once an unremarkable loan signing at Bolton but now one of the brightest players in Valencia’s side, came close with a flick and shot early in the second half. But Valencia were soon ahead when Paco Alcacer finished from close range after Aly Cissokho crossed from the left. Monaco levelled with 10 minutes remaining, substitute Lucas Ocampos taking position in Valencia’s half and running at Vezo. The defender offered a sight of goal and Ocampos drilled a low shot past Diego Alves from 20 yards.

Sunday 3 August: Arsenal v Monaco - 4.20pm . (All games are live on BT Sport 1) The Emirates Cup gets underway this weekend with Arsenal fans excited at the opportunity to see summer signing Alexis Sanchez in action for the first time. The Chile international isn't the only star attraction at the four-team tournament though that also features Monaco, Benfica and Valencia. Sportsmail previews the star men to watch for each team over the weekend. ARSENAL . Star man: Alexis Sanchez . Arsene Wenger finds himself in an unusual position of having concluded his major business early in the summer, with this tournament offering an early glimpse of what kind of potential he has amassed. The hope is that Sanchez will feature, with the broader wish among Arsenal’s support that he is, in fact, the missing piece of the puzzle. Wenger was positively beaming this week when he spoke about the qualities brought to the party by the £30million forward, usurped at Barcelona by Luis Suarez but welcomed like a kind of messiah at the Emirates. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Falcao nearly take his friend's head off playing baseball . Exciting signing: Alexis Sanchez is set to make his Arsenal debut at the weekend after his £30million move . ‘I love pace and when we lost Theo Walcott (to injury) we suffered a little bit on that front,’ said Wenger. ‘So I took him because he is a player who has the qualities of Walcott, he goes behind the defenders off the ball. ‘And with the quality of his runs he can be very important for us. I think he will give us an extra dimension, in terms of quality and threat. And I hope I’m right.’ Calum Chambers, who cost £12million from Southampton, is likely to battle with new arrival Mathieu Debuchy, a £10m signing from Newcastle, for the right-back slot, but David Ospina, so impressive at the World Cup with Columbia, has a thigh injury. Up for the challenge: Calum Chambers is set to rival Mathieu Debuchy for the right-back berth at Arsenal . MONACO . Star man: Radamel Falcao . With James Rodriguez sold to Real Madrid for north of £70m, Monaco lose a little bit of their allure. But in Joao Moutinho they have an excellent midfielder worth watching and, besides, they also have Radamel Falcao. The £53m Colombian is a magnificent talent and one who was so cruelly denied a place in the World Cup but a serious knee injury suffered in January. Predator: Falcao is one of the world's deadliest strikers and is a target for Real Madrid . The 28-year-old now appears likely to appear for Monaco against Valencia, for his first appearance in six months. Real Madrid will likely be watching as they plan a move to sign Falcao. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim told L'Equipe: ‘I think he will be able to start playing again at the Emirates Cup. He is now in the final phase of his recuperation.’ Another familiar face will be Dimitar Berbatov. Pastures new: Monaco will be without James Rodriguez who completed a move to Real in July . VALENCIA . Star man: Rodrigo . This is far from a vintage Valencia side, arriving in London on the back of a woeful season in which they finished eighth in La Liga and were trounced 3-0 at home by Swansea in the Europa League. Financially they found themselves in a bit of a mess. To London and Valencia travel with a new manager, Nuno Santo, a former goalkeeper at Porto under Jose Mourinho, and only modest hopes. Out to impress: Valencia's Rodrigo (left) will face parent club Benfica on Sunday having moved on loan . They have a genuine talent in the form of Rodrigo, who had an unremarkable loan spell at Bolton in 2010-11 but is a fine striker. A product of Real Madrid’s academy, the former Spain Under 21 player is on loan in Spain from Benfica. Valencia’s most recent pre-season results have a defeat on penalties to Peruvian side Alianza de Lima and a 3-1 loss to Nurnberg of the German second division. Star pedigree: Rodrigo (right) is a product of Real's academy and is a former Spain Under 21 international . BENFICA . Star man: Nicolas Gaitan . The form team of the competition come in on the back of an excellent season. They won a domestic treble and reached the final of the Europa League, where they lost on penalties against Seville. Jorge Jesus has built a solid side, with possibly the strongest point being Nicolas Gaitan on the left wing. Against Arsenal, he will likely come up against Calum Chambers or Mathieu Debuchy, both new signings at right back, and it will be a match-up worth watching. Baller: Nicolas Gaitan played a key role on the left wing as Benfica won a domestic treble last season . Gaitan didn’t make Argentina’s World Cup squad, but the 26-year-old was arguably Benfica’s finest player last season, lighting up the Taca de Portugal final and also drawing significant attention from Liverpool. Brazilian Lima has also proven himself as a prolific forward, while Oscar Cardozo, at 31, is still extremely effective despite a relatively tame 2013-14 season. Benfica drew huge strength from their defence last season with Luisao, their 33-year-old, producing one of his finest campaigns.

Manchester United's young guns are threatening to replicate the club's famous Class of '92 once again after beginning the Milk Cup with consecutive wins - including an 11-0 thrashing of Australian side Gold Coast Academy. The Red Devils Under 16s, who are competing in the tournament's Premier section against sides from all over the world, won the title last year and the current crop are well on their way to retaining the prestigious trophy following an unbeaten start in Northern Ireland. If successful, the Old Trafford youngsters would follow in the footsteps of David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Co, who got their hands on the same silverware back in 1991. VIDEO Scroll down for Class of '92 trailer with Beckham, Butt, Scholes, Giggs and Nevilles .

Too good: United's youngsters celebrate one their 11 goals against Australian side Gold Coast Academy . Talent: United's under-16 side, pictured here at the opening parade, have begun the Milk Cup with two wins . United need just a point to qualify for the Milk Cup semi-finals, leaving them just two games away from retaining their title. The 20 teams who finish outside of the top four positions after their opening three games will then be split into five sections - Globe, Vase, Bowl, Salver and Shield. They then face off in a series of semi-finals and finals to determine who wins each section. The other sides taking part are: Benfica, Newcastle, CSKA Moscow, Espanyol, Brentford, Cherry Orchard, Vendee, Partick Thistle, Ichifuna FC, Lusaka Academy, County Armagh, County Antrim, Club America, Chertanovo Academy, County Londonderry, County Down, County Tyrone, Otago, County Fermanagh, Goald Coast Academy, Craig Bellamy Foundation, OC Blues and Bohemians. The competition was established back in 1983, when eight sides from Ulster took part along with teams including Algeria, Motherwell and a side from La Roche-sur-Yon in France. The tournament grew quickly and was soon attracting professional teams from all over the world, with many keen to test their most talented youth players against those from other countries. It is now made up of four sections - Elite, Premier, Junior and Minor - which represent age groups from Under 19 to Under 13. Paul McGuinness' side began the defence of their crown with a comprehensive win against the Aussies, with Demetri Mitchell grabbing four goals in an attacking display which wouldn't have looked out of place had Fergie's fledglings managed it 23 years ago. That team, which also included Nicky Butt, Keith Gillespie and Robbie Savage, demolished rivals Liverpool 4-1 on their way to a 2-0 win against Scottish side Hearts in the final. United's current side, which includes highly-rated triallist Oscar Borg of West Ham, ran riot in their opening game and then followed it up with a comfortable 3-0 triumph over local side County Armagh.

Born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and brought up in Rochdale, he was part of the Milk Cup winning side last year. Academy advisor and United's former chief scout Les Kershaw says: 'He's a very, very good player and is one of them that I like because he has a strong personality.' Marcus Rashford . Age: 16 .

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . The problems continued to mount for US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson in the early stages of the US PGA Championship on Thursday, even though Tiger Woods was fit enough to take part. Just days after withdrawing from the final round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational with a back injury, Woods declared himself pain free after nine holes of practice on Wednesday and teed off at 8:35am local time alongside Phil Mickelson and Padraig Harrington. But fellow Americans Matt Kuchar and Jason Dufner were not so fortunate, with the world number six pulling out after suffering back spasms and defending US PGA champion Jason Dufner  aborting his  title defence after 10 holes because of a lingering neck injury. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tiger plays at the US PGA . Neck injury: Jason Dufner aborted his PGA Championship title defence after 10 holes . Withdrawn: Matt Kuchar has pulled out of the US PGA Championship with a back injury . Dustin Johnson had already declared himself unavailable for Watson's team to deal with 'personal challenges'. Kuchar, who has already sealed his place on the Ryder Cup team for Gleneagles, was replaced in the draw by first reserve John Huh, who teed off at 9:05am alongside major champions Louis Oosthuizen and Justin Rose. Dufner has been severely hampered by two bulging disks in his neck since April and was eight over par for the day, having triple-bogeyed the par-five 10th, when he decided to pull out of the year's final major. He shook hands with his playing partners, fellow American Keegan Bradley and South Korean Yang Yong-eun, who are both former PGA Championship winners, before leaving the course. 'I've been feeling pretty bad all week,' Dufner told reporters. 'I felt bad last week. I haven't made a birdie in 45 holes and I'm just not able to play golf right now. 'I don't need to be out here. I tried to do what I could to be able to compete some and give it a go, but it is just pointless.' English duo Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, both currently outside the automatic Ryder Cup qualifying places, were part of a six-strong group sharing the early lead on two under par, with Harrington one under, Mickelson level and Woods one over par. Mickelson's opening drive on the par-five 10th was so far left of the fairway that he feared it had gone out of bounds and hit a provisional ball, but the left-hander found it up against a fence and was able to eventually scramble a par. VIDEO Tiger plays and Garcia and Fowler to challenge McIlroy again . In action: Meanwhile Tiger Woods was fit enough to tee off on Thursday . Wince: The US superstar had been an injury doubt after suffering from a back problem last week . Woods narrowly missed from 20 feet there for birdie but failed to get up and down from just off the green on the 11th and had to save par from 20 yards short of the 12th after badly mis-hitting his approach. Mickelson had also dropped a shot on the 11th despite a typical recovery shot from way below the level of the green, but the five-time major winner and Harrington both birdied the 12th. Woods slammed his club into the ground after hitting his tee shot into the crowd on the par-three 14th, but bounced back from a bogey there by chipping in on the 16th for his first birdie of the day. At one over par he was four off the lead shared by five players including Westwood, who had followed a bogey on the 15th with birdies on the 17th and 18th to reach the turn in 33. Poulter remained two under after eight holes with former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie just a shot further back after following eight straight pars with a birdie on the 18th.

Now, at such a tender age, Williams has already won her first senior medal, a silver in the 200 metres at the Commonwealth Games. This girl doesn’t hang about. Williams has ‘pain is temporary’ and ‘victory is forever’ tattooed on her wrists, a reminder of the months she has spent trying to get back to her best.

Second place: Jodie nips in ahead of Bianca Williams who won bronze in the 200m final at Hampden . ‘I had doubts I would make it back,’ said Williams. ‘I was pretty much out for two years. I have had a hard time getting back and my confidence was massively knocked, so to come back here and get a medal in this kind of field is a massive confidence boost. I am just hoping I can continue this.’ Williams’ successful junior career, articulate manner and good looks earned her the nickname ‘Moneylegs’, but it was the sprinter’s calm intelligence that was worth its weight in gold on Thursday night. She passed two Jamaican athletes when she came off the bend and equalled the second-fastest time ever recorded by a British woman, 22.50sec, despite cold, damp conditions. Williams has achieved so much for one so young, but that proves there is surely still more to come.

"By . Paul Hirst . Sir Bobby Charlton is sure Louis van Gaal is the perfect man to right the wrongs of last year's woeful season for Manchester United. United are embarking on a new era with Van Gaal at the helm following David Moyes' disappointing 10-month spell in charge. Under the Scot, who was selected by Sir Alex Ferguson to succeed him, United endured their worst campaign in Premier League history, finishing seventh. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal closely supervising Manchester United training . Dutch of class: Louis van Gaal has been tipped to return Manchester United to the top . Van Gaal appears to be slowly putting United back on track. The Dutchman has enjoyed a successful pre-season tour so far, registering wins over Los Angeles Galaxy, Roma and Inter Milan. And off the pitch the players have responded well to his demands for unity, strength and commitment. 'It's marvellous. I am so pleased with the way it has turned out,' Charlton, the club's record goal scorer told MUTV. United have been quick to make their move in the transfer market this summer, sighing Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera last month for a combined fee of £55million. More signings are expected. The Moyes era began with a failed attempt to sign Herrera and his compatriot Cesc Fabregas. Charlton, a director at Old Trafford, concedes errors were made in Moyes' only year in charge. 'We struggled a little bit last year and maybe a few people made a few mistakes but I don't think we will make them now,' said the 76-year-old, who made 758 appearances for the club. 'Hopefully we will be well-served by a really clever man.' 'Clever man': Louis van Gaal lists United legend Bobby Charlton as one of his all-time favourite players . Of the failures of Moyes' reign, the biggest was his failure to qualify for the Champions League. Van Gaal believes his team have a chance to prove they still belong among the European elite on Saturday though when they face Real Madrid, who won their 10th Champions League trophy last term. United will play the Spanish giants on the outskirts of Detroit, where a record 109,000 crowd is expected at Michigan Stadium, more commonly known as the 'Big House' as it is the third-biggest sports arena in the world. A win will guarantee United a place in the International Champions Cup final - and Van Gaal thinks victory would also go some way to proving United are still a force to be reckoned with. Wining ways: Manchester United remain unbeaten on their pre-season tour of the United States . Reflecting on the three wins he has registered so far, the United boss said: 'We played against AS Roma, who were second in the Italian league, then against Inter Milan, who were third in the Italian league. 'Now we play Real Madrid and it is nice to play against such teams, so you can show you are at least equal.' Making Monday's final, and beating potential opponents Liverpool or Manchester City to take home a prize of 1 million US dollars (£600,000), would be a perfect way to round off what has been a successful tour for Van Gaal. After their exploits in the United States, Van Gaal will take his squad back to Manchester, where they play Valencia at Old Trafford before the season begins on August 16 against Swansea. Portugeezer: Cristiano Ronaldo could feature against his former club after returning to training with Real . Van Gaal has always been a fan of the English game and he is looking forward to experiencing his first taste of Premier League football. 'I have always looked to matches of England,' said Van Gaal, who lists Charlton and Nobby Stiles among his favourite United players. 'I like the atmosphere of the English games. 'To work for the biggest club in England and the world makes it more of a challenge for me.' Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, has stepped up his fitness work at Real Madrid's base in Los Angeles in the last few days and could feature against his old club.","Bobby Charlton has backed Louis van Gaal to turn Man United around .

"By . Derek Lawrenson In Valhalla . A summer that has belonged to Europe can reach another benchmark at the US PGA Championship this week. Never before have European golfers won three majors in a row but who would bet against Rory McIlroy or one of his gifted cohorts seizing the Wanamaker Trophy and completing a glorious triumvirate in the space of just nine weeks? It’s all rather ironic, of course, that it could happen here at Valhalla, the place where so many bathed with smiles now had faces that were tripping them up when they left the venue of the Ryder Cup in 2008. Now the scene of Europe’s greatest disappointment this century is set to be the place where they complete their summer of supremacy. VIDEO Scroll down to watch WGC Bridgestone  highlights . History: Rory McIlroy and his European team-mates are looking to win a third straight major for the continent . Trio: Europe have never won three majors in a row but they will look to do so at Valhalla this weekend . Driven: McIlroy has won three different majors - the first European to do so in the modern era . Disappointing: Valhalla was the scnee of Europe's loss of the 2008 Ryder Cup to the USA . Just look at all they have achieved since the nights went brighter. In May, Martin Kaymer won the flagship event on the PGA Tour and McIlroy the equivalent in Europe. In June, Kaymer won the US Open and Justin Rose the first of two big tournament victories in a row on either side of the Atlantic. Then, last month, the McIlroy era began at Royal Liverpool and continued with his stunning success at the Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday. The McIlroy era? Rory himself might be keen to play down such talk but not his mentor, Jack Nicklaus. Normally one to steer clear of hyperbole, even the great man couldn’t help himself. ‘Rory is so gifted he could win between 15 and 20 majors if that is what he decides he wants to do,’ he said. German efficiency: Martin Kaymer has won the Players Championship (left) and US Open (right) this year . Top of the world: McIlroy has won three tournaments already this year and is looking for a fourth . VIDEO WGC Bridgestone highlights . No wonder they say all the best things come in threes. McIlroy’s Open success meant he became the first European golfer in the modern era to win three different majors. Now he’s trying to win three events in a row to make it three European majors in succession. It’s an awesome task, of course, to win three successive tournaments, particularly when two of them are majors. Tiger Woods pulled it off in 2006 and Lee Trevino in 1971. But if anyone in this age can do it, it’s surely McIlroy, who has got his head down and is a man hell-bent on a mission. At a time when his driving, by common consent, is setting new standards, McIlroy finds himself on the longest par-71 course in major championship history. That’s going to have him licking his chops, isn’t it? The big thing for McIlroy is whether he can take advantage and hole the birdie putts, like he did at Hoylake and Firestone. If he can do that, then he’s certainly got the mental strength to complete this feat that comes around once in a generation. Joy: McIlroy clenches his first in celebration after winning the Open Championship last month . Yet so many Europeans are at the top of their games right now that the sternest opposition could well come from the men who will be standing by his side at Gleneagles next month. Rose and Sergio Garcia must have almost forgotten what it’s like not to be on a leaderboard. The former played well here in that Ryder Cup defeat six years ago, winning three points out of four including a singles success against Phil Mickelson. He’s also due a dose of fortune after getting the wrong end of the luck of the draw at The Open. Garcia played poorly at the 2008 Ryder Cup and is not a fan of the course. But let’s hope the man who has just finished runner-up for three events in a row can keep the negative thoughts at bay. Would anyone seriously begrudge him a major after the tumultuous journey he has been on; the countless near-misses against the likes of Padraig Harrington, and the despair he felt two years ago at the Masters when he said he wasn’t good enough to win one? There’s more, of course. Kaymer had a forgettable July after the highs in May and June but sounded like a man ready to return to his gold standard. Any other year and Graeme McDowell’s victory in the French Open in June and high finishes at The Open and the Bridgestone would be worthy of more comment. Glory? England's Justin Rose has won twice already this year and will look to add another in Valhalla . So close: Sergio Garcia has come within inches of winning several tournaments recently . What about two Europeans who have had quiet summers but who would be fearless if they were in contention? Will this be the week Henrik Stenson or Ian Poulter join the party? Contrast all this joy with the sense of despondency gripping the American game. Woods has somewhat miraculously shown up but to what end? Dustin Johnson is off somewhere trying to sort his life out and Jason Dufner is so troubled by a neck injury he had an epidural last week and wouldn’t be here if he wasn’t the defending champion. Perhaps Mickelson, who signed off from Firestone with a 62, can lift the gloom, but it must be Rickie Fowler, the one bright American spark this summer, who has the best chance. His majors record so far this year reads: tied fifth at the Masters, and tied second at the US Open and The Open. The man with the best chance of disturbing the European hegemony, however, might well be the man McIlroy has just usurped as world No 1. Australian Adam Scott, like Rose, was desperately unfortunate with his Open draw. He only finished five shots behind McIlroy at the end, all of which and more could be put down to the markedly harder conditions he played in. A marvellous summer then, one in which Scott and the leading Europeans have eclipsed the Americans to such an extent they’ve been locked out of the top five in the world rankings. A third successive major, and a notable feat in a summer full of them for European golf, has never looked more inviting.

"By . Associated Press . A college friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted Monday of impeding the investigation into the bombing which claimed the lives of three people and injured more than 250 others. Azamat Tazhayakov was charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy, with prosecutors saying he agreed with another friend's plan to remove Tsarnaev's backpack containing altered fireworks from his dorm room a few days after the 2013 bombing. His trial was the first stemming from the bombing, which killed three and injured more than 260 near the marathon's finish line. Tazhayakov's mother sobbed loudly and rocked in her seat as the jury announced the guilty verdicts, which it reached on the third day of deliberations. Watch Video Here: . Guilty: Azamat Tazhayakov, left, was convicted earlier this week of helping obstruct the investigation into Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tazhayakov, 20, faces a maximum 25-year prison sentence . Tazhayakov's lawyers argued that it was the other friend, Dias Kadyrbayev, who removed the items from the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth dorm room and then threw them away. Court sketch from May, 2014: A federal jury on Monday found a friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of obstructing the investigation into the 2013 attack . Prosecutors told the jury that both men shared in the decision to remove the items and get rid of them to protect Tsarnaev. Kadyrbayev faces a separate trial in September. 'They did it to protect their close friend,' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Siegmann . A third friend, Robel Phillipos, is charged with lying to investigators. During Tazhayakov's trial, FBI agents testified that Tazhayakov - a foreign student from the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan  - told them he and Kadyrbayev decided to take the backpack, fireworks and Tsarnaev's laptop computer hours after Kadyrbayev received a text message from Tsarnaev that said he could go to his dorm room and 'take what's there.' The items were removed hours after the FBI released photos and video of Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, and identified them as suspects in the bombing. But Tazhayakov's lawyer, Matthew . Myers, said his client was a naive college kid who was prosecuted . because he was a 'friend of the bomber.' Myers said Tazhayakov and . another friend, Robel Phillipos, sat passively watching a movie in . Tsarnaev's dorm room as Kadyrbayev took the backpack. Prosecutors alleged that Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers — Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev — before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev, “i think they got his brother” hours before the public knew. Prosecutors . acknowledged that Kadyrbayev is the one who actually threw away the . items taken from Tsarnaev's room, but they said Tazhayakov agreed with . the plan. Watch Video Here: . Visit to Manhattan: Kazakh exchange student Azamat Tazhayakov, was found guilty of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice for going to suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's room three days after the April 15, 2013 attack and removing a backpack containing empty fireworks shells . Remnants of terror: This undated law enforcement agency photo released by the U.S. Attorney's Office and presented as government evidence Friday, July 11, 2014, during the trial of Azamat Tazhayakov . One month before the bombing, the prosecution alleges that Tsarnaev met with his friends at a restaurant and told them how he could make a bomb and then spoke about martyrdom. 'It was good to die … as a martyr, as you would die with a smile on your face and go straight to heaven,' Tsarnaev told them, according to Siegmann. The backpack and . fireworks were later recovered in a New Bedford landfill.

He will be sentenced on October 16, U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock said. Kadyrbayev is awaiting trial on the same charges later this year, while Phillipos faces the lesser charge of lying to investigators.

Not so serious: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walks along the corridor in his dormitory laughing and joking with his friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, the day after the April, 2013, Boston Bombings . Recovered: This undated law enforcement agency photo released by the U.S. Attorney's Office and presented as government evidence Friday, July 11, 2014, during the trial of Azamat Tazhayakov in U.S. District Court in Boston, shows a backpack retrieved from a landfill in New Bedford, Massachusetts . During six days of testimony at U.S. District Court in Boston, jurors heard FBI agents testify that Tazhayakov told them he had been present when the items were removed and later watched as a garbage truck hauled away the backpack. They also saw a videotaped statement from Kadyrbayev's girlfriend saying that she told him to dispose of the backpack when she realized the FBI was hunting for Tsarnaev. Tazhayakov's attorneys had said their client never touched the backpack or laptop, contending that Kadyrbayev did so and later dropped the backpack into a dumpster. None of the three men were charged with playing any role in the largest mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001, which injured more than 260 people in addition to killing three. Tsarnaev is awaiting trial on charges that carry the death penalty. His older brother, Tamerlan, who prosecutors contend also played a key role in the attack, died following a gun battle with police several days after the bombing .","A jury found a friend of Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of obstruction of justice .

"By . Katy Winter . We are constantly having the virtues of the first meal of the day extolled to us. Yet the average Briton is spending juts six minutes and 15 seconds rushing through breakfast each morning, even though the majority (82 per cent) agree it’s the most important meal of the day. Busy lives and hectic work schedules have been blamed on an increasingly blasé attitude towards breakfast with a worrying portion of the population (15 per cent) forgetting to eat their morning fuel and a further 34 per cent not eating in the AM at all due to inconvenience. Many of us blame hectic schedules and busy lives for not having time for breakfast . Over a third of Brits (37 per cent) are choosing snooze over food admitting that they would rather have longer in bed than ‘waste’ time eating a good morning meal. Furthermore, nearly two thirds (64 per cent) of Brits highlighted that if they were able to make more time in the morning, they would be more inclined to make themselves a healthy breakfast. Breakfast is often cited as the most important meal of the day . It’s not all doom and gloom though, as those who do make the time for breakfast are more likely to do so whilst listening to music, with 86 per cent admitting that listening to music in the morning perked them up for the day ahead. Weekends see the nation take the most time out to enjoy breakfast, with a lengthy 13 minutes and 2 seconds spent around the breakfast table on Saturdays and Sundays. Pop music topped the genre chart as the number one morning mood lifter (60 per cent), with Pharrell Williams’ viral hit ‘Happy’ (25 per cent) named as the UK’s ultimate track to accompany breakfast. Commenting on the study, neuroscientist Dr. Jack Lewis, co-author of ‘Sort Your Brain Out’, noted: 'Music is one of the very best tools available to every one of us, enabling us to shift our brains into a different gear. Its mood-altering impacts are extremely well supported by decades’ worth of scientific research. Using music to get us into the habit of making a little extra time each morning to give our brains the right fuel to kick start our day can only be a good thing.' He continued: 'A nutritious breakfast is also brilliant for Brain-hacking, which refers to simple adjustments to our behaviour that get our brains working better. For instance, substituting traditional milk with a product like Oatly (a calcium enriched oat drink) reduces your intake of saturated fats. 'A simple brain hack like this helps you to avoid clogging up your blood vessels in the long run.' The British Dietetic Association says: 'Apart from providing energy (calories) to kick start your day, a healthy breakfast provides essential goodness or ‘nutrients’ that the body needs such as fibre, vitamins and iron. 'Research has shown that people who eat breakfast have more balanced diets than those who skip it, are less likely to be overweight, lose weight more successfully if overweight and have reduced risk of certain diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.'

"By . Daniel Mills . A spike in inquiries for tattoo removal has jumped 300 per cent . Young Australians are queuing up at cosmetic surgeries and forking out thousands of dollars to have regrettable tattoos inked on their skin removed. In Australia alone, new research has revealed a rise of more than 300 per cent in the number of inquiries from people looking to rid of the shameful marks inked on their bodies. A survey of tattooed Australians, conducted by the Cosmetic Physicians Society of Australasia, has found that at least one in four Australians over 20 have a tattoo, but a third of these people have indicated they regret that decision. The largest number of people opting to have a former partner's name, spelling mistake or other regrettable mark removed are aged between 20 and 30. CPSA spokesperson Catherine Porter said the results were a huge indication of the high number of Australians with tattoos that would rather be without them. A former partner's name and spelling mistakes are just a few of the types of reasons people op to get tattoos removed . “We know that over 25 per cent of the Australian adults aged 20 years and over have a tattoo,' she said. 'We also know that a growing number of these people have come to regret their decision.' She said some of the more common types of tattoos people have removed are names of a former partner and spelling mistakes. While she said it can take less than an hour to have the tattoo inked, the removal process is much longer and people need to consider the long-term repercussions of getting a tattoo. Angelina Jolie got the name of her former partner Billy Bob-Thornton removed from her arm using laser . Write caption here . It could take anywhere up to a year, or 10 or more laser sessions, and a cost of more $5000 for a person to have a tattoo removed. 'Like all things, getting a tattoo may seem like a good idea today, but tomorrow it may be regretted,' Ms Porter said. Tattoo sleeves are a popular choice of tattoo among men aged between 20 and 30 . 'A Friday night after party special, may end up costing more to remove than you anticipated at the time,' she said. The more complex and colourful the tattoo, the more difficult it is to remove, she said, as different types of lasers are needed to break down the vast range of coloured ink particles. The CPSA recommends that people seeking to remove tattoos, should consult a qualified aesthetic medical practitioner to ensure they are safely and effectively treated. Ms Porter said there are a number of rogue operators with unregulated lasers, tempting people into opting for a cheap removal which could ultimately leave with unwanted scarring., . 'CPSA strongly recommends patients consult a medical practitioner to ensure that they get safely treated by trained professionals, avoiding scaring and the creation of a boggy unhealing mass that was once a tattoo,' she said.

"By . Emily Andrews . Updated: . 07:56 EST, 8 February 2012 . A peer is suing Sotheby’s auction house for valuing a family heirloom at £35,000 – two years before it sold for almost ten times that amount. Lord Coleridge, a descendant of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, had long believed the gold chain dated back to Tudor times, but the London-based auction house said it was a more recent copy. The family duly sold it for £35,000 as they needed funds to prevent the sale of their ancestral home – but were horrified when the chain later sold for £313,250 at Christie’s, who confirmed it was a genuine artefact. Lord Coleridge later sold his ancestral home, the Chanter's House in Devon, to the same man who bought the artefact. Piece of the past: Sir Edward Montagu wearing the precious Coleridge Collar, a gold chain of office King Henry VIII is thought to have presented to him in Tudor times . Now Lord Coleridge, fifth Baron of Ottery St Mary in Devon, is suing Sotheby’s for an estimated £450,000 damages after accusing their valuer of being ‘careless’. The former Guards officer said he would not have sold it privately for £35,000 but for the ‘snap judgment’ in 2006 of the Sotheby’s expert, who said it was from the late 17th century. His counsel Joshua Munro told Judge Mark Pelling QC the collar heirloom was a gold chain worn by Lord Chief Justices down the years and dates back to the time of Henry VII. He said as the only surviving Tudor chain of office it was ‘a marvellous and beautiful’ object and had probably been presented to Sir Edward Montagu, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, by Henry VIII. Taking action: Lord Bill Coleridge with his daughter the honourable Tania Harcourt Cooze at the High Court today, where he is taking legal action against Sotherby's auction house . Sotheby’s maintains its valuation was correct and that ‘reasonable care and skill was used’. But in 2008 the rival auction house Christie’s sold it for £313,250. Prior to the sale other dealers were offering as much as £650,000 for private sales. Giving evidence at London’s High Court, old Etonian Lord Coleridge, 74, said of the collar: ‘I believed it was very valuable and thought it was worth at least £500,000. Coleridge collar: The Tudor chain, dated to 1546 or 1547, was sold by Christie's for £310,000 . ‘It was always in the back of my mind that I might have to sell it but we had it for a rainy day.’ The collar came into the Coleridge family through the second baron and was passed down from father and son to the current fifth baron. Mr Munro told the judge that a Sotheby’s expert was careless in not checking the gold content and investigating properly what the market would pay for the collar. The hearing continues, and is expected to last five days, .",'Coleridge Collar' was presented to Sir Edward Montagu by Henry VIII .
"By . Richard Spillett . Paramedic Richard Playford has been found guilty of misconduct after swearing at a patient last May . A paramedic has been found guilty of misconduct after he told a patient to 'shut the f**k up' before leaving him in the back of an ambulance. Richard Playford, 64, launched the tirade of abuse at a 25-year-old man who had dialled 999 complaining of crippling stomach pains. He then stormed out of the ambulance and was later found a mile away by shocked colleagues, a disciplinary hearing has heard. Playford, who worked for West Midlands Ambulance Service for 30 years, has now been found guilty of misconduct. He quit the ambulance service shortly after the complaint was made against him in May last year. But, despite the finding, Playford has been allowed to continue working in his new job at a private ambulance firm because a watchdog found he does not pose a risk to patients. During a hearing at the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) in London, the paramedic said he was diabetic and was feeling unwell during the incident in May last year. A panel of experts decided the paramedic's behaviour towards the man, called Patient A at the hearing, was 'inexplicable' and did amount to misconduct. In a written ruling, the HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee said: 'By his own account, Mr Playford became very frustrated with Patient A and told him to ""shut the f**k up"". 'Mr Playford left the ambulance, leaving (another paramedic) to deal with and treat Patient A. 'His behaviour fell well below the standards of behaviour expected of a registered paramedic and amounts to misconduct. 'His decision to walk away was irresponsible and put Patient A at risk of potential harm. His medical condition is not regarded as either an excuse for, or a cause of, his misconduct.' Sophie Lister, presenting the case for the HCPC, said Playford and fellow paramedic Raza Ahmed responded to a 999 call from the man, who was complaining of stomach pains on May 5 last year. She said the row erupted when the patient stopped answering Playford's questions and said he 'did not like his tone and attitude'. Scroll down for video . Playford worked for West Midlands Ambulance Service for 30 years but resigned after the incident. File photo . She added: 'Mr Playford said words to the effect of ""That is it, I have had enough, I'm off"" and exited the vehicle closing the door.' After he was tracked down by colleagues, he eventually returned to the ambulance and apologised for his behaviour. The patient made a formal complaint when he reached the hospital and also alleged that Playford attempted to physically remove him from the ambulance during the incident. The paramedic always denied this, insisting he was removing a blood pressure monitor, and the panel found the patient's claims were not proved. It was also alleged that Playford took the keys to the ambulance's drug safe when he walked off, meaning the patient could not be given further pain relief. Diabetic Playford told a standards panel he was feeling unwell at the time of the row . The panel also found that this claim could not be proved as no one was sure where the keys were at the time. Playford, who has type II diabetes, said his blood sugar was low on the day of the row and he had a headache. He said he has been assaulted and abused by people he was trying to help in the past but had never retaliated. The panel accepted that the low blood sugar was a contributing factor to his 'loss of control' but was no excuse for his actions. Divorcee Playford, from Birmingham, West Midlands, had retired from the service in November 2011 but returned to work in December 2012, shortly before the incident . The hearing was told that, since resigning last year, he has begun working for a private ambulance firm and now works transferring patients to and from hospital and assists at sporting events. Despite the finding of misconduct, he was allowed to remain a registered paramedic after the panel decided he was not a significant risk to patients in his new role. The ruling stated: 'The Panel considers that Mr Playford has demonstrated insight into his misconduct. He has taken appropriate steps to ensure, so far as it is possible to do so, that the misconduct will not be repeated.' It added: 'He is better able to control his blood sugar levels since his current employer permits him to take food and drink with him on duty and the intensity of his workload is reduced meaning that he is less often required to work for long periods without a break.' After the hearing, a spokeswoman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'West Midlands Ambulance Service can confirm that Paramedic Richard Playford was employed by the Trust when the incident occurred. 'Mr Playford resigned from his role with the Trust shortly after the incident and that resignation was accepted with immediate effect. 'Mr Playford hasn't been an employee of the Trust since late May 2013. 'The Trust always expects the highest level of care and professionalism from its staff and unfortunately that was not the case on this occasion.'

For both astonishing records Asha had to raise the weights 10cm off the ground for an agonising five seconds. The Iron Queen made her way into the Guinness Book of Records after setting the new records in a leisure centre in Leicester.","Lachyl Abdul Guseynov lifted 33kg of weights using his eye sockets .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Assistant coach Paul Farbrace was disappointed to see rain curtail England's bid to build a big lead over India at Old Trafford, but conceded it would have been dangerous to try and resume the match with conditions as they were. England had reached 237 for six and a first-innings lead of 85 over India when the players were forced off by a torrential downpour during the afternoon session on day two. Although the rain stopped, large amounts of water collected on the outfield and the groundstaff could not get the playing area sufficiently ready for the match to resume and play was abandoned for the day following an inspection at 5.40pm. Waterlogged: The downpour in Manchester left the Old Trafford outfield looking like a reservoir . Dark skies: The clouds stopped above Old Trafford and unleashed a rain storm down on to the outfield . Rain stops play: Assistant coach Paul Farbrace would have liked to see England build a big day two lead . That was frustrating for England and the crowd, but for Farbrace it was the right decision. Asked if it the conditions in the affected areas were dangerous for the players, Fabrace told Sky Sports 2: 'Of course it is. 'And the other thing is, I'm sure the Indians wouldn't be too keen to see the ball keep disappearing into that, getting wet and boggy. 'The umpires can't keep changing the ball every time it goes in there, and it would ruin the ball, the seam would become soft quickly, so I don't think either team would really be pleased with that. Delay: Joe Root (right) and Jos Buttler (left) leave the field after rain stopped play not long after lunch on Friday . 'It is a pity though because, so far, it's been a very good game. The pitch is fantastic, it's accelerated the game forward nicely and it was a good partnership developing between Butts (Jos Buttler) and Rooty (Joe Root) there, so we didn't really want to come off when we did come off to be fair.' Root was unbeaten on 48 when the players were forced off while Buttler, playing in his second Test, was 22 not out off 53 balls as he showed a different side to his game having hit a blistering 85 on debut. Farbrace said of the 23-year-old wicketkeeper: 'I thought he was very watchful. Jos showed today that he really can fight, get stuck in, he's a talented cricketer with so much to give. Their partnership was just starting to go in the right direction today. 'An 85 lead at this stage, I think we're in a quite a good position, but we want to bat on and get as a big a lead as we can tomorrow.' On top: Joe Root is unbeaten on 48 for England as they lead India by 85 runs with four wickets in hand . Jonny Bairstow clubbed a brilliant 123 but it proved to be in vain as England Lions fell short in their run chase against New Zealand A. The Yorkshire wicket-keeper was comfortably England's highest scorer as they were bowled out for 260 in their pursuit of 282, with only Jason Roy (42) offering a semblance of support in a 22-run defeat. It was harsh on Bairstow - one of England's match-winners when they beat Sri Lanka A in this triangular series on Wednesday - that when his 116-ball knock ended so did England's reply, but he could rest assured that he had done his bit, hitting 12 fours and two maximums along the way. Doug Bracewell and Matt Henry led the way in the bowling for the Kiwis, taking three each, as England consistently struggled - especially as they slumped to 48 for four. Dean Brownlie assumed the Bairstow role of comfortably leading the scoring for New Zealand, hitting 115 with the nearest highest scorer being Grant Elliott with 42. David Willey did his burgeoning reputation no harm with five wickets, although his economy rate of over six and over did not make such pleasant reading. Tom Smith also chipped in with a couple of wickets but the chase was always going to be a tough one for England. It proved to be that way too as Bairstow and Roy apart, the batsmen laboured, with six of them failing to make double figures. Openers Alex Hales and James Vince made just eight between them, while James Taylor and Willey also failed in the middle order. In vain: Jonny Baristow couldn't save England Lions from defeat at The Country Ground .","England's assistant coach says England didn't want to come off the field .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . His eyes are bruised, bloodshot and haunted. But this is just the start of the injuries inflicted on this British bodyguard after surviving a suicide bomb attack in Iraq. Former soldier David De Souza, 36, suffered a broken back, a severe head wound, and a brain hemorrhage that left him temporarily blind after he used his jeep to block the path of an assassin driving a truck laden with explosives while on protection duty in the war-torn country. Mr De Souza, who has guarded high-profile clients from former PM Gordon Brown to U.S. actress Tara Reid, has told how he is still struggling to recover from the physical and psychological scars left by his ordeal five years on. Survivor: David De Souza was left with a broken back and suffered a brain hemorrhage which left him temporarily blind after an attempted suicide bomb attack in Iraq . Aftermath: Mr De Souza's jeep was severely damaged by the blast in Iraq five years ago . The then bodyguard was accompanying a wealthy industrialist to a power plant as part of a three-vehicle escort when the suicide bomber attempted to ram their convoy with his truck. Mr De Souza, who was driving behind the car carrying the industrialist, accelerated to up to 100mph to block the Iraqi's path to his client and take the brunt of the explosion before swerving around his vehicle as the truck exploded in a ball of flame. The three-tonne Land Cruiser he was driving rolled over six times in the wake of the explosion - which left the bomber dead. He was airlifted to hospital by Black Hawk helicopter to be treated for his life-threatening injuries, before being flown back to Britain nine days later. Five years on, the father-of-two is still suffers with memory loss after the blast, and has not been able to work since. Mr De Souza, from Manchester, has now told how his training for a gruelling obstacle course in memory of his wife's late niece is helping him to rediscover his confidence and move on from the devastating explosion. Scars: Mr De Souza was left with a V-shaped wound to his head following the blast in Iraq . The brain hemorrhage Mr De Souza suffered after the explosion left him temporarily blind . Damage: Mr De Souza's Land Cruiser rolled six times after he accelerated to block the path of a suicide bomber . 'Because of my injuries, my reactions have slowed down and the brain damage I suffered has caused cognitive impairment and post-traumatic stress disorder,' said Mr De Souza, from Radcliffe, who is now father to Alfie, three, and three-month-old baby Archie with wife Lisa. 'One day when a car backfired I was on the ground shaking' David De Souza . 'I have a psychologist who is helping me, but one day when a car backfired I was on the ground shaking. 'And if it's a crowded street, I will panic and I have to slow down and take deep breaths and remember I am not in Iraq.' 'This course . has given me something to aim for,' said Mr De Souza, who said he still suffers 'catastrophic thinking' that leaves him imagining terrifying worst-case scenarios revolving around his wife and young children. 'A year ago I couldn’t run a mile but . now I can run eight miles,' he said. 'I have to stop in between but I am at my . fittest which has massively boosted my confidence.' Recovery: Mr De Souza, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, is now father to Alfie, three, and Archie, three months . Lisa De Souza quit her job as a hairdresser to take care of her husband when he returned from Iraq . Confidence boost: Mr De Souza is now training for a 12 mile obstacle course in memory of his wife's niece Maddie Rose Gooch . Mr De Souza, who protected high-profile clients including Gordon Brown and actress Tara Reid on visits to Iraq, still suffers from panic attacks and 'catastrophic thinking' as a result of the ordeal . David and Lisa De Souza on their wedding day at the Grand Canyon in Arizona, U.S. Mr De Souza served as a private in 23 Pioneer Regiment before training as an engineer. From 2004 he worked as a private security contractor in Iraq, protecting clients including former Prime Minister Gordon Brown as they visited the country to rally British troops. He had been involved in 10 other incidents involving gunfire attacks before the suicide attack on December 20, 2007. 'We got given a task to take a client to an American camp in Tikrit,' he said. 'Our vehicle tracking system was faulty and we had to replace it twice before it worked, so we all had an uneasy feeling about the whole job from the start. 'Although no one normally wore helmets over there due to the extreme heat - we all wore them that day.' David and his three-vehicle convoy negotiated various check points and got to within 20km of the venue when he saw the bomber's truck speeding in from the left. 'We had to protect the client who was in the middle vehicle,' he said. 'I was at the back and saw the bomber’s vehicle was coming from the left really fast. I moved onto that side to protect the client and take the brunt myself. 'I was doing 120kph because over there you have to drive fast in case you’re shot at by snipers. I swerved to avoid the vehicle because it wasn’t stopping and it exploded, causing my land cruiser, to roll six times. 'With all the equipment it is about a three tonne vehicle - really heavy. 'I landed in a ditch before being knocked out,' he said. On duty: Mr De Souza, seen left in Iraq, and right in Oman in 1993, served as a soldier before becoming a private security contractor . 'Panic': Mr De Souza said the sound of a car backfiring at home in Britain left him 'on the ground shaking' in the wake of the Iraq suicide bomb attack . Mr De Souza, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, is seen in Iraq, where he worked as a private security contractor . The then bodyguard, second right, with colleagues in Iraq . A colleague in Mr De Souza’s car suffered a punctured lung and a broken arm and leg after being thrown from the vehicle. Once back home hairdresser Lisa had to quit work to care for her husband as he battled back from his ordeal. He began training last year to build his fitness so he can take part in Tough Mudder, a 12-mile obstacle course in Malpas, Cheshire on Saturday November 17. All proceeds will go to the Alder Hey Hospital’s Imagine appeal, which raises money for research and equipment, in memory of Lisa’s niece who died at just 18 days old last year from an undetected heart problem. Mrs De Souza said: 'I’m so proud of David what he has achieved after what happened to him. 'When I went to meet him at Manchester Airport after he came home I thought ""this isn’t the man who went away"". He was shaking and he looked like the devil because his eyes were all red and bloodshot. 'To look at David now there’s nothing wrong with him, but it’s the cognitive side he has problems with. Everything has to be written down on post-it notes or he will forget.' 'He will think he has answered questions when he hasn’t and sometimes you will have a conversation and, within 20 minutes, you will be having the same conversation again. 'It was make or break when he came home from the accident but things happened so fast that we just got on with it,' she said.

"By . Ruth Styles . Despite food shortages in rural areas, reports of concentration camps and rising tensions between it and its neighbours, North Korea is a wonderful place to be - according to its rulers at least. Now the ridiculous nature of their claims has been laid bare by a series of Instagram videos created by Associated Press photojournalist, David Guttenfelder. From bleak country dwellings covered in peeling paint to a girl eating lunch under a television showing a military parade, it offers a rare look at the realities of life inside the Hermit Kingdom. Scroll down for video . Bleak: A desolate country road (left) and capital Pyongyang endures one of its regular power cuts (right) Military might: The North Korean army is omnipresent with parades and rallies a regular part of life . Guttenfelder, who has made 17 trips to the country since 2000, made the films during a visit in April when he was invited to witness a nuclear missile launch by the regime. Despite travelling with a government 'minder', Guttenfelder's images paint a shocking portrait of life inside the Communist country - one that is entirely at odds with the official version. '[North Korea] is an endlessly fascinating and visually surreal place, but it is also one of the hardest countries I have ever photographed,' writes Guttenfelder in a Huffington Post blog for the Associated Press. 'As one of the few international photographers with regular access to the country, I consider it a huge responsibility to show life there as accurately as I can.' Few foreigners, he adds, are allowed to leave the showpiece capital, Pyongyang, while the presence of minders makes getting photos of anything that doesn't toe the official line almost impossibly hard. Propaganda: Billboards pushing the 'Juche' way of life are seen everywhere in North Korea . Inescapable: The military is all pervasive even at a festival dedicated to 'Kimilsungia' and 'Kimjongilia' flowers . Grim: A girl eats under a TV showing more military might while in rural areas, people live in extreme poverty . That Guttenfelder has managed to get so many is an impressive feat, particularly as many reveal the all-pervasive influence of the country's military as well as a rare shot of guards patrolling the border with South Korea. Others show a surreal military conference where rows of identically dressed men clap perfectly in time, while others show grim Soviet style apartment blocks and equally grim looking soldiers standing guard beside the Unha-3 rocket at Sohae Satellite Station in Tongchang-ri. 'My window on North Korea is sometimes, quite literally, a window – of a hotel room, the backseat of a car, a train,' adds Guttenfelder. 'Fleeting moments of daily life present themselves suddenly, and they are opportunities to show a side of the country that is entirely at odds with the official portrait of marching troops and tightly coordinated pomp that the Pyongyang leadership presents to the world.' Desolate: North Korea's rural areas are utterly grim while the South Korean border is yet another military zone . Stalinist: North Korea calls itself a socialist utopia but in reality operates similarly to the former Soviet Union . The Korean War, which ended almost exactly 60 years ago on the 27th July 1953,  brought . the Kim dynasty to power and set the scene for decades of tension between it and . its southern neighbour. On the country's official website, . North Korean authorities describe the country as 'the Juche-oriented socialist . state which embodies the idea and leadership of Comrade Kim II Sung, the . founder of the Republic and the father of socialist Korea.' In reality, North Korea is home to . the world's last Stalinist regime and it shares many characteristics . with the former Soviet Union, not least a marked penchant for secrecy. More recently, the regime's pursuit of nuclear arms has brought it into conflict with Western powers - the United States in particular - while relations with its main ally, China, appear increasingly lukewarm. Currently, tension centres around the . Unha-3 rocket programme, which could, if developed further, eventually . develop a long enough range to make a strike on Los Angeles possible. While the country is yet to fire a missile in anger, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened the USA with a pre-emptive nuclear strike in March, describing the US as the 'sworn enemy of the Korean people.' The regime also pulled out of the 1953 armistice with South Korea and said they would end all mutual non-aggression pacts. Although the regime has since backtracked and has opened talks with its southern neighbour,  Japan increase its defence budget for . the first time in decades, while the USA has . threatened to defend itself if necessary. Truce: Then North Korean leader Kim Il-sung signs an armistice treaty to end the Korean War on 27th July 1953 .

"By . Martin Allen . Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. This week, Mad Dog talks about the first time he ever laid eyes on Raheem Sterling, how Robin van Persie should be the man to leave Manchester United and why he believes Rickie Lambert may be picked over Andy Carroll in England's World Cup squad. Four years ago on a cold, wet Saturday morning I stood next to David Pleat watching the QPR youth team play Brentford underneath the flight path into Heathrow. I was there to see my son Charlie play for Brentford. Potential: Raheem Sterling produced a stunning over-head kick when he was just 14 years old . International: He has already made his England debut and may get another opportunity this week . David told me he'd come to watch a young player and he pointed to a boy who was very small, very quick – with lightning acceleration – and very skilful. But he looked totally uninterested and during the game had no final product. Over the years we've all seen the super-quick boys at 14, 15 and 16 fade away. As other lads grow stronger and faster, those teenagers who used to be rapid just flitter away. Between David and myself we commented that he just looked average and was nothing special. At 0-0, with 10 minutes to go, David was about to leave when the boy, who was only about 14, was moved to centre forward. 184181 . 173825 . 131867 . 69591 . 69637 . 111340 . New generation: Sterling and young Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are England hopefuls . Lo and behold, the QPR right back bombed down the wing and got to the byline, from where he floated a cross beyond the near post defender towards the penalty spot. In an instant the boy changed . direction from the edge of the six yard box, running away from goal and . the monster Brentford centre back towards the penalty spot. As . the ball floated in the air the boy executed an astonishing over-head . kick that smashed into the stanchion in the back of the net. The . goalkeeper didn't even move an inch. Everyone who was watching clapped, including myself and David. It was sensational. We both looked at each other and smiled, and David took a note of the name. It was none other than Raheem Sterling. What a shame that Liverpool beat QPR to it and signed him. Lightning: The Liverpool winger has been a revelation since his reintroduction into the side . The . comments on Dutch TV by Robin van Persie that his team-mates are . getting in his way and going into his positions are typical of the Dutch . mentality that we've seen throughout their World Cup campaigns. We've . seen players getting sent home for disagreeing with the manager, . players getting sent home because they've complained they're not playing . and players getting sent home because they're not happy with the . bonuses. It's a very fine line between confidence and arrogance. Can you imagine Wayne Rooney's face when he read those comments? Clearly . Van Persie wants out. Aged 30 and with a poor injury record he's the . first one who should be shown the exit door in the summer. Quite . clearly that type of attitude rubs off on the rest and there will be . factions and cliques at Manchester United moaning and complaining, . talking about how Sir Alex Ferguson used to do it this way or that way. Anger: Robin van Persie must want to leave Manchester United after his recent comments . Beaten: Van Persie missed a simple chance to get Manchester United back into their Champions League tie . The bottom line is, several of those players are well past their best. Going . back two years, Sir Alex had to bring Paul Scholes, who was a . coach at the club, back from retirement as he was short of a holding . midfield player who could supply passes and control the tempo of the . game. Surely the alarm bells must've been ringing loud and clear when Scholes was in his late 30s and put back into the first team. Strikers: Wayne Rooney can't be happy with the way the Dutchman has been so outspoken . Roy Hodgson has a dilemma. Who does he pick as his 'big man' option as we get closer to the wonderful World Cup in Brazil? Rickie Lambert has been consistent, he's been steady and at times he has added the spectacular. This is a man who has ploughed and furrowed his way through lower leagues, through non-leagues, and finally made his mark as a top quality target man in the Barclays Premier League. I remember him well from just a few years ago, scoring for Bristol Rovers against my team at the time and basically putting another nail in my managerial coffin with that club. In the goals: Rickie Lambert has scored twice for England when they have played him . He was quality that day, he oozed confidence. He is an excellent technical finisher and as an England fan I think Lambert will get the nod over Andy Carroll. Andy undoubtedly has great qualities and Mr Hodgson would have to consider which player to choose if he were to have an impact substitute. This is where Carroll could sneak in. If you're 1-0 down with 20 minutes to go, I think Carroll could have a far greater impact. When defenders are tiring at the end of a match in hot conditions the last thing they want is a battering ram hurled at them. Roy's got a big decision to make. Up high: Andy Carroll is less subtle in his play but brings a more physical threat . Sunday . afternoon brought back, as it does every year, tears of sadness as I . sat watching the teams coming out at Wembley for the Capital One Cup final. I could only . shake my head remembering the 1986 League Cup Final – it was called the . Milk Cup back then – when I played for QPR against Oxford. We were near the top of the First Division, they were near the bottom. We'd beaten them away about three weeks before the final. Reminiscing: Watching the Capital One Cup final brought back memories of 1986 when Oxford beat QPR . And . in the semi-final we had beaten treble winners Liverpool over two legs, . including a 2-2 draw away at Anfield where thankfully Jim Beglin scored . two own goals and we didn't even have one shot. We were odds-on favourites. We had nice suits. We had the celebrations organised for a hotel in London after the game. It was a question of just turning up. We might as well not have done. I . think it's fair to say I was one of Oxford's best players; repeatedly . giving the ball away, not making any tackles, and the whole game just . drifted by. I found . myself substituted after 70 minutes and I'll never forget sitting on . that bench feeling empty, knowing I had blown it and let the supporters . and my family down. They hammered us 3-0 and that experience will never leave me. Trophy: Manchester City beat Sunderland 3-1 to claim their first silverware under Manuel Pellegrini . I was fortunate to be invited the London . Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square on Thursday night for the annual Sparks . fund-raising and awards dinner. They are a charity who fund medical research for children – it is a brilliant cause. On the night a huge £70,000 was raised, which is a fine effort. There . was a big charity auction with golf trips and holidays to Barbados on . offer and some prizes going for big sums to some very wealthy people. It was nice to do something away from football. There was a man from Armenia called Kevin, who played the piano, sang and joked around and had everybody in fits of laughter. He's the funniest entertainer I have ever seen. It was a wonderful evening.","The first time I saw Raheem Sterling he left his mark with an overhead kick .

"By . Ben Griffiths . Bonus: Stuart Gulliver is expected to receive a windfall of around £2million as part of a total pay and benefits package worth between £6million and £7million for 2012 . HSBC will hand its chief executive a huge bonus as it today posts one of the biggest profits in banking history. Stuart Gulliver is expected to receive a windfall of around £2million as part of a total pay and benefits package worth between £6million and £7million for 2012. Last week Royal Bank of Scotland, which is 82 per cent owned by taxpayers, announced it was paying bonuses totalling £600million – despite posting losses of £5.2billion. Downing Street caused controversy by praising the bank for its ‘responsibility and restraint’. Mr Gulliver’s handout is reward for HSBC notching up pre-tax profits of around £15.6billion, according to City estimates. That is just short of the bank’s record haul of £15.9billion in 2007 and would be the biggest profit by a British bank since the global financial crisis. Mr Gulliver’s bumper payout comes just months after the bank was slapped with a £1.25billion fine by US regulators following accusations it laundered billions of pounds for rogue states and drug cartels through its America division. HSBC was accused by the US Senate of fostering a ‘polluted culture’, ignoring warnings and breaching safeguards that could have prevented the laundering of money from Iran, Syria and Mexico. London-based banker David Bagley, head of HSBC’s compliance division, which is meant to prevent breaches of the law, sensationally quit in front of the Senate committee. He had been with the bank for 20 years. The US fine will have an impact on the company’s overall bonus pot, which is expected to be in the region of £2billion compared to the £2.8billion seen in 2011. Mr Gulliver would have been entitled to a total package worth £12.5million, including long-term share awards, but is likely to receive about half that sum. His bonus of £2million, which compares with £2.1million last year, will be deferred and subject to possible ‘clawback’, where he will not be able to cash it in until he retires from or leaves HSBC. Deborah Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre think-tank, said: ‘Banks should get their own house in order and ensure the internal culture has changed so that wrongdoing is stamped out before they think about paying bonuses of any kind to those in charge. HSBC clearly presided over a culture in the US with scant regard for the rules and little respect for compliance. Performance: Mr Gulliver's handout is reward for HSBC notching up pre-tax profits of around £15.6billion, according to City estimates. Pictured is the bank's headquarters, in Canary Wharf, London . ‘The buck for that has to stop at the chief executive’s door and if there is no penalty, what’s to stop it happening again.’ Despite being based in Canary Wharf, HSBC makes an estimated 90 per cent of its money outside Britain and has benefited from its presence in emerging markets in Asia. Since taking over as chief executive in 2011 Mr Gulliver has led an overhaul of the bank’s operations. He has cut about 10 per cent of its workforce and pulled out from 46 countries, as well as sold off a number of general insurance businesses. 'Banks should get their own house in . order and ensure the internal culture has changed so that wrongdoing is . stamped out before they think about paying bonuses of any kind to those . in charge' - Deborah Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre think-tank . Sky News also reported that HSBC will for the first time publish a single figure for the aggregate pay and benefits packages awarded to Mr Gulliver and his most senior colleagues. It is designed to show compliance with Government rules on disclosure that will come into force later this year. On Tuesday London-based Standard Chartered is also expected to cut its total bonus pot and the payout for its chief executive, Peter Sands. Despite a record trading year, the bank was also hit by a US regulatory probe into its dealings with Iran. According to Sky News, Standard Chartered will pay out around £930million in bonuses, down from £1.02billion a year earlier. Mr Sands will receive £2million compared with the £2.3million he was handed for 2011.","Bonus is reward for bank's estimated pre-tax profits of about £15.6bn .

"By . Associated Press . In the days and weeks since early May when his elderly parents were killed, Keith Dermond has been as puzzled as anyone else. Russell and Shirley Dermond had been married 62 years. Both in their late 80s, they fell prey to unspeakable violence in Georgia - savagery as the Putnam County sheriff has called it -- and whoever inflicted it seems to have left nary a trace. 'It just eats at you that somebody could do this and possibly get away with it. ... We don't even know the motive at this point,' their son Keith Dermond said by phone on Wednesday. Russell and Shirley Dermond, both in their late 80s, were found brutally murdered in their Georgia lake side home in May. Mr Dermond had been decapitated. Their killer has not been found . 'It's very hard to catch somebody when you don't even know their motive, and you don't know whether they would do it again.' Dermond, 55, who lives in north Florida, said his family is still sorting through his parents' belongings. 'It's really tough,' he said. As the investigation into the couple's death reached its three-month mark, Sheriff Howard Sills said the case still weighs on him. Sills said he rose at 4am the other day to make note of an investigative angle that came to him in the night. 'Myself and one detective continue to work on this every day,' the sheriff said. Investigators this week polygraphed someone who came forward with information that could prove fruitful, 'to see if they were truthful,' Sills said. On the sheriff's desk on Wednesday were 4,000-plus pages of documents related to the Dermond couple's finances. Russell Dermond, 88, had retired from corporate life -- much of it with clockmaking companies -- in the late 1980s to run a chain of Atlanta-area Hardee's restaurants. About 15 years ago, he and his wife, Shirley, 87, moved to Lake Oconee to live out their years in a golf-course community in a waterfront home. Sometime during the first weekend in May, they were killed. Russell Dermond was decapitated. Neighbors concerned they hadn't seen him found his body on May 6 in the garage of the Dermond's Carolyn Drive residence. The 3,200-square-foot, $1 million home sits in a tree-shrouded cul-de-sac in the Great Waters subdivision, a dozen or so miles northeast of Eatonton. Shirley Dermond's body didn't turn up until May 16. Fishermen found it in the lake, about five miles away by water. Autopsies showed that she and her husband died of head wounds, but exactly how they were killed is anyone's guess. Russell Dermond's decapitated body was found at the couple's $1million lake-front home on May 6 . One theory investigators are working on is that the killers reached the Dermonds' Georgia home via the 19,000-acre lake . The FBI and some Georgia sheriff's investigators have helped in the probe, poring over the case file. Sills recently called on the expertise of two detectives from the Jacksonville, Florida, sheriff's office's cold-case squad. Sills roomed with Jacksonville Sheriff John H. Rutherford when the two attended the FBI Academy. The Florida detectives spent a day and a half in Eatonton examining crime-scene photographs and other materials, Sills said. From the beginning of the investigation, authorities acknowledged that cracking the case might prove difficult. No one reported hearing any commotion. The Dermonds likely were dead three days before Russell Dermond's body was found. Video cameras at the guard house at the entrance to the subdivision weren't working. And it is possible the killer came by boat. The 19,000-acre lake offered countless entry and escape routes. While investigators for days scoured the Dermond house and areas around it for evidence, whatever they collected has yet to render a linchpin clue. And in the months since the killings, despite $55,000 in reward money, the flow of tips has all but dried up. Friends went to check on the elderly couple's home in May because they had failed to turn up for a Kentucky Derby party . Even the kooks have quit calling. 'Reluctantly, or regretfully I guess is the better word,' Sills said, 'I have to admit that things have slowed considerably. We are not getting any new calls. The reward is not seeming to initiate any information. ... We're not even getting the psychics.' Keith Dermond said he and his family -- the elder Dermonds had two other children, a younger son and daughter -- appreciate the locals who contributed to the reward fund. 'It shows how much they were loved around the community,' he said. 'We're just hoping that maybe that'll trigger something ... that somebody will come forward and spill the beans.' On Wednesday, he was unaware of any imminent developments in the case. 'Not that we're losing hope, but it gets tougher and tougher to believe that something's gonna happen here,' he said. 'I wouldn't say it's a cold case, but it's not looking too optimistic at this point. I'm sure the police and whatnot ... it's just driving them crazy.' Keith Dermond said he is confident Sills and other investigators are up to the task. 'We've heard from people around in the area that he certainly is somebody that is tenacious and won't give up. We're hoping that's true,' he said. 'It's a very infamous case at this point so, yeah, I'm sure as far as his own reputation and everything else, they're doing everything they can to get it done.' He added that crime shows on television, the 'CSI' types, make the unsolved killing of his mother and father all the more frustrating. 'The techniques they have of uncovering evidence and stuff like that,' Keith Dermond said, 'it's almost hard to believe that somebody could be that good a criminal that they didn't leave behind anything.'","Russell and Shirley Dermond, who had been married 62 years, were found savagely murdered at their Georgia lakefront home .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Colorado woman who suffered from breast cancer died after injecting her tumor with an alternative therapy. The 61-year-old had been taking cesium supplements every day for a year. But it was her decision to crush up an oral tablet and inject it into her breast that led to her death. Tragic: A Colorado woman died after injecting her breast tumor with cesium as an alternative cancer therapy . Dangerous: The unnamed 61-year-old had been taking cesium pills, which are widely available in stores, for years. She died after injecting it into her tumor for the first time . New of the cause of the unnamed woman's death came in a new case study, reported Live Science on Tuesday. Cesium has been touted as a cancer therapy by alternative medicine proponents for years. Advocates of the treatment believe the cesium can increase the pH of acidic cancer cells, thereby slowing their growth. While the supplement may be readily purchased in health food stores, it is not without its risks. What's more, there is no scientific evidence that supports claims that cesium can treat cancer. After the woman and her husband injected the cesium into her breast, things took a tragic turn. 'Not long after, she started to feel sick,'Daniel Sessions, a toxicologist who treated the woman in Denver, told ABC News.'After a few hours, she went into cardiac arrest in front of her family and was rushed to the hospital.' The woman lost conciousness and never regained it. She was dead in ten days. According to Sessions, heart problems are a common effect seen in cesium use. The woman had taken the cesium at the suggestion of a nutritionist after refusing a biopsy on the tumor a year before her death. In addition to the high levels of cesium found in her system, the woman's death may have also been hastened by the advanced stage breast cancer, which had spread to her lymph nodes. While Sessions believes alternative therapies have a place in medicine, he warned that those products 'should not be thought of as benign or harmless.'

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Like reading a blitz, Johnny Manziel knew the questions about his off-field wildness were coming. So the Browns quarterback struck first. 'At the end of the day,' Manziel said, 'I've made some rookie mistakes.' On the eve of Cleveland's first training camp practice, Manziel offered some regret about his well-chronicled weekend partying over the past two months. But as he prepares to battle Brian Hoyer for a starting job, Manziel, 21, said he's in good standing with his bosses. Regrets: Cleveland Browns draft pick Johnny Manziel - pictured here earlier this month rolling a $20 note in a Las Vegas bathroom - has said he has made 'rookie mistakes' during the off-season . Day job: Cleveland Browns' Johnny . Manziel says he needs to do a better when it comes to acting like a professional . It's time to get to work. From here on, he's Johnny All About Football. 'There's some things that I wish I could've gone back and done a little differently,' Manziel said. 'But I'm continuing to move forward and trying to represent this organization in a positive manner and a positive light, so just very excited to be back in camp and it's football 24/7 and that's what I love doing. 'That's what I live for and it's what my job, so for me, I'm very excited to be back and can't wait to get this underway.' Manziel addressed his fraternity-guy-gone-wild behavior, which included photos of him hanging out poolside in Las Vegas with Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, swigging champagne on an inflatable swan pool raft in a Texas nightclub and a shot of him rolling a dollar bill in a bathroom. Manziel didn't say he'll change completely, but vowed to be focused on football going forward. Manziel opened his news conference by discussing his off-field exploits, saying he has spoken to Browns coach Mike Pettine and general manager Ray Farmer. Write caption here . Relaxed: Manziel is pictured at a Red Sox game with Colleen Crowley, an undergrad at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas . 'For me, my main thing is, people within this building, my teammates, the coaching staff, the higher-ups in this organization we've all been on the same page,' he said. 'We've all been good and very eager to be moving forward.' For weeks, the Browns downplayed Manziel's antics. But as his questionable conduct continued and after the startling photo surfaced of Manziel with the rolled-up bill, Pettine reached out to the 21-year-old while he was on vacation. 'I've talked about that with Coach Pettine,' Manziel said. 'I've talked about it with Farmer and the people I needed to talk about that with. Moving forward, they're good with everything. I've told them everything that I need to, and everything's been good.' While acknowledging he could have made better decisions, Manziel also defended his lifestyle. 'I don't think there's anything wrong with me going out and having a night life, having a social life,' he said. 'I mean I am 21-years-old and I do like going out and it was the offseason. It's free time for us and if I want to go out and hang out with my friends or go to nightclubs or do things like that then I think that's within my rights to be doing that.

'I think there's other guys throughout the league that are doing that and I'm not trying to compare myself to anybody else but I think that's within my rights to be doing that.' Manziel doesn't think his busy social calendar will hurt his chances to beat out Hoyer. 'I don't believe so,' he said. 'I think there are definitely things moving forward to help better act as a professional. At the same time, I'm still learning how to do that. I'm still getting used to this role, still getting used to this league, still getting used to being a pro football player. 'I'm not in college anymore. There's things I need to do better, and that's just part of being a professional. Hopefully with time and going through this season and as time goes on, I'll get better at doing that.' The former Texas A&M star enters his first camp as Cleveland's No. 2 quarterback behind Hoyer, who will get all the reps with Cleveland's starting offense during the first few days of camp. Cleveland Browns draft pick Johnny Manziel stretches during the Cleveland Browns rookie minicamp on May 17, 2014 at the Browns training facility in Berea, Ohio . Pettine, who earlier this week said he wants to name his starter ""pretty quickly"" believes Manziel enters camp well prepared to compete with Hoyer. The continuous controversy surrounding Manziel has somewhat overshadowed Hoyer, who has worked his way back after suffering a season-ending knee injury in his third start last season. The homegrown Hoyer is certain he'll hang on to his starting job and be behind center when the Browns open at Pittsburgh on Sept. 7. 'I'm confident I am that guy, but in the same sense I know if it comes down to the fact Johnny does beat me out I will have given everything I can and he will have totally earned it,' Hoyer said. 'That's what you want. All I ask is the opportunity and a chance to earn the job, and that's what I've been given. For me it's about going out every day and proving I can be that guy I believe I am.'","Rookie NFL quarterback Manziel enjoyed a summer of non-stop partying since signing with the .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Owen Labrie, 18, a recent graduate of St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, has been charged with sexually assaulting a 15-year-old freshman . A recent graduate of a prestigious New Hampshire boarding prep school has been charged with sexually assaulting a freshman as part of a student tradition in which seniors try to have sex with younger students. A police affidavit obtained by the Concord Monitor alleges 18-year-old Owen Labrie, of Tunbridge, Vermont, sexually assaulted a 15-year-old on campus two days before he graduated from St. Paul’s School in Concord June 1. Police say Labrie denied having sex with the girl. Results are still pending from a state lab, but the affidavit says a nurse reported observing a laceration consistent with forced intercourse. Labrie, who is due to attend Harvard in the fall, is set for arraignment September 15 on three felony counts of sexual assault and one count of using a computer to lure the girl. The police affidavit said St. Paul’s counselor Sandra Whelan contacted Concord police after hearing from the girl’s mother June 3. ‘Whalen informed me that there is a horrible tradition at the boarding school called the “senior salute” in which a senior emails a younger student regarding a “conquest” before they graduate,’ wrote Julie Curtin, a detective with the Concord police. According to the document, when Labrie initially sent his ‘senior salute’ to the girl, she declined to meet with him. She later told police that she was aware there was a contest going on among upper classmen to see how many girls they could ‘hook up’ with. Idyllic environment: The alleged rape took place in a secluded part of the 2,000-acre forested campus in June . Elite institution: Founded in 1856 as an Episcopal school, St Paul's tuition is currently at just over $50,000 a year . Labrie then went to a mutual male friend and asked him to ‘put in a good word’ for him with the freshman. ‘When she accepted Owen Labrie’s “senior salute,” her understanding was that it would be “just a hook up,” which to her meant kissing or making out and ‘that’s all,’ the affidavit said. During their encounter in a secluded area of the bucolic 2,000-acre campus, Labrie tried to remove the freshman’s underwear and began to have sex with her, and when the girl realized what was happening, she said ‘no’ twice and at pulled back in pain, the affidavit said. Founded in 1856 as an Episcopal school for boys, St Paul’s is only one of six fully residential high schools in the country with annual tuition of more than $50,000. The illustrious school, which boasts 18 dormitories, a 95,000-square-foot fitness center, an 8-lane indoor pool, two hockey rinks, squash and tennis courts and a 2,000-meter rowing course with boathouse, sits atop 2,000 forested acres of land once owned by St Paul’s founder, Boston Brahmin and physician George Cheyne Shattuck. Graduates of the famed boarding school have included President James Garfield's son; New York City Mayor John Lindsay; half a dozen senators or congressman, including former Massachusetts Senator and current Secretary of State John Kerry, as well as a Nobel laureate and three Pulitzer Prize winners. There are currently 548 students from 36 states and 25 countries are attend the venerated institution. ‘She stated she did not know that was going to happen and did not want that to happen,’ the detective wrote. ‘I asked her if there was ever any conversation where she said yes and she said there was not.’ After the alleged encounter, Labrie reached out to the 15-year-old on Facebook, cautioning her: 'for so many reasons we need to make sure people don't think the wrong thing. ‘I have to trust you’ve got my back and you make sure the right people know what’s actually up,’ he said in another message, insisting that the two never had sex together. However, in a conversation with a friend the 18-year-old allegedly admitted to having sex with the freshman and acknowledged that it was illegal because of her age. Labrie reportedly comes from a humble family and attended St Paul's, where the annual tuition is upward of $50,000, on a scholarship. While studying there, Labrie was a prefect in his dormitory and had signed an agreement to be a positive role model. According to the affidavit, the teen had received training in statutory rape and consensual sex. Mike Hirschfeld, rector of the 540-student St. Paul’s whose graduates included Secretary of State John Kerry and President James Garfield's son, wrote about Labrie’s arrest in a letter to parents this month. Famed graduates: President James Garfield (left) enrolled his son in St Paul's School, and Secretary of State John Kerry (right) is also an alumnus . Font of creativity: Writer Garry Trudeau, the creator of Doonesbury, also got his start at St Paul's . ‘When this matter was first brought to our attention by the young woman involved, we reported it to the authorities, as is our obligation, and we are cooperating fully with law enforcement,’ Hirschfeld wrote. ‘This situation has been alarming to me personally and to all adults here, in a community that values healthy relationships so highly.’ If convicted, Labrie could face prison time and be required to register as a sex offender. He is out on $15,000 bail. Speaking to Boston Globe, his attorney said there are facts surrounding the case that will cast it in a different light.","Owen Labrie 18, recent graduate of St Paul's School who is set to enter Harvard in the fall, charged with sexual assault of a female freshman .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Archaeologists in the Netherlands claim to have found the world’s oldest telescope. Dating back to the 17th century, it could predate any other telescope known to be in existence. The find was made during digging works for a railway tunnel in the city of Delft in South Holland. Astronomers in the Netherlands claim to have found the oldest working telsecope in the world. It will be on display in the city of Delft's Prinsenhof museum, which is being reopened by King Willem-Alexander on 23 May . The small, cylindrical tin tube doesn’t look like much at first glance. 1608 - German spectacle maker Hans Lipperhey’s patent application heralds the invention of the telescope. 1609 - Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei is the first to use a telescope for astronomy. 1670 - Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius creates a large refracting telescope that is 150 feet long and hangs from ropes on a pole. 1781 - Astronomer Sir William Herschel from Britain discovers Uranus with a hand-made reflecting telescope. 1897 - A 40-inch (one metre) telescope is built at Yerkes Observatory, Wisconsin. It remains the largest refracting telescope ever built. 1917 - The 100-inch (2.5 metres) Hooker telescope is built in California, and was later used in 1924 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble to determine that our Milky Way was just one of many galaxies. 1990 - Nasa launches the Hubble Space Telescope, which has since observed our universe in unprecedented detail. In fact, experts initially thought it might simply be a bullet chamber. But specialists from Museum Boerhaave in Leiden confirmed it is indeed a telescope, if a little rusty. It was not, however, the finest piece of work at the time. The lenses inside were found to be of poor quality with a lot of unevenness. Nonetheless the pocket-sized device, about four inches (10cm) long, could still magnify objects by up to five times. ‘Especially the frontmost glass is so primitive that it was hardly recognizable as a lens,' curator Tiemen Cocquyt of Boerhaven told NL Times. ‘But after cleaning, the telescope really works again.’ The discovery is significant as it comes from the Dutch Golden Age, a period during the 17th century when Dutch trade, science, military and art were the most prestigious in the world. In the early 17th century the city of Delft was apparently a well-known producer of lens viewers. However, . no telescopes are thought to have survived from that period - only some . from the second half of the century have been found. But this telescope, discovered in a submerged ditch, could be the oldest yet. The reason experts think it is from the first half of the century is that it is a primitive tin scope of unknown origin. By 1650, tin was no longer used for telescopes and much better glass was available. This suggests it was merely a gadget owned by an affluent citizen of Delft. ‘The . tin looks gilded in places, which points to the fact that it was a . serious and valuable instrument, only in a time when the technique was . not very advanced,’ said Cocquyt. The telescope, dating back to the first half of the 17th century is about four inches (10 centimetres) long and is made of tin. Although it has undergone rusting it is still able to magnify distant objects five times . The telescope was believed to have been invented by German spectacle maker Hans Lipperhey in 1608, but it was not used for astronomy until Galileo (artist's illustration shown) in 1609 .","A telescope dating back to the early 17th century has been found in Delft .

The clip, constructed by filming elaborate scenes made entirely of Lego, first shows a happy Arctic scene featuring polar bears and Inuit fisherman. But Shell-branded trucks and oil rigs soon arrive on the scene, bringing a dark tone to proceedings as wildlife and even people are gradually drowned in a tide of black sludge. Drowning in oil: The video shows an idyllic Arctic scene constructed entirely out of Lego, which is drowned in oil . In the background, a slower, poignant version of Everything Is Awesome, an upbeat song used in the smash-hit Lego movie, is played. The video is an attempt to mobilise support against Shell by making Lego drop their association with the oil company.

Greenpeace also launched a petition alongside the video, which has amassed around 320,000 signatures. In response to the campaign, a Lego spokesman told the Guardian that the company wants to make 'a positive impact' on the environment.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A woman who flew from San Jose to Los Angeles without a boarding pass and has made repeated attempts to sneak aboard flights was arrested again Thursday at Los Angeles International Airport after wandering through terminals without an airline ticket, authorities said. Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was taken into custody a day after a judge had ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a paid ticket, airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said. Hartman took a morning Flyaway shuttle bus from downtown's Union Station to the airport. Gannon said he had a feeling Hartman was going to come back to LAX without a valid ticket, so police had passed out fliers with pictures of her to airport police officers and staff. Scroll down for video . Busted: . Hartman has been repeatedly picked up at San Francisco Airport for . trespassing. She made it onto a plane one time - but was discovered . before it took off . 'She was seen wandering through several terminals today in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said. Hartman was arrested for violating terms of her 24-month probation, which was issued Wednesday after she pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering the city as a stowaway on an aircraft. When she left court, Hartman said she would never try to sneak onto a plane again. 'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to repeat,' she said. It was unclear what charges Hartman could face following Thursday's arrest. Los Angeles city attorney spokesman Frank Mateljan said officials plan to review the police report while she is in custody. A call to her attorney, Elsie Wanton, was not immediately returned. Hartman had recently left mental health treatment that she had been ordered to attend and said homelessness drove her to take 'desperate measures.' She said she feels safer being in airports than in the streets. Still smiling: Marilyn Hartman, 62, claimed she would never try to hop a plane again without a ticket - despite at least a half-dozen arrests for it this year alone . On Monday, . Hartman had tried at least three times to get to a plane before she . finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's . documents at Mineta San Jose International Airport, according to law . enforcement officials. They would speak only on condition of anonymity because the security breach is being investigated. Hartman then went through the electronic screening process before entering an airport terminal. Her boarding status was discovered once Southwest Airlines Flight 3785 landed in Los Angeles, the officials said. Her . breach of security caused federal officials and the airline to launch . investigations. It also prompted criticism of San Jose's airport in . light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in the wheel . well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived the arduous journey to . Maui. In . February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo . County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound . flights at the San Francisco International Airport on three separate . days. In . November 2010, Hartman made it as far as the airport baggage claim on . the Hawaiian island of Kauai before being arrested, the San Francisco . Chronicle reported. Hartman . told authorities in the past that she wanted to fly somewhere warm . because she had cancer, said Steve Wagstaffe, district attorney for San . Mateo County. Prosecutors in San Francisco has declined to press charges against her after a half-dozen arrests. Authorities say she is mentally ill . Hartman had cancer but has been in remission for several years, the Chronicle reported. Authorities placed Hartman in treatment for mental disorders in May but said she stopped attending last month. Wagstaffe said he had no plans to take any additional measures against her. 'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said. 'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.' After her arrest Monday night, the 62-year-old claimed her plane-hopping days were over - despite seven previous arrests. After . pleading no-contest to trespassing charges on Wednesday, Marilyn . Hartman told reporters that she's sorry she sneaked through a . Transportation Security Administration checkpoint and that it was a . 'very stupid' thing to do. Hartman, . who authorities say has a history of mental illness, has now been . arrested nine times for trespassing at airports this year. Outside the Los Angeles Airport Court on Wednesday, she was cherry, talkative and engaging - despite her dire circumstances. Hartman was only discovered when Southwest crew members counted the passengers left on the plane who were going to Phoenix, the final destination of the flight (stock image) She was released from jail with the $4.25 in change that she had been carrying and directed to a nearby homeless shelter. A . judge told her to stay away from airports. Court officials told her she . could take a bus back to San Francisco. She's hopeful she can easily . panhandle enough cash for a ticket. 'I think I've been on enough programs where people can recognize me. They might give me a dollar or two,' she told KNBC-TV. She . said Wednesday that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate . measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the . streets. Wagstaffe said Wednesday that . Hartman has no family and was never married. According to her blog, . found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the last few years. She claims she was fired from her job as a legal secretary after she reported her boss for corruption. Records . indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in . Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle . reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up . for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant. According . to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully . hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later . released without charge. In . May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International . Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she . stopped attending last month. Then . she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office . declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another . failed attempt. On . Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles . International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained . on board for the final destination to Phoenix. She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department. Hartman's . antics - which previously targeted San Francisco International Airport - . have made her something of a folk hero in the Bay Area. On her first attempt, on February 15, she sneaked through TSA security and boarded a plane bound for Hawaii. She managed to take a seat on the flight - but was caught when the passenger who paid for a ticket in the seat showed up. She told police at the time that she had cancer - a claim that has not been substantiated - and that she wanted to go someplace warm. A Go Fund Me page set up by sympathetic San Franciscans has raised nearly $1,300 toward sending her legally on a Hawaiian vacation. The San Jose Mercury News reports that Hartman sneaked past the TSA agents check boarding passes while a family was being screened on Monday night. She had tried three times to get past the checkpoint unsuccessfully before she made it through. She then got into the security line and was screened for weapons like all other passengers. Once in the terminal, she tried unsuccessfully to board several planes before she was able to get aboard the Southwest Flight to Los Angeles. Southwest, unlike many other major airlines, does not have assigned seats - which could explain how she wasn't discovered until the plane landed at LAX. This is the second high-profile security breach at Mineta San Jose International Airport this year. In April, a 15-year-old boy scaled a fence and sneaked into the wheel-well of a Maui-bound plane. Incredibly, he survived the freezing temperatures for five-and-a-half hours and landed safely in Hawaii.","Marilyn Jean Hartman was arrested Thursday at Los Angeles airport wandering through terminals .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A man linked to a gun used to kill a university police officer days after the Boston Marathon bombings told police he smoked marijuana every day because, in his words, 'my best friend was the bomber,' according to court documents. Stephen Silva was arrested on Monday on charges of heroin trafficking and possession of a handgun with an obliterated serial number. The same gun was used to kill MIT police Officer Sean Collier during a manhunt for the bombing suspects. Silva, 21, was a high school classmate and a close friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a suspect in the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260. Collier, 26, was ambushed several days later and shot multiple times in his car. Stephen Silva was arrested on Monday on charges of heroin trafficking and possession of a handgun with an obliterated serial number . Silva was arrested on marijuana charges at a train station in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood in November. According to court documents, after transit police found two bags of marijuana and a wad of $555 in cash in Silva's pockets, he repeatedly told them, 'I smoke a lot of weed every day because my best friend was the bomber.' George Hinson, who attended the Cambridge Rindge and Latin school with Silva, Silva's twin brother and Tsarnaev, said Silva's arrest came as a shock. 'He would not have given (Tsarnaev) the gun or hidden it if he knew he was a terrorist,' Hinson said. 'Tsarnaev probably gave him a different story. He probably just wanted to make sure his friend was protected.' Silva, 21, was a high school classmate and a close friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, while Officer Sean Collier, right, was ambushed several days after the Boston Marathon bombing and shot multiple times in his car . Hinson said Silva and his twin brother, Steven, both initially enrolled at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev went, but the twins eventually transferred to the UMass campus in Boston. 'Steven was the pretty boy. Stephen was sort of the laid-back one,' Hinson said. Cordelia van Heeckeren, who lives on the same floor of the high-rise apartment building in Cambridge where the Silva twins lived with their parents, said she was stunned when she saw FBI agents with hacksaws and other tools preparing to enter the Silvas' apartment on Monday. She said both twins seemed to have a regular group of friends and were generally well-behaved. 'According to news reports, law-enforcement officials say it is the same weapon that was used ...in the MIT officer Sean Collier shooting. However, this has not been charged in the indictment,' said Jonathan Shapiro, an attorney for Stephen . Silva. The court documents did not explain whether Silva believed his friend was the bomber because of news reports or through other knowledge. The gas station where a carjack victim escaped from Boston Marathon bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, sits across from the apartment building where Stephen Silva lived . They also did not elaborate on why he said he smoked marijuana because of what he believed was his friend's role in the bombing. According to the indictment, Silva received the gun in or around February 2013. It said the gun 'had the importer's and manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, and altered and had previously been shipped and transported in interstate and foreign commerce.' The gun was recovered in suburban Watertown after Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, allegedly shot at police and threw pipe bombs at them during the manhunt. Watertown police have said Tamerlan Tsarnaev fired the gun at them and then threw it at them when it ran out of bullets. The indictment also alleges that Silva conspired to distribute heroin this summer in the Boston area. He was ordered to remain in custody and a bail hearing was scheduled for Aug. 6. Guilty: Azamat Tazhayakov, left, was convicted earlier this week of helping obstruct the investigation into Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tazhayakov, 20, faces a maximum 25-year prison sentence . Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in the shootout with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escaped but was soon found, wounded and hiding in a boat dry-docked in a backyard in Watertown. He has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial in November. He faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. His lawyer, Miriam Conrad, declined to comment on Silva's statement to police in the marijuana case. Four other men have charged in the bombing investigation. On Monday, a federal jury found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of obstruction of justice and conspiracy for trying to protect Tsarnaev by agreeing with another friend, Dias Kadyrbayev, to get rid of a backpack and disable fireworks they took from his dorm room. Kadyrbayev is to be tried next month on the same charges. Robel Phillipos, who is charged with lying to investigators about being in the dorm room with Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov the night the items were taken, is to have a separate trial in September. Another friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Khairulluzon Matanov, is to be tried next year on charges that he lied to investigators about the extent of his friendship with Tamerlan Tsarnaev and the contact he had with both brothers in the days following the bombings.","Stephen Silva has been .

"By . Associated Press . U.S. Border Patrol officials said Wednesday that agents discovered a garage-sized hole through a steel fence that divides the United States and Mexico just east of Nogales, Arizona. The announcement was the second one this week about problems with the border fence. Sunday saw runoff from rainstorms knock down 60 feet of the rebar-reinforced steel fence just west of the Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry near Interstate 19 in Nogales. Scroll down for video . Cut right through: Suspected smugglers made a garage-sized hole in the steel barrier that divides the U.S. and Mexico. It was one of two incidents this past weekend that left parts of the fence down . One way or another: Officials say smugglers often attempt to cut holes in the fence that runs along the U.S.-Mexico border. They also try tossing things over and digging under the fence . That fence stood between 18 and 26 feet high and extended at least 7 feet underground. The hole in a section of the fence 1 ½ miles east of the Nogales city limits was discovered by agents on Saturday. The Border Patrol says it is working on repairs for both fences and has agents monitoring the areas. 'Smugglers often attempt to cut border fences; dig under them; climb over them; and even throw things over the fence,' Border Patrol spokeswoman Nicole Ballistrea said in a written statement. 'As the Tucson Sector continues to improve deterrence efforts along the border, smuggling organizations are finding it more difficult to move their illicit goods into the interior of the United States.  Fencing infrastructure gives Border Patrol agents the time they need to stop illegal cross-border activity.' The storms that caused the fencing to topple began Friday in Sonora, Mexico, and resumed Saturday night until Sunday morning, when debris from the Mexican side of the border traveled through a wash and piled up against the border fence. The fence was built in 2011. It is constantly monitored by agents because smugglers and others who attempt to cross illegally routinely try to breach or knock down parts of it. The Border Patrol says it does not keep track of fence breaches or attempted breaches, but it does have a special unit devoted to finding and destroying underground tunnels used to smuggle drugs. Whether it's cutting through steel fences with special tools or building long and elaborate tunnels, smugglers have no shortage of creative ways to try to bypass the law and sneak drugs into the U.S. More problems: The hole was the second discovered in a week after workers Sunday discovered a 60-foot section that had collapsed due to rainwater runoff along the same stretch . In 2012, suspected smugglers who tried to use ramps to drive an SUV over a 14-foot-tall border fence in southeast corner of California became stuck on top of the barrier. Border Patrol agents found the Jeep teetering atop the fence about five miles west of the Colorado River and the Arizona state line. The suspected smugglers fled. The Jeep was empty, but agents said they believe it was filled with contraband before it got stuck. Just last month, agents in Arizona spotted a truck made to look like it belonged to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a federal agency. The decals on the truck turned out to be fake. But the 3,200 pounds of marijuana in it were real. Collapse: The collapse occurred just west of the Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales, Arizona, Sundayafter severe storms in southern Arizona over the weekend .","Border patrol in Arizona discovered the hole over the weekend and announced the repairs Wednesday .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Treatment: Savannah Snodgrass, who is less than a year old, has a deadly tumour in the left temporal lobe of her brain . An insurance company pulled its funding for an eight-month old baby with cancer at the last minute, denying her treatment at a specialist hospital. Savannah Snodgrass, the daughter of an Army major who served in Iraq, was born with a deadly brain tumour, which was discovered by doctors in May. Since her condition was found, Savannah has been treated at the Texas Children's Hospital, and was scheduled for a complicated brain procedure. But Superior HealthPlan, which provides cover to mother Tessa Snodgrass and her family, then decided not to cover the surgery because the hospital was outside of its 'network'. They instead referred her to another facility in Austin, Texas. While Texas Children's hospital has a 90 per cent survival rate for the operation Savannah will undergo, her mother claims that the new facility's rate is just 47 per cent. Ms Snodgrass, a 38-year-old retired soldier, said she was 'shocked' at the change. She told FoxNews.com: 'I was absolutely stunned because they had been sending us to Texas Children's all this time.' 'It's rare for a tumor to be found in a child this young, it so clearly called for a neurosurgeon specialized in operating on babies - not just any surgeon. 'Would you accept less than a 50-50 survival rate when you can have almost 100 per cent?' Savannah's struggle started in March, when she started suffering seizures, at one point being hit by 15 in the space of a single day. The baby, then just four months old, was taken to specialists who identified the tumour in the left temporal lobe of her brain, which is responsible for speech, vision and other types of perception. Specialists at Texas Children's hospital then produced a plan for beating the cancer, scheduling several procedures for which, Ms Snodgrass claims, her insurers happily paid. The switch came last month when Ms Snodgrass was sent a letter which said Texas Children's was not part of her plan, and suggested a new provider. Dispute: She has been treated in a specialist hospital for months, but insurers Superior HealthPlan suddenly withdrew their support and tired to send her somewhere with a worse track record . Now Superior HealthPlan has insisted that the new provider will be just as good - despite the concerns of Ms Snodgrass. A statement from the company said: 'Paramount to Superior HealthPlan is helping our members achieve positive health outcomes. 'We are sensitive to the complex and timely concerns of this family and are actively working with them to ensure their daughter receives the highest quality of care... we are confident that our in-network providers have the expertise and resources to give each member the individual care they need.'","Savannah Snodgrass was diagnosed with cancer aged four months .
