"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras pleaded for calm Thursday after rising anger at Greece's right-wing Golden Dawn party exploded into violence in a working-class Athens suburb. ""This is not a time for internal fighting, nor for tension,"" Samaras said in the televised speech. ""Any political differences should be resolved through democratic dialogue, not fiery arguments, nor violence, no matter where it stems from."" On Wednesday, crowds protesting the earlier stabbing death of a popular anti-fascist figure in Keratsini -- allegedly at the hands a Golden Dawn supporter -- hurled rocks at police and burned trash bins outside their station. The clashes came despite police raids of Golden Dawn offices and the arrest of a 45-year-old party supporter who police say admitted killing Pavlos Fyssas, a well-known hip-hop artist with the stage name Killah P. Fyssas' death inflamed already growing concerns about the rising influence of Golden Dawn, an ultranationalist, anti-immigration party that has been linked to street violence and neo-Nazism. In 2012, the party rode a wave of dissatisfaction among some Greeks over internationally imposed austerity measures amid the country's deep financial crisis, winning 7% of the vote and gaining seats in parliament for the first time. Golden Dawn MP Ilias Kassidiaris denied his party's involvement in Fyssas' death, calling it a ""heinous crime."" He accused politicians of ""exploiting a tragic event to win votes and divide Greek society."" The singer's death has nevertheless led to renewed calls to ban Golden Dawn. Greek Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias described the killing as an ""abominable murder ... by an attacker who, according to his own statement, sympathizes with Golden Dawn, thus illustrating in the most obvious way the intentions of neo-Nazism."" Dendias said the government is looking to amend the country's criminal code to make it easier to prosecute political attacks and better define what constitutes an ""armed gang."" Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos, whose socialist Pasok party is part of the governing coalition, said Golden Dawn ""must be dealt with as a criminal organization."" And an Austrian member of the European Parliament, Hannes Swoboda, also urged lawmakers to ban the party . ""Golden Dawn's openly xenophobic, neo-Nazi hatred goes as far as murdering political opponents. This is shocking and intolerable by any standards, and more so in a European Union country,"" he said. In his speech Thursday, Samaras called Fyssas' death an ""inhuman assassination"" and said the government is ""determined to not allow the descendants of the Nazis to poison our social life, to commit crimes, terrorize and undermine the foundations of the country that gave birth to democracy.""","Prime minister calls for calm after clashes in an Athens suburb .

"(CNN) -- A ruling is expected in coming weeks from a three-judge appeals court panel in Pennsylvania that heard Jerry Sandusky's bid for a new trial Tuesday on charges he sexually assaulted 10 boys, spanning two decades. Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts, deemed a sexually violent predator, and is serving a 30- to 60-year state prison sentence. Sandusky's appeal centers around three arguments: That he didn't have enough time to prepare for trial, that those who accused him waited too long to report the abuse to police, and that the prosecutor at trial improperly referenced a television interview Sandusky did with Bob Costas just days after he was charged. Sandusky sentence doesn't bring instant justice . The attorney general's office argued that there was overwhelming and consistent evidence against the former Penn State linebacker coach. Eight victims and two eyewitnesses testified about his pattern of abuse. Almost all of the victims met Sandusky through his charity, The Second Mile, which he founded for troubled youth. Tuesday's hearing was held in Luzerne County. Sandusky's son, six others reach settlement with Penn State .","Sandusky was convicted of sexually assaulting boys and was sentenced to prison .

"(CNN) -- English football seems to be experiencing something of a time warp. Liverpool and Arsenal jostling for top spot, Manchester United languishing in mid-table. For 55 minutes of United's match at bottom club Sunderland on Saturday, it appeared that the English Premier League champion's worst start to a season in 24 years would continue. Before kickoff, Liverpool had welcomed back 1990's title-winning manager Kenny Dalglish to a non-executive board role by beating Crystal Palace 3-1 to regain first place -- at least until Arsenal's trip to West Brom on Sunday. Sunderland, still without a permanent manager to replace the sacked Paolo Di Canio, then took a shock fifth-minute lead as Craig Gardner capitalized on some inept United defending, with Nemanja Vidic inexplicably giving him the ball inside the penalty area. For new United manager David Moyes, it raised the prospect of a third successive league defeat -- which last happened to the Red Devils 12 years ago. But much like his predecessor Alex Ferguson's success in introducing young talent such as David Beckham in the 1990s, Moyes was rescued by an 18-year-old making his first EPL start. Adnan Januzaj, yet another Belgian starlet to make his mark in England's top flight, first leveled with a cool sidefoot effort 10 minutes after halftime as he burst into the box to collect Patrice Evra's low cross. The midfielder, born in Brussels to Kosovar-Albanian parents and who has thus far refused all Belgium international call-ups, then volleyed a sublime left-footed winner just after the hour mark. For Moyes, who gave United striker Wayne Rooney his debut when a 16-year-old at Everton, Januzaj has every chance of joining the club's long line of top stars. ""I remember giving Wayne his debut and Adnan is certainly that quality. He's a top, top player,"" the Scot said after the match. ""I would have played him two or three weeks ago but it didn't work. We just never quite got the opportunity for different reasons, and I thought today was the right time and it was hard to stop him. ""He's going to be a special talent and he showed he's got goals and ability. We will keep his feet on the ground."" The result left United in ninth place, six points behind the club's bitter rival Liverpool. For the Anfield Reds, this is the team's best start to a season since the advent of the EPL in 1992, with five wins from seven games. Dalglish's second stint as manager -- his first was the last time Liverpool won the title -- ended with the sack 17 months ago in the wake of mixed results and Luis Suarez's eight-match ban for racially abusing Evra. Brendan Rodgers struggled in his first season as the club legend's replacement, not helped by Suarez's 10-match ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. That suspension spilled over into this season, but the Uruguayan's subsequent return has not hindered Liverpool's impressive start to the campaign -- indeed he has come back with a bang, adding another goal to last weekend's double against Sunderland. His partnership with Daniel Sturridge continues to blossom, with the young England forward making it 2-0 against Palace with his sixth in the league and eighth overall. ""The two boys up front are as good as any in the league, so you know you're always going to be in with a chance with them two,"" Rodgers said. Veteran Steve Gerrard celebrated his 639th appearance for Liverpool -- putting him seventh on the club's all-time list -- with his 99th EPL goal, netting from the penalty spot before halftime. Palace boss Ian Holloway was aggrieved by that decision, with Dean Moxey's tug on Raheem Sterling appearing to be on the edge of the area, but had the small consolation of seeing his second-bottom side edge the second half thanks to a late header by record signing Dwight Gayle. Manchester City bounced back from the midweek Champions League lesson against Bayern Munich by moving up to third place with victory by the same 3-1 scoreline against Everton. On-loan Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku gave the home fans a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu as he put Everton ahead, with England goalkeeper Joe Hart again in question -- as he had twice been against European champion Bayern. But Spain striker Alvaro Negredo leveled and Sergio Aguero made it 2-1 on halftime, before the Argentine's 69th-minute penalty hit the post and cruelly bounced into the net off the head of goalkeeper Tim Howard. Aston Villa beat City last weekend, but this time could only draw 0-0 at promoted Hull in a result that left both sides comfortably mid-table. Fulham moved out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at Stoke thanks to a second-half goal from former Villa striker Darren Bent, who came on to replace the injured Dimitar Berbatov. Newcastle joined Villa and Manchester United on 10 points after winning 2-1 at promoted Cardiff, with both goals from on-loan French striker Loic Remy.","Adnan Januzaj helps Manchester United come from behind at Sunderland .

"(CNN) -- How do you like your sport? Blood, sweat, tears and a nailbiting finish, no doubt. But what about death? If it were highly likely at least one competitor would die during a race, would you still watch it on TV? Or place a bet on the outcome? And how different would your answer be if the athletes were not humans, but horses, asks animal welfare activists. Those uncomfortable questions are unlikely to deter the 600 million people in 140 countries tuning in on Saturday to watch the hardest -- and most spectacular -- horse race of its kind in the world; Britain's Grand National. Each year, around 40 thoroughbreds leap over 30 fences in a thrilling 10-minute dash, with more than $300 million bet on the race in the UK alone. Part of the Grand National's huge appeal is the difficult and unpredictable 7.24 kilometer course. But with that difficult and unpredictable course comes a cost -- in the last 50 years of the race, 36 horses have died before crossing the finish line. For animal rights campaigners, the competition is viewed as a cruel death trap. For organizers, and indeed the 70,000 punters attending each year, it's the country's biggest, brightest sporting event. ""If you totally nullify the risk of the course, then you also nullify any element of challenge -- and the Grand National is the ultimate challenge,"" David Williams, spokesman at betting agency Ladbrokes, told CNN. ""Each of us has to look into our own souls and ask ourselves if that risk is a price we're willing to pay, and that's not an easy answer."" Rich betting tradition . From schools, to offices, and local pubs across the country, the Grand National sweepstake -- in which everyone is allocated a horse to bet on -- is an annual fixture. ""It is the biggest betting event of the entire year. It's a very British tradition,"" Williams said. ""Children are brought up with it. I remember watching it with my grandparents and betting with matchsticks."" Launched in 1839, the historic race holds a special place in the public's imagination, transcending the sports pages with its dramatic Aintree course and flamboyant Liverpool crowd. And despite two horses fracturing their legs and later being euthanized at last year's race -- including the favorite, Synchronized -- enthusiasm for the competition doesn't appear to be waning. ""The bottom line is, it hasn't had a significant impact at all,"" Williams said. ""The betting public don't appear to be particularly put off by the issue of horse welfare."" Death trap? Thoroughbreds usually die by falling on one of the fences, breaking a limb, and later being put down. Some also die from injuries during the race or heart attacks. ""Other jump races have uniform fences with a standard height of 4 foot 6 inches (1.4 meters),"" Dene Stansall, horse racing consultant at Animal Aid, told CNN. ""But at the Grand National each fence is a different height, style or slant. The ground might be lower or higher on the take-off or landing side and all these things throw the horse's center of gravity."" He said punters remained largely apathetic about horse deaths, continuing to bet in droves. ""A lot of people are very blase about it, they don't have any emotional interest other than monetary gain and the thrill of the race,"" he added. ""What you don't see on TV is the horse with a broken back or a bullet in its head. It's horrific to see an animal so desperate to keep up with the pack, struggling to get up on three legs with that one snapped leg just swinging round and round."" Or ultimate challenge? Aintree bosses have made safety improvements to the course in recent years, including moving the starting gate 100 yards away from the noisy crowd, and padding the fences with softer materials. ""We're working very hard to reduce injuries, but unfortunately you can never totally reduce risk,"" the race course's managing director, John Baker, told CNN. ""Horse deaths are part-and-parcel of life in general. A horse can get injured just as easily exercising in a field."" Qatar's six-star luxury hotel...for horses . Baker stressed how well cared-for the thoroughbreds were by dedicated teams of trainers, stablehands and jockeys. Similarly, jockey Katie Walsh, who finished third on Seabass last year, told London's Radio Times this week that the horses were looked-after ""better than some children"". Asked if he thought the public had been put off by nine horse deaths in the last 10 years, Baker pointed to the huge numbers still watching the race every year. ""Eleven million people watched it on the BBC last year -- more than the football, which is supposed to be our national sport,"" he said. ""It suggests that the Grand National remains extremely popular and there's no sign of that decreasing.""","Britain's most popular sporting event, The Grand National, will be run on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- A trial examining the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy headed to a judge Monday after attorneys delivered their closing arguments after nine weeks of testimony. The federal class-action lawsuit claims that police officers routinely stop minority men, particularly black and Latino men, without legal reasons. The police department says that the policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they consider suspicious -- is used to deter crime. The practice has been widely criticized. The lead plaintiff in the case is David Floyd, a medical student who was stopped twice, once in the middle of the afternoon when he was in front of his home in the Bronx, according to the suit, which was filed in 2008. Closing arguments Monday were marked by conflicting accounts of stop-and-frisk incidents. For example, while attorneys for the City of New York argued that one man was stopped because he appeared to be smoking marijuana, the plaintiffs' attorneys argued that he was simply talking on a cell phone. The Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit civil rights law practice, is arguing on behalf of the plaintiffs. Another man was reportedly stopped because he fit the description of a wanted man in a high-crime area with a recent string of burglaries, but the plaintiffs' attorneys argued that he was more than a mile from where the burglaries occurred and that the last burglary in that area occurred more than 25 days earlier. NYPD officers say they had stop-and-frisk quotas . Additionally, while city attorneys argued that many of those patted down gave their consent to the officers, the plaintiffs' lawyers countered by saying that none of the 12 witnesses who were stopped ever felt free to leave. Both sides argued that the accounts of events had changed since depositions were first taken. The nine weeks of testimony included secret recordings from officers; statements from 41 police officials and 12 witnesses; and expert opinions from criminal investigators. Testimonies included emotional accounts from men who say police stopped them for no reason and from police officers who say quotas forced them to make unnecessary stops. In the recordings, which were played in court by the plaintiffs' lawyers, supervising officers can be heard saying they want ""more 250s,"" referring to the form that officers fill out when they conduct a stop, question and frisk. City attorneys say that officers operate within the law, going where the crime is, and that crime happens to be higher in minority neighborhoods. During closing arguments, they contended that 88% of stops are justified and that there have been no legitimate indications of racial motivations. They argued that the plaintiffs' accounts of stop-and-frisk incidents were ""woefully lacking in substantive evidence"" and ""failed to show a single constitutional violation."" Rather than quotas, the attorneys claimed, the department used performance goals, which are legitimate management tools. ""We need to have performance goals to keep the city safe,"" said city attorney Heidi Grossman. Though 12 witnesses testified regarding a total of 19 stop-and-frisk incidents, city attorneys pointed out that in seven of the 19 stops, the officers could not be identified. NYPD report: Most are minorities . ""No real conclusions can be drawn when only half of the story is told,"" said Grossman. The lawsuit seeks to reform stop-and-frisk under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor. During their closing statements, the plaintiffs' attorneys argued that ""the NYPD believes that race is a proxy for reasonable suspicion."" According to plaintiffs' attorneys, the lawsuit is not about ending stop-and-frisk but examining how the police department conducts those stops and whether it stops blacks and Latinos in violation of the Constitution. Plaintiffs' attorney Gretchen Hoff Varner told the court that over the past eight years, blacks and Latinos constituted 85% of the people stopped, though 90% of those stopped were neither arrested nor given a court summons. Only 1% resulted in the recovery of a weapon and 0.14% resulted in the recovery of a gun. ""Clearly the NYPD isn't stopping the right people to get guns off the street,"" Hoff Varner said. However, Grossman noted that reasonable suspicion can still occur even if no gun is found. Plaintiffs' attorneys maintained that police officers feel pressure to stop and frisk to meet supervisor demands, which consequently results in the unlawful and unjustified stopping of New York City residents. ""They stopped first and invented reasons later,"" Hoff Varner said. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, the police department logged its 5 millionth stop-and-frisk under Mayor Michael Bloomberg in March. Attorneys will be given approximately three weeks to submit any additional paperwork. U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin did not specify when she expected to reach a decision, except that it would be ""prompt."" Changed outlined NYPD's 'stop, question, frisk' policy . CNN's Marina Carver contributed to this report.","Federal trial testing NYPD's ""stop-and-frisk"" policy hears closing arguments .
Plaintiffs say the policy fell disproportionately on black and Latino men .
The city says the policy helps to deter crime and is not racially biased .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's estate never gave an expert it hired permission to help AEG Live defend against the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and children, the estate's top lawyer said Thursday. The revelation raised questioned about the testimony of entertainment industry consultant Eric Briggs, who was hired by AEG Live to challenge the Jacksons' expert opinions concerning damages the concert promoter might owe if found liable in the singer's death. Briggs told the court this week that his company -- FTI Consultants -- had gotten a waiver from a Jackson estate lawyer before agreeing to work on the concert promoter's defense. Briggs had signed a confidentiality agreement with the Jackson estate in 2010 when he was hired to determine the value of its biggest asset -- the Sony-ATV music catalog that includes the Beatles songs -- for the estate's tax filings in 2010. He was hired by AEG Live lawyers in February to prepare a challenge of the opinion of an expert hired by the Jackson lawyers to calculate how much money the singer would have earned had he not died while working on his comeback concerts in 2009. Briggs said he -- or someone else in his company -- gained permission from the Jackson estate lawyer Jeryll Cohen to waive any potential conflict of interest. ""No one from the estate or any lawyers authorized or waived any potential conflict for FTI or Mr. Briggs,"" Jackson estate attorney Howard Weitzman wrote in an e-mail read in court Thursday. Such a waiver would be counter to the interests of the estate's beneficiaries -- Jackson's mother and three children, a Jackson lawyer said. Despite the conflict, the judge ordered Briggs to answer questions posed by Katherine Jackson's lawyers about the music catalog. He said although his valuation placed Jackson's interest in the catalog at about the same level as Jackson's debt at the time of his death -- which he said was $400 million -- the IRS challenged it as low. An independent analyst hired by the IRS concluded he had undervalued Jackson's interest in the catalog by up to $300 million, Briggs testified. Jackson lawyers argue it is evidence the singer was not broke when he died, contrary to what Briggs said in his testimony. Briggs testified this week that it was his opinion that it was speculative that Jackson would have earned a dime more in his life if he had not died of a propofol overdose on June 25, 2009. He based his opinion the testimony of a doctor who said earlier that he did not think Jackson would have lived even another week past that date. Panish, however, pointed out that the doctor's opinion was based on the assumption that Dr. Conrad Murray would still be giving Jackson nightly infusions of propofol -- the surgical anesthetic the coroner said killed him -- as a treatment for insomnia. The Jackson's suit contends AEG Live is liable because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray.","AEG Live's consultant testifies Michael Jackson's estate waived its conflict of interest .

"(CNN) -- How do the outer reaches of the sun get so hot? That's one of the questions that NASA has set out to answer by launching a new telescope that will stare into a mysterious zone between the sun's surface and outer atmosphere. Material that travels through the region, known as the solar chromosphere, heats up from about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius) at the sun's surface to temperatures as high as 3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit (2 million degrees celsius) farther out, according to NASA. The agency says its IRIS spacecraft, which reached its orbit Thursday evening after taking off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, will angle its telescope to study ""how solar material moves, gathers energy and heats up"" in the chromosphere on its way to the outer atmosphere, the corona. ""IRIS will show the solar chromosphere in more detail than has ever been observed before,"" Adrian Daw, deputy project scientist, said in a NASA article ahead of the launch. ""My opinion is that we are bound to see something we didn't expect to see."" What causes the corona's intense heat has been ""a scientific mystery for more than 50 years,"" according to NASA's Solar System Exploration unit. Information gathered by previous space missions suggests one source could be a magnetic field covering the sun's surface, the unit says. Scientists are also interested in the chromosphere because it generates most of the sun's ultraviolet rays that affect Earth's climate. The data gathered by IRIS, which stands for Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, will add to the work of two other missions that will monitor the sun's surface and outer atmosphere.","The IRIS spacecraft will point a telescope at a little-studied area of the sun .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council agreed Wednesday to send the Palestinian application for statehood to its admissions committee for review. The first meeting of that committee, which includes all 15 members of the council, is set for Friday. The debate is expected to be largely symbolic in the face of a promised U.S. veto. But the permanent observer of the Palestinian Authority to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, held out hope that the application would be accepted. ""As you see, the process is moving forward step by step, and we hope the Security Council (will) shoulder its responsibility and approve our application and send a recommendation to the General Assembly for the admission of Palestine into the United Nations,"" Mansour said Wednesday. He also sharply criticized Israel's approval Tuesday of the construction of 1,100 homes in a southern Jerusalem neighborhood that was seized by Israel in 1967. The Palestinians claim the land Israel occupied in East Jerusalem and the West Bank after the 1967 war as part of a future Palestinian state. Mansour said the settlements were ""1,100 answers of saying no"" to peace talks by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""This speaks clearly that Israel is not interested in negotiating with us."" But Israeli Ambassador Ron Prosor said it was the Palestinians who were trying to circumvent negotiations with their statehood campaign. ""We are not against a Palestinian state,"" he said. ""The thing is how to get there. We should be talking with each other, not over each other."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas made the bid for the United Nations to recognize an independent state of Palestine on Friday, a move Israel says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns. Abbas drew applause when he raised the document at the podium during his speech at the 66th annual session of the General Assembly. The time has come for a ""Palestinian Spring"" to join the Arab Spring in reshaping the Middle East, he said. ""My people desire to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humanity."" But Netanyahu, later taking his turn to address the General Assembly, said Palestinians are looking for a ""state without peace,"" ignoring security concerns important to Israel. He said Palestinians are armed not only with their ""hopes and dreams,"" a phrase Abbas had used in his speech, but with ""10,000 missiles, and Grad rockets supplied by Iran, not to mention the river of lethal weapons flowing into Gaza."" ""Palestinians should first make peace with Israel and then get their state,"" he said, adding that peace must arrive through a two-state solution that recognizes Israel as a Jewish state. If that occurs, Israel ""will be the first"" to recognize Palestinian statehood, the prime minister said. U.S. President Barack Obama has said he supports Palestinian statehood but reiterated a longstanding U.S. position that Israel must be part of the discussions. While a U.S. veto would block the bid for full U.N. membership, the General Assembly could still vote to upgrade the status of Palestinians, who currently hold the status of non-voting observer ""entity."" The body could change that status to permanent observer ""state,"" identical to the Vatican's standing at the United Nations.","The U.N.

"(CNN) -- Those deciding accused Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes' fate should expect the whole process to take eight months, a judge ruled Wednesday, suggesting -- while few question who is behind the massacre -- that other factors might prolong the case. District Court Judge Carlos Samour Jr. detailed his estimate in an order Wednesday pertaining to the questionnaire prospective jurors will have to fill out. Agreeing with the prosecution that it's better to overestimate than underestimate how long everything will take, Samour said jurors will be told jury selection could go on for two to three months. The actual trial will last four to five months more, he said. Other parts of the judge's order allude to what may be the biggest complicating factor in the trial: mental health, including the prospect of a person pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, as Holmes has done. At the defense's request, for exampe, one grouping of questions will fall under a ""mental health"" or ""mental illness"" subheading, ruled Samour. One question jurors will be asked: ""Do you have strong opinions -- good or bad -- about mental health providers?"" The burden is on the prosecution to prove that Holmes was sane at the time of the shootings. Jury selection in the case is expected to begin February 3, 2014, according to Colorado state courts spokesman Rob McCallum. About 400 moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, were settling into a July 2012 midnight showing of the latest Batman installment, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" when a man dressed head-to-toe in protective gear enters. Propping open the door, he exploded tear gas canisters in the theater, then began shooting, according to witnesses. Police say he used several weapons, including an AR-15 rifle, before fleeing the theater. It's there where the shooter was apprehended, identifying himself to police as ""The Joker,"" one of Batman's archenemies. Holmes faces 166 charges in the rampage, which left 12 people died and another 70 wounded. ""He didn't care who he killed,"" prosecutor Karen Pearson said last January, saying Holmes chose his venue carefully to cage his victims. ""He intended to kill them all."" Holmes was a neuroscience doctoral student at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus until the month before the attack; prosecutors have argued that he began plotting his attack while still enrolled. The defense, meanwhile, appears to be focused not so much on what Holmes allegedly did that night but his mental state then and earlier. A psychiatrist who treated him had warned campus police at the University of Colorado how dangerous he was, prompting them to deactivate his college ID to prevent him passing through any locked doors, according to court documents. CNN's Karan Olson contributed to this report.","Jury selection in James Holmes trial is set to start next February, court official says .

"(CNN) -- Al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda's brutal Somali affiliate, has claimed credit for the attack by multiple gunmen at an upscale shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya that has already killed at least 59 people. This should not be a surprise. For Al-Shabaab, the mall was an attractive target because Westerners, including Americans, frequented it. The mall is also in the capital of Kenya, a country that Al-Shabaab has good reason to dislike, as the Kenyan military played a major role in handing their forces a defeat last year when they liberated the key Somali port of Kismayo from their control. Al-Shabaab (""the Youth"") tweeted Saturday that ""all Muslims inside #Westgate"" -- referring to the mall that was attacked in Nairobi -- ""were escorted out by the Mujahideen before"" the armed assault commenced. Members of Al-Shabaab use Twitter frequently to communicate their messages to the world. The group has recruited around 40 young American men and also dozens from Europe and has shown that it is comfortable with Internet technology, despite the fact that Somalia is one of the poorest and most anarchic countries on the planet. Dozens killed, scores wounded, hostages taken . More than 10% of the Kenyan population is Muslim. So it is interesting that Shabaab took the precaution of evacuating Muslims from the Nairobi mall they were attacking, suggesting a greater sophistication in the tactics of this attack than the group has shown hitherto in Somalia, where they have killed large numbers of civilians indiscriminately in a country that is almost entirely Muslim. Before he was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs two years ago, even Osama bin Laden had scolded members of Al-Shabaab, telling them to try to avoid killing Muslim civilians. In a letter that was recovered in the house in Pakistan where bin Laden was killed, al-Qaeda's leader warned Shabaab members that they were killing too many civilians in battles in and around the key Bakara market in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Saturday's attack on the Nairobi mall seems to owe some of its tactics to Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistani terrorist group that attacked upscale hotels catering to Westerners in Mumbai, India, in November 2008 over the course of more than three days, killing 166 people. Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . In both the Nairobi and Mumbai attacks, a group of armed gunmen shot at civilians indiscriminately and conducted the operation in a manner that would guarantee sustained media coverage over many hours and even days by taking a large number of hostages. In both assaults, the gunmen did not negotiate for the release of hostages but went into the operation seemingly prepared for a fight to the death. Al-Shabaab has previously shown that it is capable of carrying out operations outside of Somalia, bombing two groups of fans watching the World Cup on television in Kampala, Uganda, on July 11, 2010, killing more than 70. The group seemed to have carried out that operation because Uganda had provided troops to a United Nations-authorized African Union mission then fighting Al-Shabaab in Somalia. The group has also shown an interest in targets in the West. Eight months before the attack in Uganda, a 28-year-old Somali man armed with a knife and an ax had forced himself into the home of Kurt Westergaard -- a Danish cartoonist who had depicted the Prophet Mohammed with a bomb in his turban -- and tried unsuccessfully to break into the panic room where Westergaard was hiding. Danish intelligence officials said the suspect had links with Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has managed to plant al-Qaeda-like ideas into the heads of even its American recruits. Shirwa Ahmed, an ethnic Somali, graduated from high school in Minneapolis in 2003, then worked pushing passengers in wheelchairs at the Minneapolis airport. During this period Ahmed was radicalized; the exact mechanisms of that radicalization are still murky, but in late 2007 he traveled to Somalia. About a year later, on October 29, 2008, Ahmed drove a truck loaded with explosives toward a government compound in Puntland, northern Somalia, blowing himself up and killing about 20 people, including United Nations peacekeeping troops and international humanitarian assistance workers. The FBI matched Ahmed's finger, recovered at the scene, to fingerprints already on file for him. Ahmed was the first American terrorist suicide attacker anywhere. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack . The attack on the Nairobi mall may be an attempt by Al-Shabaab to signal its continued relevance. Over the past three years, Al-Shabaab has lost substantial territory and influence in Somalia. Al-Shabaab controlled much of southern Somalia in 2010, but operations by African Union and Kenyan forces have ended its domination of southern Somalia. In 2011, the U.N.-sanctioned African Union mission partnered with Somali troops to fight Al-Shabaab militants, and in August of that year, African Union and Somali government forces defeated Al-Shabaab forces in Mogadishu, forcing the militants from a stronghold they had controlled since 2009. Although Al-Shabaab has long been regarded as a regional offshoot of al-Qaeda, its leaders only declared their formal ties to the international terror organization in February 2012. While the group seems to have been interested in an alliance before then, in 2010, bin Laden instructed the group's leaders to keep their association with al-Qaeda a secret, fearing that openly linking the groups would be bad for Al-Shabaab's fundraising efforts. By February 2012, however, bin Laden was dead and Al-Shabaab had suffered significant losses in its southern Somali safe haven. Al-Qaeda's new leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who had earlier petitioned bin Laden to reconsider his views about the proposed merger between Al-Shabaab and al-Qaeda, believed the time was right to announce formal ties between the two groups. While there are a number of American citizens fighting for a variety of al-Qaeda-affiliated or -inspired organizations, Al-Shabaab seems to boast the most American fighters. According to a 2011 report by the House Committee on Homeland Security, an estimated 40 Americans have joined Al-Shabaab in the last few years, at least 24 of them coming from the Somali community in Minnesota. Al-Shabaab has prominently featured these recruits in its propaganda operations, releasing three official videos that starred Abu Mansoor al-Amriki (""the father of Mansoor, the American""), who is actually Omar Hammami, in his late 20s from Alabama, who was raised as a Baptist and converted to Islam in high school. One of the videos shows Hammami preparing an ambush and features English rap lyrics extolling jihad. Hammami was reported to have been killed on September 12 during the course of some kind of an internal conflict within the Al-Shabaab group. The news of his death was confirmed on Hammami's Twitter account four days later.","For Al-Shabaab, the mall was an attractive target because Westerners frequented it .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration advised patients Friday to keep taking a popular cholesterol drug even though it might contain specks of glass, reversing advice it gave just a day ago. Millions of people take Ranbaxy Pharmaceutical's generic Lipitor, or atorvastatin, and many have been calling pharmacies confused about whether to take the drugs they have in their medicine cabinets. Ranbaxy initiated a recall November 9 and told pharmacies to stop dispensing the drug, but gave no advice to consumers about what to do with what was in their medicine cabinets. Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said the agency would review how it handles communication to the public during recalls. ""It took us some time to figure out what was going on,"" she said. ""We need to fix our process a little bit."" FDA: Stop taking recalled cholesterol drug . Between 3 million and 4 million people take Ranbaxy's atorvastatin, according to Ross Muken, senior managing director at ISI Group. The company has more than a 40% share of the generic Lipitor market. The FDA made no public statements on the recall until Thursday, when the agency said concerned patients should stop taking their medicine if their pharmacist confirmed it was from a recalled lot. After a conference call Friday afternoon with pharmacies and other groups, the agency decided to change their guidance. ""Yesterday's statement was poorly phrased,"" Woodcock said Friday. ""It made people think they should stop taking their medicine."" The glass particles are ""the size of a grain of sand,"" she added. The pills ""aren't of the quality we would expect of a drug, but they aren't risky, either,"" Woodcock said.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Walking into Cleveland, Ohio's Public Auditorium for the 27th annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony last night, it was hard to not think of the Titanic striking an iceberg on the very same day 100 years ago. In recent days Axl Rose and Rod Stewart, two of the biggest stars entering the Hall of Fame this year, pulled out of the show, making complete reunion performances by the Faces and Guns N' Roses impossible. Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante opted not to come, and the Beastie Boys' Adam Yauch stayed home as he continues to recover from cancer. One might think that these absences would sink the induction ceremony somewhere deep into the Atlantic Ocean, but it turns out they didn't matter much at all. In fact, it was one of the best Hall of Fame induction ceremonies in recent memory. ""I don't know that it matters who's here tonight, because it's about the music that these bands played,"" Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan said during his induction speech. Minutes after making that point, McKagan walked over across to the stage to play an explosive three-song set of Guns N' Roses songs with Slash, guitarist Gilby Clarke, Alter Bridge singer Myles Kennedy and drummers Matt Sorum and Steven Adler. Fans were screaming out ""F*** Axl"" through much of the night, but the moment the group launched into ""Mr. Brownstone,"" Rose and Izzy Stradlin's decision to not attend the ceremony was completely forgotten, and this previously unassembled lineup of the band proved they could revive the spirit of GNR on their own. Adler was grinning from ear-to-ear during a note-perfect ""Sweet Child O' Mine,"" and the finale of ""Paradise City"" had nearly every single person in the audience screaming at the top of their lungs. A powerful singer, Kennedy hit every Axl-patented banshee wail perfectly. The Faces also soldiered on without their lead singer, recruiting Simply Red's Mick Hucknall to fill his slot. He's done a bunch of shows with the group over the past few years, and he sounds exactly like early 1970s-era Rod Stewart. ""Ooh La La"" was a lot of fun, but they absolutely destroyed with ""Stay With Me."" Ron Wood played guitar with fiery passion, almost like he was trying to prove to Mick and Keith that he's in fighting shape for a Rolling Stones tour. Ian McLagan demonstrated that he's still one of the greatest keyboardists in rock and roll, and drummer Kenny Jones still has the chops that got him Keith Moon's old job in the late 1970s. Here's hoping that one day Rod comes to his senses and agrees to a tour with these guys. The Beastie Boys had no intention of performing without Adam Yauch, so the Roots were joined by Kid Rock and Travie McCoy of Gym Class Heroes for an incredible medley of Beastie classics, including ""Sabotage"" and ""So What'cha Want."" Rock, Black Thought and McCoy all wore matching green Adidas track suits, and they did a great job of channeling the energy and spirit of the groundbreaking trio. The evening kicked off with a surprise performance by Green Day, who did a bombastic rendition of the American Idiot deep cut ""Letterbomb."" Few in the audience seemed to know the song, but Billie Joe Armstrong worked the large room like a pro and got everyone pumped for the long night of music and speeches ahead of them. Per tradition, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame co-founder Jann Wenner addressed the crowd early on. ""I believe in the magic of rock and roll,"" he said. ""That magic can set you free. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight you've entered a place where magic happens."" Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill of ZZ Top delivered the first induction speech of the evening, honoring the late blues guitarist Freddie King. King's daughter, Wanda, spoke warmly about her father. ""He inspired so many young blues artists,"" she said. ""I remember going to a show when I was 14 and meeting Stevie Ray Vaughan for the first time. He said to my dad, 'How can I play the blues like you?' My dad said, 'If you don't feel the blues, you'll never play the blues.'"" After a smoking blues guitar battle by Gibbons, Joe Bonamassa and Derek Trucks on King songs ""Hideaway"" and ""Going Down,"" John Mellencamp came onstage to induct Donovan. ""He was my inspiration,"" Mellencamp said. ""I wouldn't just listen to Donovan. I would live Donovan, which means I was stealing all my s*** from Donovan. Other artists -- and you know who you guys are -- called that being inspired."" Donovan read a short poem, then played ""Catch the Wind"" and ""Sunshine Superman"" before duetting with Mellencamp on ""Season of the Witch."" Bette Midler broke down into tears near the end of her speech about Laura Nyro, who died of ovarian cancer in 1997. ""In a world full of imitators saying 'fake it till you make it,' she was a complete original,"" said Midler. ""She was in a league all her own. When you put her records on, you'd think they were made yesterday. She embodies what we all want to be, if only we had the guts...She was an ornament on the Earth. Everyone is so gratified to see this day finally come around at last."" Sara Bareilles then honored Nyro with a gorgeous take on ""Stoney End"" on the piano. Many non-performers were honored during the ceremony. Carole King inducted Don Kirshner, who was her boss and mentor during her days as a Brill Building songwriter in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Darlene Love honored the late record executive with an extremely powerful version of ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,"" which she sang with Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra. Later in the evening, Robbie Robertson presented the Award For Musical Excellence to Cosimo Matassa, Glyn Jones and Tom Dowd. In the middle of the evening, the Hall of Fame made up for some past oversights by having Smokey Robinson induct the Blue Caps (who backed Gene Vincent), the Comets (Bill Haley), the Crickets (Buddy Holly), the Famous Flames (James Brown), the Midnighters (Hank Ballard) and the Miracles, who backed Robinson for the first two decades of his career. The surviving members of all six groups took the stage together, and it was very moving to see these largely overlooked musicians finally getting the credit they deserved for their huge role in rock history. Public Enemy frontman Chuck D and LL Cool J teamed up to induct the Beastie Boys. ""They still are one of the greatest live acts in music,"" said Chuck D. ""They challenged the conventions in the music business and made up their own rules about what it means to be world class hip-hop cats...They always insisted (on) maturing as musicians and human beings."" LL Cool J said that he owes his entire career to the Beasties. ""I wouldn't be here today without them,"" he said. ""The Beastie Boys actually played my demo for Rick Rubin in his NYU dorm room. A lot of people don't know that."" Adam Horowitz read the audience a letter from Yauch. ""I'd like to dedicate this to my brothers Adam and Mike,"" he wrote. ""They walked the globe with me. It's also for anyone who has ever been touched by our band. This induction is as much ours as it is yours."" Green Day initially seemed like a slightly odd choice to induct Guns N' Roses, but Billie Joe Armstong spoke extremely eloquently about group. ""'Appetite For Destruction' is the greatest debut album of all time,"" he said. ""Every song hits hard on all emotion levels and takes you on a journey through the seedy underworld of Los Angeles in brutal sequence...The thing that set them apart from everybody else was guts, heart and soul. Most important, they told the truth."" Not a single member of Guns N' Roses mentioned Axl Rose by name in their speech. Matt Sorum gently teased Steven Adler for somehow managing to get fired from Guns N' Roses for a drug addiction, and Adler gave a surprisingly brief speech that culminated with him quoting ""We Are the Champions"" by Queen. Slash admitted that all the drama building up to the ceremony almost caused him to bail, but his wife ultimately talked him into attending. Keyboardist Dizzy Reed and guitarist Izzy Stradlin opted not to come. It was about 12:30 a.m. when Chris Rock stepped up to the podium to induct the Red Hot Chili Peppers. ""A lot of people are upset that Axl didn't come tonight,"" he said. ""But let's face it. Even if he was coming tonight, he wouldn't be here by now. Where the f*** is Axl?"" He went on to explain that he first saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers when he tried to see Grandmaster Flash in Philadelphia, but walked into the wrong club. ""My friends and I were like, 'What the f*** is this s***? There's a lot of white people in here,'"" Rock said. ""They came out and I couldn't understand a f****** word they said, and they had socks on their d****! I had never been to a white show before, so I thought all white groups put socks on their d****. Years later, they're one of the biggest groups in the world and getting inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They have black ties on their d**** tonight."" John Frusciante may have stayed home, but former drummers Jack Irons and Cliff Martinez were in the house. At 1:00 a.m., the group (with three drummers) did a three-song set of ""By the Way,"" ""The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie"" and ""Give It Away."" ""I haven't played with Cliff in 25 years!"" Flea said to the crowd. ""He's a beautiful man."" At the end of ""Give It Away,"" Anthony Kiedis invited everyone back to the stage. Slash, Ron Wood, Billie Joe Armstrong, Kenny Jones and even audience member George Clinton crammed onstage for a euphoric finale of Stevie Wonder's ""Higher Ground."" In typical Hall of Fame fashion, the jam was completely chaotic, but everyone in the house seemed to be having a great time. The five-and-a-half hour show wrapped up at 1:30 a.m., and as the crowd poured onto the Cleveland streets in search of their cars or an after party, not a single person was talking about Axl Rose. It turns out they didn't even need him. See the full article at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Duff McKagan played an explosive three-song set of Guns N' Roses songs with Slash .

"(CNN) -- North Carolina pastor Otoniel Recinos has been offering an unusual warning these days to members of his church: Don't drive in nearby Alamance County. It's not safe, he warns them, because of the sheriff's department. A two-year Justice Department investigation backs up what Recinos and other Latinos in the region say they've known for a long time: Traffic stops by Alamance County sheriff's deputies are sometimes part of a ""pattern of racial profiling"" aimed at searching for illegal immigrants, according to a statement this week by Thomas E. Perez, the assistant U.S. attorney general for the civil rights division. Sheriff Terry S. Johnson has used offensive language when talking to Spanish speakers, the statement said, describing them as ""Taco eaters."" Deputies were between four to 10 times more likely to stop Latino drivers for traffic violations than non-Latinos, the Justice Department said. Many of the stops took place at traffic checkpoints organized by deputies near Hispanic communities. Latinos were arrested for violations, while others got only warnings or citations, the department said. The Justice Department also said Hispanics who were jailed after their arrests were discriminated against because they were targeted for immigration status checks. Read the Justice Department letter of findings on this case (PDF) The pattern ""violates the Constitution and federal laws,"" triggering ripple effects that result in ""distrust between the police and the community,"" Perez's statement said. It also ""inhibits the reporting of crime and cooperation in criminal investigations."" The sheriff vehemently denies the allegations. ""I don't know where they got their information from,"" Johnson said when contacted by phone, ""but it's completely false."" Johnson said his attorney had advised him not to comment on the case. Related story: No papers, no fear, say protesters . After Sunday services at his Pentecostal Church of Jesus Christ, Power of God in Chapel Hill, Recinos, a 55-year-old pastor, gathers for refreshments and fellowship with his flock of about 50 people -- who are mostly Latino. ""I tell them not to go there unless it's an emergency,"" said Recinos, who came to the United States from his native El Salvador 22 years ago. Recinos' home is about 30 miles away from Chapel Hill in the Alamance County town of Burlington. After living there for nine years, the irony of telling his followers not to visit his own county isn't lost on him. ""That's hard, you know,"" he said. ""But you have to tell the people what you have to."" The situation is complicated by an agreement between federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities and the county sheriff's office. The agreement gave deputies additional powers aimed at identifying and arresting illegal immigrants for possible deportation to their home countries. The Justice accusations have prompted ICE to sever that partnership, said ICE spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez. The agreements, called 287(g) programs, have long troubled local immigration reform advocates. ""We applaud the feds for conducting the investigation and its findings,"" said Viridiana Martinez of the local advocacy group NC Dream Team. ""But there are still six other counties in the state that participate in the 287(g) program, which is at the bottom of this problem."" The programs have been a flash point in other states where immigration has become an issue. In Maricopa, Arizona, the sheriff's department saw its agreement with federal law enforcement revoked after the Justice Department also accused local authorities of discriminatory police practices. ICE also has terminated agreements with five other Arizona law agencies, including the Phoenix Police Department. Collaboration under 287(g) continues in 64 communities in 24 states. ICE also has information-sharing capabilities in more than 3,000 local agencies in all 50 states through a different program known as Secure Communities. Related story: Romney vows 'reasonable' immigration solution . Arizona's politically charged immigration law was partially upheld this month when a federal judge OK'd its so-called ""show me your papers"" provision. The section allows authorities, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of people who may be in the United States illegally. The Supreme Court in June tossed out most other controversial aspects of the tough new law. Related story: What's next in Arizona immigration battle? The Alamance County Sheriff 's Office shouldn't shoulder all the blame, said Martinez, the local activist. ""It's also the fault of the Obama administration for empowering these agencies to operate as immigration agencies,"" she said. To ""cut the problem at the root,"" she recommends ending all federal programs with local law enforcement that ""give them the power of federal agents."" The racial makeup of North Carolina is shifting, Martinez said, and ""a lot of white folks in the South are resistant to change."" In the past decades, North Carolina's Hispanic population has skyrocketed. Hispanics in Alamance County have increased by nearly 500 between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Census statistics also show that the number of Hispanic residents statewide grew by 943% between 1990 and 2010. North Carolina ranks 11th in overall Hispanic population, according to the bureau. But Martinez said Latinos who were first drawn by industry jobs in the region are now fleeing because the ""environment for immigrants in that county is horrible."" ""We know of people who have packed up after years and years of living there."" ""A lot of the Latino people are here to work,"" she said. ""They're not harming anyone -- but the last thing they want is to be arrested after they get pulled over."" In the wake of the federal accusations against the county sheriff's office, the Justice Department said that it ""will seek to obtain a court enforceable, comprehensive, written agreement remedying the violations."" Meanwhile, Recinos said he worries about his friends, family and his church members who look to him for guidance. He said his followers worry about being able to trust community law enforcement officers who are supposed to protect them. He said all he can do is tell them what may seem obvious in the wake of the Justice Department accusations. ""Be careful.""

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- U.S. satellite imagery has spotted ""vehicle activity"" at a North Korean ballistic missile site, two Defense Department officials said Friday. South Korean soldiers ride in armored vehicles during a drill Friday in the border city of Paju. This activity is similar to that before a long-range missile launch by North Korea earlier this year. It comes amid growing world concern over North Korea's latest nuclear test and test-firings of short-range missiles. Officials said the imagery shows vehicles used to transport Taepodong 2 missiles were spotted, but no missile parts were seen. The Taepodong 2 missile is a long-range missile that North Korea tested this year. North Korea test-fired a short-range missile Friday off the country's east coast, a South Korean military source said. It would be the sixth such missile test since the country conducted a nuclear test Monday. Also Friday, North Korea upbraided the U.N. Security Council for slamming its nuclear test, calling the members of the body ""hypocrites"" and warning of ""stronger self-defense countermeasures"" as the world body considers more sanctions against the country. ""There is a limit to our patience,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a combative statement.  Watch how the U.S. is responding to the latest launch » . North Korea blasted the Security Council's condemnations of the nuclear test on Monday and the launch in April of what North Korea called a satellite but other countries called a long-range missile. The North Korean actions are regarded as violations of Security Council Resolution 1718. Adopted in 2006 after North Korea conducted a nuclear test, the measure imposes sanctions Pyongyang and warns it should ""not conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic missile."" North Korea agreed in 2008 to scrap its nuclear weapons program -- which it said had produced enough plutonium for about seven bombs -- in exchange for economic aid. But the deal foundered over verification and disclosure issues. The Security Council has been working on a new and tougher resolution in response to the latest developments.  Watch Hillary Clinton's warning about ""consequences"" » . ""If the U.N. Security Council will make further provocative actions, this will inevitably lead to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's approach toward adopting stronger self-defensive counter-measures,"" the North Korean statement said. The statement said Resolution 1718 was ""fabricated"" by ""hypocrites."" ""The recent nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the 2,054th one on the Earth. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security council have conducted 99.99 percent of all the nuclear tests,"" the statement said. ""Those countries have posed the biggest nuclear threats to the world."" Noting that it's not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or the Missile Technology Control Regime, North Korea said it ""has a right to conduct as many nuclear tests or missile launches as it wants in the event that the supreme interests of the state are infringed upon."" Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials said a high-level U.S. delegation is going to Asia for a series of ""intensive consultations"" on what North Korea's increasingly alarming behavior means for American security alliances in the region. The goal, they said, is to persuade Pyongyang that going back to the negotiating table is the only option. North Korea has been negotiating over its nuclear program with the United States, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea in six-party talks. Seriously complicating matters is the health of ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Officials have said nobody knows who is running North Korea, one of the most opaque and mysterious countries in the world. There is also no clear line of succession in place once Kim dies. iReport.com: A visit to North Korea .

"(CNN) -- The $10,000 prize caught Jordan Teuscher's attention. He read the rules carefully. Teams of five would compete against others from around the country to have the highest percentage of weight loss after 12 weeks. To prevent unhealthy dieting, no one person could lose more than 16.6% of their total body weight. Teuscher wasn't extremely obese, but he had put on more than a few pounds since getting married and starting law school. His family was naturally competitive. If he could persuade them to participate, he thought, they had a good chance of winning the HealthyWage challenge. He talked to his uncle, Jon Whicker, and his sister, who had auditioned for ""The Biggest Loser"" but were not accepted. They agreed to join his team. His mom and dad also hopped on board. The family decided on a name -- ""Will Work for Less Food"" -- and paid their $75 entry fees. Game on. For three months, they cut out sugar and refined carbohydrates; they avoided eating late at night and added exercise to their schedules. They vied for first place with a team named Bravo5A, winning and losing small challenges along the way that only pushed them harder. ""In general, I'm a warrior,"" Whicker says. And as a warrior, ""you're never quite happy with just being ahead -- you want to be way ahead."" Can you smell obesity? In the end, they emerged victorious -- dropping a combined 255 pounds (16% of their total body weight) to win the competition and the $10,000 prize. ""It's been nice to have it off -- to be able to fit into your old clothes, feel comfortable in groups,"" says Teuscher, who lost 47 pounds. ""I feel healthier. Happier."" Whicker used his share of the winnings to put a new motor in his old Mustang. But the real benefits were less materialistic -- his cholesterol went down, his blood pressure normalized and his acid reflux disappeared. ""My son the other day got my wallet and pulled out my driver's license picture ... he looked at it and looked at my wife and said, 'That doesn't look like Dad anymore,'"" Whicker said with a laugh. Teuscher and Whicker have joined another HealthyWage challenge to continue their weight loss journey. The company offers three programs. The Matchup challenge asks teams of five to compete for $10,000; the 10% Challenge allows users to double their money if they lose 10% of their weight in six months; and the BMI Challenge pays users $100 to go from an obese BMI to a healthy BMI in 12 months. HealthyWage isn't the only company to jump on the motivation money train. Competitors such as DietBet.com, GymPact and StickK ask users to put their hard-earned cash on the line in hopes of getting healthy and wealthy. And many company benefits programs have started offering financial incentives to employees who drop weight or quit smoking in hopes of reducing health care costs. Would you lose weight if money were at stake? There's scientific evidence to support their business model. HealthyWage co-founder David Roddenberry started the company in 2009 after seeing a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association that showed financial incentives could encourage weight loss. Last year, a Mayo Clinic study found people who received financial incentives stuck with healthy behaviors longer -- losing, on average, seven more pounds than their colleagues whose wallets weren't linked to weight loss. Of course, money isn't the only motivator in weight loss challenges. ""I think what inspired me the most was the fact that my team members were going to lose money,"" Teuscher says. ""I was really afraid I would be the person that ruined it for everyone."" Peer pressure can help groups lose more weight than individuals fighting for a cash prize, according to a new study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers followed two groups of employees at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Individuals in the first group were offered $100 each month that they met or exceeded their weight loss goals. The second group was organized into teams of five; each team was given $500 to split among those who met their goals, increasing the competition between team members. People in the second group lost almost three times as much weight than those in the first, according to the study.

"(Health.com) -- It sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie: A patient visits a doctor's office and, after a brief surgical procedure, walks away with a microchip under her skin that delivers medication in precisely timed and measured doses. That scenario doesn't seem so futuristic anymore. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced today that they have successfully completed the first trial of a drug-releasing microchip in humans. The results were published on the website of the journal Science Translational Medicine. The pacemaker-sized microchip devices, which were implanted near the waistline of seven 60-something women in Denmark, worked as intended, releasing up to 19 daily doses of an osteoporosis drug that ordinarily requires injections. The implants proved safe, and tests revealed that they delivered the medication as effectively as once-a-day shots. Health.com: How to fight osteoporosis . The devices won't be ready for mainstream use for at least another four years. But the researchers say the technology will ultimately enable people who take injectable drugs for conditions such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis to swap their needles for microchips. Other drugs that could potentially be delivered in this manner include chemotherapy, fertility hormones, and vaccines, they say. ""It's almost like 'Star Trek,' but now it's coming to life,"" says study coauthor Robert Langer, Jr., Sc.D., an institute professor at MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Langer, a chemical engineer, came up with the idea for the drug-delivery device about 15 years ago, while watching a TV show on how microchips are made in the computer industry. Langer and his colleagues at MIT worked on the idea throughout the 1990s, and published the first paper on their research in 1999. That same year, Langer cofounded a privately held company, MicroCHIPS, Inc., to license the technology from MIT and commercialize the device. Health.com: Injecting yourself 101 . Here's how it works: Microchips containing tiny reservoirs of concentrated, freeze-dried medication are secured to the surface of a titanium housing, which also contains a wireless transmitter that communicates with a small portable computer. A surgeon implants the device via a one-inch incision, in an outpatient procedure requiring local anesthesia only. Each reservoir on the microchip holds a single dose of medication and is sealed by a thin metal membrane. When instructed by the computer, the implant sends an electrical current through a membrane and melts it, allowing body fluids to flow into the reservoir and the powdered drug to diffuse into the body. (The melted metal resolidifies on the chip and is not released.) In the recently completed trial, the microchips were loaded with Forteo (teriparatide), a drug used to build bone mass in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The study participants carried the implants for a total of 103 days, and received medication on 20 of those days. Overall, the devices successfully released 94% of the doses as planned. Health.com: 11 foods for healthy bones . One implant malfunctioned due to a faulty microchip circuit, but the researchers caught the problem thanks to the wireless transmitter, says Robert Farra, the president and CEO of MicroCHIPS. ""The on-board diagnostics allowed us to identify right away...that the drug could not be released,"" Farra says. ""There were no safety concerns to the patient and we decided not to include [her] in the study, as our study objective was on safety and efficacy."" The study participants were reportedly untroubled by the device. ""They found the implants pretty much acceptable,"" Farra says. ""They could not feel the device once it was implanted, and they all indicated they would be willing to repeat the procedure."" The fact that several of the women said they forgot about the implant once their incision healed is a ""good sign,"" says John T. Watson, Ph.D., a professor of bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego. Watson adds, however, that the microchip system may not be for everyone. The quality of life of people who take injectable medications ""varies very broadly,"" says Watson, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the study. ""Some people say 'I just don't want an incision' -- so they could opt out easily and elect another approach. On the other hand, there would be some people who would say 'I want this' because [they] want it to be forgettable, sort of like a pacemaker."" Health.com: Prescription drugs that lead double lives . More research and fine-tuning will be needed before the device can even be tested in full-fledged clinical trials, Watson says. The researchers need to establish that it's durable and reliable, for instance. Langer and his colleagues say their implants could be used for brief stretches of 30 to 90 days (to administer pain medication after an injury, say), or for periods of up to a year. ""We think 365 doses is very manageable with the design that we're working on,"" says Farra, noting that MicroCHIPS is currently developing a one-year Forteo implant. S. Louis Bridges, M.D., the director of clinical immunology and rheumatology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in Alabama, says microchip devices could be a boon for people -- such as rheumatoid arthritis patients -- who require regular injections or intravenous infusions. Health.com: Alternative therapies for rheumatoid arthritis . ""Patients tend to do OK, but there are some that absolutely hate [injections],"" Bridges says. Some patients complain that the medicine burns, and some experience so-called injection site reactions in which the surrounding skin becomes red and swollen, he explains. Patient comfort and convenience aren't the only potential benefits of microchips, Farra says. The automatic dosing ensures that people receive the medication exactly as prescribed, so doctors and patients don't have to worry about skipped or inconsistent doses, he says.

"(CNN) -- Germany's St. Pauli plans on further supporting the gay community by permanently flying the rainbow flag -- which symbolizes gay pride -- at its stadium from this season. ""The club has been active for many years against homophobia and discrimination,"" St. Pauli's vice-president Gernot Stenger told the club website. ""With this flag we are giving this highly visible sign that these issues have great importance at St. Pauli and we are working hard on them."" A member of the club's gay and lesbian fan club, Dirk Brullau, backed the initiative and said it would be a ""quantum leap for the football world"" if a Bundesliga team followed suit. Hamburg's St. Pauli, which enjoys a cult following due to the skull and crossbones shown on the flag of its supporters, plays in Germany's second tier. Its move comes less than two months after American Robbie Rogers became the first openly gay male athlete to play in a U.S. professional match. Rogers initially retired from soccer in February, announcing he was gay. He unretired and signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy of the MLS, making his debut in late May. Jason Collins, a pro basketball player who announced he was gay in April, tweeted Rogers good luck. ""People are just really growing and accepting and loving,"" Rogers said earlier in May. ""Those other things are just not that important to them. ""I think as the younger get older and the generations come and go, I think times are just becoming more accepting."" But for now no soccer player from the Bundesliga or one of the other elite divisions in Europe has come out as gay, with German international teammates Mario Gomez and Tim Wiese seemingly taking different views on whether they should. Three years ago, Gomez urged gay players to go public. Wiese, however, said they would be ""destroyed"" by ""merciless fans,"" the Guardian reported. German Chancellor Angela Merkel last year said gay footballers shouldn't be worried about revealing their sexuality. ""Anyone who sums up the strength and bravery should know that they live in a land where they have nothing to fear,"" said Merkel.","German team St. Pauli to fly rainbow flag in recognition of the gay community .

"(CNN) -- Men in a civil union will now be allowed to become bishops in the Church of England, but they are not allowed to have sex. Intercourse between two men -- or two women -- remains a sin. ""Homosexual genital acts fall short of the Christian ideal and are to be met with a call to repentance and the exercise of compassion,"" according to Anglican doctrine. Men and women in same-sex unions were already allowed to serve as priests in the Church of England, but there was a moratorium on advancement to the episcopate -- becoming a bishop -- while the church considered the issue. The church announced Friday that if men in celibate civil unions may be priests, then there is no reason for them not to be bishops, as long as they are ""living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality."" Any priest looking to become a bishop must undergo a thorough examination of ""personal and family circumstances,"" according to a statement released by the House of Bishops of the Church of England. Female priests are barred from advancing to the position of bishop, as a vote on the measure in the church failed to pass lay approval last November despite an overwhelming majority of support within the church hierarchy. Women have been permitted to enter the priesthood since the early 1990s. The church defines marriage ""as a faithful, committed, permanent and legally sanctioned relationship between a man and a woman, is central to the stability and health of human society."" It believes sex should be practiced exclusively within a marriage. The British parliament is expected to consider legislation allowing same-sex marriage, but the Church of England and the Church in Wales would be prohibited from performing wedding ceremonies as long as it remains against canon law. In 2005, Britain allowed same-sex couples to register civil partnerships, prompting the church to consider the issue. It does not bless civil unions of any kind, for fear some of them may be sexual. But it also does not exclude gays and lesbians from the flock, according to it 2005 deliberations. The Anglican Church is a protestant denomination intimately associated with the American Episcopal Church. The church and state in Britain are formally connected. The two archbishops of the church, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York, along with 24 other bishops, have seats in Parliament in the House of Lords. Though women may not yet rise to high positions in its clergy, Queen Elizabeth is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Read more: Proposal would allow same-sex marriage in England, Wales .

"(CNN) -- As John Avlon has recently calculated, there is a real possibility that the Republican primary process could fail to yield a majority winner. What would happen then? Journalists like to speculate about ""brokered conventions"": the kind of conventions we had 50 and 100 years ago, where party bosses chose presidential nominees in smoke-filled rooms. But you can't have a ""brokered convention"" in a system where there are no ""brokers."" Here's an example of how the old system worked: . In 1952, most rank-and-file Republicans wanted to nominate Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio, the leader of the party's conservative wing. In the dozen or so primaries and caucuses held that year, Taft won nearly 2.8 million Republican votes, as compared with only 2 million for Dwight Eisenhower. But about three-quarters of the states had neither primaries nor caucuses. Their delegates were chosen at state party conventions, and those delegates answered to powerful state officeholders, typically the state governor. So when the GOP convened in Chicago in 1952, those powerful state officeholders could negotiate among themselves, confident that they controlled the delegate count from their state. That's how Eisenhower won in 1952. The two most powerful Republican governors in the country -- Thomas Dewey of New York and Earl Warren of California -- preferred Eisenhower, and so Eisenhower it was. That's not how it would happen today. Modern governors do not control their state parties the way governors did in the 1950s. And today's delegates won't do as they are told. What would happen today? Two possible scenarios: . 1) Imagine that Romney falls just slightly short of the 1144 needed to nominate. In this scenario, an individual party chairman from a smaller state with more old-fashioned rules might be lured to find some way to redirect his state's votes to Romney. That is what happened in 1976, when Gerald Ford narrowly defeated Ronald Reagan by gaining the last-minute support of the Mississippi state delegation; that's the most recent occasion when a convention chose a nominee. The problem is that there are many fewer such old-fashioned states today than there were in 1976, with the result that the price such ""available"" states might be able to exact will be considerably higher than it was back then. Ford only needed to replace his vice presidential candidate, dumping Nelson Rockefeller, anathema to party conservatives, in favor of Bob Dole, then a conservative hero. But what price would be exacted from Romney? And what effect would that have on the election? Romney badly needs to pivot back to the center for the general election. Would a convention-season deal to get the votes of strongly conservative delegates veto that pivot and doom his hopes? 2) Imagine now that Romney falls substantially short of the 1144. He might have won more votes and delegates than anybody else, but it becomes hard to argue that he is a clear favorite. Party insiders begin to murmur again about the need to find another candidate. In an earlier era of American politics, that could be done. In 1920, a conclave of Republican Party bosses could bypass stronger candidates to choose Sen. Warren G. Harding, a politician whose main claim to fame was that he had kept on good terms with all party factions, and who would go on to win the presidency. In 1940, Republican Party leaders chose a total outsider, Wendell Willkie, a businessman who had not only never been elected to anything, but who had actually been a Roosevelt delegate at the Democratic convention of 1932. But now? Who even are the Republican Party leaders -- aside from Roger Ailes, that is? The big donors? But they already chose Romney and now find they cannot make their choice stick. The big change in American politics over the past two decades has been the decline of followership. Party members expect the party to serve them -- one major reason that both parties have drifted to the ideological extremes since the 1970s. That expectation would only be intensified and concentrated in a party convention with Fox News and talk radio whipping and riling the delegates into angry emotionalism. A decision-making convention in modern times won't submit to the edicts of smoke-filled rooms. The delegates will want their own way. If Romney fails to win the primaries over the next few months, brace yourself: not for a replay of 1920, when Republican bosses made their coldly calculated deal, but for a replay of 1896, when the Democratic Convention went wild for William Jennings Bryan after one thrilling speech. Of course, Bryan went on to lose in a landslide. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Thirty-one years ago, the four men serving me tea at the table of an attractive house in Nepal's capital were taking punishment from the Antarctic weather and an equally unforgiving enemy on a remote island chain in the South Atlantic. ""Suddenly we were in the coldest part of the country, with clothing and things not suitable for a climate like that,"" said Chandra Kumar Pradhan, as he recalled his time as a soldier serving with the British Army during the Falklands War in 1982. ""You're walking with all those loads and everything, six or seven hours, you were sweating like hell; and then suddenly you stop, as soon as you stop you started digging and sweat more, and then... you were freezing, because the wind was blowing into the sweat, it was horrible."" Despite the fact that the 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles Regiment were a part of the British task force sent to repel an Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands -- known as the Malvinas by Argentina, who also claim them -- their role has been largely absent from media accounts of the conflict. Bloody conflict . This is probably because they never got to fire a shot against their enemy -- though they felt the brunt of Argentine bombs throughout the 74-day conflict, with many of their number injured by flying shrapnel. By the end of the conflict Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645, while Britain's civil and military losses amounted to 255, according to the Ministry of Defense. The four comrades -- Bhuwansing Limbu, Chandra Kumar Pradhan, Deoman Limbu and Nirbahadur Tamang -- are Nepalese and veterans of a detachment of a British Army that harks back to its colonial past. The Brigade of Gurkhas, composed of more than 3,000 soldiers of Nepalese descent, who traditionally served in the British Indian Army before India became independent in 1947. The four were also talking to an Argentine for the first time in their lives, which may have been a problem if the deep silence that followed this revelation was anything to go by. Shared interests . Fortunately, two things saved the interview. First, I live in Hong Kong, where they were based and trained for many years before Britain's handover of the territory to China in 1997. Secondly, we share a passion for hiking -- a hugely popular pastime in Hong Kong -- and a conversation about the city's trails helped defuse the uneasiness. These men had joined the army in the 1960s, having had their first experience of war during the Borneo Confrontation -- a conflict between British-backed Malaysia and Indonesia that ended in 1966. ""I was very new at the time, I had been with the regiment for, I think, two weeks,"" Pradhan said. He was just 18 when he first saw action. On leaving the British Army in the 1990s, the men could have chosen to live in the country they had defended. But they chose their home in the Himalayas. ""I have been around the world, and Nepal is the only country where you can see the mountains from your window,"" Pradhan said. ""I love Nepal, most of our relatives and friends are here,"" Bhuwansing Limbu added. ""One [of my] daughters and two [of my] sons have UK citizenship, but they don't like to go there, therefore, I like to stay here in my motherland,"" Nirbahadur Tamang explained. Argentine ambition . These men who have seen the world but never visited Argentina. ""I always tell my daughter, one day I will definitely go to Argentina,"" said Pradhan. ""But if we go to Argentina and if they know we are Gurkhas who fought in the Falklands, will they be angry with us?"" I couldn't reply that question. Nationalists exist everywhere but I believe most Argentines want to forgive, forget and get on with their lives. At the end of the day, most of the men sent by my country to fight one of the most professional armies on Earth were still teenagers. ""You could see on the faces of these guys, they were not fully trained for the war,"" Pradhan recalled. ""They were conscripts -- we knew that later on,"" Deoman Limbu added. As the men cycled through their wartime memories one thing became apparent: there was no clear advantage for either side during the confrontation. ""They had better assets, they had better clothing,"" Pradhan said. ""All of their weapons were deployed there,"" Deoman Limbu continued. The men described having had one of their best battlefield meals from abandoned Argentine rations. Alternative outcome . And this led to a second silence in the conversation while they pondered something else. What would have happened if the Argentine military had enjoyed a more favorable outcome? The hemisphere's bloodiest dictatorship would have been strengthened and lengthened. Fortunately, the ruling junta in Buenos Aires fell shortly after our defeat. I was just an eight-year-old boy when democracy finally ended our plight, and I am lucky to have almost no recollection of those bitter years; I belong to the ""almost-unscathed generation."" One of the most emotional parts of our encounter -- well after the end of our formal interview -- came when I thanked these aging Nepali men, who were once young and thirsty for adventure, for helping to bring freedom to my country -- even if they didn't know it and despite the cost in human lives, British and Argentine.","Gurkha units of British army deployed to fight in the Falklands War in 1982 .

"(CNN) -- We don't use the F-word in my family. And by F, I'm not talking about the F-bombs, because those get dropped from time to time. I'm talking about the word ""fat."" The word is banned from my house with the same vigilance that racist language would not be tolerated. Extreme, perhaps, but I have a husband who went through a chubby stage and still bears the scars of his prepubescent ridicule. I also have two tween children with very different body types and low thresholds for teasing. Mention weight or body shape among my family and the reaction can be nuclear, unleashing a tsunami of tears, screams and ""I hate you!"" Extreme body awareness and the barf-starve-smoke-yourself-to-thinness regimen is hardly new for teenagers and young women. But the age at which the obsession is starting seems to be creeping even younger. Today, according to the Duke Center for Eating Disorders at Duke University, more than 40% of all 9- and 10-year-old girls have already been on a diet. The National Eating Disorders Association reports that 40-60% of children between ages 6 and 12 are worried about their weight and 70% want to slim down. Maybe this isn't so surprising given the aggressively narrow proportions in girls' clothing these days in trendy skinny jeans, Lycra leggings and unforgiving clingy tops that are all the rage among the under-12 set. It's no wonder that young girls are more aware than ever of their own mini-muffin tops or ""baby fat"" as grandmas call it. Compound clothes with the omnipresent camera phone, photo stream and ""selfies,"" and it's a recipe ripe for self-loathing. We know that there is a very real childhood obesity epidemic in this country plaguing entire communities and it is one of the most significant health issues of our time. Our snack food nation is chock full of overstuffed soda-coma kids who play outside less and eat more. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2010, more than one-third of children and teenagers in the United States were overweight or obese. The number is alarming. It's a national crisis that everyone from first lady Michelle Obama on down seems intent on tackling. In fact, my daughter's elementary school participated in an amped-up fitness program this year. The program included cardio and flexibility tests, weighing the children and taking a body mass index. The results were printed with color-coded columns that red-flagged danger zones for kids at risk in various categories. I happened to walk into the school on a morning when some fourth-grade girls were being herded into a corner next to a scale and weighed by the physical education teacher, who then typed the children's weight into a laptop. As the girls waited to be weighed, some looked like they were about to burst into tears and others like they were going to throw up. One of the tiniest girls in the grade stood next to one of the largest, in a painfully awkward scene that seemed stolen from a Judy Blume novel. For the next few days the chatter among the girls was ""What do you weigh?"" My daughter came home stressed; she, like many of the girls, didn't want to share her weight or even step on a scale. The whole ordeal was mortifying, even among a group of average-sized girls. I told my daughter she didn't need to tell anyone her weight, and if pushed, I said she could lie. Having just been to the pediatrician for my daughter's annual physical, she and I knew exactly what she weighed and that she was perfectly healthy. But the number on the scale startled her. On the cusp of puberty, many of the girls' bodies are changing, and emotionally they are more fragile than ever. I told our school principal that I didn't want my daughter weighed. Even at age 9 or 10, regardless of the number on the scale, it just felt like a public shaming. ""We're very concerned about some of the children's anti-obesity programs and messaging that's happening now,"" said Claire Mysko, manager of the National Eating Disorders Association's Proud2Bme program. ""They are well intentioned, of course, but when the focus is on BMI as an indicator of health and when kids are getting weighed at school and comparing notes, it can really be a trigger for kids who are already feeling vulnerable. There is research out there that these programs may be backfiring. The kids are coming home more anxious. The goal is to shift the conversation away from BMI and talk about what makes your body feel good."" A few years ago there was a public outcry when Dara-Lynn Weiss documented in Vogue the severe diet she put her 7-year-old daughter on. The article was part confessional about Weiss' own body issues and struggle with food, as well as her yearlong quest to slim down her daughter. Weiss got the mother lode of scorn heaped on her by the blogosphere and even the media. But after Weiss learned that her daughter was obese at 6 years old standing 4 feet 4 inches and weighing 93 pounds, didn't she have to take some serious intervention? My daughter enjoys a good meal, especially if mac and cheese is on the menu. So when she went to sleepaway camp at 8 years old, I had prepped her ahead of time about making healthy food choices: Make sure to eat lots of fruit and drink plenty of water. Stay away from all the white and creamy ranch salad dressings. Choose the clear ones that look like vinaigrette, I told her. One of the first letters she sent home that summer was all about what she ate for dinner. ""Mommy you'll be so proud of me, I didn't eat the white dressing. I ate the clear one!"" she wrote. The letter had me laughing and a little worried. At 8 years old, had I started the beginning of a life-long eating disorder or am I just making for a conscientious and healthy eater? ""As parents you have to set boundaries but you don't want to make certain foods off limits or shameful. You also don't want to set it up that every time you have the chocolate cake that it's indulgent or sinful,"" Mysko said. ""We don't want kids thinking about calories or fat grams and stoking that fear. And shame is not a motivator of healthy behavior."" Some children hit the genetic lottery and don't have to worry about their metabolism or weight, but many more, boys included, feel the embarrassment of being the bigger kid. Experts say that the key for parents is to not obsess about the number on the scale and also to look at their own attitudes about food and weight. If every time you walk by the mirror you're scrutinizing yourself, you're sending a dangerous message to your own children. ""Weight is a fear that so many parents have. But we have to shift the focus away from weight and BMI. It's less about making sure kids don't get fat or that fat kids get thin,"" Mysko said. ""The conversation should be about how can we make all kids healthy and feel good about themselves.""","Mom Wendy Sachs wonders how to create healthy food habits for her kids .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Negative headlines about drugs and sex abuse charges greatly diminished Michael Jackson's earning potential, an entertainment consultant said. Jackson's album sales dropped sharply from his peak and his ""likability"" rating turned dramatically negative after ""significantly negative headlines, drug abuse and other issues,"" Eric Briggs testified. Briggs' testimony in the wrongful death trial of AEG Live is intended to counter an expert hired by Jackson lawyers who concluded the pop icon would have earned another $1.5 billion from world tours had he not died while preparing for his comeback concerts. AEG Live placed a big bet on Jackson's ability to sell tickets when it signed him to a three-year deal for his ""This Is It"" tour. While the company worked hard to convince Jackson in 2009 to let them produce and promote the concerts, it paid Briggs more than $700,000 to prepare testimony for this trial questioning Jackson's star power. In fact, AEG Live executives bragged at the time about how Jackson's first 50 London concerts sold out in record time with enough potential buyers lined up to sell out another 50 shows. If a jury decides that AEG Live is liable for Jackson's death, his lost earnings potential would factor into their determination of damages to be paid by the concert promoter. Michael Jackson's drug use explored in trial . Michael Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending it negligently hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death. AEG Live lawyers argue that Jackson, not their executives, chose and controlled Dr. Conrad Murray and that they had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving Jackson in the privacy of his bedroom. They contend the singer was so deceptive and secretive about his medical treatments and drug use that even his family did not know. To help make their case, they'll play video of Jackson's youngest brother Randy being questioned about it. His testimony is expected to be shown to jurors after Brigg's testimony is concluded Wednesday. Jackson's oldest sister Rebbie and ex-wife Debbie Rowe are also lined up to testify in the coming days. AEG Live is compelling their testimony, hoping to get revelations about Jackson's drug use. Tuesday marks the 59th day of testimony in the trial, which the judge said could take another six weeks in a Los Angeles courtroom. MJ's Q score . Briggs testified that he studied ""Q score"" data for Jackson, the trend of his album sales and his stability to conclude that Jackson had a low chance of earning money from endorsements and sponsorships. An entertainment industry analyst hired by Jackson lawyers testified he was ""reasonably certain"" Jackson would have earned $300 million from endorsements and sponsorships. Briggs disputed the estimate, saying that while Jackson was ""a great performer"" companies decide which celebrities to align their products with based on ""likability"" as measured by ""Q scores."" Jackson's ""Q score"" in 1993 was in line with the average male musical performer, with about one person of every two surveyed saying they liked him, Briggs said. That was the year Jackson announced he had a problem with painkillers, and he entered rehab. His score became dramatically negative over the next decade, Briggs said. By 2006, a year after he was acquitted in a child molestation trial, more than seven people said they disliked Jackson for every one who said they liked him, Briggs testified. Companies would be ""very anxious"" about putting someone with such negative ""likability"" next to their products, he said. Jackson lawyer Brian Panish will have a chance to question Briggs about his conclusions Tuesday.

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- Attorneys for the family of an unarmed Florida teen shot to death last month plan to pursue a civil case against a homeowner's association, the family's lawyer said Saturday. Daryl Parks, attorney for the family of Trayvon Martin, spoke to board members of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) about the case. He said there is evidence that the Twin Lakes homeowner's association told residents who saw suspicious activity to call George Zimmerman if they could not contact the police, according to an NABJ statement. Martin, 17, was killed February 26 as he walked to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida, after a trip to the convenience store. Police say he was shot by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who says he was acting in self-defense. Martin was unarmed, carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea, according to police. Protesters upset about Martin's death took to streets in cities across the country Saturday, with some questioning why Zimmerman has not been arrested. Other protests are planned for Sunday. ""There are inconsistencies in our U.S. laws that allow people to claim self-defense as a way to get away with murder,"" said CNN iReporter Jarvis Matthews. A student at Georgetown University, he sent video from a march in Washington, D.C. Another demonstration was staged alongside a busy road in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where many of the protesters wore hooded sweatshirts like the one Martin had on when he was shot. ""In a nutshell I think this case is not being handled properly -- that is why we have so many protests. It was a senseless situation,"" said CNN iReporter Ron Campbell. And in Sanford, Florida, a handful of members from the New Black Panther Party rallied and offered a $10,000 reward for Zimmerman's ""capture."" ""It's time for us, as black men, to take justice in our own hands. If you won't give us justice, we will have to take justice,"" said Florida organizer Mikhail Muhammad. ""An eye for an eye. A life for a life."" The New Black Panther Party, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a ""virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization,"" is distinct from the better-known Black Panther Party, founded in the late 1960s. The city of Sanford responded to the bounty offer by calling for ""calm heads and no vigilante justice."" ""Attempts by civilians to take any person into custody may result in criminal charges or unnecessary violence,"" it said in a statement. Meanwhile, a lawyer for the man at the center of the death investigation said Florida's ""stand your ground"" law doesn't apply to the shooting that killed the teen. ""In my legal opinion, that's not really applicable to this case. The statute on 'stand your ground' is primarily when you're in your house,"" said Craig Sonner, Zimmerman's attorney. ""This is self-defense, and that's been around for forever -- that you have a right to defend yourself. So the next issue (that) is going to come up is, was he justified in using the amount of force he did?"" The 2005 law allows people to use deadly force anywhere they have a right to be if they have reasonable fear an assailant could seriously harm them or someone else. It also eliminated a long-standing ""duty to retreat"" in the face of imminent harm, asserting that would-be crime victims have the right to ""stand their ground"" and ""meet force with force"" when attacked. The case has sparked a national debate over the Florida law and concerns about racial profiling. Martin was black and Zimmerman is white Hispanic. Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor, Angela Corey, to look into the case. She said her office will decide whether to charge Zimmerman, clear him or send the case to a grand jury. The case has also prompted a U.S. Justice Department investigation, which is in the fact-finding stage. The Sanford Police Department said officers were prohibited from arresting Zimmerman the night of the shooting because physical evidence and testimony supported his claim that he acted in self-defense in accordance with Florida law. The police department gave the explanation to City Manager Norton Bonaparte, who included it in a letter to the community about the case, posted on the city's website. Sonner said he and Zimmerman have not discussed what happened the night Martin was shot, though he said Zimmerman has talked with authorities -- unaccompanied by counsel -- whenever they have asked him to do so. Zimmerman said he was driving in his gated community when he saw Martin walking and called 911 to report a suspicious person. Zimmerman told the dispatcher he was following the boy, but the dispatcher told him that wasn't necessary. Moments later, several neighbors called 911 to report a commotion outside, and police arrived to find Martin dead of a gunshot wound. Sonner says his client was injured that night and went to the hospital with a broken nose and a serious cut on the back of his head. ""This is not about self-defense,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton told a crowd in New York on Saturday. ""This is about a man deciding somebody, based on who he was, was a suspect and that he would take matters into his own hands."" Sharpton, who attended a rally in Sanford earlier this week, promised a ""spring offensive of non-violent protests"" nationwide about the case. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who signed the ""stand your ground"" bill into law, said Friday that he does not believe it applies to the case. ""Stand your ground means stand your ground. It doesn't mean chase after somebody who's turned their back,"" Bush said while visiting a university campus in Texas. Sanford police said Zimmerman did not indicate a chase, telling them instead that ""he had lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck to meet the police officer when he says he was attacked by Trayvon,"" the police said in the letter posted by Bonaparte. Sonner said he believes Zimmerman's life is in danger and has advised him to keep a low profile. ""This case is spinning out of control,"" he said. ""I hope there's a way to rein things in so it doesn't become an issue of a racial battle. I hope that things come back so that there can be a time for justice and for healing and not for just skipping the whole judicial process and going straight to sentencing.""

"(CNN) -- With extreme heat and the worst drought in half a century continuing to plague the farm states, there are important lessons to be learned for all of us -- farmers, consumers and the world's poorest populations alike -- about the effect of climate change. The Agriculture Department announced this season's first major crop yield forecasts, and they weren't pretty: a nationwide average of 123.4 bushels of corn per acre, the lowest level since 1995. Soybean yield is expected to be low too, though not as bad as corn. The United States, which is the world's largest producer and exporter of staple grains, is grappling with the biggest surprise in production shortfalls since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Certainly, this July surpassed July 1936 as the hottest month on record. So, how will the devastation affect U.S. crop farmers? Drought, heat bring spiders out . Since mid-June, corn prices have risen about 60%, more than twice the projected decline in yield. This means that farm revenue will go up. About 90% of the corn acreage is backed by a generously subsidized federal insurance program, described by Steven Colbert as ""Obamacare for the corn,"" so crop farmers will be just fine. Livestock farmers who use corn to feed their animals could see higher costs, but most have contracts with processors who provide their feed grains. What about consumers? Will high commodity prices affect the prices of food you eat? Not much, actually. Commodity prices account for just a tiny share of retail food prices. If you're a shrewd shopper, next year you may notice higher prices for meat, milk, eggs, and cheese and all types of processed foods. The USDA estimates that food prices will increase 3 to 4% in 2013. This is not going to radically change your life. People in rich countries like the U.S. are not going to eat much less or much differently as a result of modestly higher prices. The crop losses will have the most effect on the world's poorest populations. About 2 billion people still live on $2 a day or less. Many of them live in urban areas of developing countries. Often, they must spend half or more of their income on food, the bulk coming from staple grains like corn, wheat and rice. For these people, a huge rise in grain prices is more than noticeable -- it can literally break their budget. In 2008 and 2011, when corn prices went up to levels nearly as high as today's, the world saw a sharp rise in food riots. Many pointed to wheat prices as a catalyst for revolutions in the Middle East, including Egypt, Tunisia and Libya. It is not hard to see that food-related security problems overseas could cost us far more than the extra pennies we'll pay at the grocery store. NASA scientist links climate change, extreme weather . The U.S. can ease price pains somewhat by suspending government rules that mandate biofuel production. In 2011, about 40% of U.S. corn crops were diverted to ethanol (a quarter, if we take into account that nutritional content is recycled back into feeds for animals in the form of distiller grains). But this seems untenable politically. The larger and more important issue is whether this year's bad crop yield is an omen of what we should expect going forward. Record high temperatures are occurring with far greater frequency than in decades past, and crop yields decline sharply in extreme heat. In research that Wolfram Schlenker and I have conducted using the Hadley III climate model, we project yield declines of about 20% over the next 20 years, holding all else the same. This summer's extreme heat may just become typical in 15 years. Some have criticized these projections as too pessimistic, and they just might be. An atmosphere richer in carbon dioxide concentrations may allow plants to transpire less water during photosynthesis, and thus, improve drought tolerance. Farmers can adjust to earlier planting times, perhaps avoiding some extreme temperatures during the sensitive flowering period, and lengthening the growing season. And new drought-tolerant crop varieties have been developed. This season was a good test of these adaptive strategies. It appears they didn't work. Carbon dioxide concentrations are much higher than they were in 1983 and 1988, when it was nearly as hot as this summer. And farmers planted much earlier than usual, many using new drought-tolerant varieties. Record drought is good business for some . For now, we can take a little comfort that ample harvests in the Dakotas, Minnesota and parts of the South could make up for some of the decimated crops in the central Midwest this year. But next year? And the years after? In the long term, a warming world will be a difficult challenge for our crops and all of us. Complete coverage: drought .

"Washington (CNN) -- The dinner was billed as a ""Celebration of Service."" The honorees: Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The hosts: the Federalist Society, an influential conservative legal group whose membership includes judges, lawmakers and government officials. Little news was made at the society's recent three-day convention, but the appearance of perhaps the Supreme Court's most right-leaning members was buzzworthy and just the latest chapter in what can be read as both drama and farce: the future of health care reform in the U.S. and the sideline war over who will be on hand to decide it. The high-stakes legal fight will be argued by the nine-member bench in March, with a ruling expected by June. And if advocates on both sides of the debate have their way, perhaps only seven, even six justices could decide what shapes up to be the biggest constitutional fight in a decade. The timing of Scalia's and Thomas' appearance especially outrages liberals, coming as it did just hours after the court privately agreed to accept the health care cases for review. There have been calls for Scalia and especially Thomas to recuse themselves or pull out of hearing the issue. And from the right: similar demands of Justice Elena Kagan. As a top member of President Obama's Justice Department last year, conservatives allege, she may have been more involved than once believed in preparing legal strategy for the health care appeals just before she was chosen for the high court. None of the justices appear ready to step aside, something many legal analysts say is both proper and expected. ""We have attacks on both justices on the right, like Justice Thomas, and on the left, Elena Kagan, trying to influence the outcome of cases by getting them to recuse,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a Washington lawyer and founder of Scotusblog.com. ""Particularly, we see this in the health care litigation that's coming to the Supreme Court. All of those efforts are doomed. The justices realize that they need to participate in the case, it's their constitutional duty, and I think this is just political posturing, on both sides, by activists."" Losing just one justice could make a difference . A loss of just one justice from ruling on an issue like health care would be huge, making a difference perhaps in the ultimate outcome. No wonder activists have launched a political and legal war to try to manipulate the judicial playing field to each side's advantage. And why should outside groups have all the fun? To no one's surprise, members of Congress also demand a piece of the action. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, demanded last week that the attorney general be more forthcoming about Kagan's involvement. ""The public has a right to know both the full extent of Justice Kagan's involvement with this legislation while she was (the Justice Department's) solicitor general, as well as her previously stated views and opinions about the legislation while she was serving as solicitor general,"" Smith wrote. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and three other senators echoed calls for more records on Kagan's government correspondence. The 51-year-old Kagan was the administration's top government lawyer handling appeals to the Supreme Court. Her nomination by Obama in May 2010, and the weeks leading up to it, came at a time when Congress had passed -- and the president signed -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The health care reform law would significantly change how Americans receive medical services and has been the subject of six current appeals pending at the high court. Twenty-eight states and dozens of individual plaintiffs have opposed the law. During her confirmation hearings to the high court last year, Kagan said she sat in ""at least one meeting where the existence of the litigation was briefly mentioned, but none where any substantive discussion of the litigation occurred."" The White House has long insisted that she was ""walled off"" from involvement in the internal health care law discussions. After two conservative groups sued, the department turned over some documents related to Kagan. One e-mail from her to fellow department official Laurence Tribe talked about an upcoming House vote on health care: ""I hear they have the votes, Larry!! Simply amazing."" Another e-mail from her deputy at the time, Neal Katyal, indicated that Kagan asked her office ""to be involved in this set of issues."" That, says conservative lawyer Carrie Severino, proves that Kagan is ""the justice who knew too much."" ""The president is now asking her to adopt the very same positions her office helped craft for him on this matter, but this time, as a Supreme Court justice,"" said Severino, of the Judicial Crisis Network. ""Her jump from advocate to judge on the same issue raises profound questions about the propriety of her continued participation in his case. Moreover, the legitimacy of any decision where she is in the majority or plurality would be instantly suspect if she chooses not to recuse herself."" Severino is a former law clerk to Thomas, himself the target of attacks on the left. Thomas' wife opposed health care law . Congressional Democrats have separately called on Thomas to pull out, citing his recent lapse in reporting the income of his wife for 13 straight years, as required by federal disclosure laws. The justice said the information was ""inadvertently omitted,"" and his defenders note that his wife's employment history for a variety of conservative causes was widely publicized. Virginia Thomas had worked for, and later founded, her own advocacy group, Liberty Central. Since she has openly opposed the health care bill, many liberals have said, her political activities raise questions about Justice Thomas' own judicial independence and impartiality. ""To believe that Justice Thomas didn't know how to fill out a basic disclosure form is absurd,"" said Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, on behalf of 20 colleagues. ""I cannot determine guilt or innocence, but I can request that the government do our due diligence in investigating a situation that strikes me, and many members of Congress, as suspicious."" Slaughter separately has asked the Justice Department and judiciary's administrative office to investigate. Thomas' liberal colleagues -- current Justice Stephen Breyer and retired Justice John Paul Stevens -- have recently defended him, suggesting that he can hear the health care cases with impartiality. Progressive groups Common Cause and Alliance for Justice say the Scalia/Thomas celebratory dinner was a ""stunning breach of ethics."" The Federalist Society event, say liberals, was nothing more than a fundraiser, with donors that included pharmaceutical company Pfizer. ""The justices were wining and dining at a black-tie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the court,"" Common Cause President Bob Edgar said. ""Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality and is unacceptable."" Among those on the official program for the dinner were McConnell and attorney Paul Clement, himself a former solicitor general, who will argue the health care cases as a private lawyer on behalf of a coalition of two dozen states. Justices ultimately make the call . Unlike other members of the federal judiciary, the justices decide for themselves whether a conflict of interest exists, requiring disqualification. The binding Code of Conduct of U.S. Judges requires recusal when ""impartiality might reasonably be questioned,"" including having a family member directly involved in the case or if there is a financial interest, such as a justice owning stock in company being sued. In Kagan's case, the code also demands recusal if a judge -- while serving in government -- ""participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case or controversy."" As a result, the newest justice had decided on her own to withdraw from considering at least 28 other cases the high court eventually accepted for review. The court by tradition will not openly discuss when to recuse, and that is true with Thomas, Kagan and Scalia. It also will not speculate on the outcome of cases or succumb to political or legal analysis. The written opinion will be the only way the court will officially speak. ""While the health care cases have huge political overtones, obviously, I think the justices are probably going to put them to the side,"" said Scotusblog.com's Goldstein. ""The legal stakes are so high that I don't think they'll pay attention that much, if at all, to the fact that it's occurring in an election cycle. They have just got to get the case right."" Not having to explain themselves when ethical issues arise has led to well-meaning criticism to justices are ultimately accountable to no one, perhaps too arrogant or detached to see warning signs, that may do ultimate damage to the prestige and well-earned independence the courts have earned. But saying nothing or doing nothing in the face of such criticism is the familiar chosen path of a justice, whose professional and personal makeup urges a cautious, detached approach. For Thomas and Kagan, that will probably be enough to keep them participating in the health care scrum. For them, the bigger fights are not from outside but within the marbled walls of the court itself: the competitive, often ruthless internal command for a five-vote majority. All else is a mere prologue to a story nine robed people will soon be writing.","Thomas, Kagan and Scalia are at center of legal, political battle over case .
Many have called for them to recuse themselves or step aside during ruling .
Opponents cite previous litigation, political ties to key stakeholders ."

"Northern Syria (CNN) -- They packed one on top of another -- children, parents, grandparents -- onto motorcycles, as many as six at a time, and then sped away as fast as they could. Others clambered into cars, as gunfire crackled around them. There was no time to wait, with violence engulfing their home city of Aleppo. These families were not alone. Amid intensifying shelling and heavy weapon fire in Syria's most populated city, a U.N. official -- citing the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent -- said that about 200,000 people have fled Aleppo over the past two days. Fighting rages in Aleppo . Some went to neighboring towns and villages they hoped would be safe, while others successfully made the 55-kilometer (35-mile) trek north across the Turkish border. But not everyone has been able to get away. Valerie Amos, the U.N.'s under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said Sunday in a statement that some residents had huddled in schools and other public buildings trying to find some safety amid the carnage. Basic necessities -- like mattresses, hygiene items, food and drinking water -- are in perilously short supply, she added. ""It is not known how many people remain trapped in places where fighting continues today,"" Amos said. Not long ago, Aleppo was busy as Syria's commercial and cultural hub. The northern Syrian city has seen considerable death and destruction over the past few months, after popular anti-government protests spurred a bloody crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad's forces and, eventually, a civil war with organized fighting forces on both sides. Still, the violence wasn't always on the level of places like Homs and the Damascus suburbs. Historic Aleppo torn apart by war -- again . In the past week, Aleppo has become a major focal point in the war. After taking over surrounding towns and villages, rebel fighters have pushed to try to control the city itself. They've had some success, managing to secure key locations and even set up checkpoints. An eerie, relative calm prevailed in pockets of the city on Sunday. Families gathered on balconies, while children walked the streets as if nothing had happened. But that was hardly the case elsewhere in Aleppo, parts of which appeared largely devoid of civilians. Rockets and mortar shells had fallen and continued to fall in many residential areas, while Syrian troops defending a military base located just north of the city fired into neighborhoods. Concerned about innocent civilians getting caught up in the violence, Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby said Sunday that he believed war crimes were being committed in Aleppo. Abo Hamdi, an activist, said government forces, tanks and heavy machinery have tried to overrun the neighborhood of Salahuddin, but by Sunday night they were on the outside looking in. He said that opposition Free Syrian Army fighters have brought in ammunition and taken positions around the neighborhood, though government forces with tanks and heavy artillery were stationed nearby. ""The situation in the city of Aleppo is very critical and quite serious,"" he said. ""We are trapped in this neighborhood, but the ... Free Syrian Army is preparing for fierce battle.""

"(CNN) -- Eight people died when a bus carrying church members home blew a front tire, crossed the grassy median of Interstate 40 in eastern Tennessee, clipped an SUV and collided with a tractor-trailer before overturning, officials said Wednesday. Six people on the eastbound bus were killed, along with one of three occupants of the SUV and the tractor-trailer driver, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said in a statement. ""We hope and pray that there will be no more,"" Sgt. Bill Miller told reporters Wednesday evening. There were 18 people on the bus, which was from Statesville, North Carolina, officials said. It was carrying senior adults who attend Front Street Baptist Church in Statesville. Fourteen people were injured, the highway patrol said. The wreck occurred about 2 p.m. in Jefferson County, about 40 miles east of Knoxville, said Tennessee Department of Safety spokeswoman Dalya Qualls. It was on Interstate 40 near the split with Interstate 81. After the bus went out of control, it struck the westbound Chevrolet Tahoe and the tractor-trailer, officials said. The tractor-trailer caught fire. Miller said eight of the injured were listed as critical, two as serious and four as stable at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. Hospital spokeswoman Susan Wyatt said the church group was returning home from a trip to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Dionne Stutts, wife of Front Street Baptist Senior Pastor Tim Stutts, said the church did not have specifics on anyone traveling on the bus. The church group was on its way back to Statesville from the 17th annual Fall Jubilee preaching and singing conference in Gatlinburg, Stutts said. Her husband was devastated by the news, Stutts said. He and the church youth minister were traveling to Tennessee. Front Street Baptist, on its Facebook page, Wednesday evening thanked people for their prayers. ""We know that God is in control and we need His comfort and peace,"" a post read. A photo from CNN affiliate WVLT showed smoke rising from the scene and debris along the highway. I-40 was closed, and traffic was being rerouted, according to state transportation officials. The scene is expected to be cleared early Thursday morning. Investigators will look at the condition of the bus and check the driver's qualifications and driving history, according to Miller.

"(CNN) -- Issac is expected to move over Arkansas on Friday and over southern Missouri Friday night after lingering over the Louisiana area dumping heavy rains for days. After making landfall on Tuesday night as a powerful Category 1 hurricane, Issac has weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm than a tropical depression. It came virtually on the same day, seven years after Katrina devastated Louisiana and for some Issac felt too much like the deadly hurricane that is blamed for the deaths of 1,800 people. ""This is unbelievable. Deja vu, man,"" said Billy Nungesser, the president of Plaquemines Parish, Thursday as he surveyed the hard-hit town of Ironton that was inundated by floodwaters and sludge. ""There is more water here than Katrina."" But for the many that braced for the worse and were spared, Friday is a day to breath a sigh of relief and to continue to clean up the mess Issac left behind. State government offices in at least 13 parishes would remained closed Friday because of flooding and most others would reopen, CNN affiliate WBRZ reported. Emergency crews were also trying to restore power to many. More than 827,000 customers -- down from 915,000 earlier in the day -- had no electricity across Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, utility companies reported Thursday. One company, Coast Electric Power, reduced a high of 30,000 outages to 8,000 by Thursday evening . The bodies of a man and woman were found in 7 feet of water at a home in Plaquemines Parish, officials said late Thursday. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of the death of the couple, described as being their 40s, Nungesser told CNN. The two were found late Thursday afternoon in the home's kitchen. The house is on the parish's East Bank, said Commander Terry Rutherford of the Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Office. Officials also intentionally breached a levee in Plaquemines Parish, southeast of New Orleans. The move was needed to help drain floodwaters in the Braithwaite and Scarsdale communities. In Tangipahoa, Parish President Gordon Burgess called for a mandatory evacuation for those living within a half mile of the Tangipahoa River. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the move was a precaution because if the dam were to break it would only take 90 minutes for floodwaters to get to Kentwood, a town of about 2,200 residents. Later Thursday, Burgess said he did not know how many people had been evacuated along the 54-mile stretch of the river. Kentwood saw 75 people move. ""I'm feeling much more comfortable tonight and I'm going to sleep better tonight,"" Burgess said. The storm has had a ""major impact"" on Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant said in Gulfport said Thursday. Also officials in Mississippi earlier reported a storm-related death. A tow truck driver attempting to clear debris on a road was struck and killed by a falling tree, officials said. The incident took place at midnight, said Amanda Harris, deputy director of the Pearl River County Emergency Management office. The National Weather Service said it received reports of the fatality in Picayune. An earthen dam on 700-acre Lake Tangipahoa in Mississippi was holding its own and not leaking late Thursday, despite significant damage, according to the Pike County Emergency Management Agency. Agency director Richard Coghlan said a ""controlled breach"" or spillway will be created at the Percy Quin State Park lake to relieve pressure and drain it. Crews were working carefully overnight, moving in equipment to prepare for the operation expected to commence later Friday once water levels drop a bit. ""They don't want to influence the level of the river any more than they have to."" Residents of 19 houses and seven mobile homes, along with three businesses, below the lake were asked to evacuate. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency does not expect a catastrophic event, said spokesman Greg Flynn. Coghlan agreed with that assessment. Water levels in most affected areas will gradually subside Friday, the hurricane center said, concluding its reports on Isaac. Isaac moved into southern Arkansas Thursday afternoon, bringing with it the possibility of flash flooding and tornadoes. ""It's looking more disorganized but it is still putting out quite a bit of rain,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Charles Dalton in Little Rock. Rainfall around Little Rock could total 5 inches by Friday, said Dalton. Higher numbers were expected in the southeastern portion of Arkansas.

"(CNN) -- Red Bull driver Mark Webber has cast doubt on the Bahrain Grand Prix taking place this year, even though the race has been reinstated on the Formula One calendar. F1's ruling body the FIA announced on Friday that the gulf kingdom, which was supposed to stage the event in March at the start of the season, will hold it at the end of October. The FIA's decision came after its top officials visited the island on Tuesday, and the following day Bahrain's ruler lifted the state of emergency laws that had facilitated the restriction of political leaders and journalists. But Webber has joined the 12 F1 teams in refusing to back the move, which has outraged human rights groups around the world. Should F1 take the risk of racing in Bahrain? ""My opinion is unchanged since I was first asked about this in late February. Even though a decision has been made, I'll be highly surprised if the Bahrain Grand Prix goes ahead this year,"" the Australian told his personal website on Saturday. ""The sport should have taken a much firmer stance earlier this year rather than constantly delaying its decision in hope of being able to reschedule it in 2011. It would have sent a very clear message about F1's position on something as fundamental as human rights and how it deals with moral issues. ""It's obvious that the parties involved have struggled to reach a decision, but sadly I feel that they still haven't made the right one. Like it or not, F1 and sport in general isn't above having a social responsibility and conscience. I hope F1 is able to return to Bahrain eventually, but now isn't the right time."" Webber, who helped Red Bull win the manufacturers' title last year while teammate Sebastian Vettel claimed the drivers' championship, has been the only one of his peers to comment publicly on the situation in Bahrain. ""As a competitor I do not feel at all comfortable going there to compete in an event when, despite reassurances to the contrary, it seems inevitable that it will cause more tension for the people of that country,"" he said.

In other words, he's a bit like WALL-E, and Andrea Riseborough is his latter day Eve. They live in a billion-dollar birdhouse perched up above the clouds, and in a quaintly chauvinist set up, he reconnoiters the skies in a flashy starfighter prototype, while she sits at an interstellar telephone exchange and relays the commands of mission controller Sally (an irritatingly twangy Melissa Leo) from on high. See, the remainder of the human race has taken refuge on a giant spaceship (it looks like a floating audio speaker, something that wouldn't be out of place on the cover of an '80s progressive rock album). The plan is to scoot over to Saturn just as soon as they have sucked up enough hydropower from the Earth's oceans to fuel the journey. But why? Well, because of the alien invaders who destroyed the moon and threw the biosphere out of whack, that's why. As Cruise mournfully intones in the movie's lugubrious prologue, we won the war, but lost the planet. That's what the drones are for: to kill off the last remaining hostiles, or ""scavs,"" who have taken refuge on the edge of the radioactive wastelands that cover most of the globe. That's more than enough backstory, I know, but there's much more to come out, even as Jack goes about his daily routine, tracking down lost drones, revisiting ruined New York landmarks (the top of the Empire State Building now sits at ground level on a sea of dust), and occasionally going AWOL himself to grapple with fragmentary memories of a beautiful girl (Olga Kurylenko), and a lost world he has no right to remember. The story is officially credited to an unpublished comic book by the film's director, Joseph Kosinski. But if you poured all the most memorable sci-fi films from the past half century into a blender, from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the original ""Planet of the Apes"" all the way down to last year's ""Prometheus,"" you would probably wind up with something very similar and equally synthetic -- though quite possibly more exciting. While he immerses us in an often dazzling futurescape, for the most part Kosinski (""Tron: Legacy"") lacks the poetic imagination to animate this requiem for a dying world -- comparisons with ""WALL-E"" are certainly not to this film's advantage -- and fails to convince us that he genuinely cares about the fate of his characters, let alone the planet. The movie's few action scenes are competent but unlikely to wow any battle-seasoned gamers out there. Kosinski does produce one rabbit from his hat, a real surprise late in the game that sends the movie for a loop, but also undermines a good deal of the credibility he's worked hard to build up over the preceding hour and a half or so. Like ""Prometheus,"" this is another of those earnest, overdetermined spiritual allegories that falls apart in the rear-view mirror. It is certainly nice to look at though. Director of photography Claudio Miranda was last seen picking up an Academy Award for his breathtaking work on ""Life of Pi,"" and his images of an Earth turned to ash are almost as alluring. They're enough to lend the picture a sense of scope and even grandeur, but they can't paper over the cracks running right through its core. ""Oblivion"" shoots for the moon and falls short.","""Oblivion"" is a Tom Cruise sci-fi film; he stars as the last guy on Earth .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- ""Basat al reeh."" ""Dulab."" ""Falaqa."" They are Arabic names for torture techniques that send chills through the hearts of Syrians, particularly the untold thousands who are believed to have been detained during the uprising of the last 15 months. ""We suffered torture all the time,"" said Tariq, an opposition activist from the port city of Latakia who spent 40 days in solitary confinement in spring 2011. He told CNN he endured ""dulab,"" in which torturers force the prisoner's legs and head into a car tire before beating them, and ""basat al reeh,"" in which the prisoner is tied to a board and beaten. ""They threw cold water on our naked bodies and they also urinated on us ... they are really good at what they do,"" said Tariq, who now is in Turkey helping mobilize men and weapons to rebels inside Syria. According to a report published Tuesday by the New York-based human rights organization Human Rights Watch, the Syrian government has been carrying out ""a state policy of torture"" as part of an effort to crush dissent throughout the unrest. Human Rights Watch identified 27 detention centers across Syria where torture was systematically inflicted on prisoners, according to testimonies from more than 200 former prisoners and security officers who defected. Rights group cites 'state policy of torture' in Syria as stream of defectors reported . ""It is a network of torture chambers that the authorities are using to intimidate and punish people who dare to oppose the government,"" said Ole Solvang, a Human Rights Watch researcher. ""Nobody knows how many people are being detained, how many are being tortured,"" he added. ""But one local activist group has collected names of 25,000 people in detention. The numbers are absolutely staggering."" Human Rights Watch titled its report ""The Torture Archipelago"" in an overt attempt to link the Syrian prison system to the notorious Siberian gulags described in Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Soviet dissident novel ""The Gulag Archipelago."" The system is being run by at least four intelligence agencies collectively referred to as mukhabarat, or secret police, the report says. Those agencies include the Department of Military Intelligence, the Political Security Directorate, the General Intelligence Directorate and the Air Force Intelligence Directorate. ""The authorities also established numerous temporary unofficial holding centers in places such as stadiums, military bases, schools and hospitals where the authorities rounded up and held people during massive detention campaigns before transporting them to branches of the intelligence agencies,"" Human Rights Watch reported. The Syrian government routinely denies allegations of such abuses. Recently, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations walked out of a meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council in protest after the Syrian regime was accused of committing crimes against humanity. But the eyewitness accounts gathered by Human Rights Watch as well as by CNN throughout the 15-month crisis are overwhelming. Though most of the torture victims in Human Rights Watch's report were men ranging from 18 to 35 years of age, the organization also interviewed women, senior citizens and children who said they were tortured. ""They electrocuted me on my stomach, with a prod. I fell unconscious,"" said Hossam, a 13-year-old boy who told Human Rights Watch he was detained in the town of Tal Kalakh in May 2011. ""When they interrogated me the second time, they beat me and electrocuted me again. Clinton: World may not succeed in Syria . ""The third time, they had some pliers and they pulled out my toenail. They said, 'Remember this saying, always keep it in mind: We take both kids and adults, and we killed them both.' I started to cry, and they returned me to the cell."" CNN has also interviewed more than a dozen Syrians who described enduring beatings, electrocution and horribly crowded conditions in prison cells. A dentist who was arrested for secretly providing medical care to wounded demonstrators told CNN in February that he endured beatings, near-drownings in buckets of toilet water and electric shocks to his genitals during 45 days in a prison cell that was built for 60 people but held 130 prisoners. ""They started beating me and asked me, 'Who did you help?' "" the dentist recounted. ""I said, 'I helped an old lady.' Then they started beating me even harder."" The accounts of brutality match those shared by a former mukhabarat officer who said he was repeatedly ordered to torture prisoners until he defected and fled to Turkey with his family last year. ""Whatever we wanted the prisoner to say, he would say. Not what he wanted to say, whatever we ordered him to say,"" said the former officer, who spoke to CNN outside a refugee camp in Turkey where he had been living for months. ""We took their fingernails out with pliers and we made them eat them. We made them suck their own blood of the floor,"" the officer added. Photos: In Syrian hospital, no escape from war . The officer's descriptions of the detention facility where he worked in Damascus matched the descriptions of a former prisoner who had spent months incarcerated in the same building. That former prisoner's finger was still mangled after it was crushed during a torture session in the Damascus facility. The officer said prison guards used grim humor during their interrogation sessions. ""We would bring the prisoner and put him in the 'basat al reeh' or the 'dulab' and start beating him,"" he said. ""He would scream 'for God's sake,' and we would say OK, bring the 'for God's sake' stick. He would scream 'for my mother, please"" or 'for [the prophet] Mohammed.' And we would bring the 'my mother' stick and the 'for Mohammed' stick. Every stick had a name."" ""At the core, the crisis in Syria is about human rights violations,"" said Solvang, who has traveled into Syria to gather evidence and testimony for ""Torture Archipelago."" ""That is what is driving the crisis and driving people to take up arms."" The Human Rights Watch report includes satellite maps showing the exact location of detention centers. It also lists the names of commanders of individual detention centers. Human Rights Watch is urging the U.N. Security Council to refer Syrian officials to the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. ""Those who commit these abuses do so with complete impunity, thinking they will never have to answer for this,"" Solvang said. ""By publishing these names, we are really putting them on notice, saying they will have to answer for these violations.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles public school district has paid $27 million to settle 58 of 191 students' lawsuits alleging they were victims of sexually lewd acts by an elementary school teacher, a school spokesman said Tuesday. Two other lawsuits in the Miramonte Elementary School case have been settled but are pending court approval, said Sean Rossall, spokesman for the office of General Counsel's office for the Los Angeles Unified School District. The almost $27.3 million in payments works out to approximately $470,000 per child, according to the district. In March, David Holmquist, the district's general counsel, confirmed the settlements in 58 cases but declined to state the exact financial figure other than say the amount was in the ""multimillions."" At that time, Holmquist described the agreements as ""good settlements."" The students' claims were filed in the wake of charges against former Miramonte Elementary School teacher Mark Berndt, 62, who pleaded not guilty last year to allegations he put young students in bondage and then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and 3-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces. Berndt is being held on $23 million bail and faces 23 felony counts of lewd acts on a child. The 23 alleged victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has said. Several of the plaintiffs' attorneys couldn't say for certain in March whether any of the 23 alleged victims in the criminal case are among the 58 civil settlements.

"(CNN) -- A devastating storm system moved across the United States on Friday, spawning a slew of tornadoes that contributed to at least 28 fatalities in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. National Weather Service meteorologist John Gordon reported Friday afternoon the agency had about ""half a dozen reports of tornadoes on the ground,"" as well as reports of ""significant damage"" -- making his comments before some of the worst twisters were reported. ""This is an enormous outbreak that's going on right now across Kentucky and the South,"" Gordon said. ""It's crazy. It's just nuts right here."" Southern Indiana was particularly hard hit, with Indiana Department of Homeland Security spokesman John Erickson saying three had died in Jefferson County as a result. Sgt. Rod Russell with the Indiana State Police said later that three people also were killed in Scott County. In addition, Emergency Management Director Leslie Cavanaugh of Clark County -- which has about 110,000 people -- reported one death. Sheriff's Department Maj. Chuck Adams added that a man was found dead in his car several miles outside Henryville. ""We've got total devastation in the north-ceindntral part of the county (and) widespread damage from the west to the east,"" added Adams. ""We are inundated with calls."" At least 15 people were killed across Indiana, authorities said. Aerial footage from CNN affiliate WLKY showed structures torn to shreds and large swaths of trees knocked down in Henryville, about 20 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. Other aerial images showed similar devastation in St. Paul, Indiana. Several officials -- including Jeffersonville, Indiana, Mayor Mike Moore, U.S. Sen. Dan Coats and Adams -- indicated that the town of Marysville suffered especially significant damage. Cavanaugh also said that the local high school, Henryville Junior-Senior High School, had been ""demolished."" According to Sara Reschar, an administrative assistant for the West Clark Community Schools, ""students were already out of the school when the storm hit"" -- having been dismissed about 15 minutes earlier. Adams said there were some ""scrapes and scratches,"" but no serious injuries as a result. Authorities used thermal imaging equipment, search dogs and other means Friday night to look for a 9-year-old boy in Henryville whose whereabouts was unknown after the tornadoes came through, Adams said. Amid the devastation, there was also some hope -- in the form of a 20-month-old girl found alone, and without identification, in a field in Salem, about 20 miles from Henryville. Adam said the girl was intubated and then flown to Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville. He said that people since had called in to identify the girl, while adding he did not know her current condition. About four hours after the National Weather Service said a twister touched down in Indiana's Posey County, Gov. Mitch Daniels said crews ""are racing the nightfall"" to assess the damage and help those in need. Sgt. First Class Tina Eichenour of the Indiana National Guard said that roughly 250 troops have been called to duty, destined for towns such as Henryville and Marysville. ""I am constantly amazed by both the unpredictability and the ferocity that Mother Nature can unleash, when she chooses to,"" Daniels said of the severe weather. His counterpart in Kentucky, Gov. Steve Beshear, on Friday declared a statewide emergency to facilitate local authorities' access to state resources. The governor has authorized the deployment of 50 National Guard troops to go to Morgan County to join a 12-person search and rescue team out of Lexington. What to do during tornado watches, warnings . ""The storm system hasn't cleared Kentucky yet, but we obviously have reports of some heavy damage,"" Beshear told CNN's Erin Burnett. At least 12 people were killed in Kentucky tied to Friday's severe weather, authorities said. Shawn Harley, from the National Weather Service, confirmed that people were trapped in damaged buildings after a large tornado struck the small town of West Liberty in eastern Kentucky. There was no immediate word on casualties as a result. Chuck Wolfe, a spokesman for the Kentucky Emergency Management Agency, said state authorities had lost contact with the town. Wolfe said officials believe the town ""got hit pretty heavily."" Beshear is expected to visit West Liberty to assess the damage Saturday. Separately, a man in his 50s was found dead in his mobile home in Bethel, Ohio, the Clermont County Commissioners said in a press release. In Tennessee, severe weather was responsible for critical injuries of as many as eight people in the cities of Harrison and Oolteweh, officials there said. The storm brought golf-ball-size hail, strong winds and rain into the two northeast Alabama counties before continuing on a northeastward path into Tennessee. Tennessee Emergency Management spokesman Jeremy Heidt said there were reports of possible tornado touchdowns in nine counties total. At least 29 people were injured across the state, according to Dean Flener, also with TEMA. Between 40 and 50 homes in Hamilton County, Tennessee, have ""significant damage that we know about,"" the county's Chief of Emergency Management Bill Tittle told CNN. Reporting from that area near Chattanooga, CNN's Rob Marciano observed a continuous stretch of damage about 200 yards wide that ripped what had been brick-and-mortar homes down to their foundations. Tittle said that there are 24 reported injuries and, while none of them appears to be life-threatening, he acknowledged that ""we have not reached all the homes."" ""We obviously have lots of debris, homes with roof damage, streets that are impassable that we have crews cutting down trees with chainsaws in order to get emergency vehicles through, and as of now our crews are just going door-to-door on foot,"" said Amy Maxwell, Hamilton County, Tennessee, emergency management spokeswoman. Maxwell later said six to 10 people were at local hospitals after suffering injuries, and a triage area was set up at Ooltewah High School to treat patients on the scene. Hamilton County Mayor Jim Coppinger said a touchdown of a tornado had been confirmed, though he expressed optimism that sound preparation and safety measures appeared thus far to prevent any deaths. ""We're just working diligently at this hour to try to make sure that everyone is accounted for,"" Coppinger told CNN. ""And hopefully we'll be able to escape (without fatalities)."" Meanwhile, Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said there have been seven injuries and about 40 homes destroyed but no fatalities after two tornadoes touched down in his state Friday morning. This Just In: Harrisburg's path of destruction . ""The April 27 tornado and the track of the two this morning were exactly the same,"" Bentley told CNN, referring to last year's twisters that left at least 238 dead. Both Buckhorn High School in Madison County and the Limestone County Correctional Facility in an adjacent Alabama county were hit Friday. There was also widespread damage in Madison County, the National Weather Service said, and some injuries were reported, according to a local ambulance service. The Madison County Emergency Management Agency confirmed that a rain-wrapped tornado was spotted near the Harvest area, just northwest of Huntsville, which itself was hit hard by a tornado last year. Toddler found alone in field . ""The key thing that let me know it was serious was the loud wind,"" said Hovet Dixon of Harvey, Alabama. ""It almost seemed like it was trying to lift my roof off."" The warden for the Limestone Correctional Facility, Dorothy Goode, said the prison was hit by the storm. All prisoners -- the facility holds about 2,200 -- were accounted for, she said. Storms are expected to begin to weaken during the late evening as they move east toward the Appalachians. The severe weather threat should diminish overnight Friday into Saturday morning, Morris said. These tornadoes follow an earlier outbreak that began Tuesday night and left 13 dead across Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee and battered parts of Kentucky.

"(CNN) -- Twenty-two Carnival Cruise Lines passengers were robbed of valuables and their passports during a shore excursion in the Mexico seaside resort of Puerto Vallarta, cruise officials said late Saturday. The passengers were robbed Thursday during a guided trail excursion, according to a statement released by the cruise line. The cruise line did not provide details of the robbery, saying only that there were no injuries and the tour was suspended on future sailings under further notice. ""Carnival is working with guests to reimburse them for lost valuables and assist with lost passports or other forms of identification,"" the statement said. The robbery comes two weeks after the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning to Americans to avoid all but essential travel to all or parts of 14 Mexican states, including the state of Jalisco. Puerto Vallarta is the sixth-largest city in Jalisco. The State Department also warned travelers to use caution in visiting part of Baja California, Colima and Morelos. The 3,000-plus passenger Carnival Splendor set sail February 19 from Long Beach, California, for a seven-day Mexican Riviera cruise that included stops in Cabo San Lucas and Puerto Vallarta, according to the ship's online itinerary. The travel warnings and reports of increasing violence in Mexico have caused many cruise lines to curb their itineraries, either eliminating and shortening stops. A number of cruise lines dropped Mazatlan from itineraries last year following a spike in violence. Puerto Vallarta has remained a tourism hotspot, drawing college students during Spring vacations as well as cruise passengers. The travel warnings follow reports that more than 47,500 people were killed in drug-related violence in Mexico between December 2006 and September 2011, according to the State Department. While most of those murdered were involved in criminal activity, innocent people were also caught in the crossfire, the State Department said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared a crackdown on cartels in late 2006.

"(CNN) -- Andrea Pirlo played a starring role against his former club AC Milan to keep Italian champion Juventus in touch with the Serie A leaders Sunday. The veteran midfielder scored a free-kick and hit the bar with another, allowing Giorgio Chiellini to volley what would be the decisive goal for a 3-1 lead. AC Milan, down to 10 men by that stage after defender Philippe Mexes was sent off for protesting his initial booking, reduced the deficit through Sulley Muntari's second of the match at the end. It left Juve in third place on goal difference behind Napoli, which also remained unbeaten following a 4-0 win at home to Livorno. Both clubs trail Roma by two points, following the capital club's Saturday win at Inter Milan. Former Inter midfielder Muntari gave Milan the lead inside 30 seconds, but Pirlo -- who spent a decade at the San Siro -- equalized after 15 minutes with a set-piece that goalkeeper Christian Abbiati could only deflect into the net. Substitute Sebastian Giovinco put Juve ahead in the 69th minute from Arturo Vidal's pass, soon after his arrival on the pitch, and then Mexes' moment of madness was to prove vital for Milan as Chiellini immediately capitalized. The defeat left the seven-time European champion languishing in 12th place, some 13 points adrift of Roma. Napoli, like Juve, has six wins and a draw from seven matches, continuing new coach Rafael Benitez's fine start. Former Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Higuain was again missing due to injury, but the Neapolitans had too much firepower for Livorno. Striker Goran Pandez followed up last weekend's double against Genoa with another goal, while midfielder Gokhan Inler's speculative long-range shot went through keeper Francesco Bardi before Jose Callejon and Marek Hamsik netted in the second half. Verona moved up to fifth with a 4-1 win at Bologna, climbing above Fiorentina and Lazio -- who drew 0-0 in Rome. Udinese claimed eighth with a 2-0 win at home to Cagliari, while Alessio Cerci went top of the Serie A scoring charts with a penalty in ninth-placed Torino's 2-2 draw at Sampdoria. The Italy winger now has six goals, putting him one ahead of Hamsik and Fiorentina's Giuseppe Rossi. In Spain, Diego Costa moved to the top of the La Liga scoring charts with both goals in Atletico Madrid's 2-1 win over Celta Vigo on Sunday. The Brazil-born striker, who is hoping to qualify to play for his adopted country, moved two clear of Barcelona's Lionel Messi on 10 goals but could have had more after missing a first-half penalty. Atletico kept pace with Barca, as both clubs have eight wins from eight this season. Getafe moved up to fifth place with a 3-1 win at home to Real Betis, as winger Pedro Leon scored twice in the first 22 minutes before striker Adrian Colunga added another soon after. Athletic Bilbao and Valencia also have 13 points following a 1-1 draw in the Basque capital, but trail Getafe on goal difference. Sevilla moved away from the relegation with a 2-1 win over bottom club Almeria. In France, defending champion Paris Saint-Germain kept level on points with this season's leader Monaco after battling to a 2-1 win at third-placed Marseille. PSG had Thiago Motta sent off for a foul that allowed Andre Ayew to net a 34th-minute penalty, but equalized on halftime through Maxwell's header. Zlatan Ibrahimovic then scored a second-half spotkick after Ayew fouled Marquinhos, extending his team's unbeaten run to 20 league matches. In Germany, Hamburg moved out of the Bundesliga's bottom three with a 5-0 win at Nuremberg to give former Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk his first win since taking charge. Germany under-21 striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga netted a hat-trick in eight second-half minutes. Bottom club Freiburg came from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt.","Juventus and Napoli two points behind Serie A leader Roma after victories on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Boutonnieres, photographers, smiles and tears of joy -- requisite wedding fixtures -- abounded Sunday at Seattle's City Hall. But for 133 couples, the day's fanfare brought an extra dimension. After exchanging vows at five stations set up in City Hall, they walked outside and down rain-slickened steps, greeted by cheers, confetti and a brass band celebrating the first day same-sex couples could marry in Washington. ""Today was really about the state of Washington recognizing us,"" said Robin Wyss, who married Danielle Yung, her partner of eight years. ""People beyond our close friends and family saying our family is as valid as any other family."" After years of saying no at the ballot box, American voters for the first time said yes to same-sex marriage this fall in Washington, Maryland and Maine. The couples married Sunday in Seattle were among the first such couples in Washington to obtain marriage licenses Thursday. ""You are seeing all generations here, people fighting for equality for decades,"" Aaron Pickus, press secretary to Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn, told CNN. ""It's a very happy day."" Local businesses provided refreshments. Musicians and photographers volunteered their services, Pickus said. A city website featured interviews with couples, photos, live webcams and information on obtaining a marriage license. Keith Bacon, 44, and Corianton Hale, 34, of West Seattle were among those tying the knot in simultaneous services. ""After a commitment ceremony (this past summer) we just thought we would go down to City Hall, fill out paperwork and call it good,"" said Bacon. ""(Today) you would hear bursts of applause. It was very festive and joyous, kind of an electric feeling in the air. "" Bacon and Wyss expressed hope that the U.S. Supreme Court will issue rulings favorable to same-sex marriage. On Friday, the justices said they will hear two constitutional challenges to state and federal laws dealing with the recognition of gay and lesbian couples to legally wed. Oral arguments will likely be held in March with a ruling by late June. One appeal to be heard involves the federal Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA, which denies federal benefits to same-sex couples legally married in their own state. The second is a challenge to California's Proposition 8, a voter-approved referendum that took away the right of same sex-marriage that previously had been approved by the state's courts. Before November's vote, couples in Washington had domestic partner rights. Bacon and Wyss said they now feel full equality. ""Just being able to say Corianton is my husband, not just my partner,"" Bacon told CNN. Approval of same-sex marriage in Washington contrasts with the 38 states that have passed bans on marriages between people of the same sex, mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. In six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia, gays and lesbians have previously won marriage rights because of actions taken by judges or legislators, not voters. A milestone also occurred this year in the nation's executive branch: President Barack Obama became the first president to openly support same-sex marriage. These political trends emerged as a majority of Americans say they support legally recognizing same-sex marriage at a time when the public demonstrates increasing comfort with gays and lesbians, according to a CNN/ORC International survey in June. Bacon said he and Hale have had to deal with acceptance among some family members. ""We're in a great place, but it took awhile."" ""I feel like we made history today, and I like the way history is going,"" said Bacon. CNN's Michael Martinez and Bill Mears contributed to this report.","133 same-sex couples are married Sunday at Seattle City Hall .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Federal and state health officials are investigating a salmonella outbreak in 19 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC reports 93 people in 19 states and the District of Columbia have been sickened by an unusual strain of the bacteria called salmonella Bareilly. So far 10 people have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported, according to health officials. The first case of this particular food-borne illness was reported on January 28. The most recent case was reported Monday. ""CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate outbreak of salmonella serotype Bareilly infections,"" CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said in a statement. News of the investigation surfaced late Tuesday when an internal memo was inadvertently sent to everyone at the FDA, according to FDA spokesman Curtis Allen. He says the memo speculates about a possible source of contamination -- sushi -- but he says the FDA doesn't know the origins of the outbreak at this time. According to the CDC, state public health officials are interviewing those who became ill to find out what they may have eaten and been exposed to in the week before they got sick. This is how investigations into food-borne illnesses are typically conducted. Russell said in ""initial interviews, many of the ill persons reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or similar foods in a variety of locations in the week before becoming ill."" However, it is still early in the investigation. According to the CDC, consumers are not being told to avoid any particular food or restaurants. Once a particular food is identified for this outbreak, the public will be notified, according to a CDC statement. Consumers are advised to contact their doctor if they believe they became ill from eating potentially contaminated food. Salmonella infections lead to diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps between 12 and 72 hours after someone is exposed to the bacteria, and the sickness can last from four to seven days, according to health officials. The oldest and youngest patients and those with a weakened immune system are the most likely to suffer severe complications from a salmonella infection. Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C. have reported cases linked to this outbreak. CDC officials say the investigation into the cause of the outbreak is ongoing and ""if a specific food source is identified for this outbreak, public health officials will alert the public and take further steps to prevent additional illnesses.""","CDC reports 93 people in 19 states and the District of Columbia have become ill .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of white supremacist groups are active in the United States today and are experiencing a kind of resurgence, experts say. They are in the spotlight this week in the wake of a deadly shooting at a Sikh temple outside Milwaukee. Authorities have said they are looking into whether the gunman, who was killed, had ties to such a group. Who are Sikhs? ""I know they're out there. I try not to alarm the public too much, but it's something that really needs to be taken a hold of now because more and more we see facts coming out that this is happening more often and more often, and it's not going to stop anytime soon,"" said David Gletty, who worked as an undercover informant on extremist groups for the FBI. Currently, there are more than 1,000 hate groups in the United States, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks them and says it was tracking the Wisconsin gunman for years before the attack. Wade Michael Page, 40, was a ""frustrated neo-Nazi,"" said the center. His tattoos included the Celtic cross adopted by white supremacist groups, and he was a member of two ""racist skinhead"" bands, it said. In addition, he was associated with Hammerskin Nation, according to Mark Potok, director of the center. ""Hammerskins are the scariest, most violent skinhead group out there. So Page was in the middle of a scene that really was very violent, hyperpolitical. And he was not on the fringes of this scene. He was really in the thick of it."" On its website, Hammerskin Nation says it is ""a leaderless group of men and women who have adopted the White Power Skinhead lifestyle."" It adds, ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White Children."" Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University in Boston, pointed to several factors behind the strength of white supremacist groups, including a flagging economy and the election of the country's first black president. ""During tough economic times, the credibility of mainstream, conventional institutions and leaders declines dramatically and what happens is that more and more Americans have given up resolving their problems in the middle and have gone to the extremes,"" he said. Remembering the shooting victims . But there's a twist. While the number of white supremacist groups is rising, the overall impact on membership is not clear, said Levin. That's because the groups, while there are more of them, are smaller, he said, adding that their splintering makes the cells more dangerous and difficult to disrupt. ""It's harder for the FBI to find an informant. It's more difficult for them to infiltrate. A small number of good friends can do incredible damage,"" said Levin. Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research at the Anti-Defamation League, said right-wing extremism is experiencing a resurgence. But to grow, white supremacist groups have to buck a long-term trend toward inclusion, he said. ""For the white supremacist movement to expand, that's swimming upstream."" A kinder, gentler KKK? And that's hard. According to Levin and Gletty, one of the principal ways the groups recruit is through far-right music. ""The music is a very creative tool and a very important tool for bringing in the youth. They bring in these kids that are on the outskirts of society that feel rejected by society ... They brainwash them into believing that hate is the way to go and following them is the only way to go,"" said Gletty. ""There are many teenagers who commit what I would call thrill hate crimes,"" said Levin. ""Often, they're inspired by the white power rock lyrics and the literature of white power groups. They may not themselves be members of these organizations, but they are influenced by them."" In such a way, white supremacist groups can have an impact greater than their numbers. ""We have 300 million (people) in this country, so even the fringe of the fringe is a lot of folks,"" said Pitcavage. Potok said he believes that in the coming months and years, ""We are looking at the very real possibility of more domestic terrorism along these lines. We've seen it in Europe as well as here. I think this is accelerating, not decelerating.""","NEW: Page was associated with ""the scariest, most violent skinhead group,"" the director of the SPLC says .

"(CNN) -- Katt Williams' aggressive behavior at a Seattle bar and an odd exchange with police landed the comedian in jail Sunday, police said. Williams ""exchanged words with patrons in the bar, brandished a pool cue at a bar manager and refused to leave the business,"" and later refused to show identification to a police officer who had been called to the scene, a Seattle police news release said. The 41-year-old comic, who was in Seattle to perform his stand-up comedy show over the weekend, was booked into the King County jail on charges of assault, harassment and obstruction, police said. He was released on bond Monday morning, a jail official said. CNN requests for comment from Williams and his representative have not been answered. Officer Michael Virgilio wrote in his report that he responded to a call for police help at the World Sports Bar Sunday afternoon. The manager told him that Williams had returned to the bar after being involved in a dispute with a customer the night before, Virgilio said in his arrest report. ""I suppose you're going to ask me to take my hands out of my pockets, huh?"" Williams said to Virgilio, according to the report. Williams refused to give his name or show an ID, but ""yelled out a (California) driver's license number,"" the officer wrote. When Virgilio warned he would arrest him for obstruction unless he produced an ID, Williams responded ""No."" The comedian then turned around and placed his hands behind his back ""on his own accord,"" the arrest report said. ""Two of Williams' associates were standing nearby and were pleading for Williams to calm down,"" the officer wrote. While being handcuffed and searched, Williams ""made several comments about how he was going to sue the department,"" the report said. ""He stated he had been arrested over 30 times in the last few months and every time he was released prior to being booked into jail,"" Virgilio wrote. ""He made comments regarding my employment with the city of Seattle and how it would end as a result of his arrest. Williams stated he had millions of dollars and this arrest would not affect him."" After the search turned up Williams' passport in his pocket, the officer asked why he hadn't just handed it over. ""You asked for my driver's license,"" he quoted Williams saying. ""I didn't have it!"" Then, it got worse, the arrest report said. ""Williams became aggressive and resistant and his actions forced me to take him to the ground for a short period of time. He was subsequently placed in the back of my patrol car."" Williams was playing pool in the bar when Sunday's trouble started, the report said. ""An argument began and quickly escalated."" When the manager tried to separate Williams from the couple with whom he was arguing, Williams yelled at him for ""protecting the customers from the famous guy,"" Virgilio wrote. ""Williams picked up a pool stick, raised it up and pointed it at (the mananger's) face,"" the report said. ""(The mananger) continued to state if he hadn't stepped back the stick would have hit in the the face."" When the manager asked him to put the stick down, Williams said ""What if I don't?"" and jabbed the stick toward him again, the report said. ""At one point during the altercation, Williams followed a family outside of the bar where, as the family got into their car, Williams flicked a cigarette through a car window at a woman, striking her just below her eye,"" the police news release said. ""Williams also threw a rock at the family's car."" Officer Virgilio said he would request additional charges against Williams, including reckless endangerment, because the rock hit a window in the family's car, ""directly next to an 8-year-old girl."" ""Had the glass shattered or the rock had penetrated the window it could have struck and harmed the 8-year-old victim,"" he said. Williams began his career as a stand-up comic, gaining attention in 1999 for comedy club appearances. Television appearances on the BET network led to more success. His 2006 HBO special ""Katt Williams: Pimp Chronicles Pt.1"" raised his profile to a higher level. He has acted in several movies, including Eddie Murphy's ""Norbit,"" and his voice is featured in several popular cartoons, including ""The Boondocks."" His often-raunchy style has drawn comparisons to comedy legend Richard Pryor. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Katt Williams was first arrested for refusing to give police his ID, police say .

"(CNN) -- Iran flaunted a new generation of centrifuges and mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle Wednesday as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, clad in a white lab coat, was on hand to load domestically made fuel rods into the core of a Tehran reactor. Also announced was an intent to start production of yellowcake, a chemically treated form of uranium ore used for making enriched uranium. United Nations sanctions ban Iran from importing yellowcake. Domestic production would further Iran's nuclear self-sufficiency. In a speech outlining the latest developments, Ahmadinejad said Iran was willing to share its nuclear knowledge with other nations that subscribe to the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The U.S. State Department, however, dismissed Iran's announcements as bluster for a domestic audience. ""We frankly don't see a lot new here. This is not big news,"" said spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. ""In fact, it seems to have been hyped. The Iranians for many months have been putting out calendars of accomplishments and based on their own calendars they are many, many months behind. State-run Press TV broadcast live images of the Tehran event, hailed by the Iranians as a major scientific advancement for the Islamic republic. The first Iranian nuclear fuel rods, produced by Iranian scientists at the Natanz facility in central Iran, are to be used at the Tehran Nuclear Research Center, which Iran says is used primarily for medical purposes. The Tehran facility creates radio isotopes used for cancer treatment, Press TV reported, adding that 850,000 cancer patients were in dire need. Ahmadinejad had announced in a speech marking the 33rd anniversary of the Iranian revolution last week that Iran would be unveiling something big. Wednesday, he lashed out once again at Western powers who, he said, attempt to monopolize nuclear technology and prevent other nations from acquiring a key energy source. Ahmadinejad, surrounded by photos of assassinated Iranian nuclear scientists, said Iran has shown up the West. Tehran's latest activities have spiked tensions with Western powers, which believe Iran's atomic ambitions are focused on building a bomb. ""I am not so worried about the fuel issue but I am worried about the advanced centrifuges,"" said Arnie Gundersen, chief energy adviser with the nuclear consulting group Fairewindes Associates. ""If they are better, (Iran) can make enriched uranium faster,"" he said. Nuclear power plants use uranium that is enriched to 5%, Gundersen said. Making a nuclear bomb requires uranium to be enriched 20% or more, he said. That means the centrifuge must spin at 50,000 revolutions per minute for a longer amount of time. A more sophisticated centrifuge would make the process easier, Gundersen said. ""To be able to make any centrifuge, let alone a high-speed centrifuge, is technologically a very substantial step,"" he said. A November IAEA report found ""credible"" information that Tehran has carried out work toward nuclear weapons -- including tests of possible bomb components. Subsequent punitive measures against Iran have disrupted its economy. In response to the latest European Union sanctions on the energy and banking sectors, Iran is cutting oil exports to six European countries: the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France, Greece and Portugal, Press TV reported Wednesday. Despite Iran's drift away from the international community, Tehran's leaders have refused to bow down, insisting its nuclear program is intended for civilian energy purposes. In January 2008, the semi-official Fars news agency reported that Iran was able to produce everything it needs for the nuclear fuel cycle, making its nuclear program self-sufficient. But it was not clear that Tehran actually had the technology to turn enriched uranium into fuel rods. Then, last month, Iran said it had succeeded in building and testing a nuclear fuel rod, or a stack of low-enriched uranium pellets bundled together at the core of a nuclear reactor. The IAEA's governing council has adopted a resolution expressing ""deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear program."" Iran called the November IAEA report a fabrication aimed at bolstering U.S. accusations that Iran is working toward making a bomb. ""We will never ever suspend our enrichment,"" Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's permanent envoy to the IAEA, said in November.","NEW: The State Department dismisses Iran's announcements as bluster .

"London (CNN) -- Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder once said to me, in the margins of a European summit: ""There must be something weird about Britain that you have the press you have."" There is. Also, as I said to the Leveson Inquiry into the practices and standards of the British press set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, one of Rupert Murdoch's Australian editors once said to me: ""The British papers are the best in the world, and the worst in the world, sometimes in the same edition."" That was an astute observation too. Rupert Murdoch's titles drew most of the fire in the Leveson Inquiry, which also heard outrageous examples of how certain sections of the British newspaper industry treated both the powerful and the weak with contempt, and there are several court cases outstanding as a result of allegations of criminal activity. In the wake of the inquiry many commentators -- and newspaper owners -- argued that any regulation that came out of it would have terrible implications for free speech in Britain. Despite concern among ordinary readers that much of Fleet Street is out of control, the government has yet to introduce formally the independent self-regulation of the newspaper industry recommended by Leveson. This week the Privy Council meets to decide on a course of action. You'd have thought on that basis the press, if only for its own tactical reasons, might at least curb its worst excesses while that process reaches its conclusion, if not even learn the lessons of the public revulsion that accompanied what emerged at the inquiry. But you'd be wrong. Two years ago it was Murdoch's News International that was up to no good. Now the Daily Mail is at the center of a storm as a debate rages following its publication of an article about Labour leader Ed Miliband's father headlined ""The Man Who Hated Britain."" The story was accompanied on the website by a picture -- later removed -- of Miliband Senior's burial plot captioned ""grave socialist."" The Mail is certainly commercially successful, one of the few papers still to be selling in good numbers, and now with the most visited newspaper website in the world. But many people in public life -- along with campaigners who protested outside the Mail's offices in West London -- now view the Mail Group itself as the worst polluter of standards and debaser of public life, something I have argued for many years. One or two people -- though far fewer than those who have supported my attacks on him -- feel I have gone over the top in describing editor-in-chief Paul Dacre as the biggest poison in British public life, a bully, a hypocrite and a coward who won't even defend his actions in public. He is all of those things. Even in his ludicrous attempts to get lackeys and minions out on TV justifying the attack on Miliband's dead father, he has claimed the Labour leader wants ""state control"" of the press and ""politicians to decide what goes in newspapers."" That is the opposite of what Miliband said to the Leveson Inquiry. Other editors are furious at Dacre's tactical ineptitude, fearing that one possible consequence of the Mail's vicious attack on Miliband may be to bring about tougher regulation of Britain's press. In fact I think the politicians have sufficient commitment to freedom of the press not to allow this vicious row to sidetrack them from seeking to implement the kind of system both press and public can support. But what is clear is that it cannot have the bellowing voice of Dacre's papers setting the agenda. I last spoke to Dacre in the last century, when I realised there was no point even trying to have reasonable or rational debate with him. As Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg pointed out last week, it is not just Labour that Dacre hates, he hates anyone and anything that does not fit with his narrow, twisted and in my view sociopathic view of the world. The forefathers of the Daily Mail's owner, Jonathan Harmsworth, supported Adolf Hitler, and congratulated the Nazi leader on his annexation of Czechoslovakia. Today's Mail says this is irrelevant. Yet the basis on which they wrote a piece headlined ""the man who hated Britain"" was something Miliband's dad wrote in his diary when he was 17. Yet again, one rule for them, another for everyone else. Like when they complained on Wednesday that TV reporters were doorstepping their staff. Irony does not do this justice. On Sunday, it was also alleged the paper is owned through off-shore funds based in tax havens. So much for backing Britain! When the Mail on Sunday was forced to issue an apology for their gate-crashing of a private memorial event for Ed Miliband's uncle this week, the editor said it was totally at odds with the values and practices of the paper. On the contrary it is totally consistent. They have operated like this for years. As for Dacre, his career and his reputation are ending where I always knew basic British decency would ensure they would -- in the gutter to which he has dragged British journalism. Paul Dacre and the Daily Mail have not replied to CNN's request for comment. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alastair Campbell.","This week regulation of Britain's newspaper industry is back in the spotlight .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Two major hospital chains paid illegal kickbacks to clinics in order to treat undocumented immigrants at their facilities, a federal whistle-blower lawsuit alleges. Health Management Associates and Tenet Healthcare are accused of paying clinics to recruit undocumented pregnant women, then filing fraudulent Medicaid claims after treating them. The lawsuit was filed by HMA's former chief financial officer and unsealed Wednesday in federal court in Athens, Georgia. It alleges violations of anti-kickback statutes by the hospital companies, pointing to contracts between them and Hispanic Medical Management, which operates clinics around the Atlanta metropolitan area known as ""Clinica de la Mama."" ""By knowingly entering these contracts with the purpose of receiving patient referral services, defendant hospitals violated federal and state law and submitted false certification to the State Medicaid program that they were in compliance with such federal and state laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statue,"" the lawsuit says. That, according to the lawsuit, led to the state paying ""tens of thousands of ineligible Medicaid claims over the course of a decade."" The state of Georgia has joined the lawsuit. Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said he wants to recover state Medicaid funds. ""These hospitals allegedly paid Clinica kickbacks camouflaged as interpreter service payments to funnel emergency Medicaid patients their way and increase their bottom line,"" he said in a written statement. The alleged scheme came to light after former HMA CFO Ralph Williams flagged the contracts with Clinica to his supervisors. ""To me it was pay for patients, pure and simple. I said, 'This is an illegal agreement. It is a kickback situation,'"" Williams told CNN affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta. He said he was eventually fired and filed a whistle-blower lawsuit. Tenet Healthcare operates 49 hospitals nationwide, five of which are in Georgia. Health Management Associates operates more than 70 hospitals, three of which are located in Georgia. In a statement, Tenet Healthcare defended the contracts. ""We believe the agreements...were appropriate and provided substantial benefit to women in underserved Hispanic communities served by those hospitals. The services provided under these agreements included translation, determination of Medicaid eligibility, and other services designed to improve the delivery of obstetric care and increase the likelihood of a safe birth and a healthy baby,"" the statement said. ""These services are important to addressing the healthcare gaps that affect many Hispanic patients and other minority communities."" Heather Vizena from the marketing department of HMA said the company does not comment on pending litigation. Calls to one number listed for Hispanic Medical Management were answered by a person claiming the clinic had new ownership and a new name. Calls to other numbers were unanswered. Hospitals can file Medicaid claims for emergency services provided to undocumented immigrants, including childbirth. Kickbacks for patient referrals are prohibited under the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Congress adjourned for the summer on Thursday without passing a relief package for farmers and ranchers suffering through the most widespread drought since the 1930s. The only thing the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Democratic-controlled Senate have agreed on is that they'll take the issue up again after Labor Day. ""We need drought assistance, but instead we're just going to sit here in gridlock,"" said Jess Peterson, executive vice president of the U.S. Cattlemen's Association. ""It's kind of disappointing."" Little hope for worsening drought in U.S. Plains . Most farmers devastated by the drought are getting help from federally assisted insurance policies. But a number of livestock producers are in serious trouble. Why? A decision by Congress four years ago to pass a five-year farm bill that eliminated key federal livestock support programs in 2012 instead of 2013. Congress ""had it expire because they wanted the gimmick to keep the cost of the last farm bill down,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense. Now, in the midst of a brutal drought, ""it turned around and really bit them in the behind."" Feeling pressure to do something before leaving Washington for the summer, House GOP leaders managed to pass a narrowly tailored $383 million disaster relief bill restoring expired programs for livestock, certain trees, honeybees and farm-raised fish. The measure, funded by cutting spending on conservation programs, passed in a 223-197 vote. Thirty-five Democrats backed the measure, while 46 Republicans opposed it. Rank-and-file Democrats were quick to note that House Republicans came to power in the 2010 election promising reform, not fast fixes. More Congress: Congress closes loophole in stock trading law after CNN report . ""You want to hand (money) out to whoever comes to town and begs for it, go right ahead,"" said Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colorado. ""I have some rooftop terrace restaurants in my district. Give them some while you're at it. That's not a solution (to) the underlying problem."" In June, the Senate passed a comprehensive new five-year farm bill renewing the livestock programs in question while cutting the deficit by roughly $23 billion. The bill cuts the deficit through reforms such as the replacement of direct payments to farmers with more taxpayer-subsidized crop insurance for farmers in need. The measure passed in a rare bipartisan 64-35 vote. The House GOP, however, remains sharply split on the merits of such a bill. A similar multiyear measure passed the House Agriculture Committee but has since stalled. Some tea party conservatives want to cut spending more deeply, while a number of Farm Belt Republicans -- fearing political vulnerability and constituent pressure -- continue to push hard for immediate federal relief for livestock producers. USDA: Drought has made more than half of U.S. counties disaster zones . ""Our livestock guys take just as much risk as any other farmer or rancher out there, and they need to have some kind of protection in situations like these,"" freshman Rep. Kristi Noem, R-South Dakota, told CNN. ""We can't gamble with people's lives and businesses."" Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, admitted this week that ""the House is pretty well divided"" on the issue. ""Frankly,"" he told reporters, ""I haven't seen (a majority of) 218 votes in the middle to pass a farm bill."" Senate Democrats, with the backing of groups such as the Cattlemen's Association, have shown little willingness to adopt the narrower House plan and abandon their multiyear farm measure. ""If we get out in the real world, that's not what we're hearing from farmers and ranchers,"" said Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan. ""They want us to get our job done. They want a five-year farm bill. They want us to address disaster assistance. I intend to do both."" Livestock producers caught in a Capitol crunch . Stressing the need to provide ""long-term certainty,"" Stabenow urged the House to pass a full farm bill and work out its differences with the Senate. She blasted House Republicans for ""trying to play politics."" For their part, consumers can count on rising food prices next year if Congress does nothing, Peterson told CNN. He urged the House to adopt a plan similar to the Senate's. The House approach is to ""kick the can"" down the road, he said. ""It's not how business should be conducted ... It's very shortsighted.""

"(CNN) -- This week, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a decision that sent shock waves around the world. The governmental agency banned the importation of Apple's older iPhones (before the 4S) and cellular iPads (before the third-generation iPad 4G) into the U.S. market. These devices were found to violate a Samsung patent necessary to connect with AT&T's cellular network. Simply put, if you're an AT&T customer, your phone is not a phone without a technology that Samsung owns. Customs officers will hold any Apple shipments coming from China in 60 days if they contain those older products unless an appeals court sides with Apple or President Barack Obama vetoes the order. The president has delegated this decision-making power to the U.S. trade representative, but obviously, he can still do what no U.S. president has done in decades. However, he shouldn't get mired in this particular battle. A veto would be consistent with a set of patent reform proposals the White House unveiled a few hours before the ITC's decision, which would make it harder to obtain such bans. But it would mean depriving Samsung of its most significant victory in a bitter legal spat with Apple and interfere in the intense two-horse race going on in the smartphone market. A veto would also snub a major U.S. trading partner and geopolitical ally: South Korea, where Samsung accounts for about a fifth of the national economy. The South Koreans would certainly cry foul over ""protectionism."" The good news for Apple is that most of the affected products are no longer on sale. The ones that are still being sold are Apple's lowest-priced entry-level offerings. As soon as Apple launches the iPhone 5S, the iPhone 5 will replace the 4S as the mid-priced product. The iPhone 4S, which is also safe, will then become the low-end iPhone. Until this happens, we're talking about 1% of Apple's sales -- less, actually, because AT&T can buy as many iPhone 4 and iPad 2 units over the next 60 days as it wants and sell them afterward. And customers still have different models from which to choose. But there's a bigger reason for concern. What Samsung dropped on those older Apple products is the patent equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and a U.S. government agency with court-like powers said: ""Yes, Samsung, you're in your right to use this lethal weapon, and we don't care that Apple claims it's been universally outlawed."" Next time someone -- not necessarily Samsung, which could even find itself on the receiving end -- will use patents of this kind, called standard-essential patents, to nuke products that jobs depend on and that customers will sorely miss. And next time could be a matter of months because various other ITC cases over standard-essential patents are pending and will come to judgment soon. That's the real concern. Not the iPhone 4. Why are standard-essential patents the equivalent of a nuclear weapon? Because there are industry standards that establish the use of certain techniques. Unless your phone and mine use the same standard, we can't give each other a call or send each other a photo because the devices we use won't understand each other. This is called interoperability -- working together. When companies get together and define a standard, they have to promise to use these patents only as parking meters, not as guns. Conventional patents, such as the ones Apple is suing Samsung over, don't raise the same issues. For example, Apple is suing Samsung over a feature called ""rubber-banding."" It's the iconic bounce-back effect when you scroll a list (such as your phone's address book) and reach the end. I like it, but if you have rubber-banding and I don't, we can still keep in touch. No nuclear threat there. Congress should work with the president and denuclearize the mobile patents wars by disallowing import bans over standard-essential patents. Now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Florian Mueller.","U.S. government agency gave Samsung a victory over Apple in patent dispute .

"(CNN) -- You can be forgiven for losing track of time the morning after a night 77 years in the making. ""Oh sorry, that's my alarm,"" says an apologetic Andy Murray as his alarm trills while being interviewed. ""That was the finals day time for getting up, 915am ... just for yesterday."" Yesterday was Sunday July 7 and the day which saw Murray secure his place in British sporting history. In the 24 hours between those two alarms going off, Murray's world irrevocably changed with his 6-4 7-5 6-4 win over over Novak Djokovic in straight sets ensuring he became Britain's first men's singles champion at Wimbledon since 1936. It had been the most energy-sapping three sets of his career, with the world No. 2 eventually beating the world No. 1 following three hours of brutal battle, but Murray didn't want to go to sleep. After waiting his entire career to win the title Britain had so wanted for nearly eight decades, the Scot was scared of waking up to discover it was all a dream.

The Scot won to clinch Olympic gold at London 2012 and the hearts of a jubilant British public began to soften towards a man that had arguably come up short in the popularity stakes when compared to another British tennis star -- the now retired -- Tim Henman. In September a first grand slam title promptly followed at the U.S. Open, as Murray beat Djokovic in five sets in New York. ""Last year was the toughest loss of my career,"" explained the 26-year-old Murray when asked about his defeat in last year's Wimbledon final. ""It was the first time I responded well from a grand slam defeat and the Olympics helped. ""That period after the Wimbledon final and the Olympics was probably the most important of my career because it could have gone the other way. I could have not recovered from it and it could have been a struggle but I worked hard. ""I said after the semifinal that Wimbledon is the pinnacle of the sport,"" added Murray, referring to his comments after his last four win over Jerzy Janowicz. ""To do it with all of the pressure and stuff was really tough, it took a lot out of me. I'm just glad I don't have to worry about it anymore."" Weight of expectation . Murray might have been worrying, but so to has the British public. Worrying about a Briton winning Wimbledon has been a national pastime. He is the country's sole male tennis star and his annual quest for grass-court glory grips millions of anxious fans. While the shouts of encouragement inside Centre Court can work in Murray's favor, the media interest and the weight of expectation can also be a monkey on his back. ""During the match you try to embrace the pressures, the emotions and the struggle you're going through out there,"" said Murray. ""You have to embrace the occasion, but it's not necessarily enjoyment. You enjoy the winning and the outcome. If you lose, you're incredibly disappointed."" It looked as if the pressure might just be too much for Murray in what proved to be the deciding game of an absorbing final. Murray, calm and composed, was 40-0 up with three championship points. Ever the competitor, Djokovic showed the spirit and skill which has led him to six grand slam titles by hitting back. A nation held its breath. ""In that moment it must have been hard for people to watch,"" admitted Murray, who saved three break points before Djokovic found the net and the celebrations kicked off. ""Last night I just saw the last game, it was tough to watch even though I knew the outcome,"" said the Scot. After such a momentous triumph, it is tempting to suggest Murray can rest on his laurels. But the man from Dunblane has more grand slams in his sights, starting with a return to the Big Apple at the end of August. ""For me it's been to gradual improve throughout my career,"" he answers. ""Year upon year just getting a little bit better and change a few things. ""I will have a rest now and get myself ready to defend the U.S. Open. It will be my first time trying to defend a grand slam title so it will be a new pressure for me, a new experience and I look forward to it."" He better keep that alarm on.","Andy Murray describes last year's Wimbledon defeat as ""worst of his career""

"Baltimore (CNN) -- Marcus Dixon refers to the tattoos on his face as the ""art of war"": an eye etched on his forehead, five stars down the left side of his face, and the words ""don't cry"" on his eyelids. The tattoos are permanent reminders of his past life as a drug dealer. Dixon got the tattoos, he said, to send a message to his enemies and the police to leave him alone. ""I had to create a character that no one would dare challenge,"" he said. But Dixon's mother and his best friend feared for his safety. They staged an intervention and convinced him to make a fresh start. Dixon stopped selling drugs and moved to Atlanta. But with a criminal record and no connections, he had a difficult time finding a job. After a few months, he moved back to Baltimore, dejected. ""I was at the lowest of my lows,"" he said. He also wasn't in contact with his two sons, which troubled him since his own father hadn't been involved in his life. ""I was confused, lost, and didn't have the slightest idea of how to be a good father,"" said Dixon, now 30. ""I didn't have examples that could guide me."" Dixon's outlook began to change, however, when he followed his mother's advice and went to the Center for Urban Families in Baltimore. There, he's gotten job training, life skills and support that have made him much more optimistic about his future. Since 1999, the center has helped thousands of Baltimore residents find jobs and enabled hundreds of fathers to become more responsible parents. ""What we want to do is get these people above ground and back into the mainstream,"" said Joe Jones, the nonprofit's founder and CEO. ""We help them get them jobs so they can pay taxes and child support."" Most men, like Dixon, walk through the center's doors because they need help finding a job. But Jones believes that jobs are just the first step. For him, the key to creating real change in Baltimore's troubled communities is ending what he calls ""the cycle of father absence."" ""If we don't crack the code of men having babies for whom they're not responsible for, all of our efforts to build a better Baltimore will be limited,"" said Jones, 57. ""We're there to create a pathway to help them to understand how to begin to take on that responsibility."" According to the 2012 American Community Survey just released by the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 19 million children across the country -- 26% -- are living without a father in the home. In Baltimore, among African-American children, the rate is 69%. Jones says many of the men he tries to help grew up without fathers themselves. He also knows that children who grow up without fathers are more likely to become teen parents, use drugs and commit crimes, according to the National Fatherhood Initiative. ""The one thing that is consistent with all these men is that they want to be involved with the lives of their children, but they just don't know how,"" Jones said. His nonprofit runs a Responsible Fatherhood program to give men the support and tools they need to become better parents and reverse the cycle. A large part of that is helping men with their financial responsibilities. Jones says you can't fix the problem of deadbeat dads unless you address that many of them are dead broke. In the four Baltimore ZIP Codes where Jones' nonprofit works, there are nearly 3,000 men who together owe more than $40 million in child support, according to the Maryland Department of Human Resources. When Dixon first came to the Center for Urban Families, he owed $47,000 in child support. The size of this debt discouraged him from seeking employment, he said, because it usually only paid minimum wage and most of his wages would be garnished. But a counselor at the center helped Dixon arrange a plan with Child Support Services, which forgave more than $30,000 of his debt as long as he stayed employed. The center also helped Dixon land a full-time job -- loading trucks on the overnight shift at a clothing warehouse -- so he could earn money while taking classes at Baltimore City Community College. Dixon, who now covers his tattoos with makeup every day, is six credits away from earning his associate's degree in general studies. He plans to apply to more colleges soon to study pharmacology and molecular sciences. Jones' program also teaches men that being a father is about more than finances. They are taught nurturing skills, such as how to change diapers and communicate with their kids. ""You have a group of men speaking about issues they are having about their children,"" Dixon said. ""That's unheard of. Men don't do that, especially black men in the neighborhoods that we come from. ""Without these meetings, I would not know how to be a father."" Dixon has now embraced his role as a dad. He recently filed for visitation rights with his eldest son, who is 10 years old, and he takes his younger son, age 3, to school at least three times a week. ""The first day I took him to school, I got the sense of fatherhood,"" Dixon said. ""It has made me feel (like) more of a man."" Jones knows firsthand the struggles Dixon endured and the satisfaction he feels from having turned his life around. It's a transformation he experienced himself. Jones grew up in Baltimore and remembers the day his own father left, when he was 9 years old. As a teenager, Jones became a heroin and cocaine addict and spent 17 years selling drugs and committing petty crimes to support his habit, spending time in and out of jail. Jones said his biggest regret is that when he was 21, he had a son who he didn't take responsibility for. In 1986, after being charged with multiple drug-related offenses, Jones decided to turn his life around. He begged a residential rehabilitation program to let him into the program, and he persuaded the judge to let him complete the one-year rehab instead of going to jail. ""I didn't want to go to jail anymore,"" Jones said. ""I was physically and psychologically tired and my conscience was bothering me."" Jones earned his associate's degree at Baltimore City Community College, and he says he hasn't looked back. He found a series of nonprofit jobs and was hired by the Baltimore City Department of Health, eventually working on an initiative to improve maternal and child health. Working there, in the early 1990s, it struck him that there were no programs for fathers. So in 1992, Jones started the Men's Services program at the Department of Health, and the experience led him to found his nonprofit seven years later. ""It's my way of giving back ... in ways in which I took from my community many years ago,"" Jones said. Now married, he's raised two children with his wife and has been able to repair his relationship with his eldest son Trey. Today, they often go to baseball games together, along with Jones' youngest son. Jones' turnaround is an inspiration to Dixon and the other men in his program. ""When I learned Joe's story, (it) pretty much blew me away,"" Dixon said. ""And look what he has obtained. So nothing's impossible. ""He's more than a role model. He's that North Star."" Now Dixon feels confident that he can follow Jones' example. ""Joe allowed me to find and restore my dignity,"" he said. ""That's one of the greatest things that you can offer anyone."" ""You can't become a better father without being a better man."" Want to get involved?

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Martha Ryan couldn't believe it. She had never heard of women who were pregnant and homeless. But in one night, she met three. ""I said, 'How could that be?' "" recalled Ryan, who was volunteering at a San Francisco shelter at the time while pursuing her master's degree in public health. ""But it didn't take me long to realize that ... if they were poor, they probably wouldn't have health care, but certainly (they) would still be having sex. And they would get pregnant."" Ryan also realized the likely consequences. None of the three women had received prenatal care, meaning they were far more likely to deliver unhealthy babies. An unhealthy baby would add to the burdens of a homeless mother, and the family would likely end up dependent on state programs to survive. ""If they delivered unhealthy babies that ended up in the intensive care nursery ... (that) could have cost the system, the society, the taxpayer, all of us,"" Ryan said. ""(And) the continual costs through a child's life -- of needing more support -- is astronomical."" Preventive care, it seemed, would be much more effective, and Ryan recognized an opportunity to help these women change their lives. She took a grant-writing class and eventually secured the $52,000 she needed to start her Homeless Prenatal Program. Since 1989, the nonprofit has provided prenatal care to thousands of homeless women in San Francisco. But it's also grown to offer much more. ""I learned very early on that prenatal care alone was not enough,"" said Ryan, a 63-year-old registered nurse. ""The women that we were serving needed help with housing, mental illness, substance abuse, domestic violence. ... And if we didn't help her with these other issues, then we were not going to be able to help her long term or help her children exit poverty."" Today, Ryan's group assists more than 3,600 families per year, offering all sorts of free services to help them pull themselves out of poverty and end a cycle that can repeat itself from generation to generation. ""If you're in (poverty) and you don't have opportunities or ways to climb out of it, it's hard to get out,"" Ryan said. ""When people are given opportunities, they do it. They blaze that trail."" By helping families out of poverty, the nonprofit is also benefiting society and taxpayers. Ryan said her costs average less than $5,000 per family per year. The city of San Francisco, on the other hand, reports spending an average of $6,647 a year on medical care alone for every person who is consistently homeless. The assistance also keeps children out of foster care. ""It's a terrible loss for any mother to lose her child,"" Ryan said, ""and often they will replace it with another baby. And so, it's in all of our best interests -- especially the mother and the child -- to keep the family together and to help the mother be the best mother that she could possibly be."" Ryan's program has helped more than 80,000 families since it started, and it has earned the trust of local governments: While some of its annual budget comes from individual and corporate donations, more than half of it comes from city and state grants. ""The government sees us as their partner, and they trust us,"" Ryan said. ""They know that we work with integrity. They know that the work that we do is good, and they see the effects of our work."" Ryan's program has also earned the trust of its clientele. ""This program works,"" said Carrie Hamilton, describing herself as a former meth addict who lived in a minivan with her young daughter nearly a decade ago. When Hamilton lost her job and got pregnant again, she knew something needed to change. She reached out to Ryan's group and got help kicking her addiction, delivering a healthy baby, securing housing and stabilizing her life. She went through a year of job training with the group, and now she's part of the staff, working as an outreach and case manager as well as a health educator. ""I am so happy to be able to relay the things I've learned to moms now, especially ones I can relate to because I know where they've been,"" Hamilton said. ""They really listen, not because they fully know where I've come from, but just because I am able to meet them where they are and have a no-judgment feeling for them."" Ryan said nearly a third of her staff is made up of former clients. ""(They) are the reason why this program is what it is today,"" Ryan said. ""When a client comes in and sits down with a case manager who looks like her, who was in her shoes not that very long ago and who is now employed and working, immediate trust is formed. ... She gives her hope, hope that, 'If she did it, why couldn't I?' "" For Ryan, believing and investing in women such as Hamilton is the key to her organization's success. ""Seeing their strength and their ability to pull themselves up and, against all odds, to move forward and to change their lives, now that is inspiring."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- When Egypt's first democratically elected president was tossed out this year, the White House stopped short of calling it a coup. Doing so would have forced an end to the $1.23 billion that the United States sends in military aid a year -- and changed the course of its relationship with its strongest Arab ally in the region. But that was before Wednesday, when the military-led interim government stormed two camps full of former President Mohamed Morsy's supporters. More than 525 people were killed and 3,717 wounded in the bloodiest day in Egypt's recent history, officials there said. On Thursday, President Barack Obama condemned the violence against civilians and announced the United States is canceling next month's joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises. But will the carnage in Egypt spur more changes in U.S. policy toward the most populous Arab country? And might the hardening U.S. stance affect Egypt's own approach? The short answer: We'll have to wait and see. Mom's desperate text to daughter killed in Egypt . 'A hornets' nest' The United States helps Egypt in part because it's one of only two Arab countries -- along with Jordan -- that made peace with Israel. In return, Egypt gets more than $1 billion each year in U.S. taxpayer money for military and civilian programs. No other country except Israel gets more. That aid buys Washington an ally to depend on in a turbulent region. The U.S. doesn't want to upset that balance. And pulling aid might do so. ""It's a hornets' nest. And that's why the administration is trying not to stir it too much,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria said. What experts say about the bloodshed in Cairo . Give up some to get some . But it's not just the peace process and regional stability that the United States is interested in. Egypt controls the Suez Canal, a crucial sea route used by more than 4% of the world's oil traffic and 8% of all seaborne trade. So far, the canal is running smoothly. But a disruption there could end up hitting Americans in the pocketbook, not to mention affect the safe passage of U.S. military ships and equipment. Then there's business for American companies, intelligence cooperation -- and the military relationship. ""The reality is that the Egyptian military has not only been a source of stability for the United States in an otherwise turbulent Middle East, but it has also been a cash cow,"" said Khairi Abaza, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Currently, the Egyptian military relies on U.S. military equipment, training and services. This reliance means that Egypt is essentially a client of the U.S. military complex, and aid money is in fact re-injected back into the U.S. economy."" World urges Egypt to show restraint . All of the factors are enough to give the U.S. pause. ""We need to have a discussion about the costs and benefits of different relationships with the Egyptians, and the Egyptians need to have the same about their relationship with us,"" said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""If you want a different relationship, you have to articulate what that looks like, and accept you are going to have to give up some things to get other things."" 'A really tough dilemma' From the Obama administration's side, it's an ""incredibly complex and difficult situation"" that will require more time to figure out. That's what White House spokesman Jay Carney said in July soon after Morsy was ousted, and reporters pressed him as to why the administration wasn't calling it a coup. ""It would not be in the best interests of the United States to immediately change our assistance programs"" to Egypt, Carney said at the time. Middle East analyst Robin Wright with the Wilson Center says the core issue is what our policy ought to be. ""The United States faces a really tough dilemma now,"" she said. ""What to do about the most important country in the Arab world, the cornerstone of the peace process, a country that has received over $30 billion in U.S. aid since the peace process began in the late 1970s."" Cameraman killed in Cairo violence . Calls mounting . Some in Congress, including Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, already have called for halting the aid, saying the United States ""should not be supporting this coup."" McCain traveled to Egypt on August 5 along with Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Both held meetings with representatives of the interim government and the Muslim Brotherhood. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said the United States hasn't committed much of this year's aid -- and that's a good thing. ""This is an opportunity to have a pause and say to the Egyptians, 'You have an opportunity to come together,' "" he said. ""You have to have the military understand that that's what we're looking for, a transition right away, as soon as possible."" Three choices . According to senior U.S. officials last month, the administration is examining three potential options: . -- Call it a coup and cut off aid. -- Call it a coup and issue a national security waiver to allow aid to continue. -- Don't call it a coup because the Egyptian military has taken steps to move the country toward a civilian transitional government and subsequent elections. Now, officials -- both current and former -- recognize the climate is not encouraging. 'Time to call it a coup' ""I think it is time to call it a coup. I think it was time six weeks ago,"" former Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said Wednesday. ""Suspend military assistance so the military is invested in the process of rewriting the constitution, setting the parliament and electing a new president."" Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday that while a political solution is still possible, ""it has been made much, much harder, much more complicated."" ""The path toward violence leads only to greater instability, economic disaster and suffering,"" Kerry said . He also called for an end to Egypt's new state of emergency, which prevents freedom of peaceful assembly and due process. The Egypt raid, at a glance . U.S. still considering its strategy . But as far as firm actions, the United States' game plan has yet to be drawn. The Pentagon is mulling whether to halt or delay arms exports. But as leaders in Washington mull their options, Americans overwhelmingly support staying out of the unrest, according to a recent United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll. Almost eight in 10 Americans (78%) said the United States should ""mostly stay out of events"" in Egypt, according to the poll. But 16% said the U.S. should ""do more"" to end the violence. The desire to stay out of Egypt's affairs might be connected to the fact that a majority of Americans feel what happens in the country isn't very important to U.S. interests. According to a Pew Research Center poll, 61% of Americans say what happens in Egypt is somewhat important or not important, while 36% say it is very important. But ultimately, it's up to Egyptians to find a peaceful resolution between the military-backed interim government and those who want Morsy back. ""The role the United States had tried to play as mediator between the military and the Muslim Brotherhood to try to find some kind of compromise is now moot,"" said Wright, the Middle East analyst. ""There's not much the United States can do."" CNN's Elise Labott, Barbara Starr, Greg Botelho and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","The U.S. gives Egypt about $1.23 billion in military aid a year .

"(CNN) -- On the first anniversary of the Israeli raid on a flotilla headed to Gaza, organizers of another flotilla planned for June held a news conference Monday that concluded with a minute of silence for the nine activists killed in that raid. The event was held on the Mavi Marmara, the ship that was the scene of the raid, which led to the deterioration of relations between Israel and Turkey, its once strong Muslim ally. Mavi Marmara -- owned by the Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH -- and five other ships were on their way to Gaza carrying humanitarian aid and about 700 activists from various countries when Israeli soldiers swarmed aboard it in international waters on the night of May 30-31, 2010. Eight Turks and one American of Turkish origin died. Istanbul pulled its ambassador from Israel after the incident and the post has remained vacant. Huseyin Oruc, an executive from IHH, said Monday the flotilla that will set out in the last week of June in an attempt to break the Israeli blockade will consist of 15 ships and about 1,500 participants from 100 countries. The ships will carry a wide variety of humanitarian aid for Gaza, ranging from children's toys to construction and medical supplies. They will be leaving from a variety of Mediterranean ports. At the news conference, Evangelos Pissias of Greece read out a joint statement on behalf of the international flotilla organization welcoming the recent decision of Egypt to open the Rafah border crossing into Gaza. However, he said, ""We must continue to challenge this blockade. We call on all states, the United Nations and international organizations to support our action and demand that Israel refrain from attacking our vessels."" Egypt opened its border crossing into Gaza on Saturday. It had been mostly kept closed after Hamas, an Islamic militant group, got control of Gaza in June 2007. Asked if the flotilla organizers are taking any measures to protect the people on board the ships in case of an Israeli raid, Ann Wright, representing the American boat that will be a part of this year's flotilla, told CNN, ""There is not much we can do. They have got the weapons. We have no weapons. We don't want weapons. We are going non-violently."" The news conference ended with prayer and the minute of silence. Monday evening in Istanbul, anger spilled out as several thousand Turks gathered in the city's central Taksim Square to mark the anniversary. Chants of ""Damn Israel"" were interspersed with Arabic- and Turkish-language Islamic music as people waved Palestinian and Turkish flags at the event, which also was organized by the Turkish Humanitarian Foundation. The crowd, including men, women and children, carried banners saying ""Support Gaza,"" ""Mavi Marmara martyrs are our honor"" and ""Palestine will win."" They also sent Chinese lanterns into the sky and lit flares in red and green. There was a moment of prayer. The crowd got loudest when chanting ""Allahu Akbar."" One of the participants in the rally, Rabia Demirci, has registered to take part in the next flotilla. ""I don't think (Israel) will attack after this,"" she said. ""The Rafah crossing is open, too. God willing, it won't. But if it attacks, we will continue on our path again, saying on with resistance. No obstacle can block our path."" Palestinians also marked the day, with many taking to small boats off the coast of Gaza City.","A moment of silence was held on the Mavi Marmara for the nine activists who died .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican authorities say they've arrested three additional suspects connected to the kidnapping of 13 youths from a bar in the country's capital. Federal prosecutors told reporters that Jonathan Robles, Pedro Francisco Paz Lopez and Fernando Fernandez Sanchez are suspected in connection with the kidnapping and killing of the youths. The mysterious mass kidnapping from the Heaven after-hours bar in May drew international attention after furious family members protested, claiming authorities weren't taking the case seriously. The allegations have sparked concerns about whether violence has surged into Mexico City, where residents largely have been spared from drug war casualties seen in other parts of the country. Last month authorities said they'd found the missing youths' bodies in a shallow grave near Mexico City. Mexico City Prosecutor Rodolfo Rios Garza said last month that the motive for the killing was revenge for a slaying that occurred in another bar in the capital. At least seven other suspects have been arrested in the case. Victims' family members have said they don't trust Mexican authorities and have called for an independent international investigation of the case.

"(CNN) -- As an ailing Nelson Mandela recuperates in a South African hospital, the world celebrated his 95th birthday Thursday, honoring his legacy in various ways, including performing 67 minutes of community service. Voice from a Kenyan slum: Mandela saved my life . Schoolchildren sang ""Happy Birthday"" to the former president during morning assemblies while crowds left flowers and candles outside his Pretoria hospital. The day also marks 15 years since he married his wife, Graca Machel. President Jacob Zuma said that Mandela, who has been hospitalized with a lung ailment since June, is ""steadily improving."" Zuma's latest assessment comes after weeks of describing Mandela's heath as critical but stable. Read more: The six names of Nelson Mandela . The president wished Mandela a happy birthday. ""We are proud to call this international icon our own as South Africans and wish him good health,"" Zuma said. ""We thank all our people for supporting Madiba throughout the hospitalization with undying love and compassion. We also thank all for responding to the call to give Madiba the biggest birthday celebration ever this year."" South Africans affectionately refer to Mandela as Madiba, his clan name. The United Nations declared July 18 as Mandela Day four years ago to honor his role in reconciling a country torn apart by apartheid. It started as a call to promote global peace and encourage community service. Read more: Mandela posters mark 95th birthday . His foundation is asking people to volunteer 67 minutes of public service on his birthday, a reference to the number of years he devoted to public service. President Bill Clinton joins tributes . At an event in New York City, former U.S. President Bill Clinton was among the speakers to pay a heartfelt tribute to Mandela and his achievements. Clinton, whose presidency coincided with Mandela's, recalled how they developed a personal friendship over the course of two decades after first meeting before Clinton's election to the White House. He paid tribute to Mandela's life of service, saying the world could learn from his example, as an anti-apartheid campaigner, as South Africa's president and after leaving office. Mandela's commitment to helping those with HIV/AIDS helped millions of people in the developing world gain access to medication, he said. Clinton also recalled how Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl shot by the Taliban for promoting education for girls, had cited Mandela as an influence in her own address to the United Nations a week ago. ""Though he is old and frail and fighting for his life ... what is in his heart still glows in his smile and lights up the room,"" Clinton said, adding that Mandela had demonstrated that ""none of us has to be in public office to be of public service."" Andrew Mlangeni, 87, who was imprisoned with Mandela, hailed his friend as ""a modern day global icon, an embodiment of the values of justice, peace, selflessness and consideration."" The world's celebration of Mandela's birthday is also a celebration of the human values that the former leader represents, he said. He said Mandela was ""making very good progress "" and appealed to those gathered to continue to pray for him. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the U.S. civil rights leader, praised Mandela's commitment to healing and equality and urged people to honor his courage. The world ""will never forget the living witness of Nelson Mandela,"" he said, describing him as a ""giant of men."" 'Path to justice' U.S. President Barack Obama, who visited with Mandela's family in South Africa last month, also sent birthday wishes. ""People everywhere have the opportunity to honor Madiba through individual and collective acts of service,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""Through our own lives, by heeding his example, we can honor the man who showed his own people -- and the world -- the path to justice, equality and freedom."" The frail icon has not appeared in public for years, but he retains his popularity as the father of democracy and emblem of the nation's fight against apartheid. His defiance of white minority rule focused the world's attention on apartheid, the legalized racial segregation enforced by the South African government until 1994. The raid that saw Mandela jailed for life: Liliesleaf 50 years on . His hospitalization has given his birthday a sentimental touch. The South African Embassy in the United States said it will be the biggest celebration since his birthday in 1990, the year he was freed from prison. The festivities are not limited to South Africa. In the United States, the embassy said 18 cities, including the nation's capital, will hold various events to celebrate his birthday. Family feud . Mandela's family has faced an anxious few weeks while the former president has been hospitalized. His daughter, Zindzi Mandela-Motlhajwa, told the South African Press Association on Thursday that her father was making ""remarkable progress"" and that she looks forward to seeing him back home soon. A public family feud over where three of Mandela's deceased children should be buried has added to their stress. Last month, family members sued Mandela's grandson to return the remains to Qunu, the former president's childhood home. The grandson, Mandla Mandela, exhumed the remains from Qunu two years ago, then reburied them in Mvezo, where he's built a visitor center. They were returned to Qunu this month after a court order. The matter is back in court Thursday, said Freddie Pilusa, a spokesman for the grandson. ""Mandla does not want the graves repatriated, but he wants the decision forcing him to move them rescinded because it was based on incorrect information,"" he said. Mandela, a Nobel peace laureate, spent 27 years in prison for fighting against oppression of minorities in South Africa.

"(CNN) -- Legendary India batsman Sachin Tendulkar created yet another piece of cricket history on Tuesday, becoming the first player to score 15,000 Test match runs. Tendulkar reached the milestone with a single on day three of the first Test between India and West Indies in Delhi. The right-hander, known as the ""Little Master"", finished the day 33 not out on 15,005 career runs. After making his debut for India against Pakistan in November 1989, Tendulkar became Test cricket's leading run-scorer in 2008 when he surpassed West Indies' batsman Brian Lara's total of 11,953. The 38-year-old will be hoping to pass another landmark figure in the final two days of the Delhi contest and become the first player to score 100 centuries in international cricket. The Mumbai native scored his 99th international 100 against South Africa at this year's World Cup, which hosts India won for the second time in the tournament's 36-year history. India finished day three on 152-2, needing 124 runs to overhaul the West Indies' two-innings total of 484 and clinch victory in the opening match of the three-Test series. Debutant Ravichandran Ashwin was the host's star performer, taking six wickets for 47 runs to match the second-best performance from an Indian bowler in their debut Test match. India will resume on Wednesday with Tendulkar at the crease alongside Rahul Dravid, who is the second-highest run-scorer in the history on Test cricket on 12,859. Meanwhile, another cricket legend announced his return to the sport on Tuesday, with former Australian spin-bowler Shane Warne coming out of retirement to play in the country's Twenty20 league. Warne took 708 Test wickets during a 15-year career before initially retiring from cricket in 2007, only to return to play for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008. Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan is the only bowler to have taken more Test wickets than Warne with 800. Warne will play for the Melbourne Stars in the eight-team Big Bash League which is set to get underway next month. ""This is something that I'm passionate about, it's something that I think is unique to Australian cricket, it's city-based cricket teams, it's something new and that's what sort of enticed me,"" the 42-year-old told Cricket Australia's website. ""More to get involved with Cricket Australia, to put something back into the game, to help out Whitey (Stars captain Cameron White), Shippy (Stars coach Greg Shipperd), all the young kids that are there to pass on my knowledge to them."" The right-armer also denied his return to the game was motivated by money. ""It's got nothing to do with money,"" insisted Warne. ""If it was something to do with money about me coming out to play cricket I'd still be playing in the IPL."" Stars president Eddie McGuire revealed the Melbourne Cricket Ground-based team had initially approached Warne to make two guest appearances for the side, before he agreed to play for the whole campaign. ""This was sincere,"" said McGuire. ""We were happy to pay the money for two games and we're very happy to pay for the full eight (matches)."" Warne will make his first appearance for Melbourne against Sydney Thunder on December 17.","India's Sachin Tendulkar becomes the first cricketer to score 15,000 Test runs .

"Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott met with protesters overnight and defended his position to not amend his state's controversial ""stand your ground"" law. ""Tonight, the protesters again asked that I call a special session of the legislature to repeal Florida's 'stand your ground' law,"" Scott said in a written statement. ""I told them I agree with the Task Force on Citizen Safety and Protection, which concurred with the law."" Scott issued a proclamation Friday for a ""statewide day of prayer for unity."" The proclamation calls Trayvon Martin's death a tragedy, notes that ""emotions are running high"" and calls for Floridians to show unity. Earlier, Scott said that he mourns with Martin's parents, but that he stands by the findings of the task force, which consulted with citizens and experts. The protesters are students and members of Dream Defenders, an activist group that participates in civic engagement and promotes nonviolent social change. They walked into Scott's office Wednesday, led by Amon Gabriel, 9, and asked to speak to the governor. After the protesters camped there for three days, Scott met with them overnight and told them he has not changed his position. The Dream Defenders say they will continue their sit-in until their demand is met. ""We'd like the repeal of 'stand your ground' or some type of modification where we can hold people responsible to a level that humanity expects, where we don't have 17-year-olds getting gunned down with no justice for them and their families,"" said the group's legal and policy director, Ahmad Abuznaid. A call for reforms . On Thursday, Florida officials joined state House Democratic Leader Perry Thurston in urging that reforms be made to the controversial law. One of those officials, Senate Democratic Leader Chris Smith, is refiling his legislation to change ""stand your ground."" ""We have a clear case that shows SYG has very troubling problems, and those problems are central to the well-being of Floridians,"" he said. Though former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman's defense never cited ""stand your ground"" laws in its case, the jury was instructed to consider them during deliberations. The jury acquitted Zimmerman of all charges Saturday in the 2012 shooting death of Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old. Stevie Wonder says he'll boycott 'stand your ground' states . The Florida version of the law states, ""A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."" Eight other states have laws worded similarly, while 22 total states, including Florida, have laws stating that residents have no ""duty"" to retreat from a would-be attacker, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Civil rights groups attack the laws as racially motivated and are planning nationwide demonstrations. Stevie Wonder is refusing to perform in any state with such a law. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the laws ""try to fix something that was never broken"" and now encourage ""violent situations to escalate in public."" But just as adamantly as the laws are decried, the National Rifle Association has stood by the measures it helped many states adopt. ""The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept; it's a fundamental human right,"" said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. ""To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable."" What are the chances of repeal? As for those Dream Defenders at the Florida governor's office, their protest may be futile. Scott's office noted that the gubernatorial task force recommends the law stay in place, though with minor tweaks, including limiting neighborhood watches to observing and reporting. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he doubts the protests will change anything. Overturning laws isn't incredibly common already, and with ""stand your ground,"" there are complicating factors. The NRA is strong in the 22 states that have the laws, and ""I think there is some popular appeal to the notion, the very general notion, that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you shouldn't have to, in essence, run from crime."" Also, the laws are relatively new, most of them enacted in the past eight years, and it's unlikely the same legislators who put ""stand your ground"" laws on the books would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong. ""The more common response is, they're going to dig their heels,"" he said. As a parallel, Webster offered the ""Draconian"" drug sentencing laws of the 1980s, which hugely expanded incarceration rates, were outrageously expensive and did little to improve public safety. Yet, the country is only now examining those laws and considering their repeal. ""I assume, in part, that's because the people who passed them are no longer there,"" Webster said. The trickiest factor, however, is that proponents and opponents of ""stand your ground"" can find in the Zimmerman case assertions to support their beliefs, he said. One side believes Martin attacked Zimmerman, and Zimmerman had no choice but to fire his weapon to defend himself. The other side believes Zimmerman racially profiled Martin, followed him against a dispatcher's order and then shot a teen who was only reacting, perhaps out of fear, to being followed. ""You can find whatever you want to back your assumptions,"" Webster said. Putting on his gun policy expert hat, Webster said he felt the laws are a ""very bad idea,"" and they don't do what they were intended to do: deter criminals and protect the citizenry. Doubts about 'stand your ground' After Florida expanded its ""Castle Doctrine"" laws to a ""stand your ground"" provision in 2005, the National District Attorneys Association released a report. It said a ""diminished sense of public safety"" after 9/11, a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to protect victims, a perception that due process trumps victims' rights and a decrease in gun legislation spurred the creation of ""stand your ground"" laws. The study cited concerns from law enforcement officials, including doubts that it would deter criminals. ""There must be appreciation among the would-be criminals that deadly force can be used against them, leading to a change in criminal behavior,"" the study said. ""Unfortunately, attendees at the National District Attorneys Association symposium expressed little confidence that criminals would take the provisions of the Castle Doctrine into consideration before committing a crime."" Webster pointed to a Texas A&M University study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed Castle Doctrine or ""stand your ground"" laws from 2000 to 2010. Researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, but there was an 8% spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter. ""The data are pretty compelling, showing that it increased justifiable homicides, and it increased homicides overall,"" Webster said. ""In all likelihood, it really led to more altercations similar to the Zimmerman-Martin exchange."" Additional protests this weekend . The Zimmerman verdict has been met by strong reactions. A national ""Justice for Trayvon"" day is slated for Saturday in 100 cities, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. The protesters will call for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman. The rallies will take place outside of federal court buildings in cities across the country, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.

"(CNN) -- Brutal winter weather is making dire conditions even more so in parts of the Middle East, especially for thousands of Syrian refugees enduring frigid temperatures in tents. The coldest air of the season was moving in behind a heavy snowstorm that blanketed refugee camps in Turkey and Lebanon. Syria . In Syria, residents in cities pummeled by warfare were taking drastic measures to stay alive. A video posted online shows three men and two children burning pages of schoolbooks to stay warm in the besieged city of Rastan. Read more: Scavenging for food, Syrian children witness war . ""We can't use the heaters inside our residences,"" one of the men says. ""No fuel, no wood, no electricity."" Rastan, near the dissident bastion of Homs, has been choked off from basic supplies such as electricity, bread and water. In the Syrian city of Busra, a video shows a man gathering snow in a bucket to save as drinking water. ""We don't have water, we don't have heat,"" the man says. ""We will try to make the snow into water because they cut off the water long ago."" CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the videos.

Snow and heavy rains had fallen over most Syrian cities in the past day, the state-run SANA news agency reported Wednesday. Snow was forecast for Thursday in eastern Syria and over the mountains. Temperatures were running 5 to 10 degrees Celsius (9 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit) below average for this time of year across Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel, CNN forecaster Brandon Miller said. So far this winter, the region had seen above-average temperatures, he said. Winds have been strong, in some cases blowing more than 70 kph (43 mph), which makes the wind chill much colder than the air temperature. But in one ray of hope for those shivering in tents, Wednesday and Thursday are expected to be the coldest days before the weather clears up and temperatures rebound by the end of the week. The world in 2013: What's next? West Bank . More than 500 Palestinians have been injured and more than 400 homes submerged by floodwater this week from a storm that struck the West Bank area, Palestinian media reported. The flooding claimed the lives of two women who were in a taxi that was swept away, a Palestinian medical official told CNN. ""All of a sudden, floods started carrying the vehicle and sweeping it in the (path) of the fast-moving floods over in a valley,"" Dr. Ghassan Hamdan said. The Command of National Security Forces announced Wednesday evening a state of emergency, the Palestinian news and information agency WAFA reported. Civil defense forces were searching for a man from the Tulkarm area village of Attil who had been seen leaving his stranded car on Tuesday, WAFA said. The rains damaged dozens of homes and property throughout the West Bank. More than 530 people were rescued in Salfit province, WAFA said. The Palestine Weather Service attributed the cold to a polar air mass accompanied by thunderstorms and hail that hit the area. Jordan . At a Syrian refugee camp in Amman, Jordan, temperatures plunged early Wednesday to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) with fierce winds. Torrential rain and increasing snowfall paralyzed much of the country, and most government and public offices in Jordan closed Wednesday and were to remain closed Thursday, the state-run Petra news agency said. In the next three days, temperatures in Amman will drop below freezing, Petra said, citing the Jordan Meteorological Department. Amman has received 101 millimeters (4 inches) of rain over the past three days, whereas the January average for the entire month is only 63 millimeters (about 2 1/2 inches), Miller said. The city gets snow about once a year, on average. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the kingdom saw 757 traffic collisions, Petra reported, citing the directorate of general security.

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration warned consumers on Thursday that popular pain reliever acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions in some people. The FDA will now require a warning about the skin conditions to be added to the labels of prescription drug containing acetaminophen and will ask manufacturers of acetaminophen products to add warnings to their over-the-counter medications. Acetaminophen is found in numerous prescription and over-the-counter products designed to treat pain and reduce fever. According to the FDA, the skin reactions, known as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necroylis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis are rare but can be deadly. These conditions can cause blisters, serious rashes, reddening of the skin and the detachment of the upper surface of the skin known as the epidermis. The reactions can appear at any time people take the product, even if they only take it once. Other drugs designed to treat fever and pain, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, also carry the risk of these skin reactions, but they already carry a warning on their labels. The FDA stresses that anyone who develops these types of conditions after using acetaminophen should stop taking the product immediately and visit a doctor or emergency room. If people have already experienced these skin problems while occasionally taking acetaminophen, they should not take the drug again and should inform their doctor about the reaction, the FDA said. The FDA decided to announce the warning after evaluating serious skin reactions associated with acetaminophen. From 1969 to 2012, it identified 91 cases of SJS/TEN and 16 cases of AGEP, which resulted in 67 hospitalizations and 12 deaths. The agency said it is difficult to determine how frequently serious skin reactions occur with the ingredient because the drug has been used by so many people for such a long time and at different doses. However, it estimates that these skin outbreaks are rare.","Acetaminophen may cause severe skin reactions in some people, FDA says .

"(CNN) -- Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is unhappy with last week's compromise over whether Catholic institutions should be required to cover contraception for their employees, arguing that birth control ""shouldn't be covered by insurance at all."" The issue, Santorum claims, is ""economic liberty."" But in the past, he has made his real objection clear, categorizing contraception as ""a license to do things in a sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be."" Taken with statements Santorum made in his 2005 book, ""It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good,"" his opposition to contraception (as well as to abortion, even in the case of rape) seems part and parcel of a deep hostility toward efforts to empower women and enhance their status. He has shown nothing but contempt for what his book called the ""radical"" feminist ""pitch"" that ""men and women be given an equal opportunity to make it to the top in the workplace."" So perhaps it's not surprising that at the time of publication he did not list his wife as a co-author or contributor, although when asked last week about this and other comments on working mothers, he now says his wife wrote that part of the book. Whichever member of the couple wrote the section on women, it is worth revisiting a couple of its points. Take the book's dismissal of programs to help impoverished single mothers improve their job prospects by returning to school: ""The notion that college education is a cost-effective way to help poor, low-skill, unmarried mothers with high school diplomas or GEDs move up the economic ladder is just wrong."" Or its claim that unnamed ""surveys"" have shown that educated professional women find it ""easier, more 'professionally' gratifying, and certainly more socially affirming, to work outside the home than to give up their careers to take care of their children."" The Santorums' apparent hostility to women's educational and professional advancement is insulting and out of touch with today's world. But it is also odd in light of their purported interest in the welfare of children. It turns out that the most powerful single influence on a child's educational success is not the mother's marital status but her own level of education and her educational aspirations for her children, according to education researcher W. Norton Grubb. Having more education is one of the biggest predictors of women having careers. But it's also one of the biggest predictors of women (and their husbands) doing more child care, according to a forthcoming paper by Paula England, a New York University sociologist and research fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, and her collaborator, Anjula Srivastava. Educated mothers are much more likely to work outside the home and to return to work within a year after the birth of a child. They also tend to have fewer children than their less educated counterparts. Yet on average, they spend more time in direct interaction with their kids than less educated women. Well-educated fathers also spend more time in child care than less-educated dads. But, interestingly, the amount of child care a man does is more directly influenced by his wife's educational level than his own. On average, having a wife with a college degree raises a man's participation in child care by 3Â½ hours per week. Educated parents find more time to spend with their children by reducing time dedicated to home-based activities that involve little interaction with children. They spend less time on sleep and personal grooming, less time doing housework and less time watching television than their less-educated counterparts, regardless of their employment status. This is hardly evidence that they do not find child care gratifying. No single choice about how to organize work and family life is right or possible -- for every family. And every choice has tradeoffs. Sometimes, having a mom stay home is a big help. On the other hand, when a mother works outside the home, her husband generally does more child care and has higher parental knowledge about his childrens' friends, routines and needs, cutting across the tendency for fathers to be second-string parents at home. Every family must make its own, sometimes difficult, decisions about what best fits their particular needs and preferences. We don't need politicians like Rick Santorum -- or, as he now somewhat unchivalrously claims, his wife -- making those decisions more painful by suggesting that women who choose to pursue careers are worse mothers than those who do not.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Justice Department will not seek the death penalty for U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden, Attorney General Eric Holder wrote to Russian authorities in a letter dated July 23. In the letter, Holder says Snowden's arguments for temporary asylum in Russia are without merit. Snowden is seeking asylum because he claims he will be tortured and face the death penalty if returned to the United States. But the death penalty is not an option given the current charges against Snowden, and even if additional charges are filed, the United States would still not seek capital punishment, Holder wrote. Once back in the United States, Snowden would not be tortured and would face a civilian trial with a lawyer appointed to him, the attorney general wrote. ""We believe that these assurances eliminate these asserted grounds for Mr. Snowden's claim that he should be treated as a refugee or granted asylum,"" Holder wrote. Snowden did not access 'crown jewels' of NSA intel, official says . He also said it is untrue that Snowden cannot travel because his U.S. passport was revoked. Snowden is still a U.S. citizen and is eligible for a limited-validity passport that would authorize a direct return to the United States. ""The United States is willing to immediately issue such a passport to Mr. Snowden,"" Holder wrote. Father asks Obama to rein in Holder . In a letter released Friday, Snowden's father called on President Barack Obama to order Holder to dismiss the criminal complaint filed against his son. Lon Snowden defended his son's actions, comparing them to acts of civil disobedience. ""We are also appalled at your administration's scorn for due process, the rule of law, fairness and the presumption of innocence as regards Edward,"" the letter said. Earlier in the day, Lon Snowden said on NBC's ""Today"" that Snowden did the right thing by leaking U.S. intelligence and helping Americans see the truth. ""I think my son, when he takes his final breath, whether it's today or 100 years from now, (will) be comfortable with what he did,"" he said. ""He did what he knew was right. He shared the truth with the American people. What we choose to do with it is up to us as a people."" Lon Snowden expressed his disappointment with the recent House vote that continued funding for the spy program that Edward Snowden exposed. There is a need for a strong intelligence community, Lon Snowden said, but many who voted for continued funding for the program are really looking out for the special interests that will benefit. ""It's all about the money,"" he said. The father said he has not been in direct contact with his son, but there has been indirect contact through intermediaries. The intermediaries do not include WikiLeaks, Lon Snowden said, but he added that he is thankful to that group for aiding his son. ""I'm thankful for anybody at this point that is providing him with assistance to keep him safe and secure,"" he said. U.S., Russian officials continue talks . Meanwhile, the Kremlin said that the Russian security agency FSB is talking to American officials. ""The situation around Snowden is not being discussed at the top level. There's a discussion between heads of FSB and FBI,"" the Kremlin press office said. A spokesman for Vladimir Putin said the Russian president ""expressed a firm intention to not allow"" further damage to U.S. interests, including a pledge by Snowden not to release any more intelligence. ""And I have no doubt this is how it will be, no matter how the situation develops,"" the spokesman said, according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. The many mysteries of Snowden's transit zone . Snowden isn't yet allowed to step outside the Moscow airport where he's been confined for weeks. He is waiting for permission to stay elsewhere in Russia while his request for temporary asylum is considered. He has been searching for a place to settle after the United States charged him with espionage. The former National Security Agency contractor, who admitted last month to revealing sweeping U.S. electronic surveillance programs to the news media, left Hong Kong for Moscow on June 23. Snowden may remain stuck in the transit area for weeks and maybe months, the head of Russia's migration service, Vladimir Volokh, told the Russian news agency Interfax. The maximum length of time Snowden can spend at the airport is six months, he said.

"(CNN) -- It's been more than a week since Brown University student Sunil Tripathi was last seen, but authorities appear to be no closer to knowing where he is. They are scouring Providence, Rhode Island, and nearby cities for any sign of the missing 22-year-old man. Tripathi was on approved leave from the Ivy League school, meaning that he had requested and was granted time off, but he remained a student there. ""We miss his warm smile and generous gentle spirit so very much. Your help and prayers to find him mean so much,"" his family said in a statement. Tripathi was last seen in the campus area on the morning of March 16. He was wearing blue jeans, a black Eastern Mountain Sports ski jacket, glasses, and a Philadelphia Eagles wool hat. He is about 6 feet tall, 130 pounds and has short dark hair. According to his family, the FBI is assisting in the investigation, which is being led by the Providence Police Department. Detective Mark Sacco told CNN that police have have no solid leads so far. Tripathi apparently left his apartment without his wallet and cell phone. As far as police know, he was alone. Tripathi grew up in Radnor, Pennsylvania. His family said he is a talented saxophonist and a philosophy major. He has been living in Providence since 2008. A public Facebook page has been created to help find Tripathi. Updates on the search effort are being posted there, as well as photographs and messages of encouragement. ""Our concerns are first and foremost with Sunil and his family,"" said Margaret Klawunn, vice president for student life and campus services at Brown University. ""We are hopeful that by encouraging the Brown community to help spread the word that Sunil will be located.""

"(CNN) -- When golfers admit to feeling ""brain dead"" and ""unconscious"" -- as Rory McIlroy did at Muirfield on Thursday -- perhaps it's time to book an appointment with the doctor. Dr Bob Rotella that is; the legendary mind coach who has helped some of the game's biggest names like Keegan Bradley, Padraig Harrington and Darren Clarke plot their way to major success. McIlroy's very public loss of form ended with a disheartening opening round of eight-over-par in Scotland and those comments to the media gave an insight into his present trouble state of mind. But the good news is that if the beleaguered former world No. 1 wants to pick up the phone to Rotella, the revered coach would be only too happy to help. ""Anybody would love to work with Rory,"" Rotella exclusively told CNN. ""He's a really good kid, he has a lot of talent and he loves golf. Even people who love golf in some moments can feel bad about it but I've never seen him at a stage where he hates it. ""I think he probably feels like it's getting hard at the moment. Sometimes this game is so easy for someone like him -- it's ridiculous how easy it can be. ""But even for them sometimes you say 'Where is it? Where did it go? When is it coming back?' That's the big question. ""I spent some time with him a few years ago at The Masters. Perhaps it was nothing to do with me but the next week he won at Charlotte for the first time in the U.S. and he has obviously played some incredible golf (since)."" McIlroy's form has dipped ever since he was launched as a new Nike protÃ©gÃ© in a blaze of publicity at the start of this year. So, is he struggling with his new clubs or are off the course distractions, like his romance with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, limiting his time on the range? Whatever is behind his malaise, the 24-year-old, who has won two majors, is still brutally honest about his current failings, laying his feelings bare in that startling press conference. So what did Rotella make of his comments? ""First of all, it says to me that he's a young man who's very comfortable with himself and he feels good enough about himself that he is comfortable talking about it,"" added Rotella, who has been coaching amateur players in HSBC's golf zone. ""That's a good sign. This is the most honest thing any of us will ever do in our life -- playing golf. ""Rory sounds like he knows he's not where he needs to be or was when he was playing his best and he knows he's got to get back there. But that's pretty common. We've just seen Tiger Woods go through two or three years of struggling with it. ""What usually happens is you reach a certain point when you sink to a level and then say 'This is ridiculous.' At that point you simplify everything, stop over-analysing and go out there and kick some butt. ""What the world needs to understand is that he's only half an inch away. It happens a lot in the world of sport, not just in golf. Rory's been a very skilled, confident, successful player for a long time. ""He will be back, it's just a matter of how long will it take."" Many commentators on the game have suggested McIlroy seek Rotella out while he is in situ at Muirfield. He's a champion in his own right at focusing players and encouraging them to adopt routines that will keep them calm in the pressure cooker atmosphere of a major championship. So where would he start if McIlroy -- who reportedly told the Times newspaper that ""it could be beneficial to see someone like Rotella again"" -- wanders into his surgery in the next few hours? ""I'd probably want to hear him tell me what is going on, to find out if what he said to the media is what really is going on,"" Rotella explained.

"(CNN) -- A common joke in our household is that when (if!) our girls go to sleep-away camp, my husband and I will join them by sneaking into their suitcases and bunking in a nearby cabin. ""No!"" scream our girls, ages 5 and 7, making it clear they will want nothing to do with Mom and Dad once they leave for camp. But there is always Camp Visiting Day, I like to remind them without sharing my fear of the event itself. That fear arose after watching this hilarious video from a few years ago of the moment parents were let into a camp on visiting day. Yes, it looks almost like the running of the bulls. ""There's nothing like it,"" said mom of three Sarah Maizes, author of the book ""Got Milf? The Modern Mom's Guide to Feeling Fabulous, Looking Great and Rocking a Minivan,"" and all around funny woman on all things parenting related. Visiting Day . Maizes, whose 13-year-old daughter and 10-year-old twins are at sleep-away camp this summer, described the ritual in which parents are lined up, a whistle goes off and they essentially race one another to reach their children. ""You are running to show you care more than the other parents,"" she added, cringing as she remembered the one year she was late. It all seemed innocent enough. She was driving fast so she wouldn't be late for visiting day, when a police officer pulled her over. He didn't think speeding to be on time at camp was a valid excuse and handed her a ticket, which made her, you guessed it, late. ""Where were you?"" her daughter asked, shedding a few tears, when her mom finally arrived. Mom said she was ""mortified."" ""It's stressful because it's ... like a summer's worth of love shoved into this one little day,"" Maizes said. Did Somebody Break a Hip? Another way to show the love? Maizes said she's seen ""massive gift baskets"" on visiting day filled with games, makeup, candy, gum, jump ropes and those ""foam things that fly through the air."" ""You'd think somebody broke a hip, I swear to God,"" she joked. ""These baskets are so massive. ... They're like huge apologies wrapped up in cellophane. We're so sorry we sent you away. We still love you."" Refresh, Refresh, Refresh . My sister-in-law, Drucie Belman, a mom of two whose 11-year-old son went to sleep-away camp for the first time this year, says she would hit 'refresh' several times a day on the camp's website when her son first went away, hoping to see a picture. She hadn't gotten any letters yet. (She forwarded me a video, which satirizes the ""refreshing"" that moms of kids at sleep-away camp are doing, but be advised it does contain some offensive language.) ""You look every day for (the photos), and sometimes he's like a dot in the background, and I still send it to my mother-in-law,"" she said. Jenny Isenman, founder of the blog, The Suburban Jungle, said she might be up until 1 a.m. some days ""watching for the pictures to come in."" ""We are so overprotective at this point and so involved,"" the humorist, whose 11-year-old son went to sleepaway camp last year and the year before, joked. ""It's like, God forbid you don't see your kid one day. Is he still alive? Is he having fun?"" The Phone Calls . Some camps allow kids to phone home and some do not. Isenman's son was able to call but just for a few minutes each time. ""You get that phone call from your kid and it's you and your husband on the phone and all hell breaks loose,"" she said. ""The moms just get so frustrated with the dads. They get so frustrated with the questions they ask. They're not the right questions,"" she added. She joked about how her husband asked his son if he received his letters, and when her son said yes, her husband asked which letters he got. ""I'm like, what do you mean which ones?"" she said. ""I have friends who have literally taken the phone from their husband's hands and they're like, 'Your time is up.'"" Why Do It? I have never been to sleep-away camp, and somewhat dread the year my girls will feel they are ready to go. I know it would be an amazing experience for them, but at the same time, I love spending time with my kids and can't imagine not being with them a chunk of the summer. So I wanted to know, from moms who've been there, why they send their kids in the first place and how they cope. My sister-in-law said she wanted to give her son a chance to ""fly free"" and ""reinvent himself"" since he's the second child with an older brother who gets lots of attention. ""I think he was able to have a super fresh start. He didn't have to be the kid who wore glasses. He didn't have to be the chess kid, he could be whatever,"" she told me as she was driving to Massachusetts to pick up her son from camp. ""I cope with it because he's doing exactly what he should be doing."" Maizes' advice to me and other moms considering camp is to think about how great it can be for the kids. ""Summer camp is an experience to give your children that is unlike any other experience and one of the best growth experiences you can possibly have so ... know you are doing the right thing."" ""You remind yourself how much fun you had when you were a kid,"" said Isenman. ""You can't take it away from them because of your own sadness or your own homesickness."" ""So that's how you cope and also a lot of wine,"" she added.

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stood firm Sunday against global calls for him to step down, insisting that his vision should be the foundation of any future solution to the country's crisis. In a rare public speech, al-Assad lambasted those who want to ""fragment Syria"" and accused foreigners of helping fuel terrorism on the ground. ""Those are the enemies of the people and the enemies of God. And the enemies of God will go to hell,"" the president told a packed auditorium of supporters. Al-Assad laid out a plan for a solution to the crisis, which he said should start with regional countries ending their support for ""terrorists."" The government frequently describes dissidents as terrorists. The president's plan includes a national dialogue as well as the writing of a new constitution that would be put up for a public referendum. But there's a major caveat to the plan: Al-Assad said he will not deal with ""terrorists"" -- a description that, in his view, includes the vast majority of the opposition. Similarly, opposition members have said they will not work directly with al-Assad's ""criminal"" government, nor will they accept any solution that doesn't involve al-Assad's departure. Egypt's Morsy calls for trial of al-Assad . ""There can be no solution to the conflict in Syria until he is pushed out with his team. His speech is continuing the war against the Syrian people,"" said George Sabra, vice president of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. In a statement, the opposition coalition described the speech as a ""preemptive strike against both Arab and international diplomatic solutions."" Al-Assad is incapable of coming up with a viable political solution to the crisis, the opposition coalition said, because he insists on remaining in power ""despite being rejected by his people and his traditional allies."" But just as he has throughout Syria's 22-month uprising, al-Assad refused to acknowledge the widespread movement inside his country seeking an end to four decades of his family's rule. He claimed many of the opposition fighters are not Syrians, but rather foreign terrorists bent on destabilizing the nation. ""We are facing an external attack against us, which is more dangerous than any other previous wars,"" he said. ""We are dealing with those who are extremists, who only know the language of killing and criminality."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague described al-Assad's speech as ""beyond hypocritical."" ""Deaths, violence and oppression engulfing #Syria are his own making, empty promises of reform fool no one,"" Hague tweeted. Similarly, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland criticized al-Assad's speech, saying it was ""yet another attempt by the regime to cling to power and does nothing to advance the Syrian people's goal of a political transition."" Al-Assad has ""lost all legitimacy and must step aside,"" she said. As the president spoke, the violence carried on unabated. ""I have heard 10 shells fall during the speech,"" resident Mohammed Doumany told CNN from Douma, a suburb of Damascus. Heavy shelling from missile launchers also hit the Damascus suburb of Mesraba during the speech, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The opposition group reported that at least 101 people were killed in violence across the country on Sunday. The president's address, carried live on state-run TV, was al-Assad's first since June. Since then, tens of thousands of Syrians have been killed, and the country appears no closer to a resolution. During his last publicized speech in June, al-Assad called for unity. ""We are in a state of real war, in every aspect of the words. And when we're in a state of war, all of our politics has to be concentrated on winning this war,"" al-Assad said at the time. But during the seven months since, reports from inside Syria suggest rebels are gaining ground. The battles between al-Assad's forces and rebels are raging closer to the president's doorstep, with some of the fiercest fighting taking place near Damascus. More than 60,000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war, according to the United Nations. The crisis, which started in March 2011, began when peaceful anti-government protests led to a fierce crackdown by the government and spiraled into and armed uprising and civil war. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of daily violence inside Syria, because the government has restricted access by journalists. In an open letter Friday, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, head of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, implored the U.N. Security Council and world leaders to take action. ""Our people are subjected to genocide, and our country is being destroyed as the international silence is only encouraging the regime to commit more crimes against humanity,"" he wrote. ""Halting massacres in Syria is an international obligation everyone should bear responsibility for.""

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama returned to Washington on Wednesday and plunged into a newly energized political debate over how to shrink the chronic federal deficit and debt in the wake of his stronger-than-expected re-election victory. Tuesday's election results effectively preserved the political status quo, with Obama winning a second term and Republicans holding their majority in the U.S. House while Democrats keeping control of the Senate. The looming question was whether freedom from having to face the voters again would prompt Obama to push harder for a compromise that might anger core liberal supporters. At the same time, Republicans stung by their defeat in the presidential race and their inability to seize the Senate faced pressure from inside and outside the party to soften their fierce partisanship and adopt more moderate positions that might bring about agreement on tough issues. Obama makes history again . The nation faces a ""fiscal cliff"" -- a combination of expiring tax cuts and required, across-the-board spending reductions set to occur at the end of the year absent a congressional deal to avert it. Economists warn that allowing the full impact of the fiscal cliff to occur would further slow an already sluggish recovery, while failure to address the deficit issue in a comprehensive way could bring another downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Posturing by both sides on Wednesday professed a conciliatory approach but offered little movement from hardline positions that have stymied past negotiations on a broad deficit reduction deal. A White House statement said Obama launched the discussion on arguably the most pressing challenge facing his administration by phoning key congressional leaders Wednesday, including the top Republican in both the House and Senate. Obama ""reiterated his commitment to finding bipartisan solutions to: reduce our deficit in a balanced way, cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses and create jobs,"" the statement said. World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms . ""The president said he believed that the American people sent a message in yesterday's election that leaders in both parties need to put aside their partisan interests and work with common purpose to put the interests of the American people and the American economy first,"" it continued. One of those who spoke with the president, House Speaker John Boehner, issued his own statement later Wednesday. In it, he challenged Obama to work with Republicans on negotiating a comprehensive plan to reduce spending, lower tax rates while eliminating tax loopholes, and reform entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. ""We want you to lead, not as a liberal or a conservative, but as president of the United States of America,"" said Boehner, R-Ohio. ""We want you to succeed. Let's challenge ourselves to find the common ground that has eluded us. Let's rise above the dysfunction and do the right thing together for our country."" However, Boehner specifically opposed a core Obama tax proposal that was a major theme of his election campaign -- restoring higher tax rates from the 1990s on individuals who make more than $250,000. The conservative Boehner also made clear that Obama and the nation should drop any thought of reaching a comprehensive agreement in coming weeks, and he called instead for laying the foundation for difficult but necessary negotiations next year when the new Congress starts work. ""We won't solve the problem of our fiscal unbalance overnight and certainly won't do it in a lame duck session of Congress,"" Boehner said. ""And it won't be solved simply by raising taxes or taking a plunge off the fiscal cliff."" Opinion: Five things Obama must do . Obama's election victory in a campaign based in part on his call for wealthy Americans to contribute more to reduce the federal deficit gives him a negotiating advantage over Boehner, analysts said. Boehner was ""trying to do the best he can with a very weak hand,"" said CNN contributor Reihan Salam. Conservatives seek to shrink the size of government and therefore oppose additional revenue from taxes. Boehner tried to sound willing to compromise on Wednesday by saying he'd be open to a comprehensive plan resulting in more revenue, but not from higher taxes. He offered a similar proposal to vanquished Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who argued during the campaign for tax reform that lowered rates for everyone and eliminated some loopholes and deductions to promote economic growth that mean more government revenue. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Wednesday that the election results showed that most Americans want the wealthy to pay a larger share toward resolving the nation's fiscal problems. ""It is better to dance than to fight. It is better to work together,"" Reid told a news conference. ""Everything doesn't have to be a fight. That is the way it's been the last couple of years. Everyone should comprehend, especially my Senate friends, that legislation is the art of compromise. It is consensus building."" Analysis: Obama won with a better ground game . On Tuesday night, Obama told euphoric supporters in Chicago that ""you voted for action, not politics as usual."" Romney, absorbing defeat after a historically expensive race on both sides, issued a similar call in his concession speech. ""The nation, as you know, is at a critical point,"" he said. ""At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing. Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work."" Former President Bill Clinton predicted weeks ago that an Obama victory would be the key to ending the gridlock in Washington. Every administration needs ""an action-forcing event,"" he told CNN, adding: ""I believe the election will be that event. I expect the president to win. And I think if he does, after this happens, then you will see the logjam begin to break."" Republican strategist Ana Navarro, a CNN contributor, echoed that message Wednesday. ""President Obama's re-election does two things. It frees President Obama to be able to work with the Republican Congress, and it frees the Republican Congress to be able to work with President Obama,"" Navarro said. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter summed it up succinctly. ""The election is over. It's time for governing and making things happen,"" he told CNN. That means bringing Obama's signature campaign word -- ""forward"" -- to fruition. ""Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny,"" the president said in his victory speech early Wednesday, ""the task of perfecting our union moves forward.""

"(CNN) -- NATO foreign ministers have approved Turkey's request for Patriot missiles to defend its borders, a statement of ""solidarity"" with its fellow alliance member. ""Today NATO agreed to augment Turkey's air defense by deploying Patriot missiles to Turkey. Turkey has asked for NATO's support and we stand with Turkey in the spirit of strong solidarity,"" said NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. ""To Turkish people we say, we are determined to defend you and your territory. To anyone who would want to attack Turkey, we say, don't even think about it. "" The move is in response to the spilling over of the Syrian civil war into Turkey, where errant Syrian artillery shells struck the border town of Akcakale and killed five Turkish civilians in October. Turkey asked NATO to deploy Patriot missiles along its border to bolster its air defenses against Syrian threats. Syrian family hides from attacks in underground 'prison' The United States, Germany and Netherlands, which all have Patriot capabilities, have signaled they would be willing to contribute missiles. Rasmussen believes the ""actual deployment will take place within weeks."" ""We welcome the intention of Germany, the Netherlands and the United States to provide Patriot missile batteries, subject to their respective national procedures. These systems will be under the operational command of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Any deployment will be defensive only. It will in no way support a no-fly zone or any offensive operation,"" Rasmussen said. The decision was made as news surfaced about fears of Bashar al-Assad's government using chemical weapons. Rasmussen echoed warnings from U.S. President Barack Obama that the Syrian government may be toying with the idea of using chemical weapons to crush the 21-month rebellion. ""The Syrian stockpiles of chemical weapons are a matter of great concern,"" Rasmussen told reporters. ""We know that Syria possesses missiles. We know they have chemical weapons and, of course, they also have to be included in our calculations. And this is also the reason why it is a matter of urgency to ensure effective defense and protection of our ally Turkey,"" he said. Opinion: Rape is shredding Syria's social fabric . ""Let me add to this that the possible use of chemical weapons would be completely unacceptable for the whole international community, and if anybody resorts to these terrible weapons I would expect an immediate reaction from the international community."" Violence raged Tuesday in Syria, with at least 155 people killed across the country, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. In one key development, rebel fighters scored a major gain where government forces once ruled. The rebels have cut off a sprawling military base outside Aleppo with some 450 government soldiers trapped inside. The rebels could easily overrun the base, fighter Ali Jadlan said, but they want to give government soldiers a chance to defect. Already, about 250 soldiers have defected from units at the base since the Syrian uprising began in 2011, and most of them have joined the opposition. It's another indication al-Assad is losing his grip on a country he once firmly commanded. As fighting subsides, Aleppo residents find little left . The government has tried air-dropping food to its soldiers, often missing the targets. Opposition fighters have shot out their water supply. While the soldiers still have stockpiles of artillery, their options are dwindling. ""They have reached a point where they think that they can't go back,"" said Jamal, a defector. ""They have reached a dead end. Slowly, they are weakening."" In another incident, rebels and the government are reporting deadly shelling on a school in a refugee camp in the Damascus area. The LCC said 30 students were killed there. Alexia Jade, a spokeswoman for the opposition in Damascus, said the school was ""showered by mortars leaving between eight and 12 dead, including children and a teacher."" ""I cannot say if this area was state loyal,"" she said, adding it was very remote and inhabited by refugees from the Golan Heights whose kin had suffered from government shelling in the south of the capital. ""We have not reached a concrete conclusion at this point"" about who fired the shells, Jade added. Syrian refugees face brutal winter with inadequate shelter and food . Rasmussen stressed that a Patriot missile deployment will be ""purely defensive"" and that NATO has ""no intention to prepare offensive operations."" The deployment would be an ""effective deterrent"" and de-escalate tensions along the border, he said. Such a deployment would compel ""any potential aggressor to think twice before they even consider attacking Turkey."" A Russian official, speaking with CNN on background, claimed the Patriot systems are more symbolic than militarily necessary. Russia has been a friend of the Syrian government over the years and has blocked tough action against the al-Assad government in the U.N. Security Council. Echoing comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin, the official said Syria has no interest in attacking Turkey. Concern over the issue has rippled across the world. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said before NATO moved on the issue that deploying Patriot missiles is a ""good decision. We shall support it. "" He noted ""many attacks by Syria against Turkish borders."" ""Turkey has asked for protection,"" he said. ""We are deciding to grant this protection through Patriot missiles."" As for the chemical weapons issue, the Syrian Foreign Ministry denied that the country has any plans to use such arms, state TV reported. The government has also repeatedly stressed it will not use such weapons, if they exist, against its people under any circumstances. But U.S. officials say ""worrying signs"" suggest otherwise. Syrian forces have started combining chemicals that could be used to make deadly sarin gas for weapons to attack rebel and civilian populations, one U.S. official said. The intelligence, obtained over the weekend, the official said, came from multiple sources. But the official declined to provide more details about how the United States learned of it. Sarin gas, the source said, could most readily be used to fill artillery shells. Obama said Monday that ""the use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable. And if you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons, there will be consequences, and you will be held accountable."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel and the world community are ""closely monitoring the developments in Syria regarding the stockpiles of chemical weapons."" ""I heard the important things President Obama said on this matter, we are of a single mind. It is forbidden to use these weapons and it should be forbidden to pass them on to terror elements,"" he said. U.S. concerned Syria 'cooking up recipes' for chemical weapons . CNN's Arwa Damon, Nick Paton-Walsh, Holly Yan, Gul Tuysuz, Barbara Starr, and Jill Dougherty, along with Journalist Ammar Cheikhomar, contributed to this report.","155 Syrians are dead Tuesday, including 30 in a shelling at a school, the LCC says .

"(CNN) -- Since the revolution which ousted former president Hosni Mubarak from power after 30 years, the world has grown accustomed to seeing Egyptian revolutionaries protesting on the streets of Cairo. But there is another, less well-known group of protesters on the streets these days -- pro-Mubarak supporters, who gather, wearing T-shirts with slogans and holding up pictures of Mubarak, proclaiming their support for the ex-president. They call themselves the ""Sons of Mubarak"" -- men and women, rich and poor -- ardent supporters of the former president, who believe he deserves respect and is innocent of charges of corruption and killing protesters. Offended by the ousting of Mubarak, they say insulting the former president is like insulting Egypt. Mubarak's trial resumes Monday and he could face the death penalty if convicted. On the two occasions when Mubarak previously appeared in court in August at the Police Academy, wheeled into a courtroom cage on a hospital gurney, hundreds of the Sons gathered outside. They chanted: ""Oh Mubarak, hold your head high"" ... ""We will demolish the prison and burn it down, if Hosni Mubarak is sentenced."" During his second appearance, on August 15, tensions between the Sons and anti-Mubarak protesters flared into violence. Under the blazing sun, hundreds of Mubarak's opponents and supporters threw rocks at each other, leaving dozens injured. Mostly men and a few women, and of all age groups and social backgrounds, the Sons are well organized and immediately recognizable by their T-shirts, which say in Arabic: ""I am Egyptian, and I refuse to insult the nation's leader."" ""We are supporting the president in a peaceful manner,"" said engineer Dalia Saleh, a founding member of the group. There are 30 founding members and the group's Facebook page ""We are sorry, Mr. President"" has more than 100,000 followers, many of whom have participated in the group's regular charity events and the protests, according to Saleh. Asem Abu El Kheir, another founding member of the group created the Facebook page on February 26, the day after the Egyptian revolution started because of ""the images of protesters waving their shoes, and burning posters of Mubarak"" he saw. ""It was total disrespect of a war hero,"" he said. Magdi Fouda, an Egyptian journalist and the group's media coordinator claims there are still many supporters of Mubarak in Egypt, but that they are too scared to support him openly. ""The media does not give us a voice and many Mubarak supporters want to take to the streets but are scared for their well-being. ""We were all hurt by the treatment of President Mubarak, he is no dictator and insulting him is insulting Egypt,"" said Fouda at one of the group's weekly meetings, in a Cairo coffee shop. They also meet in their homes to discuss strategy and divide tasks. Many in Egypt see the group as a remnant of the former regime, although the Sons of Mubarak deny links. Some Egyptians even accuse them of being delusional. Ashraf Nagi, an anti-Mubarak protester, said: ""They showed up outside State TV carrying one expensive huge birthday cake on May 4th to celebrate Mubarak's 83rd birthday. They are crazy."" Many Egyptians also believe that the Sons of Mubarak are funded externally, perhaps by the United States or Israel, who they think have an interest in supporting Western-friendly Mubarak. It is an accusation the group denies. ""If we had external funding, we would have rounded up millions of people in Tahrir (Square, during the revolution) like they did,"" said Fouda. ""Our money comes from internal donations by group members, who are professionals who came together spontaneously. ""That is where we get money to print 1,000 T-shirts and posters,"" he added. The Sons refuse to use the word revolution to describe the events that led to Mubarak stepping down earlier this year and, they say, none of them protested in Tahrir Square -- the heart of the Egyptian revolution. Fouda said, while other group members nodded their agreement: ""It's not a revolution because it destroyed the country, has no cohesive leader, and disrespects the ethics of our kind Egyptian society."" Fouda accuses Islamist movements of hijacking the revolution: ""The protesters who took the streets on January 25 were decent, people, calling for change and reform. ""But, others rode the wave ... like the Muslim Brotherhood, and certain liberal movements too. Leaders such as Dr. Safwat Hegazy of the Muslim Brotherhood and Dr. Ayman Nour of the el-Ghad (liberal secular) political parties fed the protesters their personal demands."" The Sons of Mubarak deny the former regime's involvement in violence directed against protesters during the revolution, particularly the now-infamous ""Battle of the Camel"" on February 2 when government loyalists rode camels and horses through the protest camp, leaving two dead. A fact-finding judicial committee later found that Safwat Al Sharif, former secretary-general of Mubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP), was among parliamentarians who had hired thugs to attack crowds. ""It (the Battle of the Camel) was all staged by the Muslim Brotherhood,"" according to Fouda. ""That same night, tell me how the Mubarak supporters were able to throw Molotov cocktails from the roof of a building controlled by the anti-Mubarak Muslim Brotherhood?"" he added. The group maintains that they are independent, but some in Egypt accuse Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed El Deeb, of mobilizing and funding them. They include Khaled Abu Bakr, a prosecuting lawyer suing Mubarak on behalf of a man who was shot and badly injured by the security forces during the revolution. ""I believe El Deeb coordinates with former members of the regime and Mubarak's family to fuel some sympathy for the ousted president,"" Abu Bakr said. On August 15, Abu Bakr was beaten and threatened by Sons of Mubarak members while conducting a TV interview outside the Police Academy. CNN was able to acquire photos of the beating. The previous month, El Deeb made a telephone call to CNN to say the Sons of Mubarak -- and what he described as the ""silent majority"" -- were planning a protest in Roxy, an upper-class neighborhood in Cairo. ""You should send a camera to cover it,"" El Deeb said. When asked, Saleh admitted the Sons are in ""constant communication"" with El Deeb, but insisted their relationship with him is based on similar interests. ""We only take his opinion and legal advice to make sure our actions do not harm Mubarak's case,"" Saleh said. The Sons of Mubarak recently started a campaign to mobilize the so-called ""silent majority."" They describe them as the 75 million Egyptians who didn't take to the streets during the revolution -- ""the mothers and elders and their daughters"" who support and love Mubarak yet remain confused on how to express their views. ""We encourage them not to stay silent,"" said Saleh. ""They are scared to voice their opinion or take a step forward."" The group has recently started a charity campaign called ""Mubarak's Good,"" which, they say, donates blood and babysits children in hospitals among other projects. ""Last week, we were able to channel $9,000 donated by our followers on Facebook directly to the account of the Children's Cancer Hospital to assist the treatment of cancer patients in a room now carrying the name Hosni Mubarak,"" claimed Saleh. They are also launching a newspaper called the ""Sun of the Truth"" to ""channel our voice,"" said Fouda. ""It will be distributed for free across all Egypt's districts."" The first issue includes evidence acquired from current government officials, says Fouda, that the number of protesters killed in Tahrir Square during the revolution was ""exaggerated."" The group says they hope Mubarak will be acquitted, but for now they plan to do good deeds in his name and deter any campaigns that tarnish his reputation. Winning the hearts of minds of the Egyptian society may be a challenge. Some members of the group face opposition from within their own families. Sons of Mubarak member Riham Mohamed said: ""My brother and I don't talk at all since January 25 -- he still does not get it, that the energy of the youth was used by external forces."" Members of the group also say they have received threats. Group members showed CNN samples of threatening emails and mobile phone text messages. One text read: ""If you don't stop you will go to prison or be killed. I will see you in the streets."" ""They (the revolutionaries) get our phone numbers off the flyers we distribute and terrorize us,"" Karim Hassan, said while displaying the message on his Blackberry. One upcoming protest it is unlikely the Sons of Mubarak will attend is the ""Revival of the Revolution,"" organized by the January 25 coalition, a group of pro-democracy political parties, planned for September 9. ""We will not attend because we don't want to be used as scapegoats when things turn ugly,"" said Fouda. ""We will be outside the court at Mubarak's next hearing on September 5. I believe he is innocent of all charges."" On Saturday, five Kuwaiti lawyers arrived to Egypt to join the Mubarak defense team. Fouda said: ""We organized a press conference for the five lawyers on Sunday and rented a hall at the Sheraton hotel to give them a chance to explain to the media why they volunteered with this good deed."" ""We are standing beside former president Hosni Mubarak because he stood by us in liberating Kuwait during the invasion and we cannot forget that he stepped down to avoid the bloodshed of his own people, "" Faisal al-Otaibi, one of the Kuwaiti lawyers told CNN at the press conference. The press conference ended with a tense confrontation, which CNN witnessed, between several journalists and members of the Sons until the hotel's security intervened before the police arrived on the scene. ""Several journalists started the problem when they called us 'the thugs of Mubarak,'"" said Fouda.","""Sons of Mubarak"" are ardent supporters of former Egyptian president .

I have a new favorite female sleuth to add to the list, Claire DeWitt. The self-described ""world's greatest private eye"" returns in her second adventure from author Sara Gran in ""Claire DeWitt and the Bohemian Highway"" hitting bookstores this week. Claire is not your typical P.I., and the book is not your run of the mill mystery. Claire is a new age heroine who uses dreams, visions and intuition to uncover clues and close cases. Gran's writing is a mix of the gritty noir tradition in crime writing supplemented with a mystical, dream-like quality -- a sort of hard-boiled surrealism. In the new novel, Claire has moved on from New Orleans, the scene of her last case in ""Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead."" She's now living in San Francisco when called on to investigate the death of a close friend, her musician ex-boyfriend Paul Casablancas. Police are calling his death a robbery gone wrong, but Claire suspects murder. The case hits Claire hard, bringing up unresolved feelings of love. Was Paul the one who got away? Gran says Claire looks at losing Paul ""as a huge mistake that she's made in her life of letting someone go, or maybe it wasn't a mistake, maybe things were better the way they turned out. You just can't know and that's part of what's really hard for Claire, is never really knowing."" As Claire digs deeper into Paul's murder, she's drawn to one of her past cases, another friend, this time a teenage girl, gone missing in 1980s New York. The two cases, past and present, lead Claire into a downward spiral of self-destructive behavior involving drugs and alcohol. Gran says writing about Claire's personal challenges and seeing her change is what she loves most about the series. ""People really do change with the character every book. I think that's a bit of surprise to readers because in most detective series the character is the same in every book. I wish we were like that in real life. Things would probably be better."" Claire is rooted in much of the author's own experience. ""There's a lot that's autobiographical in Claire,"" Gran says. ""Our life stories are really similar. The places where we've lived and our interests, but we're more similar in the small things."" Sadly, Gran says those similarities don't extend to her dreams. ""I wish I had dreams that were so exciting and deep like Claire. I very rarely have dreams that interesting and noteworthy."" Readers will get a kick out of Claire's method of crime-solving, a mix of mystical and new age philosophy, Buddhism and Hindu beliefs. It's also rooted in the writings of a fictional French detective, Jacques Silette, whose instruction tends to the cryptic. A typical piece of advice from Silette reads, ""A clue is a word in another language and mysteries speak the language of dreams."" Makes perfect sense, no? Some readers, me included, will latch onto the Carlos Castaneda like tangents of ""Claire DeWitt."" Others are just in it for the mystery, and Gran is fine with that, too. ""A lot of people just gloss over all the spiritual and philosophical stuff in the books, and they just read them as mysteries, which is OK,"" she said. ""I'm fine with people reading the book like that, but it is nice to hear from readers who appreciate that aspect of it."" Gran says she's borrowed from several different schools of psychology and religion, things she finds personally interesting, to come up with Claire's world view. She calls it a reflection of her own upbringing, which she says wasn't limited to just one faith. ""I was not raised as a member of any particular religion. My parents were always saying decide for yourself, think for yourself, think about what you believe in. So all those things are sort of equal to me,"" she said. ""I always feel like whenever you learn something great it's OK to borrow that. I know some people don't agree and feel like you should stick with one philosophy or one religion, but that's never really been an option for me."" On the other hand, Gran says Claire is very single-minded in her goal as a detective, uncovering the truth. ""From Claire's point of view solving a mystery and solving a crime are two different things. Solving a crime is what police and other detectives do, and they can do that better than her. She's not interested in that. What she does is solve mysteries, which is restoring truth to a situation."" Gran is already working on Claire's next mystery, and she has a fourth book in mind. A Brooklyn native now living in Los Angeles, she also writes for film and TV, including a past gig on the TNT drama ""Southland."" Gran says she enjoys both. ""Writing books is a very solitary activity while working for TV is very collaborative. If I only did TV, I would go crazy although I did only write books for so long it's been really nice for me to take a break and work with a group of people and not have everything be on my shoulders in terms of telling the story."" Gran also says there's a ""Claire DeWitt"" TV series in the works. She's working on a pilot script with producer John Wells, one of the creative forces behind past hits ""ER"" and ""The West Wing."" For all the mysticism, the philosophical jags, the hard-boiled behavior, the series is easy to read and fun. Neither Gran nor Claire takes themselves too seriously, just take a look at the names of some of Claire's past cases, including, 'The Case of the Kleptomaniacal Occultist"" or ""The Case of the Missing Miniature Horses."" Asked to boil down Claire's code as ""the world's greatest P.I."" into one sentence, Gran says, ""Trust yourself. That's it in a nutshell.""

"(CNN) -- Two days after Islamist militants abducted an undetermined number of hostages -- including Westerners -- at a gas plant in a remote section of Algeria, ""ongoing activity at various locations"" was continuing, a British official said Friday. It was not clear whether that activity represented ""mopping up and checking"" or ""something more active"" being carried out by Algerian forces against the abductors, the official told CNN. Algerian forces launched their operation upon noticing the hostages being moved toward ""a neighboring country,"" where kidnappers could use them ""as a means of blackmail with criminal intent,"" Algerian Communications Minister Mohamed Said told state television on Thursday. The British official said there was a ""significant"" number of British victims and others were unaccounted for. British Foreign Secretary William Hague was to release more information Friday from Australia, and a parliamentary statement will be issued, the official said. The official's account was in line with Prime Minister David Cameron's warning of ""bad news ahead"" issued late Thursday . Algerian troops fired on at least two SUVs trying to leave the kidnapping site, Algerian radio said, citing local sources. And an Algerian reporter saw clashes near the site, the Algerian Press Service and radio reports said. ""There were a number of dead and injured, we don't have a final figure,"" Said reported. Earlier, Algeria's state media reported that all Algerian nationals who had been held hostage were free: some had fled, while others were released. The hostages still detained are foreigners, Algerian Interior Minister Dahou Ould Kablia said. In addition to the hundreds of freed workers, 30 Algerian workers escaped and were picked up by helicopters, the APS report said. Nearly 600 workers and four foreign nationals -- two Scots, a Kenyan and a French citizen -- were free by late Thursday after the Algerian military operation, the state-run Algerian Press Service reported. But some hostages were still presumably being held. ""It is a fluid situation, it is ongoing,"" Cameron told the Reuters news agency. ""I think we should be prepared for the possibility of further bad news, very difficult news, in this extremely difficult situation."" The Algerian military operation led to numerous casualties and was over by Thursday evening, the Algerian Press Service said. But U.S. and British officials predicted it would resume Friday during the day. ""There are still hostages, and there are still terrorists,"" a senior U.S. official said. ""So tomorrow is another day."" Two people -- an Algerian and British national -- died Wednesday when the Islamist militants attacked, the same news agency said. The Algerians and foreign workers were taken hostage early Wednesday in an assault carried out apparently in response to France's offensive in neighboring Mali. The gas field is 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of the Libyan border and 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles) from the Algerian capital, Algiers. The kidnappers were equipped with AK-47 rifles and put explosives-laden vests on some of the hostages, a U.S. State Department official said. Islamists take foreign hostages in attack on Algerian oil field . On Wednesday, the attackers had put the number of hostages at ""more than 40,"" including seven Americans, two French, two British and other Europeans. Another Islamist group told the Mauritanian News Agency there were 41 ""Westerners."" The APS, though, reported that slightly more than 20 foreign nationals were being held. Officials from Norway, the United States, Japan and Britain said some of their nationals were among the hostages. Three workers for a Japanese engineering company that was working on the site had been contacted and were safe, said Takeshi Endo, a senior manager for JGC Corp. But the company had not been able to contact 14 others, he said. ""There is so much conflicting information on safety of the hostages,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo. ""Safety of 14 Japanese citizens still remains unknown."" He said Japanese officials had urged the Algerian government to avoid exposing the hostages to danger. ""We are terribly disappointed about the Algerian's military operation,"" he said. Nine Norwegian employees of Statoil were unaccounted for, while five Norwegian nationals -- as well as three Algerians -- who work for the company were safe, the company said in a statement. CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported that a French nurse who was working on the site at the time of the attack was freed. Former hostage Stephen McFaul had plastic explosives strapped around his neck, duct tape over his mouth and rope around his hands, his brother Brian McFaul told CNN from Belfast. McFaul made a break for freedom after the vehicle he was in -- one of several targeted by Algerian fighters -- crashed, with the explosives still around his neck. ""The joy was unreal,"" Brian McFaul said upon hearing his brother was safe. ""I haven't seen my mother move as fast in all my life, and my mother smile as much, hugging each other ... You couldn't describe the feeling."" Americans were among the hostages at the In Amenas facility in Algeria, White House spokesman Jay Carney said without specifying how many. There could be as few as three American hostages, two U.S. officials said Wednesday. One of the kidnapped Americans is a Texas man, a family member told CNN. By Thursday night, some Americans had been freed and had spoken with relatives back home, while others remained unaccounted for, U.S. officials said. ""This incident will be resolved -- we hope -- with a minimum loss of life,"" said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""But when you deal with these relentless terrorists, life is not in any way precious to them."" The man behind the group claiming responsibility for the attack and kidnappings is a veteran jihadist known for seizing hostages. Moktar Belmoktar, an Algerian who lost an eye fighting in Afghanistan in his teens, has long been a target of French counterterrorism forces. Libyan sources said he spent several months in Libya in 2011, exploring cooperation with local jihadist groups and securing weapons. Two oil companies that operated at the site -- BP and Statoil -- said they were pulling non-essential personnel from Algeria. ""Our focus is 100 percent on the safety and welfare of those people and their families, and we are now beginning a staged and planned reduction in non-essential workforce on a temporary basis, pulling them out of the country,"" said BP Vice President Peter Maher from London. The militants said they carried out the operation because Algeria allowed French forces to use its air space in attacking Islamist militants in Mali. Media in the region reported that the attackers issued a statement demanding an end to ""brutal aggression on our people in Mali"" and cited ""blatant intervention of the French crusader forces in Mali."" U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in Europe meeting with NATO allies, called the hostage-taking ""a terrorist act."" Japan and the United Kingdom sent officials to Algeria. French President Francois Hollande earlier confirmed the presence of French citizens on the site but would not say whether any were hostages. Cameron -- who canceled a planned Friday speech in the Netherlands -- talked Thursday with U.S. President Barack Obama about the situation, according to a Downing Street statement. Before Algeria launched its military operation, U.S. officials had urged the Algerians to be cautious and make the hostages' safety their first priority, an Obama administration official said. Algerian government officials did not warn their U.S. counterparts about the raid, the official said. A senior U.S. official said U.S. officials did not trust the information they were getting from the Algerians, ""because we hear one thing and then we hear something else."" Though there was concern that the Algerians' tactics may have put hostages in jeopardy, the official acknowledged they could have hit even harder. ""In all fairness, they could have ended it today,"" the senior U.S. official said. ""They haven't used all the severeness they could. They know hostages are left."" CNN's Tom Watkins, Joe Sterling and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Dan Rivers, Elise Labott, David Mattingly, Athena Jones, Barbara Starr, Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister and Faith Karimi contributed to this report, as did journalists Peter Taggert from Belfast and Said Ben Ali from Algiers.","British official says there is ""ongoing activity at various locations"" near gas plant in Algeria .

"(CNN) -- A Milwaukee woman accused of killing a pregnant mother and her unborn son just days before he was due to be born was charged Monday with two counts of homicide. Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 33, is accused of killing 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz and then cutting the baby from her womb last week, according to police and a criminal complaint. It was not immediately clear Monday whether the defendant had obtained legal representation. Morales-Rodriguez, who first tried to pass the child off as her own, allegedly told police that her boyfriend wanted a son and that she could not get pregnant. She had told her boyfriend she was expecting. As her alleged due date drew near, Morales-Rodriguez began to panic and went in search of a pregnant woman, the complaint read. She meant to take the woman's baby and make it hers. Morales-Rodriguez had not met Ramirez-Cruz prior to last week, when she offered the pregnant woman a ride in her car, according to the complaint. Under the pretext of needing to change her shoes, the defendant drove Ramirez-Cruz to her home, where she hit the victim several times in the head with a baseball bat, the complaint says. After Ramirez-Cruz fell down, Morales-Rodriguez choked her until she was no longer conscious, it says. The defendant then used a knife to cut Ramirez-Cruz's abdomen, according to the complaint. ""She cut Maritza at the bikini line attempting to duplicate the process she had seen on the Discovery Channel, depicting a cesarean section birth,"" it read. When Morales-Rodriguez removed the baby, it was not breathing. She then called 911 and told authorities she had just given birth to a child in the shower. However, an autopsy on the baby, which was between 38 and 42 weeks, revealed it was not the product of a natural birth, but had been cut out by force. Morales-Rodriguez was arrested late last week and remains in custody at the Milwaukee County Jail. CNN affiliate WTMJ said that Ramirez-Cruz was expected to give birth on October 16. She and her husband had planned to name the child Omar, the network reported.","Annette Morales-Rodriguez faces two homicide counts .

"(CNN) -- When Pinterest exploded onto the scene, enthusiasts could barely contain their excitement over pages upon pages of pastel, lace-trimmed, sugar-sprinkled DIY deliciousness. It was the manifestation of our collective consciousness of intended crafts. We spent hours pinning, as if the action itself were a legitimate replacement for actual creation. Who doesn't want to know how to make Skittles-infused vodka (""Vomit the rainbow"") or create an anytime jersey dress out of an oversized T-shirt? Again, we weren't exactly creating most of these items, but knowing they were safely tucked away within meticulously organized virtual boards was enough to make us feel like creative maestros. For parents, Pinterest took things to a whole ... 'nother ... level. One could pass days falling down the rabbit hole of ideas spanning every milestone of child rearing. From the time-lapse pregnancy photo montage to gender-reveal cupcakes to lunchbox hand-pies shaped like baby octopi, Pinterest left no familial event untouched. Suddenly, a rumbling in the distance. An overwhelming tide began to rise. It's not that these ideas were overly complicated. There were just so many of them. All demanding attention, crying out for a voyage to the craft store, begging to be manifested into fruition. What's wrong with using tech to distract kids? Initially, I'd managed to stay on the shore and watch Pinthusiasts sink or swim from a distance. Pinterest didn't infect me during any of the traditional gateway holidays like Christmas or Halloween (did you know both of these holidays now require wreaths?). It got me with the Tooth Fairy. When I was kid, the Tooth Fairy, if the wench remembered to come all, would leave a quarter. Maybe 50 cents if she was having a good year. A 2012 survey reported that American parents give their children $3 per tooth, so even considering 20 years of inflation, my fairy was obviously from the wrong side of the tracks. When I was a child, my mom was studying to become a dentist. Maybe to her, the idea of celebrating calcified structures separating from mouth tissue seemed like overkill. These days, a quick ""Tooth Fairy"" search on Pinterest will result in thousands of ways to turn what should be a very simple transaction into an event worthy of a Disney score. I'm not sure what it is about this specific milestone that had me feeling all romantic, but I knew Pinterest would be the place to go for inspiration. By the time my oldest daughter's first tooth was threatening to wriggle free, I'd hyped up the Tooth Fairy significantly. ""What do you think she'll bring? I hope it's not money. I don't like money,"" she said as I pulled her comforter to her chin. ""Me too?"" my 3-year-old worriedly asked from her bed across the room. ""I'm not sure what she's going to bring. And she never forgets little sisters,"" I explained. Eventually, the tooth fell out during breakfast. Unfortunately, as the day went on, the business of life combined with my chronic tendency to procrastinate proved more powerful than the Pinterest-derived Tooth Fairy extravaganza I'd planned. I didn't remember the Fairy's scheduled visit until I woke up with a massive start at 2 a.m. the next day. I'd dropped the ball. My mind started to race with ideas. Perhaps the gas station around the corner had candy ... wait no, the Tooth Fairy wouldn't give candy; that'd be like a doctor handing out Big Macs. And do I really want to get on the road at 2 a.m. when the bars are closing? What if there are drunken drivers? I don't want to go down as the first Pinterest-related death. I began opening every closet in my home, searching the pantry for something that I could pass off as a gift from an enchanted forest warehouse. I found a few mini candy canes, but no, the tooth fairy would clearly be non-denominational. Maybe I could make sandwiches shaped like hearts and keep them in the fridge -- no, the present is supposed to be under their pillow. Shaved turkey slices on whole wheat have no place in a child's bedding; even I know that. I finally found some snack mix that I was sure my kids hadn't seen before. Combined with a few chocolate chips ... that's something the Tooth Fairy would whip together in her Middle-Earth kitchen, right? As I prepared the melange and dumped it into sandwich bags, I got a distinct mental picture of a jury of Pinterest moms in cardigans shaking their heads at me while knitting stuffed animals. ""Groceries? Really?"" their leader said. She was wearing a T-shirt dress. It looked amazing on her. I glanced down sheepishly at my work. The bags looked like something you'd sneak into a movie theater to save $5. Not magical enough. I closed the bags with craft twine and finished the whole debacle with wrapping paper. What about a note? There are hundreds of pins featuring little notes written with what I can only assume are calligraphy pens. People even make matching miniature envelopes. It was almost 2:30. No time for that. After I'd dropped the packages, being careful not to wake the children (how would that go? ""Oh I was just seeing the Tooth Fairy out ...""), I still felt uneasy. You're only a kid once. It's fun to believe in this nonsense. I decided to take it up a notch by sprinkling some pink glitter by their bedsides and made a trail all the way to the upstairs bathroom window. No, I hadn't been drinking or using recreational drugs. It just felt right at the time. By now, I was so tired that I was having a semi-out-of-body experience and felt like I really was the Tooth Fairy. Glitter clean-up? I'd have one of the lesser fairies take care of it the next day. It will be good for their rÃ©sumÃ©s. About 3 a.m., I remembered seeing a website where you can superimpose pictures of a fairy on a photo of your sleeping child. Knowing that nothing would traumatize my youngest daughter more than a visual of an otherworldly creature walking on her face while she lay unconscious, I took a photo of a windowsill upstairs instead. For the low price of $7, I added what looked like a crouching Barbie doll wearing a cheap prom dress and wings. As I lay in bed, I created an elaborate backstory of how I'd managed to take the photo with my iPhone right before she spit in my face for scaring her. Come morning, the children were as excited as could be to find their plastic food bags beside their beds. ""There is fairy dust everywhere!"" they shouted from upstairs. The photo was the icing on the cake. I'm still trying to decide what the Tooth Fairy will bring the next time she pays a visit. Maybe a gift card.","Honest Toddler's Bunmi Laditan says Pinterest has created unrealistic expectations .

"(CNN) -- As Justin Rose emerged onto the 18th fairway and saw his ball just yards from the spot where Ben Hogan fired his famous one iron to the green in 1950, he knew it was his moment to seize the U.S. Open crown. The 32-year-old knew if he could repeat Hogan's par on the notoriously tricky 18th hole at Merion in Pennsylvania he could end England's 43-year wait for a champion in America's national championship. With thoughts of his late father Ken swirling round his mind, Rose struck a near-perfect approach shot and duly completed par. When Phil Mickelson failed to birdie the same hole moments later, Rose had sealed his first major triumph. It meant success at the 37th time of asking for Rose, who became the first Englishman to win a major since Nick Faldo's Masters success in 1996. ""I just had to stand up there and be counted,"" he told CNN World Sport. ""It was a major, it was my moment, it was stand up and deliver. ""It was a special moment when I walked over the hill and saw my ball sitting right there on the up slope in the middle of the fairway. ""Hogan definitely popped into my mind because I know he hit the green and two-putted to get into a playoff. ""Someone had chirped from the crowd 'Rose, a good iron shot, two putts and its yours.' And in a sense that was all I was trying to do at that point."" Rose held his nerve at the end of a day that fluctuated wildly, as crowd favorite Phil Mickelson desperately tried to nail down victory in a tournament he had finished runner up in five times. An audacious chip in for eagle from Mickleson at the tenth hole swung the momentum his way but Rose responded immediately, with birdies at the 12th and 13th. And as he negotiated the fiendishly difficult closing stretch of holes in just one-over-par, it left Mickelson needing a birdie on the last to force a playoff. He couldn't, which left an emotional Rose with his own special moment on Father's Day, as he remembered his dad Ken, who lost his battle with cancer in 2002. ""I've thought about my dad quite a bit this week,"" Rose explained to Living Golf anchor Shane O'Donoghue. ""Saturday I was driving to the course and I looked in the rear view mirror and saw my eyes and that was one thing my dad always knew -- he could tell by the look in my eyes if I was going to play well or not. ""I thought 'I wonder how my dad thinks I'm going to play today.' I always knew the U.S. Open finishes on Father's Day and I'd been in contention most of the week and I really wanted that moment I could share with him and honor him. ""He sacrificed so much for me and taught me the game. I've seen Rory (McIlroy) celebrate with his dad, G-Mac (Graeme McDowell) celebrate with his dad. ""I've always thought that moment must just be so special and for me, today, it was special in my own way."" The new world No. 3 burst onto the scene as an amateur at the 1998 British Open when he finished fourth. But that early promise stalled as he missed 21 cuts in a row after turning professional. He has steadily been working his way towards the summit of the game with notable victories on the PGA Tour and a stellar showing for Europe in the Ryder Cup at Medinah last year. But he revealed it is only recently he has felt his game was equipped to capture one of golf's major prizes. ""I've been a pro a long time now -- 14 or 15 years -- but not until recently have I felt truly ready,"" he said. ""You try and kid yourself you are ready but this is one of the first majors I've ever played where I came in knowing if I go about my business I'm going to be hard to beat. ""It's just a really nice feeling to have that cleared off the plate now fairly early and it's a lot of boyhood dreams paying off.""","Justin Rose tells CNN his U.S. Open victory is a boyhood dream come true .

"(CNN) -- It's the most romantic of all settings for a grand slam. Paris in the spring sees the sweeping boulevards and majestic parks of the French capital in full and glorious bloom. Nestled in the chic 16th arrondissement near the Bois de Boulogne, Stade Roland Garros is much loved by spectators and players alike -- a perfect venue for the second major of the season. But for some of the biggest names in tennis, its red clay courts meant only heartbreak and shattered dreams. For them it's the slam that got away. The one missing piece of the jigsaw in an otherwise perfect career. Only seven men in history have achieved the feat of winning all four of the grand slams: Wimbledon, and the United States, Australian and French Opens. Fred Perry was the first, back in the 1930s, while in recent years Andre Agassi, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have joined the exclusive club. Agonizingly short . Pete Sampras, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, however, were left agonizingly short of the career sweep -- and all three missed out because of their inability to excel on the slower surface at the French. Until Federer broke his record, Sampras was the all-time leader with 14 grand slam titles, including seven on the grass at Wimbledon. ""Pistol Pete"" usually blew away the opposition with his trademark big serve and volley game -- but unfortunately at the French Open he had feet of clay and often exited in the early rounds. A semifinal appearance in 1996 was the closest he came to lifting the title, being beaten in straight sets by the eventual winner Yeygeny Kafelnikov of Russia. Looking back on his career, the 41-year-old American still has a nagging regret that he could not adapt his formidable talents to clay court play. ""I could have worked a little harder,"" he told CNN's Open Court show. ""I mean I worked hard but you always look back at your career and feel I should have done."" Stubborn Sampras . Legendary tennis journalist and broadcaster Bud Collins told CNN that the match against Kafelnikov summed up Sampras' problems on clay. ""He was playing really well against him then reverted to his old serve and volley type and his chance was gone. ""He was stubborn about it. He was going to be Pete Sampras and it didn't work out."" Of the three, it was Edberg who came closest to adding the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy to his impressive haul. ""I think we all tried to win the French Open and we all tried to prepare the best way we could,"" the 47-year-old told CNN. In the 1989 final he faced a 17-year-old Michael Chang and was heavy favorite, despite the American teenager's incredible heroics en route to the title match. Edberg led by two sets to one and looked set to end Chang's fairytale, but could not finish it off. ""It was a match that maybe I should have won, I was in the lead but somehow he got out of the grip and he won in five sets,"" he recalls. Edberg denied . Chang became the youngest grand slam winner in history, but Edberg did not begrudge him his moment of triumph -- the Swede believed he would have other opportunities to win in Paris. ""At the time I thought I played a great tournament and I thought I would get another chance to win it, but I never really got another chance after that,"" he added with some regret. Collins believes the six-time grand slam winner was just unfortunate to have run into an inspired opponent. ""Edberg had a good shot, but it was just Chang's tournament."" Edberg enjoyed his greatest triumphs at Wimbledon -- where he was twice champion and once a losing finalist -- and maybe a clue to his French Open failures lay in his underlying attitude to the clay-court grand slam. ""I knew that I wasn't going to get my best results on the clay, but at the same time I saw it as a preparation for Wimbledon as well,"" he said. ""The more matches I could play on the clay and get ready physically, you know the easier it was on the grass."" In that respect he was similar to Becker, with whom he enjoyed a titanic rivalry at Wimbledon, meeting in three straight finals. Becker's disappointment . But Becker's style of play was even more unsuited to clay-court perfection, which requires patience and skill and long baseline rallies. Nicknamed ""Boom Boom"" because of his massive service and crunching ground strokes, he just could not adapt -- despite having grown up playing on clay courts. ""Clay was difficult because it was against my personality,"" he admitted. ""On clay you win by making less mistakes, on any other surface you win by making more winners. ""I am not a guy that waits for the opponent to miss. So psychologically it was always difficult for me to play on clay."" But despite his perceived disadvantages, it was not for want of trying to claim his place in tennis history. ""Trust me, I tried everything to win. ""I reached finals, semifinals of big clay-court tournaments and the semifinals of the French three times but I wasn't good enough,"" he told CNN. Those three appearances in 1987, 1989 -- losing in five to Edberg -- and 1991 all ended in disappointment. ""I lost to Mats Wilander, who was better than me on clay, I lost to an Agassi who was better than me,"" he admitted. ""It was just about the quality of play, and my quality of play wasn't good enough to win a major on clay."" Never suited . Becker also won six grand slams in total -- three at Wimbledon, two in Australia and the U.S. Open on his only final appearance -- plus four end-of-season ATP World Championship crowns. Despite his French Open misses, the German superstar refuses to be downbeat about his efforts on the red dirt. ""I can't complain,"" he said. ""Wilander, Agassi and Lendl were better. It wasn't unlucky. They were better."" Collins agrees. ""Boris was just Boris, going to the net, diving around everywhere. I think he felt he was going to make it, but never did."" Edberg, who was also brought up on clay courts in his formative years and swept all the grand slam titles for junior players in 1983, was in Collins' opinion the best suited of the three to sample success in Paris. But his serve and volley tactics could only work to a point as baseliners adapted to his style of play, particularly in the latter stages of the tournament. ""Some players hated playing against me on the clay, but the difficult thing with winning on clay was playing well for two weeks,"" Edberg said. ""You know I could win the tournament for one week, but I think playing serve and volley for two weeks, that was the tough part of it to play really well for two weeks on the clay and that's what you need at the French Open."" Mac regret . Other tennis legends have also come between a rock and a hard place on the unforgiving clay -- none more so than John McEnroe, who has often expressed his regret at not adding the French Open title to his seven other slams. In 1984 he was on a 43-game winning streak and having reached the final was slicing and dicing Lendl in clinical style in the French title match. Two sets up in under an hour, a disputed line call disrupted his concentration and Lendl eventually wrapped up a five-set win. McEnroe's American arch rival Jimmy Connors was also stuck one short of the grand slam sweep by virtue of failing to win the French Open. And Arthur Ashe, who famously upset Connors to win the 1975 Wimbledon crown, was another to fall short on a surface he found difficult. It seems some greats are destined never to taste the warm glow of success in Paris and current world No.1 Novak Djokovic just needs a French title to complete his career grand slam. Djokovic's goal . ""The King of Clay"" Nadal denied him in last year's final and also prevented the Serbian taking his place in the record books this year with a five-set victory in Friday's semifinals. Federer claimed his sole French crown in 2009 after Nadal lost his only match in eight years in Paris in the fourth round to Robin Soderling, and the Swiss maestro will be grateful he seized his opportunity to complete his grand slam set. Collins, now 83, believes Australian great Ken Rosewall is the greatest player he has seen on clay at the French Open. ""I'm a guy who goes overboard for Rosewall but realize (Bjorn) Borg and Nadal would be tough to beat."" Rosewall, however, is also in the group of legends who ended stuck one short of a career grand slam. In his case he never won Wimbledon, despite reaching the final four times -- the last as a 39-year-old veteran, but losing to Connors in 1974.","Grand slam in tennis consists of Wimbledon, French, U.S. and Australian Opens .

"(CNN) -- A 32-year-old man from Twin Falls, Idaho, has been charged with solicitation of rape and burglary after posting an advertisement on Craigslist seeking a man to enter his home and rape his wife, according to a Twin Falls County Court affidavit. The husband admitted to having sent e-mails to Michael Combs asking that he rape his wife, according to the arrest warrant. The ad was posted in the ""Casual Encounters"" section of the website and was headlined simply, ""Want to help me,"" Twin Falls Police Officer Justin Dimond said in the warrant. Combs told police that he responded to the person who posted the ad, who said his wife ""wanted to be forcibly raped as that was a fantasy of hers"" and urged him ""not to stop no matter how much she resisted,"" according to the arrest warrant. Police responded Saturday to a distress call from the house; when they arrived, they found the woman holding Combs at gunpoint and arrested him, according to the warrant. She had been in the house alone while her husband was returning from Mountain Home, about 85 miles away, where he works for the National Guard, she told police. Saturday's incident marked the second time in two days that police were called to the house. On Friday, the woman had struggled with another man who, she told police, told her that he was ""there for her,"" according to the arrest warrant. That man fled after pulling the gun out of the woman's hand, the warrant says. After the second incident, police examined the husband's cell phone and discovered e-mails, nude photos of the body of a woman and photographs of a man's penis that matched photographs in Combs' e-mail, the warrant says. The man who fled has not been identified and remains at large, police said. The husband was being held on $100,000 bond, with a preliminary hearing scheduled for this month; he had not yet been assigned a public defender, police said. CNN was unable to reach Combs or either the husband and wife. CNN is not identifying the couple out of concern for the wife's safety. More from CNN Justice: .

"(CNN) -- This year, maybe you think you got everything you ever wanted for Christmas (so long as everything you ever wanted was socks and underwear). But you're wrong. You didn't get everything you ever wanted. Because there's one thing you probably didn't even know existed until right now. Thus you didn't get it. Of course, I'm talking about a life-size lobster case for your iPhone. Of course. The Lobster Mobile Telephone Case is another completely unnecessary electronics accessory that recently started trending online because, clearly, we love our technology, but, at the same time, simply can't leave well enough alone. So we get freaky. ""Excuse me, sir, do you sell leather bondage cuffs for Kindles?"" OK, some of us get freakier than others. Don't judge. You see, these days it isn't enough to just bask in the original design beauty of your device. Never mind that entire teams of smart, creative individuals got together and made a sleek, shiny phone into one of the sexiest things on the planet. Your job, as a consumer, is to cover it with something lumpy. My friend Carini's head, for example. But you have to accessorize. For safety. It's about protecting your investment, and, really, if you're going to do that, you might as well give it some personality. Enter the lobster. Or maybe not. You see, the lobster case wasn't actually designed to be functional. Quite the opposite, in fact. This thing is art. The creator of the lobster case is an Australian named Elliot Gorham who, with his design company Noddy Boffin, specializes in contemporary furniture and lighting. How this particular product fits into his business model I don't know, but I think we're all better people because of it. Then again, I say that about everything. ""Did you hear Jim has syphilis?"" ""Well, we're all better people because of it."" ""Not Jim."" Regardless, Gorham says of his art, ""The phone case is a commentary on both the curious nature of the mobile phone case industry and of the modern dependency and/or addiction to mobile technology."" To be fair, I liked it better when it was just a lobster case. But all right, I can accept that there's more to it. I get art. I'm cultured. I've been known to wear pants occasionally. But what Gorham wants us to take away is that we need to detach from our mobile technology. So the lobster is meant to be very user-unfriendly as a personal deterrent, resulting, as he says, in ""minimal enjoyment of function, zero fashion credibility and lastly, reduced mobility to the user."" Clearly, however, it seems Gorham is unfamiliar with the great American hipster, for it is those very reasons that make the lobster case desirable. Though even if you aren't of the hipster species, it's still a pretty cool-looking phone accessory. For about an hour. That's when you realize that you have a lobster in your pants. But an hour is more than enough time to feel special. Which is sort of the point. To this, Gorham notes, ""Like most mobile phone cases, it does offer the illusion of individualism."" His creation was actually inspired by arguably one of the weirdest (and most brilliant) people ever, Salvador Dali, who, in 1936, designed a fully functioning Lobster Telephone. Not merely just an iPhone case. Though that would've been impressive. ""I promise in seventy years this will be relevant."" At the time, Dali called his creation of a painted plaster lobster attached to the receiver the Aphrodisiac Telephone, presumably just to mess with people. Because, generally speaking, crustaceans don't inspire lust. At least to most people. For me, it's sort of ""a thing."" Anyway, whether or not you would walk around with Gorham's modern version of Dali's lobster phone is a moot point. According to Mashable, right now it's only a design concept and not currently on the market. So you're stuck with whatever stupid, boring case you bought at the Apple store. And, really, we're all better people because of it. But not Jim. He still has syphilis.","""Apparently This Matters"" is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at items trending online .

"(CNN) -- When a marriage ends up in court it usually means the end -- but for Todd Rogers it was just the beginning. For an Olympic gold medalist and a former world champion, looking for the perfect partner on the beach volleyball court is what life is all about. The 39-year-old was a single man following the breakdown of his seven-year partnership with Phil Dalhausser -- a relationship which had catapulted both men to the very top. Now he's bouncing back after offering his own version of marriage guidance. ""The only way I can equate it to your average fan is that it's actually similar to a marriage,"" Rogers told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""The top teams literally get together, they call each other 'Hey, would you like to play?' and that's kind of like the first date. ""You ask them on a first date. Then you're meeting and going down to the beach and practicing and every one of those is like a date and a second date and third date. ""When you get to nine or 10 dates, then you say, 'OK, looks pretty good. I like what I'm seeing.' ""Then you move forward and the season comes along near the summer and every time you go out there you have the stuff that you would literally have in a marriage."" Baseball beginnings . Rogers was a volleyball divorcee when he met current partner Ryan Doherty -- a man 11 years his junior and without any real experience at the top level. His successful partnership with Dalhausser had come to its natural end but a new adventure was waiting just around the corner in the shape of Doherty. At seven feet tall, Doherty is not far off the height of the net, which stands at eight feet, giving him a major weapon over his rivals. For Doherty, volleyball has given him another chance of a sporting career after his original dreams of playing major league baseball ended in failure. A minor league player for a team affiliated with the Arizona Diamondbacks organization for three years, Doherty had hoped to become a professional only to be released from his contract. Struggling for work and suffering under the collapse of his baseball career, Doherty traveled to North Carolina to visit a friend, who would go on to introduce him to beach volleyball. ""He was living really close to the beach and we found a beach volleyball court and decided 'Oh, we should try this, we should try to learn' and I just fell in love,"" he said. ""I played every day and I got beat by high school girls when I was like 25-years-old and it was really embarrassing but still it was a great time and I loved it. ""So after I finished my degree I decided to move out to California and see if I could play this game every day."" New dream . It proved an inspired decision as Doherty went from strength to strength before pairing up with Rogers -- a move which he believes has given him another crack at becoming a top sportsmen. ""I would consider myself one of the luckiest guys you can imagine being able to play one sport professionally, two is pretty jaw dropping for me,"" Doherty added. ""I really lucked out. I don't know what I did in a previous life but I want to thank that guy. Playing professional baseball was my dream. It was my whole life. ""I wanted to do that and when it was over I was really depressed. I was really bummed because I loved that lifestyle. ""Then I was lucky enough to just fall into a lifestyle that's every bit as fun, challenging and motivating as being a professional baseball player."" So when Rogers and Dalhausser parted ways at the end of 2012 following a seven year partnership, Doherty saw his chance. It was Rogers who got in contact with Doherty after seeing a raw and talented player impress while competing alongside fellow professional Casey Patterson. Professional partnership . Rogers had already faced Patterson and Doherty on two occasions and once his relationship with Dalhausser looked set to end, the experienced Olympian made the call. ""Playing with Todd has been pretty much a dream come true for me,"" said Doherty. ""I watched every match he's played online well before I was a professional when I first found the sport. One of the most motivating things I've ever seen was Todd and his former partner winning the gold medal in the 2008 Olympics. ""It was amazing to me. I was rooting and cheering and screaming at my TV and I also know that the nickname 'Professor' is very well deserved. ""He has a really good understanding of how things work and why they happen the way they do, so just as a new guy who's trying to learn and trying to get better at the sport, I couldn't have lucked into anything better. ""This has been a really great experience for me so far."" Rogers is also enjoying his new ""marriage"" and even jokes about Doherty being his ""wife."" But while the two like to jest off the court, on it, they remain very much focused with Rogers determined to help his partner become one of the most exciting talents on the circuit. ""Ryan's very tall, he's very raw in the game but he has a tremendous amount of potential,"" said Rogers. ""But really the number one thing to me is that he's a good guy that I enjoy hanging out with and chatting with. ""You're on the court for 10 to 15 hours a week with someone but you're hanging out with them for 100 hours, maybe even more if you consider sleeping in the same room the whole time. If you're not getting along off the court I think it's real tough."" Olympic glory . While the prospect of the pair competing at Rio in 2016 is a slim one, Rogers is not giving up on making it to Brazil just yet. He remains supremely fit and agile and with Doherty at his side, anything is possible. ""The highlight was winning the Olympic gold medal in Beijing,"" he said. ""I don't think you can get any better than that although there are some other ones that are high on my list like winning in my home town for the first time in Santa Barbara, California. ""Then there was winning the World Championships in Switzerland in 2007 but the Olympics is once every four years. ""There's only been five Olympics for beach volleyball and to be part of that elite group which can claim a victory at it, the greatest sporting event in the world really, is a really cool honor for me. ""Ryan is only 29 so I definitely would hope that he's be going to Rio, if I'm his partner and it works out that way -- great. ""Right now I tend to think more of a year at a time and if Rio happens for me great, but if nothing else I can watch Ryan playing in Rio and hopefully in 2020 as well.""","Todd Rogers and Ryan Doherty are U.S. beach volleyball stars .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama began his second term with a ""keeping it real"" moment courtesy of youngest daughter Sasha. ""You didn't mess up,"" she told the president after the oath was administered by Chief Justice John Roberts in the White House Blue Room. It all went off without a hitch compared to four years ago when a redo was required after flubs during the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol raised doubts about its legitimacy. With a sense of relief on Sunday the president declared, ""I did it."" Obama's address: Full text . But over the next several months, those words will be much more difficult as the president pushes Congress to embrace his priorities, from gun control to immigration reform to raising the debt ceiling. ""We've had a pendulum of instability, arguing, fighting,"" said CNN contributor and Republican strategist Ana Navarro. Compromise was Washington's needle in a haystack, discovered often in the 11th hour. But now there's a tinge of optimism as the president gets to work in his second and final term. ""I think we'll see it (pendulum) come back to the middle sooner rather than later,"" Navarro said. A tale of two terms: Obama's unfinished business and battles ahead . Gun control . The first big test is shaping up to be an issue that never came up on the campaign trail and wasn't even on Washington's radar. Gun violence came into sharp focus after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings that took the lives of 20 children and six adults. It sparked a heated debate and led to new measures the president plans to put in place through executive action or with congressional approval. Steps quickly assembled aimed at curbing gun violence, such as universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazine clips of more than 10 rounds. Four other priorities for Obama's next four years . ""It's common sense"" said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has been pushing for stricter gun laws. 'It makes sense. It's not a radical notion."" But the National Rifle Association and other gun groups are ready for a fight, swinging with searing TV ads and a public rebuke of the administration's efforts. While polls indicate the majority of American's support the president's efforts, some political observers have doubts about Washington's ability to produce any meaningful change. ""No one Democrat or Republican wants to deal with that issue. It's not popular,"" said CNN contributor and conservative activist Erick Erickson. ""They want to just do something for the sake of symbolism."" Obama in select company . Debt ceiling . The new term will also feature some old fights. The debt ceiling round two was shaping up to be another fierce fiscal showdown. House Republicans had insisted on spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. President Obama warned he was not going to negotiate. With the prospect of a default and the Treasury Department taking steps to bridge the gap, Congressional Republicans backed off a bit, with plans to vote next week on a three-month deal to extend the debt ceiling. It's not a long-term solution, but it takes some air out of a contentious battle the president would have faced immediately. ""I understand the games the Republicans are playing, but the game the American people want them to play is play fair,"" said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Donna Brazile, who argued the rich should pay their fair share and struggling Americans should not be ""disproportionately hurt"" by deep cuts. Gergen: Obama 2.0 -- tougher, wiser? Immigration reform . One large and important constituency will be watching the president's second term closely. They care about gun violence and fiscal matters but want to see quick action on immigration reform. Hispanics, who voted overwhelming for Obama, 71%-27% over Republican challenger Mitt Romney, had hoped for more progress in the president's first term. Amid record deportations, USA Today columnist Raul Reyes says there was a lot of anxiety in the Latino community. ""It really seemed like he had forgotten about his promise on immigration."" Biden on Obama at start of second term: 'In simpatico' The White House points to steps the president did take, like an executive order to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants who entered the country as children. That wasn't enough and the president admitted as much in his post-election news conference when he vowed again to deliver on his promise. ""I'm very confident that we can get immigration reform done,"" the president said as he drew an outline of what that would look like: Stronger border security, penalties for companies hiring undocumented workers and a pathway to legal status for otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants. Some key Republicans have signaled a willingness to tackle this issue. ""I found a commitment among many of the important Republicans, the leadership, many of the rank-and-file, who want something on immigration, Navarro said. ""There have been a lot of things happening behind the scenes."" Photos: Obama's face all over the place . Other key issues . The spotlight shines less brightly on environmental concerns, climate change and energy policies, but activists and others are working to keep these issues from being ignored in the second term. In his inaugural address the president is not expected to detail policy initiatives. Top advisers say he will touch on broad themes and put meat on the bones during his State of the Union address next month. The president will work to define his legacy in the second term and plans to aggressively engage the public to put pressure on Congress. His campaign grassroots organization is back in action as a nonprofit group to further his objectives. ""We'll all work to help transform Washington from the outside"" Jon Carson, the new executive director of Organizing for Action, wrote to supporters in an email. But reality lurks in the wings as many Republicans are still skeptical. ""The president seems so fixated on demonizing Republicans that he is blinded to the opportunities as well as the obligations that he has to deal with big problems in this country,"" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Obama's inauguration: In the crowd .","After four years of partisan fighting and instability, will pendulum swing to the middle?
Obama had full agenda before school shootings inserted gun control onto plate .
Fiscal issues will be early test whether optimism of second term persists .
Activists hope environmental issues and energy policies aren't pushed aside ."
"(CNN) -- When Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis made headlines for a filibuster opposing an abortion bill, it was more than her speech that generated buzz. Davis donned hot pink running shoes as she attempted a 13-hour stand against a Texas bill that includes a provision to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. As Davis went on, her filibuster became a trending topic on Twitter and the shoe an iconic visual behind the hashtag #standwithwendy. Davis' footwear joins a long line of apparel that has become symbolic of resistance, from the Trayvon Martin hoodie to Pussy Riot's balaclava face masks. The shoes were designed for comfort, but Davis told CNN's AC360, ""I underestimated how difficult it would be both physically and mentally. About two hours in, I realized I was in for a long day."" Davis also said she didn't expect her shoes to catch national attention. Mizuno, the makers of the now-famous sneakers, told CNN they were surprised at the sudden hype surrounding the shoe, called the Wave Rider. ""The Wave Rider is designed to give the comfort and cushioning needed whether it's a 5K, a marathon or 10+ hour filibuster,"" Mizuno spokeswoman Harper Cornell said in a statement. Cornell wouldn't share sales data for the $115 shoe, but the resulting attention has increased traffic to MizunoRunning.com and the Wave Rider 16 product page, she said. Daily website traffic totals nearly doubled compared to the same day last week. The shoes have garnered rave reviews on online retailer Amazon.com, too. ""We do appreciate Ms. Davis' choice in athletic footwear,"" the company's statement said. ""However, we do not maintain a corporate position related to the topic in discussion.""

"(CNN) -- A leading tennis player believes he has been ""treated like a criminal"" after being hit with an 18-month ban for flouting doping regulations and plans to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. World No. 53 Viktor Troicki was suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Thursday after being found guilty of failing to provide a blood sample in a drugs test during April's Monte Carlo Masters. But Serbian Troicki has rejected the charge, alleging the doctor conducting the blood test allowed him to miss the procedure and says he will now appeal the decision. ""The doctor in charge of the testing told me that I looked very pale and ill and that I could skip the test if I wrote an explanation letter to the ITF about it,"" he said in a statement. ""She dictated the letter to me and let me go without giving blood. She was very helpful and understanding. ""Now I'm being charged for refusing to undergo a blood test without justification. This is a real nightmare. ""I put my trust in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, I really hope they will look for the truth and find it."" The 27-year-old Troicki confirmed that he underwent a test the following day by the same doping control officer with the result coming back negative. He also revealed that he had never previously missed a test and had undergone several blood and urine examinations during his career. But the ITF has taken a different stance on the story, insisting that the doping control officer had told Troicki that ""she could not advise him as to whether his reason for not providing a blood sample was valid, and that no such assurances were given by her."" ""I feel like I'm being treated like a criminal,"" added Troicki as he contemplated the 18-month ban. ""I have a fear of the needle and I always have trouble drawing blood. But I always did. I am clean and will always be clean throughout my career. ""I just had the wrong doctor, who didn't tell me at all that I was risking anything. She showed me a letter of the ITF saying she is in charge of the decisions and I trusted her completely. ""I wish I had recorded the discussion, there would never have been a case if I had. ""This enormous sanction makes me speechless. It feels like the world that I help building day-by-day has let me down. It is the worst feeling you can imagine."" Troicki reached a career high of 12 in 2011 and has won $4.5 million in prize money during his career. He is the third tennis player to be hit with a ban for drug violations in 2013. In May, Brazil's Fernando Romboli was handed an eight-and-a half-month ban after testing positive for diuretics, furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide. In February, Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic was banned for six months after testing positive for sibutramine, a substance which is often found in weight-loss products. In March, the ITF confirmed it would introduce biological passports to tackle drug cheats. Each player will have an individual electronic biological profile and be tested more regularly to monitor their levels and alert the authorities to possible drug use. The scheme was welcomed by the world's top players with Roger Federer telling CNN that it was ""naive"" to think tennis was free of players who use drugs to enhance their performance. But Troicki believes he was simply misled and insists he has no problem with the current drug regulations. ""The doping rules are strict and they must remain strict. But this was a clear mistake from the on-site doping control officer who was also a doctor and the person in charge to decide,"" added the Serbian. ""She let me go and reassured me. In my opinion, once she found out that she didn't follow procedures she turned her back on me. ""I am destroyed and exhausted. The whole period I have been thinking about this issue and it's not over, so I can't really describe it. ""I am not even angry with the doctor. I believe that maybe she was told her organization that she made a big mistake letting me go. She backed up and tried to save her job. ""I am a fighter and I will try to fight together with my team and my lawyers but I am quite destroyed now. I hope this nightmare will come to a good end. I really want to continue playing. I don't deserve this.""","Viktor Troicki hits back after being suspended for missing a drugs test .

"(CNN) -- My friend Brian Hull and I were both born 40 years ago today. Our lives overlapped for six years, from those first terrifying weeks of seventh grade through high school graduation. Then, like many of the friends you meet in those horrible, wonderful years, I never saw or talked to him again. We didn't start out as friends; we started out as nothing. He was a guy in my math class who wore nice clothes and hung out with the other cool kids at lunch. I ran in different circles and had zero interaction with him up until the day we found out we had the same birthday. That day, our math teacher, Mr. Sweitzer, had us go around the room and say our birthdays out loud to demonstrate a point about probability, that in a classroom of 30 people, there's a good chance that two of them have the same birthday. In our class, it was me and Brian. Once we discovered this connection, I turned to look at him, and he gave me a slight head nod as he raised a confident fist in the air and let out one of his characteristic low chuckles. After class, we talked briefly about where we were born and at what time of day. That day, we became birthday friends. Over time, we became friends. Brian was an easy person to like. He was a quiet and stoic leader, which on first blush could make him seem aloof or arrogant. Though he could be stingy with his words and often spoke in a low, monotone voice that adults often interpret as deep apathy, he was articulate and witty and thoughtful about the many things in the world that interested him. On top of that, he was really smart. One day in ninth-grade Spanish class, he rebelled against Miss Kahn's selected topic of conversation and instead suggested that we discuss the ongoing battle over Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court. In Spanish. I admired how he was passionate about a wide range of things, like politics and philosophy and religion and the environment and the Grateful Dead. I admired how he never seemed to have an unsure or awkward moment. To this day, when I'm in an uncomfortable social situation, I'll wonder, ""How would Brian Hull handle this?"" I saw this quality in him tested, maybe even stretched to the limit, in our junior year. Brian and I were still in many of the same classes, but for whatever reason, he seemed less and less engaged in school. I imagine that a common refrain in the teachers' lounge when it came to Brian was that he was smart but didn't apply himself. He missed a lot of classes; I don't know why. I just assumed at the time that it was because being popular was a full-time job. From what I could piece together from movies and TV, it looked exhausting. Whatever the reason, the absences and missed assignments were taking a toll, and things came to a head in English class. I overheard the teacher tell him how serious the situation had become, and how critical the upcoming exam on ""Oedipus Rex"" would be. I knew he hadn't read the book and hadn't been in enough of the class discussions to fake it, so I offered to study with him. I had my own problems at the time, but helping him was a welcome distraction, a concrete action I could take when I felt powerless over other parts of my life. So we went over every mother-loving detail of that miserable Greek tragedy. In the movie version, this is where I would say that he aced that exam and got his act together and excelled at everything he did thereafter, and it was all because of a little help from his friend who was born on the same day. The reality is that I have no recollection of how he did on that exam or how he did in English or in any of his other classes that year, or what role I might have played in refocusing him. Still, inside the pages of my yearbook, he wrote a note thanking me for all the help. I do know that he eventually pulled things together and that we both survived high school and moved on with our lives. I don't remember the last time I saw him or the last conversation we had. But I knew he had started college and focused on his loves of both philosophy and the environment. On the night of October 22, 1995, Brian James Hull was struck and killed by a drunken driver as he and his roommate walked to a convenience store to buy charcoal. His friend was also killed. By that time, I had graduated from college and was living out-of-state. I missed the news. When I did finally hear, after the initial shock, my mind kept drifting to all the birthdays he wasn't going to have. Brian was only 22 when he died. This is the 18th birthday he's missed. I've thought about him at each one. I think about whatever is going on in my life at the time, and how trivial it all suddenly seems. I think about the man Brian would have become. By age 40, Brian Hull might have become a university professor or a successful entrepreneur or maybe an author. His argumentative streak would have made him a great lawyer. He'd probably be married, and maybe a father of kids who would quickly come to appreciate the Grateful Dead. And he would have excelled at all these things. When I think about him today, I wish I had gotten to know him better. He wrote in my yearbook junior year, ""I'll give you a call over the summer, and maybe we can go play a championship-like tennis match at a court within close proximity. Have a thoroughly stimulating summer, and I hope to see you over it."" We never played tennis, and we never saw each other over that summer. Life has a way of intervening. Earlier this month, I visited Brian's final resting place for the first time to pay my respects in person. It's a very strange feeling to see your date of birth written on a headstone. It gives you a sense of your own mortality. It makes you think about the life you have and how you are living it. When I think about him today, I wonder who the other Brians in my life are right now -- am I squandering any opportunities to play tennis with them or see them over the summer? And because of Brian, I try to make an effort to do something about it, albeit sometimes with more gusto than others. All these years since our friendship began in Mr. Sweitzer's class, I thank him for that lesson.","CNN's Robert Yoon shared a birthday with his schoolmate Brian Hull .

"(CNN) -- It reads like something out of a Japanese monster movie: Enormous angry hornets invade cities, dive-bomb unsuspecting civilians, and inflict horrifically painful and in some cases fatal stings. But it's not science fiction, it's real. Every year around this time, the Asian giant hornets move into cities in China, Japan, Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula and other areas in Asia to forage for food for their young, and that's where the trouble starts. More than 40 people have died so far this season from the powerful stings and scores have been hospitalized. Emergency response teams are on the hunt for the nests to destroy them before the insects do more damage, and authorities have set up medical units to treat the injured. So what do the hornets have against city dwellers? Nothing, really. The hornets just happen to be in an unusually desperate situationn -- largely due to humans. The revulsion and panic that people feel when they read about these incidents or see pictures on TV and on the Internet should be about something more than fear. It should provide a moment to consider the impact of humans on their environment--one that can end up biting them back. Asian giant hornets don't eat much solid food as adults; instead, they forage for food for their young, often stealing the larvae of honeybees or other insects, but sometimes they forage for scraps of fish in city garbage cans. Then they fly incredible distances to deliver the food, arriving exhausted and starving. They get their only nutrition from their children. That's right: The babies feed the parents. These grub-like hornet larvae enjoy the meal their parents have brought them, then the parents tap on their heads, which prompts the larvae to offer up a few drops of clear liquid. The amino acids and other nutrients in this liquid fuels the adult hornets, and they fly off in search of more food. Sounds aggravating, doesn't it? I'd be angry, too, if I had to go to that much effort to feed my young. At one time, the hornets could forage through forests and fields to find a meal for the kids. But now, as those wild areas are paved over, the hornets find themselves on our turf. Their search for food is as desperate and fast-paced as it ever was, only now they must contend with parking lots and apartment buildings where they once only had to battle other insect foes. This is not the first time that we humans have moved into wild areas and found ourselves doing battle with wild creatures as a result. One example: In the 19th century, great swaths of Brazilian wilderness were hacked down to make room for plantations. Once people started living in areas that had been wild, they found themselves exposed to new diseases that had never before posed much of a threat to humans. The assassin bug, a bloodsucking insect native to the region, helps transmit a disease called Chagas disease. It had never before been widespread among humans; its reach was primarily confined to other jungle-dwelling animals. But once people moved into the insect's habitat, the disease began to spread among us and continues to do so. The deaths inflicted by the Asian giant hornet threat are indeed tragic. But they also serve as a reminder that nature is fierce and powerful. The hornets are not invasive; in this case, it is the humans who are invasive. There can be consequences to moving in on another creature's territory. The Asian giant hornet is feeling the pressure that species all over the world are experiencing. The only difference is that the hornet has found a way to push back. Can you blame it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy Stewart.","Amy Stewart: Asian hornets have killed, injured many in Asian cities .

"(CNN) -- For those that love the luxury of first class air travel but loathe the imposition of having to share it with others, Emirates thinks it has the aircraft for you. The Dubai-based airline is aiming for the high-end business traveler with a new luxury private jet service. Launched this week, Emirates Executive is a bijou and bespoke version of its premium product in a dedicated Airbus A319. It can be chartered by individuals, groups or corporations through the website. Qatar Airways and Korean Air are two commercial airlines that offer a similar executive jet chartering service. ""We have seen an increasing demand in the private travel segment, especially in the Middle East and Europe as well as in markets such as India, Russia and China,"" said Adnan Kazim, Emirates' Divisional Senior Vice President for Planning, Aeropolitical & Industry Affairs. ""We are looking to tap into this niche market with the high quality of service and attention to detail."" The Emirates Executive Airbus A319 can accommodate 19 people, with the plane divided into two main zones. The front of the aircraft has a dining area and executive lounge designed to seat 12 people. Mechanically activated tables can be raised in front of two large sofas, while one of 1,500 channels of in-flight entertainment can be watched on two 42-inch LCD screens. The rear of the aircraft has ten private suites -- similar to the ones found in Emirates' First Class cabins. Live TV, video conferencing facilities and high speed internet and mobile phone connectivity are also available on board. Passengers with an appetite can have specially prepared meals served on board by Emirates crew, while a full-height shower with heated floor is available for those who need refreshment after all that exhausting pampering. Google Street View explores the Airbus A380 . While the world's super-rich may still be able afford their own private aircrafts, the chartering of executive jets is a growing market. It's certainly a more affordable option than buying a large private jet outright; an Airbus ACJ318 (similar to the Emirates Executive A319) or long-range Gulfstream G650 costs around $65 million from the respective manufacturers. While it took a big hit after the global recession that began in 2008, the private jet market is on the rise. According to forecasts by Canadian private jet manufacturer Bombardier, the industry is expected to exceed pre-2008 levels for the delivery of new jets by next year. Read more: Private jets come within reach of business travelers . North America, with around 40% of the market, remains the biggest destination for private executive travel but the largest growth is expected to come from emerging regions in Latin American and Asia. Although hampered by lack of airspace and facilities, in the coming years China is expected to see a 15% increase in number of private jets flying in its skies, according to Bombardier. The sector is worth $626 billion to manufactures like Embraer, Bombardier and Gulfstream. Boeing and Airbus produce executive iterations of their planes, including the 747 and A380. David Velupillai, marketing director of executive and private aviation for Airbus says that their jets -- from A318s to superjumbo A380s -- can be fitted out according to their clients' needs. ""We can do features which the Chinese market particularly appreciates, such as a large round table which is the focus of Asian life. We can do Karaoke bars,"" he said.

"London (CNN) -- The British hospital where a nurse apparently committed suicide after being duped by a hoax call over Prince William's pregnant wife condemned the radio station responsible in a strongly worded letter on Saturday. Two DJs from Australian radio station 2Day FM, impersonating Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, called the hospital Tuesday and gained information about the condition of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge -- which they subsequently played on air. On Friday, the nurse who transferred the call through to the ward, Jacintha Saldanha, was found dead. ""King Edward VII's Hospital cares for sick people, and it was extremely foolish of your presenters even to consider trying to lie their way through to one of our patients, let alone actually make the call,"" wrote hospital chairman Lord Glenarthur. Management's decision then to broadcast the recorded call ""was truly appalling,"" said Lord Glenarthur in the letter addressed to Max Moore-Wilton, chairman of Southern Cross Austereo, which owns the radio station. ""The immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill-considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients. ""The longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is, frankly, tragic beyond words."" Lord Glenarthur called on the radio station to take steps ""to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated."" The fallout from Saldanha's death has stretched from Britain to Australia -- with questions being raised about how far is too far in the effort to find out details about Catherine's pregnancy. The two Australian DJs behind the practical joke, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, have come under fire, with some using the phrase ""blood on your hands"" to condemn their actions on the Sydney-based radio station. ""Pranksters Face World Fury,"" screamed the front-page of the UK's Daily Mirror on Saturday, while Daily Telegraph columnist Bryony Gordon said it was ""not so funny to hear two grown adults call up a hospital ward full of sick people to try to scam information about one of them."" Read more: Nurse's death casts glare on 'shock jocks' The DJs have since apologized, and ""mutually decided"" to go off the air for an undetermined period, Rhys Holleran, CEO of the Southern Cross Austereo media group, said Saturday during a news conference. But he defended the legality of the station's action, saying he was ""very confident that we haven't done anything illegal."" ""This is a tragic event that could not have been reasonably foreseen, and we are deeply saddened by it,"" he said. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, the country's media regulator, has not yet commented on the case. However, it will be ""engaging with the licensee, Today FM Sydney, around the facts and issues surrounding the prank call,"" said the regulator's chairman, Chris Chapman. News of Saldanha's death broke Friday, with the hospital saying she ""was recently the victim of a hoax call."" London's Metropolitan Police said that Saldanha, 46, had living quarters in central London provided by her workplace. Police said they were notified Friday morning that a woman was found unconscious at the address. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Police are treating the death as ""unexplained."" A post-mortem examination will be held next week, police said. A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said Saturday that he ""thinks this is a very sad case and his thoughts are with her family and colleagues."" Throughout the controversy surrounding the hoax, authorities did not identify the nurse. Her identity was released after her death. Audio of the call posted online suggests a woman spoke briefly to the DJs before she put the call through early Tuesday morning to the ward where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness. ""They were the world's worst accents ever. We were sure 100 people at least before us would've tried the same thing. ... We were expecting to be hung up on. We didn't even know what to say when we got through,"" Greig told listeners Thursday. Off the air, Greig and Christian tweeted about the practical joke on Thursday and earlier Friday, promising ""more on the #royalprank."" The pair's Twitter accounts were taken down late Friday. Some listeners applauded the prank, like one who identified himself as Guido on the station's Facebook page and wrote, ""It is only a joke people! it was great i love it!!!"" Others were outraged, with such negative comments outnumbering positive ones on 2DayFM's Facebook page before the nurse's death. ""Your stunt was done at a time in this country where there is paranoia about the intrusion of the media into people's lives,"" Gary Slenders wrote. ""I know you will say it is harmless fun, the management of 2DayFM will say that it won't happen again, but this is exactly where the phone hacking scandal started."" The outcry grew exponentially after the hospital confirmed Saldanha's death, leading the Coles supermarket chain to remove all its advertising from 2DayFM. ""This death is on your conscience,"" reads one Facebook post. Several accused the two of having ""blood on your hands."" Saldanha's family released a statement asking for privacy and directing questions to police. She is survived by her husband and two children. ""We as a family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved Jacintha,"" said the statement, released by police. Saldanha worked at the King Edward VII Hospital for more than four years, and she was described as an ""excellent nurse,"" well-respected by coworkers, the hospital statement said. The hospital ""had been supporting her throughout this difficult time,"" it said. A St. James's Palace spokesman said: ""The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are deeply saddened to learn of the death. ""Their Royal Highnesses were looked after so wonderfully well at all times by everybody at King Edward VII Hospital, and their thoughts and prayers are with Jacintha Saldanha's family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time."" Separately, a palace spokesman told CNN: ""At no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident. On the contrary, we offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses involved and hospital staff at all times."" The hospital said Wednesday that it deeply regretted the call had been put through. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro, Max Foster, Per Nyberg, Chelsea J. Carter and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","Hospital chairman slams ""truly appalling"" decision to air the prank call on 2Day FM .

"(CNN) -- I was late to work one recent morning. I was out getting married. Maria, my partner of 12 years, was losing her health benefits. We needed to add her to my family plan by June 1 and it was already May 31. We have a 7-year-old daughter. You don't mess with this stuff. So we left our child at elementary school, grabbed two Mamas at drop-off to serve as witnesses, and hopped a cab to City Hall. The Mama crew produced white-frosted cupcakes to mark the occasion. I worried about making it to work. Maria looked like she was there to get a tooth extracted. It's hard to get jazzed about this stuff when you are rushing to only getting half married. I call it half married because, in our situation, the only benefit this New York state marriage brought us was the right to put her on my company insurance plan, a benefit that would be taxed as income by the federal government because they don't recognize same-sex marriages. If my employer didn't offer to offset the tax, a rare benefit in U.S. companies, I'd actually be signing up for something more expensive than I could buy on the open market. That's not the only limitation with a state marriage, which brought us benefits we'd already acquired through legal documents. There are 1,138 federal benefits to marriage you don't get as a gay couple who are married in New York, like SSI, Medicaid, inheritance rights, veterans' benefits and rights as joint parents. We could jam wedding cake down each other's throats at a big party, just like the others, but cupcakes at the justice of the peace seemed fine for this. Same-sex spouses entitled to federal benefits . The truth is we got out of the marriage debate ages ago. This was only paperwork affirming what we already knew. We declared ourselves self-married back in 2001 during a romantic trip to Healdsburg, California. I engaged in drop-to-your-knee romanticism at our spa hotel, produced a diamond ring and made all sorts of fresh-love promises. We were the only ones we told back then, and that felt like enough. Ten years earlier, as a journalist, I had covered the 1991 case of gay couples in Hawaii who sued for the right to marry. Opponents would successfully persuade 38 state legislatures and the federal government to bar recognition of same-sex marriages out of concern that they would be made legal. I'd watched this fight firsthand and wanted no part of it. We had made our private commitment in the absence of legal benefits and divorced ourselves from the ongoing public fight. I was a journalist who wanted to see every side of this debate, not become a part of it. In 1999, I traveled to Montpelier, Vermont, when that state came close to allowing even a limited state-sanctioned marriage between two people of the same gender. A state legislator showed me a stack of old legal papers. ""This is what 'married' means in Vermont,"" he said, adding they would replace the word with ""civil union"" to satisfy a state court ruling that the Vermont constitution guaranteed equal treatment for gays. A simple search-and-replace of wording would allow Vermont to create separate but equal institutions. Other states followed suit, including New York, which allowed domestic partnerships. So Maria and I went and got one of those in 2002, for no other reason than giving our union the paperwork needed for all sorts of things. We didn't need a cake or party then, either, but a notary public at Chase Manhattan Bank jumped up and hugged us both when he saw what he was certifying. Then we dispassionately dropped off the papers at a window that the city clerk had created next to the dog license registry. Opinion: For gays, progress stunning, fast . The next year -- exactly 10 years ago today -- the U.S. Supreme Court, in deciding Lawrence v. Texas, ruled that it was legal for two people of the same gender to have sex, essentially legalizing being gay. Justice Antonin Scalia said in his dissent, ""Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned,"" Scalia wrote. ""If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is 'no legitimate state interest' for purposes of proscribing that conduct ... what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples..?"" That seemed very far away. Around that time, gay people began seizing every opportunity to get sort-of married. They traveled to Canada and rushed to appear before activist justices of the peace in Oregon, upstate New York and San Francisco. I interviewed people who got married over and over again, before judges would shut everything down and make them unmarried. These didn't feel like weddings to me; they felt like news stories, protest weddings that came without the gift of benefits. They meant something to the people exchanging rings, but I felt no more or less legally married than they were, so it was easy to remain objective about what these things meant. Then something extraordinary happened. Massachusetts courts ruled gays had a constitutional right to marry and, on May 17, 2004, I watched the first ever same-sex couples legally wed in the United States. Our friends got annoyed when we said we weren't rushing up to Massachusetts to get married. We hadn't called ourselves ""married"" years earlier to make a point. We had made a commitment. Rushing off to get married in Massachusetts, when we lived in New York, felt like activism. I was far from that when it came to this issue. By that fall I was pregnant with Luna and suddenly there was a need for all sorts of legal paperwork. Absent the right to marry in New York, we spent thousands obtaining health care proxies, wills and creating joint ownership of our apartment. When she was born we told her we were married. ""Mamas!"" she would shout and urge us to both kiss her cheeks at once and affirm her family trio. ""I have two Mamas."" But her two Mamas were not both legally her parents. We spent another $10,000 on a second-parent adoption to make us both her legal parents, even though we had no legal relationship to each other. I've filed taxes each year as a single parent, which actually made my tax situation better. There were definitely good and bad benefits associated to the right to marry. Opinion: Fight for gay rights must continue . Then our own state recognized same-sex marriages and suddenly the social pressure was on us to get ""gay married."" A dozen states allow gays to marry, but this was the one we live in. At the time, it seemed to us that we got no practical benefit from a state marriage given all the paperwork we had completed. We'd already made our commitment and had the acceptance and love of our friends and families. Our employers recognized our relationships and our child was safe. Facebook lit up with emotional appeals to get to the altar, but we were simply not in a marrying way. I felt like this was still a story for me to tell, not live. The only struggle we had was how to explain this debate to Luna, who believed her parents were already married. Did she need us to get ""married"" yet again? For our anniversary we went to see a play called . ""Standing on Ceremony,"" in which Richard Thomas plays a guy named Joe eulogizing his dead partner. Joe asks if they should get married and the dying man asks what that would mean about the last 45 years of their lives together. I asked myself the same question. If Maria and I suddenly got a state marriage, would we find ourselves celebrating our first anniversary a year later, as if we didn't already have a 7-year-old child, a home we'd owned for 10 years, a relationship we'd built over 12 years? What finally brought us to the city clerk's office was the requirement that our marriage be sanctioned by the state of New York for me to add Maria to my family health insurance -- call it a modern shotgun wedding. The marriage bureau staff ushered us into a room where cases displayed old marriage records of turn-of-the-century brides and grooms. We stood at an altar in work attire while the Mamas readied their iPhones for pictures. We took off the rings we'd worn for the last 12 years. The justice of the peace read traditional vows in a booming voice, then directed us to put our rings back on each other. The whole thing went down in about two minutes, and Maria inexplicably began to cry, which made me cry. There were pictures of us jamming the Mamas' cupcakes down each other's throats. Then we all rushed off to work. This morning we had warned Luna at breakfast that the U.S. Supreme Court was deciding today whether ""gay"" people can be legally married. ""You're lesbians,"" she declared, checking to see if that word, ""gay,"" included us too. Then she began listing all the people she knows who would be affected, starting with the children. I dropped her off for her last day of school and she said: ""Love you, Mama"" and I got a kiss. An hour later, the U.S. Supreme Court married us all over again -- a decision that changed everything, and nothing at all.

"London (CNN) -- When Andy Murray won the Brisbane International, a warmup event for January's Australian Open, few were surprised. But what followed was largely out of character for a man who is perceived as one of the more dour characters in the world of sport. After winning the final, Murray turned towards the television cameras and showed a side of himself that had so rarely been seen. ""I'd like to dedicate this victory to one of my best friends,"" the British tennis star told the crowd. ""He's back home watching and you're going to get through."" Thousands of miles away in London, Murray's former roommate Ross Hutchins sat facing the prospect of six months of grueling chemotherapy after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma -- a cancer of the lymph node immune system. Friends since their early years and former doubles partners, the two were inseparable on and off the court, with both taking time to tease one another about their receding hairlines. But not even Hutchins, who has seen a side of Murray that few others have caught a glimpse of, expected such a gesture. ""I didn't expect the speech, that's for sure,"" the Englishman told CNN's Open Court. ""I just expected him to, well I was hoping he would win the title ... we had been very close that week as we always are. ""So I was watching the speech and was thinking how pleased I was he had won, and then he came and dedicated his trophy, which meant the world to me. ""It's something which lifted me up and it meant a lot because it was a big stage leading into a grand slam. ""My fiancee cried and she doesn't cry that much. It was a very special moment for us, it was something we shared together and it was something we'll never forget."" It was a rare moment of emotion from Murray, who has often been derided for his downbeat personality. The tears which followed his defeat by Roger Federer in last year's Wimbledon final finally allowed the public a glimpse of what lay behind a perceived deadpan exterior. His victory on the same court at the London Olympics was then followed by his first grand slam triumph at the U.S. Open last September -- a day that Hutchins will never forget. Having been two sets ahead of world No.1 Novak Djokovic in the final at Flushing Meadows, Murray allowed his rival to fight back and move level before triumphing in a pulsating final set. ""He was so determined to win that match, I don't think we can ever appreciate what was going through his head,"" said Hutchins. ""Everyone in the world that had watched him over the last final finals was thinking, 'Oh it's going to happen again.' ""But he wouldn't let it and it was a joy to watch. It was an incredible moment when he picked up the trophy."" A friend in need . While Murray had triumphed and defeated his demons, Hutchins was just beginning his own personal battle that same month. Searing back pains prevented him from sleeping for more than two hours, and left him in absolute agony. So severe was his sleep deprivation that Hutchins tried everything from laying out on the wooden floor in his bathroom, to sleeping on a foam roller covered with tennis balls. It was only after speaking to a coach at a training camp in La Manga, Spain, that Hutchins began to realize the severity of the situation. After initial tests showed pneumonia in his left lung, Hutchins sought further medical advice about an enlarged lymph node in his chest, which turned out to be cancerous. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer of the white blood cell found in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. Its most common symptom is a painless swelling in a lymph node, normally in the neck, armpit or groin. The day his diagnosis was confirmed -- December 27, 2012 -- is etched into Hutchins' memory. ""I called Andy and spoke to him about it,"" said Hutchins, who got engaged to his longtime girlfriend Lindsay Wood in February. ""Andy was saying, 'You're going to be better after this, you're going to be stronger, you're going to be a far tougher person and tennis player.' ""Obviously my fiancee was upset. I'd actually warned her that it was going to be this. ""She was amazing, she'd been through cancer in her family with one of her parents so she knew what it was all about, so she was like a rock for me. ""I love her to bits and I can't thank her enough. She was great and she was supportive, but that was initially a tough moment."" Support . Hutchins has been overwhelmed with messages of support from well wishers from across the world since he announced his condition at the end of last year. Far from being a household name in the world of tennis, the 28-year-old, who grew up a stone's throw away from Wimbledon, can barely believe the public's reaction. ""It's something that I can't really express in words,"" said Hutchins. ""I've still got all the letters and all the cards in my living room and they mean so much to me. ""People who have taken time from three-year-old kids who have written or drawn pictures to me, to people who have done montages, it's been incredible. A lot of them will remain in my heart forever, because it's something you don't expect."" Murray, in particular, has been a rock for Hutchins -- showing a more sensitive side than their usual joking banter. ""We don't normally have too many serious conversations,"" he added. ""I've needed a different side of Andy but we're closer than ever."" Recovery . Hutchins completed his chemotherapy sessions last week and was courtside as Murray won the Aegon Championships at Queen's Club on Sunday. The two appeared on court, after the world No. 2's final win over Marin Cilic, at the Rally Against Cancer charity match alongside Tim Henman, Murray's coach Ivan Lendl, Tomas Berdych and a host of celebrities. Murray donated his $115,000 winner's prize to the charity, which supports the Royal Marsden hospital where Hutchins was treated. ""Ross has handled it all so well,"" Murray told CNN in his typical understated manner. ""He has a great family and he's been so positive. Hopefully he'll go for his scan and it will all be OK."" Hutchins will be tested in mid-July to see if the cancer has been defeated, while a final verdict will come in late September or October following another scan. Best man . After that, there is the small matter of his wedding at the end of November, at which Murray will be best man. Murray is taking charge of planning the bachelor party along with Hutchins' brother -- a task he was expecting, according to his close friend. ""I think Andy kind of knew it was coming,"" said Hutchins. ""When I got engaged I think he knew it was going to be him and then I said to him, 'You know it would mean a lot to me,' knowing how supportive he has been over the years. ""He kind of jumped to it, he was like 'Great, it means a lot to me, let's do it and let me know if you need me for anything else.' ""And he probably says that a lot at the moment and I am using him a lot."" 'Superstar' Hutchins believes his friend has all the attributes to become ""a great champion"" as he begins his bid next week to become Britain's first Wimbledon men's winner since Fred Perry in 1936. ""You dream about being able to time the ball that sweetly and to have the precision that he has,"" says Hutchins. ""Mentally he's so strong, he's able to rise to occasions and serve aces on break points, he's able to capitalize when he senses his opponent is struggling with a certain tactic. ""He is a superstar, he's a master tactician, and he's as feisty and competitive as they come.""","Ross Hutchins gives a rare insight into the life of Andy Murray .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Police in the northern India state of Rajasthan say they were stunned when a man showed up at a police outpost holding a bloody human head in one hand and a sword in another. The head was that of the man's daughter, chopped off because of her ""indecent behavior,"" Umesh Ojha, deputy superintendent of the district police, told CNN. Investigators say the man, Oghad Singh, had paraded the head through the village on his way to the police station. Singh's daughter, Manju Kunwar, was in her 20s and was living with her parents after divorcing her husband two years ago. Her father accused her of acting indecently with other men. Family convicted in 'honor murders' Authorities say Kunwar's mother is a farmer who was working in the fields at the time and was too distraught to talk. Singh works in a marble quarry. The beheading happened on Tuesday in Dengar Ka Guda, a village in Rajsamand District about 400 kilometers, or 250 miles, from Jaipur in the state of Rajasthan. Kunwar's head and the rest of her body were cremated according to Hindu tradition, police said. India is filled with extremes on many levels, including how women are treated. In India women hold some of the highest positions in society, from company CEOs to the president and speaker of the House, but this case highlights another side of India, one in which women still suffer the consequences of long-held traditions that govern their behavior in Indian society. This month India topped the Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the worst place to be a woman among the top 19 economies in the world. The foundation cited abuse, killings and discrimination on a scale unparalleled in the other developed nations.

"Ashkelon, Israel (CNN) -- It's become a daily routine for Israelis living near Gaza: a casual conversation interrupted by an air-raid siren, then a furious rush to find cover, and finally -- if all goes well -- a flash in the sky indicating an incoming rocket has been intercepted. While Israelis are protected by the relatively new Iron Dome missile interceptor system, it hasn't abated the fear that one of the dozens of rockets fired from Hamas-controlled Gaza into Israel in recent days will strike nearby. More details on Iron Dome . Schools and businesses in southern Israel near the Palestinian territory of Gaza are closed, as Hamas militants and the Israeli military mull their next move. Just a few miles from Gaza in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon -- which has been repeatedly targeted by militants in recent days -- Effie and Andi Moradian decided to move their family into their parents' apartment building to protect their three kids from incoming rocket strikes. ""It (has) a safe room, it's got thicker walls and it's more or less blast resistant,"" explained Effie Moradian. His two daughters pass the time on their grandparents' sofa, reading books and drawing flowers and colorful butterflies. The monotony is constantly interrupted by the sound of explosions outside. Effie Moradian says it's unclear if the rocket landed or if it was intercepted. Victims in Gaza too young to understand . Either way, the fear is the same. ""It's really frightening especially when we're in school and hear a 'boom' and there's bombing,"" said 11-year-old Shiraz Moradian. Wedged between a crowded bookcase and the metal door to the apartment's small safe room is pile of cushions and blankets heaped on the floor. That's where all three children will sleep for the foreseeable future. The Moradians, like many other Israeli families, are taking no chances that their family will be protected by the Iron Dome -- which has shot down approximately half of the nearly 600 rockets that have struck Israel since the conflict began Wednesday. ""We can't go on like this,"" said Ashkelon Mayor Benny Vaknin, who drives the streets of his city checking on residents. ""We have 131,000 people here and 26,000 children. They are constantly under threat."" Rafel Moshe, who was playing backgammon at a pizza place downtown, echoed the mayor's thoughts. ""They don't want peace,"" said Moshe, speaking of the people in Gaza. ""How would you feel if your children were constantly scared?"" The city's residents have experience dealing with how to quickly move to air raid shelters and some, like Moshe, have a ""Red Alert"" app for their smart phones that tracks rocket attacks. Israel and Hamas: How the conflict reignited . ""We don't want war but there are people all the time shooting at Israel and we are quiet -- we stay quiet -- and the world doesn't see the truth,"" Moshe said. And it's not just in southern Israel where nerves are frayed. In Jersualem -- some 50 miles away from Gaza -- sirens went off on a calm Friday evening, startling James Cheatham who sent video to iReport. Cheatham said people ran for safety -- most apartments in Jerusalem are equipped with bomb shelters -- and later, the distant sound of a rocket exploding could be heard. ""You feel very vulnerable and you're really not sure where to go, because you don't know where they will land,"" he told CNN. ""I'm a Christian, so we do a lot of praying."" In Israel's second most populous city, Tel Aviv, life was relatively normal last week as explosions could be heard from the current conflict. ""Tel Aviv is quite in a routine mode. There's no panic, but the streets are half empty,"" explained Shachar Laudon, who submitted photos to iReport. ""Many are in their homes. There is tension over the city and many are confused. ""Many still don't know what to do in case of an attack."" Frederik Pleitgen reported from Ashkelon and Tricia Escobedo from Atlanta.","Israel-Gaza conflict has created widespread fear across the Jewish state .

"(CNN) -- Red Bull, whose Formula One team has won the drivers' and constructors' titles for the past three years, could have a home race in Austria from 2014. Red Bull founder Dietrich Mateschitz and F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone have struck a deal to return the race to the sport's global calendar after an 11-year absence. A statement from Red Bull's headquarters in Austria said: ""Dietrich Mateschitz and Bernie Ecclestone have reached an agreement which will see Formula 1 return to Styria [a state in south-east Austria] as early as next year. ""The race [is] to be staged at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg. ""Pending all of the necessary official authorizations for the Red Bull Ring, the race is scheduled for July 6, 2014. We are thrilled."" The agreement and date is provisional until the sport's governing body, the FIA, ratify the calendar later this year. New circuits added to the F1 calendar also have to be pass the FIA's safety tests. The Red Bull Ring staged the Austrian Grand Prix between 1970 and 1987 in its former guise as the Osterreichring. The fast, narrow circuit was dropped from the calendar because of safety concerns before reappearing as a shortened A-Ring in 1997. Ferrari's Michael Schumacher won the last race held at the circuit in 2003 before it again lost its place on the calendar because further planned redevelopment of the track had stalled. Mateschitz bought and rebuilt the circuit, branding it the Red Bull Ring, and now his long held hope of bringing F1 back to his homeland could be about to be fulfilled.","The Austrian Grand Prix could return to the Formula One calendar in 2014 .

"(MarthaStewart.com) -- This is a collection of excerpts from ""Living the Good Long Life"" by Martha Stewart, published by Clarkson Potter. Combine travel with exercise . I love to walk. But when I discovered hiking, it took walking to a whole new level. Suddenly, I found I could combine walking with my passion for traveling. In one sense, it's just walking, but it takes me to new heights, literally. I've hiked all over Acadia National Park in Maine, near where I have my summer home, but it's fun to figure out where else in the world I want to hike. So far I've accomplished a few major hikes, such as Mount Kilimanjaro, the Inca Trail, and Northern Sikkim. They were all so fabulous and memorable. Next I'd love to do some trails in China. My favorite workout . I started lifting weights many years ago, and I've always enjoyed it. I like feeling strong -- I can literally feel the improvement after each workout, and I know that at minimum I'm increasing my strength, my bone mass, and maintaining my weight (especially when I'm making up for some delicious indulgence at dinner the night before). Martha Stewart Living: The no-sweat summer workout . Because I now have good overall strength and am usually pressed for time, Mary, my trainer, has me doing two-in-one moves that are really wonderful. For instance, I'll lie on my back on a bench, holding weights in both hands and arms open perpendicular to the bench. As I bring my hands together in a ""fly,"" I bend one knee to my chest and extend the other leg with each move. The works the chest, legs, and core in one move! Martha Stewart Living: Top tips for healthy summer skin . Take a different route every day . I almost never take the same route twice. I follow different paths through the woods or around the farm, and in the city, I wander down various streets to peek in on new restaurants or shops. I take new routes coming into the city so there's always something novel and interesting to look at -- new architecture, a field, or a reservoir I hadn't seen before. It helps the brain to always keep things interesting! And you'll never be bored. Play games socially . I am not a big social game player, but the value of knowing a fun card game or word or numbers game to play when there is downtime is very beneficial. I like cards but have really never had a lot of that ""downtime"" to engage in poker or bridge or even canasta. I recently learned an easy card game called Gozo that can be played by up to five people, and uses two decks of cards. It is a lot of fun and very engaging. I do promise, however, to really learn both poker and bridge, and I also promise to one day have some of that elusive downtime we all dream about. Martha Stewart Living: 13 crazy beauty tricks that really work . Meeting my mother's friends . When my mother died, I was astonished by how many people came to her funeral. It was standing-room only in this large Catholic church in Weston, Connecticut. Honestly, I had no idea how many friends she had! I knew that she kept busy; she was always writing letters, calling to catch up, offering to drive someone to do errands or see the doctor. But I saw that she was so extremely connected to the people in her town. Talking to these friends after the service was such as lovely, moving experience. They each offered me some little reminiscence of my mom -- stories, insights, and memories. We all need to work harder on social skills -- visiting, remembering birthdays, taking trips together -- with both friends and family. Martha Stewart Living: 11 secrets for a happy and healthy summer . Create a bucket list . Keep a list of things you want to do or feel you must do during your lifetime -- and then checking them off before you kick the bucket -- is a really good thing. That's why movies like ""The Bucket List"" resonate with so many of us. It certainly resonated with me. While on a photo shoot in Palm Springs, California, it was important to me to visit Joshua Tree National Park. Known for its incredible rock formations and its extraordinary vegetative wonders, it had long been on my ""bucket list."" It was well worth the early 4 a.m. departure and the long drive into the desert. It is one of those places I will never forget. Martha Stewart Living: 10 ultra firming face masks . Just move on . There are any number of incredibly challenging things that I have to deal with every day -- I get mixed news on a financial report, or I have to make a speech in front of hundreds of people. So I long ago developed the ability to deal with stress: you just have to solve one problem immediately and, if you have to let off some steam. A good way to do this is by going for a quick walk. And then, perhaps most important, you move on. You don't ruminate or worry, but keep moving forward. Life is a pile of problems that have to be solved one way or another, and the best way is to look at each one individually, figure it out, and move on. Treat your feet well . I never wear the same shoes two days in a row. Rather, I rotate through high heels, medium heels, low heels, and flats. Also, I do not confine my feet. I never wear shoes at home, and when I'm riding in the car, my feet are bare so I can wiggle my toes and give my feet some air. I also walk barefoot on gravel all the time. I like to walk on all different kinds of surfaces, particularly when I hike. Practicing walking on uneven surfaces (safely!) is good for foot health, because it strengthens the ankles and improves balance. Martha Stewart Living: 9 color boosting and nourishing hair care treatments . Be proactive . Living well is not a passive act. It is imperative to be engaged in taking care of ourselves. In addition to exercising and maintaining a varied and nutritious diet, one of the most important things I do for myself is to make sure I consult the right professionals at the right times. I try my best to schedule my routine doctor visits and age-appropriate medical tests for the entire year all at once, using the advice of my primary-care physician (very important to have one). That way, nothing gets forgotten and everything will be done when it should be. Get those appointments on you calendar now if you haven't already -- and see how good it feels to take charge of your health.","Martha Stewart shares her secrets for living well and living long .

"(CNN) -- More than 100,000 Syrians fled the country in August, by far the most of any previous month in the civil war, the United Nations said Tuesday. Here are the latest key developments in the 18-month crisis: . Diplomacy: . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, speaking in New York at a meeting of the General Assembly, described the humanitarian situation sparked by the crisis in Syria as ""grave and deteriorating."" He said the conflict ""has taken a particularly brutal turn"" and accused both sides of committing human rights violations. ""Government forces and the armed opposition have clearly failed to protect civilians and respect the rules of international humanitarian law. We must ensure that anyone, on any side, who violates international humanitarian law or human rights law is held to account,"" Ban said. The secretary-general appealed to all parties, including countries in the region, to do what they can to bring an end to the conflict. ""Those who provide arms to either side are only contributing to further misery -- and the risk of unintended consequences as the fighting intensifies and spreads,"" he said. The new United Nations and Arab League envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, also spoke, stressing that the future of Syria will be built by its own people. ""The death toll is staggering, the destruction is reaching catastrophic proportions and the suffering of the people is immense,"" said Brahimi, who was appointed after previous envoy Kofi Annan stepped down. Brahimi is planning to go to Damascus soon, after a stop in Cairo to consult with the Arab League. In Cairo on Tuesday, protesters and police clashed outside the Syrian embassy. Police fired tear gas at activists who had wanted to remove the flag and replace it with a Syrian rebel one. At least seven police and eight protesters were injured, according to a spokesman at the interior ministry. Big spike in refugee numbers: . More than 103,400 Syrians fled to neighboring countries in August, bringing the total to more than 235,300 refugees who are registered or awaiting registration, the U.N. refugee agency said. Syria's entire population is about 22.5 million, according to the CIA World Factbook. The number of refugees is more than 1% of the population. Humanitarian crisis: . Inside the war-torn country, the head of the Red Cross is negotiating with Syrian officials this week for better access to civilians tormented by the bloody civil war. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, met Tuesday with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an agency spokeswoman said. Maurer planned to meet with other officials Tuesday and Wednesday and might give a briefing on his talks later this week, spokeswoman Cecilia Goin said. The flow of aid has hardly kept up with the pace of violence in Syria, with scores or hundreds of people reportedly killed each day. Medics resort to makeshift clinics and crude supplies to treat the wounded, sometimes without electricity. The ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent have provided almost 180,000 Syrians with food and other essentials since mid-July. But some of the most desperate civilians remain trapped in relentless violence. ""In those places where fighting is taking place, it's very hard to access those people in need,"" Goin said. ""The humanitarian situation is deteriorating fast."" A sniper's bullet, a dying child, a family's desperation . Last month, U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos offered a grim account of the civil war's toll on the masses: more than a million uprooted; a million more in need of urgent aid. Amos said she is ""extremely concerned that all parties of the conflict are failing to comply with international humanitarian law, which sets out clear rules on the protection of civilians."" Al-Assad's regime has said it will let aid groups already in the country expand their operations but won't allow new aid to enter. The government is worried the aid would get into the hands of ""armed groups and terrorists,"" a phrase it uses to describe those seeking al-Assad's ouster. But Tuesday, state-run news agency SANA reported that al-Assad ""said Syria welcomes humanitarian operations carried out by the International Committee of the Red Cross on the Syrian ground as long as it works independently and neutrally."" The SANA report said Maurer ""expressed appreciation over the Syrian government's cooperation with the committee, hailing the bridge of confidence built between the two sides."" Goin, the ICRC spokeswoman, said her group has previously asked for a cease-fire to deliver aid. But bloodshed across the country has only intensified since. ""The national authorities and the armed opposition groups, they must respect and help facilitate"" access by aid workers, Goin said. ""The only goal of the organization is humanitarian."" On the ground: . At least 155 people were killed Tuesday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The deaths included at least three women and four children. Eighty people were killed in the Damascus area, the group said. Ten corpses were found ""after being field-executed and seven of them were identified."" Other deaths were reported in Aleppo, Daraa, Hama, Homs, Lattakia, Idlib, and Deir Ezzor, the LCC said. Syria, on state-run media, said authorities released 14 kidnapped people, and pursued and killed ""terrorists."" Throughout the conflict, the Syrian government has blamed ""terrorists"" for the violence. A bomb in a taxi exploded Monday, ""martyring five citizens and injuring 23 others,"" the state-run news agency SANA reported. The incident took place in the Damascus suburb Jaramana. Also Monday, the families of 40 ""martyrs"" were honored in Lattakia, SANA reported. Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said Monday that ""what is happening in Syria is a massive conspiracy and an aggression using barbaric tools whose elements are obvious,"" SANA said. CNN's Dana Ford, Josh Levs, Holly Yan, Esprit Smith, Joe Sterling and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 155 people were killed Tuesday, an opposition group says .

"(CNN) -- The happiest day in Justin Smith's life -- next to the day his daughter was born -- was March 5, 2013. When his phone rang, he looked down and saw the 301 area code. It must be the National Institutes of Health, he thought. He didn't know anyone else in Maryland. Indeed, Dr. Brigitte Widemann was calling to say that after five months of waiting, Smith's 12-year-old daughter McKenna had been accepted into a clinical trial at NIH headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland. She could begin the week of September 30. Smith thanked the doctor and hung up the phone. ""Baby, hopefully we can get you a cure now,"" he said as he hugged and kissed his daughter. McKenna has neurofibromatosis, a rare genetic disorder. Countless tumors in various parts of her body tangle around her nerves and grow into her soft tissue. One tumor the size of a grapefruit crushed her esophagus and her carotid artery when she was 4 years old. Another tumor collapsed a lobe of her right lung. The growths are starting to cut off sensation to her right arm and left leg; soon she will lose function of them entirely. She's on four different pain medications, including two types of morphine. McKenna has had two surgeries and 24 rounds of radiation. The tumors have continued to grow. She underwent medical experiments to use the drugs thalidomide and Gleevac. Both were a failure. Doctors have told Smith his daughter will likely die before her 20th birthday. She turns 13 today. ""This NIH trial is her last hope,"" Smith said. The Smiths boarded a plane Monday from their home in Cape Coral, Florida, to head to Bethesda. But during the trip -- even as they checked in at the Children's Inn at NIH -- they weren't feeling hopeful that McKenna would be able to start taking the experimental drug, called hydrogen sulfate, on Friday as scheduled. Hydrogen sulfate, or AZD6244, has been tested in adults and children with cancer. NIH doctors think it might be able to prevent benign tumors like McKenna's from growing, or at least shrink the tumors and slow down their growth. Smith feared the government shutdown would keep McKenna from being able to start the study at all. McKenna is one of about 200 new patients, including some 30 children, who come every week to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to begin clinical trials. These patients are being told they will have to wait until the government starts up again to start their trials, according to NIH spokesman John Burklow. Taking care of McKenna, as well as her disabled grandmother, is a full-time job for Smith, a single father. An Army veteran, he's used to hard work and trying times, but as he waited Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for word from the doctors, he grew more and more worried -- and angry. On Wednesday he tweeted, ""#governmentshutdown needs 2 end #Now hurting sick people. have the #House come here to apologize to my young daughter & others."" ""Finally we're here and our government can't get its act together,"" he told CNN. Then at 3 p.m. Wednesday, there was a turnaround. For reasons that are unclear, McKenna's doctors said she would be able to start taking the hydrogen sulfate on Friday as scheduled. No one knows how many other new patients like McKenna also managed to get into their NIH studies despite the government shutdown. ""If a child or adult patient is in desperate need for treatment, those people will be handled in a different manner,"" Burklow said, ""and will more than likely be seen by physicians or nurses at the NIH Clinical Center."" While relieved that his daughter can start the trial, Smith worries about the kids who won't be able to. There are the other patients, like McKenna, who were supposed to start this week at the NIH Clinical Center, and if the shutdown continues, another 200 patients every week will face the same dilemma. Even though McKenna's been lucky, the shutdown has still made her trip more difficult. With 75% of NIH's employees on furlough, the testing takes much longer than it should. An eye doctor's appointment this week, for example, should have taken one hour, but lasted more than three. Exhausted and in pain, McKenna had to take a dose of morphine to get through it. And then another setback, this one unrelated to the shutdown: doctors found a new tumor in McKenna's eye. This medical complication means she might not be able to get the drug Friday as planned. Smith said he knows what he would do if he could talk to members of Congress in person. ""I'd put my daughter in their face and I'd say, 'Why are you putting politics above my daughter's life, or any other child's life?'"" he said. ""This is not a game."" McKenna said her message to Congress would be much shorter. ""This is stupid."" CNN's John Bonifield and Val Willingham contributed to this piece.","Some 200 new patients, including 30 children, start a clinical trial at NIH every week .

"New York (CNN) -- Handcuffed to a bed and wrapped in a hospital blanket, a New York nanny accused of killing a sister and her toddler brother pleaded not guilty Wednesday to murder. In a case that has given many parents nightmares, Yoselyn Ortega was watching 6-year-old Lucia and 2-year-old Leo Krim at their Upper Westside Manhattan home in late October when police say she stabbed the kids to death. Their mother came home, police said, and found her children in the bathroom. She also saw the nanny stab herself with a kitchen knife, authorities said. ""This crime shocked and horrified parents around the city, many of whom entrust their children to the care of others both by necessity and by choice,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance said in a statement. ""My heart goes out to the family of those beautiful young children, and I hope that, with time, this family will heal."" Wednesday's hearing took place -- not in a courtroom -- but at Manhattan's Weill Cornell Medical Center. Ortega, 50, did not speak, and her lawyer entered her plea for her. The nanny is expected to undergo psychological evaluation, said authorities. She has been indicted and charged with first- and second-degree murder in both deaths. A native of the Dominican Republic, Ortega had been a naturalized U.S. citizen for 10 years.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants opened fire at a military ceremony in the capital Sunday morning. A lawmaker, tribal leader and 10-year-old child were killed, but President Hamid Karzai escaped unhurt, according to an official and a statement from Karzai's office. Afghan soldiers run to take up positions after shots were fired during a parade in Kabul on Sunday. The attack also wounded more than 12 people, including a member of parliament, a Health Ministry official said. The attack occurred at a Mujahedeen Victory Day ceremony, observing the 16th anniversary of Afghanistan mujahedeen fighters' overthrow of President Mohammad Najibullah's Soviet-backed regime. Small arms fire erupted as a military band played the Afghan national anthem and as soldiers fired a 21-gun salute with artillery rounds. The people standing did not react for several seconds, but security guards shielded Karzai and whisked him away from the reviewing stand. Other dignitaries quickly scrambled to safety.  Watch military, crowd react to attack » . Karzai appeared on state-run television fewer than two hours later and called on citizens to remain calm. The Health Ministry official said lawmaker Fazel Rahman Samkanai died from injuries sustained in the attack. A presidential statement said Nasir Ahmad Latifi, a council head of the Qezelbashan ethnic group, and a 10-year-old child were killed. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mojahed issued a statement, claiming responsibility. ""Six of our Fedayeen martyrs entered to the stadium for the ceremony. They were heavily armed with mortars and machine guns. This was an organized attack. When the national anthem started they started the attack. Three were killed and three have survived,"" the statement said. The Taliban also claimed its fighters got within 30 yards of the stand where Karzai and other dignitaries were standing. A diplomatic source said a mortar round landed near the stand. Defense Ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi said the attackers were captured, but he did not say how many were in custody. U.S. Ambassador William Wood and British Ambassador Sherard Cowper-Coles were in the stand, but were unhurt and later returned safely to their offices, spokesmen at their embassies said. Uniformed U.S. military personnel also were in the stands and were not injured, U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Stroh said. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also condemned the attack. ""This attack against the legitimate institutions of the Afghan state and the Afghan people is unacceptable,"" Ban said in a statement. Afghanistan's state-run television station, which carried the ceremony live, captured the scene on camera. As the fusillade became more intense, people turned to one another, some sat down and a few fell to the ground. Soon, people were scrambling from their seats while a stream of Afghan soldiers ran by, away from the sound of gunfire. The live broadcast was interrupted about two minutes after the attack began.

"(CNN) -- Sara lives in Sierra Leone and just wants to go to school. She left her village and her family to live with an aunt who is a teacher. Sara's aunt supported her education and helped her study. Sara is now attending secondary school near her village and wants to go to college. She says she is going to be a lawyer. ""I want to be a superstar of Sierra Leone,"" Sara says. Sara is the exception among girls in Sierra Leone. During the country's decade-long civil war, many schools were destroyed. Families were often forced from their villages and now live in poverty. If they have the money to pay school fees, many girls still miss out on an education simply because a family usually will choose to send a boy to school before a girl. Girls are often forced to marry at an early age, exposing them to early pregnancy and even HIV. Gender-based violence and genital cutting are also major problems in Sierra Leone. The nonprofit Plan International USA  is one group working with girls in Sierra Leone and other West African countries. Sara is one of hundreds of girls who have taken part in the organization's Girls Making Media Project. Teenage girls in some of the poorest areas of Sierra Leone learn how to write, produce and broadcast radio programs -- empowering them to speak up for themselves and raise awareness of the issues they think are most important.

"(CNN) -- Spending 24 hours in Le Mans is not for the faint-hearted. The legendary French motor race is for the fearless, the global players, the 24-hour party people. It's a feat of endurance for drivers, engineers, car manufacturers, media and fans alike. But, if you can muster the strength, the rewards are great; the experience exhilarating. In the equivalent of 16 Formula One races completed back to back, the professional drivers take on treacherous night conditions and the risk of an accident with one of the amateur entries -- one ex-Formula One star ended last weekend's race in hospital after a spectacular spill. But the racing is only half of the story. Car corporations spend millions showcasing innovative technology, while off the track fans parade in all manner of costumes. On Sunday Audi continued its recent dominance of an event that dates back to 1923, as German driver Andre Lotterer took the checkered flag for the second successive year . The La Sarthe circuit in the heart of the French countryside is a Mecca for motorsport fans, and the race provides a unique challenge for competitors that ranks alongside F1's Monaco Grand Prix and the United States' Indianapolis 500 as the sport's blue riband events. Asked to sum up what makes Le Mans so special, the reliably succinct television commentator Martin Brundle resorted to reeling off a list. ""The track, the ambiance, the crowd, the titanic challenge of the phases of the race, you versus the track, you versus the elements, 30 scheduled pit-stops..."" began the 53-year-old, an ex-F1 driver and a winner at Le Mans in 1990. He finished 15th overall on Sunday in his first Le Mans race since 2001, competing alongside his son Alex on Father's Day. ""It's just an incredibly complex challenge. We do the equivalent of 16 F1 races in a day if we get to the end of the race -- that's how tough it is,"" Brundle said. The drivers of the 35 cars that finished last weekend's race certainly earned a rest -- and a shoulder-rub or two -- in the days that follow Le Mans. Each car had a rotating three-man team of drivers assigned blocks of 45-minute slots behind the wheel, although it was normal for them to stay out on track, pushing on for more than two hours. For many, the biggest challenge is ""the graveyard shift"" when the sun sinks, leaving unblinking headlights and the neon streaks of passing cars to guide the drivers round pitch-black corners. ""At night it feels like a video game,"" said former F1 driver Karun Chandhok, after becoming the first Indian to race at Le Mans. ""It's so surreal because you're through the forest and all you've got are the headlights, the LED dashboard and lights coming towards you."" Driving through the night is just one hazardous allure of Le Mans. The race is also fraught with potential dangers because it invites four classes of cars of variable speeds as well as professional and amateur drivers to compete together. Britain's Anthony Davidson, another former F1 driver, is recovering after breaking his back when his front-running Toyota was tipped upside-down and into the air in a collision with a Ferrari sportscar driven by a 52-year-old amateur. Davidson, who cheerily tweeted he was ""happy to be alive,"" knows, just like any racer, that rewards in this sport come with the caveat of great risk. The potential rewards for car manufacturers at Le Mans are no less significant. Audi's entries put on an ultimate show of strength for their brand, powering to all three overall podium places and the manufacturer's 11th Le Mans win in 12 years. But rumors in the Le Mans paddock suggested the German car company spends at least $125 million a year on research and development alone for its Le Mans on-track project. The American Starworks Motorsport team won the junior LMP2 category, while the Italian Ferrari AF Corse team won the professional race for sportscars. Race organizers, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, also encourage car manufacturers to invest in testing and showcasing new technologies -- especially those with relevance to future road cars -- during the race weekend. Audi made history by winning the classic race in a diesel-hybrid car for the first time. A hybrid car uses two types of technology for energy; Audi also adopted an electric flywheel system devised by the Williams F1 team to help power the car. Toyota, whose two cars were unfortunate non-finishers, had returned to Le Mans for the first time in 13 years to showcase the Japanese firm's petrol-electric hybrid technology. But the car that set pulses racing was the sleek, black American-built Nissan DeltaWing, cherished because it dared to be different -- and because of its resemblance to ""the Batmobile."" Highlighting ""downsized technology,"" the car -- invited to race as a guest entry -- was half the weight of a typical Le Mans prototype and designed to consume half the usual fuel and tires. The demise of the DeltaWing, after it was cruelly thumped into the barriers by a Toyota in the first half of the race, seemed only to further fan the flames of fervor. Race organizers plan to invite a hydrogen-fueled prototype to take part in 2013. While the asphalt hummed with this year's race cars, the service roads thronged with shuttles and golf buggies chauffeuring corporate guests to hospitality, helicopters and product launches in a 24-hour marketing assault. ""Motor shows are irrelevant for fans, we need to get to our customers and be close to the fans on and off the track at events like this,"" said the general manager of Nissan Europe, Darren Cox. With 55 assorted cars starting the race -- from Audi juggernauts to the racy Corvettes and Porsches -- there was plenty to quench the 250,000 car-thirsty fans who flocked to France. There will also be plenty of pilgrims returning with less fragrant memories of a few days spent in a French field. Memories perhaps of men dressed as Pamela Anderson, complete with lifeguards, swaying mounds of glass beer bottles, $18 pizzas, a motorized wheelbarrow with a perilous pace and the whiff of rubber from an improvised burnout drag strip along the service roads. Le Mans is a brilliant event to ""endure"" with relish -- but perhaps it's a relief that it comes but once a year.","Le Mans 24-hour race is an endurance test for fans, as well as drivers .

"(CNN) -- Delta Air Lines is reviewing surveillance video from an incident last week in which a 9-year-old boy boarded a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas, apparently alone and without a ticket, a spokeswoman for the airline said Monday. While spokeswoman Leslie Scott applauded the crew of Flight 1651 for their ""vigilance"" after they alerted authorities to the boy, she sought to reassure travelers that the airline is going through the video as it reviews ""our policies and procedures to make sure something like this does not happen again."" As of Monday, the boy was still in Las Vegas, where his status will be discussed in court Tuesday, a spokesman for Minnesota's Hennepin County said. Officials in Hennepin County are waiting until ""things are resolved out there"" before proceeding with the case, Chuck Laszewski said. The child's parents are said to be cooperating fully, CNN affiliate KARE reported. The boy went through security with other passengers, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement Sunday, but officials are still trying to figure out how he did it -- and how he then got on the flight Thursday. Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, said the crew ""became suspicious of the child's circumstances"" during the flight. Crew members got in touch with authorities in Las Vegas and turned the boy over to Child Protective Services, Hogan said in a statement. A longtime flight attendant told KARE that children who are traveling alone normally get special attention. ""It's a big responsibility for the airline as well as the flight attendant,"" Gregg Proteaux, a longtime flight attendant, told KARE. ""You're responsible for them. How do you let 110 people on board when you only have 109 boarding passes?"" The boy spent a good amount of time at the airport before boarding the plane, KARE reported. He was there the day before, the station reported, citing airport officials. He passed his time by taking luggage from a carousel, bringing it to an airport restaurant. CNN affiliate WCCO reported he ordered chicken fingers and a soda, then left without paying, asking a server to watch the bag while he went to the restroom. The following morning the child took a light-rail train to the airport, cleared security and made it to Las Vegas nearly without detection. A flight security expert said the incident highlights the gaps in security, especially when it comes to children. ""That 9-year-old child does not need identification,"" Terry Trippler of ThePlaneRules.com said, pointing to the TSA's policy that only adults age 18 and over are required to have a state-issued or U.S. federal photo ID. The incident is a first for the Minneapolis airport, according to Hogan. Over the years other airports have had similar incidents. In 2007, another 9-year-old managed to fly from Seattle to Phoenix to San Antonio before being found out. However, he had a boarding pass. His mother told CNN her son gave ticketing agents a fake name. Last year an 11-year-old boy in Manchester, England, managed to slip away from his mother during a shopping trip. He made it all the way to Rome without a boarding pass or a passport. But any Colosseum dreams were dashed. He never left the airport in Rome and was returned to his parents the same day. CNN's Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.","NEW: CNN affiliate reports parents are cooperating with authorities .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- The Pakistani Taliban -- under pressure in fighting with the military -- said Tuesday it wants to return to a peace deal that recently collapsed. The fighting in the Swat Valley region has forced thousands of civilians to abandon their homes. That collapse sparked the ongoing massive military operation, a Taliban spokesman said Tuesday. Taliban militants in Swat Valley have announced that they are willing to disarm if the Pakistani government allows sharia, or Islamic law, to be implemented in the region, a spokesman for Taliban mediator Sufi Mohammed said. The government rejected the offer, saying the Taliban must pull out of Swat or face arrest, state information minister Syed Sumsam Ali Shah Bukhari said Tuesday. According to Bukhari, the offer shows that the Taliban's morale is down and they are retreating. The lastest round of fighting has killed an estimated 1,100 Taliban militants and 75 Pakistani security personnel, Pakistan's military said Tuesday. Another 226 Pakistani security personnel have been wounded, the military said.  Watch journalists tour of the Swat Valley battlefront » . Mohammed negotiated the previous deal between the Taliban and the government, which called for the same arrangement. That deal fell apart because the Taliban refused to disarm and moved into the Buner district, located outside of the region that the government allowed them to control. The government has said it will only allow sharia if it does not contradict Pakistan's constitution. There are many interpretations of Islamic law, but the Taliban's version has curbed human rights, forcing women indoors, men to grow beards, and shops to stop selling movies and music. The military operation against the Taliban in northwest Pakistan has resulted in the exodus of more than 2.4 million civilians since May 2. The United Nations estimates that it's the biggest movement of people in Pakistan since the country was formed in 1947. It is also believed to be the fastest population flight in the world since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.","Pakistani Taliban says it wants to return to peace deal that recently collapsed .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, August 28, 1963, hundreds of thousands of Americans marched on the National Mall in support of civil rights. From the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his iconic ""I Have a Dream"" speech, asserting the paramount importance of civil rights for all. The march forced the issue of civil rights onto the national agenda and into the lives of every American of every race. It was the culmination of years of tireless work and perseverance, all involving tremendous risk and quiet courage, much of it receiving little or no attention. Wednesday, August 28, is the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. The march was one of the proudest days in our nation's history, a day when all Americans heard what it might sound like to ""hear freedom ring."" People gathered in excitement over the potential of major progress in the centuries-long struggle for American equality. In June 1963, President John F. Kennedy had become the first American president to deem civil rights a ""moral issue,"" stating that it was an issue ""as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution,"" that America ""will not be fully free until all its citizens are free."" Kennedy, however, was assassinated before seeing the full legislative fruits of his labor. Following this inspiring March on Washington and with the strong support of President Lyndon Johnson, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, both major pieces of legislation that placed the primary responsibility and power to protect every citizen's right to vote with the federal government. Never again would the United States revert to the injustice and immorality of Jim Crow laws, poll taxes and literacy tests that defined and preserved systemic racial inequality in the South before the March on Washington. Today, the most vital provision of the Voting Rights Act, in effect, no longer exists. The preclearance provision of Section 5 requires Justice Department approval of any significant voting change in a set of nine states and parts of six others covered by a formula in Section 4 on the basis of the states' history of racial discrimination in voting. Although Attorney General Eric Holder is wisely taking Texas to court under Section 3, experts insist that the crucial remedy was the preventive one provided by Sections 4 and 5. Yet in June, the Supreme Court struck down Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder. The court argued that the problem of voter disenfranchisement on the basis of race can no longer be assumed to persist in the jurisdictions identified after extensive congressional hearings in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 2000s. Therefore, the court decided, the crucial means of oversight -- pre-clearance review -- granted to the federal government in Sections 4(b) and 5 might no longer be necessary to secure the ends -- the right of every eligible citizen to vote -- for which those provisions were enacted and frequently re-enacted. Instead, the list of covered jurisdictions would need to be updated by Congress in a continuing manner on the basis of ever-changing data. Many legal scholars across the ideological spectrum have explained why this unprecedented decision violates long-settled constitutional principles under both the Enforcement Clause of the 14th Amendment and the long-established principle and practice, established in McCulloch v. Maryland. The ""McCulloch test"" requires the court to defer to Congress regarding which means are necessary to achieve legitimate ends, so long as those means do not cross established constitutional boundaries among the branches of government or between government and individuals. I am not a legal scholar, but I argue that there is another, more basic and compelling reason rooted in legal precedent why the court was mistaken. Precedent dictates that the Supreme Court should exercise extreme restraint in extraordinary situations known as ""political questions."" In Baker v. Carr, the court outlined the factors that identified the existence of purely ""political questions."" One of those factors is ""the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government."" I do not claim that the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act is literally a ""political question"" entirely beyond the purview of the federal courts; such questions, I understand, are truly few and far between. What I do argue, however, is that many of the same factors that instruct the court to exercise restraint regarding political questions are applicable here. Namely, the court had every reason to defer to congressional expertise and political accountability when hearing this case. In Shelby County v. Holder, the court entered into the political arena, heedless of the need for caution and deference, and the resulting decision expressed a blatant lack of respect for the other branches of government and, by extension, for the American people. The Voting Rights Act is a monument to the long struggle, over more than a century, for racial equality. The act became law because of the courage and devotion of those involved in the civil rights movement and our country, and our government has, since the act's original passage, understood its significance as something more meaningful than just one more act of Congress. In fact, the act is extraordinary in that it has been consistently revisited and reaffirmed by both Democrats and Republicans since its passage almost 50 years ago. Included in the 1965 law was a clause stating that unless Congress voted to extend the Voting Rights Act, it would expire after five years. In 1970, under President Nixon, Congress renewed the act for five more years. In 1975, under President Ford, Congress again renewed it for another seven years. In 1982, under President Reagan, Congress reauthorized it for 25 years, and in 2006, under President Bush, Congress did so again for another 25 years. Each of these presidents signed renewals of the act. I will probably never be denied the right to vote. I am a white male with a valid form of identification living in a progressive state. In November, when I cast my first vote in a national election, I felt excited, proud and part of something larger than myself. I have trouble believing that I will be as excited and proud to participate in an election in which my peers won't have the same protection against voter discrimination as they did last fall. My whole life, I have heard that if one person in every precinct had voted differently or if one less supporter had made it to the polls, my grandfather would not have been elected president in 1960. Voting matters. In Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court showed a lack of respect for the efforts of all those who, both in government and out, worked over the generations to uphold America's ongoing efforts to fulfill its promise of equality under the law. The ruling effectively erased a landmark piece of legislation that secured the culmination of a century-long struggle toward justice and equality for African-Americans and minorities in America. Beyond its implications in the present, Voting Rights Act itself is a monument to all those who fought for a voice and a vote. Not since Reconstruction had our government acted so strongly in the name of civil rights. In his majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, Chief Justice John Roberts explained how successful the act has been in limiting racial disenfranchisement, which ""is no longer the problem it once was."" He conceded that ""these improvements are in large part because of the Voting Rights Act"" itself. That argument makes logical sense only if one believes that discrimination in voting in America no longer exists. But, I think most of us would agree that is not that case. The law was successful because it created an effective protection against racism by allowing the federal government to stop disenfranchisement before it became law, not after it became part of a local electoral system. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her dissenting opinion, eliminating this law is ""like throwing away your umbrella in a rain storm."" The act's effectiveness makes it an important symbol of the good that government can do. It reminds Americans that their government is capable of effective action and is committed to fostering a genuine democracy for everyone. The civil rights movement didn't end on August 6, 1965. It continued because the work of creating a truly equal country never ends. Racism plagued America throughout the '60s, into the '70s, through the '80s; it continued in the '90s and in the first decade of the new millennium; and it persists today. King's dream was not that he would be able to stop marching in a few years, once things got a little bit better. Racism and inequality may not be as severe as before, but when ""stand your ground"" laws in Florida protect those many believe to be guilty of racially motivated violence, then surely there is work to be done. And when state legislatures put new barriers in the way of voters, turning them away for not having certain forms of ID, then clearly we have yet to perfect the very process that makes America the democracy it promises to be for all of its citizens. On Wednesday, August 28, let's remember all the work that still needs to be done.

"(CNN) -- Cindy Ann Yuille was a hospice nurse and everybody's friend. Steve M. Forsyth, a father of two, loved to coach youth sports teams and had an entrepreneurial spirit. Information on the two emerged after they were killed Tuesday in a shooting at a mall in Happy Valley, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. A wounded teenager remained in serious condition. ""(Cindy) was a wonderful person who was very caring and put others first,"" the Yuille family said of the 54-year-old nurse who lived in northeast Portland. Yuille, a native of California, enjoyed hiking and cross-country skiing, loved ones told The Oregonian newspaper. She had a 23-year-old daughter and 13-year-old stepson, The Oregonian reported.

"(CNN) -- Remember when oil giant BP paid billions of dollars to clean up its own mess from the 2010 Gulf oil spill? Then the company agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and pay an unprecedented $4 billion fine for the spill. In the latest development, Wednesday, BP was essentially told to stand in the corner when it comes to winning new federal contracts -- a potentially huge blow to the company's bottom line. And it's still likely on the hook for civil penalties the federal government hopes to recover for environmental damages. So, is BP being punished enough for the deadly and destructive Deepwater Horizon spill, or too much? It depends on who you ask. This matters. BP says it supports nearly a quarter of a million American jobs and has invested $52 billion in the United States since 2007. Experts suggest punishments ranging from massive fines to banning the company from offshore drilling. However this all shakes out, it likely will send a powerful message to the industry. Families of killed rig workers react to BP settlement . First, here's what happened Wednesday: . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it will block BP from new government contracts due to its ""lack of business integrity"" stemming from the 2010 explosion and oil spill. It was a tragedy that killed 11 oil workers and dumped 205 million gallons of oil into the Gulf in a slow-moving, 85-day national drama that prosecutors called the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. This month hasn't been good to BP. The decision follows the London-based company's agreement November 15 to plead guilty to criminal charges including manslaughter, obstruction of Congress and environmental violations related to the explosion and spill -- an agreement that still requires a judge's approval. What it means . Wednesday's EPA decision means BP won't be allowed to compete for new contracts, grants or other business until the company shows it meets federal business standards. As of February, BP had $9 billion in contracts to supply the U.S. government with fuel, most of it destined for military users, said Christine Tiscareno, a London-based analyst with S&P Capital IQ. Those contracts aren't affected by the EPA decision, the agency said. BP said it's already filed paperwork to get back in good graces with the EPA, said the agency is already preparing an administrative agreement to lift the suspension and highlighted what the company says it's done to rectify the situation. ""As BP's submissions to the EPA have made clear, the company has made significant enhancements since the accident,"" the company said in a statement. ""The company launched an internal investigation immediately after the accident, publicly released the results, and has been implementing all 26 of the investigation's recommendations."" What's ahead . The next big step in the case comes in February, when a civil trial is expected to begin over the government's demand for civil damages under the Clean Water Act. That case could draw huge new fines for the company. The disaster, in addition to claiming 11 lives, caused disruption to countless residents and businesses, many of whom counted on the Gulf for their livelihoods, whether in the oil fields, fishing grounds or tourist beaches. For some, including environmentalists, the company couldn't be fined enough or spend enough money to get back on their good side. ""Well, you know, we're discussing the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history,"" said Matt Dundas, acting campaign director at the environmental group Oceana. ""The punishment needs to fit the crime."" But, he said, the record $4 billion fine BP is expected to pay as a result of the criminal case is a tenth of the maximum it could have faced, making it small consolation to BP's harshest critics. The fine, while a record for the U.S. justice system, represents less than three months worth of profits for BP. The company reported $5.2 billion in profits in the quarter that ended September 30. Dundas is now rooting for the maximum possible verdict in the civil case -- $50 billion in fines. But he says there's only one punishment that would really get BP and other oil companies to sit up and take steps to prevent what Dundas says is the overwhelming risk of another large oil spill: being kicked out of the game entirely. ""I think a terrific minimum would be to bar them from offshore drilling,"" he said. ""That's really the only standard that's going to get oil companies to pay attention."" The head of a trade association representing BP and other oil and gas operators in Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico said Wednesday that BP has already complied with government requirements. ""BP has done everything that the federal government has asked and more. ... This new EPA designation is another layer,"" said Chris John, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. ""How much is enough, when the economy in America is trying to dig out of the recession, and energy ... is a very important component to getting Americans back to work?"" The EPA's decision could have a negative impact beyond BP, he said, affecting other companies in the industry who have also complied with regulators. ""The companies that operate out in the Gulf of Mexico, they can go anywhere, they're global. They can drill anywhere in the world,"" John said. ""They have chosen to come back to the Gulf in the past few years. ... This additional statement and designation by the EPA has to play into their decision of where to put their capital."" BP didn't directly address whether it believes it has paid enough for the disaster, but noted Wednesday that it has spent $14 billion in response and cleanup costs, $1 million on restoration projects and $9 billion in compensation and expects to spend $7.8 billion more to resolve the majority of outstanding claims. Owning up . The company also pointed out it has acknowledged criminal responsibility, carried out recommendations made by investigators who studied the incident and has taken actions to strengthen safety and drilling standards that exceed federal regulations. Tiscareno, the oil analyst, said that while the costs to BP have been steep, they are bearable for the company. The big question is what happens in February, when the civil case goes to trial. Tiscareno said she expects BP, which has taken a long-term approach to recovering from the spill, will recover financially unless the civil trial nets an ""irrational"" decision. A huge verdict could pose problems for BP, Tiscareno said, but she said the government can't go too far in gutting the firm because of all the jobs and tax revenues the company provides. BP has invested $52 billion in the U.S. in the last five years, employs 23,000 U.S. residents and indirectly supports nearly 250,000 jobs, the company said Wednesday. ""The U.S. needs BP as much as BP needs the U.S.,"" Tiscareno said. CNN's Kendra Wates and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: Trade association: ""BP has done everything that the federal government has asked""

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- At least three people were killed and 174 injured during clashes in Egypt on Sunday, officials said, exactly one year after the country's first democratically elected president came to power. Protesters took the streets, demanding the resignation of President Mohamed Morsy. His supporters also rallied at what were mostly peaceful demonstrations. However, at least one person was killed in Bani Suef, south of Cairo, when fighting broke out between the two sides, said Health Ministry spokesman Yehya Moussa. Two others were killed in Asuit, he said. All three suffered gunshot wounds. Many Egyptians worried about tensions leading to a dramatic showdown. ""Egypt is on the brink of a volcano,"" government-run newspaper Al-Akhbar said. Anti-Morsy supporters divided . Anti-Morsy protesters have a wide range of views on why Morsy should go and how to eject him from office. The Tamarod, or ""rebel,"" campaign, a large movement led by opponents of the president, has spent months collecting signatures on a petition calling for Morsy to step down and call new elections. Organizers helped push for Sunday's protest. But the opposition is made up of various groups and loose coalitions, and not all anti-Morsy protesters agree with the road map the Tamarod campaign is advocating. Some anti-Morsy protesters are loyal to the ousted government of Hosni Mubarak, while others want the army to intervene and lead a transition similar to the revolt that removed Mubarak from power. Applause greeted Egyptian military helicopters that flew over Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square midday on Sunday during protests. Morsy's opponents stood their ground in the square, where protests two years ago helped topple Mubarak's 29-year rule. This time, they're hoping for the same fate for Morsy, as the chant most heard in the crowd was the word ""leave."" Ordinary citizens fed up with fuel shortages, power cuts, a collapsing economy and rising crime have also joined the protests. Opinion: Get ready for Egypt's 'second revolution' Morsy supporters rally . Morsy's supporters, however, say the president needs more time to tackle Egypt's problems. Supporters gathered at the presidential palace in Tahrir Square and in Rabaa Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo's eastern suburb of Nasr City on Sunday. A sit-in that started on Friday continued in Rabaa Al-Adawiya Square, where thousands of supporters gathered in support of Morsy. Demonstrator Rifaat Ali traveled from Upper Egypt to the capital with a message to Morsy's opponents: ""Our patience has run out. Either you back off, or the only thing left to do is attack with one fist."" The tensions weren't limited to Cairo. Protests also erupted Sunday in Suez, Sharqia, El Monofia and Gharbiya, the state-run Ahram news agency said. And in the port city of Alexandria, so many people turned out that traffic virtually came to a standstill. Fears of more violence . Before the death reported Sunday, clashes had already claimed at least eight lives, including associates of the Muslim Brotherhood whose offices came under attack. Andrew Pochter, a 21-year-old American in Alexandria to teach children English, was stabbed to death Friday while watching the demonstrations, his family said. The Kenyon College student wanted to improve his Arabic before returning to the United States. ""He cared profoundly about the Middle East,"" his family said. Pochter was planning a career in the region in hopes of advancing the peace process. An Egyptian man died from a gunshot wound to the head, the health ministry said. Muslim Brotherhood under fire . The Muslim Brotherhood, whose leaders included Morsy before his election, has lost four members to violence in recent days. On Sunday, a spokesman for the group said that its headquarters in Cairo fell under attack from between 100 and 150 ""thugs."" They threw stones and Molotov cocktails, spokesman Gihad Haddad said. Police in charge of protecting the building abandoned it, he said. Two people were shot dead Thursday when armed men attacked Muslim Brotherhood offices in Zagazig, Morsy's hometown, the spokesman said. The gunmen were shouting ""Down with Morsy"" during the assault. State media reported that protesters demanding Morsy's ouster ransacked the city's offices of his Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing. Hamdeen Sabahy, a leftist former presidential candidate, said he and others challenging the Egyptian government ""reject the violence ... and all the attacks on the (offices) of the Muslim Brotherhood or their party."" ""Peace is our weapon,"" Sabahy said in a video message posted Saturday.

Egyptian troops deployed to keep order after Brotherhood offices attacked . Economic woes . Since Morsy took office, Egypt's already sour economy has plummeted further as investors pulled out of the country, and tourism has dropped. At the same time, crime in Egypt has spiked. Some are calling for a return to the law and order they knew under Mubarak's autocratic rule, carried out with the iron hand of the military. Although Morsy gave a speech highlighting his achievements during his first year in office, opposition members said he did not address his shortcomings and called for snap presidential polls, a new government and constitutional amendments.

Last week, Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said the army would, if necessary, ""prevent Egypt from slipping into a dark tunnel of civil unrest and killing, sectarianism and the collapse of state institutions.""

"(CNN) -- Most parents have felt the pain of having a missing child, if only for a few seconds. They lose sight of their child at the park or at the grocery store or at the mall. Fortunately for most moms and dads, as soon as the knot forms in their stomach, they lock eyes with their kid. But for the parents of the hundreds of thousands of children who go missing each year, that pain is much deeper; for some, there is never relief. Working in the media, I've followed the cases that get national attention. I've watched the press conferences and the family statements. Last week, however, I had the heart-wrenching experience of finding out what happens in between the media updates -- what it feels like when this is real life. A sweet 14-year-old girl who babysat my son in the church nursery was missing. She'd left home without her parents' permission to meet up with a boy she connected with online. That was on Monday. The boy said he never went to their rendezvous point, a park, and as of Thursday, the young girl still had not come home. The days in between were grueling for those involved in the search. I cannot fathom the depth of emotion her parents experienced. Hope in the search for missing children . Police never suspected foul play and thought the girl might have run away. That scenario was both frustrating and encouraging. It was frustrating because the family did not think she intended to be gone long. She didn't bring anything with her. No phone, no keys, no money. It was encouraging because it was the best case scenario. Maybe she ""just"" ran away. Maybe she was fine -- angry, confused, and unaware of how loved she is -- but fine. The conversations that unfolded were surreal. We talked to a detective about the possibility she was involved in sex trafficking or abducted or even worse. We had to avoid focusing on the ""what ifs"" in order to stay focused on the search. When word got out, the community rallied around the missing teen and her family. We plastered the city with fliers and canvassed her last known whereabouts. People who had never met the family joined the search. Dozens of homeless people in the area helped out. As the story spread on social media, people around the world sent words of support. Those of us on the ground did everything we could think of, all while having no idea what we were doing. Three days after the girl went missing, I was helping plan a prayer vigil. We didn't know where to begin. There was no guide. We ""guessed"" the parents should speak first, before things got too emotional. But what should they say? How do we get the word out? How long should it go? We didn't know the answers to these questions. The prayer vigil never happened. About an hour before it was to begin, the young girl was located. She had run away, and she was home now. For the media, that's where the story ends. A quick update to tell local TV viewers everything is OK. Opinion: Most missing persons cases don't have happy endings . For the friends assisting with the search, there was a huge sense of relief. There were hugs, tears, and then the exhaustion and gravity of the week hit. We laughed -- about how much trouble this girl is in, about how much wine we planned to drink. After this experience, I'll never look at news of a missing child the same. I will hold this experience close the next time an e-mail about a missing child crosses my inbox. I will remember the reality behind the story. Each missing child poster represents a family in heartache and a community at a loss.","When a child goes missing, a community comes together .

"(CNN) -- The double veto cast by Russia and China at the United Nations Security Council on Saturday represents a clarifying moment in the Syrian uprisings. At the 2012 Munich Security Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton noted, ""We don't know what the endgame will be until we start the game."" Well, fasten your seatbelt -- the game over Syria has started. The Syrian conflict is no longer just about a brutal dictator repressing peaceful protesters who are demanding what every Arab desires: dignity, freedom, and an opportunity at a decent life. The Syrian revolution is now the fault line in Middle Eastern politics, through which U.S.-Russian competition, the U.S.-Iran conflict, the Iran-Saudi regional rivalry, and the Shiite-Sunni ages-old conflict will play out. The double veto has dealt a heavy blow to the political endgame outlined by the Arab League proposal: an orderly transfer of power from the president to his deputy, formation of a unity transition cabinet to oversee the writing of a new constitution, and the holding of parliamentary and presidential elections. To start with, this endgame had a minimal chance of success. Giving up power peacefully is not an Assad family tradition. Both father, the late Hafez Assad, and son, Bashar al-Assad, have shown their willingness to use any violent means at their disposal to quell internal dissent. This was the case in Hama in 1982 when Hafez Assad sent his military, including warplanes, to crush an Islamist uprising, killing an estimated 10,000 people and razing one-third of the city buildings. In Homs, Hama, Idlib, Daraa, and numerous other Syrian cities, the son is now living up to his father's murderous legacy. What the protesters and activists on the ground will take from the double veto is one lesson: Down with politics -- this is a military fight, and it is ours to win. While the international community will be there in words, it lacks the will to intervene militarily in Syria. As Clinton said, ""Military intervention has been absolutely ruled out and we have made that clear from the very beginning."" The double veto at the United Nations marks the beginning of the proxy regional game: armed opposition under the leadership of the Free Syrian Army -- funded by Arab Gulf states including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, trained by Turkey -- waging a protracted fight against the pro-regime military and paramilitary groups funded and trained by Iran and Russia. Despite recent limited success in defending restive cities and taking control of territory in places like Zabadani and Homs, the Free Syrian Army remains more a collection of disparate groups of defectors than it is an organized army. Its headquarters are in a refugee camp inside Turkey close to the Syrian border. The number of fighters is estimated to be in the range of 10,000 to 30,000. To wage an effective military campaign against an army that numbers in the hundreds of thousands, they need weapons, training and operational support. Only when the regime's military superiority is threatened will we start to see defections in its senior ranks. Iran, the Syrian regime's main sponsor and ally, will not stand idle. There are reports by Syrian opposition groups of Iranian assistance to the Syrian regime, especially in the area of building electronic and telecommunications capacity. Iran, Russia and China are the main suppliers of weapons to the al-Assad regime. While Iran's support in weapons and training will continue, and in fact increase, in the coming weeks, it would be hard to say whether Iran and/or its proxy Hezbollah will send troops to assist in the Syrian regime's military campaign. It is fair to say that Iran and Hezbollah will come to al-Assad's rescue in case of a Libya-like scenario. Iran's supreme leader warned of a regional war in case of a military intervention in Syria. Absent that, Iran and Hezbollah will assess whether military action to prop up a regime whose political fortunes are rapidly declining will make a difference in preventing al-Assad's ouster, an outcome U.S. President Barack Obama describes as ""inevitable."" Despite all the rhetoric about a U.S.-Zionist conspiracy targeting the Syrian regime, the Iranian regime itself has been reaching out to Syrian opposition groups. Tehran's interest now lies in delaying the inevitable as long as possible while laying the groundwork for a working relationship with a post-al-Assad regime. Given the makeup of the opposition groups and Iran's pro-al-Assad stance, it is unlikely that Iran will be able to preserve the close alliance it has built and nurtured with the Syrian regime since the days of Hafez Assad. The best Iran could achieve is that whoever replaces al-Assad will not be hostile to Iran or to Hezbollah, Iran's main regional proxy. While it is hard to predict the final endgame in Syria, it is safe to argue that the failure at the United Nations Security Council to approve the Arab League proposal for an orderly transfer of power in Syria sets the stage for a protracted bloody stalemate between a brutal regime and a militarized opposition.

"(CNN) -- ""Congratulations!"" people said when I told them I was pregnant with my first child. Also, usually, ""What's your due date? Do you know what it is?"" And then, frequently -- and much to my surprise -- ""What book are you reading?"" It turns out you can't just up and have a baby. Many parents are now also subscribing to a particular parenting philosophy, often well in advance their little one's emergence into the world. For a soon-to-be new mom, it was overwhelming. What was the right book? Should I stick with the philosophies that make obvious sense to me, or consider some that seem like more dramatic departures? Did I even need a book at all? Heidi Murkoff, author of famed pregnancy guide ""What to Expect When You're Expecting,"" argued recently that this quest for guidance in books and online is at an all-time high. In a Daily Mail op-ed headlined ""Why I fear for modern mothers,"" she wrote that it stems from pressure on parents to be the best. ""Society's race for the perfect parenting prize has become all-consuming,"" she wrote. ""Whatever the group, everyone is locked in conflict and judging each other."" Studying books on parenting is really no new phenomenon. Ever since Dr. Benjamin Spock published ""The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care"" in 1946, parents have been reading up on the best way to raise their little ones. Spock's book was a parenting bible for many years, but also entertained its share of critics, from those who accused him of being anti-feminist, to those who claimed he fostered generations of spoiled brats, to those who blame him for an increase in violent crime. (Kids who grew up thinking it's OK to eschew broccoli probably also think it's OK to steal someone's car ... right?) But where once there was just Spock to follow (or not, as the case may be), there are now hundreds of parenting books to choose from, most of which seem to ride the same popularity roller coaster as Spock. A book might be celebrated one minute, but a few months down the line, a parent is a pariah for even having it on the shelf. Parents run the risk of reading a book, only to find it widely discredited mere weeks later. It seemed I had to accept that while books differ on how to parent, they all seem to suggest there's a right way to parent -- and they, the authors, know the secret. Several friends lent me ""The Contented Little Baby Book"" by Gina Ford, swearing by the schedule Ford delineates for parents. It includes, in some situations, letting your little one cry for a few minutes. But the idea of ""crying it out"" now has some detractors wringing their hands as it has become a subject of conflicting research findings. Another book, Pamela Druckerman's ""Bringing up Bebe,"" touts the French system to raising an independent-minded child who allows you to sleep, have dinner or maybe even a conversation. No-brainer, right? But the author also generated indignation, with one Forbes writer even accusing her of pushing a socialist agenda and ruining all our hopes for future generations of tyke-oons. Whether it's Amy Chua's push-your-kid method in ""Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,"" Dr. Bill Sears' let-your-kid-sleep-with-you plan, Ellen Galinsky's connection-before-correction or Tom Hodgkinson's advice to just chill and have a martini, the messages are different -- but strangely the same: You can screw your kids up, or you can make them great. It's all up to you, and whether you follow these wildly divergent instructions. Argh-gulp panic-middle-of-the-night-cold-sweat-anxiety. What if I choose the wrong child guru and ruin my offspring? Can you mix and match philosophies? What if by mixing and matching you just create some kind of a babymonster? What if I (gasp) don't read anything at all? ""In terms of controversies and the bombardment of information, [the prevalence of so many conflicting parenting books] is making things too complicated and very un-relaxing for parents"", says Dr. Richard Weissbourd, who teaches at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education and author of ""The Parents We Mean To Be."" In his book, Weissbourd looks at the pathologies parents themselves bring to the table, rather than just examining ways to parent. The book also examines the idea of ""over-parenting."" He believes many parents are too affected by ""the Joneses."" Not only are they feeling competitive in terms of what they've read, but they worry that by not not taking the same approaches as other parents, they're cheating their child out of opportunities. Trying to the absolute best parent can actually be damaging to children, the books suggests, and possibly pointless: There are no blanket ways to parent and there is often no right or wrong approach, Weissbourd argues. ""Books often tend to be too generic and get into all these debates,"" he said. "" It's more like, 'Who is my child and how can I be most constructive given what's going on with them?'"" Will Ferrell, in a ""Nerdist"" podcast, talks about how as a child he refused to take part in a gifted academic program at school, because it would interfere with his square-dancing classes. Ferrell's mom did not dissuade him, as some parents might have, and of course now he's, well, Will Ferrell. I wondered how Ferrell would have turned out if Amy Chua was his mom? Or what a Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld raised in the Ferrell household would look like? Possibly not at Harvard, like Chua, or on on ""Saturday Night Live,"" like Ferrell. ""There are certain things that are fundamental and if you do them reasonably well, the chances are your kid will be fine,"" Weissbourd says. ""Spending time, being warm, listening, creating reasonable expectations, caring for people, caring for yourself. Safeguarding your child's health and knowing basic health information."" It sounds a lot like ... Dr. Spock. Spock tells parents in the first chapter: ''Don't be afraid to trust your own common sense. What good mothers and fathers instinctively feel like doing for their babies is usually best."" So, I don't need a book? No need to read chapter two? Just do whatever I think is best? Perhaps. Weissbourd points out that this hyper-concern with reading parenting guides is largely divided among cultural and economic lines, and tends to be more of a middle- and upper-class issue. It's not that parents don't need guidance, he said, it's about where that guidance comes from. He believes parenting in the United States has become too private. Parents will gladly read books, but balk at feedback from people they know. We've all heard the line: ""Don't tell me how to raise my child!"" The takeaway, according to Weissbourd, is not to ignore parenting books altogether, which can sometimes offer practical tips, but that the best advice comes from those around you who know you and your little one. Not only is your child unique, but parents might be bringing their own issues to the table, and those might need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Consult a trusted pediatrician, consult people whose opinions you respect, consult your partner, Weissbourd advises. Find time to pause and reflect -- he advises, adding, ""I think everybody has got to relax."" For me and my new life with a newborn, the most appealing books turned out to be those where I could find an answer quickly. In Marc Weissbluth's ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child,"" I skipped the chapters that explained why sleep matters -- that seems startlingly obvious -- and went straight to the week-by-week instructions. The standard ""Your Baby's First Year"" by the American Academy of Pediatrics and Murkoff's ""What to Expect..."" books have been very helpful. I relied quite heavily on the Internet to give a variety of answers, making sure to check any advice with my pediatrician. With a baby, I think it's less about personality, more about practical help. I think the real market for parenting books is parents with older children. Parents of babies reading about what kind of parent to be are probably, like me, likely to gravitate toward books that espouse theories they probably already believe. I read ""Bringing up Bebe,"" because it resonated with ideas I already have about parenting, like teaching kids to enjoy ""grown-up"" foods from an early age (I might eat my words if my little one refuses everything but chicken fingers.) I like the idea of having a well-behaved child, as I imagine do most people. This is all very well and good in theory, but I think it's important to read a book that's realistic to the specific situation. Even though I liked ""Bringing up Bebe,"" it just might not be appropriate if my child is exceptionally shy. If a child has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for example, then reaching for Chua's ""Battle Hymn"" may not be the best shot. When faced with parenting hurdles further down the line, there won't be one easy answer, one book with all the fixes. I like to think I'll take the same approach I do as a journalist -- read several source, know what advice and opinions are out there, whether books, articles or conversations with other parents and my doctor. Most important, I think, as Dr. Spock advised years ago, I'll go with my gut. What parenting books do you love or hate? Share your experiences in the comments or on Facebook or Twitter!","New mom Katie Walmsley felt pressure to follow parenting ideas in different books .

"(CNN) -- Creating your own religion in the real world can result in weird looks, unusual friends and sometimes, visits from law enforcement officials. Creating your own religion in the soon-to-be-released expansion for ""Civilization V"" results in bonuses and benefits on your way to world domination. The new ""Civilization V: Gods and Kings"" expansion pack offers players two revamped elements to the iconic real-time strategy game -- faith and spies. Neither is entirely new to the franchise, but each has been redone to make it more interesting and rewarding to use. Faith is a new resource, like gold or science. Civilizations can accumulate faith by building shrines, temples and mosques. Acquire enough faith and your fledging country can discover its own pantheon of dieties. Pantheons reward players with bonuses based the way the player has played the rest of the game. As such, the player can decide what sort of beliefs the gods represent about their civilization. Bring enough followers to your cause and eventually you can create a fully formed religion (I called mine ""The Force""). You will also get additional bonuses to your civilization as a whole, and specific additions to city abilities. Later, you can enhance your religion and gain more benefits. There are a limited number of religions that can be created and not every country will get to create their own. This puts a premium on developing faith early in the game so you can acquire the bonuses best suited to your playing style. Religion was introduced in ""Civilization IV,"" but this expansion to ""Civ V"" boosts its abilities to offer benefits to the entire civilization. For instance, there was no condition for a religious victory in the preview build of the game. Religion passively crosses borders and spreads to neighboring civilizations, but active missionary work can only occur in friendly cities and city-states. The developers at Firaxis really tried to make religion something unique for each player and playing style. There are plenty of choices for beliefs and some new leaders players can control offer additional faith benefits. The preview build of ""Civ V"" ended in the year 1290 (189 turns) so it will be interesting to find out how religion plays out in the later stages of the game when it will have to compete with more technology-based units and goals. The second ""new"" unit is the Spy, but unlike its predecessor in other versions in the franchise, it isn't a specific unit to move around on the battlefield. The ""Gods and Kings"" expansion pack comes with a steampunk scenario called ""Empires of the Smokey Skies"" and offers a good opportunity to use the spies. The scenario starts out in the Steam Age and offers steampunkish new abilities and units, like the Land Leviathan and the Sky Fortress. The civilization leaders are decked out in top hats, wielding goggles and other trinkets you'd expect in a steampunk adventure. The goals of the scenario are also different from the traditional game. Become the leader in five different categories and you win. Spies play a big role here and help players keep an eye on their rivals. You can assign them to steal technology, find out information or kill enemy spies. They also will slant local voting in your favor to give you a better reputation in the city where they're working. In past ""Civilization"" iterations, spies would have to sneak their way to an enemy city, do one mission and hopefully escape with their lives. In ""Gods and Kings,"" spies stick around in the cities where they are assigned for as long as they want (provided they aren't discovered). This allows players to concentrate on other aspects of the game while still getting intelligence reports on their neighbors. Spies can be reassigned, but do you really want to risk an information black hole in the city you're leaving vacant? The ""Smokey Skies"" scenario was short, but offered the best chance to see the spies in action. I only recruited one spy in normal game play in turn 187 and that happened spontaneously. Will there be something in the later stages that helps players recruit more agents or train them better? ""Civilization V: Gods and Kings"" will offer more units, buildings, Wonders of the World and new civilizations to try out. Revamping the religious and spy elements will make the game even more thoughtful (if that's possible) and challenging for new and experienced players alike. ""One more turn"" just got a whole lot harder to avoid.","""Civilization"" expansion revamps religion and spies .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The defense attorney for one of two teenagers charged with fatally shooting a Georgia baby in the face spoke Wednesday about evidence in the case, saying speculation about the crime and evidence is complicating preparations for next month's trial. Public defender Kevin Gough, who represents De'Marquise ""Marky"" Elkins, said media reports have focused on ""evidence selectively disclosed by the police."" The investigation and prosecution have been ""heavy-handed,"" he said, and ""the state chooses to ignore obvious leads that are inconsistent with the state's theory of the case."" Gough said he issued his four-page statement because of an overwhelming number of media inquiries, and he said it would be his last before the trial in three weeks. Elkins and another teenager, Dominique Lang, have been charged with murder in the March 21 killing of 13-month-old Antonio Santiago. They were 17 and 14 at the time, respectively. The case has drawn national attention for the horrific nature of the child's death. The child's mother, Sherry West, has said two teenagers approached her in the street in broad daylight. One pointed a gun at her and told her that if she didn't give him her money he would shoot her and shoot her baby. West said that the teen fired at her, hitting her in one leg and barely missing her head. The teen then shot her child in the face, she said. Baby's death marks 2nd time Georgia mom loses a son to violence . Gough said the case against his client is best described as circumstantial. ""Contrary to speculation by some, there is no evidence of gunshot residue on Marky Elkins or upon his clothing. There is no murder weapon. There is no confession,"" he said in his statement. He said defense theories are evolving as the evidence develops, and he predicted further developments in the coming weeks. ""Much of what has been said about Mr. Elkins has been unkind, and much of that discussion has been based on false assumptions and misinformation,"" he said. Asked about Gough's statement on the gunshot residue, Mark Spaulding, a spokesman for the Glynn County district attorney's office, said, ""We don't have a comment on the record."" Elkins' mother, aunt and sister have also been arrested on various charges alleging that they have hindered the investigation. The sister, Sabrina Elkins, was named in a grand jury indictment accusing her of helping her mother get rid of the gun authorities say was used to kill the child. Police found that gun in a pond more than two miles from where the shooting happened. Gough said more witnesses should not be afraid to come forward.

"(CNN) -- Summer is the perfect time of year to dive into thrillers that will burn away the afternoon and make you forget about your job, the heat or your visiting in-laws. Two new page-turners out in July fit that description, breaking new ground in the techno-thriller genre, which draws upon themes in science fiction, espionage and action. Watching 'the social dominoes fall' Marcus Sakey's ""Brilliance"" is part science fiction, part high-speed chase with a healthy dose of ""Big Brother"" paranoia. Sakey imagines a world very much like our own, except the human species is just a bit more evolved. A tiny percentage of children are born with special gifts. They can tell if you're lying and move unseen in a crowd; a few are smart enough to manipulate the stock market like a Rubik's cube. To the families of these children, they're called ""brilliants."" To others who fear them, they're ""abnorms."" There is no 9/11 in the universe of ""Brilliance,"" but there is still a war on terrorism in which the abnorms are the enemy -- or are they? Sakey said the idea for the novel came came from his wife's research of childhood development. While some children with neural disorders face tremendous challenges in daily life, others have categorical knowledge of Latin dinosaur names or can find their way home just by looking at a map, he said. ""What if a small group of people have gifts like that only more powerful? What does that do to the rest of us?"" Sarkey said. ""I started building a whole world out from that idea and watched the social dominoes fall."" After a string of successful crime novels, Sakey said ""Brilliance"" was a pleasant change of pace. He worried, though, that it was just a matter of time before agents showed up at his door because of all the time he spent on the phone talking hypothetically about blowing up buildings, assassinating politicians and Islamic fundamentalism, he said. ""One of the fun things about writing this book was to parallel quite consciously a lot of the developments that have happened in our world."" Government agents haven't knocked on Sakey's door, yet but the book has grabbed Hollywood's attention. Legendary Pictures, the company behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception,"" recently snapped up film rights. Drawing inspiration from 'current affairs rage' Equally as fun and inventive is Charlie Huston's ""Skinner,"" an espionage thriller for the information age with echoes of John Le Carre and William Gibson. Skinner is a former CIA agent who specializes in ""asset protection."" He's part assassin, part bodyguard, part science experiment, having been raised by psychologist parents in a see-through plastic enclosure under 24-7 observation. Huston says the idea came to him after reading about scientists who used their children as part of their research and took it to an extreme in which parents raise their kids in a ""Skinner box."" Skinner grows up to become a cold, ruthless and detached killer toward enemies and targets. But if you're in trouble, you want him in your corner. Skinner guarantees the safety of those under his protection with a chilling maxim: ""The only true way to secure an asset is to ensure that the cost of acquiring it is greater than its value."" In other words, mess with Skinner's friends, and he will make you pay -- dearly. Even Skinner's employers fear him. Huston says the novel started out as a way channel his frustration with recent current events. ""I had what you might call current affairs rage, this kind of free floating anger directed at the faces of current events, politicians who can't get anything done,"" he said. Huston wanted to capture the frenetic pace of the 24-hour global news cycle. He hits the reader with missing nukes, rogue agents, a cyberattack on U.S. infrastructure, plastic guns made on 3D printers and even violent clashes between political protesters and nervous governments. There's even a global genocide meme. Through these touches, the story feels very up-to-the-minute and real, which is intentional, Huston said. ""I wanted it to feel like all of this stuff is going on right now. It's so relentless, a real blurring of time sense. Everything seems to be accelerating and happening at a faster and faster rate."" For all of its action and relevance in current affairs, readers will feel rewarded by the novel's hopeful ending. ""It's so easy to see all the problems we have and be overwhelmed by them,"" Huston said. ""I wanted the weak, the underclass to be empowered, to have an ending that was in some way optimistic because it's so easy to look at the world and be pessimistic. But as much reality as Huston could bring to his story, he couldn't keep up with everything. An Edward Snowden-type character is exactly what he wanted in the book, he said. ""If the story had broken just a month earlier, I could have gone back to the manuscript and put some references to it in there,"" he said. ""I can live with the fact that I don't have the Turkish protests or the Brazilian protests, but not having Snowden in there is just killing me. Can I change the second edition?""","Two new summer thrillers reimagine current affairs through a sci-fi lens .

"(CNN) -- Law student Blake Rider summed up the feelings of many Democrats late Tuesday night: . ""I can finally sleep again,"" he said. President Barack Obama was was re-elected with 303 electoral votes to Mitt Romney's 206. In a race that seemed too close to call until the votes were tallied, Americans ultimately chose four more years. Even though voters indicated to pollsters that their financial situation is the same or worse than it was four years ago, they put their trust in the president. Obama ""got off to a semi-rocky start, but I think that with another four years, we have a good chance,"" said Brian Anderson, who celebrated Obama's victory in the streets of Washington. ""We have a foundation now. ... We can only go up from here."" ""His re-election ... will allow me to stay in school and have health protection,"" agreed Atlanta college student Cydney Fisher. Like Fisher, many Americans considered health care when voting; exit polls had its importance second only to the economy. Mitt Romney supporters were obviously disappointed with the results of the close election, but they were comforted somewhat by the House of Representatives remaining under Republican control. ""Hopefully Obama can turn it around,"" wrote CNN.com commenter otacon7272. ""At least he won't be able to make things that much worse with the GOP in control of the House."" Others weren't quite so optimistic. ""I'm sorry, but what I see ahead for America is what we see in Third World countries now,"" said Kathi Cordsen of Fullerton, California. ""Everyone is poor except the government; everyone relies on the government for everything."" Members of both parties were quick to weigh in on what they'd like to see in the next four years. ""Let's see some action this time,"" said Dina Boyer of Palo Alto, California. She's an Obama supporter, but hopes the president's policies will have a more concrete effect on her life in the next four years, such as allowing her to make a living wage and stop using food stamps. ""I would also like to see a New Deal of sorts, more money put into rebuilding states and cities hit by disaster or economic ruin."" ""I want to see Obama get spending under control,"" said Romney voter Elizabeth Lauten. The D.C. resident had hoped that Romney would cut the deficit if he won. ""I think (Obama) believes he wants to increase taxes on the wealthy. I don't agree with that, but there has to be a solution."" And some questioned whether the election would make much of a difference to the country at all. ""I see little being accomplished unless members of Congress and the president finally start talking with one another, find where they can agree and do what is right for we, the people,"" said Republican Mark Ivy of Farmersburg, Indiana. ""I am not sure if either Republicans or Democrats will be that willing to compromise. Once elected, we expect our officials to lay aside the party hats and work for all Americans. I am afraid they won't."" But Rider -- the sleepless Obama voter who can finally get some rest -- disagrees. ""I think it has a profound impact,"" he said. ""I just think (it) is a fundamental question of which direction we want to take -- there is symbolism here."" Opinion: Five things Obama must do .

"(CNN) -- There are few criminal events as stunning and frightening as a mass shooting. The suddenness, randomness and unpredictability of episodes like Friday's early morning massacre at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater cause us all to wonder whether any place is safe. In our search for some pattern or commonality to these tragedies that might help us make sense of what appears so senseless, we invariably seek answers to such questions as: ""What would inspire someone to commit such a dreadful act, one that was clearly planned in terms of time and place?"" and ""Are there measures that would reduce the likelihood of such events or at least reduce the carnage associated with them when they do occur?"" News: Gunman kills 12 in Colorado movie theater . Because the shooting suspect was alive at the scene -- many mass killers commit suicide -- we might learn a lot more than usual about a motive for mass murder. Of course, that will do little to help us prevent future events. (The number of mass murders in the U.S. has remained fairly steady, averaging about two dozen cases a year since the mid-1970s.) Even though there is a general profile that typifies these perpetrators, their exact identities become crystal clear only in the aftermath. If one thing is predictable about mass shootings, however, is that they will spark arguments from gun control advocates and gun rights groups alike. Both sides of the gun issue will probably view this tragedy as one more example of why more or less gun control is the answer ... and both sides will be wrong. Tighter restrictions on gun purchasing -- for example, eliminating multiple gun sales and closing the gun-show loophole -- may help reduce America's gun violence problem generally, but mass murder is unlike most other forms of violent conflict. News: Shooting turns theater into surreal horror -- 'This is real' Mass killers are determined, deliberate and dead-set on murder. They plan methodically to execute their victims, finding the means no matter what laws or other impediments the state attempts to place in their way. To them, the will to kill cannot be denied. Mass shootings have been exploited just as effectively by pro-gun groups to promote legislation allowing ordinary citizens to carry concealed weapons in public places. Concealed-carry proponents suggest that an armed citizenry would deter criminals or at least reduce the death toll. iReporter: 'AK-47 a weapon for war' While logical in theory, in the chaos of the moment, few gun owners would be prepared to mount an effective counterattack. And in a crowded setting, such as the movie theater clouded with tear gas and smoke, it would be virtually impossible to distinguish the bad guy with a gun from the good guys with their guns. In the short term, there will probably be security specialists who will recommend ways in which our public spaces could be better protected. Sadly, mass shootings have occurred in shopping malls, schools, restaurants, health clubs, churches, courthouses, post offices, almost any place that people congregate. None of us would wish to turn our public spaces into tightly secured fortresses. News: Shooting victim details emerge . It is also unreasonable to expect that we would begin a campaign to round up all the guns or all the potentially dangerous people who might have access to guns. Mass murder is regrettably one of the painful consequences of the freedoms we enjoy. Postscript: I do support wholeheartedly certain reasonable gun restrictions -- steps designed to reduce our nation's overall rate of firearms violence. Still, murder in its most extreme form, as in the Colorado shooting, is particularly difficult to prevent through gun regulations, or other strategies, for that matter. Of course, that doesn't mean we shouldn't try nonetheless. In light of the shooting, what are your thoughts on gun control and safety in public spaces? Let us know on CNN iReport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Alan Fox.","James Fox: When a mass shooting happens, we search for answers .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With less than two weeks before federal money runs out for transportation projects across the country, a partisan showdown is developing between Senate Democrats and House Republicans over passing a new bill. The standoff, based on sharply differing views about the overall expense of the bill and how to pay for it, jeopardizes thousands of road and bridge construction projects. On Wednesday, House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Florida, said the House would soon pass a three-month extension of existing funding to provide time for negotiations over a longer-term bill. But that idea was rejected by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who said Tuesday he was ""inclined not to"" pass a temporary funding extension. Instead, Reid said House Republicans should accept a two-year, $109 billion bill that recently passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support. Reid said tea party activists are to blame for the House's refusal to consider the Senate bill. ""Millions of people depend on this highway bill that has passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis,"" Reid said. ""They depend on it for their jobs. But it seems to me that the House has come to the conclusion, led by the House leadership, that they can't do anything unless they get a permission slip from the tea party."" Asked about Reid's refusal to consider a short-term bill, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said Reid is taking a risk. ""I'm sure that Majority Leader Reid does not want to cause any disruption in the flow of transportation dollars to the states or into the federal programs,"" Cantor said. House passage of a temporary bill could put Democrats under enormous pressure not to let funding dry up. Permitting thousands of construction jobs to go idle, just as the economy begins to recover, could backfire on lawmakers, especially those seeking re-election. House GOP leaders are having trouble getting enough support for their five-year, roughly $260 billion version of the usually popular bill, partly because fiscal conservatives say it's too expensive and should be scaled back. House Democrats, meanwhile, say the bill is a non-starter because it calls for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said recently it was possible that the House would take up the Senate bill, partially as a way to try to persuade wavering Republicans to come around and support the House GOP version. A three-month extension would give Boehner and his lieutenants more time to try again to round up votes. ""A short-term extension will give us time to build support for real, long-term reforms, including linking transportation funding to expanded American energy production -- which would lower costs, reduce our dependence on foreign energy, and create millions of American jobs,"" Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said. Mica told reporters the House is expected to vote on the short-term measure next week before it leaves for a two-week recess.","The House is considering a GOP-backed 3-month extension of funding .

"(CNN) -- I can pinpoint the exact moment that put me on a path to moderate San Diego Comic-Con's first anti-bullying panel last weekend. It happened 32 months ago, when I published a blog post about my first-grade daughter Katie, who was taunted for carrying a ""Star Wars"" water bottle and backpack. It was the post that launched a thousand geeks, and then 5,000 tweets. Over the next weeks and months, I read a near-constant stream of e-mails, letters and messages from people around the world who wanted to share their own stories of bullying and peer victimization. The story touched the collective nerve of a very motivated and tech-savvy group of people, who took my daughter in as one of their own. My husband and I like to say that we were the first ones to adopt Katie, and the self-proclaimed geeks and nerds adopted her six years later. The kindness of strangers to our family served as the catalyst for my transition to full-time work as an anti-bullying advocate. After interviewing hundreds of people, including parents, teachers, kids, bullies, victims, bystanders, researchers, psychologists, lawmakers, celebrities and social workers, I wrote a book about why bullying persists in our culture and how we can end the cycle of fear. But even within geek culture, there is still a vast amount of peer victimization, harassment and bullying. The gaming industry has been plagued by a hotbed of vicious attacks -- male gamers versus female gamers and hardcore gamers versus casual gamers, with issues of misogyny and homophobia and discrimination coming to the forefront of our collective consciousness. Within cosplay, people attack each other over myriad issues: Is the costume authentic? Does the person have the right body shape or ethnicity for the chosen costume? The roles of bullies and victims can sometimes be blurry, especially when someone who was bullied as a child grows up to be the aggressor. In a world that likes to simplify goodies versus baddies, bullying dynamics are not always so simple to deconstruct. Comic-Con is widely revered as the mecca of pop culture conventions, but it had never hosted a conversation directly about bullying. Just as parents, kids and communities are talking about social cruelty in schools and online, I wanted to keep the discussion going among geeks and nerds. We need an opportunity to reach the content creators and ask: How can we respond to messages of bullying perpetuated by entertainment media while retaining dynamic narratives in music, movies, video games and comics? Two years ago at the first GeekGirlCon, I met Chase Masterson, who played Leeta during the final five seasons of ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9."" Masterson has mentored kids in gangs for many years, and she views bullying prevention as a passion project. ""There's strength in the knowledge that countless bullied kids, who have felt so hopeless, have overcome that pain and have rich, fulfilling lives and relationships. And people who have been bullied have a unique ability to become compassionate voices, leaders and champions over oppression; the potential for healing to conquer injustice is huge,"" she explained. A bite-size tour of Comic-Con . At Comic-Con, Masterson and I debuted the newly formed Anti-Bullying Coalition to lead conversations about a wide range of bullying issues. How can we get society to stop blaming the victim? How can we create safer spaces for GLBT kids? How do we empower kids to speak up for others who are being victimized? How do we raise children who are neither bullies nor victims? The questions flew back and forth, bandied about by Coalition members such as No H8 Campaign, the United Nations Association, Cartoon Network's Stop Bullying: Speak Up, the Anti-Defamation League and GLSEN. At one point I stood back and looked around, equal parts grateful and amazed to be part of the discussion. Surrounded by people in elaborate costumes, listening to the noise and excitement, I recalled the moment 32 months ago when I was just another worried mom, wondering how to help my kid. That moment led me here. Comic-Con is serving as a model for other conventions by addressing the issue of bullying. There is space for fun and games as well as tackling the more serious issues that affect convention-goers. Comic conventions provide a common forum for those with passionate -- even obsessive -- interests, and the same people who were once taunted for dressing as Superman in school are now celebrated as cosplayers at a con. Indeed, some of the strongest voices of support for Katie came from the 501st Legion, an international charitable organization dedicated to creating exact costume replications of characters from Star Wars. When Katie mentioned that she would like to be a Stormtrooper for Halloween last year, the 501st Legion put out a call to action, and members worldwide donated parts for a miniature set of armor. The Midwest Garrison assembled the costume and presented it to Katie in a ceremony that ended with her hugging Darth Vader. After Katie outgrows the armor, we'll donate it back to the 501st so it can be passed to another child, most likely through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Katie, who is off at sleep-away camp, was unable to attend Comic-Con. But she was with me every step of the way. Late Sunday afternoon, in the final hour of the final day of the con, the first-ever anti-bullying panel took place. From the moment I posed the first question to writer Jane Espenson of ""Once Upon a Time"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" to the very last comments by Masterson, the room was full. Every person stayed. Within hours of the panel ending, tweets were already coming in from people asking us to bring anti-bullying panels to other pop culture conventions. Leaders in the geek community are spreading the word. I think back to the first moments of the panel, when I said to the room, ""Raise your hand if you still remember a specific incidence of being taunted from more than a decade ago."" The sheer number of hands in the air served as testimony to the power of hurt feelings to linger. From now on, Comic-Con convention-goers will come for cosplay, entertainment, freebies, autographs -- and healing.","Author Carrie Goldman moderated the first anti-bullying panel at San Diego Comic-Con .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea has said it will press on with its nuclear program as a response to what it described as hostility from the United States after an analysis of satellite images indicated increased activity at its nuclear test site. ""We had access to nuclear deterrence for self-defense because of the hostile policy of the U.S. to stifle the DPRK by force and we will expand and bolster it nonstop as long as this hostile policy goes on,"" an unidentified spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a report Tuesday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. DPRK is short for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. The top U.S. envoy for North Korea, Glyn Davies, warned Pyongyang on Monday that a possible third nuclear test would be ""a serious miscalculation and mistake."" The North Korean official suggested Tuesday that a nuclear test had not originally been part of the regime's plans. ""We did not envisage such a military measure as a nuclear test as we planned to launch a scientific and technical satellite for peaceful purposes,"" he said. But the statement concluded with a vague threat: ""If the U.S. persists in its moves to ratchet up sanctions and pressure upon us despite our peace-loving efforts, we will be left with no option but to take counter-measures for self-defense."" North Korea launched a rocket on April 13, which failed less than two minutes into the flight. It said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology. The move torpedoed a deal reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments from the United States. Many analysts assume an atomic test by North Korea is just a matter of time following the failure of the rocket launch last month. Two previous rocket launches in 2006 and 2009 were followed weeks or months later by nuclear tests. And activity is being ramped up at North Korea's nuclear test site, a sign that the country is preparing for a test, according to an analysis of new satellite images by the defense publication IHS Janes. Mining carts and excavation equipment at Punggye-ri's tunneling area can be seen in satellite images taken by Digital Globe and GeoEye in the past month. Earth and debris are being removed from the tunnel in the largest quantities seen so far, according to the Janes assessment. An image from mid-April shows a full mining train, including an engine and several carts, outside of the tunnel. And a more recent shot on May 9 reveals new road networks at the site along with carts and a vehicle at the facility. In the statement Tuesday, North Korea denounced as ""absolutely intolerable"" a declaration from the Group of 8 leaders over the weekend, which stated that Pyongyang faces more isolation if it continues its pursuit of a nuclear program. CNN's Jennifer Rizzo contributed to this report .","An analysis of satellite images shows increased activity at North Korea's nuclear site .

"Pretoria (CNN) -- Handwritten messages pinned to a makeshift memorial board outside a Pretoria hospital describe the fear and resignation felt by many ordinary South Africans that Nelson Mandela may not be with them much longer. ""You are and will always be a true legend and grandfather to us all,"" reads one note tied around the neck of a little white bear. Another, placed with a bunch of proteas, the country's national flower, says ""Tata Mandela you have touched our lives and blessed us in more ways than one. We love you."" Many of the messages appear to be written by children, in colored glue and pen, including one which features the hand prints of children still far too young to understand the indelible mark the former president has left on their country. The touching and very personal tributes started appearing on the wall on June 8, the day Mandela was admitted to hospital for a recurring lung infection. However, what was hoped to be a short stint has stretched into its 19th day, the longest period of hospitalization ever for a man known not for his physical strength but personal fortitude. Headlines in local newspapers leave little doubt about the challenges Mandela, or Madiba as he's known here, faces after a life of struggle at the age of 94. Against a predominantly black front page, the Daily Sun's lead headline reads: ""The Final Struggle,"" with the sub headline ""Critical Hours for Madiba."" On Sunday, President Jacob Zuma announced that Mandela's condition had slipped from stable to critical, prompting a private meeting of his closest family members Tuesday. It's not known what they discussed but the meeting added further worry as onlookers waited for an update from the presidential office on Mandela's condition. Since his condition worsened on Sunday, media crews from around the world have made their way to the street outside the Medi-Clinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria. Late Tuesday, in an ominous sign, large numbers of police officers descended on the area, setting up road blocks at either end of the Celliers street, where the hospital is located. Pedestrians are being allowed to move back and forth across the barriers, as are cars, but most media crews remain parked for fear of losing their space in what's fast becoming a very crowded street. A number of satellite trucks have been moved into position, beaming live broadcasts around the world -- further evidence, if any is needed, of Mandela's influence beyond the borders of his homeland. In between reports, journalists struggle to stay warm; it's winter in South Africa and while the sun warms the air throughout the day, at night temperatures fall below freezing. No one knows how long the wait will last. If the darkening mood is anything to go by, it may not be long until South Africa is forced to confront the reality that some hoped would never come.","Mood darkens in South Africa as Nelson Mandela's condition remains critical .

"(CNN) -- Reptiles are the biggest thing on Vogue UK's website right now, but not as boots or bags.

"(CNN) -- The drought of 2012 will be one that farmers and ranchers remember for years to come. My husband, Kevin, and I are fifth-generation farmers. This is the first drought we have experienced since we were married and started farming together in 1995. Our farm, like most other U.S. farms, is really suffering right now and in desperate need of rain. The media have pegged it right: it definitely is the worst drought of our generation. Kevin and I own and raise hogs, cattle, corn, soybeans and alfalfa hay on our farm. Typically, we don't have a lot of crops to farm, but this year we decided to rent an extra 200 acres for that purpose, doubling our row-crop acreage. We were able to purchase crop insurance for most of our crops, but unfortunately that alone will not help make our farm or equipment payments to the bank since most of our crops are ruined. Our crop failure isn't what keeps me awake at night these days; it's worrying about our animals. No crops means no feed for livestock. We can't stop feeding cattle and hogs. We own 60 head of cattle, and our family has 1,500 sows on our farm. Bountiful crops are needed for an adequate feed supply, but so too are healthy pastures for cattle grazing. Both need rain. Hogs eat mostly corn and soybeans because they are not ruminant animals, which means they do not have four stomach chambers like cattle, which can digest hay and grass. The price to purchase corn and soybeans is skyrocketing because of crop losses across most of the United States. Unlike crop farmers, livestock farmers and ranchers do not have insurance programs to ease the losses during disaster years. When our feed costs get out of control, or when a disease devastates our herd, there is no relief from insurance. This is a total loss for farmers and ranchers. To pay the bills, we have to go to the bank and borrow more money to help us survive the storm. This means yet another loan payment. When my expenses increase on our farm, it would be nice to tell the packer who buys my hogs that I need to be paid more so I can make ends meet. But it doesn't work that way. Hogs feel drought's pinch . We are price takers; supply and demand drive the price we are paid for hogs. Even though my feed bills are increasing at alarming rates, right now it doesn't mean that pork demand has increased in line with my expenses. Farmers have to wait for an increase in demand, or decrease in supply, to see their prices increase. I have been asked before why I just don't hold on to our hogs and wait for someone to pay me what I need to pay my feed bills. This is because packers only accept a certain weight so they can meet consumer demand. Consumers want a consistent size piece of pork -- not too big or too small --and they want their chops to look the same each time they go to the store. To meet this demand, farmers can't sell hogs that are overweight or underweight. The pain of this drought doesn't stop with farmers and ranchers. Everyone has a vested interest in how Mother Nature is behaving. Food availability will be affected because farmers will be producing less food. In the end, this will lead to increased food prices. A number of livestock farmers and ranchers will be faced with difficult decisions. Some will be forced to leave the farm or ranch and find new jobs in neighboring towns, while others may have to sell their family farm or ranch. The bottom line is: If you eat, this drought will affect you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Chinn.","Chris Chinn's farm has been badly affected by the drought .
She says the bill to feed her livestock is increasing fast because of crop losses .

"(CNN) -- Chinese health authorities have promised an overhaul in hospitals across the country following the arrest of an obstetrician for allegedly selling newborns to human traffickers, state media reports. Police in Fuping County in China's northwestern Shaanxi Province said that the doctor in question, Zhang Shuxia, had allegedly sold other babies to traffickers in the past. Police were investigating 10 similar cases at Fuping County Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, where Zhang was deputy director of the maternity department, reported state-run CCTV. The latest baby was returned to its parents amid emotional scenes on Monday, after its identity was confirmed through DNA testing. As family members wept, the parents knelt to thank police for recovering their son, the state-run China Daily reported. Fuping County authorities said the baby boy had been allegedly sold for 21,600 yuan ($3,527) by Zhang on July 17, the day after he was born. The baby was then sold two more times in ten days. Police said Zhang had allegedly told the child's parents, Dong Shanshan and Lai Guofeng, that their son had contracted syphilis through the mother, and convinced them to surrender the boy into her care, reported the state-run People's Daily. But when the mother subsequently tested negative for syphilis, she grew suspicious and reported what had happened to police. The infant was eventually found in a good condition in a town in neighboring Henan Province Sunday. Zhang and five other suspects have been detained on suspicion of human trafficking, reported Xinhua. CCTV cited six other alleged trafficking cases involving Zhang dating back to 2006, including a pair of twins earlier this year. Health issues cited by Zhang in convincing the parents to surrender their children included heart problems, cerebral palsy and missing genitals. It reported that most of the affected families hailed from the village of Xue in Fuping County -- the home of Zhang and her mother. Another couple from the area told CCTV Zhang had convinced them to give up their baby son at the hospital in 2008, after telling them shortly after the birth that the infant had stopped breathing. ""The whole delivery was around 10 minutes, natural birth. And then she came out and told me that the baby wasn't breathing,"" recalled Dong Pengfei, the father. ""I was overwhelmed by that time, and I didn't have second thoughts. But after that I've been thinking why she would refer to it as a 'kid' if it wasn't breathing."" ""I couldn't stop crying ever since I gave birth to my boy,"" his wife told CCTV. ""I feel like crying when I see kids from other families."" China's state health commission has called for severe punishment for those involved. ""(The commission's leadership) see it as morally degraded, illegal and intolerable,"" said Mao Qunan, spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The commission vowed to impose stricter management of medical services and implement stronger ethics training across the country to prevent similar cases.

"(CNN) -- How times have changed. More than 30 years ago, Irvin Kershner was announced as the director of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" the first sequel to ""Star Wars."" Kershner was a curious choice -- a director of documentaries, star vehicles and TV episodes -- but in the days before the Internet, the announcement raised hardly a fuss. On the other hand, last week J.J. Abrams -- a seemingly unimpeachable choice, with his producing, directing and writing experiences on ""Lost,"" ""Fringe,"" ""Super 8"" and the rebooted ""Star Trek"" -- was announced as the director of the forthcoming ""Star Wars VII."" And the world went nuts. ""Another franchise for him to ruin,"" a reader named ""hey"" wrote on CNN's Marquee blog. ""Lost sucked, cloverfield sucked and now the new star wars movies are going to suck worse than the last 3,"" added screen name ""horrible pick."" Whew. Can you imagine what kind of reaction Kershner would have gotten? ""There would have been blood in the water,"" says Shaun Rosado, a pop-culture blogger who puts out a weekly podcast called Shauncastic! But that's the world we live in now, says Suzanne Scott, a self-described ""fan-scholar"" who teaches at Occidental College in Los Angeles. ""What I find so interesting is, when you talk about the online, 24-hour news cycle, you have these knee-jerk responses. It's panic,"" she says. ""It shows the power and pervasiveness of fan culture."" Rosado understands the concern. ""In the annals of geek history, there's always been the argument: Which one is better, 'Star Wars' or 'Star Trek'? And until this point, we've never had a director sit down and do both of them,"" he says. ""This is the first time, where we will literally have somebody who's played both sides of the field, and I think a lot of nerds and geeks are a little bit terrified of that."" After 100 episodes, 'Fringe' cast bids farewell . Lucas 2.0 . Since getting the job -- after initial reports he wasn't interested -- Abrams has at least said all the right things. ""To be a part of the next chapter of the 'Star Wars' saga ... is an absolute honor,"" Abrams said in a statement released by Disney, which owns Lucas' production company Lucasfilm. ""I may be even more grateful to George Lucas now than I was as a kid."" Moreover, Lucas has given his blessing. ""I've consistently been impressed with J.J. as a filmmaker and storyteller,"" Lucas said. ""He's an ideal choice to direct the new 'Star Wars' film, and the legacy couldn't be in better hands."" Certainly Abrams would seem a logical selection. He's kind of a ""Lucas 2.0,"" with his producing, directing and writing experience. ""Hate him or love him, here's a guy who's worked in multiple genres across multiple media and has his own production company -- which is way more established than George Lucas was when 'Star Wars' came out,"" says Dan Herbert, a film professor at the University of Michigan. It's good to be J.J. Abrams . Abrams says the original 1977 film left a lasting impression on him. ""As a kid I was always a fan of special effects,"" he told Entertainment Weekly in November. ""Watching movies I was constantly trying to figure out how they did it, whatever the effect was. 'Star Wars' was the first movie that blew my mind in that way."" He added, ""It galvanized for me; not for what was exciting about how movies were made, but rather for what movies were capable of."" ""Star Wars,"" of course, has been capable of quite a lot. The first film invented the modern sci-fi blockbuster, observes Herbert, and helped redefine America's movie-going habits. And over the years, the ""Star Wars"" universe has spawned books, television shows, video games, parodies and -- above all -- an array of merchandise that has given the fans themselves control over the story. It's the reason there's such anger when Lucas, whose empire rests on ""Star Wars'"" foundation, decides to assert his authorship over the scriptures -- whether it's maintaining that Han Solo wasn't a cold-blooded murderer (""Han shot first!"" goes a common refrain among fans, noting that the smuggler played by Harrison Ford actually shot the bounty hunter Greedo unchallenged) or creates a character such as Jar Jar Binks, the goofy, child-friendly Gungan who was called a ""Rastafarian Stepin Fetchit"" by film critic Joe Morgenstern. In response to the annoyance with Binks, one fan created a Jar Jar-less version that's come to be known as ""The Phantom Edit."" Scott says she believes the conflict arises from the ""old-media"" Lucas clashing with a savvy, post-Internet fan base. ""Lucas had an analog approach -- 'It's mine, I can do whatever I want,'"" she says. ""It's almost borderline hostile."" The fans, on the other hand, have already taken ""Star Wars"" places Lucas never imagined, and they weren't shy about expressing their dismay with the second trilogy of films, all of which were written and directed by Lucas. There's something ""organic"" about ""Star Wars,"" says Scott, and Lucas tampered with that feeling when he made the newer films -- particularly thanks to his sometimes ham-fisted screenwriting. ""The (second trilogy) also feels synthetic in terms of plot,"" says Scott, ""and most fans blame Lucas the screenwriter for that."" Bridging worlds . The fans aren't the only ones. The general consensus on the first film's script, also written by Lucas, was best summed up by Harrison Ford, who famously told the writer-director, ""George, you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can't say it."" The scripts improved for the second and third films, ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi,"" thanks to the participation of writers Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett. Rosado believes ""Star Wars VII,"" which will feature a script by ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Toy Story 3"" screenwriter Michael Arndt, will make the new movie a must-see for fans as much as Abrams' involvement will. ""[Arndt] likes to develop characters, and that's something that J.J. Abrams is also well-known for doing,"" he says. ""If you look at the prequels, which a lot of fans malign, it's because of that special attention that wasn't given to (the characters)."" The new movie also gives the franchise a chance to reach a new generation -- something that was undoubtedly on Disney's mind when the studio purchased Lucasfilm last year for $4 billion. Rosado foresees more synergy with Disney's theme parks; Herbert sees an opportunity to make the post-""Star Wars"" generation excited about the franchise, perhaps for the first time. 'Star Wars' Episodes II and III in 3-D delayed . Herbert has noticed that his current students, who were born in the early '90s, no longer find ""Star Wars"" a touchstone. ""For them, there's less specialness because the ripple effect of 'Star Wars' had already taken hold,"" he says. For these under-25s, the new film is ""about extending the life of the brand, because it doesn't have a life right now."" And Abrams, the master of the reboot -- besides ""Star Trek,"" he also directed ""Mission: Impossible 3"" -- may be just the guy to do it. At the very least, says Rosado, he and Arndt can provide a counterweight to Lucas and give ""Star Wars VII"" a different attitude, with more fun and depth than the second trilogy had. After all, that's what Kershner and Kasdan did with ""Empire,"" which is widely considered the best of the six ""Star Wars"" films. ""As much as I love the idea of George Lucas and all of his crazy concepts, he is at his best when someone else is realizing his vision for him,"" he says. ""Empire"" has that imprint, he says. So do the novelizations, comic books and video games. Regardless of what the future brings, Scott is trying to relax. The news about Abrams and Arndt has helped, but she's been burned before. ""I'm always going to keep my guard up, ever since the prequels,"" she says. Perhaps the Empire is listening this time.","On January 25, Disney announced J.J. Abrams would direct new ""Star Wars""

"(CNN) -- Global debate over the Syrian crisis is expected to ratchet up this week, with Russian and European Union leaders grappling with the thorny issue and U.N. members reassessing whether to take further action. Kofi Annan, joint envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League, will meet Friday with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington to discuss Syria, sources told CNN. The crisis that has killed thousands over 15 months was expected to dominate the agenda at the EU-Russia Summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Monday. World leaders have accused Russia of supporting and selling arms to the Syrian regime -- assertions that Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied. China, meanwhile, assumed the revolving presidency of the U.N. Security Council. China and Russia are the only members of the council that have repeatedly barred attempts to formally condemn the Syrian government. But a commentary in China's state-run People's Daily newspaper held out hope for a struggling peace plan and warned against military intervention in Syria. ""The international community should support Annan's peace plan instead of losing confidence and patience,"" the paper said. If the Annan plan is blocked, ""then it will most likely push this country into the abyss of full-scale war."" A full-scale civil war would trigger Western military intervention and severe consequences, the People's Daily said. ""Mass civilian casualties, enormous property losses, an increasingly turbulent society ... the lessons learnt from mistakes made in Libya are still fresh,"" the paper said. In Syria on Monday, 42 people were killed Monday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The LCC posted a letter on its Facebook page slamming Russia and China for blocking tougher action against Syria, and criticizing the U.N. observer mission in the country. ""Based on our own investigation, we have determined that the U.N. observer mission has consciously provided the regime with political cover. Therefore, the U.N. observer mission is not substantively different from that found in the Arab League's observer mission. The practices of the U.N. observers on the ground confirm that their current mission has been convoluted with political goals, and this is tantamount to putting the cart before the horse."" ""Since the beginning of the uprising, the regime has systematically resorted to lies, claiming the existence of Islamic fundamentalists, Palestinian gunmen and terrorists as part of a vile foreign conspiracy to change the power structure and its relationship to society,"" the LCC wrote. ""The regime's survival, in fact, has become completely dependent on foreign forms of political, economic, military and technical support."" It called on the Security Council and Annan to ""take note of the need for the U.N. observers' mission to evolve to include a role for the International Criminal Court to undertake an investigation and verify who is responsible for the gunfire and violence."" Syria, meanwhile, said on state-run media that 30 ""army and law enforcement martyrs"" were buried Monday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said about 100 government soldiers have been killed by rebel fighters during the past three days. Al-Assad denied Sunday that government forces were behind the recent ""outrageous"" massacre of more than 100 civilians, including dozens of small children, in the town of Houla. ""Truthfully, even monsters do not do what we saw, especially in the Houla massacre,"" he told lawmakers. ""The criminal or criminals who committed this crime and others are not criminals for an hour or criminals for a day, they are constant criminals and are surely planning other crimes."" Speaking before the newly elected People's Assembly, al-Assad decried what he called terrorists and the conspiracy against Syria. ""At this time, we are facing a war from abroad,"" al-Assad said in his first public speech since January. ""Dealing with it is different from dealing with people from inside."" His speech came more than a week after the U.N. Security Council condemned the Houla massacre, with members casting blame on government forces for the deaths. Opinion: Is Syria unsolvable? Al-Assad's remarks stand in stark contrast to what the opposition and many world leaders have said for more than a year: that al-Assad's forces, not ""terrorists,"" are behind a sustained slaughter stemming from the regime's crackdown on dissidents. As the president spoke, shells rained on the anti-government bastion of Homs, the LCC said. Thirty-seven people were killed Sunday in Syria, five of them children, the group said. Al-Assad's address came a day after Annan said that ""the specter of all-out civil war, with a worrying sectarian dimension, grows by the day."" Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, said the Syrian regime is pushing for a sectarian crisis. ""The Syrian opposition lacks the means to defend itself, and the regime is getting weapons from everywhere,"" he said Sunday. ""For a while now, we noticed that the regime has been trying to turn the crisis into a sectarian conflict."" He added that, while Syria had agreed to Annan's peace plan, the regime has not implemented it. ""The regime just wants to buy time,"" Al Faisal said. At a meeting of Arab League foreign ministers Saturday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani said Annan's peace initiative should be placed under Chapter VII of the U.N. charter, Qatar's news agency reported Saturday. Such a move would allow the U.N. Security Council to take action that could include military force. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday that he had taken note of the Arab League leaders' suggestions, including requests to increase the number of U.N. observers and to set a time limit for the effort. ""All these are very important recommendations, and I hope these will be discussed by the Security Council members. At this time, I would welcome the wider international discussions on the future course of action,"" Ban told reporters. The crisis in Syria began nearly 15 months ago, when a tough government crackdown on protesters spiraled out of control and spawned a national anti-government uprising. Al-Assad's family has ruled Syria for 42 years. The United Nations for months has said more than 9,000 people have died in Syria. But death counts from opposition groups range from more than 12,000 to more than 14,000. Tens of thousands have been displaced. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or violence from Syria because the government restricts access to foreign journalists. CNN's Saad Abedine, Holly Yan, Tian Shao, Tracy Doueiry and Richard Roth contributed to this report.","NEW: Opposition says 42 people were killed Monday; Syria says 30 ""martyrs"" were buried .

"(CNN) -- A Virginia judge on Tuesday sent to a grand jury the case against a man accused of abducting a 12-year-old girl whose mother was later found dead. Roanoke County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Judge Philip Trompeter found probable cause during a preliminary hearing for Jeffrey Scott Easley, who is accused of taking the girl across the country before being spotted outside a San Francisco supermarket. The judge also denied Easley's bond request, Roanoke County spokeswoman Teresa Hall said. Theresa Shanley in December spotted Easley, 32, and the girl outside a Safeway store in the Richmond district of San Francisco, then alerted police. Easley was subsequently arrested on abduction charges, as well as counts of credit card theft and credit card fraud. He waived extradition. Roanoke County Police Chief Ray Lavinder has said Easley is a ""very good suspect"" in the murder of Tina Smith, the mother of the girl he allegedly abducted. No one has been charged in the 41-year-old woman's death. For now, only the abduction charge will go to the April 1 grand jury, Hall said. Easley's attorney, Thomas W. Roe Jr., said his client will contest any and all allegations. Prosecutors are awaiting the return of DNA laboratory results before proceeding with any charges in Tina Smith's death, Hall said. In January, Easley wrote a letter to the Roanoke Times, saying the girl was his willing cross-country companion. ""I did not kidnapp her or take her aginest her will,"" Easley, 32, wrote in a misspelled letter postmarked from the Western Virginia Regional Jail. ""She made me promise not to leave her."" ""Obviously, we differ,"" said Hall. ""We feel she was taken against her will."" During Tuesday's preliminary hearing, the girl's father, Benjamin Smith, said an order that forbade him having contact with his daughter had been lifted by the time she disappeared, Hall said. Smith testified that Easley did not have his permission to take the girl out of state. The girl did not testify Tuesday. Police believe that Tina Smith, who was Easley's girlfriend, was killed between the morning and evening of December 3. Lavinder in December said authorities believe Easley and Smith's daughter left Virginia that night or early the next day. They traveled cross-country in Tina Smith's silver 2005 Dodge Neon sedan, which was found in a parking lot adjacent to San Francisco International Airport after authorities found Easley. An Amber Alert was issued for the girl December 6, after police found Tina Smith's body inside her Salem home and discovered that her daughter was missing. From the beginning, public notices named Easley as the girl's alleged abductor. Shanley said she saw the girl sitting on a curb outside the northern California store while Easley was begging for money. The Safeway was within walking distance of a makeshift campsite containing a tent in which Easley and the girl had been staying. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Jeffrey Scott Easley is accused of taking a 12-year-old girl on a cross-country trek .

"(CNN) -- The sounds of battle echo across a desolate stretch of land just east of Bagram Air Base, America's biggest base in Afghanistan. As it turns out, it's just battle practice. ""Training exercises on our big weapons to include our small arms,"" explains Sergeant 1st Class Steve Cunningham, of the 381st Military Police Unit. ""Just put some ammo down range. The Afghan people let us do this to make sure our weapons stay functional for future missions."" He says rehearsals like this help his troops keep their skills sharp, adding that they're skills U.S. troops need to keep Afghans safe. But villagers living around the East River Range couldn't disagree more -- they argue U.S. military exercises here are putting them in danger. ""Kids wander around and touch what they find,"" says Wali Muhammad Kuchi, a nomadic shepherd who is sitting across the road watching soldiers fire volleys of rounds into the mountainside. ""These kids, they don't know what is and isn't full of explosives."" A handful of boys standing around him are waiting for the soldiers to leave. They'll scavenge for left over metal casings and fragments to sell for much needed cash for their families. One boy tells us one kilogram, or about 2.2 pounds, of scrap metal will earn him roughly 150 Afghanis, or $3. Wali Muhammad lost a leg and an arm to Soviet landmines in the 1980s, and he worries for the safety of his 13 year-old son, Esakhil -- one of the boys who will soon be out in the range searching for metal. According to Mohammed Sediq Rashid, Chief of Operations of the Mine Action Coordination Centre of Afghanistan (or MACCA), at least 12 civilians from villages surrounding the range area have been maimed by unexploded ordnance, or UXOs, in the last four years. At least one was killed. The shepherds are also at risk. They graze their sheep on slopes littered with bullets, grenades, and in a recent case, an anti-aircraft rocket, according to the U.S. military. In a frayed cloth tent next to the range, we find 17 year-old Abdul Rahman. He winces from pain as he tells us how he lost part of his left arm. ""We are nomads. We take our herds to the mountain site for feeding. I saw something there,"" describes Abdul Rahman. ""When I picked it up and then hit it with a stone it exploded."" His father, Zayar Gul, recounts how he rushed his son to nearby Bagram Air Base for emergency treatment. He says they were turned away by local guards at the gate. A U.S. military official at the base said he wasn't aware of the case. Abdul Rahman was eventually taken to the Kabul Emergency Surgical Center, and then transferred to an eye hospital to save his sight. Four weeks after the explosion, he's still wearing sunglasses to protect his injured eyes. The 17-year-old also lost part of his other arm in a similar explosion several years ago. He believes that in both incidents he was hurt by unexploded U.S. ordnance. As Gul describes what happened to his son, his anger grows. ""It wasn't just something thrown from the sky. If it wasn't for the Americans doing their military exercises here, why would my son have been blown up?"" Gul's leg was severed by a Soviet era landmine, but he says it's U.S. forces who are now sowing destruction. ""We can't do any other kind of work,"" says Gul, ""We don't have houses and we can't go to the cities. But they, the Americans, have made this place like fire for us."" All along the 20 kilometer (12.4 mile) stretch of flat terrain at East River Range is wide open land, with very little to indicate there's any danger. Fencing is nonexistent, and the few signs there warning that this area is a firing range are in faded English. For a largely illiterate population that speaks mostly Dari and Pashto, it's almost impossible for them to understand their lives are at risk. Three decades of successive wars made Afghanistan one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. But now, UXOs account for three times as many casualties as mines -- and most of them are children, according to MACCA. United Nations estimates that roughly 10 million landmines still remain in Afghanistan. Most of them are Soviet made, the deadly legacy left over from Afghanistan's war with that country. But these days, Mohammad Sediq Rashid, MACCA's Chief of Operations says U.S. forces need to fully recognize their responsibility -- and that to a degree, they have failed in their duty to protect Afghan civilians. ""They should do something to make sure that the civilians are protected after the war is finished or after the training is finished,"" says Rashid. Bagram's Deputy Garrison Commander, Michael Hartman, is in charge of the range. He acknowledges the U.S. military needs to do more at various sites throughout the country, and says he empathizes with the local population. ""I'm a grandfather and I'm hearing these stories of kids out there getting injured,"" he says. ""I have seven grandkids. My oldest is 13, my youngest is seven. So, in addition to being a concerned grandparent, I know how I'd feel if my kids got injured. I think we have to do a better job of marking."" To that end, he says the military plans to soon place big concrete blocks about 200 meters apart on the flat terrain part of the range -- and intends to mark them with the international symbols that indicate a minefield. ""We think using those markings, red on one side, white on the other, is something they'll recognize,"" Hartman explains. ""The second part of that would be to have a warning or safety warnings,"" adds Hartman, ""'unexploded ordnance or impact area' -- written in there in three languages -- English, Pashto and Dari -- because that's the languages that are understood here."" He adds that people in the area know it's a firing range, ""but usually economics drive them to go out there and scavenge metals."" As members of the 381st Military Police Unit finish up their exercises, they pick up spent shell casings from the road. Cunningham says his unit does the right thing. ""I'd say that we're really big on picking up the metal that we lay down,"" he explains. ""We pick up the trash and we pick up after ourselves. We brought it with us, we're taking it back with us."" Still, these troops won't venture far beyond the road because they know there are decades worth of explosive remnants of war out there. But Wali Muhamad has other worries. ""The remains from the foot solders aren't that dangerous,"" he says, ""it's the things that are dropped first from the helicopters -- those things are very dangerous and lots of people have lost body parts because of that."" The range is used to test fire everything from 40mm grenades to 2.75-inch rockets fired by helicopters, all the way up to Hellfire missiles, says Hartman. 20mm rounds are fired off A-10 jets, and 30mm rounds are fired off the Apache helicopters. We asked what posed the greatest risk to civilians in the area. Hartman said that while he's not an explosive ordnance disposal expert, it's ""usually the 40mm rounds, 40mm grenades that are usually fired with a shoulder, a rifle, Mark 19, or some other weapons system."" Casualty reports from East River Range started coming in to MACCA in 2008. Rashid says it's been tough to communicate with the Americans. Ahead of the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, he's worried about UXOs that will be left behind by coalition forces. ""We need to know the possible location of unexploded ordnance,"" says a somewhat frustrated Rashid. ""We need to know the possible areas that are affected by improvised explosive devices. We need to have information ... before the international community forces leave -- they should pass it on to us so that the mine action program of Afghanistan is aware of these problems and able to address those legacies of the war in the years to come."" The U.S. military says it is aware of the dangers. ""We're at war,"" explains Hartman, ""and you know, war is an inherently dangerous business. And we try to mitigate that danger by consolidating those routine, so to speak, firing and expenditure of weapon munitions into a controlled area as best we can."" Hartman, who arrived in Afghanistan in February, says he's not sure exactly what will be done to clean up UXOs from the East River Range, but says a concerted effort is now being made to minimize future casualties. But for Abdul Rahman and others living close to the range, it's too late. They say this is their land, and they have nowhere else to go.","Unexploded ordnance left on one range in Afghanistan killed 12 civilians in last four years .

"(CNN) -- Around 4:30 a.m. the first beams of summer sunlight finish crossing the Bay of Fundy and arrive at West Quoddy Head in Lubec, Maine, the easternmost point of the continental United States. It takes about seven minutes for the same rays to travel about 65 miles as the crow flies down the rocky coast and start flickering on Mount Desert Island's pink granite at Acadia National Park. Visitors have to be dedicated to make it out in time to see the early sunrise at Acadia, says park ranger Charlie Jacobi. But it's worth it. The new day's light slowly envelops the landscape, creating a kaleidoscope of colors that is perfectly reminiscent of a desert Southwest sunset. ""The first five to 10 minutes of the sun coming up, that granite is just phenomenal,"" he says. ""It'll blow from pink to gold."" The Wabanaki people lived on Maine's coast for 5,000 years prior to the arrival of Europeans sometime during in the 16th century. Originally colonized by the French, the federal government established it as Lafayette National Park in 1919. Katmai: See Alaska's brown bears . The park was renamed Acadia in 1929 and kept alive during the Depression through the help of the Civilian Conservation Corps. Today, it is celebrated as the first national park east of the Mississippi and is the easternmost National Park in the continental United States. Park stats: Nearly 2.5 million people visited Acadia National Park last year, making it the ninth most-visited national park. The location: Acadia National Park encompasses more than 47,000 acres starting on the Schoodic Peninsula south of Maine State Route 186 and spreading out over parts of 19 islands. Only five of the islands have public access -- Mount Desert Island, Isle au Haut, Bar Island, Baker Island and Little Cranberry Island, which is home to the one-acre Isleford Historical Museum. The other 14 islands can be observed by boat tours. Many of them are unsafe for landing or are reserved for nesting birds. Many islands have private land and park rangers request visitors respect those boundaries. Click here to view a park map and ways to access islands. The park is about an hour's drive from Bangor and a five-hour drive from Boston. Flights are available to Bangor International Airport and from Boston to Hancock County-Bar Airport, about 10 miles from the park. Dig in: Top sand sculpture events .

Isle Royale: An isolated paradise . Meet our ranger: Charlie Jacobi is the natural resource and visitor use specialist at Acadia. He was born and raised in Connecticut, but wasn't exposed to nature until a post-college summer road trip with friends to 16 national parks. ""It wasn't like my family was a gigantic group of hiking and outdoors people,"" says Jacobi, 59. Jacobi developed an interest in hiking and canoeing and worked as an outfitter and guide before entering grad school at Virginia Tech. After graduation, he worked seven years as a seasonal employee for the park service before getting a full-time gig at Acadia in 1984. He has been in his current position since 1992. Acadia still lives up to the reason it was made a national park -- spectacular beauty made up of diverse geographical vistas and wildlife habitats, he says. ""Acadia is a day hiker's paradise. The trails meander and amble seemingly aimlessly, constantly changing directions. You could spend a lifetime exploring."" For a day trip, don't miss: Park Loop Road's 27-mile drive. The loop starts at the Hulls Cove Visitor Center on Mount Desert Island. It will take you past Acadia's major sites: Thunder Hole, Sand Beach, Jordan Pond and Cadillac Mountain. Portions of Park Loop Road close every year from December 1 through April 15. Favorite less-traveled spot: A series of trails that complete a 4.5- to 5-mile loop that connects Penobscot Mountain and Sargent Mountain. Start at the Jordan Pond House and take Spring Trail to Jordan Cliffs Trail to the Sargent East Cliffs Trail to the Sargent South Ridge Trail to the Penobscot Mountain Trail, which will reconnect with Spring Trail. Sargent Mountain is Acadia's second tallest peak and the hike offers panoramic views of granite domes on mountains to the east, Jacobi says. ""I find myself going there a lot,"" he says. ""If you pick your times and days, you can avoid the crowd."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: Sieur de Monts Spring and Isle au Haut. While the park is home to deer, otters, bald eagles, coyotes, lynx, foxes and fisher, Jacobi says Acadia is really a bird-watcher's paradise. He recommends Sieur de Monts Spring for listening to singing birds, and Isle au Haut for watching migrating flocks in the fall. Most magical moment in the park: the dozen times each spring when a combination of heavy rain and snow-melt create unseen waterfalls. Jacobi discovered this in 1988 while hiking with a friend during a storm. ""It's another little secret,"" he says."" There are a dozen waterfalls at Tarn after a heavy rain. It only lasts a couple of hours but it's really neat."" Oddest moment at the park: Watching a helicopter take off from a yacht in Bar Harbor and land on top of different Acadia mountains so the owner could pick blueberries. While Acadia's blueberries are fair game to all, landing a helicopter on national park land isn't. ""They didn't bother to give him a ticket,"" he says. ""You can pick them (blueberries) for personal consumption,"" A ranger's request: Always keep your dog on a leash. Click here for a list of Acadia's pet-restricted areas. ""It not only protects wildlife, but it also protects your dog from getting porcupined,"" he says. Another park he'd like to visit: Chiricahua National Monument in Cochise County, Arizona. Tucked along Arizona's southeastern border with New Mexico, the Chiricahua Mountains were a stronghold during the 19th century for Apache tribes who were wedged between the U.S. Army in the north and east and Mexico to the south. Parts of the park flood every year during summer monsoons and the best times to visit are in the fall or spring. ""I went there once and found it to be positively charming,"" says Jacobi. ""I thought the trails were wonderful."" What national park would you like to visit?

"(CNN) -- Firefighters determined to snuff out a wildfire that killed 19 of their colleagues scoured the scorched earth near Prescott, Arizona, on Wednesday, searching for smoldering vegetation that could reignite and further spread the deadly Yarnell Hill blaze. The nearly 600 firefighters and support workers assigned to the fire paused only to observe a moment of silence in honor of the 19 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, who died Sunday when the fire took a sudden unexpected turn. Lookout warned team before fire killed 19 . How to help the families . The pause coincided with the movement of a convoy of vehicles driven to the fire by the Granite Mountain team. The vehicles are being returned to Prescott, where they were based. To start the moment of silence, a loud alert tone sounded on firefighters' radios and an unidentified fire team commander announced, ""As the crew carriers for the Granite Mountain hot shots leaves the Yarnell Hills fire and begin their journey home, all personnel in the incident will observe an operational pause, in observance of our fallen comrades."" Wildfire crews across the country were being encouraged to observe a similar pause sometime Wednesday, incident command spokesman Jim Whittington said. ""It makes this fire much different from the other fires we fight, and I think people really want to put this thing to bed and get rid of it,"" he said. Wittington said he expected good progress on the fire and no further loss of life, but he said smoldering vegetation driven under and, in some cases, into crevices of rocks could quickly reignite under the right conditions and cause a sudden flare-up. The fire was offically listed as 45% contained late Wednesday. The possibility of thunderstorms Thursday afternoon offered little promise of putting out the fire, Whittington said. Not only is much of the wood and grass that the fire could burn sheltered from the rain by boulders and other terrain features, thunderstorms bring the possibility of lighting and high winds that could spread the flames, he said. With so much of the work focused on ground work, four U.S. Air Force C-130s brought in Tuesday from firefighting duties in Colorado will likely not be needed to fight the fire Wednesday, Whittington said. The aircraft, normally stationed in Colorado and California, are equipped with special firefighting gear that can dump 3,000 gallons of fire retardant in less than five seconds. Remembering those who were killed . Families who were forced to evacuate because of the fire could be allowed back on their property by Saturday, Whittington said. Earlier in the week, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office advised residents in the communities of Peeples Valley and Yarnell to evacuate their dwellings. An estimated 200 homes and other structures have burned in Yarnell. But first, fire crews have to ensure that no embers are still burning near the homes and that the areas are safe for people to permanently return. Utility crews also must reconnect service, Whittington said. ""There is is still a lot of work to do around the structures,"" he said. Opinion: When heroes face down fire -- and fate .

"Washington (CNN) -- The justices on the Supreme Court know very well their rulings can send immediate political shock waves, and those just intensify in a presidential election year. So there is an unusual internal dynamic at work of what cases the court hears and when. Unlike the other parts of the judiciary, the Supreme Court is a discretionary body. They stingily pick which cases go on the docket and when. In fact, only about 1% of appeals are accepted and fully reviewed. But certain legal fights are so important and time-sensitive, this court of last resort is often powerless to refuse or delay. That is true of the current challenges to the health care reform law, which will be argued Monday through Wednesday. An expected June ruling in an election year will put the court front and center for voters come November. The justices by nature are loathe to get involved in such highly partisan disputes. But sometimes often have no choice. Preview: 'The implications ... are impossible to overstate' The 2000 Bush v. Gore case ultimately settled the fight over counting Florida's ballots, giving George W. Bush the presidency. Several justices have since said they were not eager to decide the matter and place themselves as competing political saviors or demons. Read a transcript of Monday's health-care arguments . Here are some landmark, presidential election-year legal disputes -- judicial blockbusters if you will -- handled by the Supreme Court: . -- 1824 / Gibbons v. Ogden, striking down a New York law granting a monopoly to a Hudson River ferry company. The court under Chief Justice John Marshall clarified the Commerce Clause, concluding state law conflicted with overriding congressional power to regulate interstate commerce. It is interpretation of that clause that is central to the current legal fight over health care expansion. -- 1856 / Dred Scott v. Sandford, declaring Congress could not ban slavery in the territories and that blacks were barred from citizenship. The appeal was argued February 1856, and a ruling came two days after President James Buchanan's inauguration in March 1857. The new president in fact had asked the court to time its decision until after the election but before being sworn into office. He hoped that would defuse the slavery issue by putting it beyond political debate. And like others, the Democrat hoped the court's ruling would carry legitimacy among citizens in the North and South, an ultimately naive view. Two families, two views on health care law . Historians also note the president-elect had quietly persuaded Northern Justice Robert Grier to change his vote and join the Southern majority in the Scott case, to give the impression the decision was not made along regional lines. This ruling is widely viewed as the court's darkest moment, a sentiment expressed by most current members of the high court. -- 1896 / Plessy v. Ferguson, blessing the ""separate but equal"" state doctrine of racial segregation. By an 8 to 1 margin, the court upheld a Louisiana law requiring federal rail cars to provide different facilities for white and black passengers. The justices said that did not violate federal authority over interstate commerce, nor the 13th and 14th amendments. That precedent was overturned dramatically in the 1954 Brown v. Board series of appeals. -- 1908 / Muller v. Oregon, allowing a state law limiting the working hours of women. Attorney for the state Louis Brandeis -- soon to join the court -- successfully argued that long, unregulated hours on the job affected the health and morals of employees, especially those in factories. A landmark decision affirming government control over the workplace. -- 1972 / Furman v. Georgia, invalidating all existing capital punishment laws. The 5-4 court said the death penalty was being applied unconstitutionally. States responded by revising their laws, leading the court four years later, in another presidential election year, to end its moratorium and allow states to resume executions. -- 1972 / Roe v. Wade, legalizing abortion as a fundamental right of a woman's ""privacy"" under the 14th Amendment and concluding a fetus was not a ""person"" with constitutionally protected rights. The court tried to strike a balance between that individual right and states' duty in limited regulation, for the sake of prenatal life and a woman's health, a governmental interest that grows stronger as the pregnancy develops over time. The companion cases first came to the court in 1970, and arguments were scheduled for 1971, then postponed until spring 1972, then reargued October 1972, a month before the presidential elections. The landmark ruling came out January 1973, just days after President Richard Nixon's inauguration. -- 2000 / Bush v. Gore, ruling manual recounts of presidential ballots in Florida could not move ahead because of inconsistent evaluation standards in different counties. The court's conservative majority cited the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution for its reasoning. Stopping the tally meant Republican George W. Bush, who was then narrowly leading in the decisive state, would become president, defeating Vice President Al Gore. -- 2008 / District of Columbia v. Heller, tossing out the District's strict ban on private handgun ownership. The conservative majority said citizens have a basic ""individual"" right to possess and keep guns in the home for self-defense. The court reaffirmed its holding two years later in a challenge to a similarly restrictive law from Chicago. A CNN guide to frequently asked questions . Sometimes the high court itself becomes the story. Here are some presidential election years where the Supreme Court as an institution or the justices became a major campaign issue: . -- 1800: Jeffersonian Republicans aimed criticism at the Federalist-dominated high court over how much power the central government should hold. The tight election race -- called by some the ""Revolution of 1800"" -- ushered in an era of Democratic-Republican party executive rule. New President Thomas Jefferson had campaigned on remaking the federal courts as well, but it was Chief Justice John Marshall, taking office two months before Jefferson, who succeeded on that front. Through his 35-year leadership on the bench, his federalist leanings helped strengthen the power of the U.S. government in the face of state authority. -- 1860: The infamous Dred Scott decision shaped the debate of this election, indirectly helped put Abraham Lincoln in the White House and carried the nation into its seemingly inevitable path to the Civil War. Lincoln had sharply criticized the Scott ruling in his stump speeches, and the new Republican Party's convention platform officially condemned it. -- 1876: The 2000 election was not our first disputed one. In 1876, Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote in the presidential race, with Republican Rutherford B. Hayes also trailing in the initial electoral vote. Republicans protested, and to resolve the dispute, Congress created a bipartisan commission that included five Supreme Court justices. It was Justice Joseph Bradley who proved the swing vote, siding with Hayes and giving the Republican a 185-184 electoral vote win. An insider's guide: How the Supreme Court works . -- 1896: The high court a year earlier had invalidated a nationwide federal income tax. Liberals made that and other decisions considered ""pro-business"" a political rallying point. Democrats campaigned against court ""usurpation"" of congressional reform efforts, a divisive political issue that would carry in into the 1930s. -- 1924: The question here was a proposal by Progressive Party candidate Sen. Robert LaFollete's (who served Wisconsin as a Republican) for a ""one-up"" constitutional amendment. It would give Congress the power to overturn Supreme Court decisions that overturned acts of Congress. Incumbent President Calvin Coolidge defended the federal courts, then dominated by conservative, as protectors of ""our fundamental law."" -- 1936: The fight between the courts and the other branches reached their zenith with the re-election efforts of President Franklin Roosevelt. He charged that the courts were undermining his sweeping economic reform programs during a national emergency, the Depression. FDR was privately maneuvering for ways to go around the judiciary, including his audacious ""court-packing plan"" to expand the number of justices. That would allow the president to immediately name new, presumably more sympathetic, members to the court. The plan unveiled in 1937 ultimately failed, but the Democrat's 12-plus years in office did give him a chance to eventually appoint a record number of justices to that bench. -- 1968: Republican candidate Richard Nixon made the court's 15-year record of ""liberal"" decisions under Chief Justice Earl Warren a big ""law and order"" campaign theme. Nixon said those rulings were ""seriously hamstringing the peace forces in our society and strengthening the criminal forces."" Warren retired a year later, and Nixon eventually named four justices to the high court. The subsequent appointments of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush also helped move the federal judiciary to the right for decades.","Some Supreme Court decisions make a huge election-year splashes .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey's use of F-16 warplanes to force a Syrian airliner to land and be searched on Wednesday demonstrated a blunt warning to Damascus a week after five Turkish civilians were killed by cross-border artillery fire from Syria. On Thursday, a day after the Syrian passenger plane was forced to land at Ankara's airport, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced at a news conference that cargo confiscated from the aircraft included ""items ... traveling from Russia's agency that exports weapons munitions and military supplies to Syria's defense ministry."" Turkish officials said the use of F-16's to intercept the plane as it flew from Moscow to Damascus was a show of force, to illustrate Turkey would not tolerate the use of its airspace for weapons shipments to Syria. ""We wanted to show that we are serious,"" said a Turkish foreign ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ankara delivered a diplomatic note to Damascus denouncing the alleged use of civilian aircraft to carry military equipment, the Turkish diplomat. Turkish officials have still not confirmed exactly what the plane was carrying. Just hours after the plane was forced land, however, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that the passenger plane's cargo violated international civilian aviation regulations. The Syrian Ministry of Information released a statement that said Turkey's claim ""has no truth in it,"" and Erdogan ""needs to show those equipments and ammunition in order to prove that he is truthful at least before his own people."" Turkish officials have still not confirmed exactly what the plane was carrying. Just hours after the plane was forced land, however, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that the passenger plane's cargo violated international civilian aviation regulations. ""This is a matter of principle,"" he said on Turkish broadcaster TGRT. ""We are determined to stem the flow of arms to the regime in Syria which so cruelly kills its own people. It is not acceptable that such a thing can be done by using our airspace."" Turkey previously has intercepted Iranian shipments of arms headed to Syria through Turkish territory and airspace over the past year. In those cases, the government remained similarly silent about the exact nature of those shipments, perhaps to avoid embarrassing Iran, a major Turkish trading partner and neighbor. On Wednesday, Turkey's foreign ministry announced the Syrian plane received a radio message while it was still outside of Turkish airspace, warning that it was suspected of carrying illegal cargo. But the plane's pilot did not turn back, the Turkish statement continued, and F-16 warplanes escorted it until it landed at Ankara Esenboga Airport at 5:15 local time. The Turkish diplomat said cargo boxes addressed to the Syrian Defense Ministry were found on board, inspected and confiscated. ""This is a clear message from Turkey that it will make it hard for Syria to import arms from outside. If the borders and the airspace are being controlled this tightly we can also assume that the sea lanes, the Mediterranean ports might also be kept an eye on by the Turkish navy,"" said Murat Yetkin, editor in chief of the Hurriyet Daily News. Syrian officials accused Turkish security forces of mishandling crew members during the plane's stay in Ankara. Transportation Minister Mahmoud Said went one step further, calling the forced landing a ""Turkish piracy operation."" ""They raided the plane carrying weapons, they handcuffed us, took us out of the plane and threw us at the ground,"" crew member Heitham Kassir told Syrian state TV, showing bruises on an arm. Russian officials also expressed concern over the treatment of the Russian nationals, and alleged that embassy officials were not given information about the situation. According to a Russian Foreign Ministry statement, Russian diplomats and doctors dispatched to the airport in Ankara were denied access to the 17 Russians among the 35 passengers. Turkey's foreign ministry responded in a statement Thursday, claiming Turkish authorities learned there were Russians on board the plane only shortly before it was allowed to take off and that Russian Embassy officials were then apprised of the situation. ""All the necessary precautions were taken to ensure the safety of the passengers,"" said the Turkish statement. Analysts say one of the reasons Ankara has not been forthcoming with what was found on the plane -- although there were initial Turkish media reports that the shipment may have contained missile parts or military-grade communication equipment -- is that neither Turkey nor Russia is looking to weaken their strong bilateral trade relations. ""The Turkish and Russians have agreed to disagree on the Syrian issue and seem to have reached the conclusion that Syrian affairs should not effect Turkish-Russian relations,"" Hurriyet Daily editor Yetkin said. The Russian ambassador to Turkey was invited to meetings at the Turkish Foreign Ministry discuss the issue, a Turkish government spokesman told CNN. Once-strong social and trade relations between Turkey and Syria have grown tense over the past year after the Syrian government began a bloody crackdown on anti-government protestors. Ankara backs the anti-government rebels and has called on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down. More recently, the neighboring countries exchanged artillery fire following the death of five civilians killed by a Syrian shell that fell into a Turkish border village. Cave becomes classroom for Syrian kids . Other developments in Syria: . An explosion occurred near the Syrian Ministry of Education, according to state-run TV network SANA. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group, said the explosive was aimed at a military judiciary headquarters. There were no initial reports of casualties. At least 210 people were killed by Syrian security forces across the country Thursday, including 47 in Idlib, according to the Local Coordination Committees for Syria, a network of opposition activists. CNN can't confirm reports of violence or casualty counts as access to the country by international journalists has been severely restricted. For a third day, al-Assad's forces shelled the city of Homs in western Syria early Thursday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Government troops and rebels have battled on and off for control of the city since the start of the conflict. Twenty people were found dead in Homs on Wednesday, the LCC reported. North of Homs, in the city of Saraqib, rebels tried to take over government-held positions. Three rebels and a number of government soldiers were killed, the Syrian Observatory said. Fighting between rebels and regime forces continued in and around the town of Maaret al-Numan in Idlib province, said Abu Abdul Rahaman, who works with an opposition network that documents what the rebels are doing. He spoke to CNN via Skype. The town is strategically important because it's on an international highway that the government uses to send supplies to Damascus, Idlib, Hama, Homs and Aleppo. Opinion: Syria conflict threatens regional stability . U.S. observers to Jordan . The United States deployed troops to Jordan to help monitor Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons and determine what efforts to take if violence spreads to neighboring nations, the U.S. defense chief said. The announcement follows recent news that al-Assad's forces moved some of the weapons for security reasons. Reports have emerged that rebels are focusing their efforts on capturing some of the storage sites. ""We continue to be concerned about security at those sites,"" U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said Wednesday after a meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels, Belgium. ""We want to ensure that security is maintained and we want to be very sure that those (weapons) do not fall into the wrong hands."" Roughly 150 U.S. Army special operations soldiers have been working with Jordanian forces to monitor the chemical and biological weapons sites in Syria while trying to determine how to respond should an issue arise, according to the defense chief. CNN reported in June that U.S. Special Operations Forces were training and advising Jordanian troops on a range of specific military tasks they might need to undertake if unrest in Syria spills into Jordan or poses a threat to that country. That information came from Defense Department officials who did not want to be named. Panetta now has publicly acknowledged the troop deployment. ""We have a group of our forces there, working to help them build a headquarters and to ensure that we make the relationship between the United States and Jordan a strong one so we can deal with all of the possible consequences,"" he said. A senior Jordanian military official denied Panetta's claims, according to the state-run Petra news agency. The American troops are in the country for an annual training exercise, the official from the Jordanian armed forces general command told the news agency. The United States also has been working with Turkey as part of its effort to monitor the weapons sites. Syria is believed to have one of the ""largest and most advanced chemical warfare"" programs in the Arab world, said Michael Eisenstadt, director of the military and security studies program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

"(CNN) -- Forces loyal to Ivory Coast's former leader, Laurent Gbagbo, used a lull in fighting this week as a ""trick"" to reinforce their positions around the main city of Abidjan, the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations said Friday. Though Gbagbo's men said Tuesday they wanted a peaceful solution to the months-long fighting in Ivory Coast, they soon restarted shelling both the U.N. headquarters and the civilian population, Alain Le Roy told reporters at the United Nations. Forces loyal to Gbagbo have since regained control of two central areas of Abidjan and fighting is continuing, Le Roy said, after briefing the U.N. Security Council on developments in the cocoa-producing nation. ""They have clearly used the lull of Tuesday as a trick to reinforce their position,"" he said. Most areas of the capital, however, are now under U.N. or French military control, journalist Seyi Rhodes reported from the French military base in Port Bouet. The French military has been working to reconnect the disrupted water and electricity supply in what is the country's main city. Rhodes traveled with the French military through Abidjan on Friday and reported seeing civilians in the streets, including one woman selling food, which he took as a positive sign. There appeared to be a standoff, however, outside Abidjan's Golf Hotel, where Gbagbo's rival and the internationally recognized president, Alassane Ouattara, is staying under U.N. protection, Rhodes reported. He said Gbagbo's forces are outside the hotel. Le Roy said that if that hotel comes under attack, the United Nations may have to consider using force against Gbagbo and his men. Pro-Gbagbo forces have heavy weapons including tanks, mortars, and rocket-propelled grenades and are using them ""as we speak against the civilian population"" and U.N. headquarters, Le Roy said. ""Those who are saying there are no more heavy weapons -- that Mr. Gbagbo has no more heavy weapons -- it's a lie,"" he said. Earlier, French military sources said the French ambassador's residence in Abidjan came under attack by forces loyal to Gbagbo, but a Gbagbo spokesman said that was ""impossible"" because U.N. forces are surrounding all the ambassadors' residences. The spokesman, Ahoua Don Mello, said the U.N. forces fired on the state television station, which is in the same block as both the French ambassador's residence and Gbagbo's residence, and that they have broken the antennae. ""The national TV station was destroyed by the last attack (two days ago),"" Mello said. ""Right now it is still working, and the French don't want the national TV to work any more and they are now preparing an attack."" Le Roy said 23 countries have requested U.N. help in moving their personnel to safer areas of Abidjan. Those countries include India, China, South Africa, the United States, Israel, Mali, and Niger. U.N. forces also offered to relocate the 35 journalists who were at the Novotel hotel in Abidjan, he said. Many accepted the offer but some have stayed behind. The United Nations is still hoping political dialogue will resolve the situation, said Nestor Osorio, Colombia's ambassador and current president of the U.N. Security Council. ""We hope that additional political actions will be taken, but still the great difficulty here is the absolute reluctance of Mr. Gbagbo to recognize the legitimacy of Mr. Ouattara,"" Osorio said Friday. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed his nation's full support of Ouattara on Friday and said the situation in the country ""remains serious."" ""The militia paid by Gbagbo continues abuses, looting, and assassinations,"" he said. ""The population lives in very precarious conditions. Massive humanitarian aid will be needed pending the reconstruction."" Juppe's words came amid a disturbing new report of the type of killings and abuses that have plagued Ivory Coast since the disputed November election. More than 100 bodies were recovered in the past 24 hours in western Ivory Coast, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Office said Friday. Human rights teams found 15 more bodies in Duekoue, the cocoa-rich town where last week several agencies reported a massacre of as many as 800 people. The U.N. rights agency said that so far, 244 bodies have been recovered from that incident, the bloodiest episode yet. The victims are believed to have been mostly or all Guerre people, who have traditionally supported Gbagbo, and some of the victims were burned alive, the United Nations said. In the town of Blolequin, human rights investigators said, the perpetrators of killings were Liberian mercenaries who separated the Guerre from the rest and spared them from slaughter. Le Roy said a commission of inquiry will be appointed soon to investigate the killings. A report by Human Rights Watch, released late Friday, backed up the U.N. claims. It said forces loyal to both Ouattara and Gbagbo are responsible for ""serious abuses"" including the killing and rape of those believed to support the other side. The report pinned most of the blame, however, on supporters of the internationally recognized president. ""People interviewed by Human Rights Watch described how, in village after village, pro-Ouattara forces ... summarily executed and raped perceived Gbagbo supporters in their homes, as they worked in the fields, as they fled, or as they tried to hide in the bush,"" the human rights group said. ""The fighters often targeted people by ethnicity, and the attacks disproportionally affected those too old or feeble to flee."" The group urged Ouattara to open an investigation into abuses by both sides as soon as he takes power. ""While the international community has been focused on the political stalemate in Abidjan over the presidency, forces on both sides have committed numerous atrocities against civilians, their leaders showing little interest in reining them in,"" said Daniel Bekele, Africa director for Human Rights Watch. ""Ouattara should send a strong message to (his forces) that such abuses will be fully punished at home or by an international tribunal."" Nearly 150,000 people have now fled their homes amid Ivory Coast's war, displaced within the country or seeking refuge in neighboring nations, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday. Refugees said they were tired, hungry and exhausted after arriving in Liberia's Maryland County, which is along the border at the Atlantic coast. Some arrived by foot, others by canoe. Some reported seeing dead bodies along the way. Sporadic gunfire rang out Friday in Abidjan, the nation's largest city, where Gbagbo remained hunkered down in the basement of his residence, guarded by about 200 of his men. Despite being surrounded by Ouattara's troops and receiving a warning from the U.N. secretary-general that he should seize his last chance for a graceful exit, Gbagbo showed no willingness to budge. Ouattara has blamed Gbagbo for Ivory Coast's suffering. He told citizens this week he ordered the military and police to safeguard public places including hospitals and markets. The November presidential election had been expected to help unify the West African nation, which is rebounding from a 2002 civil war. Instead, the disputed vote sliced the nation in two. Sporadic post-election violence erupted into all-out war after Ouattara's troops launched an offensive that swept through the country to Abidjan on the coast. On Friday, at Ouattara's request, the European Union lifted sanctions on Ivory Coast entities, including two key ports. ""Under the measures adopted today, the ports of Abidjan and San Pedro, the Ivorian Refining Company and the Coffee and Cocoa Trade Management Committee are removed from the list of entities subject to the EU assets freeze,"" an EU statement read. CNN's Moni Basu, Katy Byron, Saskya Vandoorne, and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","NEW: Human Rights Watch blames both sides for ""serious abuses""

"Ankara, Turkey (CNN) -- A day after conflicting accounts over the death of a protester sparked clashes between security forces and demonstrators in several Turkish cities, Turkey's interior minister insisted police played no role in the man's fatal injuries. ""What happened in Hatay is a saddening event. I wish peace from God for our deceased citizen,"" Muammer Guler told journalists. He was referring to Ahmet Atakan, 22, who died as a result of his injuries amid a predawn battle between demonstrators and riot police in the Turkish border province of Hatay on Tuesday. ""The investigation into the event was started immediately. However, as you also watched yesterday, footage emerged that shows there was no police intervention and that (he) fell from a high place. This is what the autopsy report says as well,"" Guler said. Turkish authorities in the province of Hatay have not responded to CNN requests to share Atakan's official autopsy report. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses and family members of the dead protester have insisted that Atakan did not fall from a building. Rather, they told CNN, he was shot in the head at close range by a tear gas canister fired by a passing police armored personnel carrier. Since a wave of protests erupted over government plans to replace a park in Istanbul with a shopping mall last May, human rights groups have documented cases of a number of activists who were blinded, suffered brain damage, or remain in medically induced comas a result of tear gas canisters fired at their heads. But Turkish government officials have pointed to two videos to bolster the case that Atakan fell to his death Tuesday morning. One video from a camera aboard a police vehicle showed debris apparently being hurled from rooftops at the vehicle as it drove up Hatay's Gunduz Street. For months, the area has been the site of nearly weekly clashes between demonstrators from Turkey's Alawite religious minority and Turkish security forces. At one moment in the video, the body of a man tumbles off of a dark curb onto the street, apparently forcing the police vehicle to swerve. Later Tuesday, a second grainy video emerged on Turkish television that showed something that could have been a human body falling down the side of a building as police armored vehicles navigated Gunduz Street. It is not clear whether the interior minister's statements or the two videos will persuade many critics of the Turkish government. At a funeral in Hatay on Tuesday, angry relatives, friends and neighbors chanted ""murderer police"" as they carried Atakan's casket to a freshly dug grave. ""Erdogan's dogs killed my son,"" screamed Atakan's mother Emsal, in an interview with CNN. She was referring to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's prime minister. Atakan is the second man from his neighborhood -- and from the city of Hatay's Alawite community -- to have died amid clashes with police. ""How he died doesn't concern me, it's just a detail,"" said Hasan Akgol, a member of parliament from the opposition Republican People's Party in Hatay. ""The big picture is he died during a police intervention,"" he added in an interview with CNN. ""How many more young kids are going to be killed by this kind of stuff?"" At least four other anti-government demonstrators -- all from Turkey's Alawite and Alevi religious minorities -- have also died as a result of injuries received amid the anti-government unrest that has ebbed and waned across Turkey throughout the summer. ""No matter what happened, we know that there are ethnic-based provocations in Hatay,"" Interior Minister Guler told journalists Wednesday. Tear gas wafted through downtown Hatay late Tuesday night, after angry residents emerged from Atakan's funeral to again clash with Turkish riot police on Gunduz Street. And on Tuesday night, Turkish riot police fired water cannons, plastic pellets and tear gas in Hatay province -- and in the cities of Ankara, Izmir and Istanbul -- to disperse angry protests that erupted in response to Atakan's death.","Ahmet Atakan died from injuries amid anti-government protests in Hatay province Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The bogeyman of judicial activism is back in the news. We owe the latest round of charges to the chorus of commentators, activists and politicians — now led by President Obama himself — fearful that the U.S. Supreme Court will upend part or all of his signature health care law. Like most accusations of activism against the courts, these pre-emptive attacks shed no real light on the constitutional questions at stake. Indeed, it is time to admit how useless — or worse — the epithet of judicial activism is. Echoing other critics, Obama claimed that a ruling against the Affordable Care Act would be ""unprecedented and extraordinary"" and complained that ""an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law."" Let's assume the president did not actually mean to imply that no properly enacted law could ever legitimately be found unconstitutional. Instead, let's examine the broader picture those decrying activism mean to paint: one of an imperial judiciary routinely snatching important policy decisions out of the hands of elected representatives. That picture is false. A 2011 Institute for Justice study, ""Government Unchecked: The False Problem of 'Judicial Activism' and the Need for Judicial Engagement,"" compared the number of laws struck down by the Supreme Court to the number of laws passed by Congress and state legislatures. From 1954 to 2002, the court struck down, in whole or in part, just two-thirds of one percent of laws passed by Congress and less than one-twentieth of a percent of laws passed by state legislatures. Over those five decades, the court struck, on average, just two federal and nine state laws per year. Toobin: Court's Obama order a 'hissy fit' These tiny numbers and percentages of laws struck are generally consistent over time — including into the Roberts Court era, as a different data set with more recent rulings shows. In the balance of power between the elected and judicial branches, the scales tip heavily toward Congress and state legislatures. Nothing the court might do in the health care case will change that. By the numbers, charges of rampant judicial activism are wildly overblown. Worse, they typically serve as a partisan club intended to foreclose healthy debate on constitutional questions. Obama attempted to hoist conservatives — for years, advocates of judicial ""restraint"" and ""minimalism"" — with their own petard. But this game of gotcha just shows how ""judicial activism"" has become code for ""decisions I don't like."" Both sides play the activism card and demand deference to democratic outcomes, when they like them. Claims of judicial activism have become a substitute for serious thought about the constitutionality of legislative and executive actions,and one that leads to ever-expanding government power. That's the true meaning of ""deference."" But in our system of government, courts are meant to be ""bulwarks"" of liberty, not rubber stamps for government power. Obama gave the game away when he attempted to walk back his initial comments by pointing out that, since the days of the New Deal, the Supreme Court has rarely, if ever, struck down economic legislation. Video: Aide: Obama knows the law . That is precisely the problem. As the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals observed in striking down the individual mandate, when Congress exceeds the outer bounds of its authority, ""the Constitution requires judicial engagement, not judicial abdication."" It is no accident that President Obama and other supporters of the health care law are jumping on the judicial activism bandwagon now. But years of judicial abdication in the economic realm should not justify more. If the Supreme Court strikes down part or all of the Affordable Care Act, it will not do much to upset the balance of power between the judicial and elected branches. It might, however, be a small but important step toward jettisoning years of misguided restraint and once again taking constitutional limits on government power seriously. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Knepper.","Lisa Knepper: Judicial activism charges raised by many over health care and Supreme Court .
She says Obama, others warn ruling against health care act would overturn duly passed law .
She says her firm's study found such ""activism"" doesn't exist. Few laws felled by court .

"(CNN) -- A Brazilian court has ordered an immediate halt to construction of a controversial hydroelectric dam project in the Amazon. It's the latest twist in a long-brewing battle between the Brazilian government and local indigenous communities over the Belo Monte dam. The government has backed the construction of what would be the world's third-largest hydroelectric dam, while activists argue that it would displace thousands of local residents and damage the environment. In the most recent ruling, announced by Regional Federal Judge Souza Prudente to reporters, construction is ordered suspended until indigenous communities get a say on the matter before congress, court spokesman Jair Cardoso said. Injunctions blocking construction have been issued in the past, but the government has successfully overturned them. Congress approved the Belo Monte dam in 2005 and construction started in 2010 when then-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva signed a $17 billion contract with Norte Energia, the consortium chosen to build the dam. But lawmakers erred in not seeking input from the indigenous communities beforehand, the judge ruled. ""The legislation requires consultation (by indigenous communities) prior to a decision by congress (on construction of the dam), and what we have is an attempt after the fact,"" Prudente told the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency. ""Congress made a mockery and acted as if it were in a dictatorship, putting the cart before the horse."" Norte Energia had not received notification of the ruling as of Wednesday, and would not comment for the time being, spokeswoman Sarah Barros said. The company will be fined $250,000 daily if it does not comply. If and when it is completed, Belo Monte will be the third-largest dam in the world, after the Three Gorges dam in China and the Itaipu dam on the Brazil/Paraguay border. The dam, being built on the Xingu River, a tributary of the Amazon, will produce 11,000 megawatts and provide electricity for 23 million homes. According to Norte Energia, after environmental considerations the area to be flooded by the dam was reduced to 516 sq. km (200 sq. miles). Estimates of the number of people who will be displaced by the construction of the dam range from 19,000 to 40,000. The judge also found fault with a previous regional federal court decision that assumed that the country's supreme court had upheld the constitutionality of the legislation behind the dam construction, according to Agencia Brasil. The decision in question had been the opinion of a single judge. For matters of constitutionality, two-thirds of the high court judges would have to agree.","The Belo Monte dam is a controversial project on the Xingu River .
A judge ordered a stop to construction .
The work cannot resume until indigenous communities weigh in on the project ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. intelligence agencies believe Osama bin Laden is isolated from al Qaeda and spending much of his energy merely surviving, the head of the CIA said on Thursday. Osama bin Laden remains on the run despite a $25 million reward for his capture. CIA Director Michael Hayden said hunting down bin Laden remains his agency's priority. ""He is putting a lot of energy into his own survival -- a lot of energy into his own security,"" Hayden said in a speech at the Atlantic Council in Washington. ""In fact, he appears to be largely isolated from the day-to-day operations of the organization he nominally heads,"" he said. In recent weeks, there have been several U.S. missile strikes by unmanned drones around the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The United States maintains that Taliban and al Qaeda forces operate with relative impunity in tribal areas along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan and use those areas as staging grounds to attack U.S. forces and their allies inside Afghanistan. Hayden said al Qaeda has been hurt by a sustained fight with the United States and its allies, but remains a threat. ""Al Qaeda has suffered serious setbacks, but it remains a determined, adaptive enemy unlike any our nation has ever faced,"" Hayden said. ""The war is far from over."" Regardless of whether bin Laden is actively helping lead the terrorist organization, the CIA believes capturing or killing him would be a huge blow to al Qaeda, according to Hayden. ""This is an organization that has never been through a change at the top,"" he said. ""For 20 years, bin Laden has been the visionary, the inspiration or harmonizing force behind al Qaeda."" Hayden said it remained to be seen whether bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, could maintain unity in the ranks without him. ""The truth is, we simply don't know what would happen if bin Laden is killed or captured. But I'm willing to bet that whatever happens, it would work in our favor,"" Hayden said.","Bin Laden isolated from al Qaeda's daily operations, Michael Hayden says .

"(CNN) -- Champion elect Sebastian Vettel recorded the fastest time in practice Friday for the Japanese Grand Prix during an afternoon session overshadowed by the news of the death of Maria de Villota. Red Bull's Vettel will win his fourth straight world title Sunday if he wins at Suzuka and nearest rival Fernando Alonso finishes outside the top eight. Vettel showed his car's pace with a one minute 33.852 clocking in hot conditions, with teammate Mark Webber of Australia second fastest. But the thoughts of the drivers were with De Villota, a reserve driver for Marussia until a horror crash in testing a year ago curtailed her F1 ambitions. Alonso struggled to 10th best after a spin in his Ferrari, but then paid tribute to his fellow Spaniard De Villota. ""I still can't believe it and need a while to stop and think about it,"" he told the official F1 website. ""Of course, it's very sad news for the world of motorsport as Maria was loved by everyone. Now, all we can do is pray for her and for her family."" Jenson Button, ninth best for McLaren spoke for many: ""Today's news about Maria de Villota is horrendous and tragic. ""This is a real shock to the whole Formula One 'family' and the world of motorsport. My thoughts are with her family at this time."" Vettel, who has won the last four Grand Prix races to open up 77 point lead over Alonso, cautioned against placing too much emphasis on Friday practice. ""It's good to see we are up there today, but it's not always so important,"" the German said. ""We need to step up our game for tomorrow, as Mercedes will be strong in qualifying."" Nico Rosberg in a Mercedes was the closest challenger to the Red Bulls with the third fastest time with teammate Lewis Hamilton back in sixth. Hamilton had been quickest in morning practice ahead of Rosberg. Separating them in the afternoon were the Lotus duo of Kimi Raikkenen and Romain Grosjean, with the former also ending in the gravel after a spin on Turn 7 of a testing circuit. Saturday will see the third practice session ahead of final qualifying. If results go Vettel's way, he will emulate the feat of fellow German Michael Schumacher and Argentina legend Juan Manuel Fangio in claiming four straight F1 crowns.","Sebastian Vettel fastest in practice for Japan GP .

"(CNN) -- Scott Simon, for lack of a better phrase, was live-tweeting his mother's final days. In carefully worded posts, Simon, who has spent years artfully telling stories as host of ""Weekend Edition Saturday"" on National Public Radio, shared these most intimate moments with strangers and friends alike. On Twitter, his million-plus followers are generally treated to news updates intermingled with the detailed movements of his and his family's lives. Simon is something of an open book; photos of him as a child on Santa's lap and of his parents and his children fill his website. When Simon and his wife adopted their daughter in 2004, he shared it with the world in a recorded essay for NPR. His instantly recognizable voice describes how he and his wife held their daughter in their laps as they sat in a hotel overlooking China's Pearl River. ""My wife and I were happy before we met our child, but now we feel we're just beginning to grasp the hugeness of happiness that's possible,"" he said. Coming to terms with the death of his mother, Patricia Lyons Simon, seems another kind of hugeness, if only as seen through his updates. Lyons Simon died early Monday evening. Secrets spilled in life's final minutes . On July 19, he mentions her a couple of times but also posts a smiling photo of himself and family out at dinner. Fast forward to July 26, and his updates are posted almost exclusively from inside the hospital's walls -- observations of his mother's behaviors and his attempts at negotiating the tight-knit hospital community. By Sunday, the only updates are tender descriptions of their interactions. The lens focuses on just the two of them, and Monday we are given access to the final goodbye between a mother and her son. A few comments left on the New York Magazine website under a story about Simon's updates before he confirmed his mother's death, were critical. ""Everyone suffers loss. Everyone,"" wrote commenter MIHAIBRESTYAN. ""That's no excuse for begging for attention and acting pathetic."" ""What's with the tweet when he said he was holding his mother's hand,"" commenter BARTLEBY posted. ""I imagined him by his mother's bedside doing just that ... and typing in his tweet with his other hand. It's his way of dealing, but in my experience, sometimes you're more in the moment if you just put your mobile device away."" On the blog Millers Time, the author makes an observation that sums up much of the social media reaction: . ""I am drawn to this for two reasons: I believe Scott Simon is doing a service to us all, opening a window into a life event that many of us have or will experience. In his willingness to share what he is experiencing, in his wonderfully honest and sincere way, he hopefully opens a dialogue families can have prior to such an end of life experience,"" the author, who identifies himself as ""Richard"" says. ""We do not talk enough, I believe, with each other and with our parents about the end of life, especially when there is still time to discuss some of the issues involved.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The number of people forced to flee their homes in Afghanistan is increasing and the conditions for the displaced are falling well below international standards, a new study by the Norwegian Refugee Council found. In 2012 alone, spreading conflict in Afghanistan has forced more than 166,000 Afghans to flee their homes, bringing the total number of people internally displaced by conflict to at least 460,000 since the fall of the Taliban in late 2001, according to the council's report. The numbers alone don't tell the full story, it says. Most of the internally displaced people ""are living in appalling conditions and in situations of extreme poverty,"" Dan Tyler, protection and advocacy manager at NRC Afghanistan, told CNN. India-Pakistan dynamic holds key to Afghanistan's future . Lack of employment, insufficient food and water supplies, and poor quality housing or shelters -- typically tents or unsubstantial mud homes -- are among the problems internally displaced people are facing, especially during the winter, when their shelters can not offer enough protection against the cold, the report says. Last winter brought Afghanistan's displacement crisis into sharp focus, and revealed the scale of suffering facing displaced people, with reports of ""at least 100 confirmed deaths, mostly of children, who died from the cold or illness in Kabul alone,"" Tyler said. One of the displaced people, Mohammad Ibrahim, 42, fled his home in Greshk district of southern Helmand province almost three years ago with his wife and five children. Now he lives under a mud hut in a makeshift camp in the eastern part of Kabul, the capital city. ""I am really worried about what will happen to our children this winter,"" Ibrahim told CNN. ""Last winter more than 10 children died just in our makeshift camp due to cold, and I don't know how many more would die this winter, which has already started."" Ibrahim added that last year he thought that he would be in a better situation by this year's winter, ""but I was wrong."" The study also says that displaced families report facing obstacles to find health services and to access education for their children, with over a third of the displaced children lacking access to schools. According to Tyler, very few provinces are immune from either receiving or creating internally displace people, but the southern and southeastern regions are the main origination areas, and the majority of people go to big cities, especially Kabul, where security and livelihood opportunities, as well as access to services, is perceived to be greater. Afghan bank fraud siphoned out savers' money, independent report says . The report adds that more than half of the people surveyed identified the Taliban and other anti-government groups as the key causes of insecurity in their homes communities and the primary drivers of their displacement. The Norwegian Refugee Council's study reveals worrying gaps in protection and assistance because of the challenges of collecting information and coordinating responses amid increasing insecurity. Many humanitarian actors tasked with collecting data on displacement have limited access to those most in need, it says. The Afghan government's response to the displacement crisis has also been inadequate, the report says. Insufficient funding, capacity and lack of expertise on the part of central and local authorities means conditions for the displaced, both during the period of their displacement and during the course of their return have fallen well below international standards, according to the study. ""There is also concern that, as international troops withdraw from Afghanistan (by 2014), there will be less funding available to meet the humanitarian needs"" of internally displaced people, Tyler said. There is growing awareness that during and beyond the security transition, more would need to be done to profile the needs of displaced people. ""But whether the humanitarian community will have time to prepare (for), or the funding to respond to a deepening displacement crisis is far from certain,"" he warned.

"(CNN) -- We watched in horror this week at the execution of an Afghan woman who was shot nine times while a crowd of roaring men who call themselves Muslim cheered and screamed. We were reminded of a similar tragedy that took place in 1999 in which a mother of five, clad in a blue burqa, was shot dead in a soccer stadium in Kabul. Both of these women were wrongfully accused of adultery, as there was no proof, evidence, fair trial, due process or justice. The similarities between the two slayings signaled to us that not much has changed in Afghanistan in the decade since the United States first became involved there. When we Americans ask why we have failed in Afghanistan, we blame the Afghans' antiquated tribal practices and their hate of America's freedom, and most of all, we blame their religion: Islam. Though we have said it over and over again, let us reiterate once more: The actions of these men were in absolute and supreme violation of God's laws, and Islam does not condone unmitigated violence of any kind. Period. Manhunt under way for Taliban who shot woman in public execution . Though the U.S. declared the promotion of women's rights, human rights and democracy as its policy goals before invading Afghanistan, it would appear that all three were lost in our efforts to establish a ""secular"" democracy in an Islamic Republic. When our government deployed our troops intending to eliminate al Qaeda and the Taliban and establish a new government in Afghanistan, we took responsibility for the future of its people. Is it not tragic, after all the bloodshed and the billions of taxpayers' dollars spent, that there could be a resurgence of the Taliban and this kind of unimaginable violence? When the U.S. leaves Afghanistan permanently, Afghan women will undoubtedly suffer. Throughout the past decade, our policymakers have failed to take into account the important role that religion held (and still holds) in the structure of Afghan society. If we want to affect the way that Afghans conceptualize important notions such as justice, we must understand the forces in their lives that guide their decisions. Poll: Religion is not the biggest enemy for Arab women . After 30 years of constant warfare, unstable political, civil and governmental systems and a dismal education system, many Afghans look to religious authorities to guide their actions. The solution to fighting extremism and affecting change in Afghanistan lies within the religious system; secular ideologies that are imposed on Afghans are alien to them. Having said this, Americans do not have to sacrifice our goals of spreading democracy and peace to the Afghan people. Just as our Founding Fathers established ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" as basic rights for all Americans, so too does Islam establish the protection and preservation of life, religion, family, intellect, property and dignity for all. We must look for ways in which such rights can be realized, and ways in which we can work with Afghans to address these injustices. In 2006, Daisy founded the Women's Islamic Initiative on Spirituality and Equality (WISE), a social justice movement that works to reclaim women's rights in Islam. Its Global Muslim Women's Shura Council of scholars and activists were so compelled by the level of violence against women that they published ""Jihad Against Violence,"" (PDF) a report that condemns both violent extremism and domestic violence. The response to this report, along with WISE's Imam Training Program to End Violence against Women in Afghanistan, was overwhelming. Many Afghan imams confided in us that the scriptural evidence that we provided helped them to realize that they were propagating distorted and incorrect interpretations of the Quran, unintentionally. Egypt's Islamists: Much to prove on women's rights . The value of these religious literacy trainings were so transformative that we were told, ""The U.S. government should not have spent billions (on the war); they should have spent millions and involved the imams (with regards to women's rights), and everything would have been different today."" Similarly, an Afghan woman told us, ""imams are our only shield against the Taliban."" The Arab Spring has forced U.S. policymakers to acknowledge the fundamental importance of engaging with religious-political movements in the Middle East, and efforts to include these movements are gradually making their way into our foreign policy. As Muslims, we know that it is only in the religious sphere that we can achieve our vision of peace, democracy, prosperity and the realization of human and women's rights in Afghanistan, and prevent atrocities like public executions from ever happening again.

"(CNN) -- Joe Saenz rubbed his hands together and smiled as he walked up to a Los Angeles County, California, home. His demeanor gave no clues as to what would happen next. Once in the front yard of the home, police said, he drew a gun and shot the victim several times, then in the head, execution-style. The slaying, caught on tape in October 2008, was over drug money, police said. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Traci Gonzales knew there were drug and gang ties to the slaying, so she showed the videotape to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Ron Chavarria, a veteran on the gang beat. At the time, Gonzales had no idea that videotape would break open a case that has frustrated local and federal authorities for a decade. Saenz had eluded authorities for so long, they thought he might be dead. Now, they knew Saenz, wanted in connection with four murders, a kidnapping and a rape, was still out there. Saenz is the newest person on the FBI's Most Wanted List, after three fugitives on the list were recently caught. A member of the Cuatro Flats gang, Saenz first stepped into police crosshairs in 1998. He was wanted for shooting and killing two rival gang members at a housing complex in the Hollenbeck area of Los Angeles. Then, he was a fresh-faced 22-year-old with a dark side. ""Just gruesome, gruesome, cold-blooded,"" Chavarria said. ""Just walks right up to these guys, shoots them and then just walks over and stands over them and shoots them each in the head and casually walks away."" They knew he was dangerous, and they had to find him. ""We had pictures of him constantly on our dashboard so that there was no question if we saw this guy we knew who he was,"" Chavarria said. Within days, Saenz -- also known as Jose Saenz, Louie Louie and more than two dozen other aliases -- was wanted for a third murder. Investigators said Saenz suspected the mother of his child, Sigreta Hernandez, would turn him in, so he kidnapped, raped and murdered her at his grandmother's house. ""He leaves a note indicating that his grandmother has nothing to do with the murder and that he left the scene. And from that point on he became a fugitive for the next 10 years,"" Gonzales said. FBI Special Agent Scott Garriola believes Saenz graduated from local gangs to international drug trafficking -- crossing the border with falsified documents. ""He's believed to be linked with the cartels in Mexico, bringing large amounts of narcotics into the Los Angeles area, Garriola said.

"(CNN) -- North Korea pledged Wednesday to take steps to reopen the Kaesong Industrial Zone, the joint manufacturing complex where it halted the operations of South Korean companies during a period of high tensions this year. The announcement from the North is its latest move after multiple rounds of talks with the South, aimed at getting the shuttered factories at Kaesong back up and running, failed to yield a breakthrough last month. Seoul responded to Pyongyang's statement Wednesday by agreeing to fresh negotiations on the complex next week. North Korea's decision in April to suspend activity at the industrial zone, a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, for the first time in its nine-year history surprised many observers. With 53,000 North Koreans working at more than 120 South Korean companies, Kaesong was considered to be an important source of hard currency for Kim Jong Un's regime. But for about four months, the zone, which sits on the North's side of the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas, has lain dormant. In its statement Wednesday carried by state media, North Korea said it would allow South Korean companies to return to the manufacturing complex. Pyongyang began preventing South Koreans from entering the zone in April at a time when it was unleashing a torrent of threatening rhetoric toward South Korea and the United States. The tensions have since eased, and the generally secretive North recently allowed a large Western media contingent, including CNN journalists, to cover the 60th anniversary of the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953. The North also said Wednesday that it would ensure ""the normal attendance of its workers"" at the South Korean companies' factories, as well as guaranteeing the safety of South Korean personnel in the zone. The North Korean statement said that if South Korea responded to its ""bold and magnanimous stand,"" it would hold another round of talks next week on returning operations at the zone to normal. ""We are looking forward to reaching an appropriate measure for resolving the Kaesong issue,"" the South Korean Unification Ministry said in a statement accepting the offer of talks. On Sunday, the South suggested that time for finding a solution on Kaesong might be running out. ""The patience of our people, who wish to see North Korea's sincere attitude, is reaching its limit, and North Korea should bear that in mind,"" said Kim Hyung-suk, a Unification Ministry spokesman. The South Korean government has been working on measures to compensate the companies hurt by the shuttering of the industrial zone. On Wednesday, before the North Korean announcement, the South's Ministry of Unification said it had authorized the equivalent of about $250 million in insurance payments to firms with activities linked to the zone. CNN's K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.","NEW: Seoul agrees to hold talks with the North on Kaesong complex next week .

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- Amid the chaos that first-responder Ray Corbo witnessed on Friday, there is one image that he will never forget. It isn't the woman who was taken to the hospital after being shot in the foot at Sandy Hook Elementary. It isn't the police officer he saw leaving the school's interior covered in someone's blood. What will haunt Corbo forever is the memory of parents lined up outside the firehouse just a few hundred feet away from the school, waiting to pick up their children. ""As the children were coming down the street, little by little, classroom by classroom all holding hands, parents were claiming their children,"" says Corbo, the first assistant fire chief at Newtown Hook and Ladder No. 1. ""After a little while, once they claimed their kid and signed them out ... they left. ""There were some sticking around and that's when we realized that they're probably not going to be leaving. They're gonna get the confirmation soon enough that they're not gonna be grabbing their child and hugging them and taking them home."" Remembering the victims . Corbo's voice is steady, but his eyes glisten. ""Their life is changed forever."" Corbo, along with Rob Manna, the department's chief engineer, were among the first responders to Friday's school massacre of 20 children and six adults. Manna was working less than half a mile from the school in the center of Sandy Hook when he got the call. ""I was there very soon,"" he says. At the time, he says, he had no idea what he was walking into. Corbo and Manna were assigned outside the school, to an emergency triage area that didn't end up being used. Despite their combined nearly half-century of experience, the two men say nothing could have ever prepared them for what they have now personally experienced. ""You get the initial dispatch, and you really don't know what you're coming in to, but for the most part, you're ready for it,"" Corbo says. ""But this time, it was not the case ... if you think you're ready for this, you're not. ""Very early on, it was determined that this was bad -- really, really bad."" Police and paramedics, some clad in body armor and bulletproof vests, entered the school cautiously. ""They had to find out if anyone survived ... if there was anyone to take care of,"" Manna says. Outside, it was mass confusion. Phone calls and text messages spread nearly faster than reports on police radios. ""It was chaos down there. Parents were coming from all directions. You could see the panic in everybody's face, because they have no idea what they're coming into,"" Corbo says. ""They were panic-stricken and trying to get to their children, but they were stopped."" At the nearby firehouse, he says, he saw parents waiting in line for hours to pick up their children. ""And there's no more kids around to take home,"" Corbo says. ""And you know, it's bad. They're gonna get some bad news. I'm sure they knew at that point, but there's that shred of hope there's somebody hiding in closet or some kid they missed, but ultimately that wasn't the case."" Corbo is a father to a first-grader and, had they not moved two years ago, his 7-year-old son Joey would have attended Sandy Hook Elementary. When he returned home Friday, the former Marine did what many of the parents outside the school could not. ""'I love you' was the first thing I said,"" Corbo recalls. ""And we hugged a lot. Of course, he's 7 years old, so a hug in the morning is fine, and before you go to bed, but getting hugged all day long, he's wondering what the heck's going on. ""He'll understand someday."" Manna says his grieving will come later. ""For now, (I've) gotta be strong."" Today, Newtown is awash with emblems of tragedy: an enormous American flag, starkly silhouetted against the sky, flies at half-staff in the middle of Main Street. Just east, on the road that leads towards Sandy Hook Elementary, a host of 27 wooden angel statues sing a silent chorus on the roadside, a tribute to those who died Friday. Police say Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother at the home they shared, before carrying out the rampage at the school where he left 26 dead and also shot and killed himself. A small bright note is the overwhelming support Newtown has been receiving from around the country and the world -- including truckloads of teddy bears that firefighters are distributing to children's groups, schools and churches.. ""The community will go on,"" Corbo says. ""We have to. There are still a lot of children in this town waiting for Christmas to come. You have to move on. For their sake, it's gotta be back to normal as soon as we can get it."" Watch CNN Newsroom weekdays 9am to 3pm ET and weekends.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Syrian rebels call them ""wizwayzi,"" humming eyes in the sky they say guide the government warplanes and gunners who bombard their positions. They're surveillance drones, easily visible from the ground and seen in video shot by rebel fighters. Syrian opposition activists and rebel commanders say both the tempo and accuracy of airstrikes have increased since government forces began using them -- and they point to Iran as the source of the equipment. ""Of course it's Iranian. It doesn't go up that high. We can see it,"" Muhiyee Deen al-Zein, a Free Syrian Army leader in Homs, told CNN. ""They say, 'The wizwayzi is out.' It's a small drone that films al-Qusayr, and then you think, 'Oh God, help al-Qusayr, it will sleep under rockets.' "" Opposition activists say the number of airstrikes has gone up sharply since the collapse of a cease-fire for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, growing from about 20 a day before the truce to as many as 60 a day this week. Wednesday, Russian-built MiG jets pounded targets in the Damascus suburbs, near the port of Latakia and around the cities of Deir Ezzor and Idlib, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Rebels have displayed captured aircraft they describe as Iranian-built drones -- brightly colored, pilotless jets. They're accompanied by training manuals emblazoned with the image of Iran's revolutionary leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Syria is Iran's leading ally in the region. The Islamic republic has said it doesn't supply military aid to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which is battling a 19-month-old revolt, but Iran hasn't commented on the drone allegations. Defense analysts say the aircraft displayed by the rebels resemble Iranian drones, but cautioned that they could be training craft or even fakes. And at the United Nations, British diplomats said they are ""deeply concerned by credible information that Iran is providing military support"" to al-Assad. But there's no smoking gun connecting Tehran to the recent airstrikes -- leaving only a distant, suspicious hum in the air over Syria.","Syrian rebels say Iranian drones are guiding government attacks .

"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- Using DNA to catch criminals has become common, but police in Denver, Colorado, this year demonstrated how the practice can be taken to a new level: They tracked down a suspect not through his DNA, but through that of his brother. Here's how it happened, the Denver district attorney's office said: . In February 2008, two cars were broken into. Police found blood at both scenes and ran the samples through DNA databases but couldn't find a match. Then, as part of a study being conducted by the district attorney's office, investigators used new software to see whether the DNA in the blood was close enough to potentially be from a family member of someone in the criminal DNA database. The software came up with six potential matches. Five didn't pan out, but one led police to a convicted car thief and, ultimately, that man's brother, Luis Jaimes-Tinajero. Jaimes-Tinajero pleaded guilty in September to one count of criminal trespass and received a sentence of two years' probation. Attempts to contact Jaimes-Tinajero for this report were unsuccessful. District Attorney Mitch Morrissey called it one of the first cases in the country to use software to find familial DNA matches. ""Our hope here is to show that it works, which we have done,"" he said. ""I think it's a valuable way to generate leads."" Morrissey's office developed the software tool with the Denver police, he said. He hopes to use it to solve murders, rapes and cold cases. The matches to family members won't be used as evidence itself, he said, but rather as a way to generate leads for investigators to explore, similar to the way police may use a witness report of a partial license plate. ""There's no reason to bring this into court,"" Morrissey said. ""You use the science, you use the DNA, then you use a conventional investigation."" But some privacy advocates are crying foul. ""Family members have done nothing wrong to get in the database,"" said Maryland defense attorney Stephen Mercer. ""And this is an example of the web of suspicion of people who have committed offenses being widened to include their entire family."" Mercer has been fighting familial DNA searches since 2003. He was part of an effort that led to Maryland being the first state to outlaw familial DNA searches. ""People have a reasonable expectation of privacy of their DNA,"" he said. ""It's a basic violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution"" Morrissey disagrees. ""I've yet to hear anyone explain how this is a violation of the U.S. Constitution,"" he said. ""The bad guy abandoned the DNA at the crime scene. They have no expectation of privacy."" Mercer also argued that even though the technique may be successful in certain cases, that doesn't mean it is worth potential infringements on constitutional rights. ""If they want to drive down the street and do no-knock searches of homes, they would catch bad guys,"" he said. ""But at what cost to our society?"" Morrissey hopes to have his office's familial DNA study completed sometime in the coming year. In Colorado, the criminal DNA database includes people convicted of felonies. In the fall of 2010 Colorado will begin taking DNA samples at the time a person is charged with a felony. If a person is found not guilty or if charges are dropped, he or she can request to have the samples removed from the database. Mercer said that's a slippery slope. ""Where it leads is toward the development of a universal database from the time they are born,"" he said. ""They want everyone in the database.""","Denver police this year tracked down a car theft suspect using his brother's DNA .

"(CNN) -- The largest great white shark expedition in U.S. history is at sea off the coast of Massachusetts -- the same waters fictionally terrorized by the most infamous great white of them all in the film ""Jaws."" ""Expedition Cape Cod 2013"" is led by OCEARCH, a nonprofit that researches and tracks the migration of sharks, among other things, on its Global Shark Tracker website. OCEARCH researchers, who set out on Monday, will spend the next month trying to capture, tag and release 20 great white sharks in the water off of Cape Cod, Massachusetts -- an area that has seen an uptick in shark visits in recent years. Shark attack claims Brazilian teen's life . ""The increased summertime population of great white sharks off Cape Cod has drawn significant science and public safety attention,"" said Greg Skomal, who is heading up the team of researchers. Their study will seek to find out why . Tony LaCasse, spokesman for the New England Aquarium in Boston, says the increase in shark sightings in that part of the world is actually the result of a very good thing: the return of an ecosystem. White sharks love to dine on gray seals, and gray seals eat fish -- the very same fish Massachusetts fishermen were trying to catch. It was custom for them to be shot on site a generation ago, explains LaCasse. Opinion: How the world is saving sharks . That stopped in 1972 with the passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. But the damage had already been done, the gray seal population had been nearly wiped out, and the great white had to seek dinner elsewhere. Those that remained became the target of fishermen, thanks to Hollywood. ""There was a dramatic reduction in the population of great white sharks in the wake of 'Jaws,' "" LaCasse told CNN. Man wrestles sharks with his bare hands . Now, several years later -- about enough time for a seal population to regenerate and for great whites to be attracted by a food source -- ""Jaws"" returns for a sequel, sort of. But not everyone is headed north for a summer on the Cape -- ""Lori Anne"" is a female shark that OCEARCH tagged near Cape Cod last June. According to Global Shark Tracker, Tuesday she turned up off the coast of West Palm Beach, Florida.","The waters off Cape Cod have seen an uptick in shark visits in recent years .

"(CNN) -- Wikipedia was back Thursday, a day after shutting down the website to protest anti-piracy bills now in Congress. On the website early Thursday morning was the cryptic message: ""Thank you for protecting Wikipedia. We're not done yet."" Clicking on that message takes a Wikipedia viewer to a thank you letter and instructions on how to continue fighting against anti-piracy bills that critics say could amount to censorship. ""Your voice was loud and strong,"" the message said. ""Millions of people have spoken in defense of a free and open Internet."" Wikipedia was among several websites to shut down Wednesday in protest of the bills. Instead of the usual encyclopedia articles, visitors to Wikipedia's English-language site were greeted by a message about the decision to black out its Web page for an entire day. Why Wikipedia went down at midnight . However, users were able to access Wikipedia on some smartphones. The site and several others went dark at midnight Tuesday; others followed suit later in the day. The protest is in response to the Stop Online Piracy Act bill, a piece of proposed legislation that is working its way through the Congress. A Senate committee approved a similar bill in May called the Protect IP Act, which is now pending before the full Senate. The controversy over SOPA and PIPA has turned into an all-out war between Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Media companies have united in favor of the bills, while tech's power players are throwing their might into opposing them. ""Both SOPA and PIPA are threats not just to the U.S. economy, and not just to all the jobs that this tech sector creates, but if they had existed, Steve Huffman and I could have never founded Reddit,"" said Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded the site. Millions visit Reddit to submit interesting links from websites, discuss them and vote on them, he said, calling it ""sort of a democratic front page of the web."" Reddit also went dark Wednesday morning and was back Thursday. One member of Congress, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, who opposes the bills, said the unprecedented blackouts had ""turned the tide against a backroom lobbying effort by interests that aren't used to being told no."" Issa is pushing for consideration of his own plan, the OPEN act, addressing the matter. CNN's Ed Payne, Julianne Pepitone, John D. Sutter, Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","The protest is in response to the Stop Online Piracy Act legislation .

"(CNN) -- Think 1960s America and images of hippies, Vietnam protests, the civil rights movement, sexual revolution and drug experimentation will mostly likely spring to mind. ""The Times They Are A-Changin,"" Bob Dylan famously sung as counterculture ideas gripped the west's imagination -- much to the horror of the establishment. Sport was no different, with one of the decade's most iconic images that of U.S. sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos making their gloved Black Power salutes at the 1968 Mexico Olympics, catapulting the issue of American segregation to a worldwide audience. It was no easy ride for U.S. female sporting pioneers in the 1960s either. Jockey Diane Crump faced such vitriol at her first race that the 18-year-old required a full police escort. The first professional female jockey in the U.S. still remembers the mayhem that surrounded her as she took to the Hialeah Park Race Track in Florida in 1969. The petite teenager with curly brown locks was forced to fight her way through the flashing cameras and jeering crowd to a small office -- the only available space for a female to change. ""The crowd was just swarming all over me. They were crazy, up in arms,"" Crump told CNN. ""The hecklers were yelling: 'Go back to the kitchen and cook dinner.' That was the mentality at the time. ""They thought I was going to be the downfall of the whole sport, which is such a medieval thought. I was like: 'Come on people, this is the 1960s!'"" Today there are several dozen female jockeys racing professionally in North America, compared with the hundreds of male jockeys who still dominate the sport. Women are making progress -- albeit it slowly -- with Chantal Sutherland becoming the first female jockey to compete in the world's richest horse race, the $10million Dubai World Cup, earlier this year. Speaking from her home in Linden, Virginia, feisty 63-year-old Crump explained half the battle, as she fought to ride professionally, was simply getting male jockeys to compete against her. In 1968 two female riders had been forced to drop out of their races after the male jockeys boycotted the race, even going to the extent of throwing stones at the women's changing room trailers. ""People were saying we weren't strong enough or smart enough to ride in a pari-mutuel (professional gambling) race,"" Crump said. ""They thought it would be dangerous for other people to ride against us because we wouldn't know what to do under pressure."" It was only when officials threatened to fine or suspend refusenik male jockeys that Diane finally got her chance to compete. The smiley teen dressed in pink silks happily proved the naysayers wrong, riding horse Bridle n Bit to a respectable ninth place in a 12-strong field. ""When I finally got on the horse it was perfect because everyone just cares about the race,"" Crump said. ""Everyone cheered me when I came back. Sure, I had a handful of hecklers, but for the most part I never encountered too much trouble from the crowd after that."" As Crump explains, women simply weren't a part of the horse racing world in the 1960s. ""A woman's place was in the kitchen or caring for the children,"" she said. ""The women's rights movement was happening, but to be honest all I cared about was horses. I just wanted to ride. I marched to the beat of my own drum. ""Yes, I'm a feminist. But I've always seen myself as more of an equal rights activist."" Just two weeks after her debut, Crump returned to the track to win her first professional race. In a career spanning three decades, she rode 300 winners, and became the first woman to compete in the prestigious Kentucky Derby in 1970 -- a race that only six women have taken part in since it was first run in 1875. Crump, who grew up in Oldsmare, Florida, says no one in her family ""had ever even heard of a horse,"" let alone the Kentucky Derby, until she began riding at a nearby ranch as a 13-year-old. But even younger brother Bert, who was serving in Vietnam at the time, was glued to his radio for that historic Kentucky Derby race. Bunkered down in his barracks with around 100 other soldiers, Bert cheered on as his sister rode horse Fathom in one of the country's most famous Derbys, finishing 15th in a field of 17. Now a grandmother-of-two, Crump still receives hundreds of letters from children every year asking her how it felt to make history that day. ""It was great for me as a rider, as a female and as a person,"" Crump said. ""For someone to think I was capable of riding in the Kentucky Derby was a huge step forward."" Crump's racing career took her to competitions across the world, with her popularity skyrocketing -- in of all places -- in Puerto Rico. She recalls a race in the early 1970s which saw her and a Puerto Rican jockey whipping each other in a fierce battle on the field. While leading the pack, Crump realized the jockey just behind was holding on to her saddle, giving his horse a free ride. In the days before CCTV cameras, Crump did what any jockey would do and get away with -- she got out her stick and whacked him. The pair spent the remainder of the race hitting each other until finally he pulled away in the last leg and won. ""When he came off the track, the women in the crowd blasted him with tomatoes, eggs, anything they could find,"" Crump said. ""They were booing their own country's jockey, threatening bodily harm to him after the race, while I was greeted by cheering, enthusiastic women."" After marrying and the birth of her two daughters, Crump juggled her racing career and family life until a horrific accident in 1992 left her virtually bed-bound for months. ""The horse I was riding fell backwards and I broke my leg in six or seven places. The doctors said I would never ride again,"" Crump said. ""But despite the fact I looked like some sort of bionic woman with braces on my legs, I eventually started training again."" She finally retired in 1999, setting up her own equine sales business. Crump remains pragmatic about her contribution to the industry -- arguing that while things are still not quite equal for female jockeys, they have come a long way since 1969. ""When I was 16 and first got my exercise rider's license there was not one other female stable hand. But by the 1990s around half were women,"" Crump said. ""Somebody had to open the door. It wasn't all down to me but I think I was a big part of that."" She added: ""The mentality in the 1960s was that women weren't smart or strong enough to be jockeys. But I proved that a woman could do the job. ""I like to think I was a little footprint on the path to equality.""","1960s America was a time of shaking up the establishment -- and sport was no exception .

"Paris (CNN) -- Former French President Jacques Chirac was found guilty Thursday on corruption charges stemming from his time as mayor of Paris and given a two-year suspended sentence, a court in the French capital announced. He was convicted of breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and illegal use of influence, the Paris Court's press office said. Chirac did not attend the trial, which was held from September 5-23, due to his medical condition, which doctors described as a ""severe"" and ""irreversible"" neurological problem. In a statement released later Thursday, Chirac, 79, said that while he ""categorically refuse(s) this ruling,"" he would not appeal the verdict. ""Unfortunately I no longer have all the strength necessary to carry the fight for truth by myself and face of new panel of judges,"" Chirac said in the statement. ""I also realize that what is at stake is not only the honour of a man, but the dignity of the presidential office."" An aide to French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the Elysee, or presidential palace, would not comment on the verdict, according to the French newspaper Le Monde. Francois Hollande, the presidential candidate from the Socialist party, said Thursday that ""justice has been done, and it had to be done, so that there would be no sense of impunity."" However, he said, he did have some sympathy for Chirac. ""Although the sentence is severe, it is both criminal and moral, and it affects him,"" Hollande added, according to Le Monde. Ecologist party presidential candidate Eva Joly declared that justice has been done. ""No citizen is above the law, if we want to reestablish trust in the justice system and democracy,"" she said in a statement on her website. She also called on Chirac to resign from France's Constitutional Council, a body that decides if proposed laws are constitutional. Chirac and other former French presidents automatically serve on the council. Jerome Karsenti, of the anti-corruption group Anticor, lauded the ruling as ""a historic decision and extremely important for the future of democracy. It's a message to all politicians."" Chirac was mayor of Paris, from 1977 to 1995, before he became president. He had immunity from prosecution during the 12 years he was president of France, from 1995 to 2007. He was accused -- along with the other defendants -- of using public money to pay people to work for his political party, the RPR, and to pay others to perform jobs that did not really exist. Former French Prime Minister Alain Juppe was sentenced in December 2004 for his role in the affair. After Chirac left office as president, he made it known he was available to answer any questions on the matter. He always denied wrongdoing. The city of Paris dropped a civil suit against Chirac after he and his party paid back about $3 million. Some in France praised the court's decision. ""Finally, the justice of the Republic has come,"" said a post from Pierre-Marie Muraz on Le Monde's website. It shows that ""no, we are not a banana republic, but a democracy, and proud of it!"" Others were not pleased. ""Who are we kidding? Let's review: Politician and union leaders have flouted the country's rules for years, enriching themselves and betraying the trust of their citizens, and when 20 years later we relax, we hand out a penalty or a suspended sentence, a certain political class and the complacent media congratulate themselves on the exemplary justice!"" posted someone with the user name ""pas dupe"" -- which means ""not fooled"" in English.","Chirac has always denied wrongdoing while mayor of Paris .

"(CNN) -- An appeals court on Monday sided with the federal government in blocking several provisions in Alabama and Georgia's controversial anti-illegal immigration laws, while allowing other key parts of those laws to stand. Advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center applauded the decisions, with National Immigration Law Center executive director Marielena Hincapie saying in a statement they ""should send a strong message that state attempts to criminalize immigrants and their loved ones will not be tolerated."" Still, while three judges from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did strike down more challenged provisions than they allowed in a pair of rulings, officials from both Alabama and Georgia pointed out that the vast majority of their states' immigration laws remain valid. ""The essence of Alabama's immigration law has been upheld by today's ruling,"" Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said in a statement. ""The core of (the) law remains if you live or work in the state, you should do so legally."" Talking about the appeals court decision's effect on his state's law, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said, ""While I disagree with the Court's decision on Section 7, after over a year of litigation, only one of 23 sections of HB 87 has been invalidated."" Undocumented immigrants line up for relief from deportation . While dealing with two different states and laws, both decisions were signed on by a trio of judges -- Charles Wilson, Beverly Martin and Richard Voorhees -- who considered the two cases at the same time. The issue of illegal immigration has become a hot-button issue in recent years, with several states passing their own laws in bids to boost local and state law enforcement agencies powers to prevent undocumented residents from living, working and getting benefits in their states. Political leaders in these states, many of them Republican, have criticized the federal government for not doing enough in this regard and argued this lack of action made it imperative that states do more. But the federal government has challenged all or parts of many of these laws, insisting that it is the federal governments' responsibility, and not individual states, to enact and enforce immigration laws. The U.S. Supreme Court waded into this debate in June, when it ruled by a 5-3 vote to uphold the authority of the federal government to set immigration policies and laws while weighing in on legislation in Arizona that helped kickstart the debate. The court, however, did allow one of the most controversial provisions of that state's law to stand: letting local and state police check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. The rulings Monday resembled that high court ruling in many respects, with the appeals court judges' Alabama decision even quoting U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority ruling on the Arizona. ""Although (illegal immigration) is a problem that gives rise to unique issues in our nation, we must be mindful that individual states 'may not pursue policies that undermine federal law,'"" the three judges said. One provision the court assessing the two state's laws did let stand, as the Supreme Court had in the Arizona case, is to allow law enforcement to check the immigration status of those suspected of a crime. Taking the chance of a lifetime . This was one of only two provisions in the Georgia legislation, known as HB 87, that the federal appeals court considered. The other would institute three crimes for ""interactions with an 'illegal alien'."" These are knowingly transporting such a person ""while committing another criminal offense,"" ""concealing or harboring"" an undocumented person and lastly ""inducing an illegal alien to go into"" Georgia, according to the appeals court ruling citing the state's legislation. The federal court struck down this aspect of Georgia's law, known as Section 7, on Monday. ""We are ... convinced that Section 7 presents an obstacle to the execution of the federal statutory scheme and challenges federal supremacy in the realm of immigration,"" the court explained as part of its reasoning. Four provisions of Alabama's law were blocked by the appeals court judges on Monday, while three still stand despite the federal government's arguments. Faces of hope: Lining up for two more years in the U.S. Authorities in that state cannot make it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work or solicit work, as prescribed by the legislation known as HB 56 but denied by Monday's ruling. Similarly, the appeals court upheld a lower court ruling and knocked down parts of the law that would have made it a crime to hide ""an alien,"" to encourage one to live in the state, to transport such a person or agree to a rental agreement. The provision prohibiting companies that employ undocumented workers from taking a state tax deduction for wages (and instituting stiff penalties for those who don't abide by this law) was also blocked. So, too, was part of the Alabama legislation to characterized the hiring or employment of a illegal immigrant over a U.S. citizen or ""alien authorized to work"" in the country as a ""discriminatory practice."" Yet the federal government's argument in favor of jettisoning other measures were determined ""at this stage (to be) facially invalid"" by the appeals court. That includes checking into a person's citizenship if a driver does show police his or her driver's license. The court also ruled that Alabama can prevent illegal immigrants from engaging in a ""business transaction"" (except for pursuing a marriage license) with a state or municipal government agency, as HB 56 states.

"(CNN) -- Champion jockey Frankie Dettori has vowed to ""rebuild his reputation"" after accepting a six-month suspension, having been found guilty of using a banned substance. Dettori, who will be 42 this month, tested positive in France on September 16 for a drug that has widely reported by British media to have been cocaine. He was cautioned by police for possession of the drug in 1993. France Galop, the country's horse racing ruling body, announced on Wednesday that the Italian will be banned from November 20 to May 19, though it did not reveal the substance in question. It has asked other horse racing authorities around the world to enforce its decision. ""For similar cases, France Galop has never revealed the substances found and will therefore not reveal the substance for this specific case,"" spokesman Julien Pescatore said. Dettori's legal representative Christopher Stewart-Moore said the jockey had accepted the punishment. ""He also accepts that he has let down the sport he loves and all those associated with it, as well as the wider public,"" Stewart-Moore said in a statement. ""But most of all, and this is his greatest regret, he has let down his wife and children."" Dettori, who has five children with wife Catherine, is one of the world's most successful jockeys. He is most famous for riding seven successive winners in one meeting at prestigious English course Ascot in 1996, and has more than 500 Group-level victories in his career so far. He is a household name in Britain, where one bookmaker announced odds of his chances of success in next year's premier meetings immediately after the French authority's decision was announced. Dettori revealed in October that he will be ending his fulltime role at the Godolphin stable next year, and last month news broke about his positive test during a race meeting at the Longchamps course in Paris. ""Racing has been good to Frankie and he knows that his privileged position brings with it responsibility,"" Stewart-Moore said. ""For this reason he is determined to rebuild his reputation when he returns to the saddle."" France Galop said Dettori will have to undergo further drug testing from April 20 before he is allowed to return to racing. Stewart-Moore said the three-time British champion, who has admitted taking weight-loss drugs in the past, is taking full responsibility for the failed test. ""He is clear that the responsibility for his current situation lies squarely with him,"" Stewart-Moore said . ""From the start of France Galop's inquiry he has acknowledged to them he has made a mistake and that the fault was his. ""Finally, he has asked me to thank everyone for the many messages of support he and his family have received."" The British Professional Jockeys' Association said it would support Dettori's rehabilitation, but denied there was a widespread problem of drug use among its members. ""From 2,607 in-competition urine tests and 3,697 breath tests since 2005, there is no evidence to suggest that there is a fundamental drug problem with jockeys,"" PJA chief executive Paul Struthers said. ""0.3% of urine tests were positive for drugs and 0.2% of both urine and breath tests were positive for alcohol."" The PJA said from 2005-11 it had recorded four positive tests for cocaine, one for cannabis and two for diuretics (water shedding drugs) -- both of which were for amateur riders. One alcohol positive was above the drink driving limit, and five were below. Struthers said the PJA was aiming to raise awareness about the issue of jockeys' mental wellbeing. ""As well as all the normal pressures that other sportsmen and women have to contend with, unlike many other sports jockeys have the added pressures of massively reduced calorific intake and are constantly at very real risk of serious injury,"" he said. ""When it comes to mental wellbeing, racing perhaps lags behind other sports particularly when it comes to raising awareness of the issues and the support that is available, and it is overdue that more was done.""","French racing authority bans Frankie Dettori for six months over positive drug test .

"Editor's Note: The FBI had three openings on its list of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Monday night, FBI Assistant Director Kevin Perkins joined CNN's Rick Sanchez exclusively on ""Campbell Brown"" to announce who filled the first open spot. Tune in at 8 p.m. ET to ""Campbell Brown"" over the next two nights to find out who else will fill the slots. Officials say Joe Saenz is thought to be linked with Mexican drug cartels. (CNN) -- Joe Saenz rubbed his hands together and smiled as he walked up to a Los Angeles County, California, home. His demeanor gave no clues as to what would happen next. Once in the front yard of the home, police said, he drew a gun and shot the victim several times, then in the head, execution-style. The slaying, caught on tape in October 2008, was over drug money, police said. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Traci Gonzales knew there were drug and gang ties to the slaying, so she showed the videotape to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Ron Chavarria, a veteran on the gang beat.  Watch why Saenz made the list » . At the time, Gonzales had no idea that videotape would break open a case that has frustrated local and federal authorities for a decade. Saenz had eluded authorities for so long, they thought he might be dead. Now, they knew Saenz, wanted in connection with four murders, a kidnapping and a rape, was still out there. Saenz is the newest person on the FBI's Most Wanted List, after three fugitives on the list were recently caught. A member of the Cuatro Flats gang, Saenz first stepped into police crosshairs in 1998. He was wanted for shooting and killing two rival gang members at a housing complex in the Hollenbeck area of Los Angeles. Then, he was a fresh-faced 22-year-old with a dark side. ""Just gruesome, gruesome, cold-blooded,"" Chavarria said. ""Just walks right up to these guys, shoots them and then just walks over and stands over them and shoots them each in the head and casually walks away."" They knew he was dangerous, and they had to find him. ""We had pictures of him constantly on our dashboard so that there was no question if we saw this guy we knew who he was,"" Chavarria said. Within days, Saenz -- also known as Jose Saenz, Louie Louie and more than two dozen other aliases -- was wanted for a third murder. Investigators said Saenz suspected the mother of his child, Sigreta Hernandez, would turn him in, so he kidnapped, raped and murdered her at his grandmother's house. ""He leaves a note indicating that his grandmother has nothing to do with the murder and that he left the scene. And from that point on he became a fugitive for the next 10 years,"" Gonzales said. FBI Special Agent Scott Garriola believes Saenz graduated from local gangs to international drug trafficking -- crossing the border with falsified documents. ""He's believed to be linked with the cartels in Mexico, bringing large amounts of narcotics into the Los Angeles area, Garriola said. ""And I think the reason for the last crime was a direct relationship to the cartels."" He's eluded police for years, and has reportedly made statements that he plans to kill a police officer if they ever find him and arrest him, according to the FBI's Most Wanted Web site. Now, authorities are hoping the video from October 2008 will help them get one step closer to the man who they say terrifies those who know him just as much as his victims. ""We heard rumors that not only citizens were afraid of him, but also his own gang members were afraid of him,"" Chavarria said. The chilling video, Chavarria said, shows why Saenz is so dangerous. ""It looks like he really enjoys what he does, he enjoys killing people,"" he said.","Joe Saenz wanted in connection with four murders, a kidnapping and a rape .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- In many ways, Josh Stepakoff's childhood came to an abrupt halt at 10:49 a.m. on August 10, 1999. That's the moment a man named Buford Furrow entered the front door of the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles and started shooting. Five people were wounded, including three children. Stepakoff, who was attending summer camp there, had the bad luck to be in the lobby. He took two bullets to his left leg and hip. He was 6 at the time, and is among few people who witnessed the horrific sights and sounds of a mass shooting as a very young child. Like the children of Newtown, Connecticut, he saw blood, he heard screams and he was scared for his life. Shooting triggers 'mind battle' for Columbine victims . The schoolchildren in Connecticut, in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, have a long road ahead of them, says Stepakoff, now 19. He was traumatized for years. ""If we heard helicopters, sirens, loud noises -- anything that would startle me -- the house was on lockdown,"" he said. ""I locked every door. I locked every window."" Even when things were quiet, walking around the house could be stressful, as Stepakoff thought a killer like Furrow might be hiding behind every corner. ""It's not just, 'I'm scared something might pop out at me,' it was, 'I'm scared for my life,'"" Josh remembered in an interview from his parents' home in Los Angeles. Sandy Hook victim's dad praises her short life . Ben Kadish, who was 5 when he was shot just a few feet away from Josh 13 years ago, said he felt scared at school even five years after the shooting, and sleeping at friends' houses was out of the question. ""I couldn't be an average child,"" he said. The intensity of the trauma has dulled with time, the young men say, but the shooting still affects them. For example, both of them chose to go to college in Los Angeles so they wouldn't be far from home when they had a bad moment. ""If I did run into those times, I didn't want to be a plane flight away,"" Stepakoff said. ""I didn't want to be a six-hour car ride away. I wanted to be five minutes away from my home, my safety zone."" Stepakoff and Kadish have insights and advice for the parents of Sandy Hook Elementary children, which can also apply to families whose children have suffered other types of trauma. Shooting victims range in age from 6 to 56 . Let them talk -- or not . ""If I said I didn't want to talk about it, we didn't talk about it,"" Stepakoff remembers. ""If I wanted to talk about it, we talked about it."" Expect your life to be disrupted . When Stepakoff was a young boy and put his house on lockdown, his parents couldn't leave, even if they had to get to work. If they were eating lunch at a restaurant and police officers walked in to dine, the family would have to get up and go, because police reminded him of the shootings. ""My parents were great,"" he said. Allow your child to find his way . As a teenager, Stepakoff decided to do work with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and found solace in talking to other victims. James Zidell, the third child injured in the Los Angeles shooting, took refuge in nature. He was also 6 at the time of the shooting. ""In nature you are surrounded by love and beauty,"" he wrote in a high school English paper he shared with CNN. ""Bad people cannot get me."" Repeat comforting thoughts . James Zidell's mother, Francine Zidell, remembers telling her son over and over that Furrow was in jail and couldn't hurt him anymore. ""That seemed to be what he needed to hear,"" she says. Tell your child how strong he is . Kadish says one of the most helpful things his parents did was to tell him how strong he was to survive such a horrendous event. ""My slogan was, 'You're Ben Kadish and you can do anything,'"" he remembers with a smile. Support crucial for kids after trauma .","Three children were wounded in a 1999 shooting in Los Angeles .

"Finale Emilia, Italy (CNN) -- Thousands of survivors huddled in tents or in their cars under rainy skies early Monday following a weekend earthquake that killed seven people across northern Italy. Aftershocks rattled the country's industrial heartland throughout Sunday evening following the magnitude-6.0 quake that struck around 4 a.m. (10 p.m. Saturday ET). The head of Italy's Civil Protection Department, Franco Gabrielli, said 11,000 people had been displaced after the quake, with the government putting 3,000 of them up in tents or hotels. In Finale Emilia, about 35 km (21 miles) north of Bologna, 75 people were sleeping in cars in a public park. One of them was Filomenna Gatti, who planned to cram into a Fiat Punto with her husband and three children under 6. ""I close my eyes and I see stones falling and I feel the ground shaking when it's still,"" Gatti said as she walked her dog. ""I don't want to be in any building."" Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti was expected to return from the NATO summit in Chicago on Monday, his government announced Sunday. Monti annoucned Sunday he was leaving the conference early, vowing, ""All that is necessary will be done as soon as possible"" to help the survivors. The quake was centered about 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) outside Camposanto, northwest of Bologna, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. In addition to the seven reported fatalities, 50 people were injured in the quake, Gabrielli said. iReport: Watch the earthquake aftermath unfold . The stricken region is part of Italy's industrial heartland, and the dead included two people killed in a ceramics factory in Sant'Agostino di Ferrara, about 30 km from the epicenter, civil protection agency spokeswoman Elisabetta Maffani said. Workers were still digging through rubble in hopes of finding survivors in Sant'Agostino, where the quake knocked down a church bell and a magnitude-4.8 aftershock brought down part of its city hall Sunday evening. ""We have just lost our history. Four generations of my family lived here, and now it's gone,"" 72-year-old Luciano Frendo said as he walked through Finale Emila. ""Our history has collapsed."" The civil protection agency said it expects to get more reports of injuries as rescue workers make their way to remote villages in the mountainous area. Heavy rain was expected to continue into Tuesday after hampering rescue efforts and efforts to spot survivors from the air. Other deaths included one person killed when a work shed collapsed in nearby Ponte Rodoni di Bondeno, Maffani said. In addition, a woman in Bologna died of a heart attack during an evacuation, a Moroccan national died when the factory he was working in collapsed and a sixth victim was found dead under rubble in Sant'Agostino, she said. The body of a seventh victim was located under a collapsed house, according to Alessio Bellodi of the civil protection branch in Bologna. The same area was struck by a 5.3-magnitude quake in January. And a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck near the central Italian city of L'Aquila, more than 400 km to the south, in 2009, killing more than 300 and causing widespread destruction.

"(CNN) -- With at least 1,488 tornadoes and 547 deaths, 2011 has been one for the record books. Although the tools forecasters use are getting better, concerns remain about whether residents have enough accurate information or are heeding warnings. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras, a committee member of the National Weather Association, is attending its annual meeting this week in Birmingham, Alabama, which was battered by the April 27 tornado outbreak in the Deep South. That day and April 28 saw 187 tornadoes, the largest outbreak in U.S. history. About 600 meteorologists, 150 of them in broadcasting, are at the conference. Before coming to CNN in 1999, Jeras provided storm information to viewers of four Midwest TV stations. She spoke Tuesday about warning systems, technology and what you can do to safeguard your family. Q. What are some of the key topics at the meeting? A. The big focus is certainly the tornado outbreak and going back over the data, looking at atmospheric conditions and comparing it to history. With these tornadoes (April 27-28) there was a lot of lead time and warnings. We have been finding that people didn't react right away. A lot of the people did not take to shelters when the alarm went out. There is still a high false alarm rate with tornado warnings. Experts want to know how people in storm areas receive warnings and how they react. Q. What are some lessons from this year of high tornado activity? A. Forecasting continues to get better. We need to improve communication. People need to know the difference between a watch and warning. You can never let your guard down. Some local meteorologists were heroes in this situation. They saved lives, such as James Spann in Birmingham (CNN affiliate WBMA). They can help calmly people get through this. You need to watch the local meteorologist your trust. At a national level, we can educate viewers and readers on what is coming. We are there to provide that advance warning. What happened in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa can happen to you. Q. How did April 27 go, from a forecasting and response perspective? A. The basic consensus is that emergency officials and warning meteorologists did everything right. Warnings were given. Early that morning, there was a huge squall line and it brought terrible wind damage and several tornadoes. There were tens of thousands of people left without power during that time. (Officials) are worried about that loss of power and whether that prevented people getting information they needed. Also, some people thought the early-morning storms were the main event. In this particular outbreak, we saw evidence of the potential for a major outbreak four to five days in advance. The Storm Prediction Center (an arm of NOAA) will issue probabilities of severe events based on models. Three days out for sure they were sending out public information. They knew the bulls-eye was in northern Alabama. People's responses in taking the storm seriously were really heightened based on the tone of the local broadcast meteorologist. They were saying it was Armageddon, and it was. Q. Are there changes in how warnings are going out from the National Weather Service? A. In addition to a tornado warning, a tornado emergency is declared when a tornado is confirmed on the ground. Q. What about false warnings? A. A tornado warning is issued when rotation is shown on Doppler radar or a person or verified storm chaser has actually seen a tornado. How many times do they actually see a tornado out of the rotating storm? We know it is rotating, but we don't why some (storms) drop tornadoes and some don't. People are complacent because there a high percentage of false rates. If it's a rare event in your event in your town, you are probably less likely to that. Warnings are issued on a county-by-county basis. It's up to local officials in the county on whether they will sound the sirens. If a severe thunderstorm enters a county and there is a tornado watch in effect some counties will sound a siren. Others will only sound them when there is a tornado warning. Part of the problem is that there is not a national uniform system on what to trigger. Maybe we need to go to a Zip Code system. We can now share a warning to a small part of the county, called a polygon warning. If they send a siren off for the whole county, it increases the perceptions of false warnings. I think there needs to be another type of warning issued for confirmed tornadoes. Maybe they can pulse it, rather than blaring it. Q. What about the forecasting equipment? A. The National Weather Service is changing its current Doppler radars over to a dual polarimetric Doppler system. (The additional information from vertical radio waves will greatly improve many different types of forecasts and warnings for hazardous weather, the government says.) This radar has a better rate of detection of weaker tornadoes. If you can better detect these, you can reduce false warnings Some bureaus have already been changed over. Q. How has the science changed in your years as a meteorologist? A. Doppler radar revolutionized it. We are making more progress on the science. We can have all the technology in the world, but if we can't communicate it well, or people don't receive it and respond, that is a problem. Q. What else is helping with preparedness? A. Social media is the up and coming thing. More and more people are receiving their information from Twitter, Facebook and mobile devices. Sometimes there is false information sent out, so you have to be careful about source information. But if you have signed up for an app that you trust, such information is very accurate. Also, several of those who lost power during the tornadoes said they turned to social media to receive their information. Q. What can an individual do? A. Preparedness is the key to this. People need to be prepared all year round, especially for the loss of power. Have a NOAA radio with batteries that are fresh. A survey has shown very low percentage of people get information from weather radios. I have tried to remind viewers that it is available. You need to be educated on whether you are at risk, if today is going to be a tornado day. Where is my safe place? It is the lowest level of your home, away from windows. Cover yourself up. If you are outdoors, you need to know if there is a risk of storms. Know where there is a sturdy building with a bathroom. Where am I going to evacuate? You need to take that responsibility.","Jeras: There is still a high false alarm rate with tornado warnings .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A North Georgia man is charged with murder after authorities say he put vodka in his 4-month-old's baby bottle, leading to her death -- an incident that his public defender says was an accident. The infant girl died June 8, 2011, after she drank the vodka. Just over a year later, a DeKalb County grand jury indicted her father, Keith Antonine Furlow, on felony murder and second-degree cruelty to children, according to the court document filed Thursday. ""We're at a point where we are just pursuing justice for this infant little girl,"" District Attorney Robert James told HLN's Nancy Grace on Friday. James earlier told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB that authorities don't see any way the baby could have consumed the vodka, unless it was given to her by the now 20-year-old Furlow. ""Obviously, at that age, a child isn't old enough to get up and go pick up a bottle herself. Children at four months old are fed whatever it is they consume,"" the district attorney said. ""So the evidence, we believe, would show that he actually fed this baby the vodka."" Furlow, of Stone Mountain, a community about 15 miles east of Atlanta, has not yet been formally arraigned on the charges. When that happens, he will plead not guilty, according to Corinne Mull, an attorney with the DeKalb County Public Defender's Office representing him. ""Everything isn't always as it seems,"" Mull said Friday in defense of her court-appointed client. ""Accidents happen."" The district attorney explained Friday that Furlow is being charged with felony murder because he is accused of killing his daughter while committing child cruelty. The latter charge states that Furlow, ""with criminal negligence, caused ... cruel and excessive physical pain by feeding a four month old an alcoholic beverage,"" according to the indictment. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Keith Furlow, 20, is charged with felony murder and cruelty to children .

"(CNN) -- A uniformed Philadelphia police officer seen in an online video striking a woman after he was hit by a liquid has been placed on administrative duty while the incident is investigated, a police spokeswoman said Tuesday. The officer seen in the video, which was posted on YouTube, was identified as Lt. Jonathan Josey, Philadelphia police spokeswoman Christine O'Brien told CNN. The video shows a crowd of people gathered around about a dozen officers handcuffing a man against a car at the annual Puerto Rican Day Parade on Sunday. The woman, wearing a black shirt and jeans, is on the left side of the video and has a bottle in her left hand. The woman raises her left arm as she hops around behind one of the officers. Some liquid flies from the bottle at the police. The woman changes position and a man behind her tosses liquid at the police. As the woman turns and retreats, an officer, now identified as Josey, walks quickly after her and appears to strike her in the face with his right hand. The woman is knocked to the ground. Josey cuffs her and two other officers lead her away. She appears to have blood coming from her mouth. Lt. Ray Evers, a spokesman for Philadelphia police, said the woman was charged with disorderly conduct. Police didn't release the name of the woman. Police asked witnesses who were at the parade to call 215-685-5056. The video had 785,000 views and 6,000 comments by Tuesday afternoon.","NEW: The officer who hit the woman is Lt.

"(CNN) -- Syrian opposition activists spoke Tuesday of being past the point of no return in their struggle against the al-Assad regime, which stepped up its siege on the city of Homs and reportedly launched fresh attacks across the country. At least 49 people were killed, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The deaths included three defected Syrian soldiers, the group said. Deaths took place in Idlib, Homs, Daraa, Aleppo, Deir Ezzor, Hama, Damascus, the Damascus suburbs and Latakia, the group said. Fear and horror paralyzed residents of Homs, which was struck by heavy shelling; snipers prevented people from walking in the streets, opposition activists said. ""The snipers are even targeting those who intend to get bread from the bakeries,"" said one activist, who uses the pseudonym Abu Omar. ""They are shelling randomly -- why, I don't know,"" said another activist, identified only as Omar for security reasons. ""There is no place here in this city that is a safe house or shelter or a basement. You have to be lucky to stay safe."" Tuesday's shelling was among the heaviest in the past five days, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. While United Nations diplomats reiterated their denunciations of the Syrian regime for the mounting bloodshed, residents wondered what lay ahead. ""Everyone we've been talking to ... believes that the country is heading toward, or already is in, a full-blown war, and recovering from that is going to be incredibly challenging,"" said CNN's Arwa Damon, who reported from inside Syria on Tuesday. She spoke from an opposition safe house. CNN is not disclosing her location because of concerns for her safety. Logistical challenges are challenging; some living rooms are serving as makeshift triage clinics, she said. ""Villagers have tried to gather medical supplies and blood to move them into these hard-hit areas and for days have been unable to do so"" because of the government crackdown, she said. Members of the opposition believe it is a fight to the death and, if they fail, the government will kill them, Damon reported. Many, she said, would be willing to accept assistance even from Israel, a sworn enemy. Her reports came a day after the U.N. high commissioner for human rights denounced the Syrian government's ""ongoing onslaught"" against its citizens. Navi Pillay spoke before the U.N. General Assembly, which could issue a formal condemnation of the Syrian regime. ""The nature and scale of abuses committed by Syrian forces indicates that crimes against humanity are likely to have been committed since March 2011,"" Pillay said. Syria posted a banner on state TV Tuesday saying its foreign affairs ministry ""absolutely rejects all the new allegations in the new report by the human rights high commissioner."" Syria also rejected decisions made over the weekend during a meeting of the Arab League. The league proposed a joint U.N.-Arab peacekeeping force and urged member states to provide political and financial support to the Syrian opposition and to cut ties with Damascus. SANA quoted ""an official source"" Tuesday as calling the league meetings a ""blatant interference in (Syria's) internal affairs and an encroachment on its national sovereignty."" The Syrian government said on the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency that 13 ""army and law enforcement martyrs"" were buried Tuesday. ""The martyrs were killed in the line of duty by armed terrorists groups in Damascus Countryside, Homs and Idlib."" SANA also reported that large crowds gathered in Latakia in support of the government's ""reform process, rejecting foreign interference,"" and denouncing ""terrorist bombings"" in Aleppo. Two government buildings were bombed last week in the city, killing 28 people, Syrian officials said. Syria has cited the incident as evidence that al Qaeda is active in the country. A U.N. General Assembly draft resolution that would condemn Syrian human rights violations has been discussed by diplomats but not introduced. Though a General Assembly vote would not be binding, it would mark the strongest U.N. statement yet on the violence. Russia and China have vetoed attempts to condemn Syria for the crackdown by the U.N. Security Council, whose resolutions are binding. The draft G.A. resolution calls on Syria to end human-rights violations and attacks against civilians immediately, and condemns ""all violence, irrespective of where it comes from."" U.S. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden welcomed Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, that nation's presumptive next premier, to the White House. Speaking of Syria and the recent U.N. debate, Biden said at a news conference, ""While the United States and China ... will not always see eye to eye, it is a sign of the strength and maturity of our relationship that we can be candid about our differences as we have been."" Victoria Nuland, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday that increasing pressure and sanctions on President Bashar al-Assad's government was crucial. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe announced a national decision to establish an emergency relief fund for Syria, according to a statement posted on the website of the permanent mission of France to the U.N. The fund, with an initial sum of 1 million euros, will ""fund the actions of all organizations and associations wishing to help the Syrian people."" France will propose the creation of a similar fund at the international level at the first ""Friends of Syria"" meeting in Tunis on February 24, the statement said. European Union diplomats told CNN they expect new EU sanctions on Syria by February 27, targeting the Syrian Central Bank and imposing a ban on exports of precious metals and phosphates. More than 700 people have been killed over the past 10 days in Syria, mostly in Homs, the Local Coordination Committees said. A video posted Friday on YouTube shows a child running down a street while gunfire is heard. A man runs into the street, picks up the child and takes him to safety near a building. The man then runs back into the street, apparently to get the child's shoe. Voices can be heard chanting, ""God is great"" and ""We have no one but you, God, for help."" A voice on the recording says the incident occurred in the al-Balad neighborhood of Daraa. Another video on YouTube shows tanks and civilians standing next to each other in a Damascus suburb. An opposition activist has said government forces are using detained civilians as human shields, placing them on tanks to prevent the opposition Free Syrian Army from fighting back. CNN cannot independently confirm details of the events in Syria because the government has severely limited the access of international journalists. Damon said every person she interviewed had a horror story to tell. ""One man we met, he had four members of his family executed as government forces, he said, were raiding their village,"" she said. She said some members of the opposition believe the regime will fall, but don't know how many more lives will be lost before that happens. ""If there is military intervention, then yes, there will be a lot of bloodshed, but it's going to be over a lot quicker,"" one activist said. ""If there isn't military intervention, there is going to be even more bloodshed, and it's going to take a lot longer to bring down the regime."" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Hamdi Alkhshali, Nada Husseini, Mick Krever, Richard Roth, Saad Abedine, Talia Kayali, Holly Yan, Elise Labott and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","At least 49 people died Tuesday, opposition group says .

"(CNN) -- ""Like a square peg going into a round hole."" That's how Mark John, an Idaho man who spotted and helped lead authorities to James DiMaggio and 16-year-old Hannah Anderson, described the pair. DiMaggio is now dead, shot and killed by an FBI agent in the Idaho wilderness. He was suspected in the slayings of Hannah's mother and brother in California and in the girl's kidnapping. ""They were just like a square peg going into a round hole. They didn't fit. He might have been an outdoorsman in California, but he was not an outdoorsman in Idaho,"" John told reporters Sunday. ""He just didn't fit."" John, his wife, Christa, and another couple, Mike and Mary Young, were out on horseback when they happened upon DiMaggio and Hannah on Wednesday twice, once on a trail and once at a lake. Red flags went up immediately. All their gear looked brand new, said John. They had no rain equipment. Another flag, said Mike Young, was that DiMaggio said he was headed for the Salmon River, but was going in the wrong direction. Hannah hid her face and looked kind of scared, he said. Young and the others thought that maybe their horses had frightened her. She and DiMaggio were hiking. He had a backpack. She was wearing what looked like either sweatpants or pajamas, Young said. He noticed they had a two-man tent set up in a ridge. Another red flag. The camping spot had no water, and a tent on a ridge would act like a ""lightning rod,"" Young said. ""Usually when you meet people in the back country, you have a pretty good encounter, you know, and talk about where they've been and where they're going. But they didn't want to talk,"" he told reporters. After their group passed DiMaggio and Hannah, he turned to the others and said he thought something wasn't right. ""Just kind of a gut feeling, you know, like they didn't belong,"" said Young. 'One chance in a trillion' Their group ran into DiMaggio and Hannah later at a lake. The girl was soaking her feet in the water, and DiMaggio was off to the side petting a gray cat, said John. Just as he and the others were getting ready to go, Hannah said something that made little sense at the time. ""She said, 'Looks like we're all in trouble now,' or 'We're in real trouble now,'"" said John. ""I thought it extremely strange."" No one in his group was aware of the massive manhunt under way. Hannah had been missing since August 3. The bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, and 8-year-old brother, Ethan, were found one day later in DiMaggio's burned house in San Diego County, California. But eventually, John, a former county sheriff and retired Army officer, called police. After he and his wife got home Thursday, he turned on the television and saw an Amber Alert for Hannah. She looked like the girl they'd just seen. ""For us to be there at the precise time to interact with them -- it's one chance in a trillion,"" Christa John said. Her husband's call set off a series of events that ended late Saturday in DiMaggio's death and Hannah's rescue. Hundreds of law enforcement agents scoured 300 square miles of rough terrain, hampered by the smoke from nearby wildfires. They spotted the pair's campsite near Morehead Lake, Idaho. The topography was so steep that helicopters had to drop authorities off far away from the camp. Hostage rescue teams hiked more than two hours to get to the scene. Authorities ushered Hannah to an area where a helicopter could whisk her away. At some point, a ""confrontation"" ensued between authorities and DiMaggio, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said. An FBI tactical agent shot and killed the murder and kidnapping suspect. Andrea Dearden, spokeswoman for Idaho's Ada County sheriff's office, praised the horseback riders Sunday, hailing their contribution to the case as critical. ""It was because of their tip to law enforcement ... that we knew where to go, and we knew where to look,"" she said. CNN's Greg Botelho and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's one chance in a trillion,"" says one rider .

"Houston (CNN) -- Back in 1982, Chelsea McClellan -- just 15 months old -- needed immunizations. It was routine stuff, so Chelsea's mother took her to a local clinic in Kerrville, Texas. What happened there was anything but routine. That's because Genene Jones was the nurse on duty. Chelsea's mother recalled the day. ""She gave her her first shot in her left thigh and she immediately started gasping for air,"" said Petti McClellan-Wiese. ""Gave her another one, and she immediately just went limp and quit breathing."" In the chaos of rushing Chelsea from the clinic to the hospital, Jones somehow slipped into the ambulance and gave the little girl a third shot. McClellan-Wiese would learn later that the nurse had injected her daughter with a drug called Succinylcholine, which causes muscle relaxation and short term paralysis. It stopped Chelsea's heart. Jones was convicted of infanticide and sentenced to 99 years in prison for killing Chelsea, plus 60 years for injuring another child. She maintains that she did nothing wrong. For Chelsea's parents, the verdict was bitter sweet. Their daughter was gone but her killer would spend the rest of her life behind bars. At least that's what they thought. But it turns out, Jones is set to walk free in a matter of a few years. She is scheduled to be released from prison as early as May 2018 because of an old Texas law designed to prevent prison overcrowding. The Mandatory Release law allows inmates convicted of violent crimes between 1977 and 1987 to be automatically released if their ""good behavior"" credit plus their time served equals their sentence. The law was changed in 1987 to exclude violent criminals, but it isn't retroactive. So now McClellan-Wiese and Andy Kahan, a victim's advocate for the city of Houston, are desperately trying to find other mothers whose babies may also have been killed by Jones. A new conviction could keep her locked up. Kahan says that two mothers have already reached out to him, including Marina Rodriguez. Rodriguez lost her son in 1981 after, she says, Jones gave him a shot at a San Antonio clinic. At just 5 months old, he had a heart attack and died. ""All of a sudden he turned blue, and all of a sudden, I started hearing code blue. And then of course they put me to the side because I'm a young mommy and I'm freaking out,"" she said. Back then, Rodriguez was 15 years old. She couldn't read and was too young to afford a lawyer. Her parents were migrant farmers. When asked how she would feel if Jones were to walk free, she said she couldn't contemplate the possibility. ""She's not getting out! She's not going to get out! If my son has to be exhumed to prove that she murdered him, then that's the step we'll take. They're not dealing with a little girl anymore, this is a woman now,"" Rodriguez said.

"(CNN) -- ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" follows the life of Cecil Gaines, an African-American butler who serves in the White House under eight presidencies. Inspired by real-life butler Eugene Allen, Gaines (played by Forest Whitaker) witnesses the rise of the civil rights movement, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, Vietnam and the election of the Barack Obama, all while simultaneously balancing the highs and lows of his family life. Tracing the evolution of 20th century American society through the lens of one man's life, this passion project from director Lee Daniels and screenwriter Danny Strong drew Hollywood's top talent. Along with Whitaker -- Oprah Winfrey, David Oyelowo, Cuba Gooding Jr., Lenny Kravitz, Mariah Carey, Terrence Howard, James Marsden, Robin Williams and more signed on to the film. The star-studded cast opened up to CNN about what it took to make one of summer's most buzzed about movies, and revealed the behind-the-scenes secrets on the set of ""The Butler."" Set secret No. 1: Lee Daniels despises his name in the film's title . Following an extensive battle with the MPAA over the movie's original title ""The Butler,"" also the name of a 1916 short, Lee Daniels reluctantly agreed to differentiate his film by using the title ""Lee Daniels' the Butler."" Yet the director admits he doesn't like seeing his name on the marquee, and says the title change broke his heart. ""I do work for kids that are impoverished, that come from where I come from, which is the projects, and I don't want them to feel that your name is more important than your work,"" Daniels said. ""I don't feel comfortable with it. I don't feel like I'm Martin Scorsese, or Quentin Tarantino. I'm just a filmmaker trying to tell a story."" Set secret No. 2: Cuba Gooding Jr. was up for the role of Cecil Gaines . Cuba Gooding Jr. once eyed the role of leading man Cecil Gaines, and even did a screen test for the part before Forest Whitaker was cast as the butler. ""But after watching the movie,"" Gooding Jr. said, ""I could not picture anybody else other than Forest Whitaker."" Set secret No. 3: Terrence Howard avoided looking 'too pretty' by removing a fake tooth . Daniels wanted to cast his pal Terrence Howard in ""The Butler,"" but thought he was ""too pretty"" for the role of Gaines' feisty neighbor. That is, until Howard removed a fake tooth he's had for 25 years to toughen up for the part. ""Lee called me and he was like, 'TT, I'm having trouble. I want to put you in this movie, but I can't now. There's this one character left but you're too pretty for him. I don't know what to do!' "" Howard recalled. ""And he's like, 'Can we cut your hair off or maybe give you an eye patch or a scar or something?' And I was like, 'You know what, I got a crown on this front tooth, you know, I can take that out.' He's like, 'Don't you do it! Don't you do it! ... I'll set up a dentist appointment right away!'"" Set secret No. 4: Cuba Gooding Jr. jumped into a pool sans swimsuit at a 'Butler' kick-off party . Daniels says his lips are sealed about many of the behind-the-scenes moments on the set of ""The Butler."" Yet he does indulge in one story about a raucous launch party. ""Cuba, Cuba ... "" Daniels reminisced. ""At our opening party for the cast, Oprah was there and everybody was there, and Cuba decided to jump into the pool naked. Let's just say that was the beginning of ""The Butler."" Oh, ""Lee Daniels' The Butler."" Set secret No. 5: Oprah Winfrey took Daniels' direction with a smile ... until he asked her to get into her underwear . Daniels said he felt very protective of Oprah Winfrey on the set, as she readily took his direction and allowed herself to become vulnerable. But the duo did clash once: when Daniels asked the Big O to bare it all. ""I had her in her bra and panties,"" Daniels said. ""She was like 'No!' And I said 'Oh, OK.' I would have fought her on it, but the only reason why I didn't is because it was a PG-13 movie. 'You win.' "" Set secret No. 6: Terrence Howard thinks he and Oprah have chemistry . Terrence Howard and Oprah Winfrey share a hot and heavy scene in ""The Butler,"" and Howard brags they teamed up well on screen because they have chemistry in real life too. Making out with Oprah, he said, is ""the greatest dream for any man. A guy can get the prom queen, but to get Miss America or get Miss Universe? That's the notch in the belt."" But really, he insists, ""She was into me! She had to approve me in that role. You're not going to pick somebody to kiss and have a closeness like that with, that you don't have a potential attraction for!"" Set secret No. 7: James Marsden faced incredible pressure to get his JFK accent right . To prep for the enormous task of playing John F. Kennedy, James Marsden kept podcasts of the president's iconic speeches on his iPod, which he listened to as he went to sleep. The actor said getting the accent right was crucial in accurately portraying Kennedy. ""That was a really defining part of Jack: his accent,"" Marsden said. ""It wasn't necessarily Boston -- it was a little bit of New York, it was all these things mixed in. It was the Kennedy accent. And I knew that was going to be the barometer by which you're measured. And then beyond that you just hope to bring something else that you might not have ever seen -- capture sort of his essence, his intelligence, his charm. But I knew that all those other pieces would not have fallen into place if you did not have the accent."" Set secret No. 8: Yaya Alafia nearly vomited after being spit on during a dinner sit-in scene . When Yaya Alafia played a black college student engaged in a sit-in at an all-white lunch counter, she was actually spit on by another actress during filming. Alafia reveals she had an overwhelming reaction to the degradation. ""The things that happen in the body when something like that happens in real life happened on set. You're acting, it's make believe, but the lines get blurry in scenes like that. Especially when you're using real saliva,"" Alafia said. ""I actually had to jump up after cut, run out to the street and get some fresh air. I thought I was gonna vomit. I just gagged a bunch and washed my face probably four times. It took a while energetically to cleanse as well. But it was always great to remind ourselves as difficult as this was, it was nothing compared to the people that really sat at these lunch counters and endured this time and again, and again, and again. They couldn't go back to their hotel rooms and just shake it off. There was no cut."" Set secret No. 9: Forest Whitaker referenced high-profile news stories to play Cecil Gaines . Whitaker said he examined today's racially charged cases, and internalized these stories, to get better into the mindset of his character. ""I had to take this whole shape of history and make it a part of myself personally,"" Whitaker said. ""To be able to take these experiences we're experiencing today; what people are feeling about Trayvon Martin or Oscar Grant. These things are affecting people and they're affecting their lives and their souls. We have to remember when you talk about 'The Butler,' we're talking about the civil rights movement, which is continuing. It's a living history, it's not a dead history."" Set secret No. 10: The movie portrays a first in Hollywood history . While ""Lee Daniels' the Butler"" chronicles the evolution of the civil rights movement throughout the 20th century, it is also a story about family. With the film, screenwriter Danny Strong strove to portray African-American families in a way that Hollywood has historically ignored. ""We don't (usually) see the black family in this situation; intact and loving and talking, and being. We don't see that on the screen,"" Strong said. ""I had a moment with Lee in the editing room; we were watching the scene where they send Louis (David Oyelowo) away to college and he turned to me and said, 'Never in the history of cinema has there been a scene of a black family sending their kid off to college.' He said, 'You should be really proud of yourself.' And I started to tear up.""

"(CNN) -- It's been billed as an astronomical equivalent of the Large Hadron Collider, offering new insights into the formation of the universe and so powerful that it might even detect alien life. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is an international effort to build the world's largest radio telescope, one which will probe the dark heart of space shedding new light on dark matter, black holes, stars and galaxies. ""It will have a deep impact on the way we perceive our place in the universe and how we understand its history and its future,"" says Michiel van Haarlem, interim director general of the SKA project. ""We know we are going to discover things that we haven't already. It's going to be very exciting,"" van Haarlem said. Taking its name from the total size of its collecting area, the SKA telescope will consist of 3,000 dish antennas, each one around 15 meters wide. Construction is slated to begin in 2016. Collectively the surface area of all the dishes will amount to one square kilometer -- hence the name -- all combining to detect radio waves that penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, emitted by stars, galaxies and quasars. Two other types of radio receptors -- aperture antennas and array antennas -- will combine with the dishes to provide continuous frequency coverage from 70 MHz to 10 GHz. ""It's not like an optical telescope where you see an image of the sky directly. What you do is measure signals from the antennas and process them,"" van Haarlem says. Around half the antennas will sit in a ""central core region"" made up of three separate five-kilometer clusters. The remainder will extend out in five carefully aligned ""spiral arms"" stretching out ever more sparsely over an area in excess of 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) or more. The configuration, say scientists, will create the most sensitive radio telescope ever built. Currently, that honor is held by the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, says Alastair Edge, from Durham University -- a leading UK center for astronomical research. ""(VLA has) just undergone a very large refit. Telescopes themselves haven't changed but the computing at the back end has changed dramatically,"" Edge said. See also: Mapping out a new era in brain research . At the moment, we simply don't have the computing power for the SKA telescope to perform at full tilt, Edge says. Van Haarlem concurs. ""We're talking about huge computing hardware that still needs to be developed. There's a big challenge there,"" he said. Supercomputers capable of performing billions and billions of operations per second will be required, but the results will be spectacular, van Haarlem says. ""We will have high-resolution images where we will actually peer into the center of what is going on in galaxies,"" van Haarlem said. ""We will also have the big picture where we can make surveys of vast areas of the sky to map out the large-scale structure of the universe."" The project is entering a crucial stage with an announcement on where the array will be based expected imminently. Two locations, one in South Africa's Northern Cape, the other in western Australia, are in the running. Brian Boyle, project director of the Australia/New Zealand bid, extols the virtues of Western Australia's ""intrinsic radio quietness"" and the ""excellent geophysics"" of the proposed Australian site. Meanwhile, SKA South Africa project director Bernie Fanaroff says hosting the ""world's largest science project"" would be extremely important to the country and the continent. ""It could carry immense importance for the perception of Africa -- by Africans and by the rest of the world,"" Fanaroff said. ""It has already attracted a lot of young people into science and mathematics in South Africa and from other African countries and it's attracted a lot of top-rate scientists,"" he added. Recent reports suggest that South Africa is favorite to host the SKA, but van Haarlem wouldn't be drawn on the matter. Wherever the location, the effort to build and operate the SKA will be an international one, with 20 countries and 70 institutions already on board, as well as private backers. And whatever the outcome of the bids, it will be a while before the array is up and running with construction slated to start four years from now and full operation not expected until 2024. The total cost is estimated at â‚¬1.5 billion (around $2 billion). But it will be money well spent van Haarlem thinks. ""If it only tells us when the first stars and galaxies formed then it would have already contributed a huge amount to our understanding."" Alastair Edge agrees. ""It is possibly the most complex experiment we could possibly do. It has huge potential for allowing us to determine the distance to every galaxy in our local universe,"" Edge said. ""The Large Hadron Collider produces a certain amount of data per hour. This will produce the same amount of data in the space of a couple of minutes.""","The world's largest radio telescope will uncover secrets of the history and future of the universe .

"(CNN) -- An American student fatally stabbed in Egypt was so fascinated with the region, he read poems about it to his girlfriend, his mother said. Andrew Pochter of Chevy Chase, Maryland, was stabbed Friday in the port city of Alexandria. He was in the country teaching English to elementary school children. ""As we understand it, he was witnessing the protest as a bystander and was stabbed by a protester,"" his family said in a statement. ""He went to Egypt because he cared profoundly about the Middle East, and he planned to live and work there in the pursuit of peace and understanding."" Egyptian state media reported that he was stabbed in the chest while filming the protests. Protests have raged for days between supporters and foes of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, prompting the United States to recently warn its citizens against travel to the nation. Poetry about the region . The 21-year-old went to Egypt this year after spending time in Morocco and falling in love with the region. Before the trip, he interned for AMIDEAST, an American nonprofit that focuses on the Middle East and North Africa. He also took a class in regional politics. While enrolled in the class, he read poems about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to his girlfriend, said his mother, Elizabeth Pochter. ""The class wasn't just about some detached war to him, but a struggle that he passionately wanted to resolve,"" she said, according to a statement by Kenyon College, where he had just completed his sophomore year. ""Andrew was a person who didn't see the world as separate nations, but a collection of vibrant cultures."" Governments issue warnings against travel to Egypt . 'One of the rare kids' His goal was to understand the political and religious dynamics in the region, sharpen his Arabic skills and learn the different dialects, according to his family. ""He was one of the rare kids who lived what he believed,"" said Marc Bragin, a chaplain at Kenyon. ""His belief was that everyone should be included, everyone had a voice, and no one should be left out because what they think is different than what others think."" Rugby player, radio station host . A religious studies major, Pochter was raised in a Christian and Jewish household, and was a member of the Middle Eastern Students Association. He was headed into his junior year in college. After Egypt and Morocco, he planned to venture farther into the region, including a planned trip to Amman, Jordan. ""In an essay as part of his application for the study-abroad program in Jordan, Andrew ... reflected on his hopes to develop 'life-long ties ... with Arab-speaking friends,' "" the college said in a statement. Pochter, a college radio station host, had varied interests, including rugby and cooking, his mother said. Kenyon College said it was planning a memorial service in the fall. In addition to his mother, Pochter is survived by his father, Theodore Pochter, and sister, Emily Pochter .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is being investigated for alleged ""systemic"" civil rights violations during routine traffic stops by trying to identify people who live in publicly subsidized housing, federal officials said Friday. The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a civil investigation into the alleged discriminatory policing by the sheriff's deputies in the cities of Lancaster and Palmdale, both in the Mojave Desert's Antelope Valley, federal officials said. Deputies from sheriff stations in those two communities also allegedly conducted warrantless searches of African-American families' homes under the auspices of a housing authority compliance inspection, and housing authority investigators based at the two stations allegedly accompanied deputies during the compliance checks, federal officials said. Sometimes, the deputies allegedly approached the home of a recipient of what is known as Section 8 subsidies ""with guns drawn and in full SWAT armor,"" conducted searches and asked questions unrelated to housing programs, Justice Department officials said. The Justice Department inquiry will focus on whether the two sheriff stations ""engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of race or national origin,"" federal officials said. ""In interviews with affected individuals and community representatives, we heard troubling accounts of allegedly unjustified stops and searches,"" Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez said in a statement. ""We will be investigating whether there is a pattern of racially motivated stops and arrests,"" Perez said. ""We intend to peel the onion to its core, and gain a precise understanding of what is happening in these two areas."" Sheriff Leroy D. Baca appeared at the news conference Friday with Perez in downtown Los Angeles and said his department is cooperating with the investigation. ""We are not going to enforce the laws on the backs of the poor who are in effect obeying the law,"" the sheriff said. The Antelope Valley has experienced explosive population growth over the past two decades, and African-Americans and Latinos now make up almost 60 percent of Lancaster and almost 70 percent of Palmdale, Perez said. Justice Department officials will also look at whether leaders in the two communities ""adopted a policy or practice designed to drive certain residents out of the community,"" Perez said. The cities of Lancaster and Palmdale don't have their own police forces, and they contract with the sheriff, Perez said. Federal authorities will investigate allegations of deputies working alongside city officials, Perez said. Palmdale City Hall was closed Friday, and officials there and in the city of Lancaster couldn't be reached immediately for comment. The sheriff stations in those communities show disproportionately high rates of misdemeanor and obstruction arrests in comparison with other stations, federal officials said. Also, the two cities have ""unusually high rates of misdemeanor arrests and particularly high rates of arrests of African-Americans,"" Perez said. The federal inquiry is being carried out under a police reform provision enacted in the wake of the Los Angeles police beating of Rodney King in 1991, and the Justice Department now has the authority to investigate ""patterns or practices of the deprivation of constitutional rights or violations of federal law,"" Perez said. In a recent e-mailed letter to the sheriff, Perez wrote that the Justice Department will conduct its inquiry in conjunction with another ongoing investigation begun in June into allegations that the cities of Palmdale and Lancaster violated the Fair Housing Act. The Los Angeles County Housing Authority is also being investigated for an alleged ""systematic effort to discriminate against African-Americans and Latinos,"" federal officials said.

"(EW.com) -- At a time when the budgets for sci-fi films are, like the universe itself, expanding at an astronomical rate, Riddick decides to go small. The franchise's third entry shrinks back from the baroque, byzantine space opera of 2004's ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" placing Vin Diesel's interstellar criminal in a story that's more similar in scope to the series' first film, the smart and stylish ""Pitch Black"" (2000). Abandoned on a sere, hostile planet, the laconic antihero subsists off the meager landscape like a muscle-bound Robinson Crusoe until an ensemble of bounty hunters and soldiers (including ""Battlestar Galactica's"" Katee Sackhoff) arrive looking to put his head â€” with those superpowered, see-in-the-dark eyes â€” in a box. Riddick, co-written and directed by David Twohy, scavenges a variety of genres for parts, morphing over the course of its run time from survival story to slasher film (as Riddick hunts his hunters one by one) to a climactic Aliens-esque siege by slithery, slavering creatures. Twohy succeeds in staging moments both tense and funny, but they're fewer and farther between than one would hope, and the dialogue is served up with a heaping helping of cheese, especially when delivered in Diesel's low-frequency growl. Still, by aiming more for suspense than bombast, the modest intentions of this threequel make its failures appear more modest as well. Grade: C+ . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Announcement of a Nintendo 2DS handheld console is causing a collective ""eh"" among fans of the pioneering gaming company. The new console hopes to entice the entry-level gamer (i.e. kids) with a large catalog of games designed for the Nintendo 3DS and DS while appealing to parents with a low price point ($129). Unlike its counterpart, the 2DS does not have 3-D visual effects, nor can it be folded shut like other DS handheld consoles. Instead, the 2DS remains flat and fixed, much like a tablet. The controls are similar to other Nintendo handheld consoles and screen sizes are the same as the 3DS unit. While critics are split over whether this is a good idea for the company in the long term, fans in forums and social media are shaking their heads. Some are asking why a 2DS model is needed when 3-D can be turned off on the current console, while others are calling for Nintendo executives' heads. Much of the confusion lies in the naming convention. While the Nintendo DS can only play DS games, the 2DS and 3DS can play games designed for the DS or the 3DS. The problem arises because the games are clearly labeled for the DS or the 3DS, but not for the 2DS, and could have parents wondering, ""Where are the 2DS games?"" It was a similar problem when the Wii U was announced and players couldn't play Wii U on Wii systems. The names weren't distinct enough to create separation for a casual audience. The move to a non3-D environment for the handheld console is a welcome one to some fans. ""Oh I'm so happy they're creating a 2DS,"" said @omglazerkittens on Twitter. ""That's the whole reason I haven't bought one yet."" Nintendo, for its part, has said the new device is designed for young kids, despite having promotional videos with adults using it. Despite the nonplussed reaction from many older gamers, some fans understand the need for a device aimed at the young audience. The new console may appeal to ""parents who want to buy their kids PokÃ©mon and a 3DS at an affordable price,"" wrote Haziq, a member of popular online video-gaming forum NeoGAF. ""Plus, the flat design kind of reminds me of a tablet. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Nintendo's way of directly competing with that market for small kids."" The October 12 release for the Nintendo 2DS is the same day the company plans to launch the latest titles in the Pokemon universe, ""Pokemon X"" and ""Pokemon Y."" But other gamers aren't so quick to accept the need for the new console or Nintendo's explanation. ""To those who say the 2DS is a kid-friendly option, where does the inability to protect the screen with folding fall into that?"" wrote @JustinMcElroy on Twitter. Twitter user @kellyherron27 wonders whether Nintendo is not happy with the 3DS market anymore. ""Feels like they're saying, 'OK, so our novelty really is a gimmick. Oops.' "" But in explaining the need for the Nintendo 2DS, another NeoGAF member may have offered the most clear-eyed assessment. ""Parents will be buying this for kids and that's the point, hence the price,"" wrote Alpha_eX. ""They're aiming at kids wanting the new PokÃ©mon game and if parents can get it cheap, it'll sell over a more expensive 3DS model."" ""This console isn't aimed at any of us (adults).""","Many gamers appear less than excited about Nintendo's forthcoming 2DS console .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Deliberations were suspended for the night Thursday in the court-martial of the Army psychiatrist charged with massacring soldiers at Fort Hood. The jury will continue weighing the fate Friday morning of Maj. Nidal Hasan, who is charged with 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in the November 5, 2009, shooting rampage. The only real question likely facing the jury is Hasan's degree of guilt, given that he told the court during opening arguments that the evidence would clearly show he was the shooter. Court reconvened briefly Thursday evening after the jury said it had two questions. Jurors asked to have police officer Mark Todd's testimony read back to them and asked to see a map of buildings at Fort Hood. The jury of 13 military officers began deliberations after Hasan declined to make a statement during closing arguments. The prosecution urged the jury to convict, saying the evidence showed he believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible. ""The defense chooses not to make a closing statement,"" Hasan told the court, refusing to challenge any of the evidence presented during 13 days of testimony in the court-martial. If the jury of 13 senior officers unanimously convicts Hasan of two or more counts of premeditated murder, he faces a possible death sentence in the penalty phase. ""There is no doubt, as I said in the beginning, the accused is the shooter,"" the prosecutor, Col. Steven Henricks, told the jury. ""The only question for you is ...is this a premeditated design to kill?"" For more than 90 minutes, the prosecutor took the jury methodically through the evidence in the case, meticulously piecing together how they say Hasan prepared and planned for an attack at a deployment processing center for soldiers deploying to Afghanistan and Iraq. Prosecutors have maintained the American-born Muslim underwent a progressive radicalization that led to the massacre at the sprawling central Texas base. ""He did not want to deploy, and he came to believe he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" Henricks told the jury. Hasan picked the day -- November 5, 2009 -- because it was when the units he was scheduled to deploy with to Afghanistan were scheduled to go through the processing center, he said. Hasan, who has been acting as his own attorney, rested his case without calling a single witness or taking the stand to testify on his own behalf. His decision not to offer a defense was an anticlimactic end to the trial in which prosecution witnesses, primarily survivors, painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside a processing center during the attack. During closing arguments, prosecutors showed a graphic FBI video of the crime scene hours after the rampage, where bodies, blood and bullets still covered the floor. As the video was shown to the jury, some of the family members of those killed fought back tears. One woman laid her head on her husband's shoulder, tears pouring down her cheeks, while another woman -- a wife of a victim -- left the courtroom. For his part, Hasan watched the video, appearing to pay close attention. Hasan, who has insisted that the jury not be allowed to consider lesser charges against him, said his attack on soldiers at Fort Hood was not an act of ""sudden passion."" There was ""adequate provocation"" for the attack because the soldiers were going to participate in ""an illegal war"" in Afghanistan, Hasan told the military judge Wednesday, arguing against the jury being allowed to consider voluntary manslaughter or unpremeditated murder. Prosecutors argued against the inclusion of lesser charges, saying the attack wasn't carried out in ""the heat of sudden passion,"" and Hasan said he agreed. Hasan rests case, calls no witnesses . Much has been made of Hasan's defense or, as his stand-by attorneys have said, the lack of it. Judge Tara Osborn declined a request by Hasan's attorneys to drop out of the case. The attorneys argued that Hasan was helping the prosecution put him to death. There may be something to that claim. Hasan took credit for the shooting rampage at the outset of the trial, telling the jury during opening statements that the evidence will show ""I was the shooter."" The judge barred Hasan from pleading guilty at the start of the court-martial. Under military law, defendants cannot enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases. Osborn has refused to allow Hasan to argue ""defense of others,"" a claim that he carried out the shootings to protect the Afghan Taliban and its leaders from U.S. soldiers. Hasan challenges witness account of shooting . Perhaps as a way around that ruling, Hasan in recent days has leaked documents through his civilian attorney to The New York Times and Fox News that offer a glimpse of his justification for carrying out the attack. Among the documents was a mental health evaluation conducted by a military panel to determine whether Hasan was fit to stand trial. ""I don't think what I did was wrong because it was for the greater cause of helping my Muslim brothers,"" he told the panel, according to pages of the report published by The New York Times. He also said, according to the documents: ""I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life. However, if I died by lethal injection, I would still be a martyr."" Military prosecutors called 89 witnesses and submitted more than 700 pieces of evidence before resting their case, hoping to show that the American-born Muslim had undergone what they described as a progressive radicalization. They have argued to the jury that Hasan, who was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan, did not want to fight other Muslims and believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible. The judge excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack, including e-mail communications between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric who officials say became a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011. She also declined to allow prosecutors to use materials they maintain showed Hasan's interest in the actions of Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar, the American soldier sentenced to death for killing two soldiers and wounding more than a dozen others at the start of the Iraq war, an attack he said he carried out to stop soldiers from killing Muslims. Along with the e-mails and the material related to Akbar, Osborn also declined to allow the use of Hasan's academic presentation on suicide bombings, saying ""motive is not an element of the crime."" The final witness called by the prosecution, Dr. Tonya Kozminski, testified Tuesday about what Hasan told her would happen to the Army if he were deployed. ""The last thing he said ... 'They will pay,' "" Kozminski said. Hasan's defense strategy martyrdom? CNN's Ed Lavandera and Jason Morris contributed to this report.","Deliberations are suspended for the night .

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose new book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says television's first anchorman took his replacement by Walter Cronkite with grace. (CNN) -- If you are a person whose life has been a series of constant triumphs, accompanied by the sound of unending cheers -- a life like that of, say, Walter Cronkite -- then this story is not for you. But if your life has had its share of disappointments and setbacks, you may be interested in the tale of a man by the name of Douglas Edwards. For some of you, the name may be vaguely familiar. For most of you, it probably means nothing. Douglas Edwards was the anchorman of CBS' evening news broadcasts for 14 years. He was, in fact, network television's first anchorman; his broadcast -- ""Douglas Edwards with the News,"" it was called -- first aired at the dinner hour on CBS in 1948, and continued until 1962, when Edwards was told he was being replaced by Cronkite. For those 14 years, during the so-called Golden Age of Television, Edwards' face was the face of CBS News. And CBS was the most prestigious of the three national networks. So what happened to him? Chet Huntley and David Brinkley happened to him. NBC's ""Huntley-Brinkley Report"" became wildly popular with the public; it was clobbering Edwards in the ratings. CBS decided that it had to make a move. Such decisions are common in television, and in the wider world of business. What is uncommon -- what is a valuable lesson in grace and dignity -- is how Doug Edwards dealt with his demotion. I sought him out in the early 1980s. More than 18 years had passed since he had been pushed aside. He was still an employee of CBS. His job was to deliver a one-minute television ""newsbreak"" each mid-morning. He also was assigned to three brief radio reports a day. He was as polite a man as I have ever met; we ended up keeping in touch over the years (he died at age 73 in 1990). Whatever bitterness he may have felt about losing the job he cherished, whatever anger he may have harbored toward the people who took it away from him, he chose to keep to himself. He had the same middle-of-the-country upbringing that Cronkite did; Edwards was born in Ada, Oklahoma, and moved as a teenager with his family to Alabama. His journalistic credentials were impeccable; he worked with Edward R. Murrow on CBS Radio's storied London staff toward the end of World War II, and his interview subjects included Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy. His on-scene reporting of the sinking of the Italian liner Andrea Doria in 1956 received widespread praise, and he was the recipient of a George Foster Peabody Award for his television work. He told me that after his demotion, he and Cronkite continued to run into each other in the hallways of CBS. Cronkite had become an American institution. Edwards told me there was no awkwardness, that the two of them liked and respected each other. Cronkite, in his autobiography, confirmed this. He wrote that on a Friday in 1962, a CBS executive told him that he would be taking over the anchor chair on Monday. Edwards' fall was just that abrupt. Cronkite wrote: . ""I was advised that Doug had just been told. I went straight to his office to try to assure him that I had not lobbied for his job and that the change had surprised me as much as I assumed it had surprised him. He must have been in shock, but he greeted me without the slightest touch of rancor. We had a short chat and parted with a sincere handshake. In this as in all things, Doug showed class. He was a true gentleman."" Cronkite's rise became the stuff of legend. And there was Doug Edwards, doing those daytime newsbreaks in the same building. He told me once that he had not given up on getting a bigger job again at the network: ""My attitude is, 'Let's play for time here.' I've seen things change."" But they didn't. When Ted Turner launched CNN, Edwards considered asking for work there. When ABC began its ""Nightline"" program, Edwards held out hope that CBS would try to match it late at night. ""I can do more nighttime television any time they'd like me to,"" he told me. ""I think I do a pretty fair job on the anchor desk. There just aren't that many jobs."" He paused, then said: ""Well, maybe I'm living in a fool's paradise. The tendency is to give something like that to younger men. But I'm ready. If the chance came, my wife and I could move back from Connecticut and take an apartment in the city."" It had to have hurt, watching Cronkite, and then Dan Rather, sit, year after year, in the chair that had been his; it had to have made him ache over what might have been. But on his retirement day in 1988, delivering his last daytime newsbreak, Edwards read a few headlines, then paused for the airing of a Doan's Pills commercial. When the live camera came back to him, he could have said anything. This is what Douglas Edwards said: . ""A deep bow of gratitude, love and respect to the men and women of CBS News and to the company for which they stand. To you out there, thank you for honoring me with your presence in our audience, and most of all for your voices -- your most sweet voices."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Douglas Edwards was network television's first anchorman .

"(CNN) -- At least 73 people are dead and more than 21,000 people homeless after Tropical Storm Irina struck Madagascar, an official with the nation's disaster bureau said Wednesday. One person has been injured, and two more are missing, according to Setra Rakotomandrindra of the National Bureau of Natural Catastrophes. About 21,235 people are homeless, he said, and a total of 67,911 people have been affected, mostly in the southeastern part of the island nation. The government was using tents to house those who need shelter, he said. Irina was Madagascar's second violent storm in two weeks, according to the IRIN news agency, a service of the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Cyclone Giovanna wreaked havoc on Madagascar last month, IRIN said. But ""while most people had been warned of Giovanna's destructive potential, Irina took the Indian Ocean island largely by surprise, destroying roads and houses already weakened by the first cyclone."" More than 100 people have died during the nation's current cyclone season, which usually runs from January to March, IRIN said. Most of the casualties were in the southeastern town of Ifanadiana, where a mudslide swallowed homes and caused a traffic accident involving a minibus, according to IRIN. Main roads in Madagascar have been reopened as of Wednesday, Rakotomandrindra said. CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.","NEW: 2 people are missing, official says .

"(CNN) -- Forget about the Moonmen. It was all about the performances at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. The VMAs were held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn; it was the first time the show has been held in New York in four years. From Lady Gaga's return to the VMAs stage in search of ""Applause"" to the not-so-secret 'N SYNC reunion, we count down the most memorable VMA moments. Photos: 2013 VMAs: Stars rock the red carpet . 1. Lady Gaga gets a round of ""Applause"" The provocateur was surprisingly tame for her return to the VMAs stage and first performance of her new single, ""Applause."" Lady Gaga opened the VMAs with a tight shot of her wide-eyed face surrounded by a sea of white. When the camera zoomed out, it was revealed that Gaga was wearing a white cardboard square on her head and a long white robe. It was no meat dress, but the singer went through a number of costume changes during her act, eventually ending up in a seashell bra and thong. 2. Miley Cyrus twerks the stage . Miley Cyrus' performance of ""We Can't Stop"" surely turned heads with her skimpy outfit, twerking and several crotch grabs. Miley wore a furry leotard and danced around the stage with oversize teddy bears. But it was her collaboration with Robin Thicke for his hit single, ""Blurred Lines"" that caused a gasp among the crowd. Miley stripped down to a nude bra and underwear and, with a foam finger in hand, she proceeded to grind her body hard against Thicke, making his controversial music video seem PG-rated. 3. Taylor Swift's boy ""Trouble"" It was four years ago on the VMAs stage that Taylor Swift was interrupted by Kanye West during her big moment. After vowing to keep a stronger grip on the mic this time, Swift proudly claimed her award for Best Female Video for ""I Knew You Were Trouble."" But it wouldn't really be the VMAs without an awkward Taylor run-in. During her speech, she said, ""I want to thank the person that inspired this song -- and he knows exactly who he is -- because I got one of these!"" Cut to Swift's ex Harry Styles of One Direction in the audience. But it was an earlier moment caught on camera that got the Twitterverse buzzing. When One Direction presented Selena Gomez with ""Best Pop Video"" for ""Come and Get It,"" cameras caught a glimpse of Swift allegedly mouthing the words, ""Shut the f--- up"" . It may not have been as scandalous as Kanye's ""I'mma let you finish but ..."" moment but it was enough to get the Taylor GIFs started. 2013 VMAs: Complete winners list . 4. Katy Perry's TKO . In another debut performance - and perhaps another competition with Gaga - Katy Perry closed out the 2013 MTV VMA's with her new hit single, ""Roar."" Perry gave a ferocious performance under the Brooklyn Bridge in a set designed to look like a boxing ring, while she rocked a tiger print sports bra and satin shorts. 5. Macklemore's 'Love' for everyone . It was fitting that basketball player Jason Collins, who came out earlier this year, helped introduce Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. The hip-hop duo took home three Moonmen, including one for ""Best Video with a Social Message"" for ""Same Love."" The duo also performed the marriage equality anthem for supportive fans who were treated to guest vocalists Mary Lambert and Jennifer Hudson . Photos: Coming out in Hollywood . 6: Justin Timberlake: President of Pop . Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Kanye West and Drake were all great, but the artist fans were really waiting for was Justin TImberlake - and they were treated to the full ""20/20 Experience."" Ten years after JT made his solo debut at the VMAs, he was honored with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, presented by ""Late Night"" host Jimmy Fallon. The multi-hyphenate earned a standing ovation as he sang and danced his way through his hits starting with the new ""Take Back the Night"" and working backward to the worst-kept secret in Hollywood: Timberlake and his former boy band brethren 'N SYNC reunited on stage. Lance Bass, J.C. Chasez, Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick came together for a brief walk down memory lane to sing ""Girlfriend"" and ""Bye Bye Bye."" Timberlake might have tied with Macklemore and Lewis for most Video Music Awards with three Moonmen each, but only one of them had a 20 minute chunk of the show devoted to him. As JT said in his modified version of ""SexyBack,"" ""I still run this b---h.""","MTV's Video Music Awards were held in New York for the first time in four years .

"(EW.com) -- ABC entertainment president Paul Lee says he's going to take a look at the long-gestating Star Wars live-action TV series now that the Disney deal to acquire Lucasfilm is complete. ""We'd love to do something with Lucasfilm, we're not sure what yet,"" Lee exclusively told EW. ""We haven't even sat down with them. We're going to look at [the live-action series], we're going to look at all of them, and see what's right. We weren't able to discuss this with them until [the acquisition] closed and it just closed. It's definitely going to be part of the conversation."" Even many working in Hollywood don't realize a live-action Star Wars TV series has been sitting on the shelf the past few years. The project was commissioned by longtime Lucasfilm producer Rick McCallum, who enlisted writers such as ""Battlestar Galactica's"" Ron Moore and swore them to NDA secrecy on the plot details (more on the show's storyline below). Fifty scripts were written. McCallum once called the scripts the most ""provocative, bold and daring material that we've ever done."" And then ... nothing. The scripts gathered dust, the scope of the production and the extent of the show's necessary visual effects deemed too expensive for a broadcast or cable network. The president of one premium cable outlet told me last summer the project just didn't make any financial sense. The closest comparison was HBO's lavish ""Game of Thrones."" But that deal gave HBO control of a major chunk of the ""Thrones"" empire, including DVD and international distribution which significantly offset the show's high production cost. The Star Wars show was budgeted at more than $5 million per episode and Lucasfilm wanted to retain ownership. 'Breaking Dawn -- Part 1': Unseen scene! But now Disney has purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion and Disney owns more than a couple TV networks. The financials for a big-budget TV show are more compelling if the license fee and other income sources stay in the family. Already one Star Wars-related project is in the works for kids network Disney XD. Cartoon Network's popular and innovative animated title The Clone Wars will likely shift to XD after its current deal expires. Could the live-action show finally see the light of day too? It's a tricky question because a new Star Wars film is planned for 2015. Cautious brand managers are sometimes reluctant to have a live-action TV show on the air when producing live-action films â€” such as Warner Bros. putting the kibosh on any Batman TV projects while making Christopher Nolan's trilogy. Lee said he wasn't sure if the project was still viable. ""It's going to be very much up to the Lucasfilm brands how they want to play it,"" he said. ""We got to a point here with Marvel, a very special point, where we're in the Marvel universe, and very relevantly so, but we're not doing ""The Avengers."" But ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" is part of The Avengers. So maybe something oblique is the way to [approach the Star Wars universe] rather than going straight head-on at it."" Sources say the live-action series centers on the story of rival families struggling over the control of the seedy underside of the Star Wars universe and the people who live within the subterranean level and air shafts of the metropolis planet Coruscant (the Empire's urban-sprawl-covered home planet). A bounty hunter may be the main character. Set between the original Star Wars film trilogy and the prequels, the time period allows for all sorts of potential appearances from classic figures from the Star Wars universe. '30 Rock': 12 best 'Game Over' lines . Extensive art work including character designs, costume designs, and set designs were all developed by a top team of concept artists and designers who worked for more than a year on the third floor design studio at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch's main house on the project. The team was closely supervised by McCallum and Lucas. If all this sounds vaguely familiar, it might be because this roughly matches the description of the upcoming Star Wars videogame ""1313."" In fact, sources say story materials and the designs for the TV project were used to help make the game. So if you want to see what the TV show was supposed to look like, check out art from ""1313"" (one example above). This creative strip-mining could arguably help the TV show's chances â€” it's not like Hollywood has been shy about doing crossovers between videogames and films before.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran has sentenced a former U.S. Marine to death, accusing him of espionage. A court convicted Amir Mirzaei Hekmati of ""working for an enemy country,"" as well as membership in the CIA and ""efforts to accuse Iran of involvement in terrorism,"" the semi-official Fars news agency reported Monday. Hekmati's family and the U.S. government deny the allegations. The sentence came down five months after Hekmati's arrest. The news came amid rising tensions between the United States and Iran. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed Monday that uranium enrichment has begun at a nuclear facility in northern Iran. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was on a visit to Venezuela, where President Hugo Chavez said the two of them were working together to stop the ""imperial insanity"" of the United States. Iran's state-run news agency IRNA, on its English website, said the court found Hekmati ""caught red-handed in armed struggle against God"" and ""corrupt on Earth."" ""In the proceedings Hekmati said he had the motivation to infiltrate (the) Iranian intelligence system on behalf of the CIA,"" the IRNA report said. Hekmati's parents said they were ""shocked and terrified"" by the news. ""We believe that this verdict is the result of a process that was neither transparent nor fair,"" Behnaz Hekmati wrote in a statement on behalf of herself and her husband, Ali. ""Amir did not engage in any acts of spying, or 'fighting against God,' as the convicting judge has claimed in his sentence. Amir is not a criminal. His very life is being exploited for political gain,"" the statement said. ""A grave error has been committed, and we have authorized our legal representatives to make direct contact with the Iranian authorities to find a solution to this misunderstanding. We pray that Iran will show compassion and not murder our son, Amir, a natural born American citizen, who was visiting Iran and his relatives for the first time."" The statement also said Iran was denying that Amir is a U.S. citizen. The U.S. State Department said it was working to confirm the reports about the sentence. Colleague, family: Iranian-American no spy . ""If true, we strongly condemn this verdict,"" said department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. ""Allegations that Mr. Hekmati either worked for or was sent to Iran by the CIA are simply untrue. The Iranian regime has a history of falsely accusing people of being spies, of eliciting forced confessions, and of holding innocent Americans for political reasons."" The department urged Iran ""to grant the Swiss protecting power immediate access to Mr. Hekmati, grant him access to legal counsel, and release him without delay. "" In the absence of diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran, Switzerland serves as the ""protecting power"" for U.S. interests in the country. Previously, Hekmati's family members said he was being represented by a government-appointed lawyer, despite their repeated efforts to hire a private lawyer for him. Hekmati was arrested in August while visiting his grandmother and other relatives, his family in Michigan said last month. The Hekmatis said their son served in the Marines from 2001 to 2005. Later, he started his own linguistics company and contracted his services to the military as well as civilian businesses. Ahmadinejad visits Venezuela . His military contracts included cultural competency training. He worked with troops at military bases to promote understanding and positive communication with people of other cultures, his family said. Fars reported that Hekmati said he worked for the U.S. Army for four years and later the CIA, where he was sent to Afghanistan and had access to secret documents. Fars also reported that Hekmati told a judge he worked for the CIA and that he was to be paid for delivering information to Iran's Intelligence Ministry. He was supposed to give his information to the Iranians in two parts -- the first part for free, and if they liked it, he would ask for $500,000 for the second part, the news agency said. Hekmati said he was to get a receipt from the ministry for the money, Fars reported. The judge speculated whether the receipt would later be used as evidence linking Iran to terrorist activities, the news agency said. If Iran had paid, Hekmati told the judge, he would have kept the money and lived in Iran, according to Fars. Iran's notorious secretive trials have been assailed by human rights groups and governments around the globe. The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report on Iran says the court system is, in practice, ""corrupt and subject to political influence."" And while the country's constitution provides a defendant the right to a public trial, presumption of innocence, and a lawyer of his or her choice, ""These rights were not respected in practice."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday the United States takes the situation surrounding Hekmati ""very seriously and we are addressing it in the appropriate manner."" Asked specifically about what actions the U.S. government might take on Hekmati's behalf, he referred to the State Department statement. Carney noted that the United States and other Western nations have sanctioned Tehran over its failure to cooperate on nuclear issues. ""We are putting a great deal of pressure on Iran broadly because of its rogue behavior,"" Carney said, adding that Iran ""won't live up to its international obligations with regards to its nuclear program."" Hekmati is the latest in a series of Americans to face arrest in the country in recent years. Three U.S. hikers, also accused of spying, were arrested in 2009 and ultimately released. Sarah Shourd was freed on medical grounds in 2010; Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer were freed in September 2011. Journalist Roxana Saberi was arrested in January 2009 and convicted of espionage in a one-day trial that was closed to the public. She was freed in May that year. Reza Taghavi, an Iranian-American retired businessman, was freed by Iran in 2010 after being held more than two years on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group, his lawyer said. Iranian-American Kian Tajbakhsh was among many people arrested in July 2009, amid post-election protests and a massive government crackdown. Exactly what he was convicted of was not clear. In March the next year, he was allowed temporary release within the country to celebrate the Persian New Year. That temporary release was later extended, according to the website freekian09.org, which works for his release.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- More than a decade after a terrorist attack brought down New York's twin towers, their replacement -- an emerging new addition to the Manhattan skyline -- has nearly reached a landmark height. The One World Trade Center is now 100 stories high, stretching just over 1,244 feet and just 6 feet shy of the Empire State Building (without its antenna), according to Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The colossal steel structure is in the coming weeks expected to surpass the frame of the Empire State Building, which is currently Gotham's tallest skyscraper. The building reached its 100th floor last week and is expected to be completed by next year or sometime in early 2014, Coleman said Tuesday. Built on what was once referred to as ground zero in Lower Manhattan, the building will reach 1776 feet by way of a mast fixed atop its peak, making it the nation's tallest structure. The Willis Tower in Chicago, formerly known as the Sears Tower, which stands at 1,450 feet and 110 stories high, is the country's current record holder. Housing three top floor observation decks, the first 90 floors of the One World Trade Center building will be designated for office space. The following 10 floors are to be reserved for air conditioning, heating, and electrical equipment. Despite years of political infighting and real estate squabbling that delayed its construction, more than half of the building has now been rented, with a tenant list that includes Conde Nast publishing company and a Chinese real estate investment firm called Vantone Holdings. In its shadow, twin reflecting pools are situated in the footprints of where the Twin Towers once stood. The names of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks, as well as six people who died in the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, are emblazoned across bronze panels ringing the pools.","The One World Trade Center building is now 100 stories tall, reaching just over 1,244 feet .

"(CNN) -- While half of civilization busied itself trying to find out the name, weight, gender, hair color, taste in music and political disposition of the new heir to the British throne, it turns out there was a whole world of other news happening out there. Here are five other stories you may have missed today: . 1. Dubai pardons woman jailed after reporting rape . A 24-year-old Norwegian woman says she was raped by a colleague in a Dubai hotel following a work party -- but after she went to police, she was convicted and sentenced to 16 months in jail on charges of having unlawful sex, making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol. Now Dubai's ruler has pardoned Marte Deborah Dalelv according to Norway's foreign minister, who called Dalelv's conviction ""contrary to fundamental human rights."" Dalelv will be free to travel where she wants and can remain in Dubai if she chooses. 2. Dozens dead as earthquake hits northwest China . A shallow, powerful 5.9-magnitude earthquake tore through China's Gansu Province, killing at least 89 people and injuring hundreds more, according to state media. The original quake and powerful aftershocks caused roofs to collapse, cut telecommunications lines and damaged a major highway. Emergency services have converged on the area to try to rescue survivors. 3. Hezbollah's military wing is a terrorist group, says EU . The European Union has joined the U.S. and Israel in designating the military wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, but stopped short of putting the entire group on its terror list. The Bulgarians cited evidence that the military wing of the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group was involved in a terror attack last year that killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian bus driver. In Cyprus earlier this year, a court found a Hezbollah member guilty of assisting in the planning of an attack on Israel. Lately, its fighters have sided with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's civil war. The designation, which a spokeswoman for Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni called ""correct and just,"" would freeze the assets of Hezbollah entities. 4. Man who bombed Beijing airport wanted to flag 'unjust treatment' The wheelchair-bound Ji Zhongxing, 34, set off a homemade explosive inside a Beijing airport on Saturday after he was stopped from handing out leaflets ""to get attention to his complaints"" outside the arrival hall, according to Xinhua news agency. Ji said on his personal blog in 2006 that he had been beaten by security guards outside a police station in 2005 after carrying a passenger on his motorcycle -- a charge the police denied. He was paralyzed after the incident and petitioned for official compensation. Ji was hospitalized after he detonated his explosives. No other people were injured and flights at the airport were not affected. 5. CNN Exclusive: Glee star Charice on why she'll miss Cory Monteith . In an exclusive opinion piece for CNN.com, ""Glee"" star Charice writes that her body went cold when she learned co-star Cory Monteith had been found dead from a drug overdose in his hotel room in Vancouver. Charice says Monteith, who had been frank about his struggles with substance abuse in the past, was a ""real talent"" -- and that she has no idea what will happen to the hit American musical now that the actor is gone.","Dubai pardons Norwegian woman who was jailed after reporting being raped .

"(CNN) -- Blistering hot temperatures will blast the normally tepid Pacific Northwest again Thursday as dozens of wildfires burn across large sections of the western United States. The mercury is expected to soar near triple digits in Portland, Oregon, with Seattle forecast to reach the lower 90s, the National Weather Service said. The coastal region is roasting under an excessive heat warning. At least 70 large fires were burning across 13 states west of the Mississippi River, according to the National Interagency Coordination Center. California had the most with 13, followed by Nevada with 12 and Idaho with 10, the center said. The Marines joined the fight on Wednesday, with helicopter units from California joining U.S. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units from Colorado, Wyoming, North Carolina and California in fighting the fires by air. The Marine units will help fight fires around San Diego. In California alone, 8,000 firefighters were fighting a dozen fires, the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Wednesday. The state issued a burn ban, saying only some campfires are allowed. Conditions could worsen in some places over the next few days. The National Weather Service said a weather pattern developing in parts of Oregon could produce conditions favorable to ""explosive fire growth."" In central Washington state, the wind-whipped Taylor Bridge Fire had scorched some 22,600 acres and destroyed at least 60 homes, fire officials said. One of those structures was the home of Elaine Burt, who unsuccessfully tried to get past firefighters to save her dogs and other animals at her home, according to CNN affiliate KING-TV.. After the initial heartbreak of being told all of them were gone, she learned Wednesday that Hannah, one of her dogs, and six of her pigs had survived. ""Oh Mama ... hi mama,"" Burt said when she saw her sow at the Kittitas County Fairgrounds. ""One, two, three, four, five, yup, that's all her little babies."" Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire declared Kittitas and Yakima counties to be in states of emergency, according to a written statement from her office. The Washington National Guard will provide air support to the Department of Natural Resources, which is in charge of statewide firefighting efforts. Authorities have already evacuated around 900 people near the Taylor Bridge Fire, the governor's office said. No injuries were reported. More than 900 firefighters were battling the fire near Cle Elum, Washington, said Rex Reed, the incident commander. The Incident Alert System showed the blaze was 25% contained early Thursday . The weather was ""cooperating"" Wednesday, he said, referring to calmer winds, but firefighters have their work cut out for them the rest of the week. Hot and dry conditions are expected. ""Unless Mother Nature helps us out here, we're going to be fighting this a while,"" Joe Seemiller, a captain with Kittitas County Fire and Rescue, told CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. Elsewhere, more evacuations were under consideration near Featherville, Idaho, where more than 800 firefighters were trying to get a hand on the sprawling Trinity Ridge fire. The fire grew significantly since Tuesday, burning more than 68,000 acres and forcing authorities to call an emergency meeting of residents of Featherville and nearby Pine to discuss possible evacuations. Near the border between Oregon and California, crews were battling an aggressive southern run by the Barry Point Fire, which has torched some 59,000 acres of land in the two states, according to the incident command team's website. With temperatures above 90 degrees, low humidity and wind gusts nearing 20 mph, the lightning-sparked fire has a high potential for further growth, the interagency center said, forcing the evacuation of homes in California, 15 miles south of the state border. Residents evacuate as hundreds of firefighters battle California wildfires . More than 800 firefighters and support personnel were working in Oregon and Nevada to corral the 436,600-acre Holloway Fire, the largest of the Western wildfires. It was ignited by a lightning strike on August 5. Incident commanders said Wednesday that they hope to have the Nevada portion of the fire out on Wednesday. In Northern California, the Rush Fire had torched 101,000 acres since Sunday, the National Interagency Coordination Center reported. Meteorologists predict the dry heat will last into next week, not good news for firefighters. Any thunderstorms that pop up could present more bad news than good, since lightning strikes could spark more flames. As of Wednesday, wildfires have burned through 6.47 million acres this year, surpassing the 6.36 million acres burned by this date last year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The total acreage burned this year is about 3.4 million acres short of the record set in 2006, when 1,801 fires burned a total of 9.87 million acres, according to center statistics.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- We already knew that opponents of immigration reform had no good arguments in favor of preserving the status quo. Now we know they have no shame. Some of them are deliberately mixing apples and oranges and trying to use the tragedy of the Boston Marathon bombing to scuttle efforts in Washington to achieve immigration reform. All last week, my friends in the immigration reform community held their collective breath and hoped that -- when investigators finally zeroed in on a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing -- that person would NOT turn out to be foreign-born. Immigrants are blamed for enough in society; they need not be blamed for this tragedy. Besides, from the perspective of the reformers, the timing couldn't be worse. A few days after the bombing, the Senate's ""gang of eight"" unveiled what is the most significant piece of immigration reform legislation in more than a quarter century. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 is an expertly crafted, bipartisan compromise that has a real shot at improving the lives of millions of people and fixing a broken system. Yet, because of unrelated events, the legislation could wind up hanging by a thread. Why? Because the prime suspects in the Boston bombing are immigrants: 19-year-old Dzhokhar ""Jahar"" Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The brothers are from the Russian Caucasus region and moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States. Tamerlan was killed Thursday night in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar escaped and was at large Friday until he was found in Watertown, Massachusetts, and apprehended by police. According to what two sources told CNN, Tamerlan had been living in the United States legally on a green card. Dzhokhar first came to the United States as a tourist in the early 2000's and later asked for asylum. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen just last year, on September 11, 2012. There's that infamous date again. It's worth noting that Americans started the long and difficult journey toward immigration reform on September 5, 2001, when President George W. Bush welcomed Mexican President Vicente Fox to the White House for a state dinner in his honor. Earlier in the day, both leaders told reporters that they wanted to fix the immigration system and match willing employers in the United States with willing workers in Mexico. The reform was supposed to include a pathway to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants in the United States. Six days later, our country was attacked and the world changed. Immediately, immigration reform was put so far onto the back burner that it eventually fell clear off the stove. Most supporters of immigration reform, including many Latinos, believe that this was immensely unfair. The 19 hijackers were from the Middle East, and they came to the United States legally, many on student visas. So why would their evil acts have the effect of torpedoing the prospect of immigration reform that primarily affects millions of illegal immigrants from Latin America? Now, here we are again. Earlier this week, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa -- a vocal foe of immigration reform who has suggested the answer to securing the border is electrified fencing because, as he once said on the House floor, ""we do this with livestock all the time"" -- suggested that the congressional debate on the immigration bill should go slow because the suspects in the Boston bombing might turn out to be foreign nationals. That is just what happened. Was that a lucky guess? Or is that how this guy's mind works -- that every time something bad happens, an immigrant must be to blame? On Friday, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa jumped into the fray during a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""Given the events of this week, it's important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,"" he said. ""How can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the United States? How do we ensure that people who wish to do us harm are not eligible for benefits under the immigration laws, including this new bill?"" Also piling on was conservative columnist Ann Coulter, who has made clear over the last few months that she opposes immigration reform because she thinks it would lead to the ""end of America"" since Latinos are busy ""having illegitimate children and going on welfare."" She marked the shootout in Boston, and took a poke at the Florida senator who is leading immigration reform efforts, by mischievously tweeting: . ""It's too bad Suspect No. 1 won't be able to be legalized by Marco Rubio, now."" Again, the Tsarnaev brothers were immigrants, but they didn't need to be ""legalized."" They were already in the country legally. But, hey, why let facts in the way of a good screed? In response, a spokesman for Rubio said in an e-mail to the Christian Science Monitor: ""There are legitimate policy questions to ask and answer about what role our immigration system played, if any, in what happened. Regardless of the circumstances in Boston, immigration reform that strengthens our borders and gives us a better accounting of who is in our country and why will improve our national security. Americans will reject any attempt to tie the terrorists responsible for the attacks in Boston with the millions of decent, law-abiding immigrants currently living in the U.S. and those hoping to immigrate here in the future."" Let's hope that's right, and that most Americans do see these tactics for what they are: desperate attempts to thwart reform. Here is the predicament that the nativists and right-wing demagogues find themselves in, whether they realize it or not. They want to opportunistically use the fact that bombing suspects were foreign nationals to once again derail immigration reform. But, in doing so, they walk away from the table and wind up defending the current immigration system. The Rubio spokesman had it right. We have to know who is in this country, and what their intentions are -- whether they came legally or illegally. This is one of the things that immigration reform is about. No reform plan is perfect, but the status quo is flatly not acceptable. We have to keep the debate going. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Immigration reform critics are wrongly citing the Boston bombing .

"(CNN) -- First came the stuff that floats on the surface and is pushed by wind: Buoys, a soccer ball, flotation devices. And, most notably, a rust-stained unmanned fishing trawler in Alaskan waters. Communities in Alaska, Hawaii, the West Coast and Canada are preparing for the main event from debris pushed offshore by last year's massive Japanese earthquake and tsunami. About 70% of the debris sank, according to Japanese government estimates. No one knows how much of the remaining 1.5 million tons of debris is still floating in the Pacific Ocean. But U.S. and state officials say that some items washing ashore may be from the disaster, which took place 13 months ago and nearly 5,000 miles away. Thousands of people were killed. ""Our models show the outer edge of the debris is at the West Coast and Alaska now,"" Nancy Wallace, program director and division chief of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Debris Program, said Wednesday. The bulk of the debris is north of Hawaii, slowly moving east. In Washington state, there have been reports of lumber, lightbulbs and fishing items reaching land. Their source has not been confirmed. Officials can't rule out they came from the tsunami, according to Curt Hart, communications manager at the the state's Department of Ecology. A volunteer helping in a beach cleanup this weekend along the Washington coast said she found items that appeared to include Japanese writing, according to CNN Seattle affiliate KING. That doesn't prove they were part of the tsunami debris, officials caution. NOAA said there is no current ""debris field."" Rather, items, large and small, are scattered over a huge swath of the North Pacific and may make landfall intermittently. Residents are being told to expect reports of debris to increase and continue over the next couple of years. What might they see? For starters, building materials, fishing nets and gear, plastic, barrels and hazardous materials. Federal, state and local officials held a workshop in Ocean Shores, Washington, on Wednesday, to discuss strategies for handling additional debris. The workshop followed a round of meetings in Washington communities. ""I think my folks have heard a little bit of everything at these meetings,"" said Tim Church, communications director for the Washington State Department of Health. ""The great majority who have come have been low-key about it."" Some people have asked whether any bodies will come ashore. That's not expected. The top concern is whether radioactive material from the Fukushima nuclear power plant will make landfall. NOAA has said that scenario is highly unlikely. ""We do not expect to see anything to wash up from Japan with elevated levels of radiation,"" said Church. ""At the same time, we fully appreciate the concern of people. If you spend a lot of time on the coast, if you see the news coverage, you want to see you are safe."" A beach cleanup this past weekend along the Washington shore included checks with radiation-detecting equipment, according to Church. ""There just had not been anything so far."" No single government agency is in charge of patrolling and cleaning beaches; hence the planning and public information campaign. ""We are poised ... with a well-coordinated response,"" said Hart of the state ecology department. ""We are going to see items from the tsunami on our beaches."" Of concern for his agency is the potential for oil or chemical drums or fuel cylinders to come ashore. That risk could increase as the region sees normal stormy weather kick up later this year, according to Hart. The U.S. Coast Guard is focusing on pollution threats and any impediments to navigation, according to Lt. Regina Caffrey, a public affairs officer in Washington state. Lynne Talley, a physical oceanographer with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, said the debris was initially carried on the swift Kuroshio current, but slowed as it joined another current west of Hawaii. ""It is now scattered over 4,000 miles in one direction and 1,000 miles in another area,"" Talley said. ""The front edge of it has gotten here and the whole cloud should arrive at the end of another year."" To better pinpoint the debris and update models, NOAA has turned to satellite images and reports from commercial shipping lines, according to Wallace of the marine debris program. ""It is extremely spread out, and if you were sailing through it you would not see much,"" said Talley. Earlier this month, the U.S. Coast Guard opened fire on the drifting 200-foot trawler 180 miles southwest of Sitka, Alaska, after it determined the ""unmanned, unlit, unmarked vessel"" posed a hazard to mariners and the marine environment. It was a dramatic end for the Japanese squid trawler. It was bound for a scrap yard before becoming part of the debris. The soccer ball that recently washed up on a remote Alaskan beach apparently belonged to a teenager from a Japanese city devastated by the earthquake and tsunami. Misaki Murakami, a 16-year-old high school student, said he has ""no doubt"" that the ball is his after hearing that his name was among the characters written on it, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. NOAA blogs about the soccer ball . Ocean debris is nothing new, but ""If you look at it over a long time, it is worse now than it has been,"" said Wallace. Plastic does not degrade, nor does fishing gear made of synthetic materials. ""Derelict fishing gear used to be made of ropes and would break down quicker,"" she said. Even with models and technology, predicting exactly where debris will come ashore is far from an exact science. ""We can only forecast a few days into the future, because of wind and current,"" Wallace said. ""We expect there to be an upswing in debris on the shore. The interesting thing is we don't know where it's going to be, and we think it is going to be spread out."" She cautioned against overreaction. ""We don't want people to cancel their beach vacation (thinking) it will be inundated with beach debris,"" said Wallace. Still, agencies want to be prepared, and officials understand concerns. ""This is a really human tragedy that happened in Japan,"" said Wallace. ""It captured the media and public's sympathy. Afterward, you saw the videos of what was washed"" out into the sea. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Last year's earthquake and tsunami sent tons of debris into Pacific Ocean .

"(CNN) -- Investigators have found evidence that Sandy Hook Elementary School gunman Adam Lanza ""was obsessed"" with other mass murderers, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Tuesday. This news follows an earlier report that Lanza may have been motivated by a desire to outdo Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian man who killed 77 people in July 2011, law enforcement sources told CBS Evening News. The unnamed CBS sources said Lanza saw himself as being in direct competition with Breivik, who killed eight with a bombing in downtown Oslo before he moved to a nearby island where he hunted down and fatally shot 69 people. According to the sources, the 20-year-old Lanza wanted to top Breivik's death toll and went to the Connecticut school on December 14 because it was the ""easiest target"" and had the ""largest cluster of people."" Video games to blame? The same officials also linked Lanza's actions to violent video games. The officials, who have been briefed on the Newtown, Connecticut, investigation, told CBS that evidence shows Lanza was likely acting out the fantasies of a video game in killing 20 children and six adults at the school. Lanza's mother, Nancy, also was found shot dead at her Newtown home. Police believe Lanza killed his mother before beginning his school rampage. He took his own life with a handgun as authorities closed in. Police dismiss report . A spokesman for the Connecticut State Police dismissed the CBS report, calling it speculation. ""It's inaccurate ... I talked with CBS and told them that,"" Lt. Paul Vance told CNN. ""We are dealing with a deceased shooter and trying to rebuild history."" Vance, however, did not dismiss the notion that investigators may have looked at the Norway shooting. ""We'll look at everything,"" Vance said. ""One thing leads to another."" Authorities have been largely tight-lipped about their investigation. Hundreds of state troopers, detectives and other law enforcement personnel are analyzing every round of ammunition fired, examining the gunman's medical history and computer use and talking to witnesses, Vance said previously. A final report on the Newtown shooting is expected this summer. Vance released a statement Tuesday afternoon that didn't refer to any specific news reports but denied that any information came from the state police. ""The unfortunate origin of unsubstantiated details of this case are both hurtful and, many times, inaccurate,"" Vance said in the statement. According to the news release, no information will be released until the investigation is finished, but detectives have no date when they will wrap up their interviews and evidence gathering. The Norway attacks . July 22, 2011, will live long in the memory of all Norwegians after the carnage that unfolded that day. After detonating a bomb outside the prime minister's office in Oslo, killing eight people, Breivik took a ferry to Utoya Island and embarked on a shooting spree that took the lives of another 69 people attending a youth camp. Authorities said Breivik roamed the lake island shooting at campers, before members of an elite Norwegian police unit took him into custody. In August 2012 Breivik, who boasted of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway, was judged to be sane at the time of the attack. He was convicted of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror and sentenced to 21 years in prison.

"(CNN) -- The Pennsylvania attorney general may be taking a second look at the actions of a rural high school where Jerry Sandusky was a volunteer coach in 2008 and where administrators have been publicly criticized for discouraging a student from making allegations of sexual abuse against the then-famous coach. That student, Aaron Fisher, later became known as the first of 10 victims in a scathing indictment of serial and predatory child sex abuse by Sandusky, who is now serving 30 years in prison for his crimes. The co-author of Fisher's book, Mike Gillum, told CNN that he and Fisher's mother have been approached by investigators with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office about the actions of administrators at Central Mountain High School in 2008. Matt Sandusky files motion to have name changed . Sandusky was a volunteer football coach and would often take Fisher from class without his mother's permission. Fisher, who was abused for four years, launched the investigation into Sandusky when he came forward to police in 2009. Fisher's mother has repeatedly said that the high school principal told her to wait and think about the implications of accusing Sandusky before calling authorities. Although there's been talk about an investigation by the state department of Education or by federal authorities, Gillum said this inquiry by the attorney general is the first time Fisher, his mom or Gillum have been contacted by investigators about the actions of school administrators. Sandusky's son, six others reach settlement with Penn State . In the past year, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane has launched a case-wide review of the Sandusky investigation because of numerous criticisms about the two-year gap between Fisher's report and Sandusky's arrest, plus allegations that charges weren't filed against others who might have known about Sandusky's abuse for months. Two former administrators and the former president of Penn State are facing trial on charges related to an alleged cover-up at the university. But Fisher's high school, Central Mountain, in the small town of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, has escaped scrutiny from authorities until now.

"(CNN) -- Rescue crews continued their frantic search Sunday at a Himalayan military outpost near the Indian border where a massive avalanche buried up to 139 people, most of them Pakistani soldiers. A blanket of rock and snow covering one square kilometer -- about the size of a large city block -- slid over the base on the Siachen glacier early Saturday morning, entombing it under 70 feet of snow. The Siachen Glacier, known as the world's highest battleground, is 6,300 meters (20,670 feet) high and spans 77 kilometers (47 miles) across the Line of Control that separates India- and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. A press release Sunday from the Pakistani military indicated that 139 people were believed trapped in the avalanche -- a figure that is slightly higher than previously reported. None of the searches thus far has led to the discovery of any survivors, and poor weather has hampered such efforts. ""It's a very massive scale slide,"" Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said Saturday. ""They are under the slide, but we haven't lost hope. The rescue work is on, and we are keeping our fingers crossed."" Crews flew in heavy machinery from neighboring Rawalpindi. Sniffer dogs and troops using bulldozers worked the ground. Abbas said the military had not been able to establish contact with anyone inside the base since the avalanche. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani visited Siachen on Sunday, noting Pakistan's military is mobilizing all possible resources for the search effort. He said the army ""has always risen to the occasion and will come through this challenge as well."" It was the first such disaster at the mountain headquarters in its two decades of existence, the military said. India, too, maintains a base on its side of the glacier in the disputed Kashmir region. Kashmir has been a source of bitter dispute between India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947. Under terms that the two countries agreed to at the time, Kashmir's rulers could either opt to merge with India or Pakistan or remain independent. One part sided with Pakistan. The ruler of the other part sided with India, where most people are Hindu. That caused controversy among the region's Muslim majority. Many of them wanted to align with Pakistan, where Islam is the dominant religion. Since then, the Kashmir issue has been the leading cause of conflict and two of three wars between the two countries. The Line of Control was formally established in 1972. But there have been routine accusations that both sides fire across the line -- accusations both have denied. In 1984, India occupied key portions of the glacier. Three years later, the two sides fought bitterly over Siachen. Both maintain year-round military camps on their sides of the disputed mountainous region. In February, two avalanches swept over military camps in the Indian-controlled side of Kashmir, killing at least 11 soldiers. The avalanches hit two army camps in the health resort of Sonamarg and at Dawar, a town close to the Line of Control. In January, another avalanche hit a joint patrol of the Indian army and border security forces in the Keran area, killing seven. Winter in Kashmir this season is harsher than previous years, with several snowfalls and sharp dips in temperatures.

"Editor's note: upwave is Turner Broadcasting's new lifestyle brand designed to entertain the health into you! Visit upwave.com for more information and follow upwave on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram @upwaveofficial. (upwave.com) -- Remember when Arnold Schwarzenegger used to promise us kids a special certificate from school if we did 100 push-ups in a row during gym? Well, it's not all jumping jacks and gray sweatpants these days -- but you still gotta move if you want to feel good. How much, you say? According to Let's Move, today's national fitness program, kids should get a total of 60 minutes of physical activity each day, and adults need 30. Here's why it matters, especially for the kids: Childhood obesity rates have tripled since the '80s, and at this rate, one third of all children born in 2000 or later will suffer from diabetes at some point in their lives. And let's not mention heart disease, asthma and tons of other largely preventable weight-related ailments. Besides, exercise just feels good -- and don't you think most family outings could use a bit more of that? So ditch the minivan and the trip to Chuck E. Cheese and head outside! Believe it or not, your kids will thank you: Endorphins plus fresh air and a fun family experience equals a refreshing way to get in better shape -- and you don't need to chase over-caffeinated children all over a noisy pizza arcade to do it. And with that said, here are six ways to move it, shake it and make exercise packed with family fun: . upwave: 7 reasons to sweat outdoors (you'll thank us) Walk the walk. If your crew usually heads to the couch after dinner, make them save their favorite show to the DVR and take a walk instead. Not long, not far, but make sure you get outside and let your meal digest while you stroll. If you're in a city, walk around the block; suburban dwellers can make tracks around the cul-de-sac. The point is simple: fresh air and a few steps together. What you need: Comfy shoes for sure. A stroller is optional. If it makes life fun, bring bikes, Razor scooters, roller skates and the dog, too -- anything that brings a smile to your party on the go. Make screen time smarter.  Stop begging the kids to put away the video games... and play with them instead! Fire up the Wii and compete with classics like ""Bowling,"" or bust a move with ""Just Dance."" Families with wee ones will love ""Mario Kart"" and ""Wii Fit."" Even ""Rock Band"" will get you up and out of your seat, which is the whole idea. More into watching plain ol' TV? Make it a goal (or competition) to jump up during commercials; whoever gets up first -- and stays on his or her feet for the duration of the commercial break -- wins. upwave: Stop sitting, it's really bad for you . Admittedly, a Nintendo Wii is an investment, but if you're game (see what we did there?), it's easy to find refurbished models for less than half the price of the latest and greatest. Take a hike. During the fall, there's nothing like an adventure in the great outdoors. National Geographic recently touted the Sourdough Ridge Trail at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State as one of the best family-friendly hikes in the U.S. They called it a ""mini-adventure through flower-filled meadows"" and ""a great way to introduce kids to the beauty of the high country."" Whether you're trekking in snow-capped mountains or at your local state park, it's hard to beat the call of the wild -- even if you're doing it with a Baby Bjorn. Speaking of which, if you're hiking with small children, you'll need an aluminum-framed baby backpack; look for one with a sun visor, water bottle pocket and a design that allows you to set the pack down with the child still sitting inside. Bring a bandana that you can soak in water for quick cool downs, plus some dried fruit to nosh on. (It's the single best snack to bring on hikes, because it won't melt or turn to dust if someone accidentally crushes the pack with his hiking boot.) upwave: How to hike with a baby . Strike a pose. If the wilds aren't for you, stay inside and stretch. Family yoga is huge now -- and that means your options are, too. Many studios offer family workouts, including partner poses and group discounts. You can get your Downward-Facing Dog on at home, too: There are kid-friendly cards with adorably illustrated yoga poses, illustrated books for kids and of course DVDs on yoga for families designed to guide your group through Tree Pose and Warrior Pose, too. All you'll need is loose, stretchable clothing and a mat (a folded beach towel will work). If you do yoga at home, don't get hung up on whether the kids are doing the moves right, or even doing all of them at all. Let them imitate you the way they want to. Chances are you'll be amazed at their flexibility. upwave: Does stretching really do anything? Run through the mud. Mud runs are everywhere -- you know, runs where you slip on a costume and slide through miles of muddy terrain? Many of them are also open to families. A single online search for ""family mud run"" resulted in pages of events happening all over the country this year. Moms and dads are Running the Ridge in Schenectady, New York, where ""features built by diabolical minds (are) ready to test you and your mud-running skills."" And families are getting dirty for charity in Pennsylvania: The Kids' Peace 5K Family Fun Mud Run takes place on a 250-acre campus that includes a sandpit crawl, cargo-net climb, Slip 'N Slide and of course a mud pit. If your family and your washing machine can take it, sign up for something near you now. Necessary: Running shoes. Costumes are optional. Just make sure both are things you don't mind getting dirty. Skip the sports drinks but do bring water bottles. Consider having a family T-shirt or team bottles made up. Bring a fresh set of clothes (including shoes) for everyone, along with a plastic bag to store the dirties in for the ride home. upwave: 5 mud runs not to miss . Hit the surf. Imagine yourself on a surfboard, ripping through the waves under a tropical sun. Now picture your kids splashing and smiling on their boards all the way to the shore. Truth? Surfing is wicked hard. But it's also a total adventure, and one that's now catering to families. And you don't have to head to Hawaii to do it (though you certainly could): Family surfing packages are popping up all over, from Costa Rica to the more local shores of California and North Carolina. Packages include room, board and some of the best instructors around (see ""wicked hard"" above). Word to the wise: Spring for a rash-guard shirt and the thickest SPF you can find. Then just hang loose like it's 1989, duuude.

"(CNN) -- HP and Google have rolled out an intriguing Chromebook today -- the 11-inch HP Chromebook 11. Chromebooks, as you may recall, run Google's web-centric Chrome Operating System consisting mainly of a web browser and promising simplicity and security. If you spend all your time in a web browser and don't want to spend much on a typical computer, a Chromebook would be worth a closer look. I've used several of them, I own one for quick tasks, my mom has one, Jared has one, Harry's mom has one. You get the idea. They make for good secondary machines or as main machines for basic web browsing. There's been a tradeoff between price -- Chromebooks start at around $200 -- and specs, but HP's latest offering sets it apart from earlier Chromebooks in a few ways. For starters, while many other cheap Chromebooks feature so-so screens, HP's model sports a nice-ish IPS (in-plane switching) screen for better viewing angles and more vivid color reproduction. Second, the Chromebook can be charged with a micro-USB cable -- the same kind used for most non-Apple smartphones. If you've a got an Android phone, for instance, you could get away with packing a single charger before you leave the house. And finally, there will be a model available later this year with a built-in 4G/LTE cellular connection. With the exception of the $1,300-and-up Chromebook Pixel, previous Chromebooks have only had a cellular option that used aging 3G networks. Design-wise, the HP Chromebook 11 sports similar internal specs to an earlier $250 Samsung model; both feature a mobile processor more commonly found in smartphones and tablets than portable computers. The idea is to offer better battery life, but there's an associated performance tradeoff. The machine has a 16-gigabyte solid state drive, two gigabytes of memory and HP claims battery life will last up to six hours. Weight is 2.3 pounds. HP's Chromebook is available now in a Wi-Fi-only version for $279. The 4G/LTE model will be available later this year. That's the one I'm most interested in for use a mobile reporting computer. Hopefully the price is right and the cellular data plan options aren't too outrageous. &copy 2012 TIME, Inc. TIME is a registered trademark of Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Myanmar released 56 political prisoners in a presidential amnesty, the government's official MRTV reported late Tuesday. The inmates were released from a dozen prisons, according to Tun Kyi, a member of government's committee on political prisoners. Most were charged under an unlawful association law, he said. In July, President Thein Sein said that there will be no prisoners of conscience in Myanmar by the end of the year. One month later, he stressed that while there will be no such prisoners, individuals found guilty of committing violent crimes for political reasons should still serve their sentences.

"(CNN) -- One of Australia's most colorful underworld figures and author, Mark ""Chopper"" Read -- whose cavalcade of violent crime put him behind bar for almost 23 years -- has died after a battle with liver cancer. ""I am deeply saddened to confirm the death of Mark Brandon Read, known widely throughout Australia and the world as 'Chopper',"" his manager, Andrew Parisi said in a statement carried by Australian media. The 58 year old was admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital recently with an ""ongoing and serious illness,"" Parisi said. Read was portrayed by Eric Bana in the 2000 film based on his exploits ""Chopper,"" and his autobiographical books have remained among Australia's best-selling true crime titles. His success in parlaying a life of crime into a lucrative media career -- he often toured with a stage show -- led to calls to extend Australia's Federal Proceeds of Crime Bill (2001), which confiscates the proceeds of drug deals and robberies, to include money from book deals and television appearances. Life of crime . Born in 1954 in Melbourne's tough northern suburbs, Read began his apprenticeship in crime in the 1970s by robbing massage parlors and taking on contracts to rob and maim rivals, obtaining what he called a ""doctorate"" as a ""stand over"" merchant. ""I once told a friend 'Why rob a straight guy of $20 when you can rob a drug dealer of $10,000 and he can't go running to the police',"" he said on his website, arguing that an honest man is more likely to put up a fight for a hard-earned $20 than a drug-dealer for thousands in fast cash from the proceeds of crime. Bullied at school and often on the receiving end in hundreds of fights, Read explained on his website that he learned to brawl on the streets of Melbourne's Prahran district, graduating to kidnapping and torturing underworld figures, sometimes using a blowtorch on their feet or removing their toes with bolt cutters to extort money. Famed for his peculiar brand of playground sadism, he said the electro-convulsive therapy he received as a teenager in mental institutions may have been responsible for some of his psychopathic tendencies. In prison gang fights, Read said he lost several feet of intestines and even had a fellow inmate cut off his ears so that he could get out of Pentridge Prison's high security H Division, according to his website. Read claimed to be involved in the killing of 19 people and the attempted murder of 11 others. In an interview with the New York Times in April, Read said ""Look, honestly, I haven't killed that many people, probably about four or seven, depending on how you look at it."" ""He's like this perfect cross between a complete psychopath and the crazy uncle you've got at your barbecue,"" his manager, Parisi, said, in quotes carried by the New York Times. Celebrity criminal . Political cartoonist for The Australian newspaper Bill Leak -- who met Read at a media engagement -- told CNN a long night on the town with the celebrity criminal ended true to the ""Chopper"" legend. ""I met Chopper for a drink and I skived off to play the pokies (slot machines), I must have put in all of $10 when I won some kind of jackpot and the management of the hotel gave me $1,500 in cash,"" said Leak, who spent the rest of the evening buying rounds of drinks for friends at the bar. The next day, somewhat worse for wear and after having offered Read a couch for the night, Leak awoke at 8 a.m. to find Read had already gone. ""He'd left this lovely note thanking me for my hospitality, saying I should contact him if I was ever in Melbourne,"" he said. ""Later that day I met a friend for lunch at a cafÃ© and when it came to the bill I thought there must be some change left from my winnings the night before but when I opened my wallet there wasn't one cent left -- Chopper had knocked it off! ""Working as I do for the media, everyone wanted to write the story but I didn't want it to get out: I simply thought I'd kept fast company and paid the price and put it down to that."" Weeks later, Leak received a letter from Chopper addressed to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). ""Everyone knew it was from Chopper so a small crowd gathered around me as I opened it up,"" he said. ""When I did 10 crisp $50 notes fell out and there was one of those Hallmark cards with a religious image on it that said 'Congratulations on your Ordination'. ""Inside he'd written 'Congratulations on your ordination into a very select group of people who've been pinched by Chopper Read and lived to tell the tale. I'm sorry Bill but I'm a hopeless kleptomaniac, especially after a few red wines. I'll nick anything if it's not bolted down, and if it is, I'll use a heavy vehicle to rip it off.' ""Of course , everyone standing around me fell about laughing."" 'Bull**** artist' He said while many of Chopper's exploits were well documented, he was well known for embellishing the truth. ""At one stage in the evening I told him I thought he was the biggest bull**** artist I'd ever met,"" Leak said. ""He suddenly stood up and towered over me and one of my friends thought 'Oh no, there's going to be blood and guts everywhere now.' ""Then he roared with laughter and said 'I'm not just the biggest bull**** artist you've ever met but probably the biggest one in Australia. Half the people I killed in my book are still walking around Melbourne today.""","Mark ""Chopper"" Read dies after battle with liver cancer, agent says .

"(CNN) -- Afraid that her husband will leave her for a younger woman, a 107-year-old Malaysian woman is looking to marry again -- for the 23rd time. Wok Kundor: ""I am an aged woman. I don't have the body nor am I a young woman who can attract anyone."" Wok Kundor has been happily married for four years to her husband, a man 70 years her junior. But since he left their village in northern Terengganu state for a drug rehabilitation program in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, Wok has had a gnawing feeling. ""She said that she has been feeling insecure lately and she needs to find out whether he still loves her or not,"" said R.S.N. Murali, a reporter for The Star. The English-language Malaysian daily was among several local media outlets reporting on the lifelong romantic. ""She is worried he might not come back after his program and find himself a younger wife,"" Murali said. If so, Wok has her eyes set on a 50-year-old man, but hopes it does not come to that. ""I realize that I am an aged woman. I don't have the body nor am I a young woman who can attract anyone,"" she told the newspaper. ""My intention to remarry is to fill my forlornness,"" particularly during the Muslim month of fasting, Ramadan, she said. Malaysian media, which has previously reported on the woman, said Wok has been married 22 times. That would make her marriages last an average of four years. Wok would not discuss past relationships, Murali said. ""Some of her better halves have passed away or have divorced, but she doesn't want to talk about them or her children,"" he said. Wok and her current husband, Mohammed Boor Che Musa, hail from the same village and met there. Muhammad, 37, was quoted in an earlier report as saying the couple fell for each other because it was ""God's will."" On Monday, he told The Star that he is still very much in love with his wife and cannot dream of life with someone else. But Wok wants to hear him say it, Murali said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray claimed he was giving up a $1-million-a-month medical practice to serve as Michael Jackson's doctor, a lawyer testified Tuesday. Kathy Jorrie, who negotiated and wrote the contract between AEG Live and Murray, was called as a witness in the wrongful death trial of the concert promoter. Murray, who agreed to work as Jackson's full-time physician for his comeback concerts for $150,000 a month, is serving a prison term for involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's drug overdose death. Michael Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending the concert promoter was liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray. Drug use explored in trial . Murray told Jorrie during negotiations that he was closing down four medical clinics that were making $1 million each month to take the job, Jorrie testified. Testimony in Murray's criminal trial revealed he only operated two clinics -- one in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the other in Houston, Texas. A Los Angeles Police detective testified earlier in this civil trial that Murray was more than $1 million in debt and that his Las Vegas medical clinic faced eviction in the months before he was hired to treat Jackson. Jackson lawyers argue AEG Live executives were negligent because they failed to check Murray's background, which they contend would have revealed his debts and misrepresentations about his successful practices. Michael Jackson trial: Who is Debbie Rowe? AEG Live executives testified that they relied on assurances by Jackson that Murray was his ""longtime personal doctor,"" concluding that he was competent for the tour position. A music industry veteran hired as an expert witness by Jackson lawyers testified earlier that AEG Live's negotiations with Murray were ""highly inappropriate."" The agreement to pay Murray $150,000 a month set up an ""egregious"" conflict of interest in which the physician was beholden to the company and himself before Jackson's interests, David Berman, who once headed Capitol Records and worked for decades as an entertainment lawyer, testified. The contractual relationship between AEG Live and Murray was ""not unlike the team doctor for a football team, where the quarterback is injured and the doctor comes to the medical conclusion that the quarterback should be taken out of the game for a period of weeks, but the team doesn't want him out,"" Berman said. ""There is an inherent conflict."" Bad news hurt Jackson's earning potential . Berman, called as an expert witness on music industry contracts, also noted that the contract said AEG Live could terminate Murray if concerts were postponed or canceled. ""The fact that if the tour is even just postponed that AEG Live has the ability to cease any further compensation for Dr. Murray, giving Dr. Murray even greater conflict of interest since he was in financial dire straits. He did need this gig and if it was postponed, which could hypothetically be in the best interest of Michael Jackson, he ran the risk of losing any further compensation,"" he testified. Berman testified that AEG Live executives should have recognized there could be a problem with Murray when he initially asked for $5 million for one year as Jackson's doctor. ""That is a pretty bizarre amount,"" he said. The eventual agreement to pay the doctor $150,000 a month was still ""an exorbitant amount, more than any other person on the tour was paid,"" he said. ""Even more of a red flag since AEG was aware of another doctor who was willing to take the job for $40,000 a month."" Murray told investigators that he gave Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol for two months to treat his insomnia. The coroner ruled Jackson died from a propofol overdose on June 25, 2009. The wrongful death trial, in its 15th week, is expected to continue into September.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- I think I stopped trusting the U.S. government right after learning that for 40 years, instead of treating a small group of poor, uneducated people officials had identified as having syphilis, officials not only withheld the diagnosis from them, but the cure as well, just to see what would happen if the disease went untreated. This was done even if what would happen was eventually death, which is why burial insurance was given to the unsuspecting victims as if the government was doing them a favor. And this didn't happen a very long time ago either. In fact, the first wave of Gen Xers were out of diapers while the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment was still going on. Once you see how hard Uncle Sam sucker punches people he identifies as expendable, you learn to keep your guard up whenever he comes around. It is for this reason that Social Security is nowhere in my retirement plans. Call me crazy, but the idea of trusting the government to take care of me, to provide me with ""security"" when I'm old and frail is far more frightening than the thought of me trying to make it on my own. I'm not yet 40, so theoretically I still have plenty of time to have my own plan in place. Yes, I've paid into Social Security. No, I don't expect to benefit from it, at least not at the level those who are currently collecting are benefiting. And I don't know anyone in any line of work my age or younger who does. We are not as mad about this switcheroo as much as we are mad that the reform can keeps getting kicked down a road that's getting shorter and shorter by a bunch of politicians who know better but are too afraid of losing voters who won't be around when the money's all gone anyway. Anybody with a high school diploma and a calculator can see how entitlement programs are damaging the economy and that some sort of reform is necessary to ensure their long-term solvency. And yet during budget and debt ceiling talks, Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid responded as if the Republicans wanted to sell voters' first-born babies into slavery. On Monday, President Barack Obama introduced another plan without touching Social Security. The Democrats won't even support the modest changes recommended by the president's own debt commission, including phasing in a two-year increase in the retirement age over the next 65 years and raising the ceiling on payroll taxes. They keep mocking us with talk of protecting the middle class when in reality protecting the middle class would have been passing a budget and introducing entitlement reforms before the extras from ""King of the Hill"" got into Congress. But just as GOP presidential candidates are saying whatever they can to appease their base (except for Jon Huntsman, which is why he is in last place), the Democrats are just as guilty of pandering to the home crowd, even if the desires of that crowd aren't nearly as much to blame for the economic trouble the country finds itself in as the Bush tax cuts and relaxed Wall Street regulations. It's all a game, and election after election, we keep getting played. Remember Obama didn't say he and the members of Congress might not get paid if the debt ceiling wasn't raised, but that Social Security and military checks may not go out. And he's the one being accused of being a socialist. Can you imagine what the rhetoric of a good ol' fashion free-market capitalist would sound like? Here's a hint: Rewatch the video from the CNN/Tea Party Republican Debate last week in which Wolf Blitzer asked if society should let an injured 30-year-old man without health insurance die. Much was made about the cheers that could be heard coming from some of the crowd, but I was far more disturbed by the lack of chastising that came from the stage immediately after the cheers. You mean to tell me the possible next leader of the free world doesn't have an instant rebuke to people who cheer at the mention of uninsured Americans dying? And I'm supposed to trust that person to have my best interest at heart when I'm at my most vulnerable? The Great Depression gave birth to Social Security. The Greatest Generation fed it and made it strong. Today the sheer number of the baby boomers is slowly strangling it to death. And because politicians continue to use Social Security as one of its many chess pieces to manipulate people to vote a certain way, one day we'll speak of it much in the same way we speak of dial-up Internet access. Only instead of laughing at how long it used to take to log on, we'll be shaking our heads, reminiscing back to the time when government actually cared. Except for me. As I hinted earlier, my faith in government went out the door the moment I found out it was controlled by people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: I'm not counting on collecting Social Security .
He says relying on government to protect you is a mistake .

"(CNN) -- The Mississippi River was closed at two different locations Thursday after a barge ran aground near Greenville, Mississippi, and the Army Corps of Engineers carried out dredging operations near La Crosse, Wisconsin. The Greenville closure affects a 10-mile stretch of the Lower Mississippi, according to Coast Guard spokesman Lt. JG McMillian. He said the incident represents the 24th closure his office has monitored in past weeks. Closures have become more routine this year, officials say, as last year's flooding may have worsened the situation by way of silt and other deposits of debris in areas that are normally clear. The traffic closures occurred just as a historic drought and excessive heat reduce water levels and scorch wide sections of the U.S. Midwest.

Anita Foster of the Red Cross said updated tallies show another 750 homes were damaged. Many families are still in shelters, unable to return to their homes, Foster said. ""We're dealing with a lot of emotional recovery, which will be just as challenging as the physical recovery,"" she said. With the potential for more severe storms Sunday, she said, the agency is focusing on preparation and advising people what to have in their disaster supply kits. ""We want people to think those things through while the sky is blue,"" she said. ""Things like a working flashlight, a first aid kit, a supply of water, and how to look after pets. We wanted to push those messages with more weather coming in, even if we just get one lightning bolt, that will be frightening for people who just went through this."" Argentina storm kills more than a dozen . An estimated 13 tornadoes touched down in Dallas, Arlington and the surrounding area Tuesday, the National Weather Service in Dallas-Fort Worth said Thursday. There have been no reports of deaths from the storms. At least one of the twisters rated up to EF-3, the weather service said. That tornado, in the town of Forney, east of Dallas, had a wind speed as high as 150 mph, it said. Tornadoes can rate up to an EF-5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which uses damage to calculate the storm's rating. Other tornadoes that touched down in the area Tuesday rated EF-1 and EF-2, according to the weather service. Belinda Price, who with her husband runs a day care at her home in Forney, protected 15 children in the closet of her home as the tornado approached. Her husband filmed the tan-colored funnel cloud as it approached their neighborhood. ""My first thought was, I have to keep these children safe,"" Price told HLN on Thursday. ""I gave them instructions: When I tell you to run, you run, and you run where I tell you to run."" Some of the children cried, but for the most part, she said, they kept cool. Price knelt in the closet covering a 4-month-old and said there was barely room for herself. ""There is no doubt in my mind that God covered us,"" she told CNN affiliate KTVT.

"(CNN) -- Officials are monitoring a remote Alaska volcano that could launch an ash cloud, potentially threatening intercontinental flights. ""Eruptive activity"" of Cleveland Volcano was detected in satellite data, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The volcano, also known as Mount Cleveland, is on the Aleutian Islands, southwest of mainland Alaska. ""A new lava dome has been observed in the summit crater,"" the observatory said Tuesday. ""There have been no observations of ash emissions or explosive activity during this current lava eruption."" But the volcanic activity could heighten and affect air travel, said Steve McNutt, a scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. McNutt said 90% of air freight from Asia to Europe and North America flies over Alaska air space, and hundreds of flights -- including more than 20,000 passengers -- fly through Anchorage's air space daily. ""If there is an explosion and (ash) reaches high altitudes, it will causes flights to be rerouted and ultimately canceled,"" McNutt said. The volcano's most recent significant eruption took place in 2001. It produced three explosions that led to ash clouds as high as 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) above sea level, according to the volcano observatory. ""The 2001 eruption also produced a rubbly lava flow and hot avalanche that reached the sea,"" the observatory said. Last year, volcanic ash spewing from Iceland's Grimsvotn volcano forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights across Europe. The Grimsvotn eruption came about 13 months after Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano belched smoke and ash into the skies, forcing the cancellation of thousands of flights per day at the peak of the problem.","Mount Cleveland is on the Aleutian Islands, southwest of mainland Alaska .

"(CNN) -- Chilean authorities on Sunday issued a red alert -- the most severe in their warning system -- that the Copahue Volcano, high in the Andes mountains on the border with Argentina, might be poised for a significant eruption. In a statement, Chile's Geological and Mining Service stressed that no mandatory evacuations have been ordered around the remote volcano, which lies about 280 kilometers southeast (175 miles) of Concepcion, though the closest roads to it are in Argentina. Even though the seismic activity suggests a minor eruption, the agency decided to raise the alert level because it could not rule out a major eruption. The service warned specifically about potentially dangerous mudslides within a 15-kilometer (9.3-mile) radius of the crater. Alto Biobio, a community about 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of Copahue, is under the heightened alert. The governor and emergency officials in Biobio province met Sunday afternoon to discuss possible scenarios, including establishing a plan in case a mass evacuation is deemed necessary. Seismic stations first detected increased activity Saturday, according to the Volcano Observatory of the Southern Andes, which is part of Chile's Geological and Mining Service. In addition, more gas than normal has been detected coming from the volcano. The black, ash-filled gas has soared as 1.5 kilometers (almost 1 mile) above Copahue and extended 13 kilometers (8 miles) out from it, toward the southeast. Known in South America as Volcan Copahue, this volcano formed about 500,000 years ago and contains a string of nine craters in this stretch of the Andes, according to the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program. Its summit is just less than 3000 meters, or 9,830 feet, above sea level. Mild to moderate eruptions have been recorded here since the 18th century, and some in the 20th century spewed volcanic rocks and chilled liquid sulfur fragments from its 300-meter wide crater lake, the Global Volcanism Program reports. After at least three eruptions during the 1990s, Copahue's last significant eruption occurred from July to October 2000. That incident caused damage, mudslides and spurred evacuations.

"(CNN) -- Leaking gas was likely to blame for an explosion that killed at least 12 people, injured 60 more and brought down part of a building in Argentina on Tuesday, state media reported Wednesday. A man who was working at the scene in the city of Rosario before the blast ignited at 9:15 a.m. local time has been taken into custody, said the Telam news agency, which cited investigator Juan Curto. The explosion gutted one multi-story residential building, and destroyed at least one other building next to it, while blowing out the windows of surrounding structures, images broadcast by CNN affiliate Canal 9 showed. A swath of white smoke and dust dominated the skyline of the city, located about 200 miles northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires. Firefighters swung extended ladders around to upper balconies and windows to rescue residents stranded on top floors. Rubble and shards of glass filled the streets below, as fire engines arrived Tuesday to douse the blaze, and medical teams tended to bleeding victims. Rescuers are still searching for over a dozen people who were in the residential building at the time of the blast, local newspaper Clarin reported. CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote in Atlanta .","Leaking gas is likely to blame, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Tired of seeing developed nations take the lion's share of profits from his countrymen's coffee crop, Ugandan businessman Andrew Rugasira decided back in 2003 that it was time for a new business arrangement. Uganda is Africa's second-biggest exporter of coffee beans, currently producing around 3.4 million bags per year. Yet instead of being refined locally, the vast majority of the country's raw beans have been traditionally exported in the consuming countries of the West for processing. But Rugasira's vision was to create a quality Ugandan coffee company that would be able to place a finished product on the shelves of both local and international supermarkets. A trained economist, he devised a business model encouraging local coffee farmers to sell their beans to him at a fair price. His company would then roast, package and brand the final product, whilst the profits would be split 50/50. Read this: Female boss who took on drinks giant . ""The hard part was saying, 'look, I think as Africans we need to begin to look at ourselves as a solution to some of these problems of systemic poverty and underdevelopment. We have blessed soils, you guys have a commodity which is of great value,"" says Rugasira, recalling his first meetings to convince the farmers in Uganda's Kasese district. ""We can pay you a premium price; we can also add value to your knowledge; we can help train you; we can set up savings and credit co-ops and we can really work together and begin to own the value chain which is historically being controlled outside the producer country. ""We needed to change that -- and through trade we could bring prosperity to our farmers and their communities."" Read this: Ugandan midwife, Nobel Peace Prize? These words by Rugasira planted the seeds for what went on to become Good African Coffee, a Kampala-based company that has helped transform the lives of thousands of farmers in Uganda. Over the last nine years Good African Coffee says it has built a network of more than 14,000 coffee farmers, who are organized into 280 farmer groups. The company, which is the first African-owned coffee brand to be available in British supermarkets, has also helped local farmers to set up several savings and credit cooperatives. ""(It's) about empowerment and it's also about ownership,"" says Rugasira. ""It's about owning the value chain, growing the coffee, processing it at source and it's about exporting a finished product,"" he adds. ""So we retain the value, which means we can employ people, we can pay taxes, we can prosper our farmers and their communities. And that's the only sustainable way in which societies have prospered -- by moving from low-value agriculture into high-value manufacturing industrialization."" At the heart of all of Rugasira's efforts is his strong belief in the transformative power of self-help. In trade, and not aid, he says, is where Africa's future well-being lies. ""Every society and economy that's prospered has done it through their own hard work, ingenuity, dedication and commitment,"" he says. ""Not through charity, not through handouts, and I think that's a powerful message and it's a powerful model. It's not new, but I think it's one that I think resonates with consumers who are willing to interact with products like that."" Watch this: Dambisa Moyo on aid . Rugasira's philosophy is clearly defined in ""A Good African Story,"" his book published earlier this year chronicling all the challenges he and his enterprise faced -- from gaining the trust of banking institutions to convincing foreign retailers about working directly with an African company. He says he decided to write the book because just a handful of African businesspeople write about their experiences. ""All of us have a story,"" he says. ""We need to share that story; that story edifies, it encourages, it inspires others in our own way and I just found African business doesn't really write."" By sharing his story with the world, Rugasira wants to help create a new narrative about Africa and inspire the continent's next generation of entrepreneurs. ""Seventy percent of our population on the continent are young people -- the same young people that we want to set up businesses, become entrepreneurs, innovators in IT, you name it,"" he says. ""And the only way they'll be encouraged and inspired is if they read about stories about other African business people.""","Ugandan businessman Andrew Rugasira is the founder of Good African Coffee .

"(CNN) -- We've never seen a more rapt group of people hovering over salt-crusted sea bass. To kick off season 2 of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, CNN hosted a whirlwind scavenger hunt in Hong Kong last weekend, in association with Little Adventures in Hong Kong, the city's premier private food tour company. We sent 12 teams racing through restaurants, streets and market stalls on an intense foodie-themed series of challenges, with Anthony Bourdain judging the challenge remotely via Instagram and Twitter. Chefs and judges were stationed at various locations to preside over each endeavor. Sweet odds . It may have been the one in six odds of winning, but the race was hilariously intense from the beginning. With challenges ranging from eating as many ""suicide wings"" as possible in three minutes to wrapping dim sum to fileting fish, six local teams and six expat teams battled it out to win two grand prizes of a trip to Tokyo, and customized food tours of Hong Kong with Little Adventures for runners up. Anthony Bourdain judged the roast goose leg challenge -- it's his favorite Hong Kong food -- that had teams hunting for a secret kitchen to chop up goose legs. ""You really get to see why Hong Kong is Asia's food capital,"" food blogger Andy Yeo of team The Twits said of the day's event. ""It pushes you off the deep end."" Hunger in Hong Kong . The tests weren't all about taste buds. The Market Challenge had each team heading to the street market to bargain for as much choi sum (a leafy green vegetable) as possible for HK$30, the average amount people in Hong Kong living under the poverty line spend on food each day. The veggies were then donated to Feeding Hong Kong, CNN's charity partner for the event. Social media was another important element of the contest, as contestants were required to have a Twitter and Instagram account to register. Despite rampant competitiveness, CNN Travel editor Hiufu Wong observed that contestants spent more time feeding the event to their social media networks than on the actual challenges. The winners . The winners heading to Tokyo are teams HELL YEAH! and HUNGER HUNTER. ""We liked the fact that the challenge covered not just local Cantonese food,"" said Davis Ng, member of team HELL YEAH!

"New Orleans (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Isaac neared hurricane strength Monday night, closing on the Gulf Coast with a projected landfall a day short of the seventh anniversary of the devastating Hurricane Katrina. Isaac was forecast to strike land south of New Orleans on Tuesday night, perhaps as a Category 1 hurricane with top winds of about 90 mph. The Katina anniversary was leaving much of the Gulf Coast with ""a high level of anxiety,"" as New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu put it Monday. Residents of low-lying coastal areas from the Florida Panhandle to southeastern Louisiana were ordered to evacuate ahead of storm surges and heavy rain, while Landrieu acknowledged his own jitters due to the coincidence. Isaac is expected to be weaker than Katrina, which came ashore as a Category 3 hurricane with 125-mph winds. But New Orleans could start to feel tropical storm force winds by midnight Monday, and while Isaac may veer off its currently projected course, ""It seems to be settling into a pathway and a speed that is becoming predictable,"" Landrieu said. ""It is quite ironic that we have a hurricane threatening us on the seventh anniversary of Katrina,"" he said. But he added that as of Monday afternoon, ""There is nothing this storm will bring us that we are not capable of handling."" Most of Katrina's nearly 1,800 deaths occurred when the protective levees around New Orleans failed, flooding the city. But Landrieu said the levees have had $10 billion in improvements since 2005, and the city's pump stations have backup generators ready in case of electrical outages. One of those stations is the biggest in the world and some can move as much as 150,000 gallons per second. ""This is the best system that the greater New Orleans area has ever seen,"" Col. Ed Fleming of the Army Corps of Engineers said. Preparing for Isaac, state by state . Isaac faltered a bit in the Gulf of Mexico as an eye wall that had been forming appeared to break up Monday afternoon, slowing its development, National Hurricane Center Deputy Director Ed Rappaport told CNN. As of 11 p.m. ET, its top winds remained 70 mph -- just under hurricane strength -- and it was expected to become a hurricane ""Monday night or early Tuesday,"" the Miami-based hurricane center reported. Isaac was centered about 190 miles (305 kilometers) southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and it was moving to the northwest at 10 mph. But tropical-storm-force winds extended more than 200 miles from the center, and hurricane warnings stretched from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida border. Tropical storm warnings extended eastward to Destin, Florida, and westward from Morgan City to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, about 150 miles west of New Orleans. There was also the potential for a lot of rain, as much as 18 inches in a few areas of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the hurricane center said. As the storm heads north, its rain would benefit some drought-ravaged states like Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana and Missouri. Landrieu has not ordered an evacuation of his city, most of which is below sea level and protected by a network of levees. But he said he would ""strongly urge"" about 900 people who live outside the levee system to leave -- and if anyone else is thinking about getting out, ""now would be a good time to go."" Live blog: Isaac moves in . Others in low-lying Louisiana parishes and in coastal counties and barrier islands of Mississippi, Alabama and northwest Florida were told to clear out ahead of the storm. In Alabama, state Emergency Management Agency Director Art Faulkner warned that strong winds and high water may affect the Mobile area even if the storm hits as far west as Louisiana. ""It is a very large storm,"" Faulkner said. ""And oftentimes we confuse and focus on a specific dot that may be identified as the center of the storm when very dangerous conditions may exist as far as 200 miles from that specific dot."" The storm lashed Cuba and the Florida Keys over the weekend after slamming into Haiti, where at least 19 people had been reported dead by Monday, the country's civil protection agency reported. The Hurricane Center projected storm surges of 3 to 6 feet for the Florida Panhandle, 6 to 9 feet for the Alabama coast and 6 to 12 feet for the Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana shores. In Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, Hancock County authorities ordered residents of low-lying areas to evacuate Monday evening. The National Park Service had already ordered visitors to leave the barrier islands off the Mississippi coast. Jackson County, which includes the coastal cities of Pascagoula, Gautier and Ocean Springs, ordered evacuations for anyone living south of U.S. Highway 90 -- a major artery along the Mississippi coast -- or for those living in mobile homes, along rivers and in other vulnerable areas. ""Those residents that experienced flooding during Hurricane Katrina should evaluate what the effects of the possible 8-12 foot tidal surge would have to their property and make an informed decision with regard to evacuation,"" a message from the county Board of Supervisors added. But on Dauphin Island, south of Mobile, many residents were preparing to sit out Isaac at home, said Alexa Alexander. ""We are boarding up (and) getting supplies ready,"" said Alexander, who lives and tends bar on the island. ""We've had a little bit of people leave Dauphin Island, but not much. Most of the locals are going to ride it out."" Dauphin Island was badly damaged by Katrina, which cut the island in half -- a gouge since filled by sand and rock. The skies there were just clouding up Monday afternoon, Alexander said. Louisiana resident Ryan Unger plans to stay in place despite an evacuation order. He filled up gas tanks Sunday night in case he has to run his generator. ""Starting to get a little sense of anxiety, like, OK, am I ready for it?"" he said. ""Realizing we ain't really ready for a storm. So we're just all thinking about what we gotta do to get in place to get ready for it."" Residents of St. Charles Parish and parts of Jefferson Parish and Plaquemines Parish in Louisiana had been ordered to clear out as well. Some 9,000 residents in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, were ordered to evacuate Monday morning, along with the towns of Jean Lafitte, Crown Point and Barataria. ""We're worried about tidal surge,"" Jean Lafitte Mayor Tim Kerner said. Airports across the region also made plans to shut down as the storm passed. New Orleans will shut its international airport after its last flight Monday night, spokesman Ryan Berni said, while smaller airports in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida also announced closures starting Tuesday. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called on residents in coastal parishes prone to flooding to voluntarily evacuate. Even pro football player Courtney Roby of the New Orleans Saints was a little nervous. ""Kinda a scary feeling of uncertainty,"" he said via Twitter. Disaster dining: How to stay safe and stay fed in a storm . Mississippi officials dispatched 1,500 National Guard troops to the state's three southern counties to help with emergency operations, as well as 45 state troopers to ease traffic flow. The state has distributed 10,000 sandbags to residents ahead of the storm. ""In short, we have done everything in our power to be prepared for the storm,"" Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said. In the coastal Mississippi city of Pass Christian, people were moving their boats to higher ground and preparing their homes. ""Lookin' like we're gonna be ground zero again,"" said Daryl Vaught, as he prepared to place sandbags in front of his doors and garage. ""It seems like Katrina just happened yesterday,"" Vaught told CNN affiliate WDSU. ""Hopefully we'll dodge a bullet here this time. I didn't last time."" iReport: Isaac pounds Ft. Lauderdale beach . It appeared Monday that the storm's ferocity would mostly bypass Florida's west coast and the Republican National Convention in Tampa, where the schedule was pushed back a day by organizers over concerns about the storm.

"(CNN) -- A series of car bombs ripped through parts of Baghdad Monday evening, killing at least 28 people and wounding dozens in the latest deadly incident in violence-torn Iraq, police said. Nine car bombs detonated in the Iraqi capital, at least some of them in several Shiite Muslim neighborhoods. In addition to those killed, at least 106 were injured, police said. ""Yes, another day of coordinated attacks in the capital,"" police Capt. Ali al-Lami told CNN. It wasn't clear who was responsible, he added. Monday's violence came after at least 88 people were killed and more than 300 were injured in bombings and other attacks throughout the country on Saturday and Sunday, according to police officials. The weekend attacks prompted a U.N. envoy to call on the nation's leaders to take action to stop the ""accelerated surge in violence and bloodshed."" More than 5,000 civilians have died and 12,000 have been wounded in terrorist attacks and other violence in Iraq in 2013, the U.N. Mission in Iraq reported last month. The region around Baghdad has been the hardest-hit, the agency said. The United Nations has said 979 Iraqis were killed and 2,133 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence last month alone. ""In the aftermath of yet another series of bloody attacks that indiscriminately hit pilgrims, schoolchildren, journalists, as well as ordinary citizens trying to go about their daily lives, the special representative of the United Nations secretary-general for Iraq, Mr. Nickolay Mladenov, called on political, religious and civil leaders to work together with the security forces and take joint action to halt the accelerated surge in violence and bloodshed,"" the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq said in a statement issued Sunday. Iraq has been struggling with deep sectarian divisions between its Shiite and Sunni populations, as well as the ethnic divisions between Arabs and minorities such as Kurds. Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Sunnis, who represent a minority of Iraqis, have felt politically marginalized since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Shiites, who make up a majority of Iraqis, now dominate the government. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Police: At least nine car combs detonate in Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad .
