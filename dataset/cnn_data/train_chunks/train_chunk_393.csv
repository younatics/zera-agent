"At the Exploratorium, one does not stand stiffly in front of musty exhibits and read tiny placards. There is no room for boredom or passively observing. The installations at this interactive science museum are hands on -- they require touching, building, playing, experimenting and thinking. And in the Exploratorium's shiny new space, the experience is just as much for adults as it is for children. On Wednesday, the doors open on the Exploratorium's first new home in its 44 years, the $300 million renovated Pier 15 on the Embarcadero, San Francisco's eastern stretch of waterfront. It is three times larger than the old museum, the cavernous exhibit hall at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts, which was originally built for the 1915 World's Fair. The Exploratorium was originally opened in that location in 1969 by physicist Frank Oppenheimer. The new quarters have taken the original spirit and contents of the old Exploratorium and given them a sophisticated makeover. The building has sweeping views of San Francisco Bay, the city skyline and the Bay Bridge's new nightly light show. Though the Exploratorium costs up to $25 to enter, the 330,000-square-foot museum is rimmed with free public space: a wind sculpture, a giant sundial and wooden pylons in the water that track the tides and colors of the bay. A bridge next to the pier doubles as an art installation, enveloping the area in a thick artificial fog once an hour. Inside, 600 exhibits fill the bright space, about 400 of which made the move from the old location. Some old favorites are dusted off and given new life, like a wonderful giant concave mirror that plays tricks on the eyes and the ears. A brand new exhibit that's bound to be a hit lets you recreate past rainstorms, down to the size and speed of the raindrops. The installations dabble in every scientific discipline, including electricity, sensory perception, weather, light, astronomy and sociology. They employ everything from magnets, pendulums and electricity to dancing, awkward social interactions, algae and a cow eyeball. There are artificial tornadoes in glass tubes, a creepy video art installation, a cooperative Pac-Man game, and a place to send text messages to fish. The exhibits stimulate the brain without requiring any right or wrong answer, happy to leave the lessons open to interpretation. ""The Exploratorium is really a laboratory,"" said senior scientist Ron Hipschman, who has been with the Exploratorium for 41 years. ""We're not making objects. We're making activities; we're doing."" The culture of the Exploratorium has long been intertwined with the Maker Faire, the Bay Area festival that celebrates do-it-yourself projects. And its new shop, tinkering space and learning space expand on that maker spirit. The area where exhibits are tested and built with an impressive collection of large machinery is situated at the heart of the museum, now completely open so anyone can watch and chat up the staff and students at work. Tinkering and learning spaces invites visitors to build their own creations, such as animations or elaborate paths for marbles, while teenage employees in orange vests circulate around the floor to offer guidance. The best new additions focus on the Bay Area's history and ecology. A new glass observatory at the end of the pier has killer views and exhibits specific to the location, such as tactile displays explaining the tides and the bay's unique weather systems. Even the building itself is a giant science experiment. There are sensors all around, in the nearby water and on the roof, that collect scientific data such as the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide in the bay. This is gathered to track ocean acidification and shared with schools and scientific institutions. All the data will also be available for free on the Exploratorium's website. Furthermore, the Exploratorium aspires to make the pier a net zero building, meaning it will eventually generate as much energy as it uses. It has 6,000 solar panels on the roof that can generate 1.3 megawatts of power, and it uses seawater from the bay to cool and heat the building. The staff is still getting acquainted with the new space and discovering the best ways to manage power, such as identifying the most efficient times to open and close the window shades. One early discovery: It's cheaper and easier to pump in the seawater during high tide. Education remains a major focus of the Exploratorium, which hosts webcasts, builds apps, trains science teachers and sells exhibits to other museums around the world. At the front of the building, a new forum will host music events, movie nights and science lectures. When the doors open on Wednesday morning, crowds of fans will find that the unique atmosphere, which people loved about the original Exploratorium, made the move intact.","San Francisco's Exploratorium reopens Wednesday in a $300 million new home .

"Exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky's death is ""consistent with hanging"" with no sign of a violent struggle, British investigators announced late Monday. The 67-year-old Berezovsky was found dead at a country estate south of London over the weekend, triggering speculation about the fate of a onetime tycoon known for his opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""The results of the post-mortem examination, carried out by a Home Office pathologist, have found the cause of death is consistent with hanging,"" Thames Valley police reported. ""The pathologist has found nothing to indicate a violent struggle."" Investigators are still waiting for toxicology test results, which could take several weeks, the statement said. And the house in Ascot will remain under guard while investigators continue to probe his death, police added. He was found in the locked bathroom of a guest suite, police confirmed. Police scouring the scene Sunday said they had not found any sign of ""third-party involvement,"" a detective said. Speculation about Berezovsky's cause of death ran the gamut from suicide to heart attack with some pointing to his declining fortune as a possible clue. He is believed to have been in serious financial difficulties after running up huge legal fees in recent years, including what was reportedly Britain's biggest-ever divorce settlement and a losing lawsuit against a former friend and ally, Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. A close family friend, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, said that Berezovsky was found dead by a bodyguard -- a former member of the Israeli spy agency Mossad, as Berezovsky's bodyguards all were. He normally had three, but only one was working at the time he died, the friend said. The home where Berezovsky died is owned by his ex-wife Galina, the friend said, but Berezovsky had been staying there for a month because few people knew how to reach him there. He believed his houses were bugged had repeatedly re-written his will over the last few years; in addition, the source said, he had discussed the importance of returning to Russia and was contemplating having his body repatriated to his homeland. He was not on medication, as far as the source was aware. Another source characterized Berezovsky's finances as ""an immediate liquidity squeeze, but long-term, he had assets."" Over the weekend, close associates had denied that Berezovsky may have committed suicide, Russia's state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported. The agency said a family friend told Russian media that Berezovsky had suffered a heart attack. The colorful Berezovsky had been a Moscow math professor and systems analyst before the Soviet Union broke apart in 1991. In the freewheeling era that followed, he made a fortune selling cars and parlayed those riches into political influence by buying into Russian media outlets. He supported Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first post-Soviet president, and was an early backer of Putin. But after winning his Kremlin office in 2000, Putin's government began trying to collect on tax claims against ""oligarchs"" like Berezovsky. Berezovsky fled Russian and began agitating against Putin from Britain, calling for a coup to oust the Russian president. In 2003, as Russia was seeking his return, Berezovsky was granted political asylum by British authorities after they realized he was wanted on political grounds, not criminal ones, according to published reports at the time. The case strained relations between Moscow and London. Berezovsky was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in absentia by a Russian court in 2007. Berezovsky also blamed the Kremlin for the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned by radioactive material in London. For years, Berezovsky bankrolled the effort of Litvinenko's widow to push for an inquest into her husband's death. In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Putin, an accusation the Kremlin strongly denied. Moscow is ready to consider burying him in Russia, if it receives such a request, Russian media said, quoting presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.","Berezovsky was in ""an immediate liquidity squeeze"" but had assets, friend says .

"Witnesses say as many as 500 migrants died in the Mediterranean Sea when human traffickers intentionally sunk their boat, the International Organization for Migration said Tuesday. The survivors -- both Palestinian men from Gaza who were rescued separately after days in the water clinging to flotation aids -- said they had packed into a boat in Egypt's port of Damietta in Egypt and left on September 6. They estimated at least 400 men and women, in addition to as many as 100 children, were on board. Two survivors interviewed by the IOM and Italian police in Sicily said the traffickers became enraged after the migrants -- who had already switched to small boats three times during their four days at sea -- refused to move to a smaller vessel. The migrants said they'd rather go back to Egypt than continue on in an even smaller vessel that they believed  was not seaworthy. The Palestinians' account was corroborated by several other survivors who were interviewed on the Greek island of Crete, the IOM said. They said the smugglers, who they said were Palestinians and Egyptians, had begun yelling and throwing sticks at the migrants after they refused to leave the boat before then ramming the vessel. Some migrants managed to jump into the smaller boat, while one passenger ""killed himself in despair by hanging,"" a survivor said. ""After they hit our boat, they waited to make sure that it had sunk completely before leaving. They were laughing,"" he added. IOM: Many children among dead . By Tuesday morning, authorities in Italy, Malta and Greece confirmed the rescue of 10 migrants from the lost vessel, the IOM said. Three bodies have also been found. Those on the boat included Syrians, Palestinians, Egyptians and Sudanese, the witnesses said. The two Palestinian survivors explained that they'd paid $2,000 -- money they'd gotten after receiving grants to rebuild their homes -- at what they called a ""travel"" office in Gaza for their voyage to Italy, according to the IOM. Four buses took them to the Egyptian port near Alexandria, where about 200 people got on the ship's first deck and the other 300 people on the bottom deck. Survivors surmised that those below deck were unable to escape the sinking boat and drowned almost immediately. Some people managed to stay afloat for three days, only to be done in by strong winds and waves that moved through the area. '""If survivors' reports are confirmed, this will be the worst shipwreck of migrants in years, not an accidental tragedy, but the apparent deliberate drowning of migrants by criminal gangs who extort money for their desperate journeys,"" said IOM spokesman Leonard Doyle. ""Their actions are as callous as they are evil."" Italian navy finds dozens of bodies in migrant boat . 'Shocking and unacceptable' According to the IOM, the latest reported sinking would take the death toll off Europe's shores this year to nearly 3,000. In 2013, the organization's Missing Migrants Project estimated the total for the year to be 700 deaths. ""The numbers dying off Europe's coasts are shocking and unacceptable,"" said IOM director general William Lacy Swing. ""These are women, children and men who only hope for a more dignified life. The risks they take reflect their desperation and we cannot keep abandoning them to their fate."" Authorities are also investigating reports that 200 more people are missing off Libya and that another 15 drowned off the coast of Egypt, the IOM said. Each year, tens of thousands of people are rescued from the Mediterranean, according to the European Union border agency, Frontex. The United Nations has expressed dismay over the rising number of migrants dying at sea.","Two survivors say they'd paid $2,000 at a ""travel"" office in Gaza for their voyage to Italy .

"The NBA's commissioner came down hard Tuesday on Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, ordering him out of his team's business and pushing to force him to sell over racist remarks that caused a firestorm since becoming public days ago. Adam Silver detailed Sterling's punishment of a lifetime ban and $2.5 million fine -- the ""maximum amount"" allowed per league guidelines -- at a press conference eight hours before Sterling's Clippers were to tip off in the fifth game of a tightly contested first-round playoff series with the Golden State Warriors. Silver's decision was met with immediate support from NBA owners, players and others connected to the league who have been calling for swift, firm punishment ever since TMZ posted audio featuring the incendiary comments. ""I hope that every bigot in this country sees what happened to Mr. Sterling and recognizes that if he can fall, so can you,"" Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a former NBA All-Star who was tasked with leading the NBA players union's efforts on this matter. Sterling scandal: Silver's moment to shine . Under the lifetime ban, Sterling is prohibited from attending NBA games or practices, stepping foot inside any Clippers' facility, taking part in business or personnel decisions, or having a role in league activities such as attending NBA Board of Governors meetings. Silver -- who succeeded longtime NBA leader David Stern in February -- also insisted he will do ""everything in my power"" to compel the NBA Board of Governors to ""force a sale"" of the Clippers. The commissioner said ""I fully expect"" to get the needed three-quarters of the league's owners --  meaning at least 23 -- to back the move, though Sterling could fight any such move in court. If Sterling does sell the team, he stands to profit considerably: He bought the Clippers for $12 million in 1981, and the team is now worth $575 million, according to Forbes magazine. And he'd likely have plenty of suitors: Among them is Hollywood mogul David Geffen, who spokeswoman Priscila Giraldo says is ""interested"" in buying the team. Rather than water cooler discussions of exciting NBA playoff action, people are talking about racist remarks by a team owner, said Gabe Feldman, head of Tulane University's sports law program. Estimating the team may be worth closer to $1 billion, Feldman added, ""He may get a lot of money from the sale, but I think it will allow the NBA to shift their focus."" What ban means for Clipper finances . That's what Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Tuesday night, commending Silver as ""fantastic"" for making ""a decision that really was the right one."" While the players aren't rejoicing, they are breathing easier knowing what happened earlier in the day, he said. ""They were just happy that it was a resolution,"" Rivers said, expressing hope that playing the game will be a ""safe haven"" for all involved. ""... We're all in a better place because of this."" Clippers: 'Now the healing process begins' The inflammatory sentiments Silver referred to came packaged in a 10-minute recording that TMZ said occurred during an April 9 conversation between Sterling and girlfriend V. Stiviano. On the recording, a man and woman argue about photos posted to Instagram in which she appears with African-Americans. The man says he doesn't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her. The sports website Deadspin on Sunday posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording. Neither website has said how it obtained the recordings; Stiviano's lawyer's office said Sunday that she didn't release them to TMZ, while stating they are legitimate. On Saturday, Clippers President Andy Roeser suggested the audio was aimed at ""getting even"" with Sterling over a lawsuit. Rochelle Sterling filed a lawsuit last month against Stiviano, who she said was having an affair with her husband and accusing Stiviano of going after extremely wealthy older men. Roeser said that the offensive comments are ""not consistent with, nor does it reflect (Sterling's) views, beliefs or feelings."" Moreover, he cast doubt as to whether Sterling had made them, stating: ""We do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered."" Silver expressed no such doubts Tuesday, saying the Clippers owner ""acknowledged it was his voice on the tape."" Asked whether the owner expressed any remorse, the commissioner said, ""Mr. Sterling has not expressed those views directly to me."" Moments after Silver's press conference concluded, the Clippers struck a different tone. ""We wholeheartedly support and embrace the decision by the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver today,"" the team said. ""Now the healing process begins."" Silver says he shares sponsors' 'outrage' There is no question that Sterling rightfully owns the Clippers. Some observers question how comments, made privately, could serve as grounds for such punishment, including possibly forcing him to sell the team. Yet while there's no precedent in the NBA, there is in other sports. In the 1990s, Major League Baseball repeatedly suspended Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott over racist and other controversial comments, and she ultimately sold the franchise. Silver said Tuesday he'd ""let the lawyers"" address specifics, while stating flatly, ""We have the authority to act as I've recommended."" Feldman said some owners might be wary of setting a precedent in which anyone can be voted out ""just based on something they don't like, whether it was said privately or just said publicly."" That view notwithstanding, NBA owners universally backed Silver's judgment in statements Tuesday. If the owners follow through on the commissioner's recommendation to force him to sell, Sterling could fight back in the courts. But should he file a lawsuit, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says his chances of success seem ""basically zero."" Sterling so far hasn't had found support in the court of public opinion, especially among past and present players. Members of his own team, the Clippers, debated boycotting their playoff game Saturday with the Warriors, according to coach Rivers. They decided against it, instead opting to stage a silent protest by removing their warmup shirts bearing team logos to reveal red T-shirts worn inside out, with the logos hidden. Silver said he talked to Rivers, Clippers star point guard Chris Paul (who is also the players union president) and other players prior to reaching his decision Tuesday morning. Dollars talked, too, to ramp up the pressure for Silver to act. Over a dozen companies -- including State Farm, Virgin America, CarMax and Red Bull -- halted their sponsorships with the Clippers over the remarks, CNN Money reported. Speaking Tuesday, the commissioner said he shares these companies ""outrage,"" adding ""it will take some time"" to get things right. Clippers sponsors jump ship . ""I can understand how upset they are, and I'll do my best to bring them back into the NBA family,"" Silver said. For some, his decision to ban Sterling was enough. Both Adidas and Samsung announced later Tuesday that they had renewed their ""partnerships"" in the wake of the owner's public punishment. Warriors coach Mark Jackson, who a day earlier urged fans to boycott Tuesday's game and said there was ""a real discussion among the players"" to do the same so long as Sterling remained in charge, thinks Silver gave everyone enough reason now to come out to a game. ""I thought he was absolutely incredible ... with the way that he took control of the moment,"" Jackson said of the commissioner before his team's playoff showdown in Los Angeles. ""... It was exactly what the doctor ordered."" Five key players in the Donald Sterling uproar . Magic Johnson: Players are 'very happy and satisfied' One man thrust into the controversy -- seemingly out of the blue -- was NBA great Magic Johnson. In the TMZ recording, the man seems mad about a photo the woman posted to Instagram with Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" the man says. ""If it's white people, it's OK?"" she responds. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?"" Bird was Johnson's chief rival when Bird's  Boston Celtics and Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers ruled the NBA. ""I've known (Magic Johnson) well, and he should be admired. ... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately,"" the man on the recording says. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games."" After the audio went public, Johnson -- who, since retiring from basketball, has become a successful businessman and part owner of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers -- expressed dismay and insisted he'd never attend a Clippers game so long as Sterling was the owner. Johnson offered a very different tune Tuesday, commending Silver for exhibiting ""great leadership"" in saying he and others ""are very happy and satisfied."" ""I wish I was in LA, I would be at the Clipper game tonight!"" he tweeted. Sterling has history of fighting discrimination claims in court .

"We're leaving. No, you're not. That's where the crisis in Ukraine stood Thursday after lawmakers in Crimea voted in favor of leaving the country for Russia and putting it to a regional vote in 10 days. This act drew widespread condemnation, with Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk calling such a referendum ""an illegitimate decision."" ""Crimea was, is and will be an integral part of Ukraine,"" he said. It was a sentiment echoed by several world leaders, who called the scheduled vote and possible pullout violations of Ukrainian and international law. ""Any discussion about the future of Ukraine must include the legitimate government of Ukraine,"" said U.S. President Barack Obama. ""In 2014, we are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of democratic leaders."" It's not clear how easily the region could split off from Ukraine even if the referendum endorses the move. The developments came at a dizzying pace Thursday as Yatsenyuk joined emergency talks in Brussels, Belgium, called by leaders of the European Union who support the Kiev government and want to de-escalate the crisis. The EU and the United States announced plans to freeze the assets of Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted as Ukraine's president after he turned his back on a trade deal with the EU in favor of one with Russia. The rejected trade deal prompted months of protests that culminated in February with bloody street clashes that left dozens dead and Yanukovych out of office. Interpol said it is reviewing a request by Ukrainian authorities that would allow for the arrest of Yanukovych on charges of abuse of power and murder, an allegation tied to the death of protesters. Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, putting the two countries on a collision course over control of the Crimea, a peninsula on the Black Sea that has long ties to Russia and has thousands of Russian troops stationed there. Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted he has the right to use military force in Ukraine if necessary to protect ethnic Russians under threat in Crimea. Ukrainian officials say no such threat exists and say Putin is using it as a pretext to control the region. As the standoff continued, Ukrainian authorities announced the arrest Thursday of a leader of a pro-Russian movement in the eastern city of Donetsk. Authorities said he is a Ukrainian national named Pavlo Gubarev, a self-proclaimed governor of Donetsk. In Crimea, worlds collide . Growing divide . The crisis threatens to not only divide Ukraine, but Russia and the West. Those two sides have exchanged barbs and threatened punitive measures against each other in recent days, all while offering divergent views on the situation in Crimea. Two diplomats at the center of the crisis --  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov -- met face-to-face on Thursday. They agreed to continue talking ""over the course of the next hours, the next days'' to try to find a political solution to end the crisis, Kerry told reporters following the meeting. The diplomats' bosses, Obama and Putin, talked for an hour Thursday afternoon, with the U.S. president stating ""Russia's actions are in violation of Ukraine's sovereignty"" and that there is a diplomatic way out, according to the White House. Putin's office said the call -- initiated by Obama -- ""revealed differences in approaches and assessments of the causes of the crisis and the current situation."" He also voiced Russia's view it ""cannot ignore calls for help"" from eastern and southeastern Ukraine, before concluding that Lavrov and Kerry ""will continue intensive contacts."" Such conversations haven't stopped either side from taking action. EU nations, for instance, announced Thursday they will suspend bilateral talks with Russia on visa matters and have threatened travel bans, asset freezes and cancellation of the EU-Russia summit. ""Any further steps by the Russian Federation to destabilize the situation in Ukraine would lead to additional and far reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas,"" EU leaders said, having also threatened travels bans on certain Russians and the freezing of some assets. The United States has taken action. The State Department has imposed a visa ban on Russian and Ukrainian officials and others that it says are responsible for, or complicit in, threatening Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Obama signed an executive order laying the groundwork for sanctions against individuals and entities responsible for the crisis. Despite such pressure, Russia hasn't budged, even refusing to engage in direct talks with the new Ukrainian authorities in Kiev. As  his office noted after the Obama call, Putin believes this government ""is a result of an unconstitutional revolution"" and imposed ""illegitimate decisions."" The dispute has threatened to boil into a military conflict. Putin has denied claims by Ukrainian officials and Western diplomats that Russia has sent thousands of troops into the region in recent days. Moscow says the heavily armed troops, who are in uniforms without insignia and who have reportedly encircled Ukrainian bases, are local ""self-defense"" forces. Meanwhile, Russia has begun  an air defense drill 280 miles (450 kilometers) from Ukraine's border, reports Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti. A military spokesman called it ""the largest-ever exercise held by air defense units"" in the region. Russian authorities said the drills are part of a regular combat training cycle, according to the news agency. But the move comes a day after the U.S. military announced it was beefing up the number of fighter jets in the Baltics, adding six F-15s to the four participating in a NATO mission in the region. Five possible ways to end the crisis . Voting for Russia or Ukraine? Amid all the diplomatic wrangling, it is Ukrainians who are most directly affected. And they hardly are speaking with one voice. Furor in the western part of the country over Yanukovych, his powers and his bringing Ukraine closer to Russia led to his ouster. Now, most people here support the new government and oppose Russian intervention, as well as the prospect of Crimea becoming part of Russia. The sentiment tends to be very different in Crimea -- which was part of Russia until being given to Ukraine in 1954 by Soviet leader Nikita Kruschev -- and other parts of southern and eastern Ukraine. Late last month, the parliament in Crimea installed a new, pro-Moscow government late last month -- as armed, pro-Russian men besieged the parliament building -- and does not recognize the authorities in Kiev. Citizens will be allowed to vote on March 16 on whether they want an autonomous republic of Crimea within Russia; or within Ukraine. The autonomous region has a 60% ethnic Russian population, having been part of Russia until it was ceded to Ukraine in 1954 by the Soviet Union. But not everyone may be as keen on coming under Moscow's direct influence. About 25% of the peninsula's population is Ukrainian and about 12% is Crimean Tatar, a predominantly Muslim group. As riot police looked on, hundreds gathered Thursday in the southern port city of Odessa under the flag of the former Soviet Union calling for unity with Russia. ""We are all standing here for Russia,"" one masked protester told CNN's Matthew Chance. ""None of us wants to be part of the European Union."" Late Thursday, the management of the hotel in the Crimean capital of Simferopol where CNN has been based told the network to stop broadcasting from there. Other media outlets got the same message, and no reason was given. Not everyone in this region wants to become part of Russia. Protesters, including one topless woman who was dragged away screaming, railed against the Crimean parliament vote and Putin. But they were drowned out by a heckling, pro-Russian crowd. Alex Shiroki, from Yalta, said that his boss asked him, point-blank, ""Are you for Ukraine or for Russia?"" While his boss favors the latter, Shiroki does not, saying he'd probably leave if Crimea ends up splitting from Ukraine. U.S. paves way for sanctions on Russians, Ukrainians over Crimea . Michael Crawford, a former British ambassador in Eastern Europe, said that may not happen -- at least easily or peacefully -- even if voters support such a split in the upcoming referendum. ""For Russia to start cherry-picking bits of the former Soviet Union, cranking up referenda in Kazakhstan or Latvia or wherever you like, to try to carve off bits, would be against international law,"" Crawford said, ""And it would be something Vladimir Putin has said he doesn't want to do."" Yatsenyuk said that if Ukraine is broken up, the world will have trouble ever getting another country to give up its nuclear weapons program. Why? In 1994, Ukraine agreed to give up its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal in return for guarantees -- signed by the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia -- of its territorial integrity and independence. What happens now to Ukraine ""will have an impact on nuclear nonproliferation programs,"" Yatsenyuk said. Live updates of the crisis in Ukraine .

"The battle in Washington over the budget is not mere partisan squabbling. What we are debating is the perennial argument between right and left: Do we as a society prefer to leave the well-being of our people to the indifference of the market economy, or do we believe that government also has an important role to play? We are accustomed to thinking of the argument between left and right as an ideological or philosophical debate, so it has no ""correct"" answer. But there is an answer: We are entirely capable of knowing what policies best contribute to people leading positive and rewarding lives. In recent decades, social scientists have been studying human happiness in the same way we study any other human attribute. Vast new multidisciplinary research has emerged around the proposition that it is possible to empirically measure the extent to which people view their lives as satisfying. Can it be stopped? 8 answers on Obamacare and the shutdown . So what conditions best promote more rewarding lives? The answer is simple and unequivocal: Happier people live in countries with a generous social safety net, or, more generally, countries whose governments  ""tax and spend"" at higher rates, reflecting the greater range of services and protections offered by the state. (These findings come from analysis of data from the World Values Surveys for the 21 Western industrial democracies from 1981 to 2007 for my book ""The Political Economy of Human Happiness."" Similar findings have been reported in peer-reviewed journals like ""Social Research"" and the ""Social Indicators Research."") The relationship could not be stronger or clearer: However much it may pain conservatives to hear it, the ""nanny state,"" as they disparagingly call it, works. Across the Western world, the quality of human life increases as the size of the state increases. It turns out that having a ""nanny"" makes life better for people.  This is borne out by the U.N. 2013 ""World Happiness Report,"" which found Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden the top five happiest nations. Conservatives may be equally troubled to learn that labor unions have a similar effect. Not only are workers who belong to unions happier, but the overall rate of happiness for everyone -- members and nonmembers -- increases dramatically as the percentage of workers who belong to unions grows, reflecting the louder political voice that organization gives to ordinary citizens. All this remains true when controlling for the many other things that might also affect quality of life, such as  income, age, gender, marital status, or their country's culture, history, or level of economic development. Critically, ""big government"" and labor unions also promote happiness not merely for those toward the bottom or middle of the income distribution, but for everyone, rich and poor, men and women, conservatives and liberals. The same pattern emerges when looking at our states. People who live in states with higher welfare spending, more organized labor, more liberal state governments, more regulation of business, and a greater recent history of control by the Democratic Party, are all more satisfied with their lives, regardless of income, and again when controlling for other factors that are likely to affect well-being. Zelizer: GOP strategy on shutdown courts doom . The reasons the progressive agenda promotes happiness are complex, but stated simply, the more we supplement the cold efficiency of the market with interventions that reduce poverty, insecurity, and inequality, the more we improve quality of life for everyone. As poet and novelist Wendell Berry observed, ""Rats and roaches live by competition under the laws of supply and demand; it is the privilege of human beings to live under the laws of justice and mercy."" It takes no great insight to see that a world with less insecurity and less poverty, which is to say, a world more governed by justice and mercy, is one that people of all social classes will find more satisfying. Many benefit directly from social programs or the representation of their interests by unions; others worry less than they otherwise might because they know these institutions exist when needed; and everyone benefits indirectly by living in a society which is relatively free of social pathologies, such as the higher rates of violent crime, that come with the poverty, inequality and insecurity that liberal policies help ameliorate. The data demonstrate that this is not merely softhearted wishful thinking. Whatever else unions and liberal public policies might do, they help make the world a better place to the extent that we believe  human happiness is the appropriate metric to  measure such judgments. That in turn suggests the most intellectually compelling strategy available to progressives in the battle for public opinion: Traditional New Deal policies are precisely those that best allow citizens to pursue the happiness that the founders of our republic so famously argued to be the final justification for the American experiment.","Benjamin Radcliff: Well-being should not be decided by the indifferent marketplace .

"(CNN) -- A Swedish SWAT team backed by local police arrested four people overnight on suspicion of plotting terror attacks, the Swedish Security Service told CNN Sunday. The four were held in the city of Gothenburg for ""probable cause"" of preparing the attacks, the highest level of suspicion in Sweden, said Sara Kvarnstrom, a spokeswoman for the security force. She refused to say whether the suspects had been under surveillance or if the arrests resulted from a tip-off, saying she could not discussed details on an ongoing investigation. ""Through these arrests we have been able to prevent a situation from occurring,"" Malena Rembe, head analyst at the Swedish Security Service, told CNN affiliate TV4. Sweden is not raising its terror threat level -- which is currently at 3, with 5 as the highest -- and there is ""no reason for the public to be alarmed,"" she said. ""These arrests have not changed this threat level,"" Kvarnstrom added. An art gallery in central Gothenburg was evacuated shortly before midnight local time, police said, but declined to say whether it was connected to the arrests. A party was going on at the Roda Sten gallery at the time, with about 500 people attending the inauguration of an arts festival, according an interview with a witness in Goteborgs Posten, a local newspaper. The police cordon was removed at 6 a.m. local time, said Ulf Edberg, a spokesman for Gothenburg police. Police have a ""number of extra police officers"" on the streets of Gothenburg, Edberg said. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Hilding Qvarnstrom, said in a statement on the prosecution authority's website that the investigation is still at an early stage and authorities cannot reveal any details about the arrests. The head of the Swedish Security Service, Anders Danielsson, warned last week that ""Islamic terrorism is still the biggest threat against Sweden."" ""But it is different today,"" he said, calling it ""more complex and unpredictable, both in terms of who could be a target and how they can strike."" Al Qaeda is now encouraging Muslim radicals to stay home ""and strike where they are,"" rather than traveling to conflict zones to get experience, said Rembe of the Swedish Security Service. ""When individuals with those kind of ideologies act on their own it becomes harder to make a threat assessment,"" she warned. Stockholm was hit by a suicide bombing in December. The attack on the capital, Sweden's first suicide bombing, wounded two people in a district full of Christmas shoppers. And police arrested two people in Gothenburg, the country's second-largest city, on suspicion of plotting a bombing in October. They were later released without charge, police said. After the Stockholm bombing, Swedish Security Police said the country had almost 200 Islamic extremists who advocate violence, but said there was no indication their number is growing. The police study was commissioned months before the attack in Stockholm. The extremist threat isn't widespread, according to the report, which the government commissioned in February 2010. ""The threat from violence-promoting Islamic extremism in Sweden is currently not a threat to the fundamental structures of society, Sweden's democratic system or central government,"" the summary said. But the radicals are capable of damage, police said. ""While violence-promoting Islamist extremist groups do not pose a threat to Swedish society, they are still a threat to individuals and groups, especially in other countries,"" the report said. The police analysis highlighted the disturbing trend of increasing foreign travel by the radicals. ""The most serious potential threat to Sweden is the long-term effects of people from Sweden choosing to travel abroad to join violence-promoting Islamic extremist groups,"" the police said. ""There are currently no signs of falling interest in joining foreign groups."" Swedish authorities are investigating involvement in radicalism by Taimour Abdulwahab, the weekend's suicide bomber. His emails before the bombings said that one reason for the attack was Sweden's tolerance of Lars Vilks' newspaper cartoon of the prophet Mohammed as a dog, authorities said. Abdulwahab, 28 -- who had lived in Iraq, Sweden and the English town of Luton -- also cited the presence of Swedish troops in Afghanistan. That cartoon of Mohammed, published in 2007, was also cited in the new report as an example ""of local events that may fuel radicalism globally."" Sweden's radical networks are typically made up of males between 15 and 30 years of age, with varying backgrounds, most of whom were born or grew up in Sweden, the report said. Several women are also involved, sharing the violence-promoting ideology, but they don't engage directly in security-threatening activities, the police said. At least 80% of the radicals are socially connected, mainly through friendships and the Internet, but the social ties don't make them ""one coherent network capable of fully coordinating its resources and working towards the same goal,"" the report said. Swedish terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp said that before the December bombing, Sweden thought it was ""immune"" to terror attacks. ""Even (Osama) bin Laden said in early 2003, 2004, that if every country was like Sweden, there would be no terrorism,"" Ranstorp said. Police called upon civic leaders as well as the Swedish Muslim community to prevent and counter extremism, and they encouraged the public to develop a deeper knowledge of Islam. Though they shouldn't feel a greater responsibility to do so, practicing Muslims and their clerics could be helpful in countering ""violence-promoting propagandists active in Sweden and abroad,"" the report said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We have been able to prevent a situation,"" a top security analyst says .

"Republican Ted Cruz of Texas took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to discuss the shutdown debate in remarks that headed deep into the night -- a dramatic step in defense of his high profile and controversial plan to prevent any funding for Obamacare. ""I intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand,"" he said.  ""All across this country, Americans are suffering because of Obamacare. Obamacare isn't working."" Cruz, who began speaking shortly after 2:40 p.m. ET, was alone for nearly an hour before being joined by Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican. The tea party allies engaged in an extended dialogue that was part stamina test for Cruz and part political theater for the rest of Capitol Hill. Cruz was later briefly joined by other Republican senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky, another tea party favorite, David Vitter of Louisiana, and Sen. Marco Rubio spoke as well. ""How many more Americans will have to see their wages or their hours cut as a result of this ill-conceived law before we do something about this?"" Vitter asked. As Cruz got going, he raised a number of points about the issue at hand. ""This fight is not about any member of this body. This fight is not about personalities.  Look, most Americans could not give a flying flip about a bunch of politicians in Washington.  Who cares?  Almost all of us are in cheap suits with bad haircuts!  Who cares?"" he said. He also read from the Dr. Seuss children's classic ""Green Eggs and Ham"" to his daughters as the night wore on. There was also a sharp exchange with Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who was was the first Democrat to question Cruz during his remarks. Cruz's comments were not -- in and of themselves -- a filibuster, a practice made famous by Jimmy Stewart in the 1939 movie ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" when Senate business was brought to a halt through one lengthy, uninterrupted speech. They were, however, part of an ongoing attempted filibuster by some Senate conservatives. Cruz and a few others in the Republican caucus are trying to prevent the Senate from taking up the government funding bill passed last week by the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. Cruz and his tea party allies support the House bill, which removes funding for the implementation of President Barack Obama's health care law, but don't want to give Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Senate Democrats a chance to amend the measure by restoring Obamacare funding. Reid had filed a motion to break the filibuster before Cruz rose to speak.  The clock was already ticking on the Senate's first key procedural vote on the matter, which will take place shortly after 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday regardless of what Cruz does. Reid needs 60 votes in order to break the attempted filibuster and formally kick off debate on the House bill.  There are 54 members of the Democratic caucus, which means the support of at least six Republicans will be required. Once the formal debate has started, however, Reid will only need 50 votes to make changes to the House measure. ""Any senator who votes (to move forward with debate on the House bill) is voting to give Harry Reid the authority to fund Obamacare,"" Cruz told CNN's Dana Bash on Monday, firing a warning shot at his fellow Senate Republicans. GOP infighting over how best to prevent a government shutdown while defunding Obamacare escalated further on Tuesday, as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, publicly dismissed Cruz's more confrontational strategy. ""I don't think that filibustering a bill that defunds Obamacare is the best route to defunding Obamacare,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor.  ""All it does is shut down the government and keep Obamacare funded, and none of us want that."" Cruz's GOP critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama himself remains in the White House. They believe that trying to do so by forcing a shutdown -- or preventing a hike in the debt ceiling next month -- will backfire by harming the economy and damaging the Republican brand. Some Republicans, like McConnell, would at least like the opportunity to force vulnerable Democrats to cast a politically tough vote on the House plan. Republicans have ""a rare opportunity to defund this law with a simple majority,"" McConnell added.  ""We should have that vote."" It remains to be seen how much pressure Cruz and his tea party backers will ultimately put on other Republicans. McConnell is up for reelection in 2014, and his conservative GOP primary challenger wasted no time Tuesday blasting the minority leader for opposing Cruz's stance. ""Like so many other crucial fights, Mitch McConnell has caved to Harry Reid on Obamacare and is refusing to fight to defund this disastrous legislation,"" Matt Bevin said. ""I am proud to support conservatives like Senator Ted Cruz in his fight to defund Obamacare, and I promise the people of Kentucky: I will never cave to Harry Reid."" For his part, Reid argued on the Senate floor that ""just as the economy begins to gain steam, some Republicans in Congress seem determined to derail four years of progress."" ""They're obsessed with defunding health care,"" he said.  ""They're pushing us closer and closer to a government shutdown that would tank the economy.""","Cruz in marathon protest speech on Senate floor .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama has missed the most votes of any Democratic presidential hopeful in the Senate over the last two months, including a vote on an Iran resolution he has blasted Sen. Hillary Clinton for supporting. Sen. Barack Obama makes a campaign stop at Iowa State University on Saturday. The Illinois Democrat has missed nearly 80 percent of all votes since September. The other Democrats in the Senate running for president have missed a high percentage of votes as well. Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware has missed 68 percent of the votes during the same period, Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut 65 percent and Clinton of New York 63 percent. Obama's campaign points out that Biden missed the most votes if the whole year is considered, followed by Dodd, then Obama. Obama's campaign argues that looking at the last two months is arbitrary. Obama missed a vote on a resolution that declared the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, an elite part of the Iranian military, a terrorist organization. He has criticized Clinton for voting for it, saying it would give President Bush a ""blank check"" to invade Iran. ""This kind of resolution does not send the right signal to the region,"" Obama said during a presidential debate earlier this week. ""It doesn't send the right signal to our allies or our enemies."" Watch the report on Obama's voting in the Senate » . Obama was campaigning in New Hampshire when the vote was taken. His campaign blamed his absence on the short notice given when the vote was scheduled. But two senior Democratic Senate aides said senators were advised the night before that the vote would occur the next day. A spokesman for Obama, however, was adamant Obama did not have enough time to return to Washington for the vote. Obama has also missed votes on a Democratic priority, the expansion of the federally funded State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) as well as a vote on a resolution that condemned MoveOn.org for running an ad in the New York Times attacking the top general in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus. Most of the votes Obama missed were for amendments to spending bills, when his vote would not have decided the outcome. Obama's campaign says he was in the Senate for critical votes, and canceled a campaign appearance to be in the Senate for a critical SCHIP vote. ""The most important votes that this Congress did were in the first six months -- ethics reform, minimum wage, Iraq, 9/11 bill, energy,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said. ""The last two months have been appropriations bills, and we were here for the Iraq votes."" Stu Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report said the voters may not punish Obama for missing votes. ""I think most Americans understand that if you're running for president, you're going to have to be in Iowa, New Hampshire, and you're not going to make all the votes and they give candidates slack,"" Rothenberg said. With the mounting fight with the White House over key bills, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is putting all the contenders on notice. ""I am going to leave here and go call our presidentials and let them know that they better look at their schedules, because these are not votes you can miss,"" Reid said on the Senate floor Friday.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A giant lobster named George escaped a dinner-table fate and was released Saturday into the Atlantic Ocean after a New York seafood restaurant granted him his freedom, according to a statement from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. George the lobster was a ""sort of mascot"" for City Crab and Seafood in New York. The lobster, which PETA said was 140 years old and weighed 20 pounds, had been confined to a tank at City Crab and Seafood restaurant in Manhattan when two customers alerted the animal group. The PETA statement did not say how the extraordinary age estimate was determined, but restaurant manager Keith Valenti told CNN that lobsters can grow a pound every seven to 10 years, and he put George's weight at 18 to 20 pounds. ""I've been here for 12 years, and that's the biggest lobster I've ever seen,"" Valenti said. He said the lobster had been ""sitting in the restaurant's tank and acting as a sort of mascot,"" but when PETA got involved and requested the release, it ""seemed like the right thing to do."" PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said in a statement, ""We applaud the folks at City Crab and Seafood for their compassionate decision to allow this noble old-timer to live out his days in freedom and peace. ""We hope that their kind gesture serves as an example that these intriguing animals don't deserve to be confined to tiny tanks or boiled alive."" Shedding the tight confines of his old restaurant display tank, George was driven to Maine by PETA members and was returned to his natural habitat on the ocean floor Saturday, the organization said.","PETA estimated lobster's age at 140 years; he weighed 20 pounds .

"Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson learned Tuesday he will be suspended without pay for the rest of the 2014 NFL season, according to an NFL statement. Peterson intends to appeal. Peterson will not be reinstated before April 15 because he violated the league's personal conduct policy ""in an incident of abusive discipline that he inflicted on his four-year-old son last May,"" the league said. Peterson has been on the exempt/commissioner's permission list -- which kept him off the field, with pay -- since September after allegations he disciplined his son too harshly with a ""switch"" or thin stick. Initially charged with felony child abuse, Peterson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault this month. ""The timing of your potential reinstatement will be based on the results of the counseling and treatment program set forth in this decision,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Peterson. ""Under this two-step approach, the precise length of the suspension will depend on your actions. We are prepared to put in place a program that can help you to succeed, but no program can succeed without your genuine and continuing engagement."" His reinstatement also hinges on his rehabilitation, how he cares for his children and whether he commits further violations of the law or league policy, the letter stated. ""We respect the league's decision and will have no further comment at this time,"" the Vikings said in a statement. NFLPA claims 'credibility gap' Peterson will appeal the decision, the NFL Players Association said in a statement. The NFLPA further said the discipline imposed on Peterson is ""inconsistent"" and it will ""demand that a neutral arbitrator oversee the appeal."" The NFL's decision demonstrates that a ""credibility gap ... exists between the agreements they make and the actions they take,"" the NFLPA said. Since Peterson's case was adjudicated, the league has ignored its obligations and tried to impose an arbitrary form of discipline on the running back, the NFLPA said. ""The facts are that Adrian has asked for a meeting with Roger Goodell, the discipline imposed is inconsistent and an NFL executive told Adrian that his time on the Commissioner's list would be considered as time served,"" the statement said. Peterson has not played since September 7, when the Vikings took on the St. Louis Rams in the first game of the season. As of Sunday, when the Vikings lost to the Chicago Bears, Peterson has missed nine games. A hearing will now be scheduled and Peterson -- with the counsel of a lawyer and the NFL Players Association -- can present evidence in support of his appeal. He will remain on the commissioner's exempt list until the appeal has run its course. Aggravating circumstances . According to the NFL, Goodell has established a ""baseline discipline"" of six games without pay for first-offense assault, battery or domestic violence, but he cited aggravating circumstances in Peterson's case: . -- The child was only 4, and while an adult can flee, fight back or call the police when experiencing abuse, those options aren't available to a child; . -- The child suffered psychological trauma stemming from the ""criminal physical abuse at the hands of his father""; . -- ""The repetitive use of a switch"" is tantamount to a weapon in the hands of someone with the strength of a pro athlete; . -- Peterson showed ""no meaningful remorse"" and publicly said he would not ""eliminate whooping my kids."" He also sent text messages to the child's mother defending his actions, which raises concerns that he doesn't understand the seriousness of his conduct and may do it again in the future. Though Peterson dodged jail time with his no-contest plea, he received probation, community service and a $4,000 fine, but the league said it would still review the case under its personal conduct policy. Case reviewed; Peterson absent . The NFL met to review his case Friday, but Peterson did not attend, saying in a statement that he ""wouldn't participate in a newly created and non-collectively bargained pre-discipline 'hearing' that would include outside people I don't know and who would have roles in the process that the NFL wouldn't disclose."" He did, however, attend via teleconference a Monday hearing aimed at determining if he could be taken off the commissioner's exempt list. The Monday hearing was in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, Peterson said. The NFL says it requested that Peterson provide information so it could evaluate the case under its personal conduct policy, but the player provided only ""some of the court papers relating to his November 4 plea agreement."" The league requested the information again from the NFLPA on November 11, but Peterson submitted only ""the name of a professional with whom Peterson has consulted during the past two months,"" the league said. ""Your plea agreement in Texas, and the related violation of the Personal Conduct Policy, arise out of abusive injuries that you inflicted on your son earlier this year,"" Goodell said in his letter to Peterson. ""Based on public reports of your statements and photographs that were made public at the time of the indictment, you used a 'switch' -- a flexible tree branch -- to punish your son, striking him in the ankles, limbs, back, buttocks, and genitals, leaving visible swelling, marks, and cuts on his body and risking severe and long-term damage. The visible injuries were such that a local pediatrician in Minnesota, upon examining your son, felt obligated to make a child abuse report to the police."" Lesson not learned? Not only did a grand jury indict Peterson on a felony charge because he ""overstepped the bounds of acceptable corporal punishment,"" Goodell wrote, but it also ""appears that this is not the first time that you have punished children in this way. Public statements attributed to you indicate that you believe that this kind of discipline is appropriate and that you do not intend to stop disciplining your children this way."" In explaining his client's behavior ahead of court proceedings, defense attorney Rusty Hardin told media outlets that his client used a switch to dole out discipline much like Peterson himself ""experienced as a child growing up in East Texas."" Goodell has directed Peterson to meet with April Kuchuk, an instructor in the New York University department of psychiatry and a forensic consultant to the New York City District Attorney's offices and New York courts, by December 1, the NFL said. Kuchuk will develop a counseling and therapy program for Peterson, according to the league statement. ""Dr. Kuchuk states that two evidence-based forms of therapy have been shown to contribute to reducing the risk of future abusive behavior in child abuse cases: first, therapy that addresses parenting your children, in particular those who do not live with you, using a modality called parent-child interactive therapy; and second, cognitive-behavioral therapy that teaches the effects of abusive behavior on children and how it traumatizes them,"" the statement said. Suspension could be longer? Goodell told Peterson he will establish periodic reviews, beginning April 15, to make sure he is meeting the program requirements and is committed to making sure nothing like this happens again. If Peterson doesn't cooperate or follow the plan, the suspension may be extended, Goodell warned. It's also imperative that he follow the conditions of his plea agreement and avoid any other violations of the law or the league's personal conduct policy, the commissioner said. ""The well-being of your children is of paramount concern,"" Goodell wrote. ""In the absence of speaking to you to understand your current disposition toward child discipline, we cannot be sure that this conduct will not be repeated. Moreover, we are unaware of any effort on your part to acknowledge the seriousness of your conduct and your responsibility to demonstrate a genuine commitment to change.""","Commissioner says Adrian Peterson's son suffered ""criminal physical abuse""

"Another member of state-funded Russia Today made waves on Wednesday -- not by standing behind Moscow, as the news network is wont to do, but by bucking it. From the anchor chair, Liz Wahl closed a show -- as seen in video which she later tweeted -- talking about the ""ethical and moral challenges"" she faces working for Russia Today, also known as RT. She spoke of being from a family who fled to America to escape Soviet forces during the 1956 Hungarian revolution, being the daughter of a U.S. military veteran and being the partner of a physician who works at a U.S. military base. ""And that is why, personally, I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin,"" Wahl said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""I'm proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth,"" she added. ""And that is why, after this newscast, I'm resigning."" Not that she would've necessarily lasted much longer, after her comments. In a statement, RT said, ""When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional."" ""But when someone makes a big public show of a personal decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt,"" said the network. Talking Wednesday night to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Wahl said the idea she did this ""for personal gain ... couldn't be farther from the truth."" She said she'd ""hesitated to speak on this for a while for fear of repercussion,"" but decided to act now based on her belief ""the propagandist nature of RT (had come) out in full force"" over its coverage of the Ukraine crisis. ""RT is not about the truth; it's about promoting a Putinist agenda,"" Wahl told CNN. ""And I can tell you firsthand, it's about bashing America."" Wahl, who characterizes herself as a Filipina-Hungarian-American and RT America correspondent on her Twitter feed, became the second personality from Russia Today to defiantly, publicly challenge the government that effectively signs their paychecks. Her resignation announcement didn't explicitly mention the crisis in Ukraine, though she mentioned it later in her CNN interview. Backed by Western diplomats, officials in that Eastern European nation claim that Russian troops have violated their sovereignty by effectively invading the Crimean peninsula. Putin, meanwhile, has denied sending any more of his country's troops into the country, or that any of the up to 25,000 troops who are stationed there have played any part in the standoff, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. But that situation is central to RT's coverage, which leans toward Moscow's point of view. On Wednesday, for instance, its website featured stories with headlines such as ""Kiev snipers hired by Maidan leaders,"" ""'Cold War stereotypes': Russia condemns NATO plan"" and ""Questions on Ukraine the West chooses not to answer."" Two days ago, another RT personality -- Abby Martin -- referred directly to ""Russia's military occupation of Crimea"" while seemingly going off this pro-Russia script at the end of her ""Breaking the Set"" program. News anchor: 'What Russia did is wrong' ""I can't stress enough how strongly I am against any state intervention in a sovereign nation's affairs,"" said Martin, a California native who, like Wahl, is based in Washington. ""What Russia did is wrong."" While Martin refused to ""defend military aggression,"" she didn't leave RT. In fact, she returned to the air the following night and wasn't even reprimanded, according to the network. As RT noted in a statement, Martin called it ""kind of a sad commentary that"" -- while she's regularly spoken out against military intervention -- ""my only criticism of Russia's actions was picked up"" by the media. On Wednesday night, Wahl said she'd recently become upset over portions of one of her interviews being cut, what she called a ""very dangerous"" segment on neo-Nazi elements among the Ukrainian opposition and ""very, very loaded"" questions being planted by RT's management. ""I felt that I could no longer work here and go on television and tell the American people that this is what's happening and have it pose as news,"" Wahl said. ""It's something that I don't feel comfortable with."" Leaked call raises questions about who was behind sniper attacks in Ukraine . Both Wahl and Martin's remarks shined a spotlight on what exactly RT is -- in terms of its purpose and its viewpoint, especially for its U.S.-based, English-language programming. The Russian foreign ministry's website points to the network as a top media source. And the Columbia Journalism Review says it is best ""known as an extension of former President Vladimir Putin's confrontational foreign policy."" In its statement on Martin, the network said that ""RT journalists and hosts are free to express their own opinions."" What makes Martin's comments different from those of Wahl, according to RT, is that the former ""spoke in the context of her own talk show, to the viewers who have been tuning in for years to hear her opinions on current events, the opinions that most media did not care about until two days ago."" ""For years, Ms. Martin, has been speaking out against U.S. military intervention only to be ignored by the mainstream news outlets,"" RT added. ""But with that one comment, branded as an act of defiance, she became an overnight sensation."" The network then seemed to suggest that Wahl -- who cheered Martin as ""my girl"" after her commentary -- paid attention to all the hoopla. ""It is a tempting example to follow,"" RT said. Wahl said many who do follow the lead of network management -- the senior members of which are in Moscow -- are young, ""inexperienced"" and ""eager to please"" their bosses. ""Eventually, you learn what management likes, what management dislikes,"" she said. ""... They kind of make sure the narrative is delivered in one way or another.""

"Just over two weeks after the fatal shooting, and less than a month before an arrest was made, police in Sanford, Florida, urged prosecutors to take George Zimmerman into custody after arguing his killing of Trayvon Martin was ""ultimately avoidable."" This disclosure came out Thursday, part of a wealth of information released that is related to the case, including the medical's examiner's finding that the 17-year-old Martin had traces of drugs in his system in an autopsy conducted hours after his death. Overall, the newly released material paints the most complete picture yet of how investigators built the case, as well as its complexity. The police perspective was most succinctly stated in a March 13 ""capias request"" -- a request that someone be taken into custody -- sent to the state's attorney. It speaks to the fact that Zimmerman ignored a police dispatcher's advice not to chase Martin, as well as his communications with Martin prior to the shooting. New documents shed light on Trayvon Martin killing . ""The encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement, or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog (sic) in an effort to dispel each party's concern"" the request said. ""There is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity."" In his 911 call just before the shooting, Zimmerman had speculated that the teen looked like he was ""up to no good or he's on drugs or something."" But Martin's defenders have portrayed Zimmerman as the aggressor, accusing him of profiling the African-American teen. Plus, one expert notes the traces of the marijuana-related substance found in the teen's system, as measured hours after his death, don't necessarily speak to any level of intoxication, while another adds that marijuana use typically doesn't make people prone to aggression. Martin's blood contained THC, which is the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, according to autopsy results released Thursday.  The autopsy was conducted February 27, the day after the teenager was shot dead. Toxicology tests found elements of the drug in the teenager's chest blood -- 1.5 nanograms per milliliter of one type (THC), as well as 7.3 nanograms of another type (THC-COOH) -- according to the medical examiner's report. There also was a presumed positive test of cannabinoids in Martin's urine, according to the medical examiner's report. It was not immediately clear how significant these amounts were. No precise levels on the urine were released. Dr. Michael Policastro, a toxicologist, cautioned against reading too much into the blood THC levels, adding that one cannot make a direct correlation between those findings and a level of intoxication. He also noted levels of THC, which can linger in a person's system for days, can spike after death in certain areas of the body because of redistribution. And Dr. Drew Pinsky, an addiction specialist who hosts a show on CNN's sister network HLN, added that marijuana typically does not make users more aggressive. Concentrations of THC routinely rise to 100 to 200 ng/ml after marijuana use, though it typically falls to below 5 ng/ml within three hours of it being smoked, according to information on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website. While some states have zero-tolerance policies for any drug traces for driving while impaired, others set certain benchmarks, the website of California's Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs notes. In Nevada, that equates to 2 ng/ml for THC and 5 ng/ml for THC-COOH, also known as marijuana metabolite. The cutoff level in Ohio is 2 ng/ml for THC and 50 ng/ml for THC-COOH. According to the medical examiner's report, which was one of several documents on the case released Thursday by the office of special prosecutor Angela Corey, Martin died from a gunshot wound to chest fired from ""intermediate range,"" within 36 inches. The autopsy report lists the manner of death as a homicide. What happened that night? Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder for killing Martin in the Sanford neighborhood where the African-American teen was staying. Martin's father, Tracy, had taken his son with him to Sanford, about four hours away from the boy's home and where the father's fiance lived, after the teen was suspended for 10 days from Michael M. Krop High School in Miami. According to records obtained by the Miami Herald, Martin had been suspended from school three times: once for writing graffiti on a door, another time for school truancy and the last time due to drug residue being found in his backpack. Speaking of her son's suspension to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Sybrina Fulton said, ""Whatever he had dealings with the school, it was not criminal, it was not violent, he's never been arrested."" Just before the shooting, Zimmerman called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in his neighborhood. In the call Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman apparently disregarded that advice. Much has been made about whether Zimmerman during that call used a racial epithet in referring to Martin. But an FBI analysis, released Thursday, determined that the word could not be definitively identified ""due to weak signal level and poor recording quality."" A screaming voice could be heard on other 911 calls placed by neighbors, with some speculating those screams came from Martin and others that they belonged to Zimmerman. The FBI did not make a final determination either way, citing several reasons including the fact they came during ""an extreme emotional state,"" there weren't enough words to make a good comparison and the sound quality was low and distant. FBI analysis -- Zimmerman's 911 call (pdf -- strong language) Zimmerman claimed, according a police report released earlier, that he'd been ""assaulted (by Martin) and his head was struck on the pavement."" According a report from the Sanford Fire Department, released Thursday,  Zimmerman had ""abrasions to his forehead,"" ""bleeding/tenderness to his nose,"" and a ""small laceration to the back of his head"" when emergency personnel arrived at the scene at 7:27 p.m., six minutes after they were first called. By that time, Martin had no apparent pulse, according to the fire and EMS report. Emergency personnel attempted mouth-to-mask resuscitation and chest compressions, to no avail. He was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m. Prosecutors have said Zimmerman, who is a white Hispanic, killed the unarmed teenager unjustly after profiling him. Zimmerman, who has pleaded not guilty, has said that he shot Martin in self-defense. The start of the trial hasn't been set. The case put a spotlight on race relations, spurring protests nationwide and drawing prominent civil rights leaders to central Florida denouncing the actions of Sanford police and calling for Zimmerman's arrest. Special prosecutor Angela Corey announced he'd been charged on April 11, weeks after Sanford police initially declined to do so. It also raised questions about gun laws, as well as the merits of the ""Stand Your Ground"" law in Florida, and similar laws in other states that allow people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of serious injury or death.","Martin would be alive if Zimmerman stayed in his vehicle, police said .

"Walter Williams, the Mississippi man who returned to life after being pronounced dead about two weeks ago, died Thursday. He was 78. ""They came and got him again around 4:15 a.m.,"" Williams' nephew, Eddie Hester, told CNN affiliate WAPT. ""I think he's gone this time."" CNN learned about the death from Holmes County, Mississippi, coroner Dexter Howard. He was the same man who first declared Williams dead on February 26. ""There was no pulse. He was lifeless,"" the coroner said then. He completed his paperwork, placed Williams in a body bag and transported him to a funeral home. There, something strange happened: The body bag moved. Coroner on Williams' revival two weeks ago: 'I was in shock' ""We got him into the embalming room, and we noticed his legs beginning to move, like kicking,"" Howard said last month. ""He also began to do a little breathing."" An ambulance was called. Paramedics arrived and hooked Williams up to monitors. Sure enough, he had a heartbeat, so they transported him to the Holmes County Hospital and Clinics. Williams was released a few days later. He died of natural causes, according to the coroner. ""Every case I do is a learning experience,"" said Howard. When asked what the Williams case taught him, he replied: ""That miracles can happen."" CNN affiliate WJTV reported the longtime farmer, who family members called ""Snowball,"" died at his home.

"Actress Patricia Modell, who was married to former Cleveland Browns/Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell, died Wednesday, the Ravens organization announced. She was 80. She is survived by her husband, their two sons, John and David, and six grandchildren, the Ravens said. Modell, also known as Patricia Breslin, appeared on television, film, and the New York stage during her 22-year acting career, the Ravens said. Her most widely known role was as nurse Meg Bentley in the daytime soap opera General Hospital in the late 1960s, and she also played Laura Brooks on the primetime TV drama ""Peyton Place."" Modell was also a regular on ""Twilight Zone,"" ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" ""Perry Mason,"" and ""Maverick."" At one point, the Ravens said, Modell had appeared in more television shows than any other woman in U.S. history. Her record was eventually broken by one of her closest friends, the late Lucille Ball. Modell retired from acting after the couple married in 1969 and became involved in philanthropy. In Cleveland, she did work for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Cerebral Palsy Association, and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. She and her husband started and funded the Hospice of the Western Reserve in Cleveland. Modell was a major contributor in Baltimore to the St. Vincent's Center and the Baltimore Museum of Art. The Modells contributed $3.5 million to the Lyric Opera House, which was recently renamed the Patricia and Arthur Modell Performing Arts Center at The Lyric. The Modells pledged $5 million to help start a public boarding school, The SEED School, for disadvantaged students. They were named the 2009 Outstanding Philanthropists of the Year for their work and donations by the Association of Fundraising Professionals in Maryland. Art Modell has been connected with the NFL since 1961, including 43 years of full ownership of the Browns and the Ravens. He moved the franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore in 1996, renaming it so a new Cleveland team could keep the historic Browns name. He sold the team in 2004 but remains a minority owner.","Modell was married to Art Modell, the former owner of an NFL franchise .

"Patrick Dati had reached his breaking point. With a metal pin in his arm and Vicodin coursing through his veins, he picked up the phone to call his psychiatrist. Dati had undergone surgery for a broken arm after his then-boyfriend allegedly threw him down the stairs when he tried to leave their home. Now he sat on the phone with his doctor, explaining why he couldn't carry on, as he tried to overdose on painkillers. The attempt to end his life, which landed him in a psychiatric ward for two days, resulted in part because he felt trapped in the abusive relationship and saw no way out. ""I couldn't let my boyfriend go because he wasn't allowing me to,"" Dati said. Dati is one of an estimated 3.4% of adults who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, referred to as LGBT, in the United States. He's also one of a quarter of gay men in America who report having encountered intimate partner violence. While Dati reached out to LGBT resources for help while he was ensnared in the abusive relationship, including the Center on Halsted Anti-Violence Project's 24-Hour crisis hot line in Chicago, many in his position find that help is hard to come by. Now, thanks to new LGBT-inclusive language in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, signed into law this month, domestic violence victims like Dati will have access to many of the same abuse and trauma services as victims of heterosexual partner violence. Ty Cobb, the senior legislative counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, said the new language explicitly includes the LGBT community in the largest Violence Against Women Act grant program, the STOP grant program. Previously, there was no grant money specifically allocated to providing domestic violence services and outreach for the LGBT population. ""This provides funding to care providers who collaborate with prosecution and law enforcement officials to address domestic violence,"" Cobb said. Originally passed in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims. President Obama signed the reauthorization into law in Washington on March 7, saying it was a ""day of the advocates, a day of the survivors."" The act's new language highlights the reality that LGBT people also experience intimate partner and sexual violence. After the announcement, the president of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Katie Ray-Jones, said in statement: ""This legislation that extends protections to all victims no matter their race, legal status or sexual orientation sends an important message that no victim should be excluded from receiving critical resources that will help them live a life free of abuse."" Human rights and domestic violence activists say LGBT people are an underserved population when it comes to victim services and outreach. According to a study by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, 45% of LGBT victims were turned away when they sought assistance from a domestic violence shelter. Nearly 55% of those who filed for protection orders were denied them. Lack of access to services is not exclusive to the LGBT community; heterosexual victims are also turned away from shelters, usually for lack of space or funding as opposed to intolerance. According to the Missouri Council Against Sexual and Domestic Violence Services, the state turned away 19,000 victims in 2011 from shelters because of inadequate space. Still, not all states have laws ensuring the availability of civil orders of protection to LGBT victims, which may further contribute to victims' isolation. ""When we don't include LGBT in the conversation, when we have conversations that assume this is violence that only happens to women as perpetrated by men, we aren't giving LGBT the language to talk about their own relationships,"" said Sharon Stapel, the executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project. ""By omission, we're saying 'you don't matter -- you're not a part of this.'"" The Violence Against Women Act  language comes at a pivotal time, as incidences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender violence have come under more scrutiny. A 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey found that the prevalence of intimate partner violence was higher in some LGBT relationships than in their heterosexual counterparts: 61% of bisexual women and 44% of lesbian women reported intimate partner violence versus 35% of heterosexual women.  Meanwhile, 26% of gay men and 37% of bisexual men reported being assaulted or stalked by a partner, compared with 29% of heterosexual men. The special report of the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey was the first of its kind to present comparisons between groups by sexual orientation. According to Stapel, the Violence Against Women Act  reauthorization breaks down the barriers that LGBT people face when they recognize their relationship is unhealthy and violent -- and decide to reach out for support. ""Some of those barriers are very unintentional. They are service providers who are used to dealing with violence against women and have these very gendered ways of talking about the problem,"" Stapel said. For instance, if a woman calls a domestic violence hot line, most hot lines will immediately divert to language specific to boyfriends or husbands. Stapel said there's no intent to discriminate or be insensitive, it's just an easy assumption because the majority of callers are females with male abusive partners. (According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, 97% of its callers are female.) At the same time, the assumption can be alienating. ""The first question makes them think, 'Oh, can I say that I'm a lesbian?' Or if a man calls, he is treated suspiciously because the presumption is that he's an abusive partner calling around looking for his wife or girlfriend,"" Stapel said. ""The first response that men may have is 'Oh no, this might not be a friendly place for me to go.'"" Because of the new LGBT provisions, the law has been decried by anti-same-sex-marriage groups, including the United States Conference for Catholic Bishops. ""All persons must be protected from violence, but codifying the classifications 'sexual orientation' and 'gender identity' as contained in S. 47 is problematic,"" the bishops said. ""These two classifications are unnecessary to establish the just protections due to all persons. They undermine the meaning and importance of sexual difference. They are unjustly exploited for purposes of marriage redefinition, and marriage is the only institution that unites a man and a woman with each other and with any children born from their union."" The Human Rights Campaign sees the reauthorization as a landmark achievement. ""One of the most amazing consequences is that not only did the Democratic-led Senate, but the House led by Republicans passed language that prevents discrimination,"" Cobb said. The House passed the Senate's version of VAWA after the House GOP's version of the bill, which did not include protection for LGBT people, was defeated. For domestic violence survivors like Dati, it's a welcome starting point in acknowledging and understanding the particular challenges of LGBT intimate partner violence. ""The gay community, my friends, supported me because LGBT domestic violence is very common -- at least in Chicago,"" Dati said. ""The people that saw what I was going through were there when I needed them, but it took me going through the abuse first."" When a friend won't walk away from abuse . Dati ultimately filed a restraining order when his ex-boyfriend began stalking him at his mother's house while he recovered from his suicide attempt and other injuries. While domestic violence in heterosexual relationships certainly isn't limited to physical abuse, Stapel said emotional abuse is a particularly powerful tactic in LGBT relationships. ""For example, threatening to out your partner to their boss when you live in a state with no employment nondiscrimination protection for being gay, that's a really powerful threat, no matter what size you are in proportion to your partner,"" Stapel said. Stapel finds the isolation and rejection many LGBT people feel from their families and friends who may not have accepted their lifestyle can also play a major role in how they view their relationships with their partners. As a way to control their partner, abusers might say things like: If you leave me, who else is going to love you? Who else is going to be there for you? ""It can really put someone who is already feeling insecure about their connections to people in a space where they feel really dependent on their abusive partner,"" said Stapel. Dati, who turns 50 this month, said his experiences led him to become a public advocate against abuse and sexual violence to show that it does, indeed, get better. He has written a book about being a survivor titled ""I Am Me."" ""I don't want to see another person live the way I did,"" Dati said. ""I went to hell and back and what I tell people now is, I'll never live with that kind of abuse again.""","Members of the LGBT community suffer domestic violence at higher rates than straights .
Many of those hurt struggle to find support resources to leave bad relationships .
Reauthorized Violence Against Women Act includes LGBT Americans .
Anti-same-sex-marriage groups see the move as a blow, while advocates think it's a boon ."
"(CNN) -- The 16-year-old son of actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston died Friday morning after suffering a seizure while vacationing with his family in the Bahamas, Travolta's attorney told CNN. Jett Travolta, right, joined his father weeks ago in Paris, where John Travolta has been filming a movie. ""At this point, we know that John Travolta and Kelly Preston's only son, Jett, had a seizure at around 10 a.m. this morning,"" attorney Michael Ossi said. ""All attempts to revive him were unsuccessful."" The boy hit his head after the seizure, but the exact cause of death is not known, Ossi said. An autopsy will be conducted Monday. His body will be transferred to Ocala, Florida, for burial, he said. Jett's death ""was completely out of the blue,"" he said. ""John and Kelly are happy when their children are happy. This is the worst day of John's life.""  Watch John Travolta and son Jett in Paris » . The Travoltas also have a daughter, Ella, 8. Bahamian police said a caretaker at the West End resort where the Travoltas were vacationing found the teenager unconscious in the bathroom. Jett Travolta was taken by ambulance to Rand Memorial Hospital in Freeport and was pronounced dead on arrival, police said. iReport.com: Can you relate to the loss of a child? Share your story . Jett's death was mourned by the staff and residents of West End, where the Travoltas were beloved members of the community, Obie Wilchcomb, former minister of tourism for the Bahamas, told CNN's Larry King. ""We in West End had admired Mr. Travolta and his wife, Kelly,"" Wilchcomb said. ""The people of the community of West End, particularly those who work at Old Bahama Bay, certainly today were in such shock, and they felt the tragedy because they had become a part of the community."" Wilchcomb said the Travoltas' love and affection for their son was apparent to those in the community.  See photos of Jett with his family » . ""Mr. Travolta spent a tremendous amount of time with his son, Jett. He never left him at home. He always brought him with him. And once you saw John Travolta, you saw his son, Jett. They were very close, very affectionate. Lots of love, you see at all times,"" Wilchcomb said. The family was on the island this weekend for a gathering of 60 family and friends who were arriving throughout the day as the tragedy unfolded, Wilchcomb said. In 1994, Travolta told People magazine that he loved fatherhood. ""I can't imagine what life would be like without Jett,"" he said. ""After he was born and cleaned up, I held him for hours while Kelly slept. When they came to take him away for various tests, I said, 'No, you can't see him today. You'll have to do it another day.' I went a little nutsy."" Jett Travolta had a developmental disability that his parents, John Travolta and Kelly Preston, have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children and can lead to heart disease.  Watch CNN's Sunjay Gupta discuss Kawasaki disease » . In 2001, John Travolta told CNN's Larry King that his son had a near brush with death related to the condition. ""I was obsessive about cleaning -- his space being clean, so we constantly had the carpets cleaned. And I think, between him, the fumes and walking around, maybe picking up pieces or something, he got what is rarely a thing to deal with, but it's Kawasaki syndrome,"" Travolta said of his then-2-year-old son.  Watch Travolta talk about his son's condition » . ""It was that the immune system overreacts, because they have almost the equivalent of metallic chemical,"" Travolta said. In 2003, Kelly Preston told Montel Williams that when Jett was 2, he became ill with flu symptoms, including fever, rashes and swollen lymph nodes, before a doctor diagnosed him with Kawasaki disease. Echoing her husband's comments, Preston blamed chemicals in household cleaners and pesticides for attacking her son's immune system, triggering the condition. A dedicated Scientologist, Preston told Williams that she credited a detoxification program from the writings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard with helping improve her son's health. Kawasaki disease is characterized by fevers and inflammation in the blood vessels that can be caused by a number of inciting factors, including virus, bacteria or infection, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on ""Larry King Live."" ""You get pretty sick for a few days. In the worst-case scenario, sometimes it can affect the blood vessels of the heart, called the coronary arteries,"" Gupta said. ""Sometimes they can develop aneurysms in it. That's probably the most dangerous thing. But again, this is typically a disease associated with young children. It's typically in Japan, and it's pretty rare."" Gupta said it was rare for teens to display symptoms of the disease, which usually occurs in young children. ""Most of the patients are usually between 2 and 5 years old. Sometimes they get up to age 8. But it's very rare in fact for someone to be in their teens and still have symptoms of Kawasaki. They may have had it earlier in life, but to still have any manifestations of it is unusual,"" he said. The causes of Kawasaki disease are unknown. Some scientists think it's caused by an infectious agent, such as a virus. Some studies have noted a link between the disease and carpet cleaning chemicals. John Travolta gained fame in the 1970s, starring in the television series ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and the movies ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease."" His career got a boost in 1994 with his second Best Actor Oscar nomination, for his role as a hit man in ""Pulp Fiction."" He also wrote and illustrated a 42-page novel for his son called ""Propeller One-Way Night Coach,"" a ""fable for the ages"" about a young boy whose first trip on an airplane changes his life forever, according to Amazon.com. It was a nod to Travolta's experience as a licensed pilot. Preston has numerous TV and movie credits, including a supporting role in 1996's ""Jerry Maguire.""

"Justice Clarence Thomas rarely speaks from the bench but his comments in less formal settings are often illuminating, often controversial -- especially on race. It is a topic that continues to engage the national debate, especially when it comes from the mind of the Supreme Court's only African-American jurist. Thomas spoke this week at a small gathering of students and faculty at a Florida college, where he echoed previous statements on the not-so subtle racism he remembers experiencing when leaving his native South. ""The worst I have been treated was by northern liberal elites. The absolute worst I have ever been treated,"" the 65-year-old justice said. ""The worst things that have been done to me, the worst things that have been said about me, are by northern liberal elites, not by the people of Savannah, Georgia,"" his hometown. His comments were first reported by Yahoo! News, but confirmed by several people who attended the Tuesday event at Palm Beach Atlantic University, a nondenominational Christian school. Social media reaction strong . The reaction from social media has been strong, reflecting the unique pull Thomas commands, despite his low-key, press-adverse persona. That theme of personal, political, and cultural isolation in his early professional life informs much of Thomas' current views on hot-button issues like race, seen most keenly in rulings issued from the bench. Last year, he sided with the conservative majority to strike down a key section of the landmark Voting Rights Act, blocking the federal government from using its most potent enforcement tool. No longer can the Justice Department rely on a decades-old formula to require states with a past history of voter discrimination against minorities to ""pre-clear"" any changes in their voting procedures. In a concurrence, Thomas went further, saying the Voting Rights Act provision was completely outdated and unconstitutional. ""Today, our Nation has changed,"" he wrote. A long-held belief . Now the justice's comments this week echo his long-held belief that government and society at large is overly focused and overly sensitive on trying to solve perceived racial problems. ""My sadness is that we are probably today more race and difference-conscious than I was in the 1960s when I went to school,"" he told students. ""To my knowledge, I was the first black kid in Savannah, Georgia, to go to a white [Catholic] school. Rarely did the issue of race come up. Now, name a day it doesn't come up. Differences in race, differences in sex, somebody doesn't look at you right, somebody says something. Everybody is sensitive. If I had been as sensitive as that in the 1960s, I'd still be in Savannah. Every person in this room has endured a slight. Every person."" Thomas has also consistently voted as a justice to eliminate affirmative action in college admission criteria, including a case from last term. ""Although cloaked in good intentions, the university's racial tinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping,"" said Thomas in a June decision limiting use of race at the University of Texas to achieve diversity in the student body. Comments are familiar . CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Wednesday the justice's latest comments are familiar. ""This is very consistent with how he has expressed himself about race throughout his entire career,"" said Toobin. ""Race is something to be overcome by individual initiative. Any problems you might have can be overcome by hard work and not collective action."" Thomas has long been perceived as a contradiction, an African-American man and self-professed civil rights activist in college with liberal views, who became increasingly conservative as his career advanced in government. He wrote about the transformation in his memoir, ""My Grandfather's Son,"" saying he felt ""tricked"" by whites, when recruited to attend Yale Law School. ""I was bitter toward the white bigots whom I held responsible for the unjust treatment of blacks,"" he wrote. ""But even more bitter toward those ostensibly unprejudiced whites who pretended to side with black people while using them to further their own political and social ends."" Most famously, he voiced that frustration during his 1991 Senate confirmation to the high court, when aggressively fighting off accusations of prior sexual harassment. ""This is a circus. It's a national disgrace. It is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves,"" he said. Sources close to him say the memories of his wrenching public ordeal are not forgotten by any means, but the experience, they say, has given him a greater appreciation of the unique role he now occupies. Controversial hearing . For most Americans, Thomas slipped into virtual anonymity after he took his judicial oath. He shuns interviews and rarely speaks during arguments. In fact, he has gone eight years without speaking substantively, when cases are presented in the public sessions. But those close to him say you don't know the real Clarence Thomas. ""Justice Thomas is known as being quiet and taciturn, and hasn't asked a question in years,"" said Carrie Severino, a 2007 law clerk who remains close to him. ""He's actually an incredibly great storyteller. He could talk for hours very easily. If you do get into a conversation with him, it's normally a very long and engaging process."" Behind the closed marble hallways of the court, Thomas is well known for his booming voice, hearty laugh, and friendly manner. Colleagues say they are amazed he seems to know every one of the several hundred employees by their names, as well as their families and their problems. He shatters the mold in many ways, and is especially close friends on the court with Justice Stephen Breyer, whose views are considered liberal. The two can often be spotted on the bench whispering in each other's ears, sharing an occasional laugh. ""There are a lot of people who don't like the fact that he breaks their expectations,"" Severino said. ""They expect him as an African-American to be toeing the liberal line, and he's his own man. You know, he's his own man among conservatives. He's not following Justice (Antonin) Scalia, he's not following Chief Justice (John) Roberts. He's going to do his own thing. And the people who might expect him to follow their lead are going to be disappointed."" Doing his own thing . Doing his own thing has often meant Thomas is a lone dissenter in cases big and small, in issues ranging from state-federal authority to executive immunity and government regulation. The consistency of his conservative views has earned him a quietly influential power base among his colleagues, which only recently has begun to attract public notice. ""In several of the most important areas of constitutional law, Thomas has emerged as an intellectual leader of the Supreme Court,"" said Toobin in a 2011 ""New Yorker"" essay. ""Since the arrival of Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005, and Justice Samuel Alito in 2006, the court has moved to the right when it comes to the free-speech rights of corporations, the rights of gun owners, and potentially, the powers of the federal government; in each of these areas, the majority has followed where Thomas been leading for a decade or more. Rarely has a Supreme Court justice enjoyed such broad or significant vindication."" But anger and disappointment remain among many in the African-American community. ""It is severely disturbing. I won't call it disappointing, because I didn't expect anything different from Justice Thomas,"" said Mark Lamont Hill, a CNN political commentator and Columbia University professor, about these latest remarks. ""He suggested race doesn't matter, that race shouldn't matter or be a factor in any decision-making process. This ignores reality of race that persists today."" Despite the public focus on skin color during his comments in Florida, Thomas' broader message was one of faith and public service, topics he feels far more comfortable addressing in such forums. As one of six Catholics on the bench, Thomas noted his religious upbringing helps in the role as a judge, where he is ""in the right place to do hard things."" ""I quite frankly don't know how you do these hard jobs without some faith,"" he concluded.","Supreme Court justice doesn't speak from the bench .

"A new possibility for a diplomatic solution in the standoff between Syria and the United States surfaced unexpectedly Monday as the war-torn country said it supported a proposal to hand over control of its chemical weapons. But a key question loomed: Is that a viable option or simply a stall tactic as President Bashar al-Assad's government tries to stave off U.S. military action? ""It's certainly a positive development when the Russians and Syrians both make gestures towards dealing with these chemical weapons,"" President Barack Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Monday. Asked whether the proposed idea was enough to avert a military strike on Syria, Obama said, ""It's possible if it's real."" The U.S. president spoke hours after Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem told reporters in Moscow that his nation ""welcomes"" a proposal that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made during talks on Monday. The idea: put Syria's chemical weapons under international control to avert a U.S. military response over an alleged poison gas attack last month. ""I declare that the Syrian Arab Republic welcomes Russia's initiative, on the basis that the Syrian leadership cares about the lives of our citizens and the security in our country,"" Moallem said. ""We are also confident in the wisdom of the Russian government, which is trying to prevent an American aggression against our people."" Secretary of State John Kerry discussed a similar scenario earlier Monday, though the State Department later said that al-Assad could not be trusted to relinquish his country's chemical stockpiles. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Washington remained ""highly skeptical"" of the Syrian regime. ""The only reason why we are seeing this proposal is because of the threat of U.S. military action,"" he said. Taking a 'hard look' Obama said the United States will work with Russia and the international community ""to see if we can arrive at something that is enforceable and serious."" The United States will take a ""hard look"" at the plan, deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. But ""we can't have this be another stalling tactic,"" she said, adding that the Syrian president's track record doesn't bode well. ""Everything that Assad has done over the past two years and before has been to refuse to put his chemical weapons under international control,"" she said. ""He hasn't declared them. We've repeatedly called on him to do so. And he's ignored prohibitions against them."" Latest developments . The new possibility of a diplomatic deal appeared to have started with comments from Kerry earlier Monday. Asked whether there was anything al-Assad's government could do or offer that would stop an attack, Kerry said that al-Assad ""could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week."" Speaking at a news conference with British Foreign Secretary William Hague, the U.S. secretary of state described that as an impossible scenario. ""He isn't about to do it,"" Kerry said. ""And it can't be done, obviously."" U.S. official: Kerry ""clearly went off script"" But as Russia and Syria later suggested that it could be done, one U.S. official called Kerry's remarks a ""major goof,"" adding that America's top diplomat ""clearly went off script."" ""There is no one in the administration who is taking this Syria proposal seriously,"" the official said. Several State Department representatives tried to clarify Kerry's remarks later in the day, calling them a ""rhetorical argument."" ""His point was that this brutal dictator (al-Assad) with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts cannot be trusted to turn over chemical weapons, otherwise he would have done so long ago,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""That's why the world faces this moment."" Kerry's comments caught Russia's attention . It wasn't long before the remarks came up in a conversation between Lavrov and Kerry, who talked on the phone as the U.S. secretary of state flew back from London. ""I saw your comments this morning,"" Lavrov said to Kerry, according to a senior State Department official. During a 14-minute conversation that had been previously scheduled, the Russian foreign minister said he would speak out about the issue but played down the idea that a proposal was on the table, the official said. Kerry told Lavrov that the United States ""is not going to 'play games,'"" the official said. ""If there is a serious proposal, we will take a look."" Hillary Clinton weighs in . Could 'goof' be solution? The comments from Kerry and counterparts in Russia and Syria are the latest twist in an international crisis that has also become a fierce political battle in the United States. The Obama administration says the al-Assad government was behind an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus. And the U.S. president is seeking congressional approval for a military strike in response. So far he's met resistance from lawmakers and the public who are concerned about the United States again intervening militarily in a foreign crisis. On Monday, Harf said looking at the Russian proposal doesn't mean the White House is backing down from its push to get authorization to strike Syria. ""In fact, the opposite. .... We think this is why it's even more important that Congress votes to authorize the president to use military action against Syrian regime targets, because we can be clear that if we don't give authorization to do so and we don't respond, then Assad will see that as a green light to continue using these chemical weapons."" But could Kerry's possible gaffe be the key to a diplomatic solution? Commentator Andrew Sullivan says he hopes so. ""We have the possibility of two things: that Russia might actually act decisively to rein Assad in, and also support the only viable policy to accomplish what Obama wants -- protecting the world from these vile weapons,"" Sullivan wrote Monday. ""I have no idea whether this is a serious move by Lavrov -- but it sure seems so, and it presents a fascinating non-binary option. ... Sometimes, it seems, Kerry's incompetence strikes gold. Here's hoping."" Whatever happens, the prospect of a diplomatic deal is likely going to make the Obama administration's attempts to make a case before Congress even more difficult, said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Lawmakers who are already debating whether or not to pass resolutions authorizing military action now may want to rewrite them, he said. ""It's going to obviously throw a monkey wrench in the gears on a number of things,"" he said. There's already been at least one delay. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is holding off on taking steps toward a first vote. An aide said that the Russia proposal is serious and fluid enough that members do not want to lock themselves into a position on Syria just yet. An initial Senate vote on whether to authorize a military strike against Syria had been expected on Wednesday. Reaction in the United States, beyond . French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the Russian proposal ""deserves a thorough examination."" It would be acceptable under several conditions, Fabius said. Al-Assad should immediately hand over control of the weapons and allow their destruction, he said, calling for the U.N. Security Council to pass a binding resolution with ""firm consequences."" ""Since the beginning, France has set two goals: punishment and deterrence,"" he said. ""That is why we are now asking specific, rapid and verifiable commitments by the Syrian regime."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she would ""welcome"" Lavrov's call for Syria to transfer control of its chemical weapons ""to prevent an international strike."" ""I believe that Russia can be most effective in encouraging the Syrian president to stop any use of chemical weapons and place all his chemical munitions, as well as storage facilities, under United Nations control until they can be destroyed,"" the California Democrat said. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said getting Syria to surrender the stockpiles ""would be an important step."" ""But this cannot be another excuse for delay or obstruction,"" Clinton said during an event at the White House Monday. ""And Russia has to support the international community's efforts sincerely or be held to account.""

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI has canceled a planned visit to a prestigious Italian university after a protest by academics and students attacked his views on Galileo, the Vatican confirmed Tuesday. The pope had been due to give a speech at La Sapienza university in Rome Thursday to open its academic year. However, the visit drew criticism from academics at the university who signed a letter demanding that the trip be called off. Separately, students protested outside the university, carrying banners insisting the university is a lay institution and the pope is not welcome. ""Given the events of the past days regarding the visit of the Holy Father to La Sapienza university upon the rector's invitation, which was scheduled to take place Thursday, January 17, it was decided to postpone the event,"" the Vatican said in a short written statement. Father Ciro Benedettini, a spokesman for the Vatican, confirmed to CNN the academic protests had prompted the cancellation. In the letter, academics -- pointing to a speech the pope gave at the same university as a cardinal in 1990 -- claimed he condones the 1633 trial and conviction of the scientist Galileo for heresy. The astronomer had argued that the Earth revolved around the Sun, in contradiction to church teachings at the time, and he was forced to renounce his findings publicly. In comments made 15 years ago when he was still a cardinal, Pope Benedict is reported to have called the trial ""reasonable and just."" During his speech, the pope -- then Cardinal Ratzinger -- quoted an Austrian philosopher Paul Feyerabend, saying, ""At the time of Galileo, the church remained more loyal (or faithful) to reason than Galileo himself. Andreas Srova, a physics professor at the university, said it would have been inappropriate for the pope to appear for the inauguration. Srova, who signed the protest letter and is the author of a book detailing the 1633 trial, said he is ""very satisfied"" that the Vatican decided to cancel the trip. ""We have no objections to the pope visiting at any other time when there can be exchanges of opinion, but not at the inauguration,"" he said. ""It was a mistake to ask him to come at this time."" CNN's Rome bureau chief Alessio Vinci said it was quite extraordinary for the pope to cancel the visit just because of the objections of the students and professors. It Is especially surprising, he said, given that this is the same pope that made a controversial visit to Turkey last year. Pope Benedict went to the predominantly Muslim country despite strained relations between the Vatican and the Islamic world following a lecture the pope gave at a German university in which he made unflattering comments about the Islamic faith.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Pentagon said Monday that Chinese ships harassed a U.S. surveillance ship Sunday in the South China Sea in the latest of several instances of ""increasingly aggressive conduct"" in the past week. The Navy says this photo shows two Chinese trawlers forcing the Impeccable to make an emergency ""all stop."" During the incident, five Chinese vessels ""shadowed and aggressively maneuvered in dangerously close proximity to USNS Impeccable, in an apparent coordinated effort to harass the U.S. ocean surveillance ship while it was conducting routine operations in international waters,"" the Pentagon said in a written statement. The crew members aboard the vessels, two of which were within 50 feet, waved Chinese flags and told the U.S. ship to leave the area, the statement said. ""Because the vessels' intentions were not known, Impeccable sprayed its fire hoses at one of the vessels in order to protect itself,"" the statement said. ""The Chinese crewmembers disrobed to their underwear and continued closing to within 25 feet."" After the Impeccable alerted the Chinese ships ""in a friendly manner"" that it was seeking a safe path to depart the area, two of the Chinese ships stopped ""directly ahead of USNS Impeccable, forcing Impeccable to conduct an emergency 'all stop' in order to avoid collision,"" the statement said. ""They dropped pieces of wood in the water directly in front of Impeccable's path."" A Pentagon spokesman called the incident ""one of the most aggressive actions we've seen in some time. We will certainly let Chinese officials know of our displeasure at this reckless and dangerous maneuver."" He said the Chinese crew members used poles to try to snag the Impeccable's acoustic equipment in the water.  Watch CNN's Chris Lawrence report on the incident » . The U.S. Embassy in Beijing lodged a protest over the weekend with the Chinese government, a State Department spokesman said Monday. The Impeccable's crew is composed primarily of civilians and the ship itself is not armed, the spokesman said. No one at the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing answered CNN's telephone calls seeking comment, and there were no stories about the incident in Chinese media. The 281.5-foot Impeccable is one of six surveillance ships that perform military survey operations, according to the Navy. It is an oceanographic ship that gathers underwater acoustic data, using sonar. It has a maximum speed of 13 knots -- or about 15 mph -- but it travels 3 knots, or 3.5 mph, when towing its array of monitoring equipment. It carries a crew of 20 mariners, five technicians and as many as 20 Navy personnel. The Chinese ships involved were a Navy intelligence collection ship, a Bureau of Maritime Fisheries Patrol Vessel, a State Oceanographic Administration patrol vessel and two small Chinese-flagged trawlers, the statement said. The Pentagon cited three previous instances of what it described as harassment, the first of which occurred Wednesday, when a Chinese Bureau of Fisheries Patrol vessel used a spotlight to illuminate the the ocean surveillance ship USNS Victorious. In that incident, which occurred about 125 miles from China's coast in the Yellow Sea, the Chinese ship ""crossed Victorious' bow at a range of about 1,400 yards"" in darkness without notice or warning. The following day, a Chinese Y-12 maritime surveillance aircraft conducted 12 fly-bys of Victorious at an altitude of about 400 feet and a range of 500 yards. The next day, a Chinese frigate approached Impeccable ""and proceeded to cross its bow at a range of approximately 100 yards,"" which was followed less than two hours later by a Chinese Y-12 aircraft conducting 11 fly-bys of Impeccable at an altitude of 600 feet and a range of 100 to 300 feet, the statement said. ""The frigate then crossed Impeccable's bow yet again, this time at a range of approximately 400-500 yards without rendering courtesy or notice of her intentions."" And on Saturday, a Chinese intelligence collection ship challenged Impeccable over bridge-to-bridge radio, ""calling her operations illegal and directing Impeccable to leave the area or 'suffer the consequences,' "" the statement said. In 2007, the Pentagon filed a formal protest with Beijing over its refusal to allow a U.S. aircraft carrier to make a Thanksgiving port call in Hong Kong so its crew could spend the American holiday with relatives and over its refusal to grant refuge to two U.S. minesweeping ships that were caught in a storm. And in 2001, an EP-3 surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet and made an emergency landing on China's Hainan Island, where the Chinese held the plane's 24 American crew members for 11 days before releasing them. CNN's Yuli Yang contributed to this report from Beijing, China.","State Department says U.S. Embassy in Beijing has lodged protest .

"(CNN)I was saddened to learn of the passing of Leonard Nimoy, a fellow space traveler because he helped make the journey into the final frontier accessible to us all. Nimoy's Mr. Spock in the original ""Star Trek"" television show, followed by the series of movies, proved to be a seminal, enduring and endearing character. While the late Neil Armstrong's ""one small step for man,"" as we began our exploration of the Moon back in July 1969, is ageless, so, too, is Spock's iconic ""live long and prosper,"" a phrase that also spans time and space. It brought out the Vulcan in all of us; that, for me, translated into a peaceful progression of exploring the vastness of outer space for all mankind. Nimoy's quite logical and always calm Spock struck me as an ideal person to have with us onboard a spaceship headed into the unknown. I also admit to being jealous of how much room was available on the USS Enterprise -- far from the cramped quarters allotted space travelers of past, present and future! Fans honor Nimoy with tweets, Vulcan salute . Leonard's final communiqué to his fans read: ""A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory,"" followed by ""LLAP,"" the acronym for live long and prosper. For all of us, Leonard Nimoy is in our collective memories as a passionate, inspirational and creative soul who beamed us all up on an enterprising voyage of exploration and discovery. Be assured, there is a great need to reaffirm our country's space exploration goals. Thanks to Mr. Spock, the stage is set -- in more ways than one -- to continue our voyage outward into deep space. During the next few years we must choose whether we rebound as a vibrant nation leading our global civilization toward a permanent presence beyond Earth, or relinquish American leadership in space. I recently testified before Congress, and in my opinion, there is no more convincing way to demonstrate American leadership for the remainder of this century than on July 20, 2019, the 50th anniversary of our landing on the moon, to commit to and strive toward a permanent human presence on Mars. Barack Obama: 'I loved Spock' Indeed, there are strange new worlds to explore -- to seek out new life and start new civilizations. It is time to boldly go where no man -- or woman -- has gone before.

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- A manhunt for a suspect in the shooting deaths of four police officers stretched into Monday night after the man appeared to have eluded authorities in an east Seattle neighborhood. Maurice Clemmons, 37, is wanted in connection with what investigators called an ambush of the four officers from Lakewood, about 40 miles south of Seattle, on Sunday morning. Witnesses say Clemmons was shot during the attack, and police believe he is losing blood, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. Police surrounded a home in eastern Seattle's Leschi neighborhood for about 12 hours, but Clemmons was not found in the home when the siege was lifted Monday morning, Seattle police spokesman Jeff Kappel told reporters. Clemmons was believed to have been outside the home Sunday night, but apparently slipped out of the area, Kappel said. His escape was ""an unlucky thing for us, and a lucky thing for him,"" Troyer said Monday night. ""But his luck's going to run out, because he doesn't have people to help him do that any more,"" Troyer said. Police have arrested several people they believe helped Clemmons flee, he said. The killings took place at a coffee shop in Parkland, a suburb of Tacoma. Authorities identified the victims as Sgt. Mark Renninger, 39; Officer Ronald Owens, 37; Officer Tina Griswold, 40; and Officer Greg Richards, 42. Early Monday, authorities started identifying Clemmons as a suspect, rather than as someone wanted for questioning. The night before the shootings, Clemmons threatened to kill police officers, but witnesses did not report those threats until after the slayings, Troyer said on ""Good Morning America."" Clemmons is a convicted criminal with a long rap sheet in Washington and Arkansas, according to authorities and documents. He was accused of child rape and assaulting a police officer in May, and was released on $150,000 bond five days before the shootings, according to court records. After his arrest, Clemmons' sister told police that he ""had not been himself lately"" and that his behavior was ""unpredictable and erratic."" ""He had said that the Secret Service was coming to get him because he had written a letter to the president,"" an affidavit quoted her as telling investigators. In addition, neighbors complained he threw rocks through their windows. Clemmons' wife told deputies that she and her husband argued over a ""newly discovered child,"" and she suggested that was why he went on his rock-throwing spree, according to an arrest affidavit. Clemmons was given a 95-year prison sentence in Arkansas in 1989 for a host of charges, including robbery, burglary, theft and bringing a gun to school. His sentence was commuted in 2000 by then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Troyer said. Read the documents for Clemmons' clemency . Clemmons returned to prison in 2001, but was paroled in 2004. ""Should he be found responsible for this horrible tragedy, it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state,"" Huckabee's office said in a statement Sunday night. During his 2008 presidential bid, Huckabee was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate, convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri. Huckabee's statement brought a sharp response from Troyer on Monday. ""We're disappointed that Gov. Huckabee came out in the middle of the night without calling anybody here and blamed this on the criminal justice system in the state of Washington,"" Troyer said. ""We're guessing that's probably a spin doctor, not him."" Sunday's shooting was the first for the Lakewood Police Department, which was created five years ago for the town of nearly 60,000. Until then, the Pierce County sheriff's office provided law-enforcement services there. Police Chief Bret Farrar told reporters Monday he has repeatedly been asked how the city's officers are doing. ""This is how everybody's doing,"" Farrar said, gesturing to the police force standing behind him. ""They're here. They're doing their jobs. They're working hard. They're dealing with their loss. ... We're here to carry on. This is what we do."" The four officers ""were good people,"" Farrar said, fighting to maintain his composure. ""They were great officers, and we will all miss them very much."" The Lakewood Independent Police Guild is accepting donations for the officers' families, said guild president and Lakewood police officer Brian Wurts. Contributions have come from as far away as Switzerland, he said. ""I can't believe he was out on the street,"" Wurts said of the suspect. ""You have 5 percent of the people out here committing 90 percent of the crime -- not against just us, but against all of you. And we've got to hold these people accountable. We've got to keep them locked up. And if they want to rehabilitate them, you can rehabilitate them, but you rehabilitate them in prison, where they're supposed to be. This guy should have never been on the street."" The coffee shop on Steele Street is a popular hangout for law enforcement officers and is one of 22 Forza Coffee Co. locations in Washington. ""As a retired police officer, this senseless shooting hits extremely close to home to me,"" Brad Carpenter, chief executive officer of Forza, said in a statement on the company's Web site. Police said there was no warning. The shooter walked past the officers to the counter as if to order coffee before he pulled a gun out of his coat and began shooting at 8:15 a.m. Sunday, Troyer said. Two of the officers were ""executed"" as they sat at a table, said Troyer, the sheriff's spokesman. Another was shot when he stood up and the fourth was shot after struggling with the gunman all the way out the door, Troyer said. All were in uniform, with their marked patrol cars parked outside. Two coffee shop employees and other customers inside the shop were unharmed. ""Just the law enforcement officers were targeted,"" Troyer said. ""After, we believe, some of the officers were shot, one of them managed to fight his way with the suspect -- fight his way, wrestle, fight all the way out the doorway until he was shot and died of a gunshot wound,"" he told reporters. Griswold' sister, Tiffany Ryan, told reporters her ""worst nightmare has come true."" ""I can't tell you how painful it is to lose my sister,"" she said. ""If that man is watching this ... I want him to know what he took from us. I won't ever get to see her again. She won't ever get to watch her children grow and her daughter get married and have children.""

"(CNN) -- When Seattle pot smokers got the munchies this weekend, the cops had their back. Now that marijuana is legal in Washington, there's not much police could do about weed-toting revelers at the city's Hempfest. But they did want to explain the new rules surrounding recreational marijuana use in the state -- and hit upon a novel distribution format: Doritos. Sticking the cops' messages on something edible was a no-brainer, Seattle police Sgt. Sean Whitcomb said. ""We knew if we did leaflets, it would turn into litter,"" he said. ""We wanted people to be able to access the information. It's actually fun to read. We wanted to do it in a way that is deliberately ironic."" Each bag contained some sage Dos and Don'ts. The Don'ts included ""Don't drive while high,"" and ""Don't use pot in public. You could be cited but we'd rather give you a warning."" And the Dos? ""Do listen to Dark Side of the Moon at a reasonable volume."" The crowd ate it up. In less than 30 minutes, police ran out of all 1,000 bags of chips during #OperationOrangeFingers. CNN iReport: Photos of Operation Orange Fingers . Minor marijuana possession has been the Seattle's police department's lowest priority since 2003, but voters last year cast ballots to make recreational use legal. Initiative 502 says residents over 21 years old may possess up to an ounce of pot for personal use. There are also guidelines for the possession of oils and edibles. Hempfest, which began Friday and runs through Sunday, says its goal is ""to educate the public on the myriad of potential benefits offered by the cannabis plant, including the medicinal, industrial, agricultural, economic, environmental, and other benefits and applications."" The Seattle Police Foundation paid $260 for the Doritos, CNN affiliate KING said. ""I initially said let's try 500 Dorito bags, but we did a thousand. Ultimately our goal was to start a conversation,"" Whitcomb said. And it's worked. Some even tried hawking the Doritos bags on eBay. By the end of the giveaway, even the cops were feeling the effects of Hempfest. ""We're headed home. Feelin' kinda Spacey,"" the department tweeted, with a picture of actor Kevin Spacey speaking into a walkie-talkie. At least 1,000 revelers were cured of the munchies, with a little more knowledge of the state law and a little more orange on their fingers. CNN's Elliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Seattle police give away 1,000 bags of Doritos with advice about smoking pot on them .

"(CNN) -- Football has traditionally been a male preserve -- but no more, according to a U.S. academic who says social media is helping grow women's interest in the sport. Facebook statistics show female interest in teams considered World Cup underdogs -- such as Iran, Colombia, the U.S and Costa Rica -- is well over 40% in the number of posts mentioning those countries. Iran received over 472,927 social mentions, with 43% of those coming from women, while of the 3.25 million mentions relating to Costa Rica, 46% were from female contributors. ""The additional attention that social media has given the sport offers women additional outlets to access the tournament that they may not have traditionally had"", says Stacy Torres, a doctoral student in Sociology at New York University. ""Now women can follow the games more independently with social media and unprecedented streaming options,"" added Torres, an avid Chile fan who has written about the experience of being a Chile fan at the World Cup for New Republic. Of the people talking about Costa Rica's 1-0 surprise win over Italy in the group stages, 44% of them were women, while Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina has over 27,487 mentions on social media, with 61% of them women. ""There was strong engagement among younger women supporting Mexico, specifically mentioning ""Chicharito,"" -- Javier Hernandez's nickname, who scored the last goal in Mexico's game with Croatia,"" added a Facebook spokesman. Chile's success in the World Cup -- the South Americans were regarded as unlucky to go out in the last 16 stage after Brazil's penalty shootout win -- has arguably also shown the cultural significance of the tournament. ""This is what the World Cup is about,"" said Torres. ""My father has taught me how to relish Chile's flair, energy and heart. Today we feel sad and disappointed but not defeated.

"(CNN) -- Massive Hurricane Irene, packing 115 mph winds and laden with moisture, aimed late Thursday for the U.S. East Coast, where it is expected to spawn widespread damage and flooding from North Carolina to New England. A hurricane warning was issued for coastal North Carolina from Little River Inlet north to the Virginia border, including the Pamlico, Albemarle and Currituck sounds, the National Hurricane Center said. Category 3 Irene was turning and moving northward from the Bahamas. It will parallel the Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts Friday as it approaches a Saturday landfall in North Carolina. Tens of millions could be affected by its fury. Officials in counties and cities along much of the East Coast ordered evacuations. Amtrak and major U.S. airlines began canceling routes and flights or putting them on a watch list. American Airlines canceled 126 flights Thursday, mostly out of Miami and the Bahamas, an airline spokesman said. Airlines are expected to cancel more flights Friday. Sunday's dedication of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial in Washington was postponed until at least next month, officials announced Thursday night. Pro sports teams juggled their schedules while colleges from Virginia to New Hampshire closed their campuses or delayed dormitory move-ins. ""Everybody should take this very seriously,"" said North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue, who declared a state of emergency in counties east of Interstate 95. ""Everyone is telling us this is a big deal for North Carolina."" Hurricane Irene is expected to bear down on the North Carolina Outer Banks on Saturday, bristling with 110 mph winds. Irene will threaten metropolitan areas as it hugs the coast on Sunday and prepares for a possible second landfall in the Northeast, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. ""Extremely dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 5 to 10 feet above ground level within the hurricane warning area, including the Albemarle and Pamlico sounds,"" the hurricane center said. ""The surge will be accompanied by large, destructive and life-threatening waves."" A hurricane warning is issued 36 hours in advance of tropical storm-force winds. A hurricane has sustained winds of 74 mph or higher. A hurricane watch was issued from the Virginia-North Carolina border north to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, including Delaware Bay and the Chesapeake Bay south of Smith Point. ""Significant"" storm surge flooding was possible within the watch area. Hurricane watches, issued 48 hours in advance of tropical storm-force winds, indicate hurricane conditions are possible. A tropical storm warning, which indicates sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph are possible in the next 36 hours, was in effect for the coast of South Carolina from Edisto Beach northward to Little River Inlet. Rainfall amounts of 6 to 10 inches, with isolated maximums of 15 inches, were expected over portions of eastern North Carolina and in the Mid-Atlantic states along the path. Although the possibility of Irene growing to Category 4 was no longer in the Hurricane Center's forecast report, CNN meteorologists Sean Morris and Chad Myers said it is still a possibility. Six other governors declared states of emergency as Irene threatened to wreak havoc along the Eastern Seaboard. Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley declared emergencies for their states. The requested emergency declarations allow states to free funds and prepare resources that may be needed. President Barack Obama signed North Carolina's request later Thursday. ""We hope that the storm doesn't hit, but we have to do everything in our power to be prepared,"" said Malloy, who expects Irene to be a Category 1 hurricane when it reaches the region. Markell ordered all visitors to leave coastal areas in Delaware and urged residents to take shelter inland. If Irene continues along its current track, ""from a flooding perspective, this could be a hundred-year event,"" Christie said.  He encouraged voluntary evacuations to begin immediately. ""Anybody who is on a barrier island should go,"" he said. As of 11 p.m. ET Thursday, the Category 3 storm had moved away from Abaco Island in the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane and tropical storm conditions were subsiding over the northwestern Bahamas. Cat, San Salvador and Long islands ""took direct hits,"" said Gayle Outten-Moncur of Bahamas' National Emergency Management Agency. ""There has been bad flooding in some areas."" By Thursday afternoon, no deaths or injuries had been reported in the island chain. Officials reported widespread power outages, impassable roads, downed trees and flooding in some spots. Still, they expected tourists to return by the weekend. In the United States, many people were quick to move out of the storm's path. ""I didn't really want to take my chances,"" said Janeen Wall, who left her vacation spot in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, to make it back to Richmond, Virginia. ""Also, if I waited for an evacuation order, I would have to share the road with more than a few thousand other folks trying to leave at the same time."" A mandatory evacuation order was in effect for residents and visitors in Hyde County, North Carolina, which includes Ocracoke Island, reachable only by boat or private plane, on the Outer Banks. Clayton Gaskill was one of about 100 Ocracoke residents still around Thursday night. In between playing progressive rock songs on community radio WOVV-FM, he talked about residents making final preparations. ""You pick up stuff that will float."" Nearby Dare County, which includes Manteo, Nags Head, Duck and historic Kitty Hawk, had an evacuation order for tourists only. Carteret County also issued a mandatory evacuation order for visitors in part of the county. On Friday, there will be a mandatory evacuation for all residents of Bogue Banks, said county spokesman Rodney Cates. Currituck County said all residents must leave by 8 a.m. Friday. Pamlico County, North Carolina, Sheriff Bill Sawyer Jr. told CNN he talked with many fishermen and others who have been pulling their boats from the water and taking other precautions, adding ""when they're concerned, it's something really to be concerned about."" Ocean City, Maryland, Mayor Richard Meehan announced a mandatory evacuation beginning at midnight, CNN affiliate WUSA reported. Atlantic City, New Jersey, set a 6 a.m. Friday mandatory evacuation. Owners as far north as Maine scrambled to have their boats moved out of harm's way. CNN affiliate WCSH said Port Harbor Marine in South Portland was trying to move 100 boats a day through Saturday. ""Hopefully it won't be too big of a storm, but it's nothing to fool with,"" said Steve Theberge of Lewiston, whose boat was hoisted Thursday. ""You've got to pay attention. And if you have an opportunity to get the boat out of the water, it's the best way."" The cone of uncertainty -- the area that could be affected by Irene depending on what path it follows over the next several days -- includes much of the Northeast. Even if the hurricane does not make landfall, heavy rain could trigger flooding. ""The biggest concern is getting people to pay attention and make sure they are ready,"" Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate said in an interview with CNN. Residents should have the necessary supplies and an evacuation plan ready, he said. The storm could weaken as it works its way up the U.S. East Coast in the coming days. ""As it gets closer to the Northeast, it will run into the cooler Labrador Current, and that -- along with some more wind shear -- should allow Irene to lose some strength,"" said HLN meteorologist Bob Van Dillen. The U.S. Navy is sending 27 ships based in Norfolk, Virginia, out to sea to ride out Irene, a senior Navy official told CNN.  An aircraft carrier is among them.  Another 28 ships will seek more sheltered areas. Three submarines were heading out to sea as well. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said vulnerable patients in possibly affected hospitals, nursing homes and senior homes must be moved by 8 p.m. ET Friday. South Carolina state officials have decided not to order evacuations but urged boaters and swimmers to stay out of the water. The last major hurricane to strike the United States was Wilma in 2005, which was a Category 3 at landfall in southwest Florida, Jeras said.

Schoichet, Joe Sutton, Greg Botelho, Chris Boyette, Paul Corson, Eden Pontz, Laura Batchelor, Barbara Starr and John Fricke contributed to this report.","NEW: Hurricane begins turn toward the north, U.S.

"A U.S. defense official on Thursday dismissed North Korea's claim of testing newly developed missiles. ""There is no indication of new North Korean technology,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The U.S. military monitored what the defense official described as the routine launch of short-range missiles. Earlier, North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA reported that leader Kim Jong Un had ""guided the test-fire of newly developed cutting-edge ultra-precision tactical guided missiles."" ""At the central monitoring post he acquainted himself with the tactical and technological information of the newly developed guided missiles before giving an order to test-fire them. ""The moment the guided missiles soared into the sky with thunderous roar,"" the report read. According to the U.S. and South Korean governments, North Korea launched three projectiles from its southeastern coast. ""I think we're always concerned whenever North Korea launches anything,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. She added: ""We're monitoring the situation, and we're still evaluating the available information to identify the exact type of projectile that may have been launched."" Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said Friday that what North Korea launched appears to have been an improvement of an existing weapon, rather than an entirely new technology. The improvements were in the weapon's range and the guided technology, he told a regular news briefing. From the North Korean military's point of view, the weapon may be new, Kim said, ""but if you look at the international trend, this weapon technology was developed before.""

"(CNN) -- Walmart will join the Department of Homeland Security in a program called ""If You See Something, Say Something"" which encourages the American public to take an active role in ensuring the safety and security of the nation, DHS said Monday. ""Homeland security starts with hometown security, and each of us plays a critical role in keeping our country and communities safe,"" Secretary Janet Napolitano said as she thanked Walmart and the more than 320 stores who joined the national campaign Monday.

"(CNN) -- Comedian Chris Rock delivered on his reputation for controversy as host of ""Saturday Night Live"" this weekend, but musical guest Prince is the one soaking up accolades for making history. In a rare TV appearance, the artist performed one long, uninterrupted jam session instead of two songs, a first in the sketch show's 40-year run. The medley showcased songs from Prince's studio albums with band 3rdeyegirl and featured guest vocalist Lianne La Havas in what Rolling Stone called ""one of the most explosive and most polished 'SNL' musical spots"" in recent memory. The performance drew overwhelmingly positive praise, contrasting the mixed reviews Rock received for his second turn as host. The ""SNL"" alum wasted no time reminiscing over what it was like to be part of the cast in the early 1990s, or how it felt to return his old stomping grounds after last hosting 18 years ago. Instead, Rock dove right into the Boston Marathon bombing, the September 11 attacks, the commercialization of Christmas and gun control in his opening monologue. He poked fun at the Freedom Tower (""the 'Never Going in There' Tower"") as a terrorism target, and said it was only a matter of time before September 11 becomes an excuse to offer $9.11 shrimp specials at Red Lobster. To some it was humorous, maybe even tame for the comedian who took on the Columbine High School shootings days after the massacre. For others, the monologue didn't sit so well, especially the night before the New York City Marathon. Other memorable moments, for better or worse, included a mock diversity training video, ""Women in the Workplace,"" featuring Rock as a ""diverse person,"" and a sketch in which ISIS militants compete on on the ABC reality TV show, ""Shark Tank.""","Prince performs one eight-minute set instead of the traditional two shorter sets .

"A noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. Alcohol and racial slurs were hurled at a black student as she walked near the campus. These two recent, racially charged incidents have some wondering if the school affectionately called Ole Miss is still stuck in the old days. Some alumni say the incidents do not reflect the true character of their alma mater. In the meantime, the FBI is getting involved in one of the incidents. Special Agent Daniel McMullen on Friday said the bureau, along with university police, will expand the investigation to determine whether  any federal laws were broken in the incident Sunday, when a noose and a flag bearing a Confederate symbol were found placed on the statue of James Meredith. And an attorney for one of the three students sought for questioning in the statue incident said Friday there is video evidence that absolves his client. Ken Coghlan said according to law enforcement officials he spoke with, his client is not shown in a video recording of the incident, which occurred Sunday. ""He did not touch the statue. He was not near the statue. He didn't have any involvement with putting anything on the statue,"" Coghlan said. ""I'm extremely distressed and worried my client is being libeled by the university,"" the attorney said. Coghlan said his client has been ""ruled out"" by the university and has no plans to talk to university police at this time. A lawyer for another of the three accused declined comment Saturday. Danny Blanton, director of public relations for Ole Miss, said he is not aware of any video of the incident. Seeking arrests . In a phone interview, Lee Tyner, the general counsel for Ole Miss,  said those behind the act have been identified. ""We believe the three folks we've identified and provided information to prosecutors about were involved"" in the desecration of the statue, he said. The three 19-year-olds, whose identities have not been released by police, are from Georgia and are freshmen at Ole Miss, according to a statement from the university's chief of police, Calvin Sellers. Sellers said university police ""had gathered enough evidence by late Wednesday to bring charges through the student judicial process against two of the students, and both state and federal authorities were working in close coordination to determine whether criminal charges were applicable,"" the statement said. The students were set to appear for questioning with university police Thursday, but never showed up, according to the statement. Racial slurs alleged . In another reported incident involving an Ole Miss student, senior Kiesha Reeves reported to police that  Monday, someone threw alcohol at her from a moving car while shouting racial slurs. Reeves, who is African-American, said she was still emotionally affected by what happened. Police are investigating the incident, which occurred a few miles off campus at a residential complex that houses mostly Ole Miss students. ""It's unclear at this time if the incident is related to the incident last Sunday on campus,"" Oxford Deputy Police Chief James Owens said. ""This is pretty unusual. This is a college town. This doesn't usually happen here."" ""Not surprised"" James Meredith became the first black student admitted to Ole Miss in 1962. And it took a Supreme Court ruling and federal police presence to ensure his admittance. Meredith, 80, declined to speak about the noose incident. But his wife said she was not surprised that it happened. ""I'm shocked but not surprised by what happened,"" Judy Meredith said. ""I'm surprised something didn't happen to the statue earlier."" Meredith's son, John, added,  ""Obviously there is a little bit of work left to do in terms of our social fabric. ""My father always has said it's not a matter of civil rights, it is a matter of citizenship."" Ironically, James Meredith has said he is no fan of the statue, that he disapproves of it on biblical grounds and believes it should be removed from campus. ""It's a false idol, and it's an insult not only to God, it's an insult to me,"" he said in an interview with The New York Times. Fraternity to suspend Ole Miss chapter . On Friday, the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity said it was ""embarrassed"" to learn the three suspects were members of its organization. Not only would it expel the three students, the fraternity said, it was going to indefinitely suspend the whole Ole Miss chapter. ""For this to occur in 2014 is an insult to the legacy of James Meredith, The University of Mississippi community, and the SigEp alumni who fought for racial equality in the late 1950s,"" the fraternity said in a statement. Students who spoke with CNN affiliate WMC shared similar sentiments: . ""I just feel like whoever did that had to be completely ignorant to the impact that he had on this campus to deface school property and such a monumental statue like that,"" sophomore Raven Lyles said. ""I think it's absolutely terrible what they did,"" freshman John Choat said. ""I think they should pay for it."" ""To be honest, we haven't come as far as we think we've come,"" said another student, Bryston Tucker. Tuohy: Isolated ""stupidity"" is to blame . A few well-known university alums weighed in on the furor. NFL star Michael Oher, who played for the Ole Miss Rebels and was made famous after his story inspired the movie ""The Blind Side,"" took to Twitter on Monday to share his feelings. ""Can't believe they are still doing stuff like that at Ole Miss,"" he tweeted. ""Really a shame!!"" Leigh Anne Tuohy, the Ole Miss alumna who adopted Oher after she and her husband took him into their home at the age of 16, said of the statue's defacing, ""I tell people all the time, I wish there was a cure for cancer (and) heart disease, but more so stupidity."" However, she said, the university ""has gotten pigeonholed ... as being a racist school, and that is anything but the truth."" ""The truth of the matter is I had a black child at Ole Miss and a white child at Ole Miss,"" Tuohy said, ""and it was a wonderful experience."" Shay Hodge, a former Rebels wide receiver and teammate of Oher, said ""every school"" has its racists. But Hodge, who also is African-American says he ""always felt welcomed"" at Ole Miss. Racism ""happens in every campus, in every high school, in every community,"" Hodge said. ""Because it is not just white people towards blacks, it is blacks towards whites, whites towards Mexicans ...""","FBI to investigate for possible federal violations in Ole Miss statue incident .

"(CNN) -- Forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized president of Ivory Coast, attacked the residence of disputed incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and took control of state-run TV early Friday morning, a spokesman for Ouattara told CNN. Gbagbo's residence is near the state-run television station  taken over by Ouattara forces in the early morning hours Friday, said Patrick Achi, the Ouattara spokesman. Gbagbo apparently was not there. The takeover occured less than three hours after a Gbagbo spokesman appeared on the same network declaring that Gbagbo had no intention of leaving the presidential palace, according to a witness who saw the broadcast. The presidential palace is not Gbagbo's personal residence and is located elsewhere. Gbagbo has refused to cede power after a disputed November election. The takeover of the government network, which had previously been accused of inciting violence against protesters opposed to the Gbagbo government, came as Ivory Coast's internal war appeared to enter a decisive and final phase, with forces loyal to Ouattara making a final push to oust a defiant Gbagbo. Ouattara on Thursday declared a curfew in Abidjan as forces loyal to him moved closer to taking control of the city. The curfew, Ouattara said, will remain in effect until Sunday. Also Thursday, Ouattara's interior minister announced on radio that the air and sea borders of the country would be sealed until further notice. The curfew, however, did not seem to be universally recognized as Abidjan residents reported hearing sounds of heavy gunfire Thursday night. ""It seemed there was a battle going on,"" said Diallo Ibrahim, adding that the ""heavy gunfire"" appeared to subside by midnight Thursday. Ibrahim, an accountant, said he watched the Gbagbo spokesman appear on TV and declared that Gbagbo would not leave the presidential palace. After the announcement, however, the station went dark, Ibrahim said. Ouattara's spokesman, Patrick Achi, told CNN earlier Thursday that rebel forces were patrolling some streets of Abidjan and were fast closing in on Gbagbo. It will be only ""hours, maybe days"" before Gbagbo falls, Achi said. ""The army does not want to fight for Laurent Gbagbo."" Residents in Abidjan told CNN that people were frightened at the prospect of an all-out war and were huddled in their homes Thursday. At sunset, they could still hear the sound of gunfire outside. Smoke could be seen in some parts of the city. ""We can tell the fighting has gone to another level,"" said one resident who did not want to be named because of security reasons. ""We are watching to see what will happen next."" Humanitarian agencies warned Abidjan is on the brink of catastrophe. ""The international community must take immediate steps to protect the civilian population,"" said Salvatore Sagues, Amnesty International's researcher on West Africa. Choi Young-jin, head of the United Nations' mission in Ivory Coast, said on France Info radio that U.N. peacekeepers have taken the place of army and police who abandoned Gbagbo on Thursday. Choi said that the siege laid on the Abidjan hotel where Ouattara was confined has been lifted. Ouattara was recognized as the winner of a November presidential election but had been holed up in the U.N.-protected Golf Hotel since then as the political stalemate led to escalating violence and turmoil. Meanwhile, Gbagbo's army chief, Gen. Philippe Mangou, asked for asylum at the residence of the South African ambassador, the South African government said Thursday. Achi said it was a sign that the armed forces now stand fully behind Ouattara. Republican Forces wrested control of much of the capital, Yamoussoukro, and other key cocoa-producing and port cities earlier in the week before marching to Abidjan, the commercial center of Ivory Coast. Ouattara issued a statement saying that despite numerous attempts to end the violence, Gbagbo had refused. He said Ivory Coast is now at a turning point in its history and called for unity. ""In order to end the escalating violence in our country, the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast have started to put in place, in accordance with their missions, the protection of people and their property against the militia men and mercenaries paid by Laurent Gbagbo,"" Ouattara said. ""They have decided to restore democracy and to respect the vote of the people,"" he said. ""In every city where they went, they were greeted in jubilation."" Human rights agencies have documented the deaths of 462 people -- some in heinous fashion -- and the displacement of more than 1 million from their homes. Many residents in Abidjan fear Gbagbo will not go down easily. Koffi Kouakou, a citizen of Ivory Coast who now lives in South Africa, said his family members were stocking up on food and waiting for the battle they feel is inevitable. ""Everybody is calling it the battle of Abidjan,"" said Kouakou. ""There will be a battle and people will be killed, unfortunately. Nobody knows when it is going to happen but it will happen soon."" Concerned about the rising tide of violence, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to impose sanctions on Gbagbo, his wife and three associates, as well as give U.N. peacekeepers more authority to protect civilians. The U.N. resolution demands that Gbagbo step down immediately and that all state institutions, including the military, accept Ouattara as president. It also authorizes U.N. peacekeepers ""to use all necessary means to carry out its mandate to protect civilians under imminent threat of violence."" The resolution imposes targeted sanctions and travel bans on Gbagbo, his wife, Simone, and three others: Desire Tagro, Pascal Affi N'Guessan and Alcide Djedje. The resolution accuses all five of ""obstruction to the peace and reconciliation process"" and of rejecting the legitimate election of Ouattara. All but Laurent Gbagbo are accused of ""public incitement to hatred and violence.""

"(CNN)Shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, paralyzed veteran Tomas Young spoke with me about why he intended to end his life. He didn't know what people would say about him after he was gone. All he wanted, really, was to be remembered as a nice guy. He spoke with me by phone as a pump at his side helped him inject painkillers. His speech was so distorted that I had difficulty understanding him. He sent me photos showing how long and thick his hair and beard had grown. He said he seldom left his bed and that he popped a dizzying assortment of more than 30 different pills every day. Read why Young wanted to end his life . Young's ordeal began in 2004 when two rounds from a sniper's AK-47 severed his spinal cord. Tired of suffering, Young penned a scathing letter in 2013 to former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney. He laid out the painful circumstances of his life and blamed the former administration for the many casualties of that war. He said he would refuse his feeding tube and allow himself to die. He was the subject of the 2007 documentary, ""Body of War,"" and had become a vocal anti-war activist. He again made headlines when his death wish became public. But he didn't die then. He said he wanted to spend more time with his wife, Claudia Cuellar. Former television host Phil Donahue, co-director and executive producer of ""Body of War,"" said Wednesday that Tomas and Claudia made a remarkable love story. ""Theirs was a true love like I have never witnessed before,"" Donahue said. ""Tomas made it clear she was the reason he was alive."" The Uncounted: War's true toll . On Monday, Young died at home in Seattle. The cause of death was not immediately clear, according to media reports. Donahue said he had been waiting almost 10 years to hear what he heard on the phone Monday. ""This was a catastrophic injury,"" Donahue said. ""Tomas was imprisoned in bed. He couldn't even cough."" Young had moved with his wife to Portland, Oregon, where, as he stated in his Twitter profile, he was a ""happily married man who's happy to live in a medical maryjane state."" He was referring to legalized medical marijuana. I learned of his passing on Veterans Day. Appropriate, I thought, for as controversial as Young had been, I believed he remained true to his convictions. When we spoke last year, he asked me about my experiences covering the war in Iraq. We talked about the soldiers I met who lost their lives or returned home with serious injuries, both physical and psychological. A soldier's war on two fronts . Cuellar told me then she was frightened at the prospect of losing her husband, but that she always returned to thinking about how difficult it was for him every single day. ""There will be time to mourn when he dies,"" Cuellar told me. ""Until that day, I will love and cherish and celebrate him and try to make each day as loving and happy and comfortable as possible for him."" And she did. In a video posted on YouTube Tuesday, Young's sister-in-law, Amanda Young, captured his 34 years of life -- from a baby who put a gleam in his mother's eye to a companion for his brother Nathan; from a young man who felt compelled to serve his nation after the terror attacks of 9/11 to a wounded veteran who became a poster child for those who opposed the U.S. role in Iraq. Young returned home from war a broken man. He is now free from his pain. In an online memorial, people thanked him for his service. Young was a self-avowed atheist, but somehow I could feel him smiling down at his friends, glad that they were remembering him as a nice guy.

"(CNN) -- A Kansas jury deliberated just 37 minutes before convicting an anti-abortion activist of first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of an abortion provider. The  jury found Scott Roeder, 51, guilty of gunning down Dr. George Tiller, who operated a clinic in Wichita where late-term abortions were performed. Roeder, 51, faces life in prison when he is sentenced on March 9. Tiller's family said the jury reached a ""just"" verdict. ""At this time we hope that George can be remembered for his legacy of service to women, the help he provided for those who needed it and the love and happiness he provided us as a husband, father and grandfather,"" the family said in a written statement. A day earlier, Roeder told jurors he had shot Tiller in the foyer of Reformation Lutheran Church as Sunday services began. Testifying as his only defense witness, he said he believed he had to kill Tiller to save lives. He said he had no regrets. ""There was nothing being done, and the legal process had been exhausted, and these babies were dying every day,"" Roeder said. ""I felt that if someone did not do something, he was going to continue."" ""His testimony was delivered very matter-of-factly, but its contents were chillingly horrific,"" prosecutor Ann Swengel said in her closing argument. ""He carried out a planned assassination, and there can be no other verdict in this case ... other than guilty."" Quick verdict surprised prosecutor . Prosecutors initially fought to keep abortion out of the trial, claiming that Tiller's death was a straightforward case of premeditated murder. Eventually, the abortion issue took center stage as prosecutors portrayed Tiller as a target of Roeder's anti-abortion agenda, and defense lawyers attempted to mitigate his culpability under the theory that he believed Tiller's death was justified to save the lives of others. Defense attorney Mark Rudy told jurors in his closing argument that Roeder ""thought that the babies kept on dying"" and he had to stop Tiller from ""killing more babies."" Another defense attorney, Steve Osburn, said Roeder was ""disappointed,"" with the verdict. But he added, ""He's known that this day was going to come, I think."" Osburn said his client ""feels remorse toward the family, but not for what he did."" The trial drew activists from both sides of the abortion debate to the courtroom, and a van plastered with slogans and photographs of fetuses was parked in a prominent spot in front of the courthouse. Among the attendees were the Rev. Michael Bray, whose history in the anti-abortion movement includes 1985 conspiracy convictions in connection with a string of clinic bombings, and Katherine Spillar, executive vice president of the Feminist Majority Foundation. Congregants from Reformation Lutheran testified that they had seen Roeder at church several times before the day he killed Tiller by shooting him at point-blank range in the head. Jurors heard emotional testimony from church-goers who rushed to Tiller's side and attempted to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as he lay in a pool of blood. Others, meanwhile, followed Roeder into the church parking lot, where he threatened to shoot them. Roeder also was convicted of aggravated assault in connection with threats he made to two ushers, Gary Hoepner and Keith Martin. As Roeder pulled away in his car, Martin testified, something moved him to throw the coffee cup he was holding at the vehicle. ""Frustration, I guess, lack of accomplishment, nothing else to do."" Prosecutors also called employees of the pawn shop where Roeder purchased the .22-caliber Taurus pistol believed to have been used to shoot Tiller. The gun was never found, but surveillance video and receipts showed that he purchased the gun on May 18 and received it on May 23, the week before he shot Tiller. Roeder's defense team did not dispute much of the factual evidence. Roeder testified that he chose to target Tiller at church because it presented the best ""window of opportunity"" to attack Tiller, who traveled in an armored vehicle and whose clinic was a ""fortress."" He admitted bringing the pistol with him to Lutheran Reformation on May 24 with the intention of shooting Tiller, but the physician did not attend services that day. So, Roeder testified, he returned the following week. ""Do you feel as though you've successfully completed your mission?"" Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston asked Roeder on Thursday. ""He's been stopped,"" Roeder answered. His testimony was intended just as much for the jury as it was to convince Judge Warren Wilbert that evidence existed to support a possible conviction of voluntary manslaughter. A conviction on the lesser offense, which is defined as ""an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force,"" would have set Roeder free from prison after five years. Earlier in the trial, Wilbert said he would rule after hearing evidence in the case, acknowledging that he felt the defense faced ""an uphill battle."" Ultimately, he rejected the theory, saying testimony did not support the defense claim that Roeder's beliefs justified using deadly force against Tiller. ""There is no imminence of danger on a Sunday morning in the back of a church, let alone any unlawful conduct, given that what Tiller did at his clinic Monday through Friday is lawful in Kansas,"" the judge said.

"Prince William's wife, Catherine, plans to give birth to their first baby in the same hospital wing where her husband was born to Diana, Princess of Wales, almost 31 years ago, sources familiar with the plans said Wednesday. The first details of the protocol surrounding the announcement of the birth were revealed as the Duchess of Cambridge enters the final weeks of her pregnancy. The baby -- which, regardless of gender, will be heir to the British throne -- is expected to arrive in mid-July. According to sources familiar with the plans, the birth will take place in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London. The first indication that the baby is on its way will be the announcement to the media that the Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources told CNN. The next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth. It will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace. There, the notice will be placed on an easel on the palace forecourt, the royal sources said. This will be the first chance for the nation and those watching around the world to find out whether the new baby is a boy or a girl. William and Catherine don't know the sex of their baby and want to keep the surprise until it's born, the royal sources said. William's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and other members of both families will be told of the birth before the public knows. The next announcement will be that the Duchess of Cambridge and her baby are to be discharged from the hospital. People are already laying bets on what the newest member of the royal family will be named. Alexandra appears to be the favorite for a girl, with George the favored name for a boy, according to UK betting websites. Diana, Elizabeth and Victoria are also popular choices with punters. The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William. Paternity leave . The royal couple will probably present their baby to the world on the same doorstep where a proud Diana and Prince Charles showed off William in 1982. It's not yet been disclosed where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth, the royal sources said. William, who will turn 31 on Friday, is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the Ministry of Defence, the royal sources said. He will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot. The revelation of the birth details may be cause for some anxiety, given the tragedy that followed Catherine's hospitalization late last year for acute morning sickness. In that instance, a prank call by an Australian radio station to nursing staff at King Edward VII's Hospital, which sparked a media frenzy after details of Catherine's care were revealed, resulted in a nurse's suicide. ""We would appeal to all members of the media for an appropriate degree of sensitivity, dignity and privacy in their reporting,"" a royal source said. ""With the events of the King Edward Hospital still strong in our memories, we would expect any media covering the Duchess of Cambridge's hospitalization to ensure that the normal functions of the hospital are not impeded by any media presence."" Champagne on ice? According to the Lindo Wing website, it has been offering private obstetric and neonatal care for mothers and babies since 1937. The private wing operates alongside the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which is part of the National Health Service. ""Over the years, we have gained an international reputation for clinical excellence in both obstetric and neonatal medicine which has made us the choice for thousands of mothers. But what really sets us apart is the discreet, traditional, individualised service we provide,"" the Lindo Wing's online brochure says. According to the prices listed, a stay in the Lindo Wing doesn't come cheap by comparison with National Health Service care, which is free at the point of delivery. However, the mother can stay in a room with its own bath or private suite, with a range of facilities and services offered. Among them is ""a comprehensive wine list should you wish to enjoy a glass of champagne and toast your baby's arrival."" The care package for the first 24 hours with a normal delivery starts at £4,965 ($7,777), with the price increasing for a larger room or suite, or if a forceps delivery or caesarean section is needed.  An additional night's stay costs £900 ($1,400) or more on top of that price. Pregnant Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, names cruise ship .

"With vast expanses of sparkling blue ocean, remote dive sites teeming with marine life and thousands of uninhabited tropical islands ripe for exploration, Southeast Asia is home to some of the world's finest adventure sailing spots. It's apt then that luxury boating manufacturers will this weekend drop anchor in Singapore, one of the continent's most vibrant  harbor cities, to take part in the 20th annual Boat Asia show. Specialist shipbuilders display the latest yachts, speedboats and ocean-going gadgets during the four-day jamboree. With this spirit of maritime adventure in mind, CNN asked Herman Ho, Boat Asia 2012 managing director, and Stuart McDonald, founder and editor of Asian travel website, travelfish.org, to give the lowdown on Southeast Asia's most spectacular coastal spots. Anambas islands, Indonesia . Situated 200 nautical miles east of Batam Island in northeastern Indonesia, the Anambas islands are a must for snorkeling and diving enthusiasts, says Herman Ho. See also: China's super rich set sights on superyachts . Pulau Bawah, the main island in the Anambas chain is uninhabited and offers ""a naturally protected lagoon with beautiful clear blue waters and corals,"" enthuses Ho. Further inland there is a giant waterfall that offers a great secluded picnic spot. Shipwrecked vessels ""Seven Skies"" and ""Igara"" have become a magnet for a wide variety of indigenous marine life and offer the perfect opportunity for a dip. What's more, he says, they are so remote that if you make the effort to go, you are likely to have them all to yourself. Koh Chang, Thailand . Located near Thailand's maritime border with Cambodia, the Koh Chang archipelago offers a wealth of secluded tropical islands that are perfect for exploration by sea, says Stuart McDonald. Hundreds of deserted beaches enable land lovers to get their feet sandy while the shallow waters near shore provide fantastic snorkeling opportunities. See also: South Korea, World's next sailing giant? ""Though the diving here isn't the region's best,"" says McDonald, there is still so much spectacular marine life that getting into the water will always be a treat. McDonald warns however that Koh Chang can get extremely wet during the rainy season -- which usually occurs between June and October -- and advises all mariners to check the weather outlook before setting sail. Langkawi, Malaysia . Blessed with gorgeous sandy beaches and some of Southeast Asia's most fertile fishing grounds, the waters of Langkawi Island straddle the maritime border between Malaysia and Thailand. Like its Thai island neighbor, Phuket, Langkawi has numerous marinas that cater for guests cruising the surrounding Malacca Strait. Casting anchor and setting foot on the islands themselves offers a great opportunity to scale one of the region's most spectacular vantage points, says Ho. Vistors can just hop on a cable car to the peak of Gunung Mat Chinchang mountain, some 2,300 feet above sea level, where they can take in the wonderful views. Halong Bay, Vietnam . Halong Bay in northwestern Vietnam is one of the most stunning boating destinations anywhere in the world, says McDonald. Comprising a vast coastal waterway of roughly 2,000 islands spread over an area of 1,500 square kilometers, carving out your own sailing space shouldn't be too much of a problem. While tranquil waters year round make sure going for a swim is always a pleasure . See also: Secret life of Hong Kong's island hideaways . The mysterious limestone caves on Halong Bay's bigger islands and the ""incredible sunsets"" meanwhile are two sights not to be missed, advises McDonald. Similan Islands, Thailand . The Similan islands are a group of nine small archipelagos that have been designated a marine nature reserve by the Thai government. Situated off the country's west coast in the Andaman Sea, the spectacular islets are a nationally protected wildlife area, says Ho. Sailing around the Similans is still allowed, though, and those who venture there are treated with ""turquoise blue waters full of marine life,"" says Ho. There are also hundreds of varieties of fish and turtles surrounding the islands, he adds, while peace and quiet is virtually guaranteed.","The 20th annual Asia Boat Show will take place in Singapore this weekend .

"I used to be able to justify using Facebook as a cost of doing business. As a writer and sometime activist who needs to promote my books and articles and occasionally rally people to one cause or another, I found Facebook fast and convenient. Though I never really used it to socialize, I figured it was OK to let other people do that, and I benefited from their behavior. I can no longer justify this arrangement. Today, I am surrendering my Facebook account, because my participation on the site is simply too inconsistent with the values I espouse in my work. In my upcoming book ""Present Shock,"" I chronicle some of what happens when we can no longer manage our many online presences. I have always argued for engaging with technology as conscious human beings and dispensing with technologies that take that agency away. Facebook is just such a technology. It does things on our behalf when we're not even there. It actively misrepresents us to our friends, and worse misrepresents those who have befriended us to still others. To enable this dysfunctional situation -- I call it ""digiphrenia"" -- would be at the very least hypocritical. But to participate on Facebook as an author, in a way specifically intended to draw out the ""likes"" and resulting vulnerability of others, is untenable. Facebook has never been merely a social platform. Rather, it exploits our social interactions the way a Tupperware party does. Facebook does not exist to help us make friends, but to turn our network of connections, brand preferences and activities over time --  our ""social graphs"" -- into money for others. We Facebook users have been building a treasure lode of big data that government and corporate researchers have been mining to predict and influence what we buy and for whom we vote. We have been handing over to them vast quantities of information about ourselves and our friends, loved ones and acquaintances. With this information, Facebook and the ""big data"" research firms purchasing their data predict still more things about us -- from our future product purchases or sexual orientation to our likelihood for civil disobedience or even terrorism. The true end users of Facebook are the marketers who want to reach and influence us. They are Facebook's paying customers; we are the product. And we are its workers. The countless hours that we -- and the young, particularly -- spend on our profiles are the unpaid labor on which Facebook justifies its stock valuation. The efforts of a few thousand employees at Facebook's Menlo Park campus pale in comparison to those of the hundreds of millions of users meticulously tweaking their pages. Corporations used to have to do research to assemble our consumer profiles; now we do it for them. The information collected about you by Facebook through my Facebook page isn't even shared with me. Thanks to my page, Facebook knows the demographics of my readership, their e-mails, what else they like, who else they know and, perhaps most significant, who they trust. And Facebook is taking pains not to share any of this, going so far as to limit the ability of third-party applications to utilize any of this data. Given that this was the foundation for Facebook's business plan from the start, perhaps more recent developments in the company's ever-evolving user agreement shouldn't have been so disheartening. Still, we bridle at the notion that any of our updates might be converted into ""sponsored stories"" by whatever business or brand we may have mentioned. That innocent mention of cup of coffee at Starbucks, in the Facebook universe, quickly becomes an attributed endorsement of their brand. Remember, the only way to connect with something or someone is to ""like"" them. This means if you want to find out what a politician or company you don't like is up to, you still have to endorse them publicly. More recently, users -- particularly those with larger sets of friends, followers and likes -- learned that their updates were no longer reaching all of the people who had signed up to get them. Now, we are supposed to pay to ""promote"" our posts to our friends and, if we pay even more, to their friends. Yes, Facebook is entitled to be paid for promoting us and our interests -- but this wasn't the deal going in, particularly not for companies who paid Facebook for extra followers in the first place. Neither should users who ""friend"" my page automatically become the passive conduits for any of my messages to all their friends just because I paid for it. That brings me to Facebook's most recent shift, and the one that pushed me over the edge. Through a new variation of the Sponsored Stories feature called Related Posts, users who ""like"" something can be unwittingly associated with pretty much anything an advertiser pays for. Like e-mail spam with a spoofed identity, the Related Post shows up in a newsfeed right under the user's name and picture. If you like me, you can be shown implicitly recommending me or something I like -- something you've never heard of -- to others without your consent. For now, as long as I don't like anything myself, I have some measure of control over what those who follow me receive in my name or, worse, are made to appear to be endorsing, themselves. But I feel that control slipping away, and cannot remain part of a system where liking me or my work can be used against you. The promotional leverage that Facebook affords me is not worth the price. Besides, how can I ask you to like me, when I myself must refuse to like you or anything else? I have always appreciated that agreeing to become publicly linked to me and my work online involves trust. It is a trust I value, but -- as it is dependent on the good graces of Facebook -- it is a trust I can live up to only by unfriending this particularly anti-social social network. Maybe in doing so I'll help people remember that Facebook is not the Internet. It's just one website, and it comes with a price.","Douglas Rushkoff: Facebook has been very useful to him but now goes too far .

"Michael Dunn killed Jordan Davis. That's not in dispute, but according to attorneys' opening statements Thursday in Dunn's murder trial, almost everything else is. Assistant State Attorney John Guy, speaking for the prosecution, painted a picture of four innocent teens who stopped at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station for gum and cigarettes amid a day of ""mall hopping and girl shopping"" over  Thanksgiving break in 2012. Dunn asked the teens to turn down their music, and Jordan disrespected him, saying ""F*** that n****r"" -- nothing more -- and for that, Dunn opened fire, hitting Jordan three times. It was a markedly different account from that of defense attorney Cory Strolla, who told jurors that the music was so loud, it was rattling the windows of the teens' SUV, and when Dunn politely asked one of them to turn it down, Jordan uttered the three-word explicit phrase, demanded his pal turn the music back up and began jawing with Dunn. Jordan then produced a weapon -- either a gun or a lead pipe, Strolla alleged -- and told Dunn, ""I'm going to f***ing kill you,"" the attorney said. He added, ""You're dead, bitch. This is going down now,"" the attorney alleged. While Guy said Jordan and Dunn ""exchanged f-bombs back and forth,"" Strolla said his client never uttered a curse word. And while Guy cited witnesses who said an incensed Dunn began shooting after telling Jordan, ""You're not going to talk to me like that,"" Strolla insisted that Jordan was getting out of the car, armed, with the intention of hurting or killing Dunn. ""The first person to get upset, and the only person to curse was Jordan Davis,"" Strolla said, adding that one of the teens with Jordan, Leland Brunson, initially told police Jordan was getting out of the car when the shots rang out. Four days later, Strolla said, the teens claimed driver Tommie Stornes had the child locks activated, preventing Jordan from getting out. ""You know why he didn't duck? He was getting out of the car with a weapon,"" Strolla said. The shooting . Dunn initially fired three times into Jordan's door, which Guy said was closed, a bullet landing in each of Jordan's legs while a third bullet traveled through his liver, lungs and aorta. A ""terrified"" Stornes backed up, ""but the defendant didn't stop. He kept focus and aimed at the car,"" firing four more times, Guy said. Dunn then opened the door of his Volkswagen, swung his legs out of the car and fired three more times, the prosecutor said. One bullet went through the back window of Stornes' Dodge Durango and landed in the visor just above his head, Guy said. Police reports have indicated that the teens were unarmed, and a police interrogator told Dunn the day after the November 2012 shooting that the teens didn't have a chance to ditch any weapon because they never left the gas station parking lot. Dunn repeatedly said he feared for his life and saw either a shotgun barrel or a stick in the teens' SUV before he began shooting. When police searched the car, Guy said, they found a basketball, basketball shoes, some clothing, a camera tripod and cups on the floor but ""no weapons."" This promises to be a bone of contention in the case, as Strolla told jurors that not only did the teens leave the gas station parking lot, they stopped in an adjacent lot about 100 yards away before returning and asking someone to call 911. They had ""ample time to get rid of a firearm or pipe,"" Strolla said. Also, Strolla said, the witnesses cannot account for two of the teens' whereabouts immediately after the shooting, and two witnesses initially told police the teens appeared to be ""stashing"" something. No weapon was found because the police did not secure the parking lot to conduct a proper search, Strolla said, and it was days before authorities looked in the nearby bushes and Dumpsters. Though it doesn't appear to be a factor in the case, Jordan did have a knife in his pocket. Guy classified it as a ""pocket knife,"" a description with which Strolla took issue, saying it was a tactical knife with a 4-inch blade. ""It's not a Swiss Army knife with a toothpick and scissors,"" he said. The aftermath . What happened immediately after the shooting is also arguable, to hear the attorneys tell it. Dunn and his girlfriend, Rhonda Rouer, drove 40 miles south to St. Augustine, where they had reservations at a bed and breakfast. Once there, Guy said, Dunn ordered pizza, ""took his little dog for a walk,"" ordered a movie and ""poured a big, tall drink -- rum and Coke."" ""They had cell phones, but they didn't call 911. He didn't drive to a police substation,"" Guy said. ""That defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep."" In the morning, Rouer saw a news report about a shooting at a Jacksonville gas station, in which a 17-year-old had been killed, and rather than call police, the couple packed their bags and drove 130 miles home to Satellite Beach, where Dunn was finally apprehended. Dunn ""was waiting till we get around people we know"" to call authorities, and he wanted to ensure ""our dog and everybody were where they needed to be. I did not want to bring a s**tstorm down on them in Jacksonville,"" he told interrogators the day after the shooting. Strolla added that it wasn't Dunn who ordered pizza, but Rouer, who was nervous meeting Dunn's family for the first time that day. She hadn't eaten much at Dunn's son's wedding and ordered the pizza because she was hungry, Strolla said. ""She's the one who watched the movie to put herself to sleep,"" the defense attorney said. Rouer is also to blame for the couple traveling home the next morning, he said. She was ""petrified"" and ""didn't know the law of self-defense"" and begged Dunn to take her back to Satellite Beach, Strolla said. He said, she said . Witness credibility promises to be an issue as well, as the driver of teens' car, Stornes, was on probation and violating curfew at the time of the shooting. Also, Strolla said, the witness who reported Dunn's license plate to police is in prison and tried to leverage his testimony in Dunn's trial for a lighter sentence. Dunn has pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder. Between iffy witnesses and what Strolla called a shoddy investigation, the evidence will show that Dunn's actions were lawful and justified, the defense attorney said. Had Dunn not been armed, he might have been the victim that evening, Strolla said. ""God didn't make all men equal. Colt did. Colt is a firearm,"" Strolla said. ""(Dunn) had every right under the law to not be a victim, to be judged by 12 rather than carried by six."" The prosecution unsurprisingly has a different take. Guy said Dunn was simply incensed by the heavy bass coming from a nearby car -- even telling Rouer before she went to buy wine and chips, ""I hate this music"" -- and he began shooting when a teen defiantly took issue with being told what to do. ""Jordan Davis was sitting in his car seat with the door closed with nothing in his hands,"" Guy told the jury. ""Michael David Dunn pointed a semiautomatic pistol at four unarmed kids at a distance much closer than you and I."" John Phillips, an attorney for the Davis family, told CNN he expects a quick trial, over before February 14, two days before what would have been Davis' 19th birthday.","Opening statements paint starkly different pictures of what led to Jordan Davis' killing .

"When police caught up with alleged killer Eddie Ray Routh last weekend, the 25-year-old ex-Marine was crying, shirtless, shoeless and smelling of alcohol. ""I'm hurting,"" he told them. Not long before, at a Texas shooting range, police say, Routh had gunned down Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL who called himself America's deadliest military sniper. As he sits in a Texas jail cell, details about Routh's psychological make-up have surfaced, including claims that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition that affects a number of current and former members of the U.S. military. Of course, combat duty doesn't automatically lead to PTSD. And it's not even clear that Routh served in a combat zone during his four years in the Marines. Nonetheless, Kyle's tragic death and Routh's story are shining light on those who suffer from PTSD and the circumstances that surround it. Here are five things to know about PTSD: . What is it? Anyone who has experienced a life-threatening situation can develop PTSD, according to Dr. Stephen J. Cozza, a professor of psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. A sufferer typically re-experiences the trauma through flashbacks and nightmares, experiences that can seem as real as the actual trauma. The person often feels intensely that the trauma could happen again at any time. How common is it for someone to be diagnosed with PTSD? While many people will have extremely distressing or threatening experiences in their lifetimes, only a small percentage will experience PTSD, experts say. In the general population about 7% of people experience PTSD, and there is a 60% chance of at-risk individuals -- combat veterans, victims of natural disasters or victims of violent crime -- experiencing PTSD, experts estimate. Thirty percent of service members who have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan have been diagnosed with PTSD, according to a Department of Veterans Affairs study released last year. ""We need to remember that while substantial numbers of vets have mental health conditions,"" Cozza said, the majority do not. ""We don't want to stigmatize our vets, because many of them are not ill,"" he said. ""As an organization and as a community, the military has varying levels of health and risk. There are more services for mental health care in the military than there has ever been before."" How virtual reality can combat veterans' PTSD . Could PTSD lead someone to act violently? There's no way to answer that definitively, experts say. But new research is being conducted. Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who struggle with anger are twice as likely as other vets to be arrested for crimes, according to the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, which published a study last year. The study, conducted by the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine, examined 1,388 combat veterans. Researchers found that about 23% of those with PTSD and high irritability had been arrested for criminal offenses. But researchers also found that other factors unrelated to military service -- including growing up around violence or drug abuse -- were factors behind why some vets committed crimes. Is there a way to treat PTSD that reduces the chances that a sufferer will act out? Exposure therapy often helps the person with PTSD revisit or re-experience their trauma as a means of lessening the effect the memory has on them, said Dr. Albert ""Skip"" Rizzo, a psychiatrist who works with the military and has pioneered use of virtual reality for treating PTSD. Rizzo, who is with the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California. This kind of therapy has been around for years. Typically a therapist would ask someone to imagine they are experiencing their trauma again. This would happen repeatedly, and ideally, with each retelling of what happened, the event would seem gradually less threatening. Recently Rizzo and other experts have employed virtual reality for this purpose. Patients wear goggles and describe their experiences while a technician stands by with a console changing the scene to fit the patient's description. If the patient recalls hearing a young boy's voice, the technician makes that happen. If the patient experienced the trauma at night or in the daytime, or perhaps was involved in an IED explosion, those circumstances will be created in the virtual world. ""We can begin to pace the exposure in a very evocative fashion,"" Rizzo said. ""This works because some people don't engage in the trauma memory at a sufficient level. They don't engage fully with their imagination to confront difficult memories."" Treating PTSD with Ecstasy: One story . Could a gun range be a form of exposure therapy? Absolutely not, Rizzo said. ""What happened this weekend with the death of former Navy Seal sniper Chris Kyle at a gun range is exactly the opposite of the evidence-based approach to treating PTSD,"" termed 'prolonged exposure' or 'virtual reality exposure' therapy, he said. ""Chris Kyle, while well trained in his field, had no clinical training in conducting therapeutic exposure."" It is never advisable to put someone with PTSD in an environment where there is likely to be uncontrolled exposure to provocative events -- such as gunfire and visuals of people shooting guns -- because this could stoke a flashback in the PTSD sufferer. ""This would especially not be recommended in a situation where that person had a gun in his/her hand or at least quick access to one. That would truly be a questionable activity, and in this case, it was a deadly one,"" Rizzo wrote in an e-mail forum to journalists who were asking him about the Kyle case. Conducting exposure therapy requires a well-trained expert clinician in a very controlled therapeutic setting, Rizzo said. ""That is very different than what one could ever reasonably expect in the atmosphere of a shooting range,"" he said.","PTSD is marked by hyper-vigilance, a fear that a trauma will occur again .
Rates of PTSD among the general population are low .
Virtual reality is being used to treat PTSD sufferers ."
"A beached 30-foot sperm whale near Tampa, Florida, attracted hundreds of onlookers Thursday afternoon as biologist decided to euthanize the animal, according to CNN affiliate WTSP. Sperm whales are rarely seen close to shore, and this whale appeared to be emaciated, according to biologists. Because the large whale wouldn't have been able to survive on its own, veterinarians from the University of Florida decided to euthanize it. They gave the whale a strong sedative before administering a drug by plunging a 6-foot needle into the whale's chest cavity to stop its heart. ""Although it looks large and scary, it is a very humane thing to do,"" said Erin Fougeres, a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. She added the technique has been used many times before on large whales. The whale carcass was towed away, and scientists plan a necropsy on Friday.","A 30-foot sperm whale beached itself near Tampa, Florida .

"[Breaking news update, Saturday, 12:54 a.m. ET] . The number of power outages that occurred across 16 states and the District of Columbia during the latest winter storm dropped to 525,273 early Friday from a previous 625,000 late Thursday. [Originally published story, Friday, 9:55 a.m. ET] . Massive winter storm taking toll in power outages, canceled flights -- and lives . (CNN) -- Enough already. Really. As if the East Coast hadn't gotten the point by now, Mother Nature drove it home yet again -- that this is winter, hear it roar. Roar it did Thursday, as a massive storm system that just finished pummeling much of the Southeast moved northward. Some of what fell from the sky was rain, some was sleet, some was snow. Whatever it was, it made for a mess. Fast-falling snow caused tractor-trailers to jackknife and prompted authorities in New York to ban commercial traffic on Interstate 84 -- a major east-west highway running through the state -- the state transportation department tweeted. As of 9:30 p.m., the New York metro area was already buried: The National Weather Service reported up to 11 inches in the Bronx, 14 inches in Fairfield, Connecticut, and even more than that in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home to the recent Super Bowl. And it's not like the end is near. Another round is expected to wallop the same area overnight, coming down 1 to 3 inches an hour  at times. And Massachusetts' Berkshires could see 14 to 24 inches of snow before the storm runs its course. For some, the issue isn't just the fact that there's snow: This is winter, after all, in the Northeast. But it's more that people there haven't gotten much of a reprieve. That's why New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, opening up his press conference Thursday, said: ""Welcome to winter storm six of the last six weeks."" And as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie pointed out before the worst of the storm hit: ""This has just been a brutal winter where it never really has gotten warmer. And so the natural melting away of snow and ice is not happening."" Especially over its full course, this storm has proven to be nothing to mess with. At least 16 deaths have been blamed on the storm. Three of them were in Howard County, Maryland, where three men -- ages 45, 55 and 57 -- suffered suspected cardiac arrest ""while in the act of shoveling snow,"" said county spokesman Mark Miller, who noted that what fell there was ""a heavy wet snow."" There were also three deaths apiece in Texas and North Carolina, including one in a rural part of the latter due to a falling tree limb. And in the New York borough of Brooklyn, a 36-year-old pregnant woman died after being struck by a small tractor clearing snow. Her nearly full-term baby was delivered by cesarean section at a hospital and was in critical condition. Amid such tragedy, even as people hunker down or cope without electricity, life has gone on, too. Augusta Kalsky documented the snowy, icy, windy morass Thursday for CNN iReport, calling this system ""one of the more aggressive Nor'easters"" she's seen since returning to Manhattan four years ago. At the same time, she added, ""The usual drivers and pedestrians (are) attempting to go about their business as usual."" Power outages; about 6,500 flights canceled . There was nothing usual about Thursday for Aretha Williams. The Fairburn, Georgia, woman's power went out at 6 a.m. Wednesday -- her birthday, of all days. And 34 hours later, it was still out. Over that time, she and her teenage daughter took turns going back and forth to their car to get warmed up by the engine and heater, and charge their phones. When they tried to contact the local utility, Williams says, the calls went straight to voice mail -- leaving her with no idea when her lights and heat would come back on. ""We are just frustrated,"" Williams said late Thursday afternoon, hours after first alerting CNN iReport to her ordeal. Venturing out on the still slippery roads, Williams and her daughter did manage to buy lunch but couldn't find any available firewood. That's one reason why she's strongly considering trying to find somewhere warm to spend the night. As she said, ""It's too cold. I can't go through this another night with my daughter."" Unfortunately, Williams has plenty of company in being in the dark. Some 625,000 customers -- more than half of whom were in North and South Carolina -- were without power up and down the East Coast as of 6:45 p.m. One positive was that number was down about 75,000 from a few hours earlier, indicating utilities were making progress. Many others have other kinds of headaches, like would-be air travelers. FlightAware, an air travel tracking website, reported around 8 p.m. Thursday that nearly 6,500 flights originating in or destined for the United States had been canceled. Charlotte's airport in North Carolina was among the most impacted. Still, there are few along the East Coast -- from Atlanta to Washington to Philadelphia to Boston -- that haven't had their schedules turned upside down, yet again, by this winter storm. And rail travel hasn't been immune.  Amtrak has suspended some service in the Northeast, South and Mid-Atlantic regions again for Thursday. East Coast travelers brave another nasty day . N.C. governor: 'Some people didn't take my warning' In and around Atlanta, the storm could have been worse. For proof, all Georgians had to do was think back two weeks ago -- when motorists ditched hundreds of cars along roads, students had to camp out overnight in school and some spent upwards of 20 hours stuck on impassable roads. This time around, the state seemed to have learned its lesson. A combination of snow, ice and rain slammed Georgia, leading to widespread power outages. But this time, at least, people stayed off the roads. It seemed like deja vu, though, for a time in North Carolina. There, the snow showed up fast and furious in the middle of the day on Wednesday. And when motorists hit the road, many got stuck  -- with some of them even leaving their vehicles in the road and walking away altogether. Yet Gov. Patrick McCrory, speaking Thursday to CNN, resisted comparing what happened in his state to what had happened earlier in Georgia. He pointed out that he'd declared a state of emergency and began warning people ""don't put your stupid hat on"" well ahead of the storm. ""Some people didn't take my warning,"" McCrory said. There were drivers who spent four to five hours in gridlock traffic but none were on the road overnight, added the governor. And by Thursday, when round two of the storm rolled through, much of the state was quiet as people hunkered down inside. Rather than pin it on officials or citizens, McCrory suggested that the uniquely large, powerful, fast-moving storm deserved the blame for it all -- the traffic jams, the widespread blackouts, and the deadly dangerous conditions outside. In North Carolina alone, the storm was hitting in full force in five different metropolitan areas at the same time. ""We have not seen a storm like this in decades,"" the governor said.

"Spc. Ivan Lopez, who ended his life after killing three people at the Fort Hood, Texas, military base Wednesday, was undergoing diagnostic procedures for post-traumatic stress disorder, according to Lt. Gen Mark Milley, Fort Hood's commanding general. He was also receiving a variety of treatments for conditions including depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances, Army Secretary John McHugh told the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday. Lopez did not receive a diagnosis of PTSD, but the incident puts the condition in the spotlight. A big challenge in helping veterans with PTSD is the amount of time that passes before a diagnosis, which can be three to four months, said Terry Lyles, a stress coach in Miami who has worked with PTSD patients and is a civilian contractor with the Department of Defense. In the general population, PTSD is diagnosed right away, but in the military there are bureaucratic holdups before a diagnosis is officially given, he said. ""The system itself gets bogged down."" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that more needs to be done to support military veterans and their families. ""We need to be very mindful in this country that even as those wars end, what we owe our veterans does not end,"" he said. Here are facts you should know about PTSD: . Fort Hood shooter was Iraq vet being treated for mental health issues . 1. What is PSTD? It's natural to experience fear in dangerous situations. But people with PTSD may behave as though they are under attack when there is no real imminent threat. A person who suffers PTSD typically re-experiences the trauma through flashbacks and nightmares, experiences that can seem as real as the actual trauma. The person often feels intensely that the trauma could happen again at any time. Thoughts and feelings can trigger symptoms, but so can words, situations or objects that remind the person of a traumatic situation. National Institutes of Health: PTSD . 2. How common is it? Anyone who has experienced a life-threatening situation can develop PTSD, according to Dr. Stephen J. Cozza, a professor of psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. Although over the course of a lifetime, many people have extremely distressing or threatening experiences, only a small percentage will experience PTSD, experts say. The range of responses is largely based on the amount of exposure to the stressor, said Cozza. Most studies examining the rate of PTSD in service members put the rates at about 15% to 20%. Thirty percent of service members who have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan have been diagnosed with PTSD, according to a Department of Veterans Affairs study. The nonprofit think-tank RAND Corporation estimates a third of veterans likely have some type of traumatic brain injury, PTSD or depression, which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000. ""We need to remember that while substantial numbers of vets have mental health conditions,"" the majority do not, Cozza said. ""We don't want to stigmatize our vets, because many of them are not ill,"" he said. ""As an organization and as a community, the military has varying levels of health and risk. There are more services for mental health care in the military than there has ever been before."" What is war's true toll? The Uncounted . 3. What causes PTSD? Experiencing any kind of trauma or dangerous event -- including seeing people harmed or killed or personally getting injured -- raises the risk for PTSD. A history of mental illness also makes PTSD more likely, as does a lack of social support after a traumatic event and enduring additional stress in its aftermath. Scientists are looking at the role of genes that are involved in the creation of fear memories. There are also neuroscientists investigating brain differences in people who have PTSD. Genes and brain structural differences may raise a person's risk for the condition without causing symptoms, according to the National Institutes of Health. The early growth of the brain may be affected by environmental factors or a history of mental illness. 3. Do other mental illnesses make it worse? Other problems such as depression and insomnia that a veteran may have had before deployment are magnified with PTSD, Lyles said. ""It does not help itself,"" he said. ""It's kind of like a pinball that gets trapped inside a machine that can't get out and just continues to ping around. You try to live your life as normal as possible but it's always present."" 4. How is it diagnosed in the military? A typical PTSD screening would be a well-structured diagnostic interview, and a few other tests, lasting about two hours, said Michael Telch, psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin. During the debriefing process from the U.S. military, returning soldiers go through an interview and other evaluations that may indicate PTSD, Lyles said. If there is reason to suspect PTSD, the veteran then goes for a full medical evaluation that involves PTSD testing. There is generally not a big lag time to make a medical diagnosis after the two-hour interview, Telch said. However, it can take months before the diagnosis is officially recognized by the military, Lyles said. Many cases of PTSD go undetected because some view the condition as a sign of weakness. Some also don't want to go through the extra battery of tests when they return home, he said. ""Many of these individuals fall through the cracks,"" Lyles said. 5. Do people with PTSD pose an increased risk of violence to themselves or others? Having PTSD does not mean that a person will be violent. But certain sounds, images and smells can trigger alarming memories to a person with the condition, and they react as if they were in the midst of war. ""Reality becomes skewed because you've been trained to be violent,"" Lyles said. ""So it's really hard to shut that out."" PTSD is not only about fear and anxiety. Patients may experience other kinds of emotional disturbances, and violence may be a way that they respond. ""Coping with strong feelings of anger, shame or guilt can be played out in terms of violent behavior,"" Telch said. Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who struggle with anger are twice as likely as other vets to be arrested for crimes, according to the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, which published a study last year. The study, conducted by the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine, examined 1,388 combat veterans. Researchers found that about 23% of those with PTSD and high irritability had been arrested for criminal offenses. But researchers also found that other factors unrelated to military service -- including growing up around violence or drug abuse -- were factors behind why some vets committed crimes. 6. Does this impact veterans' performance in the workplace, after they leave the service? Employers sometimes cite PTSD as a reason for not hiring veterans, because of public misunderstanding, former President George W. Bush said in February at the George W. Bush Library Military Service Initiative. The condition, he said, is mislabeled as a ""disorder."" ""Employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure, and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress,"" Bush said. A person who has been successful in treatment should be able to function in the workplace, Telch said. But without treatment, symptoms can be severe, and impair functioning at work, in social situations and in the family. 8. How do people with PTSD come back to normal? Exposure therapy often helps the person with PTSD revisit or re-experience their trauma as a means of lessening the effect the memory has on them, said Dr. Albert ""Skip"" Rizzo, a psychiatrist who works with the military and has pioneered use of virtual reality for treating PTSD. This kind of therapy has been around for years. Typically a therapist would ask someone to imagine they are experiencing their trauma again. This would happen repeatedly, and ideally, with each retelling of what happened, the event would seem gradually less threatening. Rizzo, who is with the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California, and other experts have employed virtual reality for this purpose. Patients wear goggles and describe their experiences while a technician stands by with a console changing the scene to fit the patient's description. If the patient recalls hearing a young boy's voice, for instance, the technician makes that happen. If the patient experienced the trauma at night or in the daytime, or perhaps was involved in an IED explosion, those circumstances will be created in the virtual world. ""We can begin to pace the exposure in a very evocative fashion,"" Rizzo said. ""This works because some people don't engage in the trauma memory at a sufficient level. They don't engage fully with their imagination to confront difficult memories."" A therapy that uses similar principles is called cognitive processing therapy. It helps patients become aware of their thoughts and feelings and learn how to deal with changes in beliefs from before and after trauma. Some patients also benefit from medication. 9. What resources are available to help service members, veterans and families? Everyone in the family of a service member with PTSD needs to be involved in the treatment plan, Lyles said. The U.S. Army Medical Department has a variety of resources on its website. These include the Real Warriors Campaign, which helps service members overcome stigma surrounding mental health treatment, and Army One Source, which helps people locate support services.

"The White House and the Justice Department made clear Friday what had been expected all along: Attorney General Eric Holder will not face criminal prosecution under the contempt of Congress citation passed by the U.S. House. Legal experts noted this week in the runup to Thursday's House vote that President Barack Obama's assertion of executive privilege in the case would prevent a criminal prosecution under a practice dating to the Reagan administration. The House also cited Holder for civil contempt to give it the option of filing a lawsuit compelling Holder to turn over documents sought by Oversight Committee investigators linked to the failed Operation Fast and Furious weapons crackdown. Such a case was expected to take years to complete. A letter Friday from the Justice Department to House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, who led the investigation that brought the contempt charge against Holder, explained that ""across administrations of both political parties, the longstanding position of the Department of Justice has been and remains that we will not prosecute"" in such a circumstance. ""The department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General,"" concluded the letter from Deputy Attorney General James Cole. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the same thing Friday, saying ""it is an established principle, dating back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, that the Justice Department does not pursue prosecution in a contempt case when the president has asserted executive privilege."" Fast and Furious investigation started with agent's death . A spokesman for Issa's committee and another top congressional Republican, veteran Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, complained Friday that the refusal to prosecute showed a lack of independence by the U.S. attorney who would handle the case. ""It is regrettable that the political leadership of the Justice Department is trying to intervene in an effort to prevent the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia from making an independent decision about whether to prosecute this case,"" said Frederick Hill, the panel's director of communications. Obama asserted executive privilege on some documents sought by Issa's committee in its investigation of Operation Fast and Furious. The executive privilege assertion prevented the documents from being turned over on the grounds that they include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes. AME Church likens Congress's Holder vote to 'evil strategies' following Reconstruction . The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. It followed similar programs started in the Bush administration. However, Fast and Furious lost track of more than 1,000 firearms it was tracking, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Issa, R-California, and Republicans contend that Holder and the Justice Department are concealing details of how Fast and Furious was approved and managed. Democrats argue that Issa and his GOP colleagues are using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting Holder and, by extension, the president in an election year. The showdown between Issa and Holder over the program dates to subpoenas issued last year by the House committee seeking a wide range of documents and other materials. Eventually, the committee reduced its demand to focus on documents involving decision-making after the Fast and Furious program was shut down. Executive privilege: A rocky legal and political road in U.S. history . In particular, the committee wanted internal documents relating to the period after February 2011, when the Justice Department sent Congress an erroneous letter -- later withdrawn -- that said top officials knew nothing about Fast and Furious until early that year. On Wednesday, Issa conceded that investigators lack any evidence that Holder knew of the failed weapons-tracking tactics of Fast and Furious. The contempt citation, he said, was for Holder's failure to comply with subpoenas seeking specific documents. ""It's not for what the attorney general knew about Fast and Furious,"" Issa said. ""It's about the attorney general's refusal to provide the documents."" Carney said Friday that Issa's comment showed the contempt citation was about politics. ""Remarkably, the chairman of the committee involved here has asserted that he has no evidence that the attorney general knew of operation Fast and Furious or did anything but take the right action when he learned of it. No evidence,"" Carney said. ""So if you have no evidence, as he's stated now about the White House and the attorney general, what else could this be than politics?""

"Editor's note: With fears of a swine flu pandemic rising daily, CNN Pentagon producer Larry Shaughnessy remembered a batch of letters from his grandfather, a World War I soldier who battled the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919. Martin ""Al"" Culhane, left, is pictured with his older brother, Frank, around 1918 or 1919. WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- ""I'm coming, I'm coming For my head is bending low I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe"" As World War I rages in Europe, fresh U.S. Army soldiers pass the time on a train ride to to Camp Forrest, Georgia. ""The boys are just starting to sing,"" Martin Aloysius Culhane wrote on September 6, 1918, to his friend back home. ""They've gotten back to 'Old Black Joe' so far."" Stephen Foster's classic song from the Civil War is about the death of slaves who had become his friends. But Culhane, known as ""Al,"" and the soldiers who sang along could not know how much death would hunt the recruits on that train, most of whom never made it to Europe to fight in the Great War. They would find themselves in the deadliest influenza pandemic in history. Culhane's letters to his older brother Frank and his long-time ""chum"" Clif Pinter are a young soldier's firsthand account of life as a draftee private and how he coped with a disease that would haunt Army camps around the United States and eventually infect people around the world. Some estimates say as many as 50 million people were killed by what's called the Spanish influenza in 1918 and 1919, far more than the number killed in combat during the war. Three weeks after the train trip to Georgia, Culhane, a 21-year-old clothing salesman from Chicago, Illinois, writes again. Already the flu occupies his thoughts.  Learn more about the current swine flu » . ""Received a nice letter from Phil Byrne he reports he is getting along fine, is feeling better than he has ever before."" Byrne, a friend from Chicago, was one of the early survivors of the Spanish flu. Other members of the Byrne family took ill a few months later, according to the letters. In the same letter he mentions how the Army was trying to protect the troops at Camp Forrest: . ""Since noon today our camp has been under quarantine to prevent an epidemic of Spanish influenza. We have had no cases thus far but it is the intention of the medical officers to prevent any case of the disease from making an appearance. All the men who have even slight colds have been put into separate barrack which, of course, were immediately christened 'the TB ward' by the rest of the company."" That same day, September 28, 1918, he wrote his brother Frank, a Navy sailor at home awaiting orders, ""Well the Spanish Influenza has made an appearance here and we are under strict orders no visits to Chattanooga, we are certainly the hard luck guys when it comes to this quarantine proposition."" At first the threat of Spanish flu is just an inconvenience for Culhane: ""I am just about fed up with staying in a district about a block square for three weeks. There is no canteen in the quarantine district and we have a hell of a time getting small supplies."" Just six days after complaining about the inconvenience, a brief but frightening note: ""Receive the enclosed letter for your information then see that Frank gets it unknown to the rest of the family."" What Culhane didn't want his mother, sister and younger brother to know was that he was in the infirmary with the Spanish flu. He asks his friend Clif to write often and encourage letters from ""my friends, without of course, telling them that I am a little under the weather."" His euphemism hid the fact that in some places more than 30 percent of people who contracted Spanish flu died. In the United States the mortality rate was lower, but still a devastating 3 percent. It was a crisis for the Army. Military bases, with thousands of men from all over the country in tightly packed barracks, were fertile breeding grounds for the flu, especially one as easily spread as this one. And unlike most flu strains that mostly strike the elderly, the very young or the sick, Spanish flu hit healthy, young adults like Army draftees. Just three days after telling his friend about being sick, Culhane wrote that he was feeling better. ""I am still in quarantine but will be released today. I am feeling great and the two day's rest has done me a world of good. I have done nothing at all but sit in the shade, read and write letters."" His recovery from the Spanish flu was swift, but the very next day, October 7, 1918, he wrote to give ""all the details of the death of a very good friend, my Bunkie, Thomas Birdie. His body will go north today, I think,"" Culhane wrote, asking Pinter to attend the wake. ""At his side, say a few prayers for the repose of his soul."" When not writing about the flu, Culhane dropped none-too-subtle hints about wanting care packages full of cookies from home. And he regularly questioned why other friends didn't write. He also worried that he was ""neglecting the ladies."" He pelts his friend Clif with questions about Ursula (""Her Majesty,"" he jokingly refers to her), Ella (the young woman to whom he promised a prized golf club) Ida (""I had a long letter from Ida Flynn. Boy! I will have a job on my hands when I get home"") and the Marys (Mary Rose, Mary English, Mary Anne). While Culhane writes about and to a lot of young ladies, there is no sign in the letters which one, if any, held a special place in his heart. Still he worried about one young man named ""Hank"" who remained in Chicago. ""Keep the ladies amused by all means, but I look to you to protect my interests. Hank is too darn nice a chap to be safe around the ladies. However, if he seems to get extra strong I will write a note and have him made Admiral of the Arctic Circle."" After recovering from the flu, Culhane bemoans the fact that war was about to end. ""It is almost over now and thirty days will see at least a cessation of hostilities. Xmas will see peace. I will never see France and as long as that is impossible I might as well be out of the Army as soon as it is over."" Nine days later, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month the war ended. And just four days after the fighting in Europe ended, the letters from Camp Forrest stopped. Al Culhane was sick again. This time he was taken to U.S. General Hospital #14 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. And he couldn't keep the latest illness a secret from his family back home in Chicago. A Catholic chaplain wrote the family that he was sick and not able to write himself. When he was well enough, he wrote Pinter, ""I don't know just what I have but it felt like old fashioned grip or perhaps 'The Flu.'"". It took about two weeks before he was out of the Fort Oglethorpe hospital and back at Camp Forrest. He had twice survived the deadliest flu in history and lived to write home about it. After his second recovery his concerns turned to getting back to Chicago by Christmas. ""Clif I have seen my discharge all written out and from that moment on my usefulness as a soldier ceased."" But again illness got in the way. This time it was a completely different one: ""Measles has broken out in our company and we are quarantined. Did you ever hear of harder luck in all your life?"" Culhane didn't make it back to Chicago for Christmas. But he eventually did return home alive and well. He never did make it to France, but traveled the United States extensively with his wife, Evelyn, a woman never mentioned in his letters home, but someone he'd known since they went through First Holy Communion together. As for Clif Pinter, who saved the letters, he and Al Culhane remained ""old chums"" for life. After Pinter's death, his son passed the letters on to Al's daughter, Dorothy Clarke, who passed them onto Al's grandchildren, including Lawrence Aloysius Shaughnessy, who works for CNN's Pentagon unit and occasionally writes stories about soldiers for CNN.com.","U.S. soldier survived Spanish flu pandemic not once, but twice .

"As Sandy took aim at the East Coast, President Barack Obama discarded campaign events in Florida and Virginia to return to Washington and address the storm from the White House. Obama visits Red Cross: 'Storm is not yet over' Mitt Romney adjusted his schedule to hit the battleground state of Ohio and direct campaign resources in Virginia and New Hampshire to focus on storm relief. Romney on storm aftermath: 'People are hurting' The candidates sought to balance the real threat of a killer storm against the need to squeeze out any last-minute advantages in battleground states ahead of next Tuesday's vote. For the next few days, routine campaigning may be put on the shelf. This week, it may all be about who can behave the most presidential. Obama was staying put in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday, while Romney attended an event in Ohio where his campaign sought goods and other help for those in states affected by the storm. Crowley: Sandy introduces big unknown into campaign . David Gergen, a professor of public service at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said Obama did the right thing by returning to the nation's capital as the storm approached. ""People will claim he did it for political reasons, but I believe he deserves the benefit of any doubts. He did exactly what he should be doing as president,"" said Gergen, who is also a CNN contributor. ""That is part of the job. Presidents are expected to lead in a time of crisis."" The candidates are treading carefully in dealing with the storm's political fallout. Both the president and Romney canceled more than a dozen campaign events since Saturday so as not to appear insensitive, chew up resources and otherwise get in the way of storm preparations. For the moment, the political optics may favor Obama, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Sandy disrupts campaigns . ""The better the response the better Obama is going to look,"" Sabato said. ""The worse the response ... the worse he's going to look. This presidential moment could help or hurt him."" Obama signed disaster declarations for New York and New Jersey, which were hit by severe flooding and wind damage, as well as other states and the District of Columbia. Virginia was the lone battleground state in Sandy's path. The White House said that Obama would remain in Washington on Wednesday as well to monitor the storm response and would not participate in campaign events scheduled for Ohio. Obama administration officials stressed they would work with states to ensure disaster aid is available for the millions affected by the storm. A White House official said Obama told officials that he wants them to think creatively about ways to help states hit by power outages affecting at least seven million people throughout the mid Atlantic region. ""I want everyone leaning forward on this. I don't want to hear that we didn't do something because bureaucracy got in the way,"" Obama said, according to the official. Obama has received briefings right along by Federal Emergency Management Agency officials and held a meeting in the White House situation room before reading a statement to reporters on Monday as the storm approached. He said it would be a ""difficult storm."" Romney also turned his attention to Sandy during a campaign event in Ohio on Monday, saying ""our hearts and prayers"" were with those in her path. ""A lot of people are going to be facing some real tough times as a result of Sandy's fury,"" Romney said in Avon Lake, Ohio. Romney called off a Monday night campaign event in Wisconsin, and sent vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in his place to another in Florida. But his continued campaigning in Ohio may not be seen as a issue. ""As long as he is in states where weather is not a problem, I don't see any problem with him campaigning,"" added Gergen, who is also the director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""He really has no role in trying to deal with this storm."" Romney's campaign late Monday night announced that an event scheduled for Tuesday in Kettering, Ohio, had been rebranded as a ""storm relief event."" ""We won't be able to solve all the problems with our effort,"" Romney told the crowd on Tuesday. ""There will still be a lot of people looking for goods even though we've gathered these things but I know that -- one of the things I've learned in life is that you make the difference you can, and you can't always solve all the problems yourself but you can make the difference in the life of one or two people as a result of one or two people making an effort."" Romney said he believed that supplies gathered at the event would be put on trucks and shipped to New Jersey where Gov. Chris Christie said on Tuesday that floodwaters had stranded hundreds of people. 5 things to watch in hurricane-wracked campaign . Obama also canceled trips to the swing states of Florida and Colorado, far beyond the reach of Hurricane Sandy. A shrewd move, political experts say. ""As voters, particularly those who are undecided, deliberate over whom they should support, they will watch Obama as he navigates through the storm and the post-storm clean-up,"" wrote Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. ""The crisis offers an opportunity for him to act presidential in a way for which some voters are thirsting and to demonstrate the kind of command that has often been lacking,"" Zelizer said. Obama's very visible posture is in stark contrast to his predecessor. President George W. Bush's administration was widely criticized for failing to act in a timely manner during Hurricane Katrina. ""Presidents for a generation or two will remember the Bush disaster with Katrina,"" Sabato said. ""Presidents and their staffs go out of their way to avoid another Katrina happening to their president."" Similarly, when Sen. John McCain rushed back to Washington in 2008 at the height of the banking meltdown, effectively ""suspending"" his presidential campaign against Obama because of the ""historic crisis in our financial system,"" the move was seen as odd and impulsive at a time when steady leadership was needed. On the other hand, Obama's handling of the financial crisis -- appearing masterful while McCain appeared confused, marked a turning point in the 2008 presidential race, political experts say. Both campaigns are keenly aware of how it looked. Romney was in a tricky position. He dialed back heavy campaigning and steered clear of pontificating on recovery efforts. ""Romney can't do anything but express concern,"" Sabato said. Experts disagree about whether the storm will ultimately have an impact on the outcome of the election. ""My sense is that it is going to be a wash,"" said Gergen, who has worked for four presidents in both parties. ""It won't change the outcome."" Asked at the White House on Monday if he was worried about the storm's impact on the election, Obama said he was concerned about those in harm's way and how Sandy might influence the economy. ""The election will take care of itself next week,"" he said.","Obama cancels campaigning through Wednesday; monitors storm response .

"(CNN) -- At least 115 people have died after a tropical storm battered Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador over the weekend, officials in those countries reported. Guatemala was hit hardest, with at least 92 deaths, 54 people missing and 59 injured, emergency officials said. Nearly 112,000 people have been evacuated and more than 29,000 are living in temporary shelters, Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said in an address to the nation late Sunday. The devastation has been widespread throughout Guatemala with mudslides destroying homes and buildings and burying some victims. At least nine rivers have dramatically higher levels and 13 bridges have collapsed, the nation's emergency services said. In the northern part of Guatemala City, the downpour created a giant sinkhole that swallowed up a space larger than the area of a street intersection. Residents told CNN that a three-story building and a house fell into the hole. A local newspaper reported that a private security guard was killed when the sinkhole opened up, but authorities had not confirmed the fatality. Residents said that a poor sewage drainage system underground was to blame for the sinkhole. A similar hole opened up nearby last year, they said. Classes have been canceled this week throughout the nation. In Honduras, where 14 people have died, President Porfirio Lobo declared a state of emergency Sunday. Nearly 3,500 people have been evacuated from their homes and nearly 3,300 are living in shelters, the Honduran emergency agency said Monday. More than 140 homes have been destroyed and another 700 have been damaged, the Permanent Commission for Emergencies reported. The situation in El Salvador, where nine people died, was improving Monday, officials said. The rain stopped Sunday afternoon and river levels were beginning to diminish, officials said. Classes nationwide remained canceled, however, until further notice. More rain was possibly forecast for Monday, though, and Salvadoran officials said they were closely monitoring the situation. Agatha was demoted from a tropical storm to a tropical depression Saturday night and lost its status as a depression Sunday evening. It was the first named storm for the Pacific hurricane season.

"If it were up to Surey Miranda, she would have never left her family in Puerto Rico.  Miranda, a college graduate, says she had little choice. ""It was a challenge to find a job in Puerto Rico,"" said Miranda, 24, who graduated from the University of Puerto Rico with a political science degree in 2012. ""Unfortunately, finding work in government can be challenging, especially since it's the island's main source of employment."" Miranda did everything she was supposed to do: She got her degree, worked as an intern in various places and even landed a part-time position with the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. Now, Miranda is one of thousands of Puerto Ricans who have left the U.S. territory in recent years in search of a better life in the U.S. mainland. Opinion:  Citizenship is a birthright in U.S. territories . In 2011 and 2012, about 55,000 residents migrated from the island to the mainland each year, according to the Census Bureau's Community Survey.  The Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics is still collecting data for those who left in 2013, but it estimates the numbers are about the same. While Puerto Ricans have migrated to the United States for several generations, the number of departures from 2000-2010 marks the largest migration wave,  at 300,000, since the 1950s, when close to a half-million migrated to the mainland during the entire decade. So many residents have left the island over the years that there are a million more Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States (4.9 million as of 2011) than in Puerto Rico (3.7 million). Why such a massive population shift in recent years? Mario Marazzi, executive director of the Puerto Rican Institute of Statistics, says it's mainly because of the 2006 recession that is still punishing the island's economy. Puerto Rico's unemployment rate is above 15%, more than double the 7.3% in the mainland, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last month, Standard & Poor's announced it had cut Puerto Rico's credit rating to junk status as the U.S. commonwealth faces $70 billion in debt, including the debt from its utility companies. Last week, in an attempt to avoid financial ruin, Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla signed a bill authorizing the sale of $3.5 million in tax-free general obligation bonds. Even if the auction is successful, the bonds are considered pretty risky. In other words, if you thought Detroit was in trouble, Puerto Rico is much worse mainly for this reason: Unlike Detroit, the island cannot file for bankruptcy court protection.  That option is only for municipalities and Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory. In 2012, a majority rejected the current status and favored statehood as an alternative, hoping that might help alleviate the territory's economic woes.  But the vote was nonbinding and never went anywhere in Washington. Puerto Ricans favor statehood for first time . For Miranda, getting a job wasn't the only factor in her decision to leave Puerto Rico. The rising cost of utilities, rent, gas and tolls were also something she needed to consider. ""Back home, I was sharing an apartment with six other students and still my expenses were taking up 70% of my salary. It was simply impossible,""  Miranda said. While the cost of living in New York City is more than double the national average, the cost of living in Puerto Rico is not the best-case scenario for a recent college graduate. For example, basic monthly utilities including electricity, heating and water cost about $246 in Puerto Rico as opposed to New York's $161. ""The cost of living all depends on where you live in Puerto Rico, because while a middle class does exist, very few fall into that category,"" said Marazzi, ""The middle class has to spend a lot more money for quality of life."" For example, two years ago many Puerto Ricans had to invest in water tanks after serious droughts sapped the water supply.  The cost of purchasing and maintaining a water tank isn't something people in the United States have to worry about, Marazzi added. Also, the electric supply isn't as reliable in Puerto Rico as it is in the United States, so Puerto Ricans have to pay more to protect their televisions and computers. ""The power goes off for a microsecond every day in Puerto Rico and electronic items don't take well to that. So, anyone with an electronic item worth having has to invest in a universal power supply, which costs about $100 here,"" Marazzi said. Puerto Ricans aren't just moving to New York, where many have typically migrated in the past.  They are also moving to Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia -- wherever there are jobs. ""Since the early 20th century, Puerto Ricans have been contributing to create what some scholars are calling 'El Nuevo South,'"" said Edwin Melendez, director of Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York.  ""With an influx of Hispanics, the south is becoming more diverse."" The latest influx of Puerto Ricans includes people primarily between ages 20 and 40, he said. ""Families and young children are migrating as well -- basically entire households are moving,"" Melendez said. While many Puerto Ricans migrating to the United States are young, educated professionals like Miranda, they also include people from across the socioeconomic spectrum, according to the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, which examines the  migration phenomenon. Opinion:  Treat U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico fairly . ""In Puerto Rico, there's a generalized perspective that there's a 'brain drain' because so many young professionals have left,"" said Melendez,  ""but they aren't the only ones leaving. ""It's also labor workers and families. We didn't find any over-representation of a certain kind of people."" Puerto Rico's education system spends close to $8,000 annually per student, according to the Department of Education.  And while that's not as high as the United States, which spends an average of $10,000 per student, it's still a significant loss for Puerto Rico, particularly as it faces a major economic crisis. Each college-educated Puerto Rican who establishes a career elsewhere is a big loss for the commonwealth, explained Puerto Rican political analyst Jay Fonseca in an interview with CNN en Español. ""Why invest so much time and money for a student in Puerto Rico only to have them leave to the U.S. and contribute to society elsewhere?"" Fonseca said. There's even an active recruiting process by U.S.-based organizations, like police departments, nurse associations and hospitals, who come to Puerto Rico to search for future employees, Marazzi said. ""They not only recruit the best bilingual candidates but they help diversify the workforce in the United States, of course to their benefit,"" said Marazzi. It's a seamless process considering all Puerto Ricans, whether born on the island territory or on the mainland, are American citizens. Marazzi added that it's not just the money that's attracting residents to leave the island. ""It's also an opportunity to work in a world class field that cares about your profession. But it is unfortunate that Puerto Rico cannot do much for the talent it produces,"" he said. Miranda said her decision to leave the island wasn't just to alleviate her current situation: She knew she would have more long-term career opportunities in New York than if she stayed in Puerto Rico. According to Melendez, the likelihood that Miranda will return to Puerto Rico is slim, because so many Puerto Ricans who migrate to the mainland settle down and stay. Yet Miranda said she hasn't given up on her goal to improve things back home. ""Seeing the way New York City operates makes you notice what Puerto Rico lacks and makes me want to go back and do things a different way,"" Miranda said. ""But it does not depend on us, it depends whether Puerto Rico's government will allow us to contribute in the reconstruction of our country.""","Puerto Rican college graduate shares her story on why she left the island .

"A well known leader of an anti-government ""sovereign citizens"" group was indicted Tuesday in Montgomery, Alabama, for tax crimes, the Justice Department announced. A 10-count indictment charges James Timothy Turner with conspiracy to defraud the United States, attempting to pay taxes with fictitious financial instruments, attempting to obstruct the Internal Revenue Service, failure to file federal tax returns and giving false testimony in a bankruptcy proceeding. The government says Turner, the self-proclaimed president of a sovereign-citizens group called Republic for the united States of America, was arrested Tuesday and had a brief court appearance.   Turner will remain in jail pending a Monday detention hearing, according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Alabama. According to the indictment, Turner allegedly tried to pay his 2008 taxes with a $300 million fake bond and assisted others trying to pay taxes with up to $100 billion dollars in fraudulent bonds. Prosecutors also said Turner gave seminars teaching others how to defraud the IRS and to file retaliatory liens against government officials. Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center said Turner's sovereign citizens group rejects the authority of the government and its ability to enforce laws and collect taxes. Potok said that in late 2010 the group sent letters to governors in all 50 states calling on them to step down. The taxes charges brought against Turner carry a maximum of 164 years in prison as well as large financial penalties if he is convicted. CNN was not able to identify a lawyer representing Turner.","The defendant heads a group that calls itself the Republic for the united States of America .

"A strong U.S. military is indispensable to our national security. As retired military officers, we have dedicated our careers, on active duty and retired, to that end. We have been involved in crafting and teaching national security strategy, of which military strategy and use of military force are vital components. In the debate over the Pentagon budget and with threats of deeper cuts coming, the president, Congress, governors and the entire defense community are rightly concerned about sequestration, which cuts both domestic and defense spending indiscriminately. It is agreed that overall spending reductions are necessary, but the ""fiscal cliff"" crisis reflects a lack of political will, not rational planning. Too often, the Pentagon spending debate is ensnared in the outmoded ideology of past wars and driven by legions of lobbyists for parochial interests in the military-industrial complex. America's power is more than a massive force structure and numbers of ships, tanks and planes. A national security strategy must be based on current and future threats, not past war doctrines. In 2008, a National Intelligence Estimate declared the economic crisis, not terrorism, as the greatest threat to national security. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm. Mike Mullin, along with other senior military leaders, endorsed that assessment. Zakaria: Will we get big fiscal deal, or small? It is doubtful that future threats will call for many of the expensive weapon systems advocated by parochial interests and some political leaders -- a system such as the F-35 joint strike fighter. Developing this plane has cost more than was spent on veterans in the last 20 years. Today, the use of manned aircraft is more and more limited. Our leaders must have a serious debate about priorities: America needs political resolve to kill unnecessary and expensive projects. Our nuclear weapons policy is based on Cold War conditions that no longer exist. The Pentagon is expected to spend more than $700 billion on nuclear weapons over the next 10 years, for little added security. The former U.S. Strategic Command Chief Gen. James Cartwright has called for a drastic cut in nuclear weapons, saying the U.S. has a stockpile ""beyond our needs. What is it we're really trying to deter? Our current arsenal does not address the threats of the 21st century."" The program is based more on ideology than security. Sadly, defense spending is driven by political interests, not necessity. In his 1986 book ""The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,"" Paul Kennedy argues that great powers fall by bankrupting themselves to rule extensive empires. After the invasion of Iraq, Kennedy published an op-ed, ""Perils of Empire,"" suggesting America may furnish material for another chapter. In the last decade, America fought two expensive wars and Congress has yet to pay for them; that policy has contributed to our precarious economic position. Sequestration is not an effective means of excising wasteful Pentagon spending; it is the result of political gridlock and special interest intransigence. As Congress attempts to undo its own mess and prevent sequestration, the Pentagon budget needs to be on the table. Reducing wasteful spending on unneeded programs and outdated strategy will save money and enhance national security. The political argument that cutting defense spending will cost jobs is spurious. Pentagon spending purchases one item and does not provide greater economic benefits. The F-35 program is slated to cost $1.5 trillion over its lifetime; these are resources that are desperately needed elsewhere or could pay down the national debt. After more than a decade of wars of dubious value, America will receive a greater return on investment by investing in our troops and veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Every dollar wasted on unnecessary programs could be caring for and training our servicemen and women. Instead of building new toys that are kept in the garage, let's provide education and job training to veterans. Recent congressional refusal to approve such a jobs program is a disgrace. Cutting Pentagon spending recognizes that national security is more than military power. The United States is stronger with a strong economy, sustainable jobs, investment in education, renewal of our infrastructure and a sensible energy strategy. Continuing to waste money when our nation should have other priorities is bad policy and bad for security.","Writers: Pentagon spending is based on strategies from old ideology and driven by lobbyists .

"The past week has been a devastating one for many families. Zubeidat Tsarnaev's is one of them. But the mother of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings remains resolute in her belief that her sons were not involved in the attack. She told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in Makhachkala, Dagestan, that she believes the tragedy that killed three people and injured dozens more was staged and that the bombing was fake. Boston bombing suspects: The Dagestan connection . Zubeidat Tsarnaev has seen a video supporting the idea that it was ""something like a really big play,"" she said, with ""paint instead of blood like it is made-up."" Does she really believe that? ""That's what I want to know, because everybody's talking about it: that this is a show, that's what I want to know. That's what I want to understand,"" replied Tsarnaev. Paton Walsh asked whether she had seen the news images of the actual bombings and the suffering they caused. ""I haven't,"" she answered. But her disbelief wavered when she spoke of the victims. Suspects' mother says bombing was staged with paint instead of blood . ""I really feel sorry for all of them. Really feel sorry for all of them,"" she said, her voice cracking. But she is convinced that her sons, Dzhokhar, 19, and Tamerlan, 26, were not involved. ""There is something wrong,"" she said as she sought to articulate her confusion. The elder son was killed after the two allegedly violently resisted and fled police. Tamerlan's body remains unclaimed. Dzhokhar is hospitalized with severe injuries and faces terrorism and murder charges. His mother said at a news conference Thursday that authorities ""already told us they will not let us see Dzhokhar."" 'I have nothing' She broke down in sobs as she tried to describe her torment as a ""loving mother of two kids"" faced with the events of the past week. ""This is really crazy. I can't even, I can't even describe it,"" she told Paton Walsh, looking drained. ""I have no strength. I have nothing. I have no sleep. I am just like dead.  Like a dead person."" Her husband, Anzor Tsarnaev, said Thursday that he expected to fly soon from Dagestan to the United States. But those plans may be in limbo after Zubeidat Tsarnaev said she'd called an ambulance Thursday to take her husband to a hospital in Makhachkala. It was not immediately known whether Anzor Tsarnaev was ever admitted to a hospital and, if so, if he is still there. If he ever makes it to the United States, his wife is not expected to be with him. Zubeidat Tsarnaev is wanted on 2012 felony charges of shoplifting and property damage in Massachusetts, according to court officials. The family lived there before she jumped bail, and they moved the same year to Dagestan, a semi-autonomous region of Russia, officials said. She told Paton Walsh that she would like to travel to the United States. ""I really want to see how it is going to end,"" she said. ""I want to see my Tamerlan, if it's possible."" Keys to Boston attack could lie half a world away in restive region of Russia . The felony charges weren't ""a big deal"" and are unimportant to her, she said. ""What I care about is only the death of my oldest son, who I think was killed, and my youngest one, who is really ... needs the support."" U.S. officials had shown her and her husband ""pictures of dead body of Tamerlan,"" she said at the news conference. ""I did not look. I could not believe it is my son."" The shoplifting arrest isn't the first time Zubeidat Tsarnaev has been eyed by U.S. authorities. Russia raised concerns to U.S. authorities about her in 2011 at the same time they asked the United States about her son Tamerlan, several sources told CNN. U.S. authorities added both the mother and son to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database -- a collection of more than a half million names maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an intelligence official said. FBI agents interviewed Zubeidat Tsarnaev as part of its investigation into her son, whose case was closed after several months. 'Because they were Muslim' On Wednesday, FBI agents were in Makhachkala -- a city that Tamerlan Tsarnaev called home for several months in 2012 -- to talk with the suspects' parents. The conversation, which included members of Russia's federal security service, ended Wednesday evening, the suspects' mother told Saratova. Both parents have publicly said they believe their children are innocent and were framed: ""just because they were Muslim,"" as Zubeidat Tsarnaev put it. When asked whether she thinks her younger son will get a fair trial, she replied, ""Only Allah will know."" The Tsarnaevs are originally from the troubled Russian republic of Chechnya but fled from the brutal wars there in the 1990s. The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan and then lived in Dagestan and moved at different times to the United States. The family's adopted republic has become a focus for investigators, especially given that Tamerlan Tsarnaev went there during a six-month trip to Russia last year. On two occasions before that -- in March and late September 2011 -- Russian authorities asked U.S authorities to investigate Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Zubeidat Tsarnaev said the FBI had visited her family ""several times"" in 2011 with questions about Tamerlan's ""Islamic interests."" ""They said that they ... just think that Tamerlan is a kind of ... little on radical side of Islam and they just don't want ... they are keeping their eye on, you know, the boys, like young boys like Tamerlan so any bombing any like explosion won't happen in America. On the streets, like on the streets."" The FBI investigators told her there was nothing wrong with that, they just wanted everyone to be safe, she said. Tsarnaev case raises questions about post 9/11 . The Tsarnaevs and Misha . A friend named Misha, whom Tamerlan met in the United States, steered the older suspect toward a more devout practice of Islam, Tamerlan's relatives have said. ""Tamerlan was close friends with him, so they think that Misha made him ... become more deeply religious,"" Zubeidat said. She was impressed with the Armenian convert to Islam, who seemed ""very intelligent, nothing wrong."" He suggested that she cover her hair with a scarf, which she did. ""When Misha visited us ... he just opened our eyes, you know ... really wide about Islam. He was really, he's devoted, and he's very good, very nice man,"" Zubeidat Tsarnaev said. Friend ""brainwashed"" bombing suspect, uncle says . Tamerlan's uncle Ruslan Tsarni had a less favorable opinion. ""This person just took his brain,"" he said. ""He just brainwashed him completely."" Tamerlan, a former Golden Gloves boxer, left the ring and stopped listening to music under Misha's influence. Elmirza Khozhgov, a former brother-in-law of the brothers, said the elder Tsarnaev brother introduced him to a man named Misha, but ""I didn't witness him making him radical."" Zubeidat declined to be drawn on which mosques her son frequented, saying he went to any mosque he could go to. Media reports have focused on the Kotrova mosque in Makhachkala. And she vehemently denied reports that Tamerlan had sent her text messages talking about the radical nature of his faith and that he was ready to die for Islam. But, she said, he was always in her thoughts. ""I remember him always, always from the first day that he was born, there was no day that I don't remember him. ... He was the most caring son,"" she said.","Zubeidat Tsarnaev is in a U.S. database that includes terror suspects, official says .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, more than 25 years after he was treated for Hodgkin's disease, a spokesman at his company Vulcan Inc. told CNN on Monday. Allen, 56, ""received the diagnosis early this month and has begun chemotherapy,"" Vulcan CEO Jody Allen said in a memo to Vulcan employees. The memo was posted Monday evening on CNET's news site. ""Doctors say he has diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a relatively common form of lymphoma,"" Jody Allen, who is Paul Allen's sister, said in the memo. ""This is tough news for Paul and the family. But for those who know Paul's story, you know he beat Hodgkin's a little more than 25 years ago, and he is optimistic he can beat this, too."" The memo said Paul Allen is feeling OK, is still working and ""has no plans to change his role at Vulcan,"" which is based in Seattle, Washington. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, like the less-common Hodgkin's disease, is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Hodgkin's lymphoma is distinguished from the other by the presence of a certain type of cell. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in the mid-1970s, was that company's chief technologist until he left the company in 1983, the year he was treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to the Web site for his Paul G. Allen Family Foundations. In September, Allen ranked 17th in the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans.  His net worth was $11.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Among Allen's business interests are the professional sports teams he owns, the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. He also is part owner of Major League Soccer's Seattle Sounders FC. CNN's Katy Byron contributed to this report.","Allen diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma .

"(CNN) -- People have strong views about the way police officers treat minorities -- and they're eager to share those opinions. That became clear after CNN asked people on Twitter to use #AskACop to pose questions to police officers. Police conduct has been in the spotlight since the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The idea was that the network would use that hashtag to mine social media for questions to ask current and former police officers for a show that aired Tuesday night. People on Twitter responded in force, making #AskACop a trending hashtag well into Wednesday. People posted message after message -- but many of them were eager to make a point rather than ask a question. This reaction was not necessarily what was intended when the network asked: ""Are you curious about the police point of view re: recent US protests?"" for the show on Tuesday night. The show featured a calm, civil, evocative conversation with police officers. What unfolded online was a different story, with the proposal stirring up a lot of raw emotion. A majority of these tweets echoed the views of protesters in recent weeks, who have loudly railed against police in America for -- in their opinion -- profiling African-Americans. Many of them claim that Brown, Garner and other unarmed black men who died at the hands of white police officers might still be alive today if not for the color of their skin. Some were sarcastic, like one man who asked, ""if 1 Black man has zero guns, zero knives and 2 hands, how many bullets does it take to disarm him?"" Another on Wednesday openly wondered, ""If I'm only a quarter black do I get the benefit of the doubt before you shoot me?"" Others expressed the distrust some minorities have for police nowadays. For example, a ""young black/Hispanic woman"" asked, ""Any tips for who I'm supposed to teach my future children to go to if they need help?"" Some slammed what they called the ""senseless, excessive force and police brutality"" of some officers. One person suggested that the words ""Seek and Destroy"" rather than ""Serve and Protect"" should be on cruisers. And one wrote, ""When you were a child, did you want to grow & do heroic things? What went wrong?"" Of course, even if such voices dominated #AskACop, this debate is anything but one-sided. Many have defended police, saying they put their lives on the line daily and must make difficult, split-second decisions intended to save others. They say police are civil servants who work, day and night, to make this country safe -- not to divide it. That sentiment was reflected some on Twitter, like one person who posted a picture of three white officers surrounding a young, handicapped black boy with the words, ""Defend our first responders."" Another wrote, ""#AskACop if they know people are praying every day that they make the right choices in their stressful jobs."" At the least, the #AskACop hashtag showed that, while grand juries have their made decisions on the deaths of Brown and Garner, this debate isn't over. Whether intended or not, this social media endeavor became another forum for people to voice their strong views on this topic. As one man tweeted, ""if you really want to see what the public thinks of police officers just take a look at #AskACop."" .","CNN starts #AskACop so people can pose police questions amid great debate .

"He's being hailed as a hero, a teacher who stared down the barrel of a shooter's gun. And were it not for his bravery, authorities say, the horror that unfolded at Berrendo Middle School in Roswell, New Mexico, could have been worse. Much worse. John Masterson, a social studies teacher, is credited with talking a 12-year-old suspect into putting down his shotgun during a shooting at the school Tuesday. Masterson has taught at the school for a decade, and also coaches track and soccer, according to the Albuquerque Journal. When contacted by the newspaper, he said police told him not to discuss details of the shooting. ""It was a harrowing experience,""  he told the paper.  ""All I can say was the staff there did a great job."" New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez was more forthcoming. Masterson, she said, walked up to the shooter and convinced him to put the gun down.

"(CNN) -- In the cut throat world of big-time ocean racing, giant maxis are the undoubted leaders of the pack. Slicing through the water at 30 knots and more, vast distances can be covered in a few short days. But that speed comes at the price of severe discomfort for those getting the maximum out of the high tech 100 foot-plus yachts. ""This is a very aggressive world. It's banging, really noisy and with each wave you have the feeling you could break a bone,"" sailing legend Loick Peyron told CNN's Mainsail. And 54-year-old Frenchman Peyron should know. He skippered Banque Populaire V on its record-breaking circumnavigation of the world, a 29,000 miles non-stop journey, completed in just 45 days 13 hours and 42 minutes. Set in 2012 and landing the coveted Jules Verne Trophy -- Peyron's elder brother Bruno was a twice former holder of award -- the time slashed over two days off the former record and set an incredible average speed of 26.51 knots for the entire trip. But Peyron also had assistance from 13 other crew members during their helterskelter trip around the world, which earned them personal congratulations from then French president Nicolas Sarkozy. Taking part in solo efforts at the helm of such imposing yachts requires a different level of intestinal fortitude, fitness and raw courage altogether. Peyron knew only to well of the dangers when asked at very short notice to replace an injured compatriot, Armel Le Cleac'h, in the most prestigious of all single-handed transatlantic races. Not only that, the last time Peyron had competed in the Route du Rhum in 2002 he had to abandon when his 69ft trimaran Fujifilm broke up in a ""big, big, big storm"" in the Bay of Biscay and he was rescued from the wreckage by a ship. In fact, in six previous attempts dating back 32 years, Peyron's best finish was fifth and he had given up hope of landing one of the only prizes to elude him in his illustrious career. And then there was his age to consider, given the physical demands. Admittedly, he's no ""spring chicken,"" so when Ronan Lucas, the boss of the Banque Populaire team, asked him the question, Peyron's first response was an emphatic ""Non."" ""I was not dreaming any more about doing another transatlantic (race) alone on a boat able to win it,"" he said. ""That was the end of my dream."" Peyron, who is a key member of the Swedish America's Cup team Artemis, had intended to compete in the Route du Rhum on a ""little yellow trimaran"" -- content to let Le Cleac'h bid for line honors with the favored Banque Populaire VII. But all that changed when Le Cleac'h injured his hand two months ahead of the challenge. Lucas had total faith in the record breaking Peyron to be the perfect substitute, given his vast experience, but there was another factor which left the coveted skipper with so much doubt. The prospect of the lack of sleep for several days and fear of losing control of the 103-foot trimaran. ""Falling asleep it's really hard,"" he said. ""A boat like that could capsize in a few seconds, as we all know. The average speed is something like 30 knots or whatever. ""I'm supposed to be able to have a rest, you close your eyes, you keep the main sheet in your hand like that and you pray!"" Lucas implored him to think again about his decision, but it was Peyron's wife Christine who urged him to put aside his fears. After a night spent at sea alone -- ""feeding the two columns, the positive and the negative one"" -- his mind was made up. He would make one final attempt to win the Route du Rhum. Two months of intensive training followed, helped by Le Cleac'h, and on November 2 the 10th edition of the famous event got underway from St. Malo in France, the fleet heading to Guadeloupe. And as the race transpired, Peyron's fears about being able to handle the boat and conditions proved gloriously unfounded. He led from the first night and after 3,542 nautical miles, he crossed the finish line in seven days, 15 hours, eight minutes and 32 seconds, comfortably a new race record. ""I never imagined that I would win a Route du Rhum on a boat like this,"" Peyron said at the finish. But he admitted that throughout the race he was constantly on edge and his fears over falling asleep and losing control nearly came back to haunt him. ""I was able to sail the boat well but was scared,"" he told the official Artemis Racing website. ""You have to constantly manage the boat. One night I fell asleep at the helm and nearly capsized the boat."" It was his 49th Atlantic crossing -- 18 of them solo -- accomplished at an average speed of over 22 knots -- and given his doubts, very special. ""This is a great victory; possibly one of the nicest and breaking the record is the cherry on top of the cake,"" he added. Peyron, ""with brilliant stories to tell,"" according to Artemis Racing team boss Iain Percy, will now return to his day job of helping the syndicate win the 35th America's Cup in 2017. The team is based in San Francisco -- preparing for the racing in Bermuda where it will compete with others in the Louis Vuitton Cup, with the winner of that series facing holders Oracle for the biggest prize in yachting. The team is chock full of former Olympic champions from all classes, plus sailors with previous experience of America's Cups, including Peyron. He was at the helm with the Swiss challenge Alinghi in 2010 and joined up with Artemis just before the 2013 edition, which ended with defeat to the Italian Luna Rossa Challenge. With that experience behind it, Artemis will be hoping to up its game in 2017, but the syndicate was hit by tragedy last year when former British Olympic gold medalist Andrew Simpson died while training with the team in San Francisco Bay. Simpson, 36, drowned after their catamaran capsized, leaving him trapped underneath for over 10 minutes. He had paired with Percy to win the Star Class at the 2008 Beijing Games and silver on home waters at the London Olympics of 2012. Simpson, nicknamed ""Bart"" after the TV character, had a foundation formed in his memory and earlier this year it held its first event. Peyron was among a number of sailing greats to support Bart's Bash, which saw over 700 sailing clubs from 68 different countries stage their own race over a standard distance to set a new Guinness World Record for mass participation. Simpson will surely stay in the thoughts of Percy and his Artemis Racing team as it eyes the ultimate prize in the sport. Peyron had been totally focused on the America's Cup bid before being handed an unexpected opportunity to resume his solo career and he proved he is not a man to let a challenge pass, however daunting. ""When you know that it's part of your life to do this sort of challenge, this crazy challenge, it's normal,"" he said.","Yachting legend Loick Peyron wins Route du Rhum .

"Sitting cross-legged at her office desk, Abhina Aher expounds on what it means to be trapped in the wrong body. She is a 37-year-old Hijra -- a South Asian term for male-to-female transgendered people. She appears at ease when she speaks about her sexual orientation and about the stereotypes associated with her community. Aher is relaxed because she's in the confines of a non-profit workplace espousing the cause of sexual minorities like herself.  Here, she's not judged by her deep voice or her masculine face, its lines softened by make-up, or by her feminine dresses, nail-polish and jewelry. Aher has gained a new found place in her country.  India's Supreme Court recently granted her and other transgendered people, status as a third gender. So, men can now be identified as females and females can be identified as males. But the outside world, she says, is harsh. In a largely conservative, family-structured region, proclaiming you are not what you are born could entail a harrowing ordeal that Aher suffered -- and survived. She raised a few eyebrows when she first slipped into her mother's sari at the age of six. Her cross-dressing habits, she remembers, were then ignored for some time. But her secret desire to break free from her anatomic sex would only become more intense as she grew older. ""The issue about gender and sexuality kept coming back to me. But the unfortunate part of that was I did not have anybody to talk to; I had no one to share my thoughts with,"" Aher says. From rejection to acceptance . Aher's self-discovery created a sense of loss for her widowed mother, for whom Aher was a boy. ""My mother would take me to a temple and make me swear by God that I would change my behavior,"" Aher said. ""But it was beyond my control."" And Aher was rejected. Her mother didn't speak with her for almost nine years. Her teachers weren't supportive either. Rather, she became a target of jeers. The hurt became deeper when she stepped into the adult world. Her lovers, she says, also abandoned her. ""My journey was lonely. All my lovers rejected me. They either used me for money, or for sexual pleasure or for some momentary emotional support. There was a huge vacuum,"" she says, her voice thick with emotion. That's when, she says, she set off on a journey for acceptance within the Hijra community. And as is the protocol, the initiation into the fold required her to pursue a Hijra ""guru"" or a mentor, which she did. She also underwent a long, drawn-out feminization process. The reward, she says, was priceless: liberation. In contrast to Aher, opportunities for employment are extremely limited for most members of the Hijra community. Many end up in prostitution and begging on streets, she says. At a 45-minute drive from her office, a cramped, three-storied building along an unpaved road serves as a multi-purpose center for transgender and gay people. Volunteers walk up and down its dusty, unplastered stairs for an HIV counseling session on the first floor. According to the Indian government, the country's transgender community is seen as disproportionately vulnerable to the deadly infection despite its tiny size. A portion of a dimly lit room segregated by makeshift partitions is then used as a practice hall for the young Hijra members to hone their skills in dancing. In today's wired world, they don't have to outsource professional instrument players. Instead, it's just a case of hooking a set of speakers into a mobile phone before setting off, dancing and lip-syncing to popular Bollywood songs. But beneath the joyous mood, despair lurks. Many Hijras at this center are at least 10 years younger than Aher. They say they, too, faced tough social resistance to their choice to reject gender binarism. Kyra Sharma, 27, says her family thought she was under the influence of black magic when she starting cross-dressing and applying cosmetic powder to her eyes. She suppressed her true nature for a while. ""I had to wear male outfits although I didn't feel comfortable,"" Sharma says. Her brother, she says, was more rigid than others. ""There was a deadline for me to be home at 8 pm every day. Life became difficult."" But as transgender issues attracted more attention, she used the increased media focus to explain to her family she's not the only one. ""Eventually, there was some understanding. Thankfully, I don't have to retreat into my biological sexual appearance now when I am home,"" says Sharma, who aims to become a make-up artist. Equal rights for transgender and gay people . Within a span of few months, India's Supreme Court has come out with what activists say are conflicting judgments, on transgenders and Hijras on one hand, and the gay community on the other. This month, the justices granted Hijras the right to self-identify their gender in what has been hailed as a historic ruling to end centuries-old discrimination against the country's transgender citizens. In December 2013 though, the same top court re-criminalized consensual homosexual relationships, reinstating a colonial-era law banning people from engaging in ""carnal acts against the order of nature."" Known as Section 377, that law was initially struck down in 2009 by a high court in New Delhi but its reinstatement has led to fears for gay people in the country. Many of them came out in the open about their relationships when Section 377 was thrown out in 2009. Image consultant Rishi Raj, who is gay, is now apprehensive. ""What happens to those teenagers and those young people who came out of the closet thinking that 'my country is on my side, the court is on my side and my parents can't throw me out'?"" he asks. The anti-gay law and its revival, he feels, violate personal freedoms in a diverse democracy. ""How can you take away something which is integrally my right -- what happens behind closed doors in my bedroom -- and judge me for that? (To) call me a criminal for making love? It's just silly.""

"(CNN) -- As special-operations military troops prepared for a firefight about 7,000 miles away, President Barack Obama entered a room in the Washington area early in the afternoon on Sunday to follow along. Like a page plucked from a Hollywood screenplay, Obama and other principal coordinators for the mission that killed Osama bin Laden convened in a ""situation room"" to remotely monitor the situation, John Brennan, the U.S. counterterrorism chief, said in a White House news briefing on Monday. Obama arrived after many of the mission's leaders had assembled there, but the president joined before the attack on bin Laden's mansion in Abbottabad, Pakistan, began, Brennan said. ""We were able to monitor on a real-time basis the progress of the operation, from its commencement, to its time on target, to the extraction of the remains,"" Brennan said. ""We were able to have regular updates to ensure that we had real-time visibility into the progress of the operation."" The mood in the room was anxious because the stakes were so high, Brennan said. ""There were some very tense moments,"" he said. ""We were just saying our prayers that everything would go according to plan."" The White House and Central Intelligence Agency didn't have access to a live audio feed, but they were able to tap other communications, a U.S. official told CNN. There was some live video, though the official declined to elaborate on the nature of that footage. The Los Angeles Times reported that the CIA had led the bin Laden attack operation, and officials on the 7th floor of the agency's Langley, Virginia, headquarters had access to live video of the raid, the report said. Brennan declined to say whether they had access to a video feed or radio communications. A White House spokesman declined to comment. Google, Apple and other Internet companies have mastered the process of streaming live video from events to the world. But that task would get much trickier if the cameramen are also carrying rifles and broadcasting from an untested, faraway locale. After Obama had signed off on the operation, CIA Director Leon Panetta gave the official order around midday Sunday for the operation to commence, the Times reported. ""We have rid the world of the most infamous terrorist of our time,"" Panetta said in a statement Monday. ""We gave President Obama and his team accurate, relevant, timely intelligence -- providing the information and insight they needed at key points as this mission developed."" The CIA had been tracking bin Laden and provided intelligence to the White House saying the agency was ""confident"" the terrorist leader was inside the Pakistan compound, Brennan said. ""It was probably one of the most anxiety-filled periods of time, I think, in the lives of the people who were assembled here yesterday,"" Brennan said. ""The minutes passed like days, and the president was very concerned about the security of our personnel. That was what was on his mind throughout."" Shortly after taking office in 2009, Obama had directed Panetta ""to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al Qaeda,"" the president said in his speech Sunday night. ""We give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who've worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome. The American people do not see their work, nor know their names."" However, Obama apparently does get to see their work as it's being carried out. CNN's Pam Benson contributed to this report.","President Obama is said to have watched live video of the attack on Osama bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- The man accused of trying to blow up a U.S.-bound airliner on Christmas Day attended an Islamic ""Knowledge Fest"" in Houston, Texas, in 2008, according to one of the organizers of the event. Yasir Qadhi, who was an instructor at ""Ilm Fest,"" said the 16-day conference organized by the Al Maghrib Institute was a series of courses and workshops to teach young Muslims ""the nuts and bolts of Islam."" Suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab attended some of the classes that Qadhi taught during the event, which ran from August 1 to 17, 2008. ""He was a very quiet individual, tight-lipped and shy, and he did not ask a single question during the discussions,"" Qadhi said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""He barely interacted with the other students at the conference."" AbdulMutallab was not a visible presence during the conference and did not attend all the sessions, recalled Qadhi. Qadhi recalls speaking to AbdulMutallab and remembers that he was ""very reserved in his responses."" AbdulMutallab also attended two seminars organized by the Al Maghrib Institute in London in the months before the event in Houston, Qadhi said. One of the events was on the life of the Prophet Mohammed, and the other course was on the first chapter of the Koran. ""This was mainstream Islamic stuff,"" said Qadhi. Qadhi said the institute taught young Muslims a ""orthodox Islam for the 21st Century,"" stressing the importance of the literal text of the Quran but imbuing those words with a modern meaning. ""We are trying to carve out a Western Muslim identity among conservative Muslims -- for Muslims to integrate into Western society but maintain their Islamic identity."" Qadhi, of New Haven, Connecticut, has been involved in de-radicalization efforts in the United States and was a leading participant in the U.S. Counter-Radicalization Strategy conference organized by the National Counterterrorism Center in the summer of 2008. ""It's ironic that he came to us,"" said Qadhi of AbdulMutallab. The Al Maghrib Institute has chapters in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and has taught more than 30,000 young Muslims in its courses. Qadhi says there was no indication AbdulMutallab in 2008 was extreme in his views. After the Houston event, AbdulMutallab did not sign up for any more Al Maghrib events, said Qadhi -- perhaps a sign he was starting to become influenced by extremist ideas, he added. ""At some level, we did not convince him of the validity of our views,"" says Qadhi, ""and that is cause for regret."" ""What AbdulMutallab probably doesn't realize is that by his actions he has hurt the very same people -- Muslims -- who he was purportedly trying to defend."" CNN's Paul Cruickshank and David Mattingly contributed to this report.","AbdulMutallab went to conference for young Muslims on ""the nuts and bolts of Islam""

"(CNN) -- The online whistle-blower site WikiLeaks began publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies around the world Sunday, spawning sharp condemnation from the White House and congressional leaders. WikiLeaks, which said its servers were under electronic attacks Sunday afternoon, said the documents represent the largest-ever disclosure of confidential information and give the world ""an unprecedented insight into the U.S. government's foreign activities."" ""The cables show the U.S. spying on its allies and the U.N.; turning a blind eye to corruption and human rights abuse in 'client states'; backroom deals with supposedly neutral countries; and lobbying for U.S. corporations,"" the site's editor-in-chief and spokesman, Julian Assange, said in a statement released Sunday evening. ""This document release reveals the contradictions between the U.S.'s public persona and what it says behind closed doors -- and shows that if citizens in a democracy want their governments to reflect their wishes, they should ask to see what's going on behind the scenes."" But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs condemned the release, warning that publishing the documents would jeopardize ""our diplomats, intelligence professionals and people around the world who come to the United States for assistance in promoting democracy and open government."" ""By releasing stolen and classified documents, WikiLeaks has put at risk not only the cause of human rights but also the lives and work of these individuals,"" Gibbs said. ""We condemn in the strongest terms the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents and sensitive national security information."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reached out to leaders of eight countries over the weekend about the leaks, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Sunday. Those countries included Germany, Saudi Arabia, Britain, France, Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates, Crowley said. The New York Times and four European newspapers that had received the documents in advance began publishing excerpts earlier Sunday. Many of them detail conversations on sensitive issues between American officials and leaders in the Middle East, Afghanistan and elsewhere. The major topics in the documents include: . -- Pressure from U.S. allies in the Middle East for decisive action to neutralize Iran's nuclear program. According to one cable, King Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah of Bahrain told Gen. David Petraeus, then the top U.S. commander in the region, that the United States must curb Iran's nuclear program by whatever means necessary. ""The danger of letting it go on is greater than the danger of stopping it,"" the king is quoted as saying. Similarly, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia implored Washington to ""cut off the head of the snake"" while there was still time, according to a cable cited by the British newspaper The Guardian. -- Conversations between Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and Petraeus about military action against al Qaeda militants in Yemen. A cable about their January meeting reports Saleh as saying: ""We'll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours."" At that point, according to a cable sent by the then-U.S. ambassador in Yemen, the deputy prime minister joked ""that he had just 'lied' by telling Parliament"" that Yemeni forces had carried out the strikes. -- Washington's efforts to have highly enriched uranium removed from a Pakistani research reactor. In a cable sent in May 2009, the U.S. ambassador in Islamabad said Pakistan was refusing to schedule a visit by American technical experts. The ambassador said that a Pakistani official had told her: ""If the local media got word of the fuel removal, 'they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistan's nuclear weapons.' "" -- Negotiations with governments over the transfer of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. According to The New York Times, ""Slovenia was told to take a prisoner if it wanted to meet with President (Barack) Obama, while the island nation of Kiribati was offered incentives worth millions of dollars to take in a group of detainees."" -- Concern that the Chinese government was involved in global computer hacking. One cable cited by The New York Times said a Chinese contact had told the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that the Politburo had directed ""the intrusion into Google's computer system"" earlier this year. WikiLeaks said the full set included 251,288 cables sent by American diplomats between the end of 1966 and February 2010. Of those, 8,017 originated from the office of the secretary of state, and more than 15,600 are classified as secret, it said in a statement announcing the release. WikiLeaks said the documents will be released in stages ""over the next few months"" to allow readers to digest them. ""The subject matter of these cables is of such importance, and the geographical spread so broad, that to do otherwise would not do this material justice,"" it said. ""We owe it to the people who entrusted us with the documents to ensure that there is time for them to be written about, commented on and discussed widely in public, something that is impossible if hundreds of thousands of documents are released at once."" Sen. John Kerry, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the disclosure ""reckless."" ""This is not an academic exercise about freedom of information and it is not akin to the release of the Pentagon Papers, which involved an analysis aimed at saving American lives and exposing government deception,"" Kerry, D-Massachusetts, said in a written statement. ""Instead, these sensitive cables contain candid assessments and analysis of ongoing matters and they should remain confidential to protect the ability of the government to conduct lawful business with the private candor that's vital to effective diplomacy,"" the statement said. The documents posted include often-unfavorable commentaries on a variety of international leaders, as well as coverage of almost every major issue of recent years. The United States had warned Assangethat publishing the papers would be illegal and could endanger peoples' lives. Rep. Peter King, the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, on Sunday called on the Obama administration to prosecute Assange. In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, King said WikiLeakshas provided ""material support to terrorist organizations"" by releasing the documents. ""There should be no misconception that Mr. Assange passively operates a forum for others to exploit their misappropriation of classified information,"" King wrote. ""He actively encourages and solicits the leaking of national defense information. He pursues a malicious agenda, for which he remains totally immune to the consequences of his actions."" The site said it was already under fire Sunday afternoon. In a statement posted on Twitter, WikiLeakssaid it was experiencing a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. That's an effort to make a website unavailable to users, normally by flooding it with requests for data. But WikiLeaks posted information on the new documents Sunday afternoon on a site with a different web address. The cables being detailed Sunday follow two similar releases by WikiLeaks earlier this year. In July, the site released more than 70,000 U.S. military reports from the war in Afghanistan, and nearly 400,000 more reports about operations in Iraq in October. The site indicated last week that a new batch was coming, telling followers on Twitter that the new release would be seven times the size of the Iraq documents. ""Intense pressure over it for months,"" the group stated. ""Keep us strong."" In addition to the Times, four European newspapers -- Britain's The Guardian, Le Monde in France, Der Spiegel in Germany and El Pais in Spain -- had prior access to WikiLeaks documents. CNN has not had advance access to the documents because it declined to sign a confidentiality agreement with the site. Retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, the former U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, said the documents reveal sensitive U.S. government positions and put diplomats at risk ""for their candidness and their reporting."" ""I think it's important for WikiLeaks and its ilk to recognize the damage that they're doing by releasing this information and be held responsible for the damage that occurs from releasing this information,"" said Kimmitt, who served in the State Department and as the U.S. military spokesman in Iraq during the Bush administration. But Scott Shane, one of the authors of the Times report, said the disclosures are most notable for their ""behind-the-scenes stories -- how we speak to other countries and how they speak to us."" Shane told CNN the newspaper does not believe its reporting will result in drastic consequences, and that the Times redacted some names and information in the cables after discussions with State Department. ""Our judgment was that while there certainly would be repercussions, there would be strained relations perhaps with certain countries or certain leaders, we did not think that there would be lives at stake,"" he said. ""We did not think that there would be important intelligence operations that would be compromised by the material we're actually publishes. The U.S. State Department's legal adviser, Harold Hongju Koh, said Saturday that his agency had had spoken with representatives from the Times, the Guardian and Der Spiegel about 250,000 documents that WikiLeaks had provided to them. Kohdescribed the distribution as the ""illegal dissemination of classified documents.""

"(CNN) -- The father of terrorism suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab talked about his son's extremist views with someone from the CIA and a report was prepared, but the report was not circulated outside the agency, a reliable source told CNN's Jeanne Meserve on Tuesday. Had that information been shared, the 23-year-old Nigerian who is alleged to have bungled an attempt to blow up a jetliner as it was landing in Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day might have been denied passage on the Northwest Airlines flight, the source said. U.S. officials said the father, a former Nigerian banker, expressed his concerns about his son's radicalization during at least one meeting and several calls with officials at the embassy in Nigeria. The information on AbdulMutallab had been sent to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, but it sat there for five weeks and was not disseminated, the source said. Federal authorities have charged AbdulMutallab with trying to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, made its final approach to Detroit. The device failed to fully detonate, instead setting off a fire at his seat. An administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the federal government had information that should have been assessed and meshed with other information ""that would have allowed us to disrupt the attempted terrorist attack"" before the suspect boarded the jet. ""What we have here is a situation in which the failings were individual, organizational, systemic and technological,"" the official said. ""We ended up in a situation where a single point of failure in the system put our security at risk, where human error was compounded by systemic deficiencies in a way that we cannot allow to continue."" But an intelligence official said that the son's name, passport number and possible connection to extremists were indeed disseminated. ""I'm not aware of a magic piece of intelligence somehow withheld that would have put AbdulMutallab on the no-fly list,"" the official said. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said department staff did what they were supposed to have done by sending a cable to the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington about the matter. Kelly said any decision to have revoked the suspect's visa would have been an interagency decision. But a U.S. government official said the information in the cable offered nothing specific and was just one of hundreds of such reports that the center evaluates daily. The bureaucratic fingerpointing erupted shortly after President Obama on Tuesday blamed ""a mix of human and systemic failures"" for the incident and directed that preliminary findings into the matter be delivered to the White House by Thursday.","Source: CIA had report on AbdulMutallab weeks before bombing attempt on plane .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Abu Laith al-Libi, a wanted al Qaeda terrorist, was killed in Pakistan by a CIA airstrike, three U.S. officials told CNN Thursday. Abu Laith al-Libi in April 2007 during a videotaped interview by al Qaeda's media wing. Al-Libi was described as a senior al Qaeda leader believed to have plotted and executed attacks against U.S. and coalition forces, including a February 2007 bombing at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan during a visit by Vice President Dick Cheney. He was on a ""most wanted"" list of 12 accused terrorists which was issued in October by the Combined Joint Task Force-82 -- an anti-terror unit in Afghanistan. Earlier, a knowledgeable Western official and a military source confirmed al-Libi's death to CNN. The same official said al-Libi is ""not far below the importance of the top two al Qaeda leaders"" -- Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. The officials said al-Libi was killed by a missile from an airplane. Radical Islamist Web sites announced al-Libi's death. ""May God have mercy on Sheikh Abu Laith al-Libi and accept him with his brothers, with the martyrs,"" said a eulogy posted on a main Islamist site, Al-Ekhlaas. Al-Libi, 41, was of Libyan descent and was believed to have been in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border region, according to the U.S. military. A U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN he was a significant, senior al Qaeda figure who had taken on a more prominent role in the organization in recent years. This official also confirmed that al-Libi was responsible for plotting attacks targeting U.S. and coalition forces as well as Afghan officials.  Watch senior Arab affairs editor Octavia Nasr detail al-Libi's significance » . In an earlier role, he was a leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which eventually merged with al Qaeda, the counterterrorism official said, and was responsible for planning attacks throughout North Africa and the Middle East. The official described al-Libi as part of al Qaeda's inner circle, who helped fill the void created by the capture or death of other senior people in the organization. A U.S. military official with Combined Joint Task Force-82 said they have no information on al-Libi's death. But he added that CJTF-82 does not collect information from outside of Afghanistan, and would be informed of targeted operations only ""if the Pakistani military share(s) that with us."" The Pakistani military said an explosion occurred in North Waziristan on Tuesday, and 12 people were killed. However, it was unclear whether this was the incident in which al-Libi was killed. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN it was not clear who attacked whom and that he could not comment on the identities of the dead since local al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates removed the bodies and buried them. The U.S. military placed al-Libi on its most wanted list in 2006, behind bin Laden, al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar. In October, they announced rewards ranging from $20,000 to $200,000 for al-Libi and 11 other mid-level Taliban and al Qaeda leaders. At that time, the military distributed posters and billboards with pictures and names of the insurgents around eastern Afghanistan. Al-Libi and the others were described at the time by CJTF-82 spokesman Maj. Chris Belcher as ""mid-level bad guys."" He appeared in a 2002 audio recording posted on an Islamist Web site, saying al Qaeda had regrouped and intended to expand its war to include assassinations and attacks against infrastructure. He also appeared in a 2004 video that showed him participating in an attack on an Afghan army base. Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a statement saying al-Libi's reported death would be ""a positive development"" in efforts against terrorism. ""Intelligence points to, and his [al-Libi's] increasing role in al Qaeda propaganda suggests, that he would have been a top field commander and planner for al Qaeda,"" Hoekstra said. ""His death, if confirmed, clearly will have an impact on the radical jihadist movement."" He said that through the committee, he would monitor the effects on al Qaeda operations.

"(CNN) -- Radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr thanked followers who offered to launch attacks against the U.S. military in Iraq should he reinstate his notorious Mehdi Army militia, according to a posting on his website. The exchange between a follower and al-Sadr on his website comes as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is talking with members of his government about the possibility of requesting American troops to stay in Iraq beyond a year-end deadline to withdraw. Al-Sadr vowed earlier this year to ""escalate armed resistance"" if the U.S. military does not pull its troops as scheduled, a move that could destabilize the country should the Mehdi Army repeat the bloody battles it waged against American and Iraqi forces during the height of violence. ""We intended to be martyred, if you intend to lift the freeze of Imam al-Mehdi Army to defend Islam, doctrine and Iraq. Our martyrdom will be restricted only on activities against the infidel occupier without harming the civilians or any public proprieties,"" an unidentified follower posted on the website on Friday. Al-Sadr responded: ""Thank you dears... May God preserve you and watch over you."" A U.S. military spokesman on Sunday told CNN that, ""Muqtada al-Sadr's statement speaks sufficiently for itself about his attitude toward the use of violence as an alternative to democratic processes."" ""It's the same attitude that has caused so much violence for the Iraqi people in the past,"" Col. Barry Johnson said. ""We are not inclined to characterize it further at this point."" Since 2003, al-Sadr has had the support of tens of thousands of Shiites, especially the young and impoverished in Baghdad's slums and the Shiite south. His Mehdi Army has been considered one of Iraq's most formidable private armies following the fall of Saddam Hussein. It was blamed for some of the worst sectarian violence in Iraq before al-Sadr suspended most of its activities in 2007 and 2008, which dramatically reduced violence in Iraq. In 2008, al-Sadr announced that most of the militia members would be transitioned into a socio-cultural organization to oppose secularism and Western thought. A small group of hand-picked fighters called the Promised Day Brigade would continue to target the coalition, the U.S. military has said. Al-Sadr has ratcheted his anti-American rhetoric up in recent months, raising concerns about an increase in violence as Iraq weighs whether to request that some of the 47,000 troops in Iraq stay beyond a January 1, 2012, deadline agreed upon between the two countries. An increase in attacks in recent months against American troops has been blamed on Shiite militias, including the Promised Day Brigade. The U.S. military says the militia is using the bombings to try to take credit for driving forces out of the country. The U.S. military maintains that the Promised Day Brigade and other Shiite militias are backed by Iran, a charge Tehran has long denied. The cleric, who recently returned to Iraq from three years of self-imposed exile, has transformed himself from the leader of the Mehdi Army to a political player. His political bloc has now joined forces with a former rival, al-Maliki. The al-Sadr movement emerged as one of the kingmakers in Iraqi politics last year when it won 39 parliamentary seats. The bloc's support played a major role in al-Maliki getting his second term in office.

"Washington (CNN) -- Analysts and sources say a combination of experience working with the CIA in the field and political considerations are behind President Barack Obama's expected nomination of Gen. David Petraeus to be the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Petraeus, the 58-year-old four-star general who commands the U.S.-led international military force in Afghanistan, represents a new breed of military leader well-versed in counter-insurgency strategies that depend on coordination and cooperation with the CIA, analysts say. His experience and strong contacts in the major foreign-policy hot spots for the Obama administration -- Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan -- provide strategic value for the leader of CIA operations on the ground in those countries, according to security experts. Obama reorganizes national security team . ""He has a unique understanding of the important role of the CIA -- what they do, how they do it,"" said Frances Townsend, CNN's security analyst who was a homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush. ""I think he's got a both a good understanding of how they work and their value to the military mission."" Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer now at the Brookings Institution's Saban Center for Middle East Policy, called the expected nomination of Petraeus a good move for the administration and the CIA. ""He has a great deal of experience in dealing with the most difficult problems confronting the American intelligence community today,"" Riedel told CNN. ""He also brings the perspective of a battlefield commander to the intelligence community."" At the same time, Petraeus also was considered a credible candidate to succeed Adm. Mike Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when Mullen's term expires this year. As the architect and leader of the surge in Iraq and now head of the Afghanistan mission, Petraeus is considered the nation's most well-known and popular military leader since Colin Powell. Sources told CNN that Petraeus, whose current tour in Afghanistan is winding up with the expected start of a troop drawdown later this year, never really wanted to be Joint Chiefs chairman. Instead, Petraeus wanted to be in a ""command"" rather than the joint chief chairman's advisory role to the president, the sources said. For the White House, the sources noted, the CIA role for Petraeus gives him an important command position that tends to stay out of the public spotlight, which could be important given Petraeus' strong personality and the pending challenges of the Afghanistan mission as the presidential campaign gets going. Some conservatives complained that moving Petraeus to the CIA would deny the nation his leadership in a key role as the nation's top military officer. ""It seems clear that the administration's number one desire was to deny one of the greatest generals of the last century the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs,"" said Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It is an incredible misuse of a great military leader, and the notion that someone of his caliber should go from turning around two wars to being number two in the U.S. intelligence community seems almost comical,"" she added, referring to Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper as being the head of U.S. intelligence. Townsend called a move to the CIA for Petraeus ""surprising,"" given his military command experience. ""Is it the obvious next step in his illustrious career? No,"" Townsend said, adding: ""But he'll do very well at it."" Riedel said Petraeus knows the Washington decision-making process and probably never would have agreed to the move without a guarantee of access to Obama. ""Any appointment in every administration has political angles to it,"" Riedel said. ""The David Petraeus I know is not a shrinking violet. If he thinks a decision is a wrong, decision, he'll have ways of making that clear."" Petraeus enjoys widespread popularity in Congress. Republican Rep. Peter King of New York, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, praised the choice of Petraeus to head the CIA in a statement Wednesday. However, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, indicated Petraeus could face tough questioning from her panel. ""He is clearly a very accomplished officer and familiar with the parts of the world where many of the threats to our security originate,"" Feinstein said, noting that Petraeus has commanded intelligence resources in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""But that is a different role than leading the top civilian intelligence agency. I look forward to hearing his vision for the CIA and his plans to make sure the CIA is collecting the type of intelligence that policymakers need."" Rick Nelson, national security expert from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Petraeus has ""a lot of respect around Washington and in the broader international community, which is very important as head of the CIA."" ""Petraeus has the gravitas to deal with Congress, the administration, and the other executive branch agencies,"" Nelson noted. The general literally wrote the book on counterinsurgency techniques by overseeing development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual. In heading the U.S.-led military missions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, he has experienced and benefited from the CIA's support and increased the CIA role, including the operation of unmanned drone strikes in Pakistan. While the CIA role in Iraq, in combating al Qaeda and in the Pakistan drone operation ""has grown tremendously"" under Petraeus' military command, he also understands the limitations of what the CIA can do, Rieder said. That could make his term as CIA director ""a bit of fresh air"" for the agency, Rieder said, adding: ""He will say I'm very proud of your successes, but there are areas where you can do better and I intend to make this organization better."" The last military officer to head the CIA was Michael Hayden, a four-star Air Force general who took office in uniform in 2006 but then retired his military post in 2008 under ""some pressure from Congress,"" according to Townsend. Sources including a senior administration official said Petraeus also would retire from the military once confirmed and would be a civilian director of the CIA. ""The CIA should be a civilian organization, and we want it to have that cultural identity,"" Townsend said. Asked about the importance of having a civilian at its helm, she said: ""I don't really think it matters. It's dependent on the person and it's dependent on the mission.""

"Palisades, New York (CNN) -- The recent volcanic eruption in Iceland is stranding hundreds of thousands of air travelers at Heathrow Airport in the UK and other airports across northern Europe, due to its voluminous clouds of volcanic ash that can clog airplane engines and limit visibility. However, this is by no means the first such volcanic eruption in Iceland to affect human activities. Long before the advent of air travel, the eruption of Iceland's Laki volcano in 1783-84 had profound effects on climate, not just in Iceland but around the globe. Volcanologists Thorvaldur Thordarson and Stephen Self estimated that a comparable event in the modern era would release enough ash and other eruptive materials into the atmosphere that the resulting ash cloud and sulfuric haze would probably disrupt air travel over much of the Northern Hemisphere for about five months. But there were impacts well afield of Iceland and Europe at the time of Laki. Besides releasing clouds of ash into the atmosphere that can disrupt visibility and damage airplane engines, eruptions can cool the climate with the reflection of incoming solar radiation from the troposphere by volcanic sulfur-rich ash, which can decrease temperatures significantly for months or years in some cases. Just such an aerosol effect is believed to have disrupted the Earth's thermal balance during the Laki event, cooling some Northern Hemisphere regions by as much as 1 or more degrees Celsius below the long-term average. Highly unusual conditions were described in the summer of 1783 after Laki, including poisonous volcanic fumes that killed perhaps 25 percent of the population of Iceland, persistent haze and oppressive heat in Europe, and blood-red sunrises over North America, Europe and other locations. The Laki eruption was believed to have caused thousands of deaths because of unusual conditions in Europe that summer, along with the severe cold of the following winter. Benjamin Franklin was one of the first to suggest that the extreme cold of 1783-84 over much of the Northern Hemisphere was connected to the Laki event. In North America, Laki has been blamed for the starvation of Inuit populations from severe cold in northwestern Alaska, based on Inuit oral history as well as tree-ring density data investigated by Gordon Jacoby and others, who estimated that conditions were about 4 degrees Celsius colder than the mean. The density record of temperature-sensitive white spruce for this region showed extremely low values in the summer of 1783, known in Inuit lore as ""the summer that did not come"". This observation was used to infer that this was the coldest summer in at least the past 400 years. Such tree-ring records, along with other so-called proxy archives, can provide a wealth of information about volcanic events and their varying impacts around the globe because of resulting shifts in atmospheric circulation and other climate changes, dating for centuries prior to the period of instrumental record. The effects of major volcanic eruptions such as Laki can also be felt elsewhere on the globe, often far from their actual location. For example, significant cooling and strong dynamical effects after the Laki event and other high-latitude eruptions are believed to have caused decreased flow of the Nile River in Egypt and weakened African and Asian monsoons based on climate model simulations, with potentially very significant impacts on food and water supplies. Tree-ring, coral and ice core records also indicate the effect of major volcanic events in the tropics of monsoon Asia for low-latitude eruptions such as that of Tambora, Indonesia, in 1815 and other such events of the past several centuries, although this climate signal is also complicated by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Although the current eruption of Eyjafjallajoekull in Iceland appears not to be comparable in intensity to those of Laki and Tambora, it will have some effects, such as those on air travel, that were never realized back in those simpler times. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rosanne D'Arrigo.","Ash from Iceland volcano has grounded much of western Europe's air traffic .

"(CNN)If you think you are tech savvy all because you know what ""LOL"" means, let me test your coolness. Any idea what ""IWSN"" stands for in Internet slang? It's a declarative statement: I want sex now. If it makes you feel any better, I had no clue, and neither did a number of women I asked about it. Acronyms are widely popular across the Internet, especially on social media and texting apps, because, in some cases, they offer a shorthand for communication that is meant to be instant. So ""LMK"" -- let me know -- and ""WYCM"" -- will you call me? -- are innocent enough. But the issue, especially for parents, is understanding the slang that could signal some dangerous teen behavior, such as ""GNOC,'"" which means ""get naked on camera."" And it certainly helps for a parent to know that ""PIR"" means parent in room, which could mean the teen wants to have a conversation about things that his or her mom and dad might not approve of. Katie Greer is a national Internet safety expert who has provided Internet and technology safety training to schools, law enforcement agencies and community organizations throughout the country for more than seven years. She says research shows that a majority of teens believe that their parents are starting to keep tabs on their online and social media lives. ""With that, acronyms can be used by kids to hide certain parts of their conversations from attentive parents,"" Greer said. ""Acronyms used for this purpose could potentially raise some red flags for parents."" But parents would drive themselves crazy, she said, if they tried to decode every text, email and post they see their teen sending or receiving. ""I've seen some before and it's like 'The Da Vinci Code,' where only the kids hold the true meanings (and most of the time they're fairly innocuous),"" she said. Still, if parents come across any acronyms they believe could be problematic, they should talk with their kids about them, said Greer. But how, on earth, is a parent to keep up with all these acronyms, especially since new ones are being introduced every day? ""It's a lot to keep track of,"" Greer said. Parents can always do a Google search if they stumble upon an phrase they aren't familiar with, but the other option is asking their children, since these phrases can have different meanings for different people. ""Asking kids not only gives you great information, but it shows that you're paying attention and sparks the conversation around their online behaviors, which is imperative."" Micky Morrison, a mom of two in Islamorada, Florida, says she finds Internet acronyms ""baffling, annoying and hilarious at the same time."" She's none too pleased that acronyms like ""LOL"" and ""OMG"" are being adopted into conversation, and already told her 12-year-old son -- whom she jokingly calls ""deprived,"" since he does not have a phone yet -- that acronym talk is not allowed in her presence. But the issue really came to a head when her son and his adolescent friends got together and were all ""ignoring one another with noses in their phones,"" said Morrison, founder of BabyWeightTV. ""I announced my invention of a new acronym: 'PYFPD.'  Put your freaking phone down."" LOL! But back to the serious issue at hand, below are 28 Internet acronyms, which I learned from Greer and other parents I talked with, as well as from sites such as NoSlang.com and NetLingo.com, and from Cool Mom Tech's 99 acronyms and phrases that every parent should know.

"(CNN) -- What would you do if you were Vladimir Putin? What would you do if you were a Russian citizen? Russia's economic problems -- slowly incubating in recent months -- are about to get a lot worse. And that should make all of us nervous. The stomach-turning free fall of the ruble, the Russian currency, revealed the impending crisis. It may seem like a matter of economics, but at this level it is about politics, and when it comes to Putin, politics does not stop at the Russian border. Putin will try to blame Russia's problems on the West. He will work to bolster support at home, rally the public by making Russians feel besieged by the outside world, mostly by the United States and its NATO allies. That could end up creating even more dangerous tensions between Moscow and Washington, between Russia and the West. And Putin has shown he is not afraid of using every instrument of power, including his military forces, to achieve his goals. The walls are closing in on Putin's Russia. The spectacular collapse in global oil prices has led to an even more dramatic crumbling of the Russian currency, all of it coming at the same time as economic sanctions the West had imposed after Putin's forces captured Crimea, legally part of Ukraine, and stoked a separatist war between pro-Russian Ukrainians and the central government in Kiev. In his annual speech to the nation this month, Putin told Russians that the West is determined to keep Russia from becoming strong, that Ukraine was not the real reason for the sanctions. ""If none of that (Ukraine) had ever happened,"" he said, ""they would have come up with some other excuse to try to contain Russia's growing capabilities."" He described it as a historical pattern the West repeats ""whenever someone thinks that Russia has become too strong or independent."" For now, the strategy, which includes suppressing any critical media and quieting critics, is working. Polls show Putin's approval ratings at stratospheric levels. But that was before the price of oil collapsed and the ruble went into a downward spiral. Even if he can keep strong popular support, Putin has to worry most of all about keeping happy the oligarchs, the wealthy Russians who back him in exchange for continued prosperity. Economic sanctions and a shrinking economy will not make them happy. The severity of the current crisis became apparent by Tuesday. The ruble had lost nearly 20% in just one day. So the Central Bank, Russia's version of the Federal Reserve, held an emergency meeting and raised interest rates to 17% from 10.5%. The move was meant to strengthen the ruble, to keep people from selling. Wealthy Russians have taken more than $125 billion out of the country, and slashed oil earnings mean there are less export earnings to convert into rubles. The rate hike hasn't appeared to work. But even if it does, that neck-snapping hike will make it hard for the economy to breathe. Once again, the Russia people will go through wrenching economic hardship because their leaders are following foolish, grandiose policies. Only recently authorities had predicted a mild recession for next year. That is all changing now. Instead of the original government forecast of a 0.8% decline, the Central Bank said that if oil stays under $60 a barrel, the economy could contract more than 4.5%. That is a deep and painful recession. Living standards are now sure to slide. For Putin, strong oil and gas export earnings have provided political power. Popularity came from rising living standards. It was less than a year ago when, flush with cash, Putin staged his triumphant Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. He spent $50 billion to dazzle the world and show the Russia people that under his leadership Russia was a global power. But before the Olympic flame flickered out fires were already raging in Ukraine. Then came the invasion of Crimea, economic sanctions, and now this, the most painful cut of oil. Sanctions, which were meant to loosen Putin's grip on eastern Ukraine, are now not the main problem for the Russian leader. If he relented to Western demands, he would still have a recession on his hands. A cornered Putin could prove dangerous, as Russia's neighbors know well. Sweden's defense minister went on TV a few days ago to announce new military readiness measures in response to Russia's military maneuvers. The Baltic states, whose NATO membership commits the United States and others to intervene in their defense, worry Russia may make a move in their territory. Russian agents captured an Estonian official a few months ago. The Baltics -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- have fresh memories of being annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. Moscow's military muscle-flexing has not been limited to border states. Britain's Royal Air Force has intercepted several Russian bombers as they neared UK airspace. Norway, too, has intercepted Russian bombers. NATO says it has intercepted more than 100 Russian aircraft since the crisis over Ukraine started. Would Putin start a new military crisis to fuel nationalistic fervor and thus protect himself from the backlash of economic troubles at home? Recent rhetoric indicates that would be a preferred tactic. But polls show the Russian people are wavering. Russian support for a military presence in Ukraine has dropped from 74% to 23%, according to The Economist. That's the first sign of a majority of Russians doubting, if not in any way turning against their President for now. Putin has no good, easy choices. That should give the rest of the world reason to be nervous.","The ruble dropped nearly 20% in one day, signaling an economic crisis for Russia .

"Explosions rocked the Syrian capital early Friday, hours before U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets with her Russian counterpart to raise pressure on the crisis in the Middle East nation. Clinton meets Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in St. Petersburg amid their nations' deep divisions over Syria. Their meeting is expected to include a discussion of Russian arm sales to the Syrian regime. Clinton will attend Saturday's emergency meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, led by Kofi Annan, the United Nations' and Arab League's special envoy for Syria. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he hopes the meeting marks a ""turning point"" in diplomatic efforts. The United States has advocated a political transition plan in Syria. Russia has opposed the idea that other countries dictate a political transition, insisting that it is a decision for the Syrians themselves. But Lavrov said in Moscow that a transitional period is ""necessary for settling the Syrian crisis and establishing stable and generally acceptable rules and norms, which will satisfy all the Syrian groups."" As diplomats prepared for the weekend talks, violence continued Thursday across Syria. Massive explosions shook the heart of Damascus near the Justice Ministry, state-run media said. Two blasts occurred in a parking lot Thursday outside the Palace of Justice, which houses the ministry, Syrian state TV said. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said it occurred in the Marja neighborhood of central Damascus. At least three people were injured, and 20 cars were damaged, state TV said. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 140 people, 46 of them government forces, died in violence Thursday. The Local Coordination Committees put the number at 139, but it counts only civilians and soldiers who defected. Both opposition groups said many of the deaths occurred in Damascus suburbs, mostly in the town of Douma, and in Homs. CNN cannot independently confirm the reports of casualties or violence because access by international journalists to Syria has been severely restricted. State media said an armed terrorist group assassinated a doctor and several members of her family in a Homs suburb. It said that ""competent authorities"" fought the group, killing 10 and injuring 20. On Wednesday, bombers killed at least seven people in the headquarters of the al-Ikhbaria television station near Damascus, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Three journalists and four security guards died, and the attackers ransacked and destroyed studios, the news outlet said. There has been a flurry of attacks in Syria's major cities of Damascus and Aleppo in recent months, strikes that opposition groups have said the government has orchestrated to discredit anti-regime forces. President Bashar al-Assad's regime has blamed the attacks on terrorists. ""Terrorist operations of this nature could not be implemented without adequate financing and support in terms of providing money, weapons or persons or through media and political coverage,"" Bashar Jaafari, Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday. After more than 15 months, unrest in the Arab nation shows no sign of abating. Internationally, tension rose last week after Syria shot down a Turkish jet, an act deplored by NATO and many Western nations. The Geneva meeting will bring together top diplomats of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States -- and Turkey. Envoys from the United Nations, the European Union and the Arab League also were invited. The meeting of the group, dubbed the Action Group for Syria, comes at a critical time for the country, which has been mired in an uprising since March 2011 that has pitted al-Assad's forces against rebels calling for his ouster. A peace plan hammered out by Annan fell apart this month after both sides -- the Syrian government and the rebels -- accused the other of failing to abide by the terms to end the killing. Iran has not been invited to the meeting. The United States was against Tehran's presence despite Annan's and Russia's positions that Iran must be involved in helping forge peace in Syria. Lavrov says Iran is an ""influential player in this situation,"" and it's a ""great mistake"" to exclude that country. ""It has been said publicly in Washington that the U.S. is categorically against Iran's participation,"" Lavrov said. ""This is a manifestation of a double standard. When the Americans needed to settle some issues related to the security of their troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, they initiated contacts with Iran and agreed on something without any hesitations."" Annan also declined to invite Saudi Arabia, which backs the opposition. Russia did not want Saudi Arabia at the meeting. Russia has been under pressure to stop providing arms to the Syrian regime. A shipment of refurbished Russian helicopters headed for Syria had to turn around and return to Russia after its British insurance company dropped coverage on the ship carrying the aircraft. Russia and China, permanent members of the Security Council, have major trade deals with Syria. Both countries vetoed a U.N. resolution calling for an end to the violence and a transition of power.

"(CNN) -- The Netherlands and Nigeria will begin using body scanners on airline passengers following the attempted terrorist attack on a U.S.-bound flight on Christmas Day, authorities in both nations said Wednesday. The millimeter-wave body scanners will be in place at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport in about three weeks and will be used on all passengers traveling to the United States, Dutch Interior Minister Guusje ter Horst told a news conference at The Hague. ""We've escaped a very serious attack with serious consequences, but unfortunately in this world there are individuals who do not shy away from attacks on innocent people,"" she said. Nigeria did not say when it would begin the new scans.  ""In combating the new threat of terrorism as unfolded recently, Nigeria will be upgrading its security screening system to 3D Total Body Imaging Scanner,"" the country's airport authority said in a statement. It gave no further details. Do new rules make you feel safer? Share your airport experiences. Nigerian suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, 23, is accused of trying to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane going from Amsterdam to Detroit, Michigan, with explosives that had been concealed in his underwear. He is charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft. The militant group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the December 25 plot. Dutch authorities have already said they were confident in the security measures that were carried out when AbdulMutallab transferred to the Detroit flight from an earlier flight from Nigeria. A source in Lagos, Nigeria, with connections to the aviation industry told CNN that AbdulMullatab arrived in Nigeria from Accra, Ghana, on December 24. He flew in on a Virgin Nigeria flight, arriving in Lagos about 7:30 p.m. local time (1:30 p.m. ET), about an hour before he checked in for a KLM flight to Amsterdam. He checked one bag, the source said. Ter Horst said that security measures in place in Amsterdam were metal detectors and X-ray machines, and admitted they could not have picked up the explosive material that AbdulMullatab was allegedly carrying. ""The introduction of these body scanners would certainly have helped in detecting that he was carrying something on his body,"" she said. ""We know that metal detection does not help to detect non-metal explosives, and these millimeter-wave scanners can do this, which would mean that this would be an improvement."" One passenger on same plane as AbdulMutallab told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that the security checks at Schiphol were not as stringent as those she is used to in the United States. ""We walked through and did not have to take our shoes off,"" said Wisconsin native Richelle Keepman. ""Also, my mother had a water bottle in her bag that she'd completely forgotten about. And it went right through and we didn't realize it until we were on the plane."" Ter Horst acknowledged that the systems currently in place are ""not watertight,"" which is why the body scanners are being introduced. As to privacy concerns -- namely that the scanners could pick up private features of a person's body -- ter Horst said the scan results would first go through a computer, which would then flag any suspicious items to a human. The scanners will be permanent at Schiphol, and any passengers bound for the United States who do not go through them will be body-searched, ter Horst said. Erik Akerboom, the Dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism, said part of the investigation is looking at whether the explosives were brought into Schiphol by someone else for AbdulMutallab to pick up later. Dutch authorities are also looking into whom he was in touch with while at Schiphol awaiting his connecting flight. They are combing surveillance camera footage from the connections hall, Akerboom said. Asked about reports that AbdulMutallab paid for his ticket in cash and was flying only with hand luggage, Akerboom said neither would have necessarily raised any alarms. ""There are several travelers who do this,"" he said. AbdulMutallab's name had come to the attention of U.S. authorities before the attack, sources have told CNN in recent days. His father talked twice about his son's extremist views with at least one CIA representative at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and a report was prepared, but the report was not circulated outside the agency, a reliable source told CNN's Jeanne Meserve on Tuesday. Had that critical information been shared, the man might have been denied passage on the flight, the source said. A U.S. intelligence official said AbdulMutallab's name, passport number and possible connection to extremists were indeed disseminated. But the official added, ""I'm not aware of a magic piece of intelligence -- somehow withheld -- that would have put AbdulMutallab on the no-fly list."" CIA spokesman George Little defended the agency's actions regarding AbdulMutallab, but also said the agency is reviewing data to ascertain whether more could have been done. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said department staff did what they were supposed to by sending a cable to the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington about the matter. Kelly said any decision to revoke the suspect's visa would have been an interagency decision. Ter Horst said Dutch authorities did not know that AbdulMutallab had raised any security flags, and she called for a global watch list for all suspect travelers in the future.","Nigeria announces intent to use security technology; no timeline given .

Cannon, 47, faces federal charges of theft and bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds, honest services wire fraud and extortion under color of official right, according to a press release from U.S. Attorney Anne Tompkins of western North Carolina. The Charlotte mayor's office declined a CNN request for comment. However, CNN obtained a copy of Cannon's resignation letter, sent to City of Charlotte Manager Ron Carlee and City Attorney Bob Hagemann. ""I hereby give notice of my resignation from the position of the Mayor of the City of Charlotte, effective immediately. In light of the charges that have been brought against me, it is my judgment that the pendency of these charges will create too much of a distraction for the business of the City to go forward smoothly and without interruption,"" Cannon wrote in the letter. ""I regret that I have to take this action, but I believe that it is in the best interest of the City for me to do so."" First elected to City Council in 1993 -- when he was 26 and two years removed from graduating from North Carolina A&T State University -- the Democrat served through 2005, including the last four years as mayor pro tem. Cannon, the president of a private parking business, spent four years out of office until being elected to City Council again in 2009. Between 2010 and 2013, he served as both a council member and mayor pro tem until his election as mayor in November 2013. Federal authorities launched their corruption investigation in August 2010, using FBI agents who posed as commercial real estate developers and investors looking to do business in the North Carolina city, Tompkins' office said. Investigators documented five separate occasions between January 2013 and February 2014 in which Cannon allegedly took more than $48,000 in cash, airline tickets, a hotel room and a luxury apartment from the undercover agents. In the last instance, authorities say Cannon got $20,000 in cash in the mayor's office. He allegedly accepted the largesse in exchange for returning the favor using his powers as a City Council member, mayor pro tem and, eventually, mayor. Cannon appeared in court Wednesday and was released on bond, the U.S. attorney's office reported. If convicted on all charges, he could be sentenced to as many as 50 years in federal prison and pay as much as $1.5 million in fines, officials said.

"(CNN) -- A policeman and a former corrections officer say that on Friday they will unveil evidence of what they claim is their biggest find ever: the body of Bigfoot. The thawed body of a creature reputed to be Bigfoot reportedly weighs more than 500 pounds. Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, a pair of Bigfoot-hunting hobbyists from north Georgia, say they found the creature's body in a wooded area and spotted several similar creatures that were still alive. The carcass of the furry half-man, half-ape is 7 feet, 7 inches tall and weighs more than 500 pounds, they say. However, the two are not disclosing the exact location of their discovery to protect the remaining creatures. Tom Nelson, chairman of the biology department at North Georgia College and State University in Dahlonega, said he's ""pretty skeptical"" the world will feast its eyes on a new species Friday. ""That would certainly rock mammalogy,"" joked Nelson, who specializes in the study of mammals. ""I see a research grant in my future."" Whitton and Dyer plan to unveil what they say is DNA and photo evidence of the discovery in Palo Alto, California, in conjunction with a group called Searching for Bigfoot Inc. A photograph on that group's Web site shows what appears to be the body of a large, hairy creature with an ape-like face, stuffed into a large freezer. According to a written release, the two announced the discovery on an Internet radio show, ""Squatch Detective,"" several weeks ago. iReport.com: Do you believe in Bigfoot? ""The only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was 'the Real Bigfoot Hunter,' Tom Biscardi,"" Dyer said, referring to Searching for Bigfoot's CEO, who has been looking for the elusive, legendary creature in the United States and Canada since 1971. Whitton is a Georgia police officer who is on administrative leave after being shot in the wrist during a pursuit. Dyer is a former prison guard. DNA tests on the body have begun, said the statement, and ""extensive scientific studies"" will be done on the body by scientists, including a molecular biologist, an anthropologist and a paleontologist. Nelson, the university professor, acknowledged that new species of animals have been discovered in recent decades and that, in science, ""we always acknowledge the possibility of something new."" But he said that even in north Georgia, home to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the foot of the Appalachian Trail, it stretches the imagination to think a family of 7-foot-tall creatures could have eluded hunters, hikers and creeping development until now. ""To the average person, these places just seem like extreme wilderness where you'll find lions and tigers and bears,"" he said. ""The reality is that you're never more than a mile from a road."" The group says the animal is male, has reddish hair and ""blackish-gray"" eyes and human-like feet, hands and teeth. CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","North Georgia men say they've found a den of Bigfoot creatures .

"In a lush field outside Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar, the face of a little girl stares up at the clouds, her eyes searching for the whirring machines that destroyed her family. Her face -- a picture of innocence -- adorns a giant poster that has been printed out by a group of artist-activists in Pakistan as part of a project, known as #NotABugSplat, to humanize victims of the controversial U.S. drone program in Pakistan's restive tribal region. According to one artist, who identified himself as R, the project is a reaction to the dehumanizing nature of drone warfare, where operators preside over deadly missile attacks from thousands of miles away, coining terms such as ""bug splat"" to describe victims of these strikes because ""viewing the (dead) body through a grainy video image gives the sense of an insect being crushed."" ""We want to shame drone operators and make them realize the human cost of their actions,"" said R. Sharing untold stories . The artists' work is inspired by ""Inside Out,"" a global art project by renowned French photographer JR that uses photographic portraits to share the untold stories and images of people in their communities. Six months ago, the team behind #NotABugSplat contacted UK-based legal charity Reprive, which has been working with prominent lawyer Shehzad Akbar to investigate the human cost of drone strikes in Pakistan. It was Akbar who gave the #NotABugSplat team the image of a girl who had lost her parents to a drone strike in 2010 in the North Waziristan village of Dande Darpa Khel. According to Akbar, the strike led to the destruction of several mud homes housing Afghan refugees, and the victims had been mainly women and children. The photograph was taken by Noor Behram, a photojournalist based in North Waziristan. The name of the child and her actual location is unknown, lost in the nameless surge of refugees that populate this conflict-torn region of Pakistan. Permanent part of landscape . #NotABugSplat said they laid out her image in the field long enough for it to be ""captured by satellites in order to make it a permanent part of the landscape on online mapping sites."" They had originally wanted to take the poster to Waziristan, where most drone strikes actually take place. But a lack of access due to ongoing operations by security forces meant the poster was laid out in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead. Though there has not been a confirmed drone strike in Pakistan since December 2013, #NotABugSplat wants to continue to put up more posters of children to instigate further dialogue and awareness, because as R puts it, ""it is only the loss of a child that can show the impact that drone strikes have on the residents of these regions."" Drone strikes in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan have drawn heated opposition in Pakistan because of civilian casualties. The drone strikes have further roiled relations between the two nations, which flared following a 2011 raid by U.S. commandos on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. According to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 383 U.S. drone strikes have been reported in Pakistan since 2004 with the death toll estimated to be between 2,296 and 3,718.","#NotABugSplat project set up to humanize victims of drone warfare in Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has canceled this week's scheduled meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, Israeli government officials said Monday. The two leaders were slated to meet Tuesday during a visit by Netanyahu to Washington. Netanyahu also decided to cut short a visit to Canada and return to Israel, according to an e-mail statement from his media adviser. Netanyahu's cancellation of the meeting came in the wake of international condemnation of Israel after Israeli soldiers stormed a flotilla of ships carrying aid intended for Palestinians in Gaza, leaving at least nine people dead in the resulting violence. Israel claimed it was defending itself, with the Israel Defense Forces saying the soldiers' lives were in danger after they were attacked with ""severe physical violence, including live fire, weapons, knives and clubs."" Several nations, however, have condemned the military action and called for an investigation. Q&A on Israel's Gaza blockade . Obama spoke on the phone with Netanyahu Monday morning, according to a statement from the White House press office. He ""said he understood the prime minister's decision to return immediately to Israel to deal with today's events ... (and) agreed to reschedule their meeting at the first opportunity."" Obama ""expressed deep regret at the loss of life in today's incident, and concern for the wounded,"" the statement noted. He ""also expressed the importance of learning all the facts and circumstances around this morning's tragic events as soon as possible."" Netanyahu and Obama were set to discuss, among other things, the recently completed U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, according to an earlier statement from the Israeli government. The final document released by participants in the month-long conference, which ended Friday, called for a 2012 conference of all Middle Eastern states to move forward on a 1995 proposal for a nuclear-free Mideast. The document also called on Israel to sign the treaty and place ""all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safeguards."" Israel is not a member of the NPT and has neither confirmed nor denied that it has a nuclear weapons stockpile. The Israeli government said in a statement the conference's document is ""deeply flawed and hypocritical"" and said it ""ignores the realities of the Middle East and the real threats facing the region and the entire world."" The statement also complained that Israel is singled out in the document and Iran, which is a signatory to the NPT, is not mentioned. The United States signed onto the document, but Obama National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones said the U.S. government has ""serious reservations.""","NEW: Obama spoke by phone with Netanyahu, saying he understands the decision to cancel the meeting .

"Editor's note: Andrew J. Imparato is chief executive of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), a national nonprofit, nonpartisan membership organization of people with disabilities, their family members and supporters that was founded in 1995. Andrew J. Imparato says Kennedy's family experience helped drive his commitment to disability rights. (CNN) -- The disability rights movement has lost a giant in our global struggle for equal opportunity, human dignity and self-determination. Sen. Ted Kennedy's leadership as a disability champion was part of a broader commitment to civil and human rights. But his accomplishments in the area of disability law and policy may prove to be his greatest and most long-lasting success as a legislator. Senator Kennedy's commitment to the cause of disability rights was informed by his experience as the brother of Rosemary, who was born with an intellectual disability; and the brother of Eunice, who devoted her life to improving the world's treatment of people with intellectual disabilities. It was deepened when his son Ted Jr. had his leg amputated at age 12 after being diagnosed with bone cancer; and deepened again when his son Patrick experienced bipolar disorder and substance abuse as an adult. Senator Kennedy understood disability as a human issue because he had a front-row seat from which to witness society's all-too-often callous and bigoted treatment of children and adults with disabilities. In his heart of hearts, Senator Kennedy understood that America was at its best when it expanded opportunities for people with all types of disabilities, for women, for immigrants, for racial and ethnic minorities, for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people, for infants and children and for seniors. He was able to couple this understanding and commitment with a knack for finding Republican and moderate Democrat partners and working out legislation that could pass with enormous bipartisan support. When the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) passed in 1990, the vote in the Senate was 91-6. That vote was the product of hours of cajoling and negotiating between Senator Kennedy, his Democratic allies Tom Harkin and Steny Hoyer, the George H.W. Bush White House, Senators Bob Dole and Orrin Hatch, and others. The ADA was a once-in-a-lifetime piece of civil rights legislation. Thanks to the ADA, the U.S. demonstrated to the world that it was possible to mandate that buses, telecommunications, buildings and schools be accessible. Our country showed the world that it is possible to outlaw discrimination in employment against people with disabilities without harming businesses. The example of the ADA helped more than 70 foreign countries pass similar legislation, and laid the foundation for the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is driving even more change globally as the 65 countries who have signed and ratified the convention seek to pass implementing legislation. Senator Kennedy's legacy extends from the ADA to so many other critical bills: the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, which added disability to the group of protected classes under that critical law; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which outlaws discrimination and guarantees a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities; the Family Opportunity Act, which gives parents of disabled children the ability to purchase Medicaid coverage for their children even if they were not low-income; the Help America Vote Act, which requires every polling place to have a machine where disabled people could vote privately and independently; and the more recent Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act and mental health parity legislation. As an attorney with bipolar disorder who graduated from law school in 1990, I am one of a generation of professionals who have developed our careers in the wake of the ADA and other critical laws that protect our right to equal opportunity and fairness. I have personally benefited from Senator Kennedy's leadership. I have had the privilege of working closely with his extraordinary sons Ted and Patrick and with his top notch staff. I cannot imagine a more effective champion for disability rights, for civil rights, for health care, for basic human decency, than Edward M. Kennedy. His legacy will be felt by more than 600 million children and adults with disabilities around the world for generations to come. We have lost a champion, and we must all work harder to continue to make progress toward his compelling vision of a world where all people have value, all people have dignity, and all people can participate as equals in the lives of their communities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew J. Imparato.","Andrew Imparato: Kennedy's family helped spark interest in disability rights .

"(CNN) -- Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann formally announced her candidacy for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination Monday during an appearance in Waterloo, Iowa -- the city where she was born. Bachmann, a 55-year-old Tea Party favorite currently serving her third term in the House, told a crowd of supporters that Barack Obama's presidency has been a failure. She promised to lead a new conservative revolution characterized by smaller government and a lower federal debt. ""Make no mistake about it: President Obama is a one-term president,"" Bachmann declared. ""Together we can rein in all the corruption and waste that has become Washington and instead leave a better America for future generations."" Bachmann blasted Obama's controversial 2009 economic stimulus plan, telling the crowd that ""spending our way out of this recession hasn't worked."" Echoing Ronald Reagan's famous refrain, the congresswoman asserted that ""more than ever, Washington is the problem."" ""The real solutions will come from our businesses, our communities, our schools and the most basic and powerful unit of all -- our families,"" she proclaimed. While making a direct appeal to the Tea Party's deficit hardliners, Bachmann also made a pitch to religious conservatives, praising the country's past military victories in part by citing a line from the Bible: ""Greater love hath no man than this, but that he lay down his life for his friend."" Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt dismissed Bachmann's claim she could lead a new economic recovery, arguing that ""her policies would erode the path to prosperity for middle class families."" Most political analysts consider Bachmann's candidacy for the GOP nomination a long shot at best, as front-runner Mitt Romney cranks up a formidable campaign operation and fundraising machine. Few House members have proven to be nationally viable candidates in the past. On Sunday, Fox News Channel's Chris Wallace asked Bachmann if she's a ""flake"" -- a question the congresswoman said she found insulting. Wallace later apologized. Regardless, Bachmann appears to have considerable appeal among Republicans in Iowa, which will host the nation's first caucuses next winter. She finished a statistically insignificant one point behind Romney in a Des Moines Register Iowa poll released Saturday night. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor and familiar face from his 2008 bid, was favored by 23% of the likely Iowa caucus-goers, while Bachmann was favored by 22% of respondents. Former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain -- like Bachmann, a Tea Party favorite -- received 10%, while former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas each got 7%. Bachmann, according to a number of observers, is believed to be banking on heavy support among Iowa's influential evangelical voters to give her a breakthrough victory in Iowa and establish her as the main GOP alternative to Romney, who is still struggling to overcome skepticism among conservatives. To help accomplish that task, Bachmann has assembled a team of veteran political operatives. Among others, she hired Ed Rollins, who directed Reagan's landslide re-election bid in 1984 and managed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's 2008 effort, to run her operation. She has also brought in top-flight Republican talent like pollster Ed Goeas, who was working with Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour before Barbour decided not to seek the nomination. The congresswoman has also brought on board message maven Brett O'Donnell, who worked for President George W. Bush and for Sen. John McCain's 2008 campaign. O'Donnell coached McCain running mate Sarah Palin before her high-stakes vice-presidential debate. Also aiding Bachmann are veteran consultant Bob Heckman, who has deep ties to the conservative movement; former McCain campaign web guru Becki Donatelli; and Tom McGill, a fundraiser for Bush's 2004 campaign and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's 2008 bid. Asked about the steep challenge ahead, Bachmann boasted Sunday that she has a ""titanium spine for doing what we need to do."" She also stressed her sincerity -- a characteristic supporters hope will allow the congresswoman to draw a stark contrast with Romney, who is accused of being a politically opportunistic flip-flopper on abortion and other key issues. ""What people know about me is I do what I say and I say what I mean,"" Bachmann said on Fox. ""I think people recognize I'm very sincere in what I say."" Bachmann, who backs deep spending cuts to balance the federal budget, became defensive when asked Sunday about a Los Angeles Times report on federal money that benefited her family -- including nearly $30,000 for a counseling clinic operated by her husband and almost $260,000 for a family farm. The money didn't directly benefit her family, she explained, saying the $30,000 was for training employees, and the farm that got the $260,000 was owned by her father-in-law, so she and her husband didn't get any of it. Asked about another hot-button issue -- same-sex marriage -- Bachmann said she supported both the right of states to pass laws on the matter and the superseding authority of a federal constitutional amendment on the issue. Bachmann said New York's state legislature and governor have the right under the Tenth Amendment to legalize gay marriage, which they did Friday night and early Saturday. But, Bachmann added, she also backs a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a man and a woman. In the end, Bachmann said, it would be better to settle the matter with citizens voting on a constitutional amendment rather than Supreme Court justices issuing a decision. Asked on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" whether she believes homosexuality is a choice, Bachmann said it was up to individuals to make their own decision and that she wasn't judging anyone on the issue. She described herself as a Christian who gets guidance in her life and political career through prayer. She also challenged the widespread assertion -- backed by the White House, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and a host of economic analysts -- that a failure to raise the current $14.3 trillion federal debt ceiling by August 2 would have potentially dangerous economic consequences. ""It is scare tactics,"" Bachmann said, adding that the government takes in plenty of money to pay the interest it owes on federal debt and avoid default. In that case, she conceded, other spending such as funding for the military would have to be cut. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Tom Cohen, and Peter Hamby contributed to this report .","Rep.

"(CNN) -- A gunshot struck the home of CNN anchor Lou Dobbs this month, and police in New Jersey are trying to determine whether the bullet was fired intentionally or was a stray. State Police Sgt. Steve Jones said Thursday that his department received a call from Dobbs' wife, who heard a shot and said a bullet hit her house. Jones said she had been outside her house with ""an employee who worked with Dobbs"" at 10:25 a.m. October 5. There were no injuries in the incident, which occurred in a small community in northern New Jersey. Jones said a bullet struck the section of the house where the attic is but didn't penetrate the dwelling. He said the bullet fell to the ground and was recovered. Dobbs' wife saw damage to the siding, Jones said. ""The bullet was taken by our detectives and turned over to our ballistics unit for further analysis,"" Jones said. ""At this point, all I can say is that it appears to be a long gun, not a handgun or shotgun."" Dobbs has declined comment because the police investigation is ongoing, his representative said. Dobbs, who has been a vocal critic of illegal immigration, is the anchor and managing editor of CNN's ""Lou Dobbs Tonight."" He mentioned the incident on his radio show Monday, saying it comes amid an ""atmosphere"" of hostility from groups toward his stance on illegal immigration. On the radio show, aired by United Stations Radio Networks, Dobbs said that ""a shot was fired at my house where I live"" and that it followed ""weeks and weeks of threatening phone calls."" He said the hostility has ""become part of a way of life, the anger, the hate, the vitriol, but it's taken a different tone where they threaten my wife."" ""They've now fired a shot at my house while my wife was standing next to the car. It's become something else, and if anybody thinks that we're not engaged in a battle for the soul of this country right now, you're sorely mistaken."" Police aren't saying for now that the shot was fired at the house but only, as Jones said, that it struck the house. A stray shot from a long gun would not be a ""totally uncommon occurrence because of the hunters and target shooters"" in the region, Jones said. Jones couldn't give his opinion on what kind of shooting this might be, and he said the incident is being investigated ""further past a stray hunter's bullet"" because of Dobbs' ""public persona."" Police have conducted interviews and patrolled the area, Jones said. When asked whether police would refer the case to federal authorities if it turned out to be an attack, Jones said, ""state police work regularly with other officers at local, county and federal levels and draw on any of resources when appropriate."" ""The case remains open,"" he said. ""We want to take any incident like this seriously.""","New Jersey officials unsure whether bullet was intentionally fired or a stray .

"Eric Garner's final words have become a rallying call for protesters across the country. In the days following a grand jury decision not to indict New York police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner's chokehold death, demonstrators in New York City and beyond took to the streets demanding justice, chanting ""I can't breathe"" -- a reference to Garner's last utterance. A police officer and small business owner in Indiana is hoping to change the conversation around police-community relations. Jason Barthel, an officer with the Mishawaka Police Department and the owner of South Bend Uniform Company, is selling a T-shirt that reads ""Breathe Easy, Don't Break the Law."" The shirt is emblazoned with a graphic of a police officer's badge. Barthel said the shirt is meant to bring people together and remind communities that police officers are there to serve and protect -- not to harm. ""When we use the slogan 'Breathe Easy' we are referring to knowing the police are there for you!  The police are here to protect and serve,"" Barthel wrote on Facebook.  ""99.9% of us have the greater good in our hearts each time we strap on our uniforms and duty belts."" Not everyone agrees with his reasoning. Many have taken to his company's Facebook page to criticize the shirt's reference to Garner and the controversy surrounding his death. ""This shirt shows great disrespect to the family of Eric (Garner), and all victims of police misconduct. Please reconsider its production,"" wrote one commenter. ""As a marketer you know using a reference to that will sell. It is poor taste, and inflammatory. How does this help in any way relations between police and community?"" wrote another. Barthel maintains that the shirt is ""by no means is a slam on Eric Garner or his family"" and that ""we are one people, one nation regardless of race, religion, creed or gender."" The shirt sells for $7.95 online, where a banner advertising the shirt reads ""Make a Statement."" Barthel told CNN affiliate WSBT that he has already received over 100 orders and that phones have been ringing nonstop. Garner's death was later ruled a homicide by the New York City medical examiner.  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced earlier this month that federal officials were moving ahead with a civil rights investigation.

"PYONGYANG, North Korea (CNN) -- North Korea on Friday destroyed a water cooling tower at a facility where officials acknowledge they extracted plutonium to build nuclear weapons, CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour reported from the scene. The cooling tower is demolished at the Yongbyon nuclear complex near Pyongyang, North Korea. The massive implosion, which came at about 5pm local time Friday at the Yongbyon facility, was intended to be a powerful public symbol of a move to end nuclear activities by the Communist nation once branded a member of an ""axis of evil"" by U.S. President George W. Bush. The destruction of the highly visible symbol of North Korea's long-secret nuclear program came just a day after the country released details of its program. ""They fired a warning flare and then in three minutes the whole thing came tumbling down in a massive cloud of smoke,"" Amanpour said.  Watch Amanpour's report from the scene. » . ""There was a moment of stunned silence as the magnitude of what had happened sunk in,"" Amanpour said. U.S. State Department officials and observers from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) watched from a reviewing stand on a ridge about 1,000 yards away, she said. ""This is a very significant disablement step,"" the U.S. envoy to North Korea, Sung Kim, said. Nuclear experts say that the plant's destroyed central water-cooling tower would take a year or longer to rebuild if North Korea were to try using the plant again. ""This is a critical piece of equipment for the nuclear reactor,"" said analyst John Wolfsthal, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has been following North Korea since the 1980s. ""Without this facility, the reactor can't operate and can't produce more plutonium for weapons.""  Watch the tower being demolished » . North Korea has been dismantling other parts of the facility under the watchful eyes of representatives of the five other nations, including the U.S., that have been involved in six-party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. On Thursday, North Korean officials turned over to China a 60-page declaration, written in English, that details several rounds of plutonium production at the Yongbyon plant dating back to 1986.  Watch President Bush claim progress over the N. Korea nuclear issue » . In it, North Korea acknowledges producing roughly 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. In response, Bush said he would lift some U.S. sanctions against North Korea and remove the country from the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism. But he made clear that other sanctions remained in place on North Korea -- which has been on the terrorism list since its alleged involvement in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner which killed 115 people. ""The United States has no illusions about the regime in Pyongyang,"" Bush said. ""We remain deeply concerned about North Korea's human rights abuses, uranium enrichment activities, nuclear testing and proliferation, ballistic missile programs and the threat it continues to pose to South Korea and its neighbors."" U.S. analysts will pore over the document to resolve Washington's outstanding concerns, which include questions about the extent of North Korea's proliferation of nuclear technology and the status of any uranium enrichment program.  Watch what's still unknown after Pyongyang's declaration » . Friday's event at the nuclear plant marked at least an effort by North Korea -- dubbed ""The Hermit Kingdom"" in the international community for its isolationist tendencies -- to show the world a good-faith effort to end its nuclear weapons program. Media outlets from the five other nations involved in the talks were invited to view the tower's implosion, a rare move in North Korea. CNN was among the media outlets present. But there appeared to be no mention of the declaration or planned implosion at Yongbyon on the Web site of North Korea's state-run news agency on Thursday. And an article Wednesday noted the 58th anniversary of the Korean war, calling it ""a war of aggression started by the U.S. imperialists in an attempt to occupy the whole of Korea.""

"It's always a question: Will the Academy Awards telecast feature performances of the Original Song nominees? Sometimes the answer is no, but this time ... it's looking like a yes. Producers have indicated  the frontrunner in that category, Adele's massively popular theme to the James Bond thriller Skyfall, will be performed live during the Feb. 24 ceremony. While the other nominees weren't mentioned in the announcement, it's unlikely one nominee will be allowed to perform unless the other contenders are welcome too — especially since one of them is written by Oscar host Seth MacFarlane and another could be performed by Hugh Jackman. Academy Awards producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron confirmed Adele's participation this morning: ""She is currently one of the most successful recording artists in the world, and we believe that her performance of Skyfall will be an exciting Oscar moment for audiences watching at the Dolby Theatre and on television screens around the world."" EW special coverage: Oscars 2013 . The song is the first 007 theme to be nominated for an Oscar since 1981′s For Your Eyes Only. Previous Bond movies to have song nominees are 1977′s The Spy Who Loved Me and 1973′s Live and Let Die, although none has ever won. This ceremony will feature a special tribute to James Bond, as part of the super-spy film series' 50th anniversary, and Skyfall also has four other nominations: cinematography, score, sound editing, and sound mixing. The Oscars will mark the first time Adele, who co-wrote the Skyfall theme with collaborator Paul Epworth, has ever performed the song live. ""It's an honour to be nominated and terrifyingly wonderful to be singing in front of people who have captured my imagination over and over again,"" Adele said in a statement. ""It's something I've never experienced and probably only ever will once!"" Although MacFarlane is nominated as one of the co-writers of Everybody Needs a Friend from Ted, it was performed by Norah Jones — another potential draw for audiences.

"Joequetta Lewis got to hold her newborn son for 53 days. ""And then the next day,"" she said, ""he was gone."" Rayshawn Lewis-Smith was one of five babies known to have died within 11 months of undergoing heart surgery at Kentucky Children's Hospital in Lexington -- surgeries that, nationally, babies usually survive. ""He was born, and he looked as healthy as any of my other children,"" said Sarah Moore, whose son Jaxon was the first to die. ""I held him. And then three weeks later, I was burying him."" Shortly after the fifth death in 2012, Kentucky Children's decided to stop its heart surgeries and placed its only pediatric heart surgeon on leave. At the time, the babies' parents said, they didn't receive any explanation. And today, they're still waiting for answers. ""Something happened,"" Lewis said. ""Can't nobody give me no answers."" But now, pediatric heart surgeries are resuming at Kentucky Children's Hospital -- without any reported investigation by the state health department and without oversight by anyone. There seems to be no medical governing body that needs to sign off on the decision to reopen the heart surgery unit. ""The only person I need permission from is me,"" said Dr. Michael Karpf, executive vice president for health affairs at the University of Kentucky's health care system, which includes Kentucky Children's Hospital. 10 ways to get your child the best heart surgeon . Last year, Karpf said, he put the pediatric heart surgery program on hold because the mortality rates weren't what he wanted them to be. ""They were OK, and OK isn't good enough for me,"" he said at the time. ""It's got to be better. It's got to be good."" Karpf commissioned an internal report (PDF) on the heart surgery program. Parents of the dead babies hoped that might provide them with some information. But the 102-page report doesn't explain why the babies died. In fact, it doesn't acknowledge any deaths at all. ""How do you know when the problems have been fixed when they're not identified?"" asked Kevin Allen, whose daughter Kalyn died in January 2012. ""I mean, they could say they fixed them. But is an internal review really objective?"" Asked in May whether parents should trust that Kentucky Children's would fix any issues before reopening the program, Karpf threw his hands in the air. ""This is America,"" he said. ""You know, they have a choice. They can trust us or not trust us. All I can tell them is, I'm not going to reopen until I feel good about it. It's as simple as that."" A hospital spokesman declined a request for another interview with Karpf, referring questions to a news release about the internal report. CNN reached Karpf this month as he arrived to speak at a community center and asked whether he could give parents some answers about why their children died. ""Unfortunately, babies die at children's hospitals after having heart surgery at other places also,"" he said. ""We explained to you that our mortality (rate) fit the national standards."" Kentucky Children's, however, has been reticent to release statistics on the program, unlike other hospitals that are more transparent. After a legal battle -- which saw the Kentucky attorney general requesting data and the university appealing to a state circuit court -- the hospital released the following number: Patients at Kentucky Children's Hospital were dying after all heart surgeries at the alarming rate of 7.1%. That's more than double the national average of 3.2%. Karpf won't say how well it performed specific heart surgeries on children, information that some hospitals put on their websites. ""We as parents deserve this information,"" said Jennifer Allen, Kalyn's mother. ""I expect nothing more from a health care facility than honest answers. And whether it's good or bad, we should know. I mean, that's not too much to ask."" Parents react to story on Kentucky heart surgeries . Shannon Hall, whose son Mason died, says it's ""scary"" that the hospital is going to be taking pediatric heart patients again. ""It really hurts that they're going to open this program back up,"" Lewis said. ""I'm very scared for the kids. I don't want nobody else to go through this again."" Moore said she's worried about ""the same thing that happened to my baby. ... I never brought my child home. He never left the hospital."" However, Kentucky Children's says it's doing things differently. The surgeon placed on leave has since left, so a new heart surgeon will be hired. The hospital also will dedicate an intensive care unit specifically for heart surgery patients and is considering forming a partnership with another hospital for pediatric heart surgeries. In addition, the hospital says, it will no longer perform the most difficult types of heart surgeries. But that doesn't satisfy the parents still mourning their children. ""Sometimes, you feel like you're alone through it,"" Hall said. ""I don't think that it gets any easier, ever,"" Moore said. ""I've been told my entire life that time heals everything. I don't believe that. I still miss my baby. Every day.""","Kentucky Children's Hospital halted its heart surgeries in 2012 .

"Three people washed off their crippled ship and engulfed by Atlantic waters roiled by Hurricane Sandy scrambled for help on Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard said, but only one of them made it to safety. When the HMS Bounty's crew members realized their lives were in danger off the North Carolina coast in the dark morning hours, they made a short journey they hoped they'd never have to take -- to two waiting life rafts. But only 13 of the 16 people aboard got off the ship safely, initially, and only one of the three washed overboard made it into a raft, Coast Guard Vice Adm. Robert Parker told CNN. That left rescuers scrambling to find them in the frenzied ocean, Parker said. One of them -- the Bounty's longtime captain, Robin Walbridge -- remained missing as night approached Monday, said Lt. Mike Patterson, a Coast Guard spokesman. The body of the second, deckhand Claudene Christian, was found Monday evening, the Coast Guard announced. Crane partially collapses, dangles over New York street . The 180-foot, three-masted ship, a replica of the famous British vessel, foundered about 90 miles off North Carolina as Sandy's fury churned the Atlantic into 18-foot seas, its owner, Bob Hansen, told CNN affilliate KUSA. Hansen said Walbridge was attempting to head east, away from the hurricane, when the ship began taking on water. ""At that time it wasn't considered an emergency, even though they had several feet of water inside the boat,"" Hansen said. ""She's a very large ship, and that little bit of water really does not do anything to her. But somehow we lost power in our generator and in our main engines, and as a result, we could not pump any water out of the boat."" As the waves continued to batter the ship, ""it just got to the point where she couldn't stay afloat anymore."" CNN meteorologists say the water temperature varies greatly in that part of the ocean because of the gulf stream. So the water could be anywhere from 50 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit. All of the crew members were wearing orange survival suits with strobe lights designed to keep them afloat, warm and easy to find. ""But in these conditions, it's very problematic,"" Parker said, adding that a timely deployment of search-and-rescue aircraft and ships gives the missing a chance. A C-130 aircraft and a helicopter have been monitoring the area around the shipwreck. Two Coast Guard cutters were en route to the scene to help with search-and-rescue, with one expected to arrive later on Monday and the other expected on Tuesday, Parker said. Coast Guard helicopters plucked 14 people out of two lifeboats around 6:30 a.m., Petty Officer Brandyn Hill said. ""The first guy we pulled up, he was really happy to see us. That's for sure,"" said Aviation Survival Technician 2 Randy Haba, a Coast Guard rescue swimmer. ""We got him up there, and he was all excited and saying, 'That's a good job,' and everything was great. He was just a little cold, but he was good to go."" The life boats were designed to hold 25 people and had canopies for shelter against pelting rain and winds. All of those rescued arrived at the Coast Guard air station in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and were in good health, Parker said. Initial reports said 17 crew members were aboard, but the Coast Guard later corrected that number. The Coast Guard said it has ""diminished search-and-rescue capabilities"" as Category 1 Hurricane Sandy batters the U.S. East Coast. More sea rescues prompted by Sandy were reported in Delaware Bay. The ship was built for the 1962 film version of ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" starring Marlon Brando, and appeared in the 2006 blockbuster ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."" It was once owned by America's Cup winner and CNN founder Ted Turner, who acquired it in 1986 along with the rights to the MGM film library. ""Among the many troubling reports on the devastating impact of Hurricane Sandy, I am deeply saddened to hear that the HMS Bounty was overtaken by the storm,"" Turner said in a statement Monday night. ""As a sailor and former owner of the Bounty, my heart goes out to the families of the missing crew members, and I am truly hopeful for their safe recovery."" The ship departed New London, Connecticut, for St. Petersburg, Florida, on October 25, according to the ship's Facebook page. Facebook postings bearing that date say things such as ""I'm sure that Hurricane Sandy will be a major consideration when Bounty leaves for St. Petersburg later today,"" and ""Bounty will be sailing East out to sea before heading South to avoid the brunt of Hurricane Sandy."" The ship was scheduled to arrive at the Pier in St. Petersburg as early as November 7 for a public display on November 10 and 11, the Pier's general manager, Carol Everson, said Monday. The St. Petersburg/Clearwater Area Convention and Vistors Bureau is promoting ""The HMS Bounty Returns To The Pier"" on its website. Everson said it's hard to believe the Bounty, which has docked in St. Petersburg for long stretches since the 1970s, is buried under the ocean. Streets turn to rivers, residents trapped in homes . ""It had such a history, not only because of 'Mutiny on the Bounty,' but it's been a great part of St. Petersburg for so many years. It's going to be missed,"" Everson said. ""It had a majestic look with its tall masts. It had an aura about it."" While following the ship's Facebook timeline, you can read a mixture of trepidation and attempts at soothing fears. On Saturday, this post appeared:  ""Bounty's current voyage is a calculated decision... NOT AT ALL... irresponsible or with a lack of foresight as some have suggested. The fact of the matter is... A SHIP IS SAFER AT SEA THAN IN PORT!"" No one responded to the contact e-mail or phone number listed on the ship's website and Facebook account. Sandy is evoking memories of the ""nor'easter"" that struck off New England in 1991 and inspired the best-selling book and movie ""The Perfect Storm."" Ray Leonard, who survived that storm on his sailboat before the Coast Guard rescued him, said being besieged by high winds and waves can be exhausting, but sometimes sailors just have to deal with that physical discomfort. ""You don't really have time to think about much outside, because there's always about six jobs that need doing,"" Leonard said Monday. Leonard said he never felt terribly vulnerable in '91. However, he said, Hurricane Sandy's immensity poses more of a quandary for sailors. ""The one I was in was different, because you could do something. In Sandy, you can't do much,"" Leonard said.

"North Korea appears to be ready to carry out a nuclear test whenever leaders of the reclusive state give the green light, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said Thursday. The comment follows an analysis of recent commercial satellite images by the defense publication IHS Janes, which suggested activity was being ramped up at North Korea's nuclear test site. Mining carts and excavation equipment at the tunneling area of the North's Punggye-ri site can be seen in satellite images taken by Digital Globe and GeoEye in the past month. Earth and debris are being removed from the tunnel in the largest quantities seen so far, according to the Janes assessment. ""Based on the sand piles from the commercial satellites, we are assuming that they have put necessary devices for a nuclear test inside the shaft,"" Kim Min-seok, spokesperson for South Korea's defense ministry said in a regular briefing Thursday. ""This means they can conduct a nuclear test any time."" He said North Korea was ""awaiting a political decision"" on whether or not to go ahead with the test, the prospect of which has  strained relations between Pyongyang and other countries. Many analysts assume an atomic test by North Korea is just a matter of time following the failure of a controversial rocket launch last month. Two previous rocket launches in 2006 and 2009 were followed weeks or months later by nuclear tests. A satellite image from mid-April cited by Janes shows a full mining train, including an engine and several carts, outside of the tunnel at the nuclear site. And a more recent shot on May 9 reveals new road networks at the site along with carts and a vehicle at the facility. Opinion: A nuclear clash could starve the world . North Korea said Tuesday that it would press on with its nuclear program as a response to what it described as hostility from the United States. The top U.S. envoy for North Korea, Glyn Davies, had warned Pyongyang on Monday that a possible third nuclear test would be ""a serious miscalculation and mistake."" An unidentified North Korean Foreign Ministry official suggested that a nuclear test had not originally been part of the regime's plans. ""We did not envisage such a military measure as a nuclear test as we planned to launch a scientific and technical satellite for peaceful purposes,"" he said in a report Tuesday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. But the statement concluded with a vague threat: ""If the U.S. persists in its moves to ratchet up sanctions and pressure upon us despite our peace-loving efforts, we will be left with no option but to take counter-measures for self-defense."" North Korea launched a rocket on April 13, which failed less than two minutes into the flight. It said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology. The move torpedoed a deal reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments from the United States. The rocket launch in April was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder and longtime leader of North Korea. It also came a few months after the death in December of Kim Jong Il, who had headed the secretive regime since 1994. His son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un, has taken over as ""supreme leader"" of the nation, but the level of his influence on policy decisions remains unclear.","An analysis of satellite images shows increased activity at North Korea's nuclear site .

"Almost one year after water for more than 300,000 West Virginia residents was contaminated because of a chemical spill, six former officials for the company responsible for the leak are facing federal charges. Seven-thousand gallons of a toxic chemical called MCHM leaked into the Elk River in West Virginia river on January 9, 1½ miles upstream from a water treatment facility. The Elk River supplies the city of Charleston with water. A do-not-use order was issued to 300,000 residents, some of whom could not drink or bathe in their water for more than a week. The chemical MCHM is commonly used in the coal mining industry for cleaning, and was kept in tanks next to the river by the company Freedom Industries Inc. Several holes were found in the tank that leaked into the river. The Freedom Industries president at the time was Gary Southern, 53, who was indicted on charges of negligent discharge of a pollutant in violation of the Clean Water Act, among other alleged violations. He also faces separate federal charges of wire and bankruptcy fraud. If convicted on all charges, he could face nearly 70 years in prison. Three former owners of Freedom Industries were also indicted. Dennis P. Farrell, 58, William E. Tis, 60, and Charles E. Herzing, 63, were indicted on charges of negligent discharge of a pollutant and negligent discharge of refuse matter. They face up to three years in prison. The indictment for Southern, Farrell, Tis and Herzing alleged that their company failed to make sure the tank holding MCHM was inspected for cracks and to keep it maintained. The indictment alleges that these four men approved funding ""only for those projects that would result in increased business revenue for Freedom, or that were immediately necessary for required equipment maintenance."" Two other men who worked for Freedom Industries at the time -- Michael Burdette and Robert Reynolds -- also face charges that they violated the Clean Water Act. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Department of Justice was committed to vigorously enforcing the Clean Water Act. ""...The conditions at the Freedom Industries facility were not only grievously unacceptable, but unlawful,"" Holder said in the statement. ""They put an entire population needlessly at risk."" An attorney for Southern, Robert Allen, said it was inappropriate for U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia Booth Goodwin to prosecute this case, because he, his colleagues and family were affected by the water contamination. ""If my family's a victim, how can I prosecute somebody for causing that spill or allegedly causing that spill?"" Allen said. ""How can I be fair or impartial?"" Goodwin said he would address Allen's concern ""in due course."" Steve Jory, an attorney for both Tis and Herzing, said they hired experts to make sure the company complied with environmental regulations and were not owners of Freedom Industries at the time of the leak.","Freedom Industries Inc. tank leaked into Elk River a year ago .

"(CNN) -- In the face of Republican opposition, the Senate confirmed President Barack Obama's nominee to be deputy secretary of state Tuesday. Vice President Joe Biden congratulated Tony Blinken on his confirmation. ""Admired in every corner of the world,"" Biden said of Blinken in a tweet that included a picture of the two of them strapped inside an aircraft. Blinken was a member of the Obama-Biden presidential transition team in 2009 and later became Obama's deputy national security adviser. Before his tenure with the administration, where he has become a key player on foreign policy issues, Blinken was a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Opposition to the nomination . Last week, Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Marco Rubio of Florida made it clear at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that they would oppose Blinken's nomination. McCain condemned Blinken for being one of the ""architects"" of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, which McCain believes precipitated the growth of ISIS, the terrorist group that now controls parts of Iraq and Syria. McCain pointed to statements Blinken made then that ""Iraq has never been so prosperous, so powerful, and peaceful as it is today,"" as reason enough for preventing his nomination. Blinken ""was wrong, he was dead wrong, he made many, many statements about Iraq, and unfortunately thousands of people are dead now and parts of Iraq are now controlled by the deadly organization called ISIS,"" said McCain. Rubio said he's opposed to the nomination because Blinken's answers to questions about U.S.-Cuban relations were inadequate. ""I intend, just to be clear and on the record, to use every procedural method available to me to slow down his nomination,"" said Rubio. Democrats disagreed. ""I fully support him,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey. Menendez said Blinken's statements were part and parcel of those of an official who was duty bound to advocate on behalf of that administration. He said one may disagree with the Obama administration's views, but ""that doesn't mean that I necessarily am going to hold that nominee at the end of the day hostage to the administration's view that I disagree with.""

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Former Sen. John Edwards dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination Wednesday, leaving his voters up for grabs. Former Sen. John Edwards ended his presidential bid Wednesday. The race for the Democratic nomination is now down to Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. ""I think both candidates will benefit in the short term, but long-term, the candidate who talks about the plight of the poor, that champions the middle class, that talks about trade and health care ... will benefit from the support of John Edwards and, of course, the people who back him,"" CNN political analyst Donna Brazile said. Senior Edwards aides said Edwards called Clinton and Obama to tell them he was considering dropping out of the race and asked them to make poverty a central issue of the general election and a future Democratic administration, something both agreed to do. Edwards, who had collected 26 delegates, did not plan to endorse Clinton or Obama yet, but he may do so in the future, an aide said.  Watch Edwards explain his decision » . An endorsement from Edwards would have a significant impact on the race,  Democratic strategist Peter Fenn said.  Check out the analysis by CNN's political team » . ""You could make an argument that the change issue does benefit Barack Obama, that he picks up that support. You could also make the argument that there's a lot of support out there amongst people that will go to Hillary,"" he said. ""The big issue here is who will he endorse."" Some political pundits predict Edwards' supporters are more likely to lean in Obama's direction.  Watch analyst Mark Halperin explain endorsement possibilities » . ""The conventional wisdom is that Barack Obama will pick up maybe 60 percent of them, and in some places, that makes a huge difference,"" former presidential adviser David Gergen said. Time magazine journalist Joe Klein said, ""I don't think he endorses Hillary Clinton. The question is whether or not he endorses Barack Obama."" Klein contends Clinton ""represents a lot of the things that [Edwards] campaigned against, you know, the old Washington Democratic establishment that he believes got too close to the corporations in the '90s."" Edwards had campaigned on the message that he was standing up for the little guy, the people who are not traditionally given a voice in Washington, and that he would do more to fight special interests. Edwards announced he was dropping out Wednesday afternoon in New Orleans, the same city where he declared his run for the 2008 Democratic presidential race. ""It is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path,"" he said. With his wife, Elizabeth, and children at his side, Edwards said he couldn't predict ""who will take the final steps to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.,"" but he said it would be a Democrat. ""We must do better if we want to live up to the promise of this country we love so much,"" he said. Earlier, an Edwards aide said the candidate was not getting the media attention he needed to get his message out and win delegates, especially with races coming up in 22 states Tuesday. Campaign money was not an issue, the aide said.  Watch Edwards announce his decision » . Edwards trailed Clinton and Obama in the early contests, including a third-place finish in Tuesday's Florida primary with 14 percent of the votes. He also came in third in key races in New Hampshire and South Carolina. Reacting earlier to Edwards' plans, Obama praised his former rival. ""At a time when our politics is too focused on who's up and who's down, he made a nation focus again on who matters -- the New Orleans child without a home, the West Virginia miner without a job, the families who live in that other America that is not seen or heard or talked about by our leaders in Washington,"" Obama said Wednesday. Clinton called Edwards a champion of the American people. ""John Edwards ended his campaign today in the same way he started it -- by standing with the people who are too often left behind and nearly always left out of our national debate,"" Clinton said in a statement. Commenting on his trip to New Orleans, Edwards said Tuesday the city symbolized why he chose to run for president. ""It's a living, breathing example of the heart of my message, what I'm talking about,"" Edwards said. ""I mean it's the failure of government to be there when people need it. It's a perfect indication of the conditions of poverty that exist in America."" Klein said Edwards played a positive role in spurring his competitors during the early part of the campaign. ""On a lot of substantive issues like health insurance, he was the first one out of the box with a very ambitious universal plan, and I think he forced the others to become bolder in a lot of their policy prescriptions, energy dependence and so on,"" Klein said. The remaining Democratic contenders face off in a debate at 8 p.m. ET Thursday on CNN. One Edwards aide said he is not dropping out of the race because of his wife's health. Elizabeth Edwards announced last year that her breast cancer had returned. She was first diagnosed with breast cancer during her husband's 2004 vice presidential campaign as John Kerry's running mate. John Edwards is a South Carolina native with an undergraduate degree from North Carolina State University and law degree from the University of North Carolina. Before entering politics, winning a Senate seat from North Carolina in 1998, Edwards was a lawyer representing families ""being victimized by powerful interests"" and gaining ""a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular, hard-working people,"" according to his campaign Web site.

"(CNN) -- If travel industry experts are correct, next year will see us snapping holiday ""braggies,"" eating dinner at a local's house, being served by a ""Botler"" and, more than likely, heading to Asia. Singapore, Thailand and Japan are among top destination picks for next year, while world-class sports events like the 2015 Rugby World Cup will also see fans flocking to host nation England. Why Asia's hot right now . ""One of the hottest regions is Asia and there are a couple of different drivers,"" says Elizabeth Crabill, president of global travel provider TravelBound, which serves 40,000 travel agents worldwide. Japan, notoriously expensive for foreign visitors, is set to become more affordable because of the depreciation of the yen, which has lost nearly a quarter of its value since 2012. ""International currencies are going to go a lot farther,"" says Crabill. She points to increased interest in Okinawa, ""the Hawaii of Japan,"" a string of islands in the south with a subtropical climate and a strong indigenous culture. Thailand is expected to bounce back from a coup in May, which hit tourism hard with unrest and curfews. ""There's a lot of pent up demand,"" says Crabill, adding that in spite of the recent negative headlines tourists are likely to stream back to Thailand for great food and glorious beaches. Meanwhile, Singapore will celebrate its 50th anniversary of independence in 2015, making it a big draw for visitors. Famed for its eclectic cuisine, soaring skyscrapers -- and, more recently, ambitions to transform itself into a city in a garden starting with the 100-hectare Gardens by the Bay -- Singapore is putting on a number of events to celebrate its Golden Jubilee. Highlights include the opening of the National Gallery Singapore and the opening of the Jubilee Walk, which will cover historic locations on the island. ""It's our top destination for 2015 globally,"" says Crabill. Instant messaging, wearable tech, robots . Tech continues to drive the future of travel and it's shaping everything from the way we show off about our holidays with ""braggies,"" like a selfie, but taken within 10 minutes of arriving at your hotel. It's also changing who brings us room service (clue: it might not be a human). ""Technology is the strongest disruptive force in the travel industry today,"" says Angelo Rossini, travel and tourism analyst at Euromonitor International. He's one of the editors of the annual WTM Global Trends Report 2014, released at last month's World Travel Market in London. One of the most surprising predictions in the report comes out of Asia, where millions of people now make travel bookings via instant messaging. Chinese messaging service WeChat has 440 million active users -- second only to U.S. messaging service Whatsapp -- but it's leading the way when it comes to monetizing its popularity. Chinese online travel agency Ctrip sells air, train and other tickets on WeChat, while travelers on low-cost carrier Spring Airlines book flights and check in using its WeChat service. ""Instant messaging is becoming a threat to telecoms companies -- and also for social media,"" says Rossini. ""We definitely expect this to become the case in more and more other regions of the world."" The report predicts that wearable tech (Internet-connected devices that you wear) will be an increasingly important tool for travelers over the next couple of years. Products currently on sale include the Sony SmartWatch and Google Glass. But it's the Apple Watch, which goes on sale in 2015, that's expected to be the real game changer. Starwood Hotels, which owns the Sheraton, St. Regis, W hotels and several other global brands, is getting ahead of the trend with an Apple Watch and iPhone app that allows hotel guests to unlock their hotel rooms without a key card. Perhaps taking all this to its logical extreme, Aloft Hotels, also part of the Starwood group, is trialing a robot butler, known as ""Botler"" in Cupertino, California. ""Botler brings you things you need, for example toothpaste, your slippers, a newspaper,"" says Caroline Bremner, head of travel and tourism for Euromonitor. Cruise line Royal Caribbean installed robot bartenders on its new Quantum of the Seas, which it says is the world's most technologically advanced cruise ship. However, technicians had to pull to plug on them on the inaugural voyage after they failed to stand glasses upright and mix cocktails fast enough, according to the Daily Telegraph. ""At some point the introduction of tech has to be functional, not just novelty, and there's a danger that hospitality goes toward gimmick,"" says Bremner. Do-it-yourself holidays and the sharing economy . In 2015, more of us will likely book our own holidays, use online forums to research destinations and rent from locals when we get there. ""We are seeing more and more people move away from the model of getting a package holiday,"" says James Kay, spokesperson for online booking and review company, TripAdvisor. The company announced in August 2014 that 315 million people now use the site each month -- an increase of 20% from 2013. Increasing numbers of people are using TripAdvisor's forums to research destinations in advance, taking the opportunity to ask locals specific questions. ""They will take time to put the pieces of a trip together, because they figure they can get better value for money on it and also find those local gems,"" Kay adds. The sharing economy, particularly peer-to-peer rentals and experiences, is gaining popularity at warp speed. Poster child of the movement, holiday rentals site Airbnb currently has 6 million guests in 190 countries. Some of that growth has come from word-of-mouth, according to Euromonitor's Bremner. ""People might have been hesitant but then they hear of (others) who have had a positive experience -- or not -- and they are more inclined to try it out,"" she says. Hanging with the locals . What we're all likely to be doing a lot more next year is eating with the locals -- not in restaurants but in their homes, according to the WTM Global Trends Report 2014. Sites like Eatwith.com, which pairs travelers with home cooks and Bookalokal.com, a network of locals who offer meals and cooking classes, are rapidly expanding. ""My best travel experiences have always involved having a local person on the ground, so I set out to launch a platform where travelers could connect with local people,"" says Bookalokal.com founder Evelyne White in the report. Both Bookalokal.com and EatWith.com apply the Airbnb model to dining: guests review hosts and some are verified for food quality, venue and cleanliness. Peer-to-peer sites that offer experiences, like Vayable.com, are also popping up. Vayable connects travelers with locals offering everything from a night photography tour of Paris to kayaking in Auckland to a tour of Kibera, Africa's largest slum. Services like these are forecast to become some of the fastest growing areas in the travel industry over the next few years, fueled by the public's appetite for authentic experiences and connections with local people.","Aloft Hotels is trying out a robot butler named ""Botler"" in Cupertino, California .

"U.S. officials held a ""positive"" meeting Monday with a North Korean delegation in an effort to restart talks with the reclusive nation over ending Pyongyang's nuclear program, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy said. The decision by the United States to launch the two days of discussions in Geneva, Switzerland, stems in part from recent meetings between North Korea and South Korea, a senior State Department official told reporters traveling with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Afghanistan last week. ""We are moving in a positive direction,"" U.S. Ambassador Stephen Bosworth said from the Kempinski Hotel in Geneva after the meeting concluded. ""We have narrowed some differences but we still have differences that we have to resolve."" The day started with both nations presenting their positions on the resumption of talks. Clifford Hart, U.S. special envoy to the six-party talks on North Korea, called the presentations ""useful."" The groups also dined together for dinner before adjourning for the night, said Bosworth, who is leading the U.S. delegation. The North Korean delegation is led by First Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan, Hart said. Discussions will continue Tuesday. ""As you know our goal is to find a solid foundation on which to launch a resumption of discussions both bilateral and multilateral and we will continue to work hard to bring that about,"" Bosworth said. At a previous meeting between the two countries in July, Washington laid out a list of things it was looking for from Pyongyang to demonstrate its seriousness about abandoning its nuclear ambitions, the State Department official told reporters last week. One of the things the United States was seeking is North Korean engagement with South Korea, the official said, adding that  a recent ""constructive meeting"" between the two countries helped get the parties to this point. The official said there is concern that if the United States or South Korea do not engage with North Korea, it could lead to miscalculation or provocations on the part of North Korea. The official said the meeting in Geneva would give the United States an opportunity to see how the North Koreans absorbed what the Americans laid out  in July, and what North Korea's intentions are. Deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner called the meetings ""exploratory"" in nature. ""We are not seeking to have talks for talks' sake,"" Toner said. It's ""safe to say we are looking for concrete actions"" by North Korea before resuming the six-party talks, which have been dormant since 2008, Toner said. The six-party talks are a vehicle launched under former President George W. Bush to negotiate an end to Pyongyang's nuclear program. They involve both Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia. At various points, progress seemed to be made, only to have North Korea either pull out over disagreements on verifiable declarations of their nuclear program or engage in what some U.S. officials described as belligerent behavior that scuttled the talks. The United States has been in contact on a regular basis with all sides involved in the six-party talks, Toner said. Washington has called repeatedly for Pyongyang to undertake a series of prerequisite steps, such as halting missile and nuclear tests, and further development of nuclear weapons, to show it is interested in coming back to talks. At a news conference this month with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, U.S. President Barack Obama said, ""If Pyongyang continues to ignore its international obligations, it will invite even more pressure and isolation. If the North abandons its quest for nuclear weapons and moves towards denuclearization, it will enjoy greater security and opportunity for its people."" After taking office in 2009, Obama was met with a set of provocations. North Korea test-fired missiles and conducted a new round of nuclear tests. A small opening toward the resumption of talks was reversed after North Korea was accused of sinking a South Korean naval vessel in the Yellow Sea, followed by their artillery shelling of a South Korean island in November 2010 in which two civilians were killed. Bosworth will step down from his position after the meetings and will be succeeded by Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, diplomatic sources said. The State Department did not give a specific reason for Bosworth's decision to step down, but Toner said he believes it is a ""personal"" decision. In addition to his role at the State Department, Bosworth has also maintained his position on the faculty at the Fletcher School of Diplomacy at Tufts University outside Boston. Hart, a foreign policy adviser to the U.S. Navy and an expert on China and Taiwan, will become the new chief U.S. negotiator to the six-party talks and will report to Davies in his new role.","""We are moving in a positive direction,"" U.S. special representative says .

"They were in classes or taking tests. Wearing their green blazers and white shirts, some of the students sat listening to a lecture. Then, the Taliban gunmen came, bursting through doors and firing in all directions. The horror that followed Tuesday at the Army Public School and Degree College in Peshawar, Pakistan, has shocked the world: 145 people dead, most of them children. Here are accounts by students, teachers and parents of what they witnessed during those hellish hours. Who are the Pakistani Taliban? THE STUDENTS . School tie as a tourniquet . Mohammed Bilal, 13, said he was taking a math test when the gunfire started. ""My thigh was burning like metal -- I fell,"" the seventh-grader told CNN at Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital where he was being treated for his injuries. But using his school tie as a tourniquet, Mohammed managed to run to the gate and escape the mayhem. 'A lot of children are under the benches -- kill them' Another student in the hospital, 14-year-old Ahmed Faraz, said he was in the school's auditorium when four or five people burst in through a back door and ""started firing rapidly."" The ninth-grader told CNN that after a bullet hit his left shoulder, he lay under one of the benches in the room. The militants were shouting, ""God is great,"" as they stalked through the auditorium, according to Ahmed. Then, he said, one of them observed that ""a lot of the children are under the benches,"" before uttering a chilling order: ""Kill them."" ""My shoulder was peeking out of the bench, and somebody was following,"" Ahmed recalled. ""They went into another room, (and when) I ran to the exit, I fell."" 'Bullets whizzed past my head' Muhammad Anas, 15, said that students in the auditorium were initially told that the sounds of bullets might be firecrackers. But then the door flew open and the attackers began firing. ""The bodies were falling in front of us,"" he said, and then one of the militants climbed on a desk and started shooting at individual students. ""Two bullets whizzed past my head while I lay on the floor,"" Anas told CNN. ""Then they went outside and started firing inside from the windows."" He said that was when he got shot in his right shoulder. He lay trapped amid the gunfire until soldiers arrived. 'I saw death so close' Shahrukh Khan, 16, was also in the auditorium. He gave Agence France-Presse a harrowing account of his brush with death. ""I saw a pair of big black boots coming towards me, this guy was probably hunting for students hiding beneath the benches,"" he told the French news agency. Khan said he felt burning pain in both his legs as he was shot just below the knees. He said he played dead, cramming his tie into his mouth so that he wouldn't scream. ""The man with big boots kept on looking for students and pumping bullets into their bodies,"" he told AFP. ""I lay as still as I could and closed my eyes, waiting to get shot again."" ""My body was shivering. I saw death so close and I will never forget the black boots approaching me -- I felt as though it was death that was approaching me."" After the men left, Khan said he tried to get up but fell to the ground because of his injuries. ""When I crawled to the next room, it was horrible. I saw the dead body of our office assistant on fire,"" he said. ""She was sitting on the chair with blood dripping from her body as she burned."" He said he took refuge behind a door and then passed out, waking to find himself on a hospital bed. THE TEACHERS . 'Some children got up and then they were shot' Zulfikar Ahmed, a math teacher, said he was in class when he heard the start of the shooting. ""I realized it was an attack,"" he told CNN. ""I told the children to get off their school benches and go under the benches. I hid under the benches with the children."" Ahmed, 45, said two of the militants came into the room and called out, ""Everyone get up, we will not harm you."" ""Some children got up and then they were shot, after which the attackers left the room,"" he said. ""The last man came back inside and started firing again."" Ahmed was shot in the thigh. Gunmen hit rooms 'one by one' Mudassar Abbass, a physics lab assistant at the school, described the gunmen's ruthless approach. ""The men entered into the rooms one by one and started indiscriminately firing at the staff member and students,"" he told AFP. The exams and the lecture in the auditorium meant students were grouped in different parts of the school, he said. THE PARENTS . 'A second life' Some parents who rushed to the school or the hospitals where the wounded were being treated had their worst fears allayed. Muhammad Arshad gave a sigh of relief after soldiers rescued his son Ehsan, The New York Times reported. ""I am thankful to God for giving him a second life,"" he said. 'In uniform in the morning .. in a casket now' But many others were confronted with devastating news. ""My son was in uniform in the morning. He is in a casket now,"" cried Tahir Ali as he came to the hospital to collect the body of his 14-year-old son, Abdullah. ""My son was my dream,"" Ali told The Associated Press. ""My dream has been killed."" 'Why did you snatch away my son?' Irshadah Bibi, 40, whose 12-year-old son was among the dead, beat her face in grief, AFP reported. ""O God, why did you snatch away my son?"" she sobbed. ""What is the sin of my child and all these children?"" She was throwing herself against an ambulance at the Lady Reading Hospital, AFP said, one of many inconsolable parents.","""The bodies were falling in front of us,"" a wounded student tells CNN .

"Washington (CNN) -- West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, the self-educated son of a coal miner who became the longest-serving member of Congress, died early Monday at age 92, the senator's office said. Byrd, a nine-term Democrat, was known as a master of the chamber's often-arcane rules and as the self-proclaimed ""champion of the Constitution,"" a jealous guardian of congressional power. His speeches were laced with references to poetry and the Greek and Roman classics, often punctuated by the brandishing of his pocket copy of the national charter. He was also known as the ""King of Pork,"" using top positions on the Senate Appropriations Committee to steer federal spending to his home state -- one of the nation's poorest. Byrd relished the title. ""Pork, to the critic, is service to the people who enjoy some of the good things in life, and I've been happy to bring to West Virginia the projects to which they refer. I have no apology for it,"" he said. ""When I am dead and am opened they will find West Virginia written on my heart."" He was an outspoken opponent of the war in Iraq, calling his 2002 vote against a ""blind and improvident"" authorization of military action the proudest moment of his career. West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin -- a Democrat -- has the power to appoint a replacement for Byrd, whose current term is set to expire in 2013. When Byrd entered Congress in January 1953, a postage stamp cost 3 cents and American kids were clamoring for a new toy called Mr. Potato Head. Harry Truman was president, Winston Churchill was Britain's prime minister, and Josef Stalin was still the Soviet Union's leader. In November 2009, two days before his 92nd birthday, Byrd passed Arizona Democrat Carl Hayden's record to become the longest-serving member of Congress. His health problems mounted in his later years, putting him in the hospital four times between February 2008 and September 2009. Under pressure from fellow Democrats, he announced he would step down as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee after the 2008 elections. ""I have been privileged to be a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee for 50 years and to have chaired the committee for 10 years, during a time of enormous change in our great country, both culturally and politically,"" he wrote in a statement announcing his intention. ""A new day has dawned in Washington, and that is a good thing. For my part, I believe that it is time for a new day at the top of the Senate Appropriations Committee."" Robert Carlyle Byrd was born Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. on November 20, 1917, in the North Carolina town of North Wilkesboro. His mother died when he was a year old, and he was adopted and renamed by his aunt and uncle, Titus and Vlurma Byrd. He started his political career by running for the state House of Delegates in 1946, while working as a butcher and welder. He won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives six years later, was elected to his first Senate term in 1958, and won his ninth in 2006, three weeks shy of his 89th birthday. ""If it's the Lord's will, the people will send me there. Why? This Constitution needs a champion,"" he said before the 2006 vote. As the senior senator of the majority party, Byrd served as the Senate's president pro tempore -- third in line of presidential succession, behind the vice president and speaker of the House. While he set two endurance records in Congress, he was only proud of one in the end. The other was for his 1964 filibuster against the Civil Rights Act, when he spoke for 14 hours and 13 minutes in an effort to derail the law. He opposed civil rights when he first ran for office, a stance he came to regret later in life. He blamed ""that Southern atmosphere in which I grew up, with all of its prejudices and its feelings,"" for his opposition to equal rights, which included joining the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s. He called the move ""the greatest mistake of my life,"" an ""albatross"" that would always shadow his career. ""It's a lesson to the young people of today, that once a major mistake has been made in one's life,"" he said, ""it will always be there, and it will be in my obituary."" Byrd was married to his childhood sweetheart, the former Erma James, for nearly 69 years before her death in 2006. They had two daughters. ""I have met queens and the wives of shahs and great women from all over the world, (but) to me now, this was the greatest woman I ever met in this world,"" he said. He did not complete a college degree until 1963, when he earned a law degree from American University in Washington after taking night classes -- the only time a member of Congress has earned a law degree while holding office. He also received a political science degree from West Virginia's Marshall University in 1994, at age 76. He rose through the Senate's Democratic ranks in the 1960s, and became the chamber's majority leader in 1977. He kept the party leadership when Republicans won back the Senate in 1980, serving as minority leader for six years, then spent two more years as majority leader after the 1986 elections. In 1989, he became chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee -- one of the most influential posts in Congress, with extensive control over the federal government's purse strings. Years later, Byrd explained to CNN the power of that unique position. ""In the forest there is a water hole,"" he said. ""All the animals have to come to that water hole sooner or later. The Appropriations Committee is a water hole."" He spent the rest of his career as the panel's chairman or ranking Democrat, steering an estimated $3 billion in federal projects to West Virginia since 1991, according to the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste. Byrd said he was looking out for the interests of his Appalachian constituents, nearly 20 percent of whom live below the federal poverty line. ""My memory is as good as it ever was, and it's stock full of recollections about the poor people of West Virginia, how they were laughed at,"" he told CNN in 2006. But in the same interview, Byrd said it was his October 2002 vote against the resolution that gave President George Bush the authority to launch the invasion of Iraq ""of which I am most proud."" He was one of 23 senators to oppose the authorization, warning that Congress was abdicating its constitutional power to declare war by giving the president what amounted to a blank check. ""We are rushing into war without fully discussing why, without thoroughly considering the consequences, or without making any attempt to explore what steps we might take to avert conflict,"" he said. Four months later, with an American-led army poised to move across the frontier and U.N. weapons inspectors reporting no sign of Iraq's suspected weapons programs, Byrd returned to the Senate floor to condemn a ""hauntingly silent"" chamber. Four years after casting that vote, he called the invasion ""the blunder of the age."" Though he promised to support U.S. troops ""to the last breath, the last dollar,"" he told CNN that he and other opponents of the war had been right. ""History will prove it was wrong to invade another country without provocation. That is wrong. That was wrong then, and it would be wrong 50 years from today,"" he said. CNN's Dana Bash, Mike Roselli and Candy Crowley contributed to this report.","NEW: Byrd: ""When I am dead ... they will find West Virginia written on my heart""

"From craggy cliffs to broad sandy beaches, Britain is rightly proud of its thousands of miles of shoreline. But campaigners say great stretches of it are now under threat from a tide of trash that's endangering wildlife and could impact visitors. The UK's Marine Conservation Society (MCS) has published the results of its annual ""big clean up,"" which sees hundreds of volunteers take to the country's beaches armed with garbage bags. The event, last September, saw more than 223,400 individual pieces of trash scooped from the shoreline -- the largest haul since the cleanups began 20 years ago. Among the more bizarre items recovered were a French bulletproof vest, an unopened packet of bacon, a brass candlestick and, disturbingly, a set of dentures. Ordinary people were seen as the biggest shoreline spoilers -- blamed for nearly 40% of the trash washing up or blowing onto beaches. Commercial and recreational fishing, shipping and sewage outlets are also blamed for detritus including nets, floats, used diapers and syringes. 'Disgusting tide' Lauren Eyles of MCS says the quantity of litter found was ""disheartening."" ""This is a disgusting tide of litter which is threatening the safety of beach visitors both human and animal. It's coming in from the sea, being blown from the land or simply being dumped and dropped,"" she said in a statement. MCS volunteers tackled more than 200 stretches of coast, which have been ranked from dirtiest to cleanest in terms of the number of sacks of trash filled. The worst offender was identified as Holes Bay, a roadside shore near the southern English town of Dorset, from which 60 sacks were filled. Chesil Cover Shore, also near Poole, came second on the list, with 50 sacks. However, several other beaches on the same area of coastline were considerably cleaner, including a stretch of Chesil Beach that generated just 60 sacks. A tourism official in Poole told CNN that, despite MCS trash haul, the coastline around the city has some of Britain's cleanest beaches. This includes Sandbanks, a wealthy enclave whose groomed sandy shore has been certified spotless by a European ""blue flag"" award for a record 26 successive years. Of those tackled by MCS volunteers, the cleanest was identified as Langland Bay, near the Welsh city of Swansea, which yielded just a quarter of a sack of trash. The top five cleanest also included: Vazon South, Guernsey; Seatown, Dorset; Goring, West Sussex; and Ferring, West Sussex.","UK's annual ""big clean up"" has yielded more than 223,000 pieces of beach trash .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday she did not come to Pakistan for ""happy talk."" Her three-day trip is aimed at getting frank, open discussions going about the fight against terrorism, and that includes presenting U.S. concerns about how much success Pakistan is having, she said. In an interview with CNN, Clinton said it's time to ""clear the air"" with a key U.S. ally. She added, ""I don't think the way you deal with negative feelings is to pretend they're not there."" ""I think it's important, if we are going to have the kind of cooperative partnership, that I think is in the best interest of both of our countries, for me to express some of the questions that are on the minds of the American people,"" Clinton told CNN's Jill Dougherty. The secretary's comments came a day after she seemed to question the commitment of some in the Pakistani government for going after the leaders of al Qaeda, who U.S. intelligence experts believe are taking refuge in Pakistan's remote tribal areas. ""Al Qaeda has had safe haven in Pakistan since 2002,"" she told a group of Pakistani journalists Thursday. ""I find it hard to believe that nobody in your government knows where they are and couldn't get them if they really wanted to."" She added, ""Maybe they're not gettable. I don't know."" In the CNN interview Friday, Clinton said she was not suggesting that someone inside the government might be complicit with al Qaeda or might be failing to follow through in fighting the terrorist group. ""No, no,"" she said. ""What I was responding to is what I have been really doing on this trip, which is there exists a trust deficit, certainly on the part of Pakistanis toward the United States, toward our intentions and our actions. And yet we have so much in common, we face a common threat. We certainly have a common enemy in extremism and terrorism, and so part of what I have been doing is answering every single charge, every question."" Trust ""is a two-way street,"" she added. While Pakistan's military operation has been ""extremely courageous in both Swat and now in South Waziristan, success there is not sufficient,"" she said. ""... I just want to keep putting on the table that we have some concerns as well. And I think ... that's the kind of relationship I'm looking to build here."" Asked whether she had underestimated the level of anti-American sentiment in Pakistan, Clinton said, ""No, because I've been following the research and the polling that's gone on for a couple of years. I knew that we were inheriting a pretty negative situation that we were going to have to address."" That's why she wanted three days in the country, ""a long trip for a secretary of state,"" she said. ""I wanted to demonstrate that, look, we are not coming here claiming that everything we've done is perfect. I've admitted to mistakes by our country going back in time, but I've also reminded people that we've been partners and allies from the beginning of Pakistan's inception as a country. Pakistan has helped us on several important occasions, and we are very grateful for that. So let's begin to clear the air here."" Clinton also commented on Iran, as the United States seeks clarification on whether the nation will agree to a deal brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency aimed at resolving a dispute about Iran's nuclear program. ""I am going to let the process play out, but clearly we are working to determine exactly what they are willing to do,"" Clinton said. The secretary made a vow to Israeli and Palestinian leaders during the CNN interview as well. ""We're going to do everything we can to try to clear away whatever concerns that the parties have, to actually get them into negotiations where they then can thrash out all of these difficult issues,"" she said. ""I think I'm pretty realistic about what has to be overcome for there to be the level of acceptance that is required to get into these negotiations,"" she added. ""But remember, prior to negotiations, people stake out all kinds of positions, and then in the caldron of actually getting down to specifics, that all begins to be worked out."" She referred to the experience of former President Bill Clinton. ""I watched in the '90s as my husband just kept pushing and pushing and pushing, and good things happened. There wasn't a final agreement, but fewer people died, there were more opportunities for economic development, for trade, for exchanges. It had positive effects, even though it didn't cross the finish line. So I think that being involved at the highest levels sends a message of our seriousness of purpose.""","Hillary Clinton says she aims to address questions that Americans are thinking about .

"(CNN)Pulsating beats, electrifying melodies and irresistible grooves -- East Africa's vibrant music scene has been steadily gaining exposure, and now entrepreneurs and investors are catching on. Two years after its launch, Mdundo, a Kenya-based online music distributor, has grown into a major provider of East African music with a 20,000 track strong library on its mobile web platform. Currently growing by over 200 songs each week, the company says some 6,000 artists have so far signed up to the service. Customers can download old and new tracks for free within a limit, or pay 300 Kenyan shillings (around $3) a month for unlimited access without adverts. Unsurprisingly, Mdundo accepts payment in the mobile currency M-Pesa or Safaricom airtime. Aside from providing a useful service for music-loving mobile users, Mdundo is also helping to raise the profile of East African artists. Lesser known singers, rappers and bands can reach a wider audience by signing up and uploading their tracks. They can also monitor downloads and get paid a share of the revenue from those downloads. ""There are no central rights holders of music in Africa and it's therefore extremely hard to manage rights and offer a complete library to the consumers,"" says CEO and co-founder Martin Nielsen. ""For that reason illegal sites normally have the biggest library because they don't clear any rights."" Rapid growth . Mdundo is funded by Google-backed 88mph, a seed fund and accelerator that focuses on investing in web and mobile startups that target the African markets. The business started as a conversation between founders Francis Amisi and Martin Nielsen, and investors 88mph. Four months later, the team had recruited 11 more members and created a beta version of Mdundo. After a month, in December 2012, the service officially launched in partnership with Airtel Kenya. In 2013, 1,000 East African artists signed up to the service and more than 1,000,000 Kenyan shillings (around $11,000) was paid to artists in royalties. The company places adverts in the music as another revenue stream, capitalizing on its reported reach of 20,000 active users per week. And now, with advertising clients including Microsoft, Samsung and Nokia, 6,000 artists signed up and 250,000 people having downloaded music, the startup has ambitious plans for the future. ""Within the past 12 months, Mdundo's library has been five-doubling and is now including music from more than 12 African countries,"" says Nielsen.

"(WIRED) -- Apple's got a lot planned for its Wednesday press event. While the invitation -- ""come see our latest creation""-- is broad and vague, it's fairly obvious that the biggest news will be the widely anticipated tablet. It's about time. Tech observers have been anticipating an Apple tablet for several years, churning out report after report of rumors and speculation. And Apple has been considering tablet designs since at least 1983. Now, perfectionist CEO Steve Jobs finally seems satisfied enough with the product to show it off in public. Are you excited about the Apple tablet? But that's not the only thing the company is likely to announce. Updates to the MacBook line and the iPhone OS are also likely to be on the ticket. Here's our guide to what you can realistically expect. And if you don't care to read our predictions, just stay tuned for the January 27 event. We'll be providing live blog and news coverage here on Gadget Lab and on Twitter: follow @bxchen and @GadgetLab for real-time news nuggets. The Apple tablet . Multiple independent reports have described the tablet's appearance as a 10- to 11-inch iPhone or iPod Touch. (AppleInsider's sources describe the tablet as ""a first-generation iPhone that's met its match with a rolling pin."") The tablet, many have reported, will serve as a slate-like substitute for magazines, newspapers and books, while also offering the general-purpose functions seen in the iPhone, such as gaming, viewing photos, Web surfing and using apps. A recent report from The Wall Street Journal said Apple will market the tablet to be shared among multiple people at home or in classrooms, thanks to its bigger screen. A few reports have claimed the tablet will sport a 10-inch OLED touchscreen, which would be great for reading books. But there aren't many of these displays on the market, and they would also cost Apple about $400 apiece. A 10-inch LCD touchscreen, on the other hand, would cost Apple $60, much more in line with the expected $1,000 price tag. The true mystery about the tablet lies in its software and user interface. Simply expanding the iPhone OS to fit a larger screen can't be the whole story. We expect a tablet interface that strives to appeal to everyone, like the iPhone OS does with its 3.5-inch screen, SpringBoard user interface and fingertip-sized icons. The ergonomics of text entry will especially be challenging on a device that size. People briefed on the product say it will incorporate a virtual keyboard. But if the tablet is going to serve as an alternative to a notebook or netbook, an ordinary virtual QWERTY isn't going to cut it. We're predicting Apple will incorporate new multitouch gestures, and maybe even the accelerometer, to trigger functions of the traditional QWERTY keyboard. Imagine if pressing two fingers down anywhere triggered the Shift key, for example. And to add a wild guess, we think Apple will expand on the voice-recognition feature seen in the iPhone 3GS, to augment text entry. Still, no one outside Apple's tablet team has a solid idea of what the tablet's interface will be like. The only minuscule clue is a quote from a recently departed Apple employee who told New York Times' Nick Bilton, ""You will be very surprised how you interact with the new tablet."" If it's taken Apple this long to figure it out, I'm sure we will be. But we do expect the tablet's operating system to share some of the same DNA as the iPhone OS. Indeed, the iPhone reportedly contains some elements of an older, shelved Apple tablet project. What could it be called? Internet sleuths at MacRumors.com have found evidence suggesting Apple is interested in the names iSlate, MagicSlate, iGuide and iPad. Apple has apparently filed for trademarks for each of those names. Apple not only filed for the iSlate trademark; the company also procured ownership of the domain iSlate.com, making this the most likely candidate. As for when the tablet will ship, WSJ published the most credible report to date claiming Apple has plans to ship the device in March. Price tag? All we've heard are guesses from analysts, some who claim the tablet will cost as much as $1,000 including carrier subsidy. We estimate the tablet should cost between $700 and $1,000, placing it somewhere in between an iPhone and a MacBook. There are a few scant rumors claiming the tablet will be carried by Verizon, but none seems substantive enough to bet money on. There's too little information out there about the carrier to make any reasonable predictions. In summary: . iPhone OS 4.0, iLife 2010 . Fox News' Clayton Morris had a scoop citing anonymous Apple employees who claim iPhone OS 4.0 and iLife 2010 will be announced at the event. I'm a believer. The tablet will likely have a beefed-up version of the iPhone OS with all the newest features. So given the logic that the tablet OS is ready to be announced, iPhone OS 4.0 should be ready for a preview as well. But a preview would probably be it, just so Apple can begin seeding betas to developers to prepare their iPhone apps for 4.0. As for iLife 2010, Apple has announced almost all of its iLife suites during January of years past. I believe we'll see an iLife launch only because it would be consistent. Jobs likes to pepper up press events with small announcements leading up to the major ""One more thing,"" so iLife and iPhone OS 4.0 will probably be the first to be announced. MacBook Pro upgrades -- maybe . An Intel contest promoted by e-mail appeared to leak upcoming MacBook Pros equipped with the newest Intel chips. Intel had sent e-mails to members of its Intel Retail Edge program, promoting a chance to win two MacBook Pros equipped with Intel's new Core i5 processors during January, according to a report by MacRumors. However, Intel soon after retracted the promotion, saying it was a mistake and that HP notebooks would be given away for the contest instead. I found this move suspicious, because the promotion had been sent in multiple languages to members in the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain. Seems odd that it would have gotten so far if the product weren't even real. Plus, MacBook Pros are due for a refresh. Apple last upgraded the MacBook Pro in June 2009, and typically the company refreshes notebooks every six or seven months. Therefore, my gut tells me Intel realized it accidentally leaked the MacBook Pros and then moved to undo the slip. I believe there's a good chance MacBook Pros will be announced at next week's event. iTunes Upgrade . I haven't seen any rumors of Apple introducing a new version of iTunes, but I assume it would have to, in order to launch the tablet. That's because the tablet alone won't be compelling unless it creates avenues for new content that can be used on the tablet, such as e-books, newspapers and magazines. Expect Apple to preview a new version of iTunes, perhaps 9.1, that would add new content sections to the iTunes Store. We'll most realistically see a new e-book section demonstrated in iTunes, as Apple has reportedly been in talks with HarperCollins Publishers to make e-books for the tablet.

"North Korea has agreed to halt nuclear tests, long-range missile launches and enrichment activities at its Yongbyon nuclear complex in exchange for food aid from the United States, the State Department said Wednesday. The state-run North Korean news agency, KCNA, announced the agreement separately. ""Today's announcement represents a modest first step in the right direction.  We, of course, will be watching closely and judging North Korea's new leaders by their actions,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday before the House Appropriations Committee. In return for the moratorium on nuclear activities at this key site, the United States has agreed to a package of 240,000 metric tons of nutritional assistance to North Korea. According to State Department officials who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified, the nutritional assistance will include corn-soy blend, beans, vegetable oils and ready-to-eat therapeutic food. There will be intensive monitoring to assure that the delivery is made to those in need and not diverted to the military or government elites, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement. ""The DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) has also agreed to the return of IAEA inspectors to verify and monitor the moratorium on uranium enrichment activities at Yongbyon and confirm the disablement of the 5-MW reactor and associated facilities,"" Nuland said. KCNA published comments from a spokesman for North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying the latest deal is part of an effort to improve relations between the two countries. ""The U.S. reaffirmed that it no longer has hostile intent toward the DPRK and that it is prepared to take steps to improve the bilateral relations in the spirit of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality,"" the spokesman said, according to the news agency. ""The U.S. also agreed to take steps to increase people-to-people exchanges, including in the areas of culture, education, and sports,"" the Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman said. The White House echoed Clinton's comments, with press secretary Jay Carney telling reporters that North Korea must demonstrate it is implementing the moratorium on nuclear activities at Yongbyon before further progress can occur. ""Commitments are one thing, following up is another,"" Carney said. Wednesday's announcement comes just after Glyn Davies, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy, returned from a meeting in Beijing with a North Korean delegation to discuss the North's nuclear program and the possibility of resuming U.S. food assistance to the country. It was the first meeting between U.S. and North Korean officials since the December death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and the transition in leadership to his son Kim Jong Un. Davies described the talks as ""substantive"" when they ended Friday but did not announce any breakthrough at that point. From Beijing, he traveled to South Korea and Japan to brief officials on the discussions.  He also met with Chinese officials before departing Beijing. The State Department officials who briefed reporters said the North Korean regime deserved credit for reaching out so soon after Kim Jong Il's death. ""It shows that the new ... administration in Pyongyang is picking up where the previous one left off.  And that's great; that's good,"" one State Department official said. ""And they're doing it within the 100-day mourning period that's self-declared in North Korea. So it shows that they're interested with some alacrity to reach out, to get back to the table, and begin to try to make diplomatic progress, and I think that's a positive sign."" In an interview with CNN in Morocco last weekend, Clinton said she saw glimmers of progress after the meetings between Davies and the North Korean delegation. ""We've always said that we are willing to talk,"" she said.  ""This is the first time that, under this new leader, we've had this opportunity, and we'll follow through."" The latest development follows years of stalemate and tension surrounding North Korea's nuclear program. Pyongyang agreed to curtail its nuclear activities in exchange for aid in an agreement reached in the so-called six-party talks in September 2005.  Under the plan, the North agreed to abandon its nuclear programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic incentives. The deal fell apart after North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and later disclosed a previously unknown uranium enrichment program that provided a second path to a bomb in addition to the already known plutonium program.","The White House says North Korea must now carry out the moratorium .

"In what may be his final act, retiring Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, insisted on changes to a bill reauthorizing a federal terrorism insurance program created after the September 11 terrorist attacks. ""If we change the bill, it's gone,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, arguing that any amendment to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, would require sending the bill back to the House of Representatives, which is on vacation until January 6. So, the bill will expire at the end of the year. The law was approved shortly after 9/11 to help insurance companies mitigate the costs of covering the aftermath of terrorist attacks. Coburn opposed a specific rider made to what would have been a six-year extension of the act. Called the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, it would create a federal bureaucracy built to license insurance agents. Coburn wanted an opt-out provision for states, and he disagreed with the length of the extension. ""It doesn't have anything to do with the terrorism risk insurance bill,"" said Coburn. Coburn said further that TRIA forces American taxpayers to ""take all the risk."" He said on the Senate floor Tuesday that the insurance industry has made $40 billion as a result of TRIA in the last 12 years. Rumors that an expiration of the law would lead the National Football League to cancel the Super Bowl were quashed Tuesday. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello told CNN in an email Tuesday that the speculation over the Super Bowl being canceled is ""not true."" ""The Super Bowl will be played,"" he said. Congressional Republicans have vowed to make a TRIA extension one of the first orders of business when the GOP-led Congress convenes in early January.","Sen.

"They're the most powerful couple in the country but President Barack Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama say they're sometimes still treated like the help. Speaking to People Magazine, the first lady recounts a trip to Target when a fellow customer asked for assistance with an item -- not recognizing her as the wife of the President of the United States. ""She didn't see me as the first lady, she saw me as someone who could help her,"" Mrs. Obama said. ""Those kinds of things happen in life. So it isn't anything new."" The president said he -- like many African-American men -- had been mistaken for a valet. ""There's no black male my age, who's a professional, who hasn't come out of a restaurant and is waiting for their car and somebody didn't hand them their car keys,"" he told the magazine. Obama said those indignities don't compare to the violent struggle for equal rights waged a generation ago. But he said it's concerning when law enforcement regards African-American men with undue suspicion. ""It's one thing for me to be mistaken for a waiter at a gala. It's another thing for my son to be mistaken for a robber and to be handcuffed, or worse, if he happens to be walking down the street and is dressed the way teenagers dress,"" he said. The Obamas comments come after a spate of incidents that involve police and race -- in two cases, grand juries failed to indict police officers responsible for the deaths of unarmed black men, leading to angry protests. Some have called on Obama to take a firmer stand against aggressive police tactics. The White House announced earlier this month a review panel to look into the relationship between communities and police forces nationwide.","Obamas spoke to People Magazine .

"These are troubled times for President Barack Obama. He's a lame duck president. The latest CNN/ORC poll has his approval rating at 41% -- the lowest of his presidency. And the Affordable Care Act, his signature legislation, has been hobbled by the botched and much maligned rollout of the signup website. So, the historic deal that Iran reached with six world powers over Tehran's nuclear program couldn't come at a better time. 20 questions about the Iran nuclear deal . ""Today, diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure,"" Obama said in a televised address from the East Room of the White House, after the deal was announced. ""A future in which we can verify that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon."" But will the agreement be enough to help distract the public from the Obamacare rollout debacle and potentially improve his image? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Read the deal (.PDF) In a CNN/ORC poll released Thursday, 56% of Americans said they'd favor the kind of interim deal with Iran that was eventually reached. Another 39% said they'd oppose it. The agreement -- described as an ""initial, six-month"" deal -- includes ""substantial limitations that will help prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon,"" according to the president. ""Simply put, they cut off Iran's most likely paths to a bomb,"" he said. But there are drawbacks as well. Kerry: Israel is safe under new deal . The deal complicates Obama's relationship with Israel, a key ally in the region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly oppose any deal, and the Israeli government had strong words Sunday. ""The current deal ... is more likely to bring Iran closer to having a bomb,"" Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, a close Netanyahu associate said. ""Israel cannot participate in the international celebration, which is based on Iranian deception and the world self-delusion."" A senior administration official told reporters, ""You can be sure that President Obama will speak to Prime Minister Netanyahu"" on Sunday. The President also faces skepticism from Congress, where there were talks of increased sanctions as recently as this week. Netanyahu: Iran nuclear deal 'historic mistake' The deal says that the U.S. will provide $6 to $7 billion in sanction relief in exchange. And Obama can do so by executive order -- bypassing Congress altogether. Reactions poured in late Saturday night, with Republicans slamming the administration for appeasing the Iranian regime. ""This deal appears to provide the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism with billions of dollars in exchange for cosmetic concessions that neither fully freeze nor significantly roll back its nuclear infrastructure,"" said Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois. Fareed Zakaria: What critics are getting wrong about the Iran deal . U.S.-Iranian relations have been thawing for months now, since the election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran's seventh president in June. A senior administration official confirmed Saturday that since the election, U.S. and Iranian officials have been holding private, previously secret discussions to generate ideas for the wider nuclear negotiations. The détente climaxed in a telephone conversation between Obama and Rouhani this fall during the United Nations General Assembly -- the highest contact between leaders of the two countries since the Islamic revolution that led to the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979. ""While today's announcement is just a first step, it achieves a great deal,"" Obama said. ""For the first time in nearly a decade, we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program and key parts of the program will be rolled back,"" Ultimately, however, the outcome  -- and part of Obama's legacy -- hinges on what happens next: Negotiations will continue over the next six months to reach a comprehensive solution to the Iran's nuclear program. ""The success of interim deals will be measured in months and years, not in minutes,"" said Karim Sadjadpour, a leading researcher on Iran for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. All eyes, of course, will be on the president through then. One agreement, wildly different reactions .","Will the agreement be enough to help distract the public from the Obamacare rollout debacle?

"A short story, buried on the fourth page of the sports supplement: that's how the New York Times, one of America's most globally orientated of newspapers, marked what remains as U.S. Soccer's most sensational result to date and possibly one of the greatest underdog victories of any World Cup. In front of 10,000 fans in Belo Horizonte, a U.S team fielding three part-time players lined up for their second match of the 1950 World Cup hosted by Brazil. It was a fixture that promised only humiliation for the 500-1 outsiders, as their opponents were the supremely confident, superstar-studded and much-lauded originators of the game: England. Interest in the match was limited back home. In fact, just one reporter from the world's richest nation had made the trip, and only because he'd paid his own way and used precious vacation time to attend. His newspaper, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, had seen no value in covering the event. But Dent McSkimming proved to be on the right side of history. For he was the only American journalist to file the epic tale of how a lone goal from Joe Gaetjens defeated the English Goliath and astonished the rest of the soccer-playing world. It was as if ""Oxford University sent a baseball team ... and beat the Yankees,"" he famously wrote. In 2014, if the U.S. beat Belgium on Tuesday to once again upset the odds on Brazilian soil, it's fair to say Uncle Sam's hacks will face stiffer competition for their words to be immortalized in the same vein. It seems soccer is starting to stir the soul of the American sports fan and, consequently, there are now hundreds relaying stories where there was once one. Key indicators suggest interest in the sport Stateside has reached a new zenith. The 2-2 draw Jurgen Klinnsman's men wrangled from Portugal became the most-watched soccer game in American history according to Nielsen figures when it attracted 25 million television viewers. Bearing in mind that baseball's 2013 World Series averaged 15 million viewers on Fox while the NBA Finals delivered a similar figure for ABC, college and NFL football now remain the only sports franchise with a greater magnetism for Americans. For the tournament's games in general there's been a 50% audience increase in the U.S. from those of the World Cup in South Africa, 4.3 million against 2.8 million in 2010. This heightened profile means business has been brisk too. Accountancy firm PWC recently predicted global sports revenues will be worth $145.3 billion by 2015, driven on by events like the World Cup. America accounts for 45% of this market and the 20 sponsors of U.S. Soccer -- from Anheuser-Busch and AT&T to Visa and Yingli Solar -- have hit the jackpot in Brazil. ""As much as our own expectations were extremely high, those (audience) numbers surpassed even what we anticipated,"" David Wright, senior vice-president of global sponsorship for Soccer United Marketing, MLS's commercial arm that represents U.S. Soccer, told Sport Business Journal. And it's a sentiment shared by one of America's sport apparel giants too. Nike entered into football in 1994 and has seen its revenues in this area go from $40 million then to $2.3 billion for the last financial year. ""We don't give out numbers but sales for the two U.S. soccer kits that we make have been very strong,"" Charlie Brooks, Nike's VP of Global Communications told CNN. ""The red, white and blue away kit was the best-selling U.S. kit we've ever done in North America in the first two weeks after its launch. And even before the tournament had started, the level of interest was huge ... we posted a 21% increase in our football product revenues for the year leading up to the World Cup, and our North America region was up 10% in the fourth quarter helped by strong sales in soccer too. ""The average sports fan in the U.S. is getting into football during this World Cup like never before. Watching ESPN's coverage in the States, with every game live and the action appearing in Sports Center, the fan fests in the major cities ... it shows this is no longer a minority sport but one that is on the up,"" Brooks added. ""Our animated 'Last Game' advert has hit 200 million views online alone. The three films in our 'Risk Everything' campaign combined registered over 380 million online views ... I don't have exact figures but these are two of the most shared brand videos in Facebook's history. 'The Winner Stays' commercial had 75 million views online before it went on TV."" The digital realm is another area that is experiencing a surge of traffic from America's World Cup interest.  The last group game against Germany set a fresh online audience record when over 1.5 million people streamed the game via WatchESPN. This World Cup has also seen a new high of 389,000 messages-per-minute recorded on Twitter, eclipsing the previous mark set by activity around Superbowl XLVIII. Facebook confirmed this year's festival of football is the first event to generate 1 billion engagements -- posts, comments and likes -- on its platform with 220 million users (20 million more than the entire population of Brazil) interacting. During the U.S. vs. Portugal game alone, 10 million people generated 20 million Facebook interactions. And it's not just fandom in the digital sphere where America has been a force. Supporters from the States were second only to host nation Brazil in the amount of tickets (196,838) they bought for the tournament, with fan-group leaders confident this trend is only set to continue. ""This hasn't been an overnight sensation; it's been building and growing for 25 years.  We're excited to see our fan base grow and more and more people involved in the World Cup,"" Neil Buethe, U.S. Soccer's senior manager of communication, told CNN. ""Our number one goal is player development; number two is growing the game and connecting with our fans. So we set up events (at the World Cup) with our supporters where they can meet the players or on social (platforms) we provide a lot of information from behind the scenes, so they can feel part of the team at all times."" U.S. Soccer work closely with unofficial supporters' groups too, such as the ""American Outlaws"" -- who organize travel packages for World Cup ticket holders and parties on the ground. ""In 2010 we had 25 official chapters (groups across America) and 10,000 members. Currently we're up to 143 chapters and 25,000 members ... and 7,000 members joined in the last two weeks,"" Outlaw Daniel Wiersema told CNN. ""Only around 50 people came to South Africa with us, it was basically one coach-load. This year we arranged travel packages and accommodation for 530 members ... despite the large distances that need to be covered in Brazil, so it's changing."" Fandom is evolving in a uniquely American way too. ""The great thing about being an American soccer fan is we can borrow some of the best aspects of other U.S. sports ... so we tailgate before games for example, as well as take on the influence of Europe and Latin America,"" Wiersema said. ""Either way there is no better way to demonstrate your fandom than following your team to the ends of the earth, it's just an amazing experience."" That's if you can avoid the inevitable hangovers that accompany such an adventure, though Wiersema attests that the last-minute draw with Portugal gave him a bigger headache than any '""caipirinhas sunk in Brazil."" The plucky American Outlaws that remain in Brazil have trekked to Salvador ahead of the showdown with Belgium holding onto the belief that this nation can once again provide inspiration for their side to make history and reach the quarterfinals. McSkimming would no doubt be proud of the progress. Off the field: The men of the USMNT .

"The end of the 50-year freeze in diplomatic relations with Cuba will mean many more U.S. travelers could be on their way to the neighbor island, only 90 miles from Key West, Florida. But the days of Havana as a glamorous destination for U.S. tourists — as it was before the Cuban revolution ended legal U.S. travel there — aren't returning quite yet. And while American visitors who do make it to Cuba will be able to return with rum and cigars, exporting them for sale in the United States still isn't in the works. Historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba standoff . Americans already travel to Cuba in large numbers — nearly 100,000 per year, according to Cuban government statistics. The numbers rose after Obama's 2009 easing on some of the restrictions on travel to Cuba, including making it easier for Americans to visit family members there, and a subsequent 2011 announcement allowing for certain types of other trips. Now Obama is easing up restrictions for other kinds of visitors. Administration officials listed a host traveler types the federal government will now allow to visit: government officials, journalists, professional researchers, educators, religious officials, performers planning public presentations, humanitarians, emissaries of private foundations, and importers or exporters. Officials say all legitimate applications received by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control — the body that dispenses licenses to for Cuban travel — will be approved. When they visit, Americans will be able to use their credit or debit cards on the island, a convenience previously banned. Agencies inside the United States will be permitted to organize trips. And American telecom equipment will now be allowed into Cuba, making communication with Americans easier. But the day when Americans can log online to book a vacation in Cuba hasn't yet arrived. U.S. officials say the ban on tourism in Cuba is still in place; the overall ban on travel to Cuba can't disappear without congressional changes to the law. ""The ban has to be lifted by Congress,"" a senior administration official said. ""But the President is doing everything that he can with his authority to facilitate travel within the limitations of the law, and we believe that that will lead to a significant increase in travel."" Americans have long found ways around the travel ban to Cuba. U.S. citizens have been known to get around travel restrictions by stopping first in a country with flights to the island.

"(CNN) -- Former Czech President Vaclav Havel showed up at the Chinese Embassy in Prague Wednesday to protest the imprisonment of a Chinese dissident, the official Czech News Agency reported. Havel, himself a former dissident jailed by his country's Communist regime in the 1970s and 1980s, was criticizing the 11-year prison sentence imposed on Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. Havel and two fellow former dissidents wanted to hand a letter personally to a Chinese official in the Czech Republic, but no one opened the door at the embassy, forcing Havel to put the letter in the embassy's mailbox, the agency reported. Liu is a co-author of Charter 08, which calls for greater political freedom in China. It is modeled on Charter 77, an anti-Communist manifesto launched by Havel and others 33 years ago Wednesday. Havel chose the anniversary date specially to make the protest, he said. Liu has been one of China's most prominent dissidents since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest -- which came, coincidentally, only months before Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution toppled Communism there and ushered Havel into the presidency. Czechoslovakia split into two independent countries -- the Czech Republic and Slovakia -- in 1993. Liu was sentenced last month to 11 years in prison for his role in a separate subversion case, his lawyer said December 25. Attorney Shang Baojun said that Liu's political rights would be suspended for two years under the sentence. Shang said he was disappointed with the verdict and felt the sentence was harsher than he had expected. Liu, a former university lecturer and literary critic, faced a possible 15-year jail sentence, amid growing international outrage over his year-long detention, according to media reports. He was detained on December 8, 2008, and held under ""residential surveillance"" as police investigated the case, according to the PEN American Center, a U.S. literary and human rights organization. On June 23, 2009, he was arrested and charged with inciting subversion of state power, the organization said. Liu is on the PEN board of directors. The case was turned over to the prosecutor's office on December 8, 2009 -- one year from the time Liu was detained. Charter 08 is ""a declaration calling for political reform, greater human rights, and an end to one-party rule in China that has been signed by hundreds of individuals from all walks of life throughout the country,"" PEN says on its Web site. The group said Liu was arrested before the formal release of Charter 08. ""Liu has been engaged in agitation activities, such as spreading of rumors and defaming of the government, aimed at subversion of the state and overthrowing the socialism system in recent years,"" according to a police statement reported by China's state-run Xinhua news agency. The statement claimed Liu confessed to the charge during a preliminary police investigation. Liu served as an adviser to student leaders during the demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Along with three other intellectuals, he took part in hunger strikes there on June 2 of that year prior to the crackdown to show support for the flagging student protests. He was arrested two days after the Tiananmen crackdown and was released in 1991. In May 1995 he was detained again for collecting signatures for a petition calling for human rights guarantees. The U.S. government called for Liu's release. ""The United States was deeply concerned to learn that ... Liu ... was found guilty of 'incitement to subvert state power,'"" said Mark Toner, an acting State Department spokesman. ""We call on the Government of China to release him immediately and to respect the rights of all Chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views."" CNN's John Vause contributed to this report.","Former Czech President Vaclav Havel protests imprisonment of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo .

"As his case meanders through the Bolivian justice system, an American businessman imprisoned there for a year without formal charges is finding support from a leading human rights advocate in the U.S. Congress. Jacob Ostreicher, a 53-year-old flooring contractor from Brooklyn, New York, has been held at the notorious Palmasola prison in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, since June 2011 on suspicions of money laundering. Ostreicher and his family have claimed from the beginning that he is innocent, and presented a judge what they say is evidence that all of the money invested in a rice growing operation came from legal sources. But repeated delays have kept him imprisoned. The case is now getting more attention in Washington, as U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, has become a vocal advocate for him. Smith traveled to Bolivia this week to meet with Ostreicher in prison and to accompany him to a hearing Monday. At that hearing, the judge transferred the case to a higher court, a move likely to create further delays. ""Justice delayed is justice denied,"" Smith said in a statement. ""Jacob has been cooperative, patient to the extreme. There is no evidence offered against him. The rule of law must prevail in Bolivia. Innocent people must have a path to justice. He must be released."" Ostreicher is nearly two months into a hunger strike to protest his imprisonment. Smith reported that Ostreicher appeared ""frail and anguished."" The lawmaker's trip follows a hearing last week before the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights, which Smith chairs. Ostreicher's wife and daughter testified before the panel and retold what they knew about the case. In short, Ostreicher traveled to Bolivia to check on a woman who had been hired to run a rice operation that he and others had invested in. That woman allegedly had ties with a drug trafficker, and the land being used for the rice was tied to the trafficker's brother. Bolivian prosecutors have accused Ostreicher of money laundering, though formal charges are yet to be filed. Ostreicher says he was unjustly ensnared in the investigation. Among those who testified last week was Steve Moore, a former FBI agent who is known for his work on the Amanda Knox case in Italy. He has conducted an independent review of Osteicher's case. ""I have seen all the Bolivian's self-described 'evidence' against him, and I have seen the evidence which supports his innocence,"" Moore said in his written testimony on June 6. ""In Jacob's case there is a complete absence of any concrete, tangible evidence on even a microscopic scale which would indicate that he had in any way shape or form participated in a crime in Bolivia."" He criticized the U.S. State Department for placing too much trust in the Bolivian justice system and not advocating more strongly for the jailed American. ""Bolivia's system is neither just nor is it legitimate,"" he said. ""What has happened to Jacob Ostreicher is little more than a state-sponsored kidnapping for ransom."" Smith this month wrote a letter to Roberta Jacobson, assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, asking her to publicly advocate on Ostreicher's behalf during the General Assembly of the Organization of American States which took place in Bolivia last week. Jacobson did not mention the case in front of the OAS, Smith said. Prosecutors told CNN in September that they are suspicious of Ostreicher because of the lengths he went to to try to recoup the investors' losses and his continued negotiations with the landowner. Meanwhile, Ostreicher's case is getting more local and international media attention. Prison authorities have initiated a separate investigation into media interviews Ostreicher has done. One report, which included file footage of prostitution and drug use inside the Palmasola prison has stirred unrest, and prison authorities have recommended a 15-day punishment for his participation in the media stories. His wife says that the punishment, if handed out, could mean that her husband would be transferred to the even tougher and more dangerous Chonchocoro prison. Smith promised to continue to push the case. ""What was a relatively obscure case is now a growing international embarrassment for the (Evo) Morales government that runs Bolivia,"" he said.","Rep.

"Pope Benedict XVI is not suffering from any specific disease that forced him to resign, his spokesman said Tuesday, a day after the news that he was stepping down shocked the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. The pontiff is resigning because he does not feel he has the strength to continue as the church's leader, the Rev. Federico Lombardi said, adding that it was a ""spiritual"" decision. Lombardi emphasized that Benedict remains pope until February 28, when his resignation takes effect. He dismissed reports in an Italian newspaper that the pope's decision was linked to a medical intervention to replace the battery in his pacemaker, saying that had been a routine procedure. Benedict has had the pacemaker since he was a cardinal, he added. Benedict's service will end at 8 p.m. on February 28 and he will continue his work as planned until then, Lombardi said, including an important meeting with the cardinals and priests this Thursday. He will hold a final audience in Vatican City's St. Peter's Square on February 27, Lombardi said. Despite addressing reporters at length, Lombardi left many questions about what will come next unanswered -- including those concerning exactly when a successor will be elected. The Vatican does not yet know when cardinals will meet in a conclave to decide who will replace Benedict, Lombardi said. Vatican experts are studying legal documents on the subject, he explained. But the conclave is likely to come between 15 and 20 days after the pontiff steps down, he said, and a new pope will be in place before Easter is celebrated at the end of March. Much of the uncertainty stems from the fact this is the first time a pope has stepped down in nearly 600 years. The pope said Monday he is resigning ""because of advanced age."" ""Strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me,"" said Benedict, 85, according to the Vatican. The pope, born Joseph Ratzinger, will first head to the pope's summer residence in Castel Gandolfo before he likely retires to a monastery and devotes himself to a life of reflection and prayer, Lombardi said. He won't be involved in managing the church after his resignation. Read the full text of Pope Benedict XVI's declaration . The pope's older brother, the Rev. Georg Ratzinger, told CNN in Regensburg, Germany, that Benedict had come to his decision without seeking his brother's advice. Asked if Benedict sounded relieved when the pair spoke Monday, his brother said: ""His voice sounded the same as by every other call. He planned the whole event and it worked out well. The news is now out in the world, and now his life must continue its normal path."" Ratzinger, himself 89, did not specify when his brother began to feel too frail to carry on. But, he said, ""The aging process causes difficulties, only in the last few years, first as he was 80 and then when you go past 85 ... when you cross these hurdles you feel like everything becomes more difficult."" He is not sorry to see his brother step down, he said. ""I'm realistic. I can see that the advancement of life brings changes and it goes along these lines. I would say that I would have been happy, had he been able to continue, but I take this realistically and soberly -- that it's for the best."" Benedict's decision has inevitably prompted frenzied speculation over who might assume the papacy in his place. While Benedict won't be directly involved in his successor's selection, his influence will undoubtedly be felt. He appointed 67 of the 117 cardinals that -- as of Monday -- are set to make the decision. The number of electors could drop to 115, as two cardinals will turn 80 in March, when their age makes them ineligible to cast a vote. More than two-thirds of the final number of cardinals must agree on the next pope. The announcement that a decision has been made will come in the form of a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the Vatican. From police officer's son to pope: The life of Joseph Ratzinger . The Vatican does not formally invite cardinals to come to Rome for a conclave to elect a new pope, Lombardi said Tuesday. ""The cardinals are intelligent people. They know to come,"" he said, adding that he expected them to arrive during the first two weeks of March. Much speculation has focused on whether Benedict's successor might come from Africa or Latin America, rather than Europe, where Roman Catholic congregations are shrinking. Ratzinger said he expected to see a pope chosen from outside Europe one day -- but not just yet. ""I'm certain a pope will come from the new continents but whether it will be now, I have my doubts,"" he said. ""In Europe, we have many very able people, and the Africans are still not so well known and maybe do not have the experience yet."" Bets are already being placed on which of the cardinals might step into Benedict's shoes. Perhaps belying Ratzinger's prediction, UK bookmaker William Hill has Canadian Marc Ouellet and Ghanaian Peter Turkson are showing as favorites so far, at 7-2 odds. Close behind are the Archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Angelo Scola, at 5-1 and Argentina's Leonardo Sandri, at 7-1. There are odds of 33-1 on New York's Timothy Dolan becoming pope. Whoever gets the nod, the selection of a new pontiff is expected to go smoothly. ""We're not going to have a problem of two competing popes. If Pope Benedict still wanted to have influence, he wouldn't have stepped down,"" said senior Vatican communications adviser Greg Burke. ""What's interesting is how long ago this decision was made -- shortly after the pope's trip to Cuba, which was in March of last year, so that was before the whole butler story even broke."" The pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele, was convicted in a Vatican court last year on charges of leaking private papers from the Vatican. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison but was pardoned weeks later. The leaked papers revealed claims of corruption in the church's hierarchy. As an aside, Lombardi referred to concerns over financial oversight in the city state, which have meant that Vatican shops and museums have not been able to accept credit or debit cards since January 1. ""The credit card payments in the state of the Vatican city are again working, and so the pilgrims as well as the tourists who visit the church of St. Peter's every day can now use the ordinary payment service, including paying for the Vatican museums,"" Lombardi said. The payment service is guaranteed by Swiss firm Aduno, he said. ""Thus, even though the pope has resigned, things get done,"" he added. Filipino iReporter Rummel Pinera says Benedict's decision to resign should prompt wider debate about how long pontiffs should serve. ""I believe that a pope should have a term limit or be given the privilege to resign from office, if he can't do his various duties effectively anymore due to health reasons or old age,"" he said. Meanwhile, Italian iReporter Martina Lunardelli says she was shocked by the pope's decision to resign but feels it was the right one to make. She warns against judging the pontiff for what she says was obviously a difficult choice, and urges those who are speculating about his resignation to respect matters which are ""above"" them in knowledge and understanding. While not quite unprecedented, Benedict's resignation is certainly historic. The last pope to step down before his death was Gregory XII, who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope.","Pope's brother says he does not expect new pope to come from outside Europe .

"We sometimes liken the presidential campaign to an extended job interview, but it's certainly unlike any job any of us has ever applied for. You've probably never gone into an interview where your prospective employer said, ""Your résumé looks good, but of course we'll have to decide if we like your spouse, go through your tax returns, talk to your elementary school classmates, see how you react when crazy people ask you bizarre questions, and make sure the car you drive communicates the proper patriotism and ordinary-guy credibility."" It isn't enough to know whether a candidate can do the job well or whether his agenda accords with ours; we need to gaze into the very depths of his soul. This question becomes particularly acute for candidates who seem awkward or unskilled at the glad-handing part of politics, the requirement to forge deep emotional connections with voters in the span of a few seconds. Mitt Romney is only the latest to struggle with ""authenticity"" (as John Kerry and Al Gore did), and six months from election day voters and reporters are still trying to determine just what kind of person he is. So it no doubt caused panic in the Romney camp when the Washington Post published an account of Romney's high school years at the elite Cranbrook school in suburban Detroit, detailing the young man's penchant for practical jokes and what he now calls ""hijinks."" The worst was an incident involving a socially awkward boy, suspected of being gay, who had dyed his hair blond. ""He can't look like that. That's wrong. Just look at him!"" Romney told a friend, according to the Post. He then led a group that tracked the boy down, tackled him, and held him on the ground. As the boy cried and yelled for help, Romney reportedly clipped his hair with scissors. When he was questioned about the story, Romney gave what has now become the politicians' standard response to the revelation of misbehavior from long ago: ""I don't recall the incident myself, but I've seen the reports and I'm not going to argue with that. There's no question but that I did some stupid things when I was in high school and obviously if I hurt anyone by virtue of that, I would be very sorry for it and apologize for it."" You'd hardly expect any politician in his position to say anything different. Perhaps Romney is being completely sincere. But the Post confirmed the story with five witnesses, four of whom described it on the record, so there seems little doubt about whether it occurred. They were deeply troubled by their participation in it, and recall it vividly to this day. News: Romney's ex-classmate: 'It was assault.' A candidate who has struggled with seeming human, as Mitt Romney has, could have done himself a favor by using this as an opportunity to show a little more of himself. He could have said: Yes, it happened. It was stupid and cruel. I wish I could go back and undo it. But part of growing up is realizing where you failed when you were young, and learning from your mistakes so you can become a better person. Most importantly, Romney could have said something that indicated he had a conception of how horrible the assault must have been for John Lauber, the victim. His only mention of Lauber, who died in 2004, was to say ""I had no idea what that individual's sexual orientation might be."" By referring to Lauber as ""that individual"" he makes Lauber a nameless figure, further distancing himself from the incident. Which is exactly the opposite of what he should have done. After all, it's the quality of empathy -- being able to see things from someone else's perspective and feel what they feel -- that Romney has had trouble convincing voters he possesses. This problem comes up for Romney again and again, often in the form of ""gaffes"" that are usually taken out of context, but still reveal a tin ear for the lives people lead. To take just one example, when Romney said ""I like being able to fire people that provide services to me,"" anyone who has ever been laid off recoiled in shock, whatever the context. Business owners and supervisors who have had to do the firing -- the humane ones, anyway -- know it can be a painful experience from the other side of the desk as well. It may be necessary at times, but you certainly wouldn't say you ""like"" it. Perhaps Romney really doesn't remember the assault on John Lauber nearly a half-century ago, despite the fact that so many of the other people who were there have never forgotten it. Or perhaps he decided that claiming ignorance would be the safest course of crisis management. But what he said told people nothing about the man he is today and how he has changed and grown over that time. We're all different people than we were in our youth, and we all have regrets. The 17-year-old Mitt Romney may have been a privileged, entitled boy with a mean streak. The 65-year-old Mitt Romney missed an opportunity to convince us he's something different.","Paul Waldman: Running for president means people will delve deep into your past .

"Egyptian voters this month ratified a new constitution that enshrines the military, police and intelligence in positions of unprecedented power. Filmgoers elsewhere could watch ""The Square,"" Jehane Noujaim's documentary about resilient revolutionaries -- youth, intellectuals and Muslim Brotherhood -- fighting  for dignity, social justice, economic empowerment and freedom. Which is the true Egypt? Both, but the second has been ignored by the Obama administration and much of the media. In Washington as in Egypt, there are two narratives: 1) The army has brought back stability, and the revolution is over; 2) Egyptians have banished fear, if not the regime, and many who led and joined the revolution continue to fight for the same aspirations, while soberly acknowledging the challenges ahead. The second narrative comes to life in ""The Square,"" the Oscar-nominated documentary that tracks Egypt's uprisings from the inspiring 18 days that began three years ago on January 25, when protesters crossed Tahrir Square, to the crackdown on the Brotherhood camps last August. (Full disclosure: I donated $90 to the Kickstarter campaign that supported the film, and I know director Jehane Noujaim and producer Karim Amer personally.) Through the eyes of three revolutionaries who meet in Tahrir Square during the first protests in 2011-- Ahmed Hassan, a young street vendor who emerges as a charismatic leader in Tahrir; Khalid Abdalla, a third-generation activist and actor (star of ""The Kite Runner,"" and founder of the post-revolution media collective Mosireen); and Magdy Ashour, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood -- we see the events of the last three years unfold in fits and starts of optimism, betrayal, and disappointment. This is the Egypt that the Obama administration has forgotten. This is the Egypt that took Washington by surprise three years ago. True, the initial promise of those utopian 18 days when the country overcame economic and ethnic barriers to find common cause, has not been redeemed. No surprise. After decades of U.S.- backed authoritarian rule, Egyptians have no reliable independent institutions, only the ability to take to the streets in protest. And now the new military-backed constitution takes that away. Ahmed, Khalid, Magdy, and their compatriots in ""The Square"" -- such as Ramy, who is brutally beaten by the security forces for the crime of leading Tahrir in song -- demonstrate that this Egypt is resilient. They may not have learned to organize political parties and to take power in three years, a failing that left first the Brotherhood and then the military to fill that vacuum, but they also are not abandoning the struggle for their rights. Egyptian activists behind bars on uprising's anniversary . Given the film's portrayal of the military's repeated attacks on protesters, beginning in March 2011, it is difficult to understand the infatuation with Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and the army, a sentiment that extends to liberals such as author Alaa al-Aswany. Recently returned from Cairo, ""The Square"" producer Karim Amer said in a talkback session, ""People are beginning to wake up and recognize what the regime is doing to divide Egyptians."" In a tragic postscript to the film, Magdy Ashour currently is confined to his home -- a common fate for Brotherhood members -- unable to work for fear of arrest under the military's condemnation of  the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. This is ironic, since Magdy sided with the revolutionaries against Egypt's deposed president, Mohammed Morsy. The current Egyptian regime's policy of outlawing a movement with millions of Egyptian supporters, one that supplied essential social services to the poor, cannot end well. And where is the United States? As usual, it has no impact. Having consistently abandoned those fighting for the goals of the revolution, the U.S. has steadily weakened its position of influence. Now the U.S. speaks to the military to no avail. While Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel dials el-Sisi to discourage growing repression, gaining nothing from their conversations, the U.S. is vilified in the Egyptian media. ""The Square"" should be a painful reminder for the White House, Congress, and State Department of the nature of the military regime the U.S. continues to back, . Egyptians, who already know this well enough, do not have the opportunity to see the film: It languishes in the state censorship authority. And no wonder. The military-backed regime surely does not want Egyptians to see the juxtaposition of army leaders promising ""not to harm a single Egyptian"" with the brutal beatings inflicted on protesters. The Oscars have done what the White House has failed to do: Recognize the ongoing narrative of Egypt's revolution. Now the Egyptian authorities must allow their countrymen to see their own history.  There are encouraging signs that the Oscar nomination has prompted them to review the film's status.

"(CNN) -- On June 11, 1962, three Alcatraz inmates -- John Anglin, Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris -- attempted to leave the infamous San Francisco Bay island prison in a bold escape attempt involving dummy heads, chipped-through walls and a raft made of raincoats. They were never seen again. For years, Alcatraz aficionados -- not to mention the authorities -- have wondered whether the trio could have survived the attempt and made it to freedom. Now a Dutch study has shown that, if their timing was right, the inmates just might have done so. Based on models of tidal currents in the bay -- and inspired by an episode of the Discovery Channel's ""MythBusters"" -- the team of researchers showed that if the Anglin brothers and Morris left Alcatraz at midnight and headed north, they could have reached land. ""If they hit it exactly at midnight, the beautiful thing is that we see that they would have been sucked out towards the Golden Gate Bridge,"" Rolf Hut, one of the researchers, told the BBC, which first reported on the study. ""But the moment they were close to the Golden Gate would have been the moment the tide reverses. And that would give them a moment of slack tide, in which they could have reached marine headlands in the northern site of the Golden Gate Bridge,"" he said. The researchers put together a graphic for the best-case scenario: . The window, however, was narrow, Hut observed. If the three left before midnight, the tides would have pushed them toward the ocean, where they would have died of hypothermia, Hut said. And if they left after 1 a.m., the tides would have pushed them toward the East Bay, and they also would have probably died of hypothermia in the cold waters. Hut allows that they could have survived the latter departure, though they were likely to have been picked up by police since they would have made landfall after sunrise. That's the worst-case scenario: . Only one person, John Paul Scott, is known to have survived an Alcatraz escape attempt, and he was captured the next day. However, Scott's successful swim across the channel to San Francisco -- six months after the attempt by the Anglins and Morris -- made it feasible that others could have done so as well. It's unlikely, though possible, that the Anglin brothers and Morris are alive today if they survived. Clarence and John Anglin, who were bank robbers, would be 83 and 84, respectively. Morris, who had an extensive record, would be 88. Still, the case has remained open. At the time of a 2009 NPR report, the U.S. Marshals Service was still investigating the case, and though the FBI ended its investigation in 1979, a note on an archived FBI web page devoted to the case says that any leads can still be called in. Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary was closed on March 21, 1963. It's now a National Historic Landmark and is open to visitors.","Trio of Alcatraz escapees may have survived their journey, study says .

"Havana (CNN) -- Church bells rang out Wednesday afternoon in Havana, marking a major moment in history -- Cuba and the United States are renewing diplomatic relations after decades of ice-cold tension. Word of the massive change was met with passionate opinions and some protests in the United States. And tearful celebrations erupted in the streets of the island after President Raul Castro announced the news in a televised address. But there was uncertainty and some anger amid the joy. Dissident Cuban blogger Yusnaby Perez tweeted that his neighbor asked him whether a change in U.S.-Cuban trade relations would mean that he could finally afford to buy meat. Other dissidents worried that their concerns will now be overlooked. Yoani Sanchez, a well-known Cuban blogger, decried what she described as a carefully plotted victory for the Castro regime in the swap of detained U.S. contractor Alan Gross for Cuban spies imprisoned in America. ""With the main obstacle for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations eliminated, the only unknown is the next step,"" she wrote in a column for 14ymedio.com. ""Is the Cuban government planning another move to return to a position of force vis-a-vis the U.S. government? Or are all the cards on the table this time, before the weary eyes of a population that anticipates that the Castro regime will also win the next move."" Even with the next steps unclear, happiness spread quickly through a market in the heart of Cuba's capital, where crowds watched speeches from Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama announcing the news on TV screens. ""In the audience,"" 14ymedio reported, ""many threw kisses to Obama and hugged each other."" Angry debates erupt in Miami . In Miami, where the vast majority of the large population of Cuban exiles once fiercely opposed any change in the U.S. stance toward the island, reactions were split, mostly along generational lines. A rift over the embargo that political analysts have noted within the Cuban-American community was on full display. Angry debates erupted in the city's Little Havana neighborhood between groups of younger demonstrators who said they supported Obama's decision to exchange the prisoners and thaw diplomatic relations and older protesters who said they were opposed to the move. Outside the iconic Versailles Cafe, demonstrators shouted: ""Obama a coward! Coward, coward, coward!"" One held a sign that read: ""Obama administration conspiracy with Castro terrorist."" One man stood with an American flag around his neck, smiling and proudly holding a sign with Obama's face on it as other demonstrators yelled at him. A June poll by Florida International University found that more than half of Cuban-Americans surveyed in Miami support an end to the embargo and a solid majority of them also favor restoring diplomatic relations with Havana. Younger generations who immigrated more recently, analysts say, are more open to dialogue and have different priorities than older generations who came to the United States decades ago. George Davila told CNN en Español the time for change has come. ""I represent a generation of Cubans who are very interested in the future of Cuba. We think that the best days for Cuba have yet to come. And we think that in the end, the Cuban people need to stop being pieces in a game of chess,"" he said. For decades, they were pawns in the Cold War standoff between the United States and the Soviets, he said. Then, he said, they became pawns in the U.S. election politics as candidates jockeyed for Florida's 29 electoral votes and feared the political repercussions of reshaping U.S. policies toward Cuba. ""In the end, the 50 years of the embargo that we have had without having any type of dialogue with the Cuban government has not done anything to try to change the system,"" he said. ""But it has allowed the Cuban government to manipulate this status in order to be able to justify its actions."" Natalia Martinez said she can sense a generational divide. ""Being a relatively recent Miami re-transplant, I think I have an optimistic view,"" said Martinez of Roots of Hope, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization based in Miami that helps students and young professionals in Cuba to their peers in the U.S. to share information through the Internet and other technologies. There's value to how older Cuban-Americans feel, she said. But the conversation, she said, has shifted. ""It's more focused on what we (Cuba and the U.S.) can agree on as opposed to the things we disagree on."" 'I don't trust the Castro government' Some older Cubans, many of them exiles in Miami, were decidedly angry about the news. A crowd quickly grew outside the Versailles Cafe, and hours before Obama addressed the nation to explain the release of Gross and the change in policy, many were fuming. While happy about Gross' freedom, some said the price was too steep: the release of three Cuban intelligence agents convicted of espionage in 2001, and a sweeping change in America's diplomatic approach toward its communist neighbor. ""There is a long history here of people who have a lot of anger, people who have been hurt,"" said John Losada, who's been an exile since the 1960s. Miami Mayor Tomás Pedro Regalado, who came to the United States in the '60s, said he thinks Cuba will make more arrests and crack down even more on human rights after the United States changes its policy. The Castro government won't change its ways, he said. Miguel Saavedra, another exile, said there's a practical issue to consider: 70% of Cuban exiles ""don't support business to Cuba,"" he said. Easing relations with Cuba feels like a ""betrayal,"" Felix Gonzalez told CNN on Wednesday. The 76-year-old Cuban-American came to the U.S. in 1961 and had come to Versailles for his morning coffee. ""I don't trust the Castro government,"" he said. ""I will never."" But others in the United States seemed cautiously optimistic. ""It was a huge surprise for me,"" said Raúl Galván, a Cuban-American historian who also works for a public television station in Wisconsin. ""I know that they opened economic doors. But beyond that, we are still in a situation that is just beginning. There is a lot more to do still."" Galván, who's lived in the United States since the 1960s, told CNN en Español he was grateful that Obama had taken the steps to thaw relations with the Cuban government, and interested to see what happens next. ""The Cuban side of me,"" he said, ""is hoping that someday I can travel to Cuba freely."" Cuba Fast Facts .

"(CNN)Its name means ""bending over in pain."" It has no treatment or vaccine. Its symptoms resemble Dengue fever. And it has infected more than 1 million people -- 155 of them fatally -- since spreading to the Americas one year ago. The mosquito-borne Chikungunya virus has long been diagnosed in travelers returning from countries in Asia and Africa, where the disease is widespread. But in December 2013, the first people infected by mosquitoes local to the region were reported on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin. This was the first outbreak of the debilitating disease in the Western Hemisphere, health officials said. All countries in Central America have now reported local transmission of Chikungunya [pronounced chik-un-GOON-ya], and the United States had 11 confirmed cases of local infection this year as of December 12, all in Florida. There also have been 1,900 imported cases across the United States in returning travelers. ""It wasn't until 2013 that unfortunately a traveler resulted in local transmission of Chikungunya,"" said Erin Staples of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), referring to the people infected in Saint Martin. Those infected carry the virus in their bloodstream; it can then be picked up by mosquitoes as they bite, making them carriers. The virus has since spread rapidly and shows no signs of leaving, as ecological conditions are perfect for the disease to flourish. ""We knew it would spread,"" said Staples, a medical epidemiologist. The big question perplexing officials: Why now? Two mosquito species primed to the temperatures of Central and South America carry Chikungunya. The species -- Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus -- also carry the virus behind Dengue fever. ""Given the level of Dengue in the region, we knew there could be the same levels of Chikungunya,"" Staples said. Both diseases can cause joint pain and inflammation, headaches, rashes and fever, and can lead to death in rare cases. But this tropical disease with an exotic name (which originates from the African Makonde dialect) causes more intense joint pain and inflammation. For some people the pain can last for months or years, resulting in additional psychological strain. The lack of immunity among people living in the Americas provided a blank canvas for Chikungunya to spread throughout the population this year. As of December 12, more than 1.03 million people have been infected, in addition to the 155 who died, according to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). Almost all of the fatalities occurred in the Caribbean island countries of Guadeloupe and Martinique. ""Where we saw the biggest jump was after it reached the Spanish-speaking countries in the region,"" said Staples, referring to the weakened infrastructures and health systems of countries such as the Dominican Republic, which has reported more than 520,000 cases -- more than half of the overall outbreak and 5% of the island country's population. As South American countries approach their summer, numbers are expected to rise there as the mosquitoes flourish in the heat. ""Brazil, Peru, Paraguay are coming into their summer months and reporting their first local transmission,"" Staples said. Already, more than 2,000 people have been infected in Brazil. Is there cause for concern? Because infection with Chikungunya is rarely fatal, the issue of most concern to officials is the burden on health services and the impact of the debilitating symptoms on the economy. ""The high number of cases can overload health services,"" says Dr. Pilar Ramon-Pardo, regional adviser for PAHO, the regional office of the World Health Organization. Until recently, monitoring for Chikungunya was not part of routine surveillance in the region. ""Clinicians have to be ready to diagnose,"" she said . About 20% to 30% of cases are expected to become chronic, with symptoms such as arthritis and other rheumatic manifestations leading to physical disabilities, Ramon-Pardo said. Further long-term effects are psychological as people become more depressed and tired. All of this can result in missed work and lower school attendance, she said, hurting local economies. Is it here to stay? The warm climate of the region offers potential for Chikungunya levels to be maintained for years to come, just like Dengue fever. But areas of most concern are the tropics. ""The areas which have year-round favorable climate for the mosquito are at the greatest risk,"" says Dr. Laith Yakob of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which is monitoring the spread of the outbreak. While the climate and mosquitos have long been present, Ramon-Pardo said, ""we don't know why this is happening now."" She said globalization is likely to blame, with increased population movement from one country to another. This offers more opportunities for local mosquitos to bite infected humans. The CDC's Staples said she is temporarily at ease regarding numbers in the U.S. ""We're moving into fall and winter periods, which should see activity decrease,"" she said. Cold temperatures reduce mosquito survival rates. The rapid spread of Chikungunya this year also could help minimize future infections. ""Chikungunya will go through a region quite rapidly and create a level of population immunity which helps mitigate large outbreaks of the disease,"" Staples said. Unlike Dengue, infection with Chikungunya results in lifelong immunity. Like many other infections, Chikungunya could, however, remain in the background through animals capable of carrying the virus in their bloodstream and acting as so-called reservoirs of the disease. ""In Asia and Africa there is a transmission cycle in small mammals and monkeys,"" Ramon-Pardo said, meaning these animals keep the virus present within the population. ""In the Americas ... we don't know yet."" Those words --  ""we don't know"" -- resonate throughout the community of scientists and government officials trying to control the outbreak. The future risk of spread, levels of future immunity, risk from animal reservoirs, why this is only happening now, and the total economic impact are all unknown. ""Mathematical models are under construction by numerous research groups around the world to improve confidence over projections of future spread,"" said Yakob, whose team is modeling the disease.  As they work, control efforts continue. Getting it under control . When it comes to controlling Chikungunya, there are two main strategies -- reduce the likelihood of bites and remove the ever-biting mosquito. Prevention is the priority. Unlike the mosquitoes behind malaria, which bite at night, the species behind Chikungunya bite any time, day or night. Those living in affected areas are asked to use repellent, sleep under bed nets and wear long clothing to avoid getting bitten. The air conditioned and indoor environments of people living in the U.S. mean numbers are likely to stay low there. But mosquito control is at the heart of it all. Mass spraying of insecticides and removal of any sources of shallow water in which mosquitoes can breed are taking place across the continents. According to the CDC's Staples, Florida has been highly aggressive with its approach to control. ""We're only at 11 (cases) due to such proactive measures,"" Staples said. For now, prevention is all they have as officials wait and see how the outbreak pans out. ""There is no vaccine currently and no good antivirals, so we are trying to control the spread of the disease,"" Staples said. ""There are a lot of questions and only time will tell what we'll see for Chikungunya in the future."" Debilitating case of mosquito-borne chikungunya in U.S. Mosquito-borne virus chikungunya worries CDC .","In 2014 an outbreak of Chikungunya has spread across the Americas .

"(CNN)Let me say at the start that there is no way around the topic of nakedness in front of your children without getting personal and slightly uncomfortable. I'm already feeling somewhat tense as I type this. I joke that the only person who should have to see me naked is my husband. He signed up for it, right? My kids certainly didn't. A lifetime of body image issues means I'm not one to walk around naked at home. But I don't cover up around my daughters, 7 and 8, when I'm getting dressed or in the bathroom, either. I don't want them to think there is anything wrong with my body or theirs. And when they ask hilarious questions such as ""Mom, why do your boobs hang?,"" I can't help but laugh and use the opportunity as a chance to tell them my body has changed over time and theirs will, too. 'Brutally Honest': When is it OK to leave your teen home alone overnight? In conversations over email with mothers and fathers across the country and in Canada, it's clear there is no ""one size fits all'"" approach to the questions of whether it's OK to be naked in front of your kids and if there's an age when it's no longer OK. Rhonda Woods, a mother of three, says ever since her children, now 20, 13 and 13, were little, she and her husband have been teaching them not to be ashamed of their bodies. They have also never hidden their bodies from their kids, she said. ""As they get older, my husband is more discreet around our daughters and I am more discreet around our son. Not because we are uncomfortable, but because they may be,"" said Woods, a real estate agent in New Milford, Connecticut. ""So when it is time for me to undress, I tell whichever of my kids is in my room talking to me, that I plan to do so and they have the option to leave."" 'Brutally Honest': What if you don't like your kids' friends? Comfort is key . A common theme I heard from parents is comfort. If both you and your children are comfortable with you being naked in front of them, there isn't anything ""inherently wrong with that at all,"" said Avital Norman Nathman, who says her 8-year-old son is used to seeing her and her husband naked on occasion when they are getting dressed or in the shower. ""If my son were ever to say or even act as if he was uncomfortable by it, we would of course respect that,"" said Norman Nathman, editor of the motherhood anthology ""The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality"" and founder of the blog The Mamafesto. ""Nudity, when it's within your home and 100% nonsexualized, isn't going to traumatize a child, especially if you're all on the same page, are all consenting and are all comfortable with it."" Nancy Friedman, a New York City mom of two middle schoolers, said while every child is different, most kids make it clear when their mom or dad's nudity no longer works for them. 'Brutally Honest': Mean girls are getting younger . ""I think your kids let you know when it's time to stop being naked in front of them -- usually about the time they decide they don't want to be naked in front of you,"" said Friedman, co-founder of the video sharing site for tweens called KidzVuz. As children age, they certainly develop their own sense of modesty around others, said Micky Morrison, a mom of two in Islamorada, Florida, and founder of BabyWeightTV. ""But even my 12-year-old son doesn't hesitate to undress in front of me. I figure that he will one day, and that's OK,"" said Morrison. ""Perhaps one day he will avert his eyes or become uncomfortable with my nudity as well. And that's OK, too."" Amanda Rodriguez, a mom of three boys in Frederick, Maryland, said she reached a point with each of her sons, usually no later than age 5, when she thought it was no longer OK to be nude around them. ""I began to feel uncomfortable being naked in front of them because of the questions and the poking and prodding and search for Mommy's 'inside penis' -- that's what they thought a vagina was,"" said Rodriguez, founder of the blog Dude Mom. ""I don't think it makes them terrible people or scars them for life if they stumble into the bathroom while I'm going, but it's easily avoidable awkwardness none of us really needs to experience on a daily basis."" Terry Greenwald, a divorced father of three, puts himself solidly in the no-being-naked-in-front-of-kids' camp. ""It would be very difficult to teach children any sort of modesty and humility if a parent thought it OK to be naked in front of their children.  It also would bring up questions and conversations they might not be ready to handle,"" he said. Blogger: Why I want my sons to see me naked . A few months back, a post by blogger Rita Templeton about why she wants her four sons -- ages 2, 5, 6 and 9 -- to see her naked, was republished on The Huffington Post and went viral. Templeton said she wanted her sons to see what ""real"" women look like before they are bombarded with an ideal in the media that doesn't match reality. ""Before they are exposed to boobs that are as round and firm as cantaloupes and pictures of taut, airbrushed, dimple-less butts, I'm exposing them to a different kind of female body.  Mine,"" wrote Templeton, who blogs at Fighting Off Frumpy. Her words led to an onslaught of hate mail, nasty tweets and accusations she's sexualizing her sons, she said. Buzz Bishop, a father of two boys in Calgary, wrote a blog post of his own in part as a response to all the outrage. He says he has been playing games called ""naked baby"" and ""naked daddy"" at bath time since his children were little while at the same time he teaches his kids not to stare when they are in the open shower in the men's bathroom at their neighborhood pool. ""Rita's doing what works for (her). I'm doing what works for me. You're doing what works for you. And we're all just trying to teach our kids a little respect for each other, and themselves,"" said Bishop, who writes about parenting on his blog Dad Camp. There doesn't seem to be much science to help guide us on whether it's better or worse for your child, or it makes no difference at all, if they see you naked. I couldn't find many studies when I searched for them, and those I found had conflicting findings. For instance, one study found no negative impact on adolescents who regularly saw their parents naked at ages 3 and 6, but another study found that parental nudity when kids were ages 6 to 11 resulted in more permissive attitudes about sex and increased sexual frequency. For some parents, like Maryellen, a mom of two young girls on Long Island, who only wanted to use her first name, it's all about convenience. ""I'll be honest. Sometimes it's easier and faster just to pull them into the shower with me,"" she said. ""But my girls are 4 and 6. A year from now I may not be doing it any longer. By then, they may be showering by themselves (dare to hope?)"" Do you think it's OK to be naked in front of your kids? Share your thoughts with Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","In ""Brutally Honest"" video series, Kelly Wallace tackles provocative parenting questions .

"A 34-year-old man originally charged in the kidnapping of a New Hampshire teen is now facing 205 additional charges, according to two grand jury rulings. Nathaniel E. Kibby, arrested in July and charged with one count of felony kidnapping, is facing a litany of charges including aggravated felonious sexual assault, witness tampering, second degree assault, criminal threatening, felonious use of a firearm, indecent exposure and kidnapping. Court papers released Wednesday say Kibby showed the victim a rifle and told her he could hurt her family, bystanders and police if she provided information about his identity. Additionally, Kibby is accused of forcing the victim to wear an anti-bark shock dog collar for a period, scarring her neck. CNN does not report the names of alleged sexual assault victims. The kidnapping case drew national attention when the then-14-year-old victim went missing in fall 2013. Two months after her disappearance, a letter purported to be from the missing teenager was sent to her mother, sparking fears she could be in danger. The mystery deepened about her ordeal when she turned up safe more than nine months after she was last seen with few additional details given by authorities. Kibby will be arraigned on January 8 in Coos County, where the victim was held, and January 9 in Carroll County, where the victim was taken, according to prosecutors. In a statement released after her return in July, the victim thanked those who searched for her while she was missing. ""My gratitude is beyond words. It's an incredible feeling to be home and I believe in my heart that your hopes and prayers played a major role in my release,"" she said.","Kibby, arrested in July, faces more than 200 charges .

"Five men are tasting freedom for the first time in years -- including one President Barack Obama described as ""one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba"" -- in a historic deal between the U.S. and Cuba announced Wednesday. The still unidentified spy was released along with Alan Gross, the American subcontractor held for five years in Cuba despite persistent and very public pushes for his release. The intelligence agent was part of a deal that exchanged him for three convicted Cuban spies who are now back home in Cuba. All five of the released men are now part of a bigger story, one that speaks to the long-held rivalry between the United States and Cuba that is now being rewritten as the two countries revamp diplomatic relations. Who are these men? What did they do? And what can they look forward to, now that they're free? Obama signals overhaul of Cuba relations . RELEASED BY CUBA . Unnamed U.S. intelligence agent . The most significant person to be freed may be the only one who hasn't been named, and about whom least is known. He is a U.S. intelligence agent who spent nearly 20 years in a Cuban prison before his release. But why? ""This man -- whose sacrifice has been known to only a few -- provided America with the information that led us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today as well as other spies in the United States,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""This man is now safely on our shores."" According to the office of the Director of National Intelligence, this Cuban national provided the U.S. government with information that ""was instrumental in the identification and disruption of several Cuban intelligence operatives in the United States and ultimately led to ... successful federal espionage prosecutions."" Specifically, the U.S. intelligence office tied this unnamed spy to the conviction of one-time Defense Intelligence Agency senior analyst Ana Belen Montes, who was sentenced to 25 years after pleading guilty of spying for the Cuban government in 2002. He's also tied to the case of ex-State Department official Walter Kendall Myers and his wife Gwendolyn, who pleaded guilty in 2009 for illegally aiding the Cuban government for decades. The unnamed agent also played a role in helping federal authorities go after the Florida-based Wasp Network, including members of the Cuban Five. Three of those five were released in exchange for this intelligence agent as part of Wednesday's deal. ""Securing his release from prison after 20 years --  in a swap for three of the Cuban spies he helped put behind bars -- is fitting closure to this Cold World chapter of U.S.-Cuban relations,"" the DNI office said. Alan Gross . Though the 65-year-old Gross has been detained  for less time than the others freed as part of the U.S.-Cuba exchange, his plight probably has been the most widely reported, thanks to his family's public campaign for his release. A subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development, Gross went to Cuba purportedly to bring the Internet to the Caribbean nation's small Jewish community -- despite the Havana government's restrictions on Internet access. His two-day, March 2011 trial took place behind closed doors, ending with his conviction for allegedly trying to set up an Internet network for Cuban dissidents ""to promote destabilizing activities and subvert constitutional order."" This month, his wife Judy Gross said her husband spent ""five years ... literally wasting away. Alan is done."" She urged U.S. President Barack Obama to bring Alan Gross back home, saying, ""otherwise, it will be too late."" While the others were swapped as part of a deal, the Cuban government says that Gross was let go unilaterally on ""humanitarian"" grounds. Gross: 'I'm free' RELEASED BY THE UNITED STATES . Gerardo Hernandez . Hernandez led the group known as Cuban Five, who were arrested in 1998 and convicted of espionage in 2001 for gathering intelligence in Miami. He got special treatment in U.S. courts -- two life sentences, in fact -- compared to the others charged. This came after guilty verdicts on charges that included conspiracy to commit murder for engineering the downing of two planes flown in 1996 by the exile group Brothers to the Rescue. According to the National Committee to Free the Cuban Five, Hernandez and the others ""were falsely accused by the U.S. government of committing espionage conspiracy against the United States, and other related charges. The Five's actions were never directed at the U.S. government."" That website claims the now 49-year-old, Havana-born Hernandez is a cartoonist-humorist and a Cuban military veteran who, after his conviction, was held in a federal prison in Victorville, California. He went on 54 combat missions, one of them as part of Cuban forces fighting against apartheid-era South African forces in Angola. Luis Medina . Also known as Ramon Labanino, Medina belonged to the Cuban Five. During their trial, he and others said their mission was to gather intelligence in Miami to defend Cuba from anti-Castro groups they feared would attack the island. He got life plus 18 years, though his sentence was changed to 30 years in late 2009, according to the National Committee to Free the Cuban Five website. Medina was serving his sentence in Ashland, Kentucky. The now 51-year-old grew up in Cuba's capital, even graduating with first class honors with an economics degree from the University of Havana, the Free the Cuban Five site says. A talented athlete, he has three daughters -- ages 16 to 25 -- from two different marriages, according to the site. Antonio Guerrero . Guerrero was the other member of the Cuban Five to be released -- not including other members Ruben Campa and Rene Gonzalez, who was let go in 2011. Unlike the other five, Guerrero was born in Miami in 1958, though he and his parents moved to their native Cuba the following year, says the National Committee to Free the Cuban Five website. An airfield construction engineer schooled in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union. He proceeded to work on the expansion of the airport in Santiago de Cuba, and in his free time engaged in art and poetry, according to the Free the Cuban Five website. Re-sentenced in 2009 to nearly 22 years, according to that site, Guerrero leaves incarceration in Marianna, Florida, to reunite with his two sons, ages 22 and 27.","U.S. agency says freed U.S. intelligence agent was a Cuban national .

"A prominent Saudi cleric has created a storm of controversy by appearing on a popular television show alongside his wife, whose face was uncovered, challenging a fundamental religious tradition in the conservative kingdom. Sheikh Ahmed al-Ghamdi once headed the religious police in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, but now says the full-face veil imposed on all women in the country is not imperative in Islam. ""No one is saying that it is not allowed for a woman to cover her face, but I am saying that it is not obligatory and I have evidence in jurisprudence of this,"" al-Ghamdi told Badria al-Bishr, the female host of the television program. He explained that people became confused about ancient texts that mentioned the head scarf and the robe that women were commanded to wear. ""Later, people confused the hijab, which was imposed only on the wives of the Prophet Mohammed, with what Allah imposed on Muslim women in general,"" al-Ghamdi said. The bold statements contest Saudi Arabia's image as a nation of women clad in loose black garb known as abayas and peering through a face veil, or niqab, from behind the required male guardian. ""My message to Sheikh al-Ghamdi is to fear God,"" Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Sheikh told the Saudi news site Sabq. ""You should ask repentance from God, and to back away from this mistake before you meet God with these sins."" Although the country's laws do not require the niqab, women who appear in public with uncovered faces may face harassment from religious police or even bystanders for ignoring the custom. ""Happy now? Every mobile phone now has a picture of your wife, you pimp,"" one outraged post on Twitter read. On the show, Al-Ghamdi's wife was dressed in a traditional black abaya, but also wore makeup, sported stylish sunglasses and carried a Michael Kors purse as she spoke about the struggles her family faced. ""This definitely affects us both positively and negatively,"" said Jawaher bint Al-Sheikh Ali.  ""Our children sometimes complain that fellow students and even teachers challenge them and start arguing with them. Sometimes this affects them psychologically."" In the past, the controversial cleric -- who is despised by more conservative religious figures -- has said that women may go out in public without a male guardian, wear makeup and even mingle with the opposite sex in appropriate environments, all violations of custom in Saudi Arabia. ""When Sheikh Al-Ghamdi and I put this episode on air, our aim was not to clash with social beliefs and established norms which were not discussed before but to create a balance in opinions within our society,"" al-Bishr, the host of the program, told sister network Al Arabiya on Monday. A photograph of al-Ghamdi sitting between his wife, who wore colored clothing, and a blonde woman in a sleeveless dress -- which was allegedly snapped during a visit to Euorpe -- spread on social media as critics tried to discredit the sheikh. The longstanding debate plays out beyond the Gulf state and across the Islamic world, where most mainstream religious leaders argue that the face veil stems from tribal tradition rather than Sharia law.  That's also the view of Cairo's al-Azhar University, the highest seat of Sunni Islam scholarship. ""Some foolish people need to stop their accusations to senior Salafi scholars and describing them with ignorance,"" Sheikh Adel al-Kalbani, a former senior imam of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, said in a tweet defending the couple's television appearance.  ""Choose what you want and hold your tongue."" After online users shared the weekend interview widely, racking up over a million views on YouTube, al-Ghamdi told the newspaper al-Watan he has received death threats for his wife's public appearance. ""For those who accuse me of wanting celebrity or fame, accuse me of worse than that, this is not the issue,"" al-Ghamdi said to critics in the Saturday interview. ""Keep your opinions, but do not judge me on them. Instead, debate me on my argument.""","Sheikh Ahmed al-Ghamdi was formerly the head of religious police in Mecca .
He's no stranger to controversy: He's said previously that women can wear makeup .

"The San Francisco 49ers released defensive end Ray McDonald on Wednesday amid allegations of sexual assault. ""While this organization has a strong belief in due process and has demonstrated that over time, Ray has demonstrated a pattern of poor decision-making that has led to multiple distractions for this organization and this football team that can no longer be tolerated,"" General Manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. According to San Jose Police, a search warrant has been served at McDonald's home to investigate the allegations. No arrests have been made, and McDonald has not been charged. The NFL, which announced revisions to its personal conduct policy on December 10, confirmed it will investigate. ""We are looking into it,"" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said to CNN. The San Jose Police Department said that on Tuesday, it received a call from a hospital regarding a possible sexual assault victim who was receiving treatment. The victim alleged she was possibly sexually assaulted the day before. The preliminary investigation revealed the alleged suspect was McDonald. Last month, the Santa Clara District Attorney's Office decided it did not have enough evidence to charge McDonald in a domestic violence case against his pregnant fiancee. McDonald was arrested August 31 in that alleged incident, just days after the NFL had once again updated its personal conduct policy in response to criticism on how the league handled the discipline for then-Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice. The investigations section under the updated NFL personal conduct policy includes this language concerning a potential violation: ""Whenever the league office becomes aware of a possible violation of the Personal Conduct Policy, it will undertake an investigation, the timing and scope of which will be based upon the particular circumstances of the matter. ""Any such investigation may be conducted by NFL Security, independent parties, or by a combination of the two.  In cases that are also being investigated by law enforcement, the league will work to cooperate with and to avoid any conflict or interference with the law enforcement proceedings.""","Ray McDonald has ""demonstrated a pattern of poor decision-making,"" says team's GM .

"First lady Michelle Obama's drive to stop a Republican-led effort to slow adoption of nutrition standards for school meals, a centerpiece of her anti-obesity ""Let's Move"" campaign, was dealt a setback in Congress. Democrats aligned with Mrs. Obama on the issue failed on Thursday to strip the proposal from a $142.5 billion Agriculture Department spending bill, which was approved by the Appropriations Committee and sent to the full House for consideration. The controversial plan offered by Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama would give schools struggling financially an extra year to comply with rules approved by Congress in 2010 to limit fat and salt and promote fruits, vegetables and whole grains. ""I want to be clear that everybody supports healthy lunches and meals for children, but the bottom line is the schools are finding the regulations to be too much too quick,"" Aderholt said during consideration of the measure by the appropriations panel. ""School districts need more time to implement the changes."" An amendment proposed by Democratic Rep. Sam Farr of California to strip Aderholt's language from the bill failed 29-22 on a party line vote. ""It gives schools an opt-out saying you don't have to participate in the school lunch program cause it's hard. Well, we don't tell kids, 'Look you don't have to take math if it's hard or science if it's hard. You don't have do P.E. if it's hard,'"" Farr said. ""This opt out for nutrition is just the wrong way to go particularly at this moment in American history when we're really trying to figure out how we can raise a healthier society,"" Farr said. Mrs. Obama's strong pushback on a legislative issue marks a rare political foray. She has promoted healthy eating and exercise through her White House garden and her ""Let's Move"" campaign for years, but she has never previously inserted herself so deeply into a congressional debate. She has taken a public stance on the bill and urged Democrats, health advocates and ordinary people to fight the waiver and other proposed changes to nutrition programs. ""Remember a few years ago when Congress declared that the sauce on a slice of pizza should count as a vegetable in school lunches?"" she wrote in an opinion piece published in the New York Times on Thursday. ""You don't have to be a nutritionist to know that this doesn't make much sense. Yet, we're seeing the same thing happening again with these new efforts to lower nutrition standards in our schools. Our children deserve so much better than this,"" she said. Mrs. Obama hosted a roundtable on school meals on Tuesday and an off-the-record conference call with advocates last week, and her office says she is not backing down on this issue. Farr hopes the waiver language can ultimately be defeated in the full House. Similar legislation in the Senate does not include the waiver language. If it survives a House vote and the Senate approves its version of agriculture spending without it, then the two chambers would have to resolve the issue through negotiation.","Michelle Obama is fighting GOP-led effort to slow adoption of nutrition standards .

"(CNN) -- In the heart of Belgrade, the vibrant and resilient capital of Serbia, a slow and colorful transformation is taking place. Once ugly and industrial, the historic neighborhood of Savamala has emerged in recent years as the thriving epicenter of the city's cultural life. Following decades of neglect, Savamala is now blossoming back to life as a diverse crowd of artists and entrepreneurs have poured in to reclaim the area and transform its run-down warehouses and abandoned spaces into hubs of creativity. At the center of this urban remake is Mikser House, a previously derelict state-owned garage that has now become a booming cultural space showcasing the best of Balkan art, thought and design. ""It's a roof for many different activities,"" says Maja Lalic, the creative force behind Mikser House. ""It's basically connecting creative people of very different disciplines but with a similar goal and desire to be productive and constructive,"" continues Lalic, an Ivy League-educated architect. ""These small-scale skills of surviving and being able to make something out of nothing, this kind of bitter-sweet attitude to life, and we used to say 'who if not us,' and 'when if not now.'"" Rich history . Such a transformation is not new in Belgrade, a city that has been destroyed and rebuilt some 40 times throughout its long and tumultuous history. Lying at the confluence of the great Danube and Sava rivers, Belgrade -- home today for some 1.5 million people -- is strategically located at the crossroads between Eastern and Western Europe and a meeting point of different civilizations. Nowhere is Belgrade's historical and cultural significance more evident than in the imposing ancient fortress that towers over the point where the Danube and Sava rivers mingle. Standing in some form since the second century on top of a cliff-like ridge, the sprawling castle has over the years sheltered Serbian, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman troops -- to name just a few. ""Belgrade was so many times conquered, pulled down and built again, so, that is why we have so many layers and every of those people left its marks on the ground of this city,"" says art historian Bojana Ibrajter Gazibara, surrounded by a cluster of ancient statues and elaborate headstones that dot an old gunpowder storage room deep inside the fortress. Breathtaking scenery . Now a historical monument that encompasses a large park, the fortress is a popular destination for locals and tourists thanks to its charming walking paths and spectacular river views. It's also the ideal location for Dragan Trifunovic, the owner/pilot of Helivideo, who often comes here to fly his camera-mounted drone and capture Belgrade's grand picture -- as well as its continuous rebuilding. ""When I was kid I always dreamed how it would be nice to be able to fly and to see what birds can see, and with this equipment, my dreams came true,"" says Trifunovic, adding that the breathtaking shots give people more pride in their city.

"The NSA has released an e-mail exchange between Edward Snowden and the agency's general counsel's office, countering a claim the former contractor made in an interview this week. Speaking to NBC News in an interview that aired Wednesday, Snowden claimed that he'd reached out to the office while working as an National Security Agency contractor to report what he saw as an abuse of power by the agency. ""I reported that there were real problems with the way the NSA was interpreting its legal authorities,"" he told NBC's Brian Williams. In the e-mail exchange released by the NSA Thursday, Snowden requests clarification about training material he'd received, asking whether executive orders can override federal laws. The general counsel's office responded to Snowden's e-mail, saying that executive orders have the ""force and effect of law"" but cannot override a statute. ""Please give me a call if you would like to discuss further,"" the e-mail concludes. In his interview with NBC, Snowden said that after raising concerns, he essentially was told to ""stop asking questions."" He described his contact with the general counsel's office as an indication of what he said were his efforts to go through official channels to raise his concerns about the NSA before leaking classified documents. In a statement Thursday, the NSA said the e-mail exchange it released was the only communication found and there was no evidence Snowden followed up. ""We have searched for additional indications of outreach from him in those areas and to date have not discovered any engagements related to his claims,"" the statement said. Snowden said Thursday that the e-mail exchange released by the NSA was ""a strangely tailored and incomplete leak,"" telling The Washington Post that it ""only shows the NSA feels it has something to hide."" ""If the White House is interested in the whole truth, rather than the NSA's clearly tailored and incomplete leak today for a political advantage, it will require the NSA to ask my former colleagues, management, and the senior leadership team about whether I, at any time, raised concerns about the NSA's improper and at times unconstitutional surveillance activities,"" Snowden told the newspaper.

The infamous property index says construction booms that give rise to the world's tallest buildings are the harbingers of economic busts. On July 20, developers celebrated the groundbreaking of Sky City in the southern Chinese city of Changsha. It is set to be completed in 2014 and at 838 meters it would overshadow the Burj Khalifa in Dubai -- currently the world's tallest building -- by 10 meters. ""The Skyscraper Index has a good 150-year correlation between the world's tallest buildings and economic slowdowns and recessions,"" says Andrew Lawrence, pioneer of the Skyscraper Index and head of Hong Kong and China property research at CIMB Group. ""For China, there is no reason that correlation will change."" China starts work on world's tallest building . According to the Skyscraper Index, the opening of every single ""world's tallest"" building in the past century has coincided with an economic downturn in that country. In the United States, builders installed the spire on New York's Chrysler Building on October 23,1929 making it the tallest building in the world at 319 meters. Five days later, the Wall Street Crash wiped nearly 13% off the stock market and precipitated the country's Great Depression. In March 1996, Malaysia's Petronas Towers were completed making it the world's tallest building at 452 meters. Just sixteen months later, the Asian financial crisis hit the country and region. Malaysia's stock market lost half of its value by the end of 1997. And in Dubai, the 828-meter Burj Khalifa received its spire in October 2009. Two months later, a massive debt crisis slammed the Middle Eastern metropolis as the global financial crisis roiled world markets. Similar economic storms have followed other imposing structures soon after their construction, including the Empire State Building and World Trade Center in New York and the Taipei 101 in Taiwan. Does skyscraper boom herald economic doom? Lawrence believes that both skyscrapers and economic busts are often closely associated with large expansions of credit. ""Like the one we saw in China post-2008,"" he says. In 2008, as the global financial crisis took hold, China launched a period of loose monetary policies to jump start its economy with liquidity and the hope of spurring investment. Many analysts say those policies seeded a credit boom of easy money and a building boom of unneeded or ostentatious properties that are now coming back to haunt constructors and investors. As skyscrapers rise, markets fall . ""China will be building over 40% of the world's skyscrapers over the next four years so clearly there's a building bubble,"" says Lawrence. Last week, the final beam was hoisted on the main structure of Shanghai Tower, which will soon become China's tallest building. At more than 600 meters, the building will be the second highest in the world, below the Burj Khalifa and ahead of Taiwan's Taipei 101 building. ""They certainly were not bashful about wanting (one of) the tallest buildings ... here in Shanghai,"" says Art Gensler, founder of the Gensler global design and architecture group. ""They wanted something that was a symbol, and I believe this building will be the symbol of China."" Meanwhile, anxiety is ramping up about what a collapse in China's building boom might bring. ""The China story has taken a serious turn for the worse,"" wrote Peking University finance professor and China expert Michael Pettis, in a July op-ed for CNN. ""China, it now seems, is about to collapse, and along the way it may well bring the world economy down with it."" If that were to happen, China's Sky City -- with a nearly $1.5 billion price tag -- could be the country's biggest landmark to its property largesse. In July, official data showed the country's economic growth slowed to 7.5% in the second quarter of this year -- its slowest pace in nine months, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Over the past three decades China had an average GDP growth rate of 10%.","China's skyscraper boom to bring economic doom, if history is precedent .

"REDMOND, Washington (CNN) -- Should a bridge that would connect two campuses at Microsoft's headquarters be funded with $11 million from the federal stimulus package? An artist's rendering shows how the proposed bridge would be constructed over a busy highway. Critics of using stimulus money for the bridge say it would give the software giant a break on a pet project. They also say it serves as a warning sign of how some stimulus money is not being used to finance new projects but is being diverted to public works already under way. Supporters argue the bridge is an ideal public-private partnership that will benefit an entire community while fulfilling the stimulus package's goal of getting people back to work. ""It's going create just under 400 jobs for 18 months constructing the bridge,"" says Redmond Mayor John Marchione. ""It's also connecting our technical sector with our retail and commercial sectors so people can cross the freeway to shop and help traffic flow.""  See a larger image of the proposed bridge » . Marchione applied for federal stimulus money after costs jumped on the project from $25 million to $36 million. Marchione says the increase in costs were due to a rise in construction prices and because the bridge will be built on a diagonal in order to connect Microsoft's original East campus with a newer West campus that are split by a public highway. Microsoft is hardly getting the bridge for free. The company is contributing $17.5 million or a little less than half the tab of the $36 million bridge, which would be open for public use. And even though the bridge goes from a parking lot behind Microsoft's West campus across a highway to an entrance of Microsoft's East campus, Marchione says, people other than Microsoft employees would use the overpass. ""We're not a one-company town,"" Marchione says. ""Our traffic studies show that Microsoft traffic would be about 42 percent of the bridge, yet Microsoft is paying for about 50 percent of the bridge, so we think we are getting fair value. ""The United States taxpayer is leveraging their dollars, and I think everyone is getting a fair deal."" But a watchdog group monitoring how stimulus money is being spent says the taxpayer in this case is getting ripped off. ""This is $11 million where we are substituting public money for private money, and that means there's some other project that would have a greater benefit than a bridge to Microsoft that's not being built,"" says Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. But without the stimulus money, Marchione counters, the bridge may not have been built. Microsoft had ""capped out"" its contribution to the project, he explains. And the economic tough times have affected even the biggest companies. ""Microsoft laid off 5,000 people in January,"" Marchione points out. Ellis doesn't buy it. ""Let's face it. Microsoft is one of the most lucrative companies in the country,"" Ellis says. ""They could have easily funded this out of pocket change. This is really about getting while the getting is good. Uncle Sam has a big wallet that's there for the taking, and Redmond wanted to take it -- and Microsoft was happy to let them pick up that part of the tab."" Microsoft did not respond to CNN requests for an interview on the bridge project. But in a posting online, Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith wrote: ""As the largest employer in Redmond, Microsoft takes its responsibility to the surrounding community seriously. We have spent over $50 million to assist the City of Redmond and other local governments with street construction, transit facilities, water and sewer facilities and fire equipment."" Last week, Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire certified 138 projects, including the bridge, to receive stimulus funding. Construction is expected to begin in June. Michael Ennis of the Washington Policy Center, a Seattle-based not-for-profit group that advises policy makers, said there are many reasons the bridge project is a good one. ""Any time you can include the private sector in funding transportation projects, it's a win-win situation,"" Ennis explains. ""The state has a monopoly on our roads system. Even if Microsoft wanted to pay for this project on their own, legally they are required to work with the public sector."" But Ennis also says the bridge does not fit with the kind of projects the stimulus plan is meant to bankroll. ""This project would have moved forward regardless of having the federal money or not, so it doesn't have any additional benefit to the economy,"" he says. As he pedaled on his bicycle to work, one Microsoft employee saw the issue in much simpler terms. ""It's going to cut about two miles off my ride each day,"" he said.","Project would build bridge between Microsoft's two campuses .

"(CNN)It was a shocking and gruesome scene: Police officers in hazmat suits retrieving dead infants among ""mounds of used diapers and feces"" from a Massachusetts home back in September. Three bodies in total were found amid the squalor at 23 St. Paul Street in Blackstone, a town on the Rhode Island border, and on Tuesday, their mother was charged with murder in the deaths of two of them. Erika Murray, 31, was indicted on nine charges in all, according to Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early. Those charges included neglect, abuse, reckless endangerment, concealing a fetal death and even animal cruelty in addition to the murder charges. She's being held on $1 million bail. Her boyfriend, who also lived at 23 St. Paul, was also indicted Tuesday, but not on charges of murder. Ray Rivera, 38, was indicted on two counts of assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury, two counts of reckless endangerment of a child, two counts of cruelty to animals and one count of cultivating marijuana. He is being held on $100,000 bail. ""He's making absolutely no statement at this time other than to absolutely deny these allegations,"" Rivera's attorney Nicole Longton said according to CNN affiliate WHDH. Father says he was unaware of the children . Both Rivera and Murray maintain that he not only never knew about the three infants he fathered that died in his home, he  also was somehow unaware of two of the four living ones that the state removed from his 1,150-square-foot home. DNA tests determined that Rivera was the father of all seven, according to WHDH. ""It is a mystery to me how Mr. Rivera could have failed to notice (the) numerous pregnancies (of) the woman with whom he shared a bed,"" Murray's attorney told CNN in September. ""It's a mystery to me how he could have failed to realize that there were two children living under the same roof as him, and he didn't know about it."" That attorney, Keith Halpern, told CNN Tuesday that according to Murray, only one of the three infants was born alive, and it lived only a very brief time. ""(Murray) put it down for a nap, she left it alone for an hour or two and when she came back, it wasn't breathing,"" he said. Halpern said he had not yet read the grand jury proceedings, but it was his understanding that ""there was no evidence presented indicating Erika had done anything to cause the death of any of the children,"" and that the medical examiner ""testified that there was no determination made regarding the cause or means of death."" Early said the murder charges stem from the two infants who were found dressed in onesies and diapers, but according to Halpern, that is not an indication that they were ever alive. ""That is nothing more than an inference that the baby was ever alive."" CNN affiliate WCVB reported in October that the skeleton of one of the three infants was found stuffed inside a backpack inside the closet of the bedroom shared by the two children Rivera knew about.","Mother charged with murder months after dead infants found in squalid home .

"North Korea said Thursday that it plans to carry out a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches, all of which it said are a part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. The North's National Defense Commission said the moves would feed into an ""upcoming all-out action"" that would target the United States, ""the sworn enemy of the Korean people."" Carried by the state media, the comments are the latest defiant flourish from the reclusive North Korean regime, whose young leader, Kim Jong Un, has upheld his father's policy of pursuing a military deterrent and shrugging off international pressure. U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said Thursday there are no ""outward indications"" that North Korea is about to conduct a nuclear test, but he admitted it would be hard to determine that in advance. ""They have the capability, frankly, to conduct these tests in a way that makes it very difficult to determine whether or not they are doing it,"" he said in a Pentagon press conference. ""We are very concerned with North Korea's continuing provocative behavior,"" Panetta said, but he added that the United States is ""fully prepared"" to deal with any provocations. Read more: U.N. Security Council slams North Korea, expands sanctions . North Korea's statement followed a U.N. Security Council resolution submitted by the United States and approved Tuesday that condemned a recent rocket launch by the North and expanded existing sanctions. Pyongyang's threatening statement ""should have been the expected outcome"" from the U.N. decision, said Daniel Pinkston, senior analyst for the International Crisis Group covering Northeast Asia. ""I think they are completely outraged and insulted by it,"" he said. North Korea's statement prompted France and Great Britain to express exasperation with the secretive regime. Britain's mission to the United Nations called on North Korean leaders to ""refrain from further provocation."" France said it ""deplores"" North Korea's statement, telling its leaders that they need not to threaten, but instead to work toward dismantling their nuclear and missile programs. Read more: North Korea silences doubters, raises fears with rocket launch . In addition to Panetta's statement, the United States added sanctions against more North Korean bank officials and a business linked to the regime's nuclear weapons program. The Treasury Department announcement targets two Beijing-based representatives of Tanchon Commercial Bank and a company -- Leader (Hong Kong) International Trading Limited -- that the U.S. government says shipped machinery and equipment in support of North Korea's nuclear program. The organizations are ""part of the web of banks, front companies and government agencies that support North Korea's continued proliferation activities,"" said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. Read more: N. Korea's launch causes worries about nukes, Iran and the Pacific . ""By continuing to expose these entities, and the individuals who assist them, we degrade North Korea's ability to use the international financial system for its illicit purposes,"" he said. North Korea, which often issues bellicose statements in its state media, said Thursday that it rejects all Security Council resolutions concerning it, describing the most recent resolution as ""the most dangerous phase of the hostile policy"" toward it. Read more: U.S. official: North Korea likely deceived U.S., allies before launching rocket . Analyst: Threat meant as a deterrence . The threats toward the United States, a constant theme in the North's propaganda, have more to do with deterrence than a desire for full conflict, Pinkston said. ""I don't believe they have the capability, the intention or the will to invade or destroy the United States,"" he said. ""They wish to deter interference from the U.S. or any outside powers."" Read more: North Korea's rocket launches cost $1.3 billion . North Korea's successful rocket launch last month nonetheless changed the strategic calculations for the United States, showing that the North's missile program is advancing despite an array of heavy sanctions imposed on it. Analysts say it still has a lot of work to do to master the technology necessary to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile or accurately target it. At the same time, Pyongyang has been hinting for a while that a new nuclear test could be in the cards. Read more: South Korean officials: North Korean rocket could hit U.S. mainland . Just before the North sent out its latest hostile statement Thursday, a U.S. State Department official was telling reporters in Seoul that Washington hoped Pyongyang wouldn't go ahead. ""We think that that would be a mistake, obviously,"" said Glyn Davies, the U.S. special envoy on North Korea. ""We call on North Korea, as does the entire international community, not to engage in any further provocations."" North Korea has carried out two previous nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, both of which were condemned by the United Nations. Read more: Huge crowds gather in North Korean capital to celebrate rocket launch . Pyongyang didn't say Thursday when exactly it would carry out a third test, but it could happen ""at any time,"" according to Pinkston. He said it is hard for anybody outside the North Korean nuclear sector to know whether the country is technically ready to carry out the test, but that politically, ""it seems an appropriate time."" Demands unlikely to sway North . South Korean defense officials said last year that they believed the North was in a position to carry out a new test whenever leaders in Pyongyang gave the green light. North Korea's nuclear program is ""an element of threat to peace not only for Northeast Asia but also for the world,"" Park Soo-jin, deputy spokeswoman for the South Korean Unification Ministry, said Thursday. ""North Korea should immediately stop its nuclear test and other provocation and should choose a different path by cooperating with the international community,"" Park said. That appears unlikely at this stage, though. After a failed long-range rocket launch in April, North Korea ignored international condemnation and carried out a second attempt last month. That one succeeded in putting a satellite in orbit, Pyongyang's stated objective. But the launch was widely considered to be a test of ballistic missile technology. And it remains unclear whether the satellite, which the North insists is for peaceful purposes, is functional. Both North Korea's previous nuclear tests took place weeks or months after long-range rocket launches. Those tests were carried out under the rule Kim Jong Il, the deceased father of the current leader, and the man who channeled huge amounts of money into North Korea's nuclear and missile development programs. Kim Jong Il died in December 2011 after 17 years in power, during which the North Korean people became increasingly impoverished and malnourished. Economically, the country relies heavily on trade with its major ally, China. China, which voted in favor of the U.N. Security Council resolution this week, appealed for calm on Thursday. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei urged North Korea and the West to ""keep calm, remain cautious and refrain from any action that might escalate the situation in the region."" The office of the South Korean president-elect, Park Geun-hye, said Friday that she would soon send a delegation to visit the United States. ""Issues of common interest will be discussed,"" said Yoon Chang-jung, a spokesman for Park, without specifying whether that included North Korea.

"World outrage grew Saturday as details emerged about an attack in the Syrian village of Houla, which left more than 90 people dead, including nearly three dozen children, according to the United Nations. U.N. observers went to Houla and viewed the bodies, a day after opposition activists reported a massacre there at the hands of the Syrian regime. The activists said entire families were killed. ""Whoever started, whoever responded and whoever took part in this deplorable act of violence should be held responsible,"" Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the head of the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria, said in a statement. Thirty-two children under the age of 10 and more than 60 adults were killed Friday, the statement read. Circumstances that led to the deaths are unclear, he said. Later, Mood told CNN that observers counted 85 bodies and that 34 of the dead were children under the age of 10. The discrepancy with the earlier number could not immediately be explained. Observers confirmed the use of artillery and tank shells, Mood said. ""This indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is unacceptable and unforgivable. The killing of innocent children and civilians needs to stop,"" said the major general. He stressed that unarmed U.N. observers are just ""one small ingredient"" in the effort to end the ongoing violence in Syria. ""At some point, obviously, there will be a discussion about other alternatives and other ways forward, but that is a discussion that has to be within the context of the U.N. Security Council and the key stakeholders to all of this,"" Mood told CNN. Syrian state media reported the observers' visits Saturday to several towns and cities and blamed al Qaeda-linked groups for the deaths in Houla. State TV broadcast Houla images filmed by opposition activists and reported that ""more than 50 children were killed ... by criminals and killers who aim to hurt Syria."" The government has consistently blamed ""armed terrorists"" for violence in Syria. Rebels leaders interpreted the latest massacre as evidence that a United Nations cease-fire and peace plan aren't working and called for retaliatory attacks. ""We call on our fighters, the soldiers and the revolutionaries, to conduct organized and planned military strikes against Assad battalions and regime members,"" Brig. Gen. Mustafa Al-Sheikh, a top leader in the rebel group, said in a video statement posted on YouTube. A network of Syrian opposition activists, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, blamed ""forces and armed militias"" of the Syrian government for ""a new massacre"" in Houla. ""This barbaric act was preceded by the regime's mortar shelling in the town,"" the LCC said in a statement. ""The campaign ended when the armed militias slaughtered entire families in cold blood."" Graphic video posted on YouTube purportedly shows the lifeless bodies of small children killed in Houla. They are spread on the floor amid blankets, caked in blood. One child is turned to reveal a head wound. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video, nor can it confirm reports from within the country because the government strictly limits access by foreign journalists. In a joint statement with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, joint special envoy to Syria Kofi Annan said he is contacting Syrian authorities ""to convey in the clearest terms the expectations of the international community."" ""This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers and violence in all its forms,"" the joint statement said. ""Those responsible for perpetrating this crime must be held to account."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the Houla killings. ""Those who perpetrated this atrocity must be identified and held to account,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""And the United States will work with the international community to intensify our pressure on (Syrian President Bashar al-Assad) and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end."" Turkey's President on Egypt, Syria and Israel . Lt. Bassim al-Khaled, a spokesman of the rebel Free Syrian Movement, said more bloodshed is forthcoming. The al-Assad government is using the cease-fire and peace plan ""to kill more people and is trying to crush the uprising,"" al-Khaled said. ""So the only language this regime is going to understand is the language of the gun. Wait and see, we will make them pay for each drop of blood which was shed,"" al-Khaled said. Britain also condemned the massacre, calling Saturday for an urgent session of the U.N. Security Council and a full account of the ""appalling crime."" More regime attacks Saturday killed 60 people across the country, including 25 in Homs, just south of Houla, according to the Local Coordination Committees. The Local Coordination Committees earlier Saturday decried the world's ""apparent blindness"" to the violence in Syria. Months of U.N. Security Council attempts to resolve the crisis have failed to have any effect. Ban said Friday the full cadre of 300 U.N. observers authorized by the Council will be in Syria in the coming days. Ban issued a sobering report Friday on the Syrian crisis, detailing ""continuing reports of a stepped-up security crackdown by the authorities that has led to massive violations of humans rights ... including arbitrary arrests, torture, enforced disappearance and summary execution of activists, opponents and defectors."" In a letter to the head of the U.N. Security Council, obtained by CNN, Ban said he is deeply concerned that the Syrian violence has not stopped despite the presence of the monitors and the agreement by both sides to a peace plan. U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people, mostly civilians, have died and tens of thousands have been uprooted since the uprising began in March 2011. Opposition groups report a death toll of more than 11,000 people. Since al-Assad's government and opposition forces accepted Annan's peace plan in March, at least 1,635 people have been killed, the LCC said Saturday. Following the reported massacre in Houla on Friday, the rebel Free Syrian Army implored members of the international ""Friends of Syria"" group to form a military coalition to launch airstrikes against al-Assad forces. Meanwhile, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said that ""al-Qaeda-linked terrorist groups"" massacred a couple and their six sons and a father and son in the rural village of al-Shumariyeh village in the Homs province. The agency also said similar terrorist groups massacred a family of seven, including three children, in the same province's rural town of Taldo. The groups also burned houses and crops and blamed the army for bombarding the area, SANA reported. The terror group also sabotaged the National Hospital in the area and attacked a law enforcement headquarters, SANA said.","Leader of the Free Syrian Army calls for retaliatory attacks against the government .

"Washington (CNN) -- CIA Director John Brennan on Thursday defended harsh interrogation techniques as providing ""useful"" information to authorities, including in the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. But he said it is ""unknowable"" what information could specifically be attributed to those techniques. ""It is our considered view that the detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques provided information that was useful and was used in the ultimate operation to go against Bin Laden,"" Brennan said. Brennan's comments, in a rare news conference, come two days after a Senate panel released a blockbuster 528-page report detailing ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" -- including mock executions, ""rectal rehydration,"" sleep deprivation and beatings -- in interrogations in the mid-2000s. He admitted that some CIA officers' actions were ""not authorized, were abhorrent and rightly should be repudiated by all. And we fell short in holding some officers accountable for their mistakes."" Brennan acknowledged that the agency sometimes exceeded its legal authority during interrogations of terrorism suspects. RELATED: CIA feared for future of interrogation program, report shows . He said detainees who faced ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" did provide some information that provided useful -- as well as other information that didn't. He said whether those interrogations had anything to do with that information is ""unknowable."" ""Let me be clear: We have not concluded that it was the EITs within that program that allowed us to obtain useful information from the detainees subjected to them,"" he said. But he staunchly defended the agency during the 45-minute news conference, adding: ""CIA officers' actions that did comport with the law and policy should neither be criticized nor conflated with the actions of the few who did not follow the guidance issued."" Brennan opened his remarks with a vivid depiction of the events of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and described the atmosphere going into fighting terrorism and collecting intelligence in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. ""There were no easy answers, and whatever your views are on [enhanced interrogation techniques], our nation and in particular this agency did a lot of things right during this difficult time to keep this country strong and secured,"" Brennan said. RELATED: Who is John Brennan? Brennan praised those who worked with him but he added the agency was ""unprepared to conduct a detention and interrogation program, and our officers inadequately developed and monitored its initial activities."" Brennan never used the word ""torture"" to describe the CIA's tactics. And he deflected a question about whether, in the interest of transparency, he supported the Senate Intelligence Committee's decision to release its report. ""I think there's been more than enough transparency that's happened over the last couple days,"" he said. ""I think it's over the top."" Brennan said it's ""lamentable"" that the Senate panel didn't conduct interviews with CIA agents -- a contrast, he said, with its handling of a report on Iraq's lack of weapons of mass destruction, which included interviews with more than 200 officers. His strongest criticism of the report was with its contention that the CIA misled the public and government officials -- including then-President George W. Bush. That, Brennan said, is untrue -- a stance former Vice President Dick Cheney backed up in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday night. Still, he didn't fault the report's finding that the CIA's tactics were harsh and, at times, went beyond the legal authority Bush's Justice Department said the agency had. ""Many aspects of their conclusions are sound and consistent with our own prior findings,"" Brennan said. ""Over the years, internal agency reviews, including numerous investigations by our office of the inspector general, found fault in the CIA's running of the program. We have acknowledged these mistakes."" Brennan was the CIA's deputy executive director while the tactics were being used. He said he had ""some visibility"" into what was happening, but that he wasn't in the chain of command for that program, and didn't say whether he had made any effort to push for changes at the time. He also noted that the program for using ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" was ended in 2007. ""In light of the fact that these techniques were banned seven years ago, however, my fervent hope is that we can put aside this debate and move on to issues that are relevant to our current national security challenges,"" Brennan said. Meanwhile, one of Brennan's sharpest critics, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the committee behind the report, live-tweeted along with the press conference and sharply rebutted several points throughout his press conference.

"Could the Netflix model work for a movie theater chain? AMC Theaters is reportedly exploring that with a pilot partnership with MoviePass, a company which offers a subscription service where movie lovers can attend a movie a day for a monthly fee. AMC operates more than 4,900 screens across the United States, making it the second largest theater chain behind Regal Entertainment. The New York Times reports that moviegoers would pay a fee of $35 a month, which would allow them a pass to attend one showing a day of any movie they choose. A $45 per month option includes 3D and IMAX films. MoviePass launched back in 2011 and AMC decided to partner with the company in response to the decline in attendance by young moviegoers. According to Nielsen's 2014 Moviegoing Report, which was released last week, audiences between the ages of 12 and 24 years old saw an average of 7.1 movies -- a decrease of 15.5% from last year's report. ""Millennials are consuming things differently, and that includes going to the movies,""  MoviePass's chief executive and co-founder Stacy Spikes told the Times. Younger people are already enthusiastic users of subscription services like Netflix for movies and Spotify for music, which allows them to consume what they want, when they want. ""It frankly wouldn't be smart to ignore the success of subscription in other areas of media,"" Christina Sternberg, the senior vice president for corporate strategy at AMC, told The Times. A movie a day might keep the lagging box office numbers away. The industry had a less than stellar summer blockbuster season. The new pilot program will be rolled out in January in Denver and Boston. Other cities will be added based on the rate of success in the initial markets.","AMC is launching a pilot program .

"(CNN) -- From North Korean hackers to embarrassing emails about our favorite stars, the recent hack of Sony Pictures seems to have all the makings of a Hollywood movie. And maybe one day it will be. After all, there seems to be a new plot twist almost daily, the latest coming Wednesday with news that movie theaters across the country were canceling plans to screen ""The Interview"" after a group calling itself the Guardians of Peace warned that moviegoers would suffer a ""bitter fate"" if they went to see the film. But as surreal as the Sony story sounds, it actually holds a number of valuable lessons on cybersecurity for all of us. Five stand out. 1) Different types of cybercrime have different goals. The hack of Sony has often been lumped in with stories ranging from run of the mill online credit card theft to the Target, Home Depot and JP Morgan breaches to the time that Iranian-linked hackers allegedly ""erased data on three-quarters of Aramco's corporate PCs."" In fact, most of these crimes have little more in common than the fact that they were committed using computers. It's a lot like lumping together every incident in New York that involves a gun, whether it's a bank robbery, a murder or a football player accidentally shooting himself. What made the Sony hack distinct is that it mixed an evidently organized effort, using advanced tools (what is known as an ""advanced persistent threat"") that some have linked to the North Korean state, but with the goal of maximizing attention and embarrassment for the target. That is, they weren't a few hackers phishing after any target, nor were they trying to keep quiet, so that they could continue to secretly exfiltrate data. Rather, they appear to have wanted to cause havoc -- and make sure everyone knew. Differentiating between these kinds of threats is critical, because different risks require different types of responses. The claims some have made that the Sony hack is an act of ""cyberterrorism"" are a case in point. The FBI definition of cyberterrorism requires ""an act that results in violence,"" which stealing scripts about James Bond carrying out acts of violence wouldn't meet. This also applies to the recent threats by the hackers to create 9/11 style events at any movie theater that shows the film. Rapidly becoming an illustration on how not to handle online threats, virtually all the major U.S. theater companies have now said they won't show the movie. Yet the ability to steal gossipy celebrity emails is clearly not the same as having the capacity to undertake physical attacks at thousands of movie theaters across the country. So, at least based on their actions so far, the ""bitter fate"" the hackers promised moviegoers is most likely to be the price they pay for popcorn. 2) There is no such thing as 100% security. There is no perfect security system, and even those organizations that take information security extremely seriously may find that attackers have been successful. And while the Target and JP Morgan breaches differed greatly, what they shared is that both their IT teams were well respected by the cybersecurity industry, and yet they still got hit. Companies should therefore expect that the bad guys will get in, and, indeed, should plan for it. As Wired reporter Kim Zetter put it, ""Security isn't just about detecting malware -- it's about preventing it from succeeding in stealing data once on your system."" Large organizations have to understand their new responsibilities that come with storing large amounts of sensitive information. Whether it's your scripts or employee Social Security numbers, protect it on the inside, not just the outside. 3) Your email privacy will not be respected, so act like it. One of the stranger aspects of the Sony breach is how executives acted like their communications were taking place behind an inviolable wall. The sad reality is that as more of our data inevitably finds its way into the public eye, we'll have to assume that private emails may not always remain private. So the rule your parents told you that you should never write something you wouldn't be OK with seeing in a newspaper holds all the more true now, even as newspapers disappear. And if you won't listen to your parents, then at least listen to what Oprah recently told CNN on this. Frankly, this was common sense over a decade ago; Enron's analysts, for example, got caught joking about cheating ""Grandma Millie."" While it would be great if media outlets (and the government, for that matter) respected our email privacy, the fact is that they'll choose to disclose based on their own protocols. Indeed, it has been telling that while many of the media outlets called for respecting celebrity privacy when it came to leaked nude photos of celebrities, they have been happy to report on the Hollywood gossip revealed by this hack. 4) The cost of a cybersecurity breach isn't just about the technical cleanup. When businesses think about the costs of a cybersecurity incident, they usually only contemplate the hard numbers on the technical side, roughly the cost of the technical and legal investigation and cleanup added to the business lost from being knocked offline. With this in mind, some have estimated this particular breach may cost Sony as much as $100 million. The reality, as the studio is now experiencing, is that the costs often go well beyond. The hit for the firm encompasses everything from future business opportunities missed to lost customer trust to a certainly unwanted new role in the debate over gender pay disparity. This means that while most of us won't have to face a lifetime of icy stares from Angelina Jolie, we do need to think of cybercosts in a different, broader way. Indeed, a survey by PWC of business executives found that only 39% of them weighed the impact of a cyberattack on their brand image and only 25% on lost secrets and other intellectual property. This gap is important, because how you weigh the potential costs shapes what you are willing to do to prevent them. 5) Attribution is hard, and sometimes doesn't matter. Victims understandably want to know who hit them, but knowing with certainty who is responsible for an attack is incredibly difficult. In the Sony case, most signs point to North Korean linked hackers; the government of North Korea had expressed deep anger over ""The Interview,"" and there are similarities to other attacks traced back to North Korea in certain reported attack techniques. But these are mostly context-based, good enough so far only for the court of public opinion. But even if we felt a high degree of confidence, it's unclear what Sony could or should do next. North Korea's government would likely still deny its direct involvement even in the case of damning evidence. And even if it admitted its role, Sony's actual recourse appears to be limited. This means that whether one is looking at the Sony breach, the Iranian hack of the Sands Casino or the massive Chinese campaign of theft of corporate secrets, the real problem isn't one of attribution, but accountability.","Peter Singer and Allan Friedman: Sony hack has lessons for us all .
It's important not to treat all cybercrime the same, authors say .

"(CNN)Musical maestro Vanessa Mae wants her ban from international skiing competitions lifted. The multi-million selling violin star -- who competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics under the name Vanessa Vanakorn -- has lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Mae was given a four-year ban by the International Ski Federation (FIS) in November after the results of her final Olympic qualifying event were adjudged to have been manipulated. ""The FIS panel found Ms Vanakorn was either an active or knowing participant in the manipulation of the results of four giant slalom races that took place in Krvavec, Slovenia in January 2014,"" explained a statement issued by CAS Thursday. ""The FIS council subsequently canceled the results of the four races in question. As a consequence of this decision, Ms Vanakorn was no longer eligible to compete in the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games. ""In appealing to the CAS, Ms Vanakorn seeks the annulment of both decisions. Two arbitration procedures have been opened."" The giant slalom events in question were organized by the Thai Olympic Committee at the request of Mae's management. They were the last chance for the violinist to fulfill her dream of representing her father's homeland, Thailand, at the 2014 Winter Olympics, held in Russia. The 36-year-old, who was born in Singapore but grew up in Britain, went on to make her Games bow on the Sochi slopes. Her appearance in the giant slalom made history as she became Thailand's first ever female skier. The fact that she finished 67th and dead last did not dampen her enthusiasm. ""I expected to be last but at the end of the day the Olympics is a great opportunity,"" she told reporters. ""I nearly crashed three times, but I made it down and that was the main thing."" Last-minute decision . She also revealed that her decision to make the transition from musician to Olympian had been made at short notice. ""I'm a last-minute kind of girl, I mean training for the Olympics with six months to go was a last-minute thing,"" she added. But it was that last-minute rush to qualify for the Sochi Games that appears to have landed Mae in trouble with the skiing authorities. She has described her ban by the FIS as ""nonsensical."" Mae's musical prowess made her a household name in Britain and much of the rest of the world, with global sales in excess of 10 million. She made her solo debut with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London at the age of 10, three years later becoming the youngest soloist ever to record the Beethoven and Tchaikovsky violin concertos.","Vanessa Mae is appealing her four year ban from international skiing competitions .

"(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors charged two men with plotting a ""killing spree"" against African-Americans that would have been capped with an attempt to kill Sen. Barack Obama while they wore white tuxedos, federal officials said Monday. Paul Schlesselman, left,  and Daniel Cowart said they planned to kill more than 100 African-Americans. The U.S. attorney's office in Jackson, Tennessee, said Daniel Cowart, 20, and Paul Schlesselman, 18, were self-described white supremacists who met online through a mutual friend. Both men have been charged with illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to rob a federally licensed gun dealer and making threats against a presidential candidate. The men planned to kill more than 100 African-Americans, including 14 who would be beheaded, according to the affidavit. But federal law enforcement sources said there was no evidence Cowart, of Bells, Tennessee, and Schlesselman, of West Helena, Arkansas, had any details of Obama's schedule. ""We take this very, very seriously but we see no evidence these guys have the ability or the wherewithal to pull off what they say they wanted to do,"" one law enforcement source said. According to an affidavit from the federal agent who questioned them, Cowart and Schlesselman planned to charge at Obama with a car, firing from the windows as they went. They would be dressed in white tuxedos and top hats during the attempt, the affidavit states. Cowart and Schlesselman were arrested outside Jackson, about 75 miles east of Memphis, Tennessee, after an aborted robbery attempt last week, according to court records. Though they told investigators they would be willing to die in their mission, the men backed out of their October 21 attempt to rob the gun dealer after spotting two cars and a dog at the home, the affidavit states. The men also shot out the window of a church on their way back to Cowart's grandfather's home, where they were arrested the next day. Cowart and Schlesselman made their initial appearances before a federal judge Monday and are scheduled for a bond hearing Thursday in Memphis. Obama, an Illinois Democrat, is the first African-American nominee to lead a major-party ticket and was placed under Secret Service protection in May 2007, far earlier than other candidates. Eric Zahren, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said it was unclear whether the suspects would have had the capability or means to carry out any sort of plot. But he said the matter was being taken seriously, and a joint investigation was under way. There was no indication either had attended any Obama event or had drawn Secret Service attention in the past, Zahren said. Campaign spokeswoman Linda Douglass said, ""We never comment on security matters."" Threats against Obama have led to arrests in two previous cases. In one, federal prosecutors concluded that the three people arrested with drugs and weapons in a suburban Denver motel posed a ""true threat"" to the candidate. In the second, a Florida man was charged with threatening bodily harm against the candidate in August. He has pleaded not guilty. CNN Chief National Correspondent John King contributed to this report.","Plot included killing 100 African-Americans, beheading 14, officials say .

"The FBI planned to fly Edward Snowden's father to Moscow to encourage the National Security Agency leaker to come home to the United States, his father told The Washington Post. But Lon Snowden said he backed out, because it was not clear he would be able to speak to his son. Interactive: Snowden's options . ""I said, 'I want to be able to speak with my son. . . . Can you set up communications?' And it was, 'Well, we're not sure,' "" the father told the newspaper Tuesday. ""I said, 'Wait a minute, folks, I'm not going to sit on the tarmac to be an emotional tool for you.'"" Lon Snowden spoke to CNN on Monday and Tuesday, but did not bring up this incident. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper Tuesday, the father said he wants the accused leaker to stay in Russia, until he is confident he can get a fair trial in the United States. Snowden's father: 'I know my son. I know he loves his country . ""I am not confident at all,"" Lon Snowden said. The multiple guilty verdicts handed to leaker Pfc.

""I think my son has exercised discretion in the information that he has shared,"" he said. Edward Snowden admires Manning, his father said. ""He's an individual who took a stand."" Snowden a patriot? Edward Snowden, a former employee of a government contractor, leaked to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. It also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, Snowden said. Lawmakers in Washington have built a criminal case against him. Snowden's lawyer, Bruce Fein, who also appeared in the interview with Tapper, objected to the government's intent to prosecute Snowden. ""The majority of the American people now have voiced grave concerns about the scope of that program. And it seems somewhat odd to be prosecuting somebody for disclosing government wrongdoing."" Snowden -- facts, fictions and fears . He said that Snowden had the courage to spark a conversation that President Barack Obama has called ""urgent."" Fein believes it would be impossible to find an ""unpoisoned jury"" to try his client given the heavy media coverage. He lambasted Washington politicians for speaking of Snowden as if he were guilty, trampling on his right to be considered not guilty until proven otherwise. Lon Snowden told the Post that his son grew up in a patriotic family. Many of his relatives had served in the military or police forces.  Lon Snowden said he served in the U.S. Coast Guard. His son acted out of patriotism, he said, knowing that he would suffer personally for his decision to protect Americans' constitutional rights to privacy. Lon Snowden told Tapper that he expects Obama to do the same.","Edward Snowden acted out of patriotism, his father tells The Washington Post .

"Thousands of residents in the capital of the Gorno-Badakshan region in eastern Tajikistan were trapped Thursday for a third consecutive day without any connection to the outside world, government officials, aid workers and witnesses told CNN. Lola Kassamali, a Tajik who now lives in Seattle, Washington, said she had not been able to reach relatives in Khorog for three days. ""I don't know what to do,"" she said. The cutoff of communications began Tuesday, when fighting erupted in the autonomous region -- also known as Pamir -- after central government forces attempted to arrest a former opposition warlord believed to have been behind the killing of a top security general. Read more: Deadly clashes erupt in Tajikistan . Residents of Khorog, the capital of the province of Gorno-Badakhshan, awakened Tuesday to helicopters carrying government forces and flying low over the city near the compound of the former warlord, Tolib Ayombekov, witnesses said. Communication lines, including cell phones and Internet service, were severed. Aid workers, some of whom had satellite telephones, were evacuated. The government accuses Ayombekov's fighters in last weekend's killing of Maj. Gen. Abdullo Nazarov, head of the regional branch of the State Committee on National Security, which is a successor to the Soviet KGB. A group of unidentified people stopped Nazarov's car near Khorog, according to Ria-Novosti, a Russian state-run news service. He was pulled from the car, stabbed several times and died en route to a hospital, according to Ria-Novosti. A spokesman for the government in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe said the killing was ""the last straw."" He said the warlords were troublemakers. In his last public appearance before he went into hiding early this week, Ayombekov told reporters that Nazarov's security detail had failed to protect him. It was not clear what he meant by that. Apparently, Ayombekov's forces were prepared for Tuesday's arrival of government forces looking for him. Residents described continuous gunfire in the city, which borders Afghanistan. The Central Asian News Agency said Ayombekov refused to surrender to police and instigated the attack against government forces. At least 12 soldiers and 30 opposition fighters were killed in the fighting, said a statement from Tajikistan's security service on Tuesday. Police arrested two suspects but were still seeking Ayombekov, who is the suspected leader of a ring that smuggled tobacco, precious jewels and drugs, the Central Asian News Service said. Until last week, Ayombekov had been working for Nazarov overseeing border security between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, an administration official in Badakhshan told CNN. The official did not want to be identified because he is not allowed to speak to the news media. Tajikistan gained independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but has been troubled by a five-year civil war that ended in 1997 as well as widespread corruption and poverty, which continue today. Read more: Clinton discusses human rights, regional security in Tajikistan . Tensions remain high between the Tajik government in Dushanbe and the warlords -- so-called Komandos -- of Gorno-Badakshan, who are members of the Pamiri ethnic minority. The region was a stronghold of rebels during the civil war, which claimed thousands of lives. The war divided people along ethnic and regional lines, and the Pamiri largely sided with the opposition. A United Nations-brokered peace plan left President Emomali Rakhmon's secular government in place but gave some of his opponents, including Ayombekov, official jobs. Rakhmon, who has Moscow's support, has sought to consolidate power and stamp out remnants of the former opposition-turned-warlords. Khorog residents said they had received no warning of this week's fighting. The official from the Badakhshan administration said residents told him they were not siding with anyone -- they just wanted safe passage out of Pamir. Journalist Mirzojalol Shohjamolov said a group of residents gathered in front of Khorog Square, near the government building, with signs that said: ""Stop military actions in Khorog."" Protests against the military operation were also held in New York, Moscow and the Kyrgyzstan city of Bishkek. In New York, Rustam Nazrisho vowed to demonstrate daily in front of the United Nations until the government of Tajikistan restores communications and offers safe passage out of the region to residents who have been caught up in the violence.","Government forces clash with opposition fighters in Gorno-Badakshan region .

"(RollingStone.com) -- She's brassy, hilarious and just about the only comedian around who can almost single-handedly carry a movie to a $35 million opening: ""Tammy"" star Melissa McCarthy is on the cover of our Summer Double issue (on stands now), flexing her muscles for a revealing story that details her long rise to stardom and her (sometimes unusual) acting techniques. McCarthy may be known for swearing onscreen, but hanging out with contributing editor Erik Hedegaard, she offers more ""holy smokies!"" than f***s as she explains how she spent a decade kicking around comedy clubs in New York and Los Angeles, then gave herself a deadline: If she didn't catch a break by the time she turned 30, she'd consider giving up the dream. A week before her birthday, she got a call about an audition for ""Gilmore Girls,"" and 14 years later, she's become one of the most reliable comedy actors in Hollywood, stealing the spotlight in movies like ""Bridesmaids,"" ""The Heat"" and ""Identity Thief"" and chilling with Brad and Angelina at the Golden Globes. Rated XX: A brief history of female comedies . Here are five revelations from the story: . She started her career in comedy doing stand-up as a drag queen named Miss Y. When McCarthy moved to New York at age 20, her roommate, Brian Atwood, a friend from home who would go on to become a popular shoe designer, suggested she try stand-up. ""I really dressed to rival a drag queen, for sure,"" she recalls. (""It was the time of Lady Miss Kier, RuPaul and Lady Bunny,"" says Atwood.) ""I had a gold lamé swing coat on, a huge wig, big eyelashes,"" McCarthy recalls. ""I talked about being incredibly wealthy and beautiful and living extravagantly."" She got cast in ""Bridesmaids"" despite slipping into one of her ""fugue states"" during the audition — and rambling about dolphin sex. Doing improv with Kristen Wiig in front of Judd Apatow and Paul Feig, McCarthy blacked out and began rambling about inter-species dolphin sex. ""There's not one thing you could have done to seem any stranger,"" she said to herself in the car home. ""Sex with a dolphin? Handplay with a dolphin! You just could not have been any weirder."" A year or so later, she was nominated for an Oscar for her role in the film. 'Saturday Night' specials: 15 great female 'SNL' hosts . She also blacks out during many of her best curse-filled tirades. When McCarthy was a kid, she'd flatten herself against dining room chairs and scare her father by grabbing his leg when he finally walked by. These days, she brings that commitment to her acting roles, getting so deep into character that she almost loses consciousness. During the end credits of ""This Is 40,"" for instance, McCarthy tells Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, ""I would like to rear up and jackknife my legs and kick you both in the f*****g jaw with my foot bone. That's what I would f*****g love. I wish my f*****g foot would go right through your skull."" Now, she laughs, ""When I saw that scene, I really truly didn't remember saying most of it."" She was a bit of an angsty teenage goth. Early in high school, McCarthy was a preppy jock: a cheerleader and a student-council member. But when puberty hit, she dyed her hair blue-black, wore weirdo fishnets on her arms and snuck out to Chicago, where she'd frequent a club called Medusa's and dance on scaffolding. ""I turned slightly nuts,"" she admits of the years she drank wine coolers and cheap beer — and did a little shoplifting. ""We'd wrap sweaters around ourselves and walk out."" (She also owns up to stealing a Chunky when she was five.) Melissa McCarthy: The runaway bridesmaid . She's actually quite happy now. Less the tortured comic genius of cliché than a married-with-kids success story, McCarthy seems almost content. When Hedegaard asks what she might be running from, the star can't come up with an answer, offering only, ""I don't know."" Her self-destructive habits? ""I could eat healthier, I could drink less,"" she says. ""I should be learning another language and working out more, but I'm just always saying, 'Ah, I could get hit by a bus tomorrow.'""

"An Atlanta businesswoman has accused GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain of having had an affair with her that lasted nearly 14 years, a claim the candidate flatly denied Monday. ""I was aware that he was married, and I was also aware that I was involved in a very inappropriate situation -- relationship,"" Ginger White told Atlanta television station WAGA. White also confirmed to CNN affiliate WSB that she had a sexual relationship with Cain, countering Cain's claims that the relationship was just a friendship . ""Absolutely,"" White said when asked by the affiliate if the relationship was sexual.  ""I can't imagine him confirming. It's the name of the game I guess."" White told WAGA the affair ended about eight months ago, as Cain prepared to announce his presidential bid. But she pointed to mobile-phone records she said showed Cain was calling her as late as September, including one as early as 4:26 a.m. WAGA said that when it sent a text message to the number she identified as Cain's, the candidate called back and acknowledged he knew White but had been trying to help her financially. Cain, who lives in suburban Atlanta, upstaged the report by going on CNN a few minutes before the station broadcast its interview with White. He told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" that her assertion was coming and would be false. ""It is someone that I know who is an acquaintance that I thought was a friend,"" Cain said. But he added, ""I did not have an affair."" ""I acknowledge that I knew the woman,"" he said. ""I acknowledge that I have known her for about that period of time. But the accusation that I had a 13-year affair with her, no."" He said his wife's immediate reaction upon hearing of the accusation was, ""Here we go again."" And he said he had no plans to drop out of the race -- ""Not as long as my wife is behind me and as long as my wife believes I should stay in this race."" In a written statement issued after the interview aired, he said, ""I will not fight false claims as it is not what America needs or wants."" ""The American public is tired of dirty politics and smear tactics as evident of their tremendous outpouring of support for me, my family and my campaign this past month,"" he said. ""I am running for president of the United States of America, and the reality is that there are individuals out there that favor the status quo of higher taxes, more government and political cronyism and they are afraid of a Cain presidency."" White's emergence comes after two other women came forward in early November to accuse Cain of sexually harassing them while he was head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Cain has denied all accusations against him, but he has slipped in published polls since the allegations first surfaced. White said she was never harassed or poorly treated by Cain, whom she described as ""very much confident, and very much sure of himself, very arrogant -- in a playful, sometimes, way."" She said he took her to luxury hotels and flew her to cities where he had speaking engagements. ""He made it very intriguing,"" White said in the interview. ""It was fun. It was something that took me away from my sort-of humdrum life at the time, and it was exciting."" In a statement to WAGA, Cain attorney Lin Wood said reporters had no business asking about the allegation. ""This is not an accusation of harassment in the workplace -- this is not an accusation of an assault -- which are subject matters of legitimate inquiry to a political candidate,"" he said. ""Rather, this appears to be an accusation of private, alleged consensual conduct between adults -- a subject matter which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public. ""No individual, whether a private citizen, a candidate for public office or a public official, should be questioned about his or her private sexual life,"" Wood said. ""The public's right to know and the media's right to report has boundaries and most certainly those boundaries end outside of one's bedroom door."" He did not address White's assertion directly, and said Cain ""has no obligation to discuss these types of accusations publicly with the media. ""Some things are fair game, and some aren't,"" Wood told CNN in a telephone interview, adding that this was one that was off-limits. ""You've got to draw the line somewhere."" White told WAGA that she was a reluctant accuser who decided to go public only after her name was circulated among reporters. But she also said she was upset by Cain's responses to the sexual harassment allegations from two women who have been identified publicly. ""It bothered me that they were being demonized, sort of, or were being treated as if they were automatically lying and the burden of proof is on them,"" White said. WAGA said it and other news organizations had received a tip from someone who knew White, alleging she had had an affair with Cain. ""I wanted to come out and give my side before it was thrown out there and made to be something, you know, filthy, which some people will look at this and say, that's exactly what it is,"" White told the station. She said their on-again, off-again relationship allegedly began in Louisville, Kentucky, in the late 1990s, when Cain gave a National Restaurant Association presentation to a group that included White. Afterward, the two shared drinks and Cain invited her back to his hotel room, where he pulled out a calendar and invited her to meet him in Palm Springs, California, she said. WAGA said White's work history includes a 2001 sexual harassment claim against an employer that was settled, a 23-year-old bankruptcy in Kentucky and several evictions over the past six years. A former business partner accused her of stalking her with repeated e-mails and texts in a case that was ultimately dismissed, followed by a libel suit White lost because she failed to respond to it, WAGA said. But White's attorney, Edward Buckley, told CNN's ""John King USA"" that his client has no apparent financial motive for making the accusation and ""everything to lose."" ""To tell you candidly, I don't know if she is employed or not, because she was kind of on the ropes because of all this stuff,"" Buckley said. ""The media called her employer before this story came out, and it made it very difficult for her in the workplace."" And prominent feminist attorney Gloria Allred, who represents one of the women who accused Cain of harassing them, said White's financial troubles mean ""zero, zip, nada."" ""There are millions of women in this country and millions of men as well having financial problems,"" she told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""The fact that she's had them in the past does not bear on whether or not she's credible on this issue.""","Accuser says the relationship was sexual, TV station reports .

"The Sydney siege has brought home some troubling truths to Australians. They are not immune to the upheavals in the Middle East, despite being on the other side of the world. They are as vulnerable as Canadians or Europeans to what are often called ""lone-wolf"" terror attacks. And recently-introduced anti-terror laws, while some of the toughest in the world, can only do so much. Radicalized Australians have been drawn to ISIS for many months, as well as to al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra. Intelligence estimates put the number of Australians fighting with militant groups in the region at between 60 and 100. And long before Syria and Iraq became the jihadists' destinations of choice, Australians were among foreign militants converging on Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. Besides those who leave Australia, there has been growing concern about networks which facilitate travel and raise money, raising the risk of attacks on the homeland. The Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) estimates that around 100 people support jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, providing money or assisting with travel, for example. In July, when he was Director-General of ASIO, David Irvine told Australia's National Press Club: ""We have been long, in my time, monitoring a small number of Muslim Australians who support violent extremism and who frequently express the aspiration of conducting terrorist attacks in Australia."" High alert . The Australian government raised the national terrorism alert to ""high"" in September, and an estimated 800 police officers were involved in a series of raids on addresses in the Sydney area.  During those raids, a 22 year old named Omarjan Azari was arrested and later charged with plotting to behead members of the public. His lawyer has asserted Azari's innocence. Azari has since been charged with helping to fund travel for would-be jihadists to Syria and Iraq, along with another man arrested Monday. GALLERY: How Sydney siege unfolded . Prosecutors allege that Azari had spoken by phone with a prominent figure in ISIS -- Mohammed Ali Baryalei. Baryalei's family emigrated to Australia from Afghanistan in the early 1980s.  As a young man, Baryalei was a nightclub doorman in Sydney's red-light district and no stranger to drugs and alcohol. But then in 2009 came an epiphany: He rediscovered his religion. Whether he was influenced by others or self-radicalized is unclear, but his path to militancy was rapid and dramatic. Baryalei left Australia, and after spending some time with Jabhat al-Nusra, he joined ISIS and tried to get associates back home to carry out attacks, according to the federal police. Unconfirmed reports suggest he may have been killed in October, though senior Australian officials say they have no confirmation that he is dead. Another prominent Australian in jihadist groups is Abu Sulayman, who used to be a preacher in Sydney. Now he is a senior figure within al Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra. ISIS has encouraged followers and sympathizers to carry out attacks in their homelands. In September, the public face of the group -- Abu Mohammed al Adnani -- urged followers to kill ""in any manner"" citizens of countries who were part of the coalition against ISIS, including a ""disbelieving American or European -- especially the spiteful and filthy French -- or an Australian, or a Canadian ..."" Solo attacks . Both ISIS and al Qaeda have urged followers in the West to carry out low-tech, solo attacks involving hostage-taking and the use of guns, as large-scale operations have become increasingly difficult to organize and execute. Al Qaeda in particular has repeatedly called on sympathizers to carry out ""do-it-yourself"" attacks. (The Boston marathon bombers used a ""recipe"" from an online al Qaeda publication to build their devices.) Besides the case against Azari, there have been other indications that the Australian homeland is not immune to acts of terror. In September, 18-year-old Numan Haider was shot dead by police after he repeatedly stabbed two police officers. His passport had recently been confiscated because of his alleged intention to travel to Syria or Iraq. Some of the Australians who made the journey to Iraq and Syria have been killed. At least one became a suicide bomber. ISIS said in June that ""Abu Bakr al-Australi"" had carried out a suicide bombing in Baghdad, killing himself and five others. He was later identified as an 18-year-old from Melbourne. Among those reputedly recruited by Baryalei were a young couple from Brisbane, Amira Karroum and Tyler Casey, who were later killed in Aleppo in the midst of a battle between rival jihadist groups. Her family described Karroum as a normal teenager who had gone to nightclubs and studied graphic design. She had then fallen under the sway of the Street Dawah movement -- a radical Muslim preaching group in Sydney -- and a cousin involved in Street Dawah had arranged her marriage to Tyler Casey, who by then had already spent time in Yemen. The cousin later financed her travel -- via Denmark -- to the Middle East. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Karroum's father Mohammed said his daughter ""came and saw me before she left. I didn't know she was leaving, and she hugged me and she started to cry."" The jihadist pipeline from Australia to the region has gradually become more sophisticated, according to Andrew Zammit, who follows jihadist activity among Australians. ""Many of the Australian fighters prior to November 2013 appeared to be entering Syria with few pre-existing connections to armed groups, but since then two alleged recruitment networks have been uncovered,"" Zammit wrote in September's Sentinel, published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. In June this year, a 17-year-old Australian of Lebanese origin named Abdullah Elmir vanished from his family's home in a quiet suburb of Sydney. He told his mother he was going on a fishing trip.  Four months later, he fronted an ISIS video, in which he threatened Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Dressed in military-style fatigues and holding a rifle, Elmir said: ""We will not put down our weapons until we reach your lands, until we take the head of every tyrant and until the black flag is flying high in every single land."" Anti-ISIS coalition . Australia has contributed military support to the anti-ISIS coalition, and the government has been well aware of the threat of retaliation. It has massively beefed up funding for security and intelligence and enacted tough new anti-terrorism laws that include greater surveillance and search powers, as well as ""control orders"" that allow detention without charge in some terrorism-related cases. It is also now a criminal offense for Australians to travel to the province of Raqqa in Syria, the heartland of ISIS. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says the passports of 75 Australians have been canceled this year. But for the intelligence services, detecting plans by would-be ""lone wolf"" attackers remains an immense challenge. The United Kingdom, Belgium and Canada have all seen such attacks. In the Canadian case, the attacker had also been denied a passport. As David Irvine, then head of ASIO, put it in July: ""A recurring nightmare -- for me, anyway -- has been the so-called lone wolf, often radicalized over the internet and who has managed to avoid coming across our radar."" In the past two years, he said the situation in Syria and Iraq had radically complicated the threat, ""adding energy and allure to the extremist Islamic narrative,"" especially with the declaration of a Caliphate. Australia now appears to have joined the long list of countries that have seen that threat translated into reality.","Australia is not immune to the upheavals in the Middle East, writes CNN's Tim Lister .

"He horsey danced his way to the top of the UK music chart -- and U.S. domination may not be far behind. Psy's viral ""Gangnam Style"" hit the top spot Sunday, marking the first time that a Korean singer has climbed the British singles chart. In the United States, Psy remains at number 2, behind Maroon 5 in the Billboard 100 as of Monday morning. Billboard has a Psy Watch on its website, on whether he'll reach the top spot. And this weekend, the Filipino inmates of the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center, famous for their performance of Michael Jackson's""Thriller,"" gyrated and air lassoed their version of ""Gangnam Style."" The catchy tune that launched what seems like a thousand parodies, has likely replaced Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe"" as the most lip synched song this year. Psy: My video's more popular than me! Last week, ""Gangnam Style"" snatched the Guinness World Record for the ""most liked"" YouTube video ever. It has over 335 million views and dominates the iTunes store in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and several European countries. Tributes continue to flood YouTube with performances by the Ohio University's marching band, a Swedish flash mob and a Korean-American mother primly dancing alongside her son in what's called ""Mom Gangnam Style."" And yes, even a parody from the North Korean government. Whether you're sick of ""Gangnam Style"" or can't get enough of it, Psy seems ubiquitous -- popping up on ""Saturday Night Live"" and MTV's Video Music Awards, and signing with Justin Bieber's manager. Psy's song -- about the wannabe style of the affluent neighborhood of Gangnam in Seoul -- has been sliced and diced with theories about what it means about wealth and class in Korea, and questions about whether Psy embodies the stereotypes about Asian masculinity. Psy is a slight departure from the usual Korean pop stars, who are typically svelte, impeccably dressed and very serious about their dance moves. Instead, it's Psy, a portly man who likes to mimic Lady Gaga and Beyonce performances while wearing sparkly leotards, who broke into the Western pop psyche. ""I think foreigners think I'm funny, the way Korean people think Austin Powers and Mr. Bean are funny,"" he told CNN.","""Gangnam Style"" hits top spot in UK singles chart, first for a Korean singer .

"The newly-renovated Castelao football stadium looms into sight up ahead. Driving just past it, we see women standing on street corners, leaning into cars and flashing nearly naked bodies in the low light. We're in Fortaleza in the northeastern corner of Brazil, one of the World Cup host cities but also known as a magnet for sex tourism. Prostitution is legal in Brazil for those 18 or older, but government and soccer officials are trying stto crack down on the child sex trade before the tournament kicks off in June. Antonio Carlos da Silva, a social worker with O Pequeno Nazareno, says the prostitutes around the stadium now cater to truckers but dream about big bucks from visiting fans. ""Ever since Brazil was selected to host the World Cup in 2014, it created these huge expectations,"" he says as we drive down a darkened avenue. ""The girls keep asking me ""where can I take English classes so I can get more clients?"""" We pull up to chat with Taina, an 18-year-old transsexual who has been working the streets since she was a minor. ""Sometimes people want trannies, sometimes they want girls,"" she says. Hiding down side streets . She says that child prostitutes hide down side streets or behind bus stops. According to critics, officials have pushed the child sex trade out of sight, but haven't done enough to eradicate its root causes. They warn underage prostitution could explode during the World Cup. ""These girls come from extreme poverty, a culture of social exclusion and a tradition of profound disrespect for women,"" says Antonia Lima Sousa, a state prosecutor. She says the desperation is so great, some parents even put their own children on the street. But there is also a serious problem with organized crime. ""It involves a whole tourism network, from agencies to hotels to taxis,"" she says. ""With these mega events, sexual exploitation is also going to be organized much more via the Internet."" Despite promises to eradicate child prostitution, the number of estimated child sex workers in Brazil stood at about half a million in 2012, according to the non-profit National Forum for the Prevention of Child Labor. Fortaleza is considered a hotspot for child sex tourism, due in part to the widespread poverty as well as a now long-standing reputation that means potential clients continue to seek out the beach resort over other Brazilian destinations, often chartering planes direct from Europe, according to prosecutors. It will also host six World Cup games including teams and fans from Germany, Greece, Mexico and the Ivory Coast. A total of 600,000 foreign visitors are expected in Brazil and another three million Brazilian fans are expected to travel around the country. New ad campaign . The Brazilian government set aside 8 million reais, or about $3.3 million, to combat the child sex trade in host cities. Footballers have also taken a stand in a new ad campaign ahead of the 2014 World Cup, featuring Brazil's David Luiz and England's Gary Lineker, among others. ""Sadly, some people will use this opportunity to sexually exploit children,"" Lineker says in the video. ""Paying for sex with anyone 17 or under is absolutely illegal."" In Fortaleza, there has been a police crackdown on child prostitution and the city government says it has implemented new programs, but officials refused to be interviewed by CNN. We were welcomed by a handful of non-profit groups helping get children and adolescents off the street. O Pequeno Nazareno works directly with street children, including young boys who have been forced into the sex trade, offering food and shelter and even organizing a football team. The Catholic group Sisters of Remption takes in pregnant teens who have been sexually exploited. There we meet Bruna, who was 12 when she ended up on the street, addicted to crack cocaine. She says she tried not to get involved in prostitution. ""There was a time when I had to, it was my last resort,"" she says. ""I went to a motel with this guy who was 47 and got my 20 reais."" That's about $9. Bruna is now 15 and eight months pregnant. She is living in a small, but neat room in the sisters' house, with her own bed, a crib and a private bathroom. Sister Maria says that last June during the Confederations Cup, a kind of dry run for the World Cup, underage prostitutes and street children were swept up by police and taken to a shelter outside of town. But after the tournament was over, they were turned loose. Police refused to speak with CNN for this report. ""They aren't worried about these children growing up in a healthy environment, with jobs and housing, health and education,"" she says. ""They're worried about hiding them."" Job training for victims . Nearby, the non-profit Vira Vida provides basic schooling and job training for young victims of sexual exploitation. Many turn into cooks, hairdressers and computer technicians. Jucileide, now 21, completed the training and has an internship at a bank. ""I was a call girl,"" she tells us. ""I was 13 when I started."" At first she didn't tell her unemployed mother. ""When she discovered, I was 15. She cried and asked me to stop, but I said ""mom, it's easy money."""" The next day, Jucileide takes us to the beach bars where she used to pick up foreign tourists. ""The ones that have more call girls are those two,"" she says pointing to plastic yellow tables and chairs that line the sidewalk, full of a mix of locals and tourists. At night, they fill with older foreign men, mostly from Europe. Young women in skimpy clothing hover nearby, exchanging phone numbers or walking off arm-in-arm with the older men. Experts say that after hotels started barring girls under 18, clients began to rent apartments or head to so-called love motels. The late-night scene down the road is much more brazen. Prostitutes hang out on corners and even congregate in front of the police station, shaking their backsides at cars as they drive by. Fake IDs . Many look like they are barely in their teens, but experts say they use fake IDs. Down a side alley, we find two girls who say they're 16 and 17 but look much younger. They don't smile and talk barely above a whisper. ""I've been doing this for two months,"" says one girl. The other one says: ""We use the money to buy things we need, clothes, school supplies."" They say they don't have pimps or protectors and when clients refuse to pay, they have to walk hours to get home. On every corner, another sad story. Some girls even tell us they stayed on the streets through teenage pregnancies, including Jucileide. She turned her life around with the help of Vira Vida, but says where she comes from, the sex trade is easy money.","Just past a World Cup stadium is a notorious red light district .

"President Barack Obama on Friday announced that virtually all U.S. troops will come home from Iraq by the end of the year -- at which point he can declare an end to America's long and costly war in that Middle Eastern nation. ""After nearly nine years, America's war in Iraq will be over,"" Obama said. ""The coming months will be a season of homecomings. Our troops in Iraq will definitely be home for the holidays."" Of the 39,000 troops in Iraq, about 150, a negligible force, will remain to assist in arms sales, a U.S. official told CNN. The rest will be out of Iraq by December 31. The president said he was making good on his 2008 campaign pledge to end a war that has divided the nation since it began in 2003 and claimed more than 4,400 American lives.The announcement also came after talks that might have allowed a continued major military presence broke down amid disputes about whether U.S. troops would be immune to prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Obama spoke with Iraqi President Nuri al-Maliki in a video conference Friday, after which he said both nations were comfortable with the decision on how to move forward. The new partnership with Iraq will be ""strong and enduring,"" Obama said. ""The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their head held high, proud of their success and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops,"" Obama said. According to a statement from the Iraqi prime minister's office, al-Maliki and Obama ""shared the same point of view on the need to start a new phase of strategic relations."" That includes agreeing to a high-level meeting within two weeks. Beyond the human cost, the price tag for U.S. military activity in Iraq has been steep as well. A report from the non-partisan, government-funded Congressional Research Service found that the Defense Department spent nearly $757 billion for military operations in Iraq over the past decade, $50 billion higher than the estimate released by the Pentagon.  Another $41 billion for Iraq was spent on State Department and USAID initiatives, plus $6 billion for troops' health expenses, the CRS report stated. Paul Rieckhoff -- an ex-Army soldier who heads the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the first and largest such organization for these veterans, according to its website -- cheered Friday's announcement as ""really good news for the troops serving overseas."" ""It's a really poignant time, especially for the veterans community,"" Rieckhoff told CNN. ""Many of us gave large parts of our lives, some gave all in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn."" While Democrats largely applauded Friday's announcement, some Republicans disagreed with the president. Sen. John McCain called it a ""consequential failure"" for the Obama administration, which he said wasn't focused on succeeding in Iraq, and Iraq's government. ""Today marks a harmful and sad setback for the United States in the world,"" said McCain, an Arizona Republican who faced off against Obama in the 2008 presidential election. ""This decision will be viewed as a strategic victory for our enemies in the Middle East, especially the Iranian regime, which has worked relentlessly to ensure a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq."" Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough dismissed the notion that Friday's decision would affect Iran, which he claimed already is ""weaker and more isolated"" due to U.S. and allied efforts unrelated to Iraq. ""We don't need to try to exercise our influence on those matters through Iraq,"" McDonough told reporters Friday. ""We're obviously concerned about Iran's willingness to live up to its obligations ... but we don't have concerns about our ability to make sure that the Iraqis can exercise the kind of sovereignty that they want."" Another U.S. official -- who is not authorized to speak for attribution -- acknowledged that ""the Iranians have been trying to gain influence in Iraq for some time,"" but stressed that ""Iranian influence in Iraq has limits."" The official said the Iraq ""will not roll over"" to Iran, with whom it has a long history of border disputes including a bloody eight-year war in the 1980s. The current Status of Force Agreement had called for U.S. troops to leave  by the end of 2011. But lengthy negotiations in recent months had led some to expect that American troops -- roughly 40,000 of which are in Iraq -- would remain there into next year. These talks, however, broke down over the prickly issue of legal immunity for U.S. troops in Iraq, a senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the discussions told CNN this month. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other top brass have repeatedly said any deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the withdrawal deadline would require a guarantee of legal protection for American soldiers. But the Iraqis refused to agree to that, opening up the prospect of Americans being tried in Iraqi courts and subjected to Iraqi punishment. The negotiations were strained following WikiLeaks' release of a diplomatic cable that alleged Iraqi civilians, including children, were killed in a 2006 raid by American troops rather than in an airstrike as the U.S. military initially reported. U.S. troops have already started the drawdown. For instance, a brigade from Fort Bliss, Texas, that was originally scheduled to be among the last to leave Iraq was being pulled out of the country months ahead of its planned departure, military officials told CNN last week. Besides withdrawing more units, others will not head overseas as planned. That includes about 775 Georgia-based soldiers from the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, which announced Friday it will not deploy to Iraq in December as previously scheduled. Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, has said that Iraq wouldn't be able to defend its borders if U.S. troops pulled out and also questioned Iraqi forces ability to defend its airspace. But Panetta, en route to Indonesia, said history shows that Iraq will be ready. ""We've taken out now about 100,000 troops and yet the level of violence has remained relatively low,"" the defense secretary said. ""And I think that's a reflection of the fact that the Iraqis have developed a very important capability here to be able to respond to security threats within their own country."" Regardless, officials insisted that the drastic pullback of troops does not mean an end to the U.S. government's presence in Iraq. State Department spokesman Mark Toner described Friday's development as the start of ""a new chapter in our relationship"" with Iraq -- while acknowledging the challenges of the change. ""You can't flip a switch and go from a military operation to a civilian operation; there has to be a transition and we're working on that transition,"" he said. ""But we believe we're ready."" Toner also noted substantial improvements in the capabilities of  the Iraqis, even as he admitted the continued importance of addressing ""security needs"" of the hundreds of nonmilitary U.S. personnel who will remain there. That includes about 1,700 diplomats, law enforcement officers and various economic, agriculture and other professionals and experts who will be in Iraq into 2012, according to the State Department. In addition, 5,000 security contractors will protect the U.S. diplomats and another 4,500 contractors will serve other roles, such as helping provide food and medical services, until they can be done locally. Toner said the U.S. and Iraqi governments are still talking about security and other matters, though he stressed any such discussions should not change the basic decision announced Friday. ""We continue to talk about the post-December 31 arrangement (and) security relationship,"" Toner said. ""At the same time, we are very committed to meeting the December 31 deadline."" Panetta, too, did not rule out the possibility that U.S. forces would head to Iraq to train forces there. ""As we ... look at developing this normal relationship, a lot of it is going to depend on what they want, what their needs are and how we can best meet them,"" he said.","U.S. defense chief says Iraqi forces are capable .

"Paul Ryan on Wednesday night told a story about then-presidential candidate Barack Obama telling automotive workers that government can help keep their plant going -- an account that Ryan reportedly got wrong previously. Did the Wisconsin congressman get it right as he accepted the GOP nomination for vice president at the Republican National Convention? Ryan discussed Obama's February 2008 speech at the General Motors plant in Janesville, Wisconsin -- a plant that eventually closed. According to Ryan, Obama had said that ""if our government is there to support you ... this plant will be here for another hundred years."" Fact Check: Rand Paul, Obama and debt . The statement: . ""When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory. A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: 'I believe that if our government is there to support you, this plant will be here for another hundred years.' That's what he said in 2008. Well, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day."" The facts: . First, some context. Ryan reportedly recalled this event incorrectly just days ago, during an August 16 speech in Ohio. Ryan reportedly alleged that Obama said he'd ""keep that plant open,"" and therefore broke his promise because the plant closed. ""That plant was shut down in 2009. I remember President Obama visiting it when he was first running, saying he'll keep that plant open,"" Ryan said, according to the Janesville Gazette. ""One more broken promise."" The Detroit News pointed out that Obama made no such promise in the February 13, 2008, speech, and indeed, we've seen no account suggesting that Obama did. Here is the quote at issue, according to an account kept by the Council on Foreign Relations: . ""I know that General Motors received some bad news yesterday, and I know how hard your governor has fought to keep jobs in this plant.  But I also know how much progress you've made -- how many hybrids and fuel-efficient vehicles you're churning out,"" Obama said. ""And I believe that if our government is there to support you, and give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition, that this plant will be here for another hundred years."" By ""bad news,"" Obama apparently was referring to GM's February 12, 2008, announcement that it had a $38.7 billion adjusted net loss for 2007. So, back on August 16 of this year, it does appear Ryan was wrong for saying Obama promised to keep it open. The News and the Gazette went further, reporting that the plant halted production in December 2008, and saying that Ryan essentially was criticizing Obama for failing to save a plant that closed before Obama took office. However, while December 2008 saw the end of the vast majority of the plant's work, the Gazette itself has reported that the plant didn't close fully until April 2009. Here's a timeline: . June 2008: GM announces that the Janesville plant will stop production of medium-duty trucks by the end of 2009, and stop production of large SUVs such as the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban and the GMC Yukon in 2010 or sooner, depending on market demand. December 23, 2008: SUV production ends, and more than 2,000 GM workers are laid off, according to the Gazette. Medium truck production continues. April 23, 2009: The plant's medium-duty assembly line, which produced an Isuzu line, closes, ending vehicle production at the plant and resulting in the loss of 57 production jobs, according to the Gazette. GM then put the plant on standby, meaning it could reactivate the facility if it decides it needs to ramp up production. Now, compare Ryan's Wednesday night statement with the one he gave on August 16. On Wednesday, Ryan said nothing of Obama making a promise, but rather quoted him. The quote is truncated (in Ryan's prepared remarks released to the media, an ellipsis replaces the missing words, ""give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition"") but essentially is correct. The only thing Ryan appears to have gotten technically wrong in Wednesday's version was saying that the plant didn't last another year. It did last another year -- more like 14 months -- if the Isuzu line and its 57 workers count. So, though Ryan might have been incorrect in the August 16 telling, he cleaned it up for Wednesday's convention. Obama said what Ryan said he said. But to fairly evaluate Obama's statement, at least two pieces of context -- missing from Ryan's account -- would be useful: First, that Obama wasn't telling this plant that he'd save it from a pending closure. He wasn't addressing a plant that he knew to be closing, because the closure announcement didn't come until four months after his speech. Second, although the plant's last bit of production stopped early in Obama's presidency and the plant remains closed, the closure was planned before Obama became president. Verdict: True, but incomplete. Fact Check: Paul Ryan misleads on debt panel's spending cut plan .","Paul Ryan criticizes '08 Barack Obama quote about GM plant .

"They can already deliver pizzas, monitor endangered species and rain down Hellfire missiles from an altitude of 50,000 feet. But could the drone that follows us as we go about our daily business now be upon us? Maybe so if the Mind4 quadcopter by Shanghai based startup, AirMind, reaches its funding target on crowdfunding website, Kickstarter. The nimble device has already been dubbed the ""stalker drone"" in early media coverage due to its ability to film and follow a designated person or target. While that's not necessarily the most complimentary label, Mind4's creators don't see it as a snooper's ideal gadget. ""This technology is actually not suitable for that kind of task,"" said AirMind founder, Ning Lu because of its high visibility and the difficulty of operating incognito in a busy public space. Rather, Lu sees the product being used by skiers, snowboarders, cyclists and the like to record awe-inspiring aerial shots of their daring activities. ""Mind4 is designed to be used to follow yourself, non-human being subjects such as animals, or in specific scenarios like film shooting, sports shooting etc. in relatively open area,""Lu said. How does it work? It uses what the promotional literature describes as the most ""powerful processor"" ever contained within a drone, the Mind4 syncs up with a specially designed Android smartphone app. All a prospective user needs to do is open the app to make the drone take off. They then choose a target to follow via the camera on their phone and hit start. Mind4 will then track the selected item from up to 20 meters (65 feet) above and at maximum distance of up to 50 meters (164 feet) behind using its autopilot feature. It can also respond to human hand signals. Waiving a right hand will instruct the device to come closer, raising both hands will make it take a picture while pointing the ground tells it to land. Reaching new heights . Quadcopter drones with mounted cameras are already widely available but most require a remote pilot to guide them. Some also use GPS systems to track subjects automatically, however Lu said such products are less reliable than Mind4. ""GPS-based following technology cannot ensure the subject is actually in that position (where the camera points)"" as civilian GPS is often not precise, he said. ""The camera on the drone may be pointing to 20 meters away from the subject, which will be totally out of view,"" he added. By comparison, Mind4 uses computer vision technology which allows for a much more reliable image capture. Then there is the potential of developing the technology that underpins the Mind4. Lu describes plans to make the software the device runs on open source so that users can create their own, modified Android apps. ""With the power of developers all around the world the Mind4 can be boosted to (the) next level ... much more friendly and smarter,"" he said. An industry flying high . Given the rapid growth of consumer drone products in recent years, it's perhaps no surprise that an item such as the Mind4 has come along. According to a recent study by aerospace sector analysts the Teal Group, the global unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry could be worth as much as $91 billion over the next ten years. The Mind4 is looking for a relatively small sum of money to get off the ground. Lu and his colleagues are hoping to raise $100,000 on Kickstarter before December 23 to help the device reach the next stage of its development. Until then, take-off and all the pretty images that will go with it are on hold.","Mind4 drone can automatically follow and take pictures of specially selected targets .

"The five victims in last week's shooting at a Washington high school were invited to the same lunch table by the shooter. ""It's our understanding he (invited them) via texting,"" Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary told reporters Monday. Witnesses say Jaylen Fryberg, a popular freshman, opened fire Friday in the crowded lunchroom at Marysville-Pilchuck High School, about 34 miles north of Seattle. Fryberg sent a selfie to his ex-girlfriend showing himself holding a gun not long before the attack, a law enforcement official told CNN. It is unclear if it is the same .40 caliber pistol used in the deadly shootings. He killed Zoe Galasso, 14, at the scene and wounded four others before taking his own life, authorities said. Gia Soriano, 14, who had been in critical condition with head injuries, died at a hospital, the Providence Regional Medical Center said late Sunday night. ""We are devastated by this senseless tragedy,"" Gia's family said in a statement. ""Gia is our beautiful daughter and words cannot express how much we will miss her."" The family will donate her organs. Condition critical . Of the other three who remain hospitalized, Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, and Andrew Fryberg, 15, are in critical condition. Nate Hatch, 14, is in satisfactory condition. Andrew and Nate were Jaylen's cousins. Don Hatch, Nate's grandfather, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that the teenager was walking with the aid of nurse when he went to see the youngster Monday morning. ""He just wants to let people know that he's OK. He's getting better,"" Don Hatch said. Nate Hatch has another surgery scheduled for Thursday and has been told that due to facial injuries he can never play football again. Will there be answers? Students, parents and school leaders met inside the gym at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Sunday to remember, mourn and talk about ways to move forward. Students and parents were separated for private discussions. ""My feeling is that God knows what happened and I think we all ought to leave it alone and leave it there because I don't think we're really going to find out really totally what happened,"" Don Hatch said. Hatch said Jaylen's family is struggling and like everyone else wants to know why this happened. 'It wasn't just random' Investigators in Marysville have not provided details, but students offered up accounts that painted a terrifying, chaotic picture. Fellow student Jordan Luton was finishing his lunch in the cafeteria when he heard a loud bang. He saw Jaylen go up to a table of students, ""came up from behind ... and fired about six bullets into the backs of them,"" Jordan told CNN. ""They were his friends, so it wasn't just random."" According to a law enforcement source, witnesses said Jaylen pulled the gun out of a black backpack before he began firing. Witnesses described the look on his face as calm, said the source. Teacher's heroism . There may have been more victims but for the bold actions of a young teacher. Megan Silberberger, a teacher, was in a nearby office when she heard the shots, said Randy Davis, president of the Marysville Education Association. ""She ran into the cafeteria and saw students down,"" said Davis. Silberberger also saw a gunman. ""She ran towards the shooter,"" he said, ""to stop ... and help secure (him)."" Davis would not reveal details of the confrontation. Silberberger declined CNN's request to be interviewed but issued this statement: ""I am thankful and grateful for the support from everyone. At this time I am requesting privacy."" Trouble reloading . A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Jaylen was indeed having trouble reloading and that it was because his hands were trembling. Police have not yet said how many shots were fired, but Jaylen had at least one bullet left before the confrontation with Silberberger, because the final shot was the one that ended Jaylen's life. A Beretta .40-caliber handgun believed to have been used in the shooting has been traced to Jaylen's father, according to the source. The sheriff confirmed the weapon was a Beretta, but only said that it was registered and owned by a ""family member."" Authorities are trying to determine how the shooter got the gun, Trenary said. Share your perspective on guns with CNN iReport . Grief, disbelief . By all accounts, Jaylen was a popular student. Just a week ago, he had been named the high school's freshman homecoming prince. ""It's weird to think about, because you see him and he is such a happy person,"" sophomore Alex Pietsch said. ""You never really see him be so angry and so upset. ...

"When the guests around your Thanksgiving table are busy stuffing their bellies today, here's one way to break the lull in conversation: dazzle them with some tasty turkey trivia. Here's 9 to get you started. We bet you they'll eat them up! 1. A tradition is born: TV dinners have Thanksgiving to thank. In 1953, someone at Swanson misjudged the number of frozen turkeys it would sell that Thanksgiving -- by 26 TONS! Some industrious soul came up with a brilliant plan: Why not slice up the meat and repackage with some trimmings on the side?Thus, the first TV dinner was born! 2. Going shopping?:  Not if you're a plumber. Black Friday is the busiest day of the year for them, according to Roto-Rooter, the nation's largest plumbing service. After all, someone has to clean up after household guests who ""overwhelm the system."" 3. This land is my land: There are four places in the United States named Turkey. Louisiana's Turkey Creek is the most populous, with a whopping 435 residents. There's also Turkey, Texas; Turkey, North Carolina; and Turkey Creek, Arizona. Oh, let's not forget the two townships in Pennsylvania: the creatively named Upper Turkeyfoot and Lower Turkeyfoot! 4. Leaving a legacy: When Abe Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday, it was thanks to the tireless efforts of a magazine editor named Sarah Josepha Hale. Her other claim to fame? She also wrote the nursery rhyme, ""Mary Had a Little Lamb."" 5. Gobble, gobble?: Not so fast. Only male turkeys, called toms, gobble. Females, called hens, cackle. 6. Ben's bird: If Ben Franklin had his way, the turkey would be our national bird. An eagle, he wrote in a letter to his daughter, had ""bad moral character."" A turkey, on the other hand, was a ""much more respectable bird."" 7. Born in the U.S.A.: Thanksgiving is not just an American holiday. Canadians celebrate it too. Except they do it the second Monday in October. 8. Don't blame the bird: You stuffed yourself, and now you're feeling sleepy, very sleepy. But it ain't the tryptophan in the turkey. In fact, chickens have more tryptophan. You're groggy because you overate. And digesting all that grub takes a lot of energy. 9. Talking turkey: Why is it called a turkey? Oh boy, this will take some explainin'. Back in the day, the Europeans took a liking to the guinea fowls imported to the continent. Since the birds were imported by Turkish merchants, the English called them turkeys. Later, when the Spaniards came to America, they found a bird that tasted like those guinea fowls. When they were sent to Europe, the English called these birds ""turkeys"" as well.","Black Friday is the busiest day for plumbers .
Ben Franklin wanted the turkey as our national bird .

"Can someone please explain to me the details of Obamacare? And when I say ""someone,"" I'm looking at you, President Obama -- or at least members of your administration. I can't fathom how Obama, one of the best orators of modern-day politics, could be such a poor advocate for what's arguably the crowning legislative achievement of his administration. I can assure you that if there were a law named after me -- such as ""Obeidallahcare"" or ""Deanaid"" -- I would be crisscrossing the country explaining it so people would understand and support it. Sure, most of us get the broad strokes of the Affordable Care Act commonly known as Obamacare: the individual mandate, coverage for the uninsured, children on parents' policy until 26, carriers cannot deny you coverage or charge you more due to a pre-existing condition. But the law is close to 1,000 pages and will spur hundreds, if not thousands, of regulations. What else does the law offer, and how will Americans be able to gain access to its benefits? Will Obamacare help primary care? We hear about state health insurance exchanges going into effect in October, but in the same breath we hear that many governors won't implement them. We hear about the individual mandate obligating everyone to buy health insurance by 2014 or face a penalty, but then we hear the Obama administration has delayed the requirement that employers with more than 50 employees be required to provide health coverage until 2015. It's remarkable that there's such confusion surrounding a piece of legislation signed into law more than three years ago -- in March 2010. And I'm far from alone on this. A poll in April found that 40% of Americans didn't even know if Obamacare is still in effect, which translates into roughly 130 million Americans not even knowing if the law still exists, let alone understanding the details of it. Even more concerning is that a recent poll of doctors found by a wide margin that they are ""not at all familiar"" with how certain key provisions of the law will be implemented. And astoundingly, it appears that Democratic members of Congress don't even fully grasp how Obamacare will be put into effect. That point was made crystal clear when Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, one of the early champions of the law, recently labeled the rollout of Obamacare ""a huge train wreck coming down."" In response, Obama's chief of staff has been spending time over the past three months giving presentations to Democrats in Congress so they can better understand the law. Who loses out under Obamacare? What's even more surprising is that Obama has allowed the void of information from his end to be filled almost unchallenged by Republicans, who have been actively working to define the law in the worst possible terms.  Unless Obama is mimicking the rope-a-dope fighting strategy made famous by Muhammad Ali, his administration's outreach to the public on Obamacare has been an abysmal failure. The consequence of Obama ceding the battlefield can be seen in a new poll that found 54% of Americans disapprove of the law and a record-high 39% want Congress to repeal it. The poll also found just 13% of Americans say the health care law will personally ""help me,"" but 38% believe the law will personally ""hurt me."" Maybe it was these poll numbers or perhaps being pushed by members of his own party, but it seems that Obama is finally aware of the public relations nightmare and possible policy failure staring him in the face. The administration has recently started organizing faith-based and community groups to help get out the word.  The federal government just launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to educate people about coverage options under Obamacare. It has even secured the support of the people at the Funny or Die comedy website to produce videos with well-known comedic actors explaining Obamacare -- because nothing says ""comedy gold"" like a law about health insurance. Obama meets with celebs who want to promote Obamacare . But why didn't Obama utilize his great communication skills to explain this law to us sooner? Why hasn't he traveled across the country waging something akin to his election campaign to sell his program? And it's not like Obama doesn't see the value in taking his ideas directly to the American public to build support. Indeed, we saw Obama use this very tactic last week as he kicked off the first of a series of speeches regarding his proposals to strengthen and grow the economy. The president did mention Obamacare in that speech, pointing out that ""the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down. Just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50% less than what they pay today."" And what's even more bizarre is that polls show strong support for many key provisions of Obamacare. The president could have (and should have) been touting these popular parts of the law for years, given that 61% of Americans favor allowing children to stay on the policy until they are 26 and 82% like the ban on insurance carriers from denying coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Could it be that Obama isn't waging such a campaign because even he can't explain this mammoth program in a way that will attract support? Is it possible that the president's idealistic dream of what Obamacare was intended to be has been replaced three years later by an administrative nightmare? The real reason why the Obama administration has remained largely invisible as Republicans have pummeled Obamacare may never truly be known. But it's clear that Obamacare needs a massive infusion of PR care if it is going to succeed.

"On the vast plains of the Altiplano plateau in South America live people who believe in magic. Many of the Aymara -- an ancient, indigenous race found in Bolivia, Peru and Chile -- suppose that on Tuesdays and Fridays, ordinary people become vulnerable to harmful spirits and the evil eye. That's why on those days they stay awake and on their guard until dawn. And that is why they get together and smoke. ""When you exhale the smoke, you send back the evil spells to the sender,"" says Raphaël Verona, a Swiss photographer who has just released a new book of photographs of traditional Aymara communities. ""You must also constantly pay homage to the spirits. There is a great variety of different spirits, such as the earth mother Pachamama, Supay, the god of the underworld, and the Virgin Mary."" Earth Mother; God of the Underworld; and the Virgin Mary. From the point of view of the Aymara, there isn't an odd one out. A blend of animism and Catholicism . Catholicism first arrived in the region with the Spanish colonialists in the 16th Century. The early missionaries tried to encourage indigenous people to accept the Catholic God by reinterpreting their own spirits:  Pachamama, they said, was Mary, and Supai was the devil. But the match was largely erroneous. Unlike the Catholic gods, the indigenous spirits were not seen as wholly good nor wholly bad. They were believed to be capricious yet compassionate; though they could cause calamities when slighted, they could be powerful allies when appeased. Moreover, from the point of view of the Aymara, the terrifying appearance of spirits like Supai, who is depicted with horns and a scarlet face, did not simply signify evil. Rather, it was a reflection of power, which could be used for good or ill. Because of these irreconcilable cultural differences (which the missionaries had failed to appreciate), Catholic gods were simply added into the Aymara pantheon. Christian rituals became blended with traditional beliefs, adding another dimension to this colorful, hybrid faith. Elaborate traditional ceremonies such as Tinku and the Oruo carnival, which involve costumes, dancing and singing, are still practiced as they have been since time immemorial. But Catholic saints are included alongside the local deities. The paradox of the Aymara . ""The Aymara people have an approach to life that seems paradoxical from the outside,"" says Verona. ""In Europe you are either one religion or another, either traditional or modern. ""But in Bolivia people live with both Catholicism and animism, both in modernity and in their ancestral traditions. ""They visit the Yatiri, the priest, to pay homage to deities or give prophesies when they are applying for visas, or for assistance in businesses matters."" Despite their acceptance of modernity, the Aymara also have little truck with the idea that the spirits might not be literally real. ""Traditional stories are seen to be as true as the people talking to you at this moment,"" Verona explains. ""If you ask someone if Supai, the god of the mines and the underworld, lives, they will say of course because they heard stories about it. So myths come to life very strongly in this society."" The theater of worship . Verona first encountered the Aymara when he was living in Bolivia four years ago. There he met his wife-to-be, who is from the Aymara community, and began to meet her family and wider circle. ""I found myself entering an alien and beautiful culture,"" he says. ""My parents-in-law would regularly carry out rituals involving offerings of cocoa leaves, alcohol, threads of dyed wool, sugar, and molded figures to the spirits."" It was the costumes that particularly impressed him. Enchanted by the striking masks and outfits worn by shamans and dancers, he headed back to Switzerland and convinced his friend, the photographer Thomas Rousset, to collaborate in a photography project. Many of the portraits were staged in people's homes, offering a contrived, theatre-like effect; others were taken as ""snapshots"". Together, this collection offers a potent evocation of this unusual and thought-provoking way of life. ""It is extraordinary to see this rich native tradition that challenges Western thinking,"" Verona says. ""I think there is much we can learn from them.""

"ISIS is a cancer that must be stamped out, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry wrote Saturday in an opinion piece for The New York Times. Kerry called the Islamist extremist group, known for beheadings, crucifixions and terror campaigns against religious and ethnic minorities, a ""unifying threat to a broad array of countries"" that needs to be confronted. His article appears in the aftermath of the political uproar that engulfed the White House this week after President Barack Obama said ""we don't have a strategy"" on ISIS in Syria. Obama's no 'strategy yet' comment on ISIS in Syria sparks a political uproar . The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State, has grabbed headlines just as certainly as it has gobbled up territory across northern Iraq over the summer. A companion opinion piece in the Times, co-authored by Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, concurred that ISIS poses a serious threat, but argue for an immediate response with a military plan at its center. The ISIS threat only grows over time, and Obama must act with more urgency, the senators wrote. ""Doing too little to combat ISIS has been a problem. Doing less is certainly not the answer now,"" they wrote. The next move . U.S. airstrikes against ISIS fighters have slowed their advance, and the Obama administration is weighing whether to expand the assault into Syria. But, Kerry said, any decision will require a joint effort with international partners. ""With a united response led by the United States and the broadest possible coalition of nations, the cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread to other countries,"" Kerry wrote. ""The world can confront this scourge, and ultimately defeat it. ISIS is odious, but not omnipotent."" Former CIA chief: Matter of time before ISIS tries to attack West . McCain and Graham said the next move must include a squeezing of ISIS financing, and a successful and inclusive Iraqi government that is inclusive of Iraqi Sunnis, rather than pushing them toward terrorist groups. ""But ultimately, ISIS is a military force, and it must be confronted militarily,"" the senators wrote. Obama has ordered airstrikes on ISIS in northern Iraq, but ""they have been tactical and reactive half-measures,"" McCain and Graham wrote. ""Continuing to confront ISIS in Iraq, but not in Syria, would be fighting with one hand tied behind our back. We need a military plan to defeat ISIS, wherever it is."" Building a coalition . The secretary of state's message echoes that of the White House, with both the President and Press Secretary Josh Earnest calling this week for an international coalition to confront the threat. ""Airstrikes alone won't defeat this enemy. A much fuller response is demanded from the world,"" Kerry wrote. To build that coalition, Kerry, along with  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, will meet with European allies on the sidelines of the NATO meeting in Wales next week. Then, it's off to the Middle East to drum up support from the region. What can the U.S. do against ISIS in Syria -- and could it work? ""Already our efforts have brought dozens of nations to this cause,"" Kerry argued in the Times piece. ""Certainly there are different interests at play. But no decent country can support the horrors perpetrated by ISIS, and no civilized country should shirk its responsibility to help stamp out this disease.""

"(CNN) -- New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson signed a bill Wednesday repealing the death penalty in his state, his office confirmed. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson signed legislation repealing the state's death penalty. ""Regardless of my personal opinion about the death penalty, I do not have confidence in the criminal justice system as it currently operates to be the final arbiter when it comes to who lives and who dies for their crime,"" Richardson said in a statement Wednesday. He noted that more than 130 death row inmates have been exonerated in the past 10 years, including four in New Mexico. ""Faced with the reality that our system for imposing the death penalty can never be perfect, my conscience compels me to replace the death penalty with a solution that keeps society safe,"" he said. With the governor's decision, New Mexico joins 14 other states that don't impose the death penalty. Several other states, including Colorado, Kansas, Maryland and Montana, are considering changes to their capital punishment laws.  See which states have bills to do away with capital punishment » . The bill replaces the death penalty with life without the possibility of parole. New Mexico currently has two men on death row and has executed one person -- convicted child killer Terry Clark, in 2001 -- since the United States reinstated the death penalty in 1976. As the legislation is written, it will not affect current death row inmates. ""Throughout my adult life, I have been a firm believer in the death penalty as a just punishment -- in very rare instances, and only for the most heinous crimes. I still believe that,"" Richardson, a Democrat, said. ""The issue became more real to me because I knew the day would come when one of two things might happen: I would either have to take action on legislation to repeal the death penalty, or more daunting, I might have to sign someone's death warrant."" Rep. Gail Chasey, who first introduced House Bill 285 in 1999, said the bill would relieve families of the burden of a lengthy death penalty trial and appellate phase and restore the focus to crime victims. ""Every time there is a court hearing, a conviction, an appeal, the focus is on the defendant, but the family still has to go through it all again and again. It's very, very hard for the families. It reopens the wounds each time,"" she said. The legislation will also spare the state cost of mounting a death penalty trial, which Casey said typically costs more than a non-death penalty trial. ""We can put that money toward enhancing law enforcement, public works, you name it,"" she said. Richardson also said he was troubled by the fact that minorities are ""over-represented in the prison population and on death row."" Minorities make up more than half of the death row population nationwide, according to the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit group that opposes the death penalty. The American Civil Liberties Union said Richardson's decision should ""send a powerful message to other states"" about the need to reevaluate ""our error-prone, discriminatory and bankrupting system of capital punishment."" Local and state law enforcement associations opposed the bill. Richardson agreed the death penalty is a tool to deter crime, but said it was not the only tool. ""For some would-be criminals, the death penalty may be a deterrent,"" he said. ""But it's not, and never will be, for many, many others."" The state legislature approved the measure last Friday. Prior to signing the legislation, Richardson received thousands of e-mails and phone calls weighing in on the matter. As of noon Wednesday, the governor's office said it had received 10,847 phone calls, e-mails and walk-in comments from people who wanted to voice their opinions on the legislation. Of those, 8,102 were for a repeal of the death penalty and 2,745 were against it, according to Richardson's office. In addition, Richardson met Monday with more than 100 New Mexicans to discuss the issue, his office said. Other states also have considered repealing their capital punishment laws this year. In Kansas, state senators voted Monday to send such a bill back to committee, The Kansas City Star reported. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","NEW: ACLU says move sends message about need to reevaluate system .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A gunman in an Afghan Border Police uniform who killed six U.S. troops was a reliable officer who had been with the force for three years, a senior official said Wednesday. But the Taliban claimed that Hezatullah had been a member of the militant group who joined the border police precisely to launch an attack on U.S. forces. Six U.S. troops died Monday when a gunman opened fired on NATO-led service members, the Pentagon said. Hezatullah, a 23-year-old who goes by one name, was a trusted member of the border police and had been receiving training from coalition forces, said Aminullah Amarkhil, commander of the border police in eastern Nangarhar province. ""Afghan and NATO forces have launched a joint investigation into this incident, and preliminary reports suggest that there is no reason to believe that Hezatullah was not trustworthy,"" Amarkhil said. But Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, claimed responsibility for the attack and said Hezatullah had been planning such an assault all along. ""He has been waiting for the right moment, and now he finally achieved his goal."" Mujahid said. CNN could not independently confirm the Taliban claim. The shooting broke out during a training mission in eastern Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force said in a news release. A joint Afghan and ISAF team is investigating. The suspect also was killed in the incident, the ISAF said. Spokesman David Lapan confirmed the deaths, and said no names are being released pending notification of the families.","The Taliban says the gunman had been plotting an attack all along .

"What kind of font are you? Which do you find most attractive? And how can this help with your love life? This might sound like copy from a cheap dating website. But according to Sarah Hyndman, a British designer specializing in typography, our taste in fonts reveals more about us than we'd expect. ""Fonts form a kind of language of their own, and we are all unconsciously fluent in it,"" she says when I visit her studio in Hackney, north London. ""Each font gives a different message and atmosphere, and we instinctively understand that. Typefaces have a deep significance for everyone."" In other words, they may reveal who we really are. And what we desire. Smelling fonts . Hyndman recently gave a lecture at the London Design Festival that explored the complex network of associations triggered by different fonts. By way of demonstration, she lines up three bottles on the table, next to a sample of three fonts: Comic Sans, Times New Roman and Helvetica. As bizarre as it sounds, my job is to match up the bottles and fonts using only my sense of smell. The first bottle, when opened, smells of bubblegum. There's no question that this is Comic Sans. The second gives out the aroma of coffee: Times New Roman. And the last one contains a neutral, Helvetica odor. It was surprisingly easy. ""More than 80% of people give the same answer,"" she says. ""This shows how deeply typography is embedded in our psyche."" Hyndman is working with scientists at the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University to establish the links between certain fonts and our senses, including taste, hearing and smell. ""We've found that rounded fonts are commonly associated with deep reds and sweet tastes,"" she says. ""Jagged, angular typefaces evoke salty or sour tastes, and harsh sounds. ""This may be based in evolution. When our ancestors were foraging, sweet, sugary foods were the supreme energy source. And they used all their senses to identify them."" Finding love . How can all of this be applied to the game of love? To illustrate, Hyndman takes out another collection of props: candy bags with different fonts pinned to the outside. This time, my job is to choose the one that best reflects my personality, and the one that would represent a desirable partner. I think for a moment, and decide that Gill Sans is the most ""me"". Inside the bag -- in addition to font-shaped candy -- is a description of my personality. ""You are a traditionalist, your news comes via the BBC and you use correct grammar in texts and tweets,"" it says. ""Your ability to communicate clearly and in a friendly tone of voice will being future opportunities your way."" This analysis is based on the cultural context of the Gill Sans font, which was created in 1926 by Eric Gill, who was inspired by Edward Johnston's iconic London Underground typeface. It was quickly adopted by British Rail and Penguin Books, as well as the BBC. So the fact that I was drawn to it, apparently, indicates that I'm an establishment kind of guy. To which I respond: meh. What about my ideal partner? I dither for a moment, then plump for Caslon. It seems elegant, characterful and balanced, somehow. The perfect type? My ideal woman, I discover, has ""strong ties to [her] home but has travel in [her] future. [She] will be influential in the Americas"". This is because Caslon, though invented in Britain in the 18th Century, became extremely popular in America. It was Benjamin Franklin's favorite font, and was used both on the Presidential Seal and the Declaration of Independence. Now, my wife has no significant connections to the United States. But I do write for CNN (whose logo, Hyndman says, is ""sweet with a little bit of savory, a little twist of crunch""). Perhaps my choice of fonts actually describes my employer? Either way, it is a good idea to try out Hyndman's online font-based personality test. Admittedly, it's not completely watertight. But it might just increase your chances of finding someone that is just your type. For those interested to know more, Sarah Hyndman has launched a new series of ""Tuesday Type Tastings"" in London.

"The whisky glows like a candle in the bottom of the glass. Its aroma is rich, deep, musky, inviting. But dare I take a sip? This is the new Balvenie 50-year-old, which carries a price tag of £25,000 ($40,800) a bottle. Which means that the single dram I am holding is worth about £830 ($1,350). Slowly, I raise it to my lips. I am standing in the whisky room at the luxurious Cromlix hotel in Dunblaine, Scotland -- which incidentally is owned by local boy tennis star Andy Murray -- along with a select group of journalists. We have been invited to the exclusive launch of the new 50-year-old, which is only the fourth time the distillery has released a whisky of this age. ""A 50-year-old Macallan featured in (the film) Skyfall, but whiskies of this age are extremely unusual,"" says Sam Simmons, global brand ambassador for The Balvenie, who is introducing us to the latest release. ""Nobody 50 years ago knew that people would care about Scotch the way they do in 2014. Nobody planned to leave this whisky for so long. Its existence is a bit of a miracle."" We tilt our glasses. The butter-colored liquid is rich with notes of cloves, summer flowers, dried fruits and marzipan, underpinned by the woody polish of an old gymnasium. ""It tastes like soap,"" somebody says. ""You've eaten soap?"" Simmons replies. There is a pause. ""It reminds me of the inside of a grand piano,"" ventures someone else. ""Whisky of this age has a natural alcohol level of below 50%,"" Simmons explains. ""That's when very unpredictable chemical reactions happen between the spirit and the wood. That's the magic time. It creates whisky that is unique, quirky and unpredictable."" Whisky collectors are making big money . As extraordinary as this whisky is -- it is exceptionally long, with flavor lingering for several minutes after each sip -- one question is in the back of everyone's mind. Who would pay £25,000 for a bottle of whisky? The answer is people like Mahesh Patel, a whisky collector and building tycoon from Atlanta, Georgia, who once bought a Dalmore Trinitas 64-year-old for £100,000 ($166,000). ""I have about 5,000 bottles, including a lot of old, one-off, high-end whiskies,"" he says. ""Over the years, I've spent about $2 million on it. The collection is worth about $6 million now. I keep it at different locations all over the world, for security reasons."" Patel is one of a breed of whisky collectors that have found that their passion for the drink has led to great financial gains. Distilleries first hit on the idea of limited editions and special releases in the early Nineties, such as the famous Black Bowmore that came in a wooden presentation case. Collectors like Patel bought the bottles largely for the love of them. But over the decades, their value started to appreciate to the extent that unusual bottles started to be seen as cash cows. Fast-forward to 2014, and the market is booming. According to the Investment Grade Scotch index that is compiled by UK-based Whisky Highland, the top 100 whiskies appreciated by an average of 440% in the last six years. Last month, a 50-year-old bottle of Japanese Yamazaki single malt sold for £20,000 ($33,000). In January, Sotheby's sold a six-liter decanter of Macallan M for £387,000 ($631,000). These transactions are becoming relatively frequent, if not commonplace. Indeed, Whisky Highland expect 30,000 bottles to be sold at auction this year, a 50% increase on the 20,211 that were sold in 2013. By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index increased by 31% in the same period, and the Live-ex Fine Wine 100 Index dropped by 2%. If you're a drinks investor with money to spend, it is something of a no-brainer. Is whisky for collecting or drinking? But most people in the whisky world see collecting purely for the sake of investment as something of a taboo. ""You have to start by drinking the product and enjoying the product,"" says Patel. ""Buy two bottles, one to drink and one to collect. Otherwise you're going against the spirit of the industry."" Andy Simpson, the founding director of Whisky Highland, agrees -- but only to a point. ""There are three types of buyers: drinkers, collectors and investors,"" he says. ""I know one person, who shall remain nameless, who is teetotal, and buys whisky only to invest. ""Some people think that this is a crime and whisky should be set free. But from my perspective, people can choose how to spend their money. It's supporting the industry and that's a good thing."" Simpson, a former corporate banker, is launching a new business called Rare Whisky 101, which he describes as ""consultants, brokers and valuers"". ""Whisky has always been collectable, but there were no market figures before Whisky Highland came along five years ago,"" he says. ""There were no indices, charts, graphs, nothing. Rare Whisky 101 will have the world's largest online database of whisky auction sales, so investors can accurately follow the market."" This is the latest contribution to the digital revolution that has transformed the secondary whisky market. Physical auction houses like Bonhams and Sotherby's have traditionally tended to charge 25% commission, and hold auctions just a few times a year. By contrast, sites like Scotch Whisky, Whisky Online, Just Whisky and Whisky Auctioneer run online auctions regularly, and charge a commission of just 10%. ""Those sites have added liquidity into a traditionally illiquid market,"" says Simpson. ""They are part of the reason why whisky is booming, and the growing value of whisky is starting to usurp the experience of opening and drinking it."" Whisky investment funds: too good to be true? The market is gradually showing signs of maturity. In June, the world's first whisky investment fund was set up by Rickesh Kishnano, the CEO of Platinum Wines in Hong Kong; another has been established in Singapore. But many seasoned collectors -- who themselves have made millions through buying and selling whisky -- are skeptical about whisky funds, and suggest that potential investors tread carefully. ""They worry me because genuine whisky experts are few and far between, and there is nobody credible behind these funds,"" says Sukhinder Singh, founder of the Whisky Exchange, who boasts a ""handsome"" private collection of 6,000 bottles that he keeps in his boardroom. ""They are run by people from the wine industry, but you need a lot of knowledge specifically about whisky to make good investments. It's not about just buying old whisky. I've been collecting for 30 years and I know everyone who is good. How many whiskies have these guys tried? Fifty? A hundred? That's not enough."" There are lots of hidden pitfalls, he says. For example, if you invest in a whisky that is not ""amazing to drink"", demand may remain low even if it is a limited edition. And while some bottles go up, it is common for others to lose value. For example, the Royal Wedding limited edition Macallan whisky, which marked the marriage between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, rose from £150 to £1,650 by 2013. These days, however, after the distillery lost many fans by removing age statements from its bottles, it has depreciated to about £900. By contrast, however, the iconic Macallan Private Eye whisky, which was released in 1996 to mark the 35th anniversary of the British satirical magazine, has appreciated from £35 to about £1,500, and shows no sign of falling from grace. Telling the difference between these two whiskies requires significant expertise. The importance of loving your whisky . According to Singh, when it comes to whisky collecting, there is no substitute for genuine passion. He still vividly remembers the first bottle in his collection. ""I visited a man in Scotland, and noticed a special bottle on his mantelpiece, with a beautiful, intensely colorful label,"" he says. ""It was an original bottling from a distillery called Kirkliston, which had closed in the early 1900s. ""I knew I had to have it. It took me half an hour to persuade him to sell it to me, for £700, which was a lot of money at the time. It's worth about £20,000 now, but I'll never sell it."" What advice would he offer an aspiring collector or investor? ""The whisky market is on fire at the moment, it really is,"" he says. ""But you can't become an expert overnight. ""As a rule of thumb, buy limited edition bottles from iconic distilleries. But most importantly, learn about whisky, meet the experts and talk to them, and drink as much as you can."" Back in the honeyed presence of The Balvenie 50-year-old, Sam Simmons is inclined to agree. ""Ultimately, whisky is about loving the mystery of the drink, conversation and friendship,"" he says. ""Whisky is to be drunk and enjoyed. However high the stakes get, you can never lose sight of that."" Battersea Power Station: The life, death and rebirth of a London icon .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats are signaling that a final health care bill will drop the government-run public health insurance option favored by liberals but rejected by conservatives from both parties. A House-Senate conference committee will begin negotiations next month on merging health care bills passed by the Democratic majorities in each chamber. However, voting in both chambers was extremely close, raising concerns that a compromise might fail to win the necessary final approval. One of the main differences between the two measures is the public option. The House bill contains the public option as a competitor to private insurers in a national heath insurance exchange open to people now unable to get coverage, but the Senate version lacks a public option. President Obama, who has made health care reform his top domestic priority this year, has expressed general support for a public option but stops short of insisting on the provision. Liberal Democrats in the House have said they want to keep the public option, but one of their leaders -- Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the chamber's third-ranking Democrat -- said Sunday that he could vote for a bill without the government insurance plan. ""We want a public option to do basically three things: create more choice for insurers, create more competition for insurance companies and to contain costs,"" Clyburn said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""So if we can come up with a process by which these three things can be done, then I'm all for it. Whether or not we label it a public option or not is of no consequence."" The Senate health care bill required the support of all 60 members of the Democratic caucus to overcome a Republican filibuster. Such precarious support allowed individual moderates in the Democratic caucus to wield major influence on the bill, with at least two -- Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Ben Nelson of Nebraska -- saying they would oppose the measure if it contained the public option. On Sunday, Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, acknowledged the reality of the Senate politics. Asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" about the public option, Van Hollen said, ""It's not dead, but we also recognize that the Senate was able to just muster the 60 votes."" The House could drop the public option if ""there are other mechanisms in whatever bill comes out that will keep down premiums,"" Van Hollen said. Supporters of a public option say it would provide nonprofit competition to private insurers that would bring down costs, but opponents contend that it is the first step toward a government takeover of the health care system. In place of a public option, the Senate bill includes a provision allowing private insurers to offer nonprofit coverage overseen by a government agency. Both the House and Senate bills would permit the creation of nonprofit private insurance cooperatives to increase competition.","Close votes in House, Senate raise fears that compromise might not win approval .

"The Boy Scouts of America is considering changing its longstanding policy against allowing openly gay members, according to a news release from the organization. The organization, which has 2.7 million members, is ""potentially discussing"" doing away with its national policy after months of protest, including hundreds of angry Eagle Scouts renouncing their hard-earned awards and mailing back their red-white-and-blue medals. Many parents of Scouts across America found the national policy excluding gays confusing -- and at odds with basic scouting ideals. Social media were abuzz with outrage over the policy; gay men who used to be Scouts spoke out in first-person blogs. On her TV talk show, Ellen DeGeneres featured a California Scout who had been denied his Eagle rank because he is gay. Members of the organization's national board are expected to bring up the issue at a regularly scheduled biannual meeting in February. Any change would be announced after that. Scouting goes through a rough patch . In the Scouts' statement Monday, the group indicated that the national board may consider passing any decisions on gay membership to the local level. Each troop's charter organization would be able to decide ""consistent with each organization's mission, principles, or religious beliefs."" ""The policy change under discussion would allow the religious, civic, or educational organizations that oversee and deliver Scouting to determine how to address this issue,"" the statement said. The statement itself is remarkable. Some members will see the fact that Scouting's national leadership is even discussing a policy change as a softening of its stance on gays and lesbians. But some Scouts and Scout parents say that passing the decision to the local level will have little effect on the ground, because many troops have been ignoring the national policy anyway. The announcement comes after Scouting's national headquarters received numerous complaints from a grass-roots campaign targeting the policy. In April, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation started calls for the Scouts to end the ban. The group applauded Monday's announcement. ""The Boy Scouts of America have heard from scouts, corporations and millions of Americans that discriminating against gay Scouts and Scout leaders is wrong,"" GLAAD President Herndon Graddick said. ""Scouting is a valuable institution, and this change will only strengthen its core principles of fairness and respect."" Opinion: Boy Scouts, time to end discrimination . The protest was sparked last year after Ohio Cub Scout den leader Jennifer Tyrrell was forced to step down from her position in her son's Cub Scout pack because she is openly gay. The father of a gay California Boy Scout whose application for Eagle rank was rejected by a Scout council hailed the BSA statement as ""a step in the right direction."" ""It's interesting that the BSA is leaking this beforehand,"" said Eric Andresen, whose son Ryan was denied the Eagle rank after being a Scout for more than a decade. ""We feel if they are going out with this much publicity they couldn't possibly say no now,"" said the elder Andresen, adding that his son sees the move also as ""a step in the right direction ... It's about time."" Meanwhile, conservative Family Research Council President Tony Perkins released a statement in response to Monday's announcement saying the Scouts organization ""would be making a serious mistake to bow to the strong-arm tactics of LGBT activists and open the organization to homosexuality."" Perkins added: ""What has changed in terms of the Boy Scouts' concern for the well-being of the boys under their care? Or is this not about the well-being of the Scouts, but the funding for the organization?"" Some critics who say that Scouts have failed to change with the times blame the connections to organized religion. Approximately 70% of Scout troops are affiliated with some kind of church or religious group, according to Boy Scouts of America spokesman Deron Smith. Scouts for Equality reports that 11 organization councils, which include more than 260,000 Scouts, have publicly protested the policy, according to GLAAD. The Catholic Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are among scouting's biggest backers, Boy Scouts of America says. In 2011, Mormon-backed Cub Scout and Boy Scout troops accounted for more than 420,000 of all Scouts nationwide. More than 200,000 Scouts were members of units affiliated with the Catholic Church. President Barack Obama -- the honorary head of the Scouts, as is every president -- supports gay and lesbians in Girl and Boy Scouts, as does former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a Mormon. Last year, the Girl Scouts allowed a transgender member into a troop, sparking a cookie boycott.

"Americans are told we need to have a national conversation in which we talk about race. And yet, when we have horrific crimes with white victims where the alleged perpetrators are African-American or Latino, we're told that we can't talk about race. This isn't true when the roles are reversed. If the victims are African-American or Latino, and the alleged perpetrator is white, we talk about race until our throats go dry. Confused? Join the club. If Americans don't understand it, how are we to explain any of this to the grieving family of Christopher Lane, a 22-year-old college baseball player from Melborne, Australia, who was recently gunned down while jogging in a neighborhood a world away -- Duncan, Oklahoma? According to police, the evidence suggests that the shooting was not premeditated and random. It could have been part of a gang initiation, according to a theory floated by the father of a boy who the three teenagers allegedly tried to recruit. But here's the headline: Prosecutors say that the killing was not about race, despite the fact that one alleged assailant left a long cyber trail on social media where he talked about hating ""woods"" (derogatory slang for white people) and glorified guns and violence. ""At this point, the evidence does not support the theory that Christopher Lane was targeted based upon his race or nationality,"" said District Attorney Jason Hicks. Eric Deggans: When racial clichés drive murder stories . As ghoulish as it sounds, it may be that the three teenagers responsible for the shooting -- 15-year-old James Edwards and 16-year-old Chancey Luna, who have been charged with first-degree murder, and 17-year-old Michael Long, who has been charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder for driving the car -- were simply bored and decided to kill someone. Unfortunately for Lane, who was visiting his girlfriend and her family, he was that someone. This could have been the media's narrative of the Oklahoma slaying, just another senseless act by messed-up teenagers who were raised on video games and think life resets when you press a button or drop in another quarter. That is, except for two things: The victim and the alleged perpetrators are of different races. (Lane is white, and Edwards and Luna -- the alleged shooters -- are African-American. Long, the alleged accomplice, is white.) And, as Americans, we are still living through the aftershocks of the not guilty verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman for shooting and killing Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida. Some Americans are still smarting over the fact that the Zimmerman verdict, and the shooting itself, were spun by grievance merchants and other social activists to be all about race. Now they want to know why there isn't a similar response over the killing in Oklahoma. In both cases, the central question is the same: Was the deceased targeted because of his race? In both cases, we still don't know the answer. Meanwhile, where is President Obama's awkward statement that, if he had a friend from Australia, he might look like Chris Lane? LZ Granderson: Negligent parents, lawbreaking kids . Some will say that the reason there has been no outcry from the activists is because authorities in Oklahoma insist that this case isn't about race. So what? The authorities in Florida also told us that what happened there wasn't about race. A lot of good that did. Some of the same folks who discounted the official explanation back then want us to accept it now. It doesn't work that way. I think it's time for that national conversation. There's nothing wrong with talking about race. Especially at a time in U.S. history when the concept is so complicated and confusing. The nation's 52 million Latinos aren't a race, but many of them -- especially in the Southwest -- are experiencing something that looks and smells a lot like racism. Obama is half-black and half-white, and yet he's referred to as the first black president not the 44th white one. Zimmerman, who is half-Peruvian and half-white, appears to have lived his life as a Hispanic until he shot an unarmed African-American teenager and the media decided it was necessary to label him a ""white Hispanic."" And, in an increasingly multicultural America, the census form looks like a relic from a simpler time where most Americans fit neatly into racial categories. What is the media supposed to do about all this? There's a debate over when to mention race and when to leave it out. The longstanding rule in journalism is that we shouldn't mention the race of someone accused of committing a crime unless it is relevant to the story. That rule seems half-baked. Why wouldn't a suspect's race be ""relevant"" -- especially when that suspect is still at large and the police need the public's help in locating him? It's a human characteristic. Would we leave out of a story any mention of one's gender or age, so we're not accused of sexism or ageism? Self-censorship isn't the answer. When a horrendous crime like this happens, we need more information not less. Besides, once we sanitize the news, or manipulate it to serve an agenda, it's no longer news. It's public relations. Or worse. Think of it as nanny journalism. Too many people in my profession have strayed from the mission of reporting what happened -- or in my field of opinion writing, telling you what we think about what happened -- to massaging what happened in order to advance some greater societal good. And when journalists -- either on our own, or at the direction of the people we work for -- impersonate social workers, we ask for trouble. We also surrender our credibility. And once that's gone, why should anyone listen to anything we say ever again?","Ruben Navarrette: A debate broke out over race and Oklahoma killing .

"London (CNN) -- A portrait artist promises to capture more than a photograph is ever able to: more than just a glimpse of a person's external appearance, a portrait can display a person as they truly are. But how does the artists do it? Jonathan Yeo is one of Britain's greatest portrait artists. Some of the world's most famous people -- Tony Blair, Nicole Kidman, Damien Hirst, Kevin Spacey, Prince Phillip, and Malala Yousafzai among them -- have sat to have their image -- and something of their essence -- captured by him. Here, he meets prima ballerina Tamara Rojo, artistic director and star dancer at the English National Ballet, and explains how to create a stunning portrait -- from choosing a subject to immortalizing them in paint - broken down into a series of six-second Vines. You want to choose people you're going to find interesting company. It doesn't even matter if you end up not liking them, if you find them interesting, then that makes for an interesting painting. It's only if you find someone boring, then that tends to make the whole process harder. At the start you're trying to get the overall shape of the picture and the composition. It's tricky when someone has got a very interesting and beautiful face. I'm torn between wanting to make it close up [to the face] -- and make it about the expression and intensity -- but at the same time the whole composition is really interesting. Sometimes you get lucky and it happens very quickly and the first idea works well, and you get stuck straight in. Sometimes it takes several goes. You might start one and not like it. Or you might like some bits of it, and start it again using some parts and not others. A portrait is basically a document of a relationship between the artist and the sitter, and that kind of changes as you get to know each other. What I'm doing is, although I'm using paint, I'm kind of drawing. The advantage of drawing straight onto the canvas is, the bits I like, I'll keep -- and then it could be that it'll stay as a study. Or it might be that I'll do another layer and another layer and then It'll become more three dimensional. At this stage you don't necessarily know what's going to happen. The idea is that I start by laying down an under-layer of the picture, probably in quite muted colors, like I'm doing here. And then once you're happy with the idea of it, that it's on the right lines, then I don't have to be quite so fixed or concentrating so hard. Actually, you start talking more and it's partly then you see the animation in people's faces. And then that's what makes the thing come alive. You've got very good, very strong eyes. It's important to get that right -- more than anything else. Sometimes it can take quite a long time but if you do get it right, that's sort of the way into the picture, it's the thing that captures someone's attention when they glance at it. If you get that right, it's hard for people to look away. It's a very powerful thing. You can't fake it. If someone doesn't have very interesting eyes, then you can't pretend. We are interested in faces more than other things. It's natural, we get so much more information about what's going on from other people's faces, expressions and reactions. So much of how we communicate isn't conscious, it's about how our faces react or don't react or betray how we're thinking or emphasize or exaggerate what we're saying, or contradict it. If people really want to look at it while I'm doing it, I'll let them, but on the basis that they don't say anything to me about it. Maybe right at the end I'll ask what they think, but in the middle you don't want anything that will influence or distort what you're planning on doing to it. It's not often easy to judge at the time when you've just done something whether it's good or not. You might like something on the day because it's what you were trying to do, but sometimes the best ones happen by accident. Because if it wasn't what you were trying to do that day, you don't see it as a success. And it's only by putting it away, forgetting about it, working on something else, coming back and finding it after, that you see it fresh and then you can be more objective about it. It's nice having someone sit, but at the same time, the most interesting people are busy and haven't got all day. Some things you can do without the person -- the dress and the pose you can do from the photos -- but then you try to get people back to sit for you for the face and the expression, . For that bit, the photo doesn't tell the whole story: you want to see, not just how someone looks, but how a person moves and how they react to things, and if you can get those things in, that's what makes it come alive, really, and makes it more interesting than a photo.","Master portrait artist Jonathan Yeo explains how he paints a portrait in six second Vines .

"Iran may need only a month to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb, a U.S.-based anti-proliferation group says in a new assessment of Tehran's enrichment program. But that is only if the country were able to take the most extreme and direct enrichment path, says the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington. Under other scenarios, it would take significantly longer for Tehran to produce the material -- more than 11 months in one estimate. And that would still not give Iran a nuclear bomb. Turning enriched uranium into a usable weapon would take a great deal more time, the report suggests. The warning Thursday from ISIS was released as U.S. lawmakers consider legislation that could tighten sanctions on Iran until a deal is reached on the Middle Eastern country's nuclear program. It also comes after talks resumed on the program between Iran and six world powers -- the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain -- known as the P5+1. The report examines scenarios under which Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium to make a nuclear bomb -- and ""break out"" of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In a statement that described the report as ""extremely alarming,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, urged the United States to consider all options, including the use of military force, ""to prevent Iran from acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons. We all want negotiations to succeed, but time is clearly running out."" The report adds to the sense of urgency over the talks, said Shashank Joshi, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. But, he noted, not all analysts share the group's view. He said it would be difficult for Iran to secretly work toward a bomb without kicking out international inspectors. ISIS appears to have overestimated the pace of Iran's nuclear development in the past, however. In a December 2008 report, it said Iran was expected to reach a nuclear weapons capability ""during 2009 under a wide variety of scenarios."" The Iranian government declared the report baseless. ""This is a huge lie because, according to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, production, storage and use of weapons of mass destruction are haraam (forbidden by Islam),"" said Marzieh Afkham, a  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman. ""Weapons of mass destruction have no place in the Islamic Republic's doctrine. This kind of report is totally false."" Nuclear Power/IAEA Fast Facts . Important for negotiations . According to ISIS, the quickest route to a usable amount of weapons-grade uranium in the current circumstances could take Iran ""as little as approximately 1.0--1.6 months."" It said it updated its estimates based on the view that Iran has increased the number of centrifuges at its Fordow and Natanz plants and has begun installing a more advanced centrifuge model at Natanz. ""The shortening breakout times have implications for any negotiation with Iran,"" the report says. ""An essential finding is that they are currently too short and shortening further, based on the current trend of centrifuge deployments."" The U.S. government has said it believes Iran is about a year away from a nuclear weapon -- a more advanced stage than the one the ISIS report is forecasting. ISIS says that its estimates don't factor in the time Iran would need to convert enriched uranium into weapons components and to build a nuclear missile. ""This extra time could be substantial, particularly if Iran wanted to build a reliable warhead for a ballistic missile,"" the report says. ""However, these preparations would most likely be conducted at secret sites and would be difficult to detect."" Iran would face considerable hurdles to manufacturing a viable weapon without alerting International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. The inspectors frequently visit Iran's declared nuclear stockpiles -- sometimes with less than two hours' notice -- and check that Iranians are not carrying out other enrichment activities or diverting nuclear material, Joshi said. ""So if Iran was trying to bust the rules, it would not in two hours be able to conceal what it had been doing,"" he said. Iranian officials optimistic after Geneva talks . Painful sanctions . Iran, whose economy is suffering severely under the U.S. and U.N. sanctions imposed because of its nuclear program, has long maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only. But amid a tentative thaw in relations between Tehran and Washington since Iranian President Hassan Rouhani took office in August, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged the world community to be skeptical of Rouhani, calling him ""a sheep in wolf's clothing."" And members from both parties in the U.S. Congress have urged the Obama administration not to prematurely loosen any of the sanctions on Iran's economy. Senior congressional staff members met Thursday with White House officials over Iran. ""Congress has been an important partner in our efforts thus far,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a National Security Council spokeswoman. ""We will continue our close consultation, as we have in the past, so that any congressional action is aligned with our negotiating strategy as we move forward."" Iran nuclear talks . The next round of talks between Iran and the P5+1 is scheduled to take place next month in Geneva. A statement after the previous round, last week, described the talks as ""substantive and forward-looking."" The tone of the negotiations appeared to signal a shift, a departure from the diplomatic standoff that prevailed under former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But details on the substance of the talks were scarce. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said this week that the United States will not let up its pressure on Tehran, despite the recent diplomatic overtures between the two countries. ""We will pursue a diplomatic initiative with eyes wide open, aware it will be vital for Iran to live up to those standards other nations that have nuclear programs live up to as they prove those programs are indeed peaceful,"" he said in Rome during a meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu. ""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" Kerry said, echoing comments from Netanyahu. ""But if this can be solved satisfactorily, diplomatically, it is clearly better for everyone."" Netanyahu, who has said Iran's nuclear program poses an existential threat to Israel, has listed a series of measures he says Tehran needs to undertake, including a prohibition on centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium to a weapons-grade level. Tensions over U.S. policy on Iran have emerged with another regional ally, Saudi Arabia. The Sunni nation is wary of any rise in influence by the Shiite theocracy of Iran across the Middle East and has pushed behind the scenes for greater U.S. involvement in Syria, whose President, Bashar al-Assad, is propped up by the regime in Tehran.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's parliament voted Tuesday to impeach Interior Minister Ali Kordan for listing a fake doctorate degree on his resume. Ali Kordan said someone duped him by saying he could earn the degree by writing an article. The vote unfolded amid political intrigue, with some analysts suggesting that opponents of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are trying to trigger a vote of confidence in the government by impeaching the interior minister. In a lengthy speech during the impeachment debate Tuesday morning, Kordan suggested the Israeli news media had organized the campaign to discredit him. He claimed he did not realize that his purported Ph. D. from England's Oxford University was not real. He also said someone duped him by saying he could earn the degree by writing an article. There were 188 votes for impeachment, 45 against and 14 abstentions. Ahmadinejad, who promoted Kordan to be the interior minister in August, has backed him, calling the impeachment illegal. He told Iran's Fars News Agency that his minister's educational credentials should not make a difference. ""I do not care for a torn up piece of paper (degree). What I care about is my ministers' job performance and experience,"" Ahmadinejad said. Ahmadinejad's representative was banned from the parliament amid allegations that he tried to bribe some members and forged others' signatures on a petition that said they had withdrawn their support for the impeachment. Ahmadinejad then fired his representative. Although it is difficult to confirm details of political machinations in Tehran, some have suggested that Ahmadinejad's opponents were using the impeachment in a strategy to destabilize Ahmadinejad's administration ahead of June's presidential election. If Kordan resigns, he will be the 10th minister in Ahmadinejad's cabinet to leave the government for various reasons. Kordan is considered a close ally of Iran's parliament speaker, Ali Larijani. He served as his deputy when Larijani was the head of IRIB, Iran's national broadcasting company. Ahmadinejad's term is up next year, but he is expected to seek another four years in office in the June election. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr in Tehran contributed to this report.","Iranian interior minister impeached for listing fake doctorate degree on resume .

"(CNN) -- While the Bible Belt is known for its devotion to traditional values, Southerners don't do so well on one key family value: They are more likely to get divorced than people living in the Northeast. Southern men and women had higher rates of divorce in 2009 than their counterparts in other parts of the country: 10.2 per 1,000 for men and 11.1 per 1,000 for women, according to a new report from the U.S. Census Bureau released Thursday. By comparison, men and women in the Northeast had the lowest rates of divorce, 7.2 and 7.5 per 1,000, which is also lower than the national divorce rate of 9.2 for men and 9.7 for women. ""In the South, there are higher rates of marriage and higher rates of divorce for men and women,"" said Diana Elliott, a family demographer with the U.S. Census Bureau and co-author of the new report. ""In the Northeast, you have people who are delaying first marriages, and consequently there are lower rates of marriage and lower rates of divorce."" Of the 14 states reporting divorce rates for men that were much higher than the U.S. average -- ranging from 10.0 to 13.5 per 1,000 -- most were in the South. They included Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. In contrast, men in the Northeast divorced less than the national average. Five of the nine states that had divorce rates for men significantly below the U.S. average -- ranging from 6.1 to 8.5 -- were the Northeastern states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey , New York and Pennsylvania. The same was true for Southern women. Nine of the 14 states with divorce rates for women above the U.S. average, ranging from 10.7 to 16.2, were in the South. They included Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. By comparison, four of the 10 states with below-average divorce rates for women, ranging from 6.0 to 8.9, were in the Northeast: Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. A divorced mother of two who grew up in Virginia and is now living in the Atlanta area, Lynn (not her real name) said she knows why her eight-year marriage failed. She and her ex-husband got married after a whirlwind three-month courtship, and she now knows, ""You really don't know somebody after three months."" She didn't have a college degree when she got married, although she did eventually graduate from college and is now a teacher. Lynn said she can see some reasons that Southerners divorce at higher rates than the nation as a whole. ""Where I grew up in Virginia, I saw some of my peers not finishing high school, some not going to college and some not finishing college,"" she said. ""I saw a lot of people just staying in my hometown, staying in dead-end jobs, just settling, taking very little risk-taking for their careers."" Youth and lack of education can lead to higher divorce rates, said D'Vera Cohn, a senior writer with the Pew Research Center, who wrote a report on ""The States of Marriage and Divorce."" There's also an interactive map on the website. ""There tend to be higher divorce rates in states where women marry young,"" Cohn said. ""Education also may play a role. In general, less educated women marry at younger ages than college-educated women, and less educated couples have higher divorce rates."" Values about premarital sex associated with the Bible Belt and rural America may be encouraging people to marry early, at ages when they are likely to have less education and less income to support a long-lasting marriage, according to Naomi Cahn, law professor at The George Washington University Law School and co-author of ""Red Families v. Blue Families: Legal Polarization and the Creation of Culture."" ""There's a moral crisis in red states that's produced by higher divorce rates and the disparity between parental values and behavior of young adults,"" said Cahn. ""There is enormous tension between moral values and actual practices."" Lawrenceville, New Jersey, resident Jennifer DeBord, a married mother of two girls, made many decisions that could keep her 13-year marriage strong. She finished college, explored different careers, dated a few different men and lived with one boyfriend before figuring out what she wanted in a mate. DeBord and her husband, Jason, who works as a Broadway conductor and musician, both moved to New York City to pursue their careers in the arts. ""Waiting allowed me to find the person who was right for me, not the person who was available,"" said DeBord, 42. ""In my mother's time, you married the first person you spent time with. I would have divorced that guy. I had a much better idea of who I was (when I married) at 29 versus who I was at 19."" It's ironic that pressure on people to get married early also puts them at higher risk of divorce, said Stephanie Coontz, history and family studies professor at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, director of research and public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, and author of ""Marriage, A History: How Love Conquered Marriage"" and other books. ""The very fact that people feel less pressure to get married (in the Northeast) means they can be more selective about who they marry and take their time, "" Coontz said. ""They don't have to rush into it to please parents or avoid stigma of premarital sex."" Whatever the reasons for the South's higher divorce rate, Christian author Jonathan Merritt said that church leaders are focusing more on divorce recovery when they should be focusing on preventing divorce. ""The faith community has a twofold responsibility regarding divorce: We need to respond to the divorce epidemic among our own ranks and we need to address the trend among the broader culture,"" said Merritt, author of ""Green Like God: Unlocking the Divine Plan for Our Planet,"" who also ministers at Cross Pointe Church in Duluth, Georgia. ""Marriages and families within faith communities are no healthier than in the rest of society. Faith communities must provide support systems to salvage damaged marriages and resurrect dead marriages."" Meanwhile, divorce still pushes more women into poverty than men and affects their children, since children are still more likely to live with their mothers (75%) than their fathers (25%), according to the same U.S. Census report. Some other findings: . • Women divorcing in the past year were more likely than men to be in poverty (22% versus 11%). • Women divorcing in the past year had less household income than their male counterparts. Of those women, 27% had annual household incomes below $25,000, compared with 17% of divorced men. • Women who divorced in the past year were more likely to receive public assistance than men (23% versus 15%). • Children living with a parent divorcing in 2009 were more likely to live in poverty (28%) compared with other children (19%) and more likely to live in a rented home (53%) than other children (36%).","New Census Bureau report finds divorce higher in South than Northeast .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A government school in southern India has tested pupils' karate skills by running over their outstretched arms with a motorcycle. K. Devarajan, the director of elementary education in Tamil Nadu state, told CNN that the event, held recently, was organized with the consent of parents. State education authorities have now asked schools not to carry out such activities because they violate safety guidelines, which he claimed were already in place in state educational institutions. Devarajan said officers visited the school after learning about the controversial show. Newspaper pictures Tuesday showed a motorcyclist driving over the limbs of a row of schoolchildren lying with their faces down in the state's Villupuram district. It also showed smiling adults standing behind the young children. The act aimed to show the strength the students had gained from their karate classes, Devarajan said. Nobody was injured, said P. Perumalsamy, a senior state education official. The students involved were aged between six and 13, he added.","Indian schoolchildren run over by motorcycle in karate exercise .

"(CNN) -- The much-touted July 2011 date for the beginning of a withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Afghanistan, a center piece of the administration's ""AfPak"" strategy announced by President Obama in December 2009, now seems unlikely to amount to much. According to a senior U.S. administration official, there is presently ""no judgment on the scale or pace of those reductions."" Translation: Don't expect a significant drawdown of American forces in the summer of 2011. Indeed, there has been a strategic shift in the Obama administration policy towards Afghanistan -- first apparent at the Lisbon conference of NATO members in November. The headline is that the United States will maintain combat troops in Afghanistan until December 2014. And NATO will continue to have some kind of role in Afghanistan, likely advising and training units of the Afghan army, into 2015 and beyond. This shift doesn't seem to have registered much as yet with the American people, a record 60% of whom are now opposed to the Afghan War, according to a Washington Post poll. Indeed, in his brief remarks on Thursday about the Afghan-Pakistan strategy review, the president did not mention the fact that American troops will remain in Afghanistan until the end of 2014, likely in substantial numbers. According to a wide range of U.S. military and civilian officials and Afghan politicians interviewed in Afghanistan over the past few days, the 2014 withdrawal date is a potential game-changer, allowing time for the build-up of a more effective Afghan army, while disappointing Taliban leaders who had been assuring their fighters that the Americans would be withdrawing in mid-2011. The 2014 date also signals to the Pakistanis that the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan is a long-term one and they might as well end their tolerance or support for the Taliban and its allies headquartered on their territory. The good news in the review for the U.S. government is that parts of the Taliban heartland in central Helmand and Kandahar province have been reclaimed from the insurgents. One U.S. official says that a surge of Special Operations Forces raids against the Taliban have been devastating to the ""middle management"" of the group and ""literally hundreds have been taken off the battlefield."" The calculus is that the more pressure that is placed on the Taliban militarily the more that they might consider suing for peace. However, the Taliban leadership has repeatedly and publicly said that they are not in any form of peace negotiations with the Afghan government and there isn't evidence that contradicts this. Further positive news in the review is that Kabul, where around 15% of the Afghan population lives, is safer than for a very long time. A U.S. official points out that in past months ""Kabul has been remarkably quiet."" Certainly, Kabul's streets are more clogged with traffic than ever and Kabul residents say they feel safer. The White House also asserts that ""Al Qaeda's senior leadership in Pakistan is weaker and under more sustained pressure than at any other point since it fled Afghanistan in 2001."" That point is borne out by a count by the New America Foundation of reported U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan which found that five al-Qaeda leaders were killed by drones in 2010 and six the year before. Another positive development the administration cites is that the Afghan National Army is growing rapidly, and has met its recruitment goals three months earlier than expected. At the Kabul base that trains around half of the Afghan army recruits, Afghan officers said last week that they are churning out 2,800 graduates a month. That said, it's not possible to think of a single significant operation the Afghan army has conducted without American support. The bad news according to administration officials is that while the Pakistani military has been aggressive against al Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban groups that have attacked the Pakistani state, no action has been taken against other militant groups based in Pakistan such as the Quetta shura, which is headed by Taliban leader Mullah Omar, and coordinates attacks against U.S. and NATO forces in southern Afghanistan. Nor has there been any action taken against the Haqqani network, which is behind most of the attacks on coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan, nor against two smaller Pakistan-based Taliban militias: Hizb-i-Islami and one led by Commander Nazir. Indeed, an administration official says ""some of the evidence swings the other way -- active support and at least tolerance"" by the Pakistanis for a number of the Taliban factions. This is the paradox of Pakistan, which a U.S. official characterizes as ""both our closest counterterrorism partner and a base for terrorist groups that threaten the region and even the homeland."" Administration officials explain that in ""coming months"" the United States will negotiate with the Afghan government to extend American commitments to Afghanistan well beyond 2014. That commitment could take the minimalist form of a simple political statement that the U.S. will be in Afghanistan for the long term, or it could take a maximalist form -- a defense treaty on the model of the one the United States has with South Korea, a model that is frequently cited admiringly by Afghan officials. Or it could be something in between those positions, such as a Status of Forces Agreement of the kind that the United States signed with Iraq in 2008, which is legally binding but does not require the two-thirds majority in the U.S. Senate that is necessary for the ratification of a full-blown treaty. That agreement allowed U.S. forces to remain in Iraq in an advisory role but not in combat operations. A U.S. official says that such a long-term pact will ""speak to the Afghans, speak to the Pakistanis and indirectly to the Taliban: You can't wait us out here."" Whatever form this new commitment takes, it's obvious that the Obama administration is in Afghanistan for the long haul.","Bergen says there has been a strategic shift in the Obama administration policy towards Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- For all her experience and accomplishments, the Senate confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor could hinge on one sentence she uttered more than seven years ago. Sonia Sotomayor's opponents are attacking a 2001 remark she made at the University of California, Berkeley. The sentence constitutes 32 words of the almost 4,000 she delivered during a speech at the University of California, Berkeley. Read by itself, it seems to imply that Latina women make better judges than white men. ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life,"" she said October 26, 2001. The Princeton and Yale graduate has more than 16 years of federal opinions with which to gauge her proficiency as an arbiter. She spent six years as a district judge and a decade on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but the 2001 comment promises to be a focal point of her confirmation.  See Sotomayor's key rulings » . Conservatives such as talk radio host Rush Limbaugh have called her a ""reverse racist."" Limbaugh further denounced President Obama as ""the greatest living example of a reverse racist."" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote in a Twitter post Wednesday, ""White man racist nominee would be forced to withdraw. Latina woman racist should also withdraw."" However, the White House and others say the remark is being taken out of context.  Watch GOP congressman say she'll get a fair hearing » . ""Look at the totality of it. I have confidence that people will come to a reasonable conclusion,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in his Wednesday briefing. When Obama cited the qualities he was seeking in a nominee, a diverse background was atop the list, Gibbs said. ""When I talk about the richness of experience, I include a life and an upbringing that are different than some people have had,"" Gibbs said. Indeed, in a 2007 speech to a Planned Parenthood convention, the president laid out the criteria he would use to select judges: ""We need somebody who's got the heart -- the empathy -- to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom, the empathy to understand what it's like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old.""  See whom Sotomayor would sit alongside if she's confirmed » . Sotomayor's 2001 speech had similar overtones, as she conceded that white justices had made historic decisions on race and gender but emphasized that the attorneys who argued these decisions before the court were African-Americans and women. At the beginning of her speech, she offered all Latinos in the room a warning: ""Latinas are making a lot of progress in the old-boy network."" She went on to laud her Latina upbringing and culture before delivering a brief history on the ascension of women and minorities to the federal bench. She referenced ""two excellent studies on how women on the courts of appeal and state supreme courts have tended to vote more often than their male counterpart to uphold women's claims in sex discrimination cases and criminal defendants' claims in search and seizure cases."" After making the now-inflammatory comment on Latina women versus white men, she discussed how her experiences might color her judicial decisions.  Watch how Sotomayor can smooth confirmation process » . ""Personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see,"" she said. ""My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging. But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage."" Read a transcript of the speech . Lani Guinier, a professor at Harvard Law School, defended Sotomayor's remarks, writing in The New York Times on Tuesday that ""cognitive psychology and history predict that every justice acts from a perspective."" As a judge, litigator and private lawyer, Sotomayor has myriad experiences that will benefit the court, Guinier wrote, but it would be a mistake to reduce Sotomayor to her résumé.  Watch bloggers share their thoughts » . ""[Her] impressive intellect is joined by the wisdom and compassion that comes from varied life experiences,"" Guinier wrote. Maria Echaveste, President Clinton's former deputy chief of staff, also defended Sotomayor. Calling Sotomayor a racist, she said, is a disservice to the public. ""What is wisdom but knowledge and experience -- and experience that comes from being who you are? That's all she was saying,"" she said. Asked whether she would defend a white male nominee who said his experience gave him a better perspective on legal issues, Echaveste dismissed the comparison. ""I can't imagine that any president would pick someone who would say something like that. That's not what Judge Sotomayor was saying,"" she replied. Several conservatives, however, believe that is exactly what Sotomayor was saying, and they have mounted an offensive before her confirmation schedule is even solidified. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has called her nomination ""troubling"" and said her public remarks ""make it clear she has an expansive view of the role of the judiciary."" ""What the American public deserves is a judge who will put the law above her own personal political philosophy,"" he said in a statement. Another 2008 GOP presidential hopeful, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, also lambasted Sotomayor, saying Obama's campaign promise to remain centrist and bipartisan is ""mere rhetoric."" ""The notion that appellate court decisions are to be interpreted by the 'feelings' of the judge is a direct affront of the basic premise of our judicial system that is supposed to apply the law without personal emotion,"" Huckabee said in a statement. ""If she is confirmed, then we need to take the blindfold off Lady Justice."" Despite widespread criticism over Sotomayor's remark, those defending her say they hope the Senate will judge her by her qualifications and not her 2001 Berkeley speech. ""America is a big, rich, diverse pot, and having a woman of her caliber, her qualifications, on the bench can only enrich,"" Echaveste said. Added the White House's Gibbs, ""I think [richness of experience] provides somebody with important perspective, and I think many people in America can see some part of them in her story."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and John King contributed to this report.","White House says 2001 remark being taken out of context .

"(CNN)Silicon Valley was once the only place to be for the world's hippest tech firms. It's the region that gave birth to all-conquering behemoths like Google and Apple, after all. But fast forward to 2015 and the playground of global technology has moved roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) north to San Francisco. ""Information is the new currency and that currency is gushing through the streets of San Francisco,"" said Alan Collenette, regional managing director of real estate firm Colliers International. According to Collenette, firms like Twitter are relocating to the City by the Bay because it offers a more attractive lifestyle to talented employees. ""If you're in your 20s (or) 30s, you want to live in a vibrant environment where you're surrounded by like-minded people. Where there's a lot of interesting cultural stuff to do,"" Collenette said. ""And with the great respect to the suburbs where Apple was born, there's a lot more cultural diversity and a lot more to do (in San Francisco) than there is there. Last year, commercial real estate in San Francisco was snapped up in large parcels. As many as 14 different companies signed leases for more than 9,000 square meters (97,000 square feet) worth of space and property. Among those leasing were tech heavyweights like Pinterest and Trulia. ""Now in 2015, 60% of all leases done in San Francisco are for technology companies,"" Collenette said. ""28% of the top space users who occupy more than 250, 000 square feet are technology users. That's up from 8% in the dotcom boom. That's how dramatic the shift's been."" These cash-rich tech firms are also changing the game by shying away from the offices of yesterday. Beer taps, foosball tables, and bike racks are now the norm at offices in the city. Primo Orpilla has seen the change first hand while designing spaces for the likes of crowd-sourced company review platform, Yelp, and taxi app, Uber. ""The offices of just three or four years ago, they're definitely more hierarchically set up,"" Orpilla said. ""You had fewer conference rooms, a lot of the work stations went to the middle. What we're seeing now, we're basically wanting to share that space. Share the light, flatten the organization."" Orpilla adds that old warehouses with high ceilings in the South of Market District have become particularly popular. But demand has driven prices up with rates climbing for both commercial and residential properties. In a city that spans just seven by seven square miles space will eventually run out. For now though, the outlook is rosy for those riding the tech wave. ""There has never been a time when the world's economy depended so much on the ideas and the work product that come out of one location,"" said Collenette. ""It's the golden age, this is an era that's just beginning and the light isn't just shining on San Francisco for a brief moment in time. I firmly believe this is going to last long into the future.""","Some of the world's biggest tech firms are moving into San Francisco .

"The strongest typhoon to hit southern China in four decades has killed at least 16 people in the region after leaving scores dead in the Philippines. Strong winds and rain from Super Typhoon Rammasun hit dozens of southern coastal cities in the provinces of Guangdong and Hainan and the region of Guangxi, affecting more than 3 million people, the Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported Saturday. The powerful storm made landfall on the island province of Hainan about 1:30 p.m. Friday after veering west, according to the China Meteorological Administration. Planes were grounded in Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, stranding 1,300 passengers, Xinhua said, and train service between Nanning and coastal cities was suspended. Rammasun struck the Philippines earlier in the week, killing at least 94 people and displacing more than half a million, according to the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Most of the victims died after being hit by falling trees, collapsed structures or flying debris. Others drowned or were killed in landslides, the Philippines News Agency reported. The typhoon, known locally as ""Glenda,"" made landfall near Legazpi City on the country's east coast late Tuesday and barreled past the capital Manila. After weakening during its passage across the Philippines, the storm gained strength again over the South China Sea, rising rapidly from a Category 1 storm to a Category 5, as it made its way to China.","At least 16 people are dead, thousands of structures destroyed .

"(CNN) -- Even as much of Haiti struggles to recover from last year's devastating earthquake, scientists have found some survivors who are coming back from the edge. Hopping back from the edge, to be precise. An expedition by a conservation team searching for frogs in Haiti's dwindling forests has turned up six species not seen by scientists in more than two decades. The species ranged from a tiny frog smaller than a coin, to a whistling frog named after Mozart to a hard-to-track frog that has the ability to 'throw' its voice like a ventriloquist to fool predators. ""It was incredible"", said expedition leader Robin Moore in a press release. ""We went in looking for one missing species and found a treasure trove of others. That, to me, represents a welcome dose of resilience and hope for the people and wildlife of Haiti."" Expedition sponsor Conservation International says that population pressures and environmental degradation have left the island nation with only a tiny percentage of its original pristine forests. ""A common assumption about Haiti is that there is nothing left to save"", said Moore, an amphibian conservation researcher who has been to the island three times. ""That is not entirely true. There are biologically rich pockets intact, despite tremendous environmental pressures. Haiti now has the opportunity to design their reconstruction plans around these pockets, and grow them, so they can more effectively act as natural buffers to climate change and natural disasters."" Moore spent just over a week in the southern Haitian cloud forests, searching through the trees, creeks, and bushes for frogs and other amphibians. In the end, they were able to find examples of just over half of the 49 known frog species in Haiti. That gives them hope that there are more out there, and that part of the overall recovery for the nation needs to include conserving its natural habitats. ""Finding six lost species in these relatively small corners of the country tells us that, despite tremendous human pressures, nature is hanging on in Haiti,"" said Moore. ""There is reason to hope. Managed properly, these species and ecosystems can become a source of natural wealth and national pride for the country, that we hope will offer long-term benefits for its people.""","A conservation expedition in Haiti turned up frog species not seen in more than two decades .

"(CNN) -- A shark attack Friday killed a 19-year-old college student off a beach on Vandenberg Air Force Base, said authorities in Santa Barbara County, California. A shark, described as being 14 to 20 feet in length, bit off the left leg of Lucas McKaine Ransom of Romoland, California, while he was Boogie Boarding with a 20-year-old male friend, said a spokesman with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department. Ransom was a junior at University of California at Santa Barbara. He was majoring in chemical engineering. On Friday morning, Ransom was riding the waves at Surf Beach about 100 yards offshore when a shark pulled him under the water, authorities said. His friend and other witnesses pulled him from the water, authorities said. Authorities released a photograph of the Boogie Board, showing a 13-inch bite mark. Air base fire personnel pronounced Ransom dead at the scene. Federal and state fish and game officials are trying to identify the type of shark. Surf Beach is one of three that sit on the coastal military base, and officials closed all three beaches at 9:46 a.m. Pacific (12:46 p.m. ET), shortly after the shark attack, an air base spokesman said. ""Our first responders were on scene to assist in rescue efforts,"" Col. Richard Boltz, 30th Space Wing commander, said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends."" The three beaches will remain closed for 72 hours, the spokesman said. Surf Beach is open to the public, but the other two -- Wall and Minuteman beaches -- are open to base personnel only, the spokesman said. The Santa Barbara County Parks Department is posting warning signs at beaches in the Jalama and Guadalupe beach areas, authorities said.","NEW: Authorities release photos of shark bite mark on Boogie Board .

"BENTON HARBOR, Michigan (CNN)  -- Former President George W. Bush on Thursday repeated Dick Cheney's assertion that the administration's enhanced interrogation program, which included controversial techniques such as waterboarding, was legal and garnered valuable information that prevented terrorist attacks. Former President George W. Bush defended his administration in speech Thursday in Michigan. Bush told a southwestern Michigan audience of nearly 2,500 -- the largest he has addressed in the United States since leaving the White House in January -- that, after the September 11 attacks, ""I vowed to take whatever steps that were necessary to protect you."" In his speech, Bush did not specifically refer to the high-profile debate over President Obama's decision to halt the use of harsh interrogation techniques. Bush also didn't mention Cheney, his former vice president, by name. Instead, he described how he proceeded after the capture of terrorism suspect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in March 2003. ""The first thing you do is ask what's legal?"" Bush said. ""What do the lawyers say is possible? I made the decision, within the law, to get information so I can say to myself, 'I've done what it takes to do my duty to protect the American people.' I can tell you that the information we got saved lives."" Bush avoided the sharp tone favored by Cheney in recent weeks and stressed he does not want to disparage Obama. ""Nothing I am saying is meant to criticize my successor,"" Bush said. ""There are plenty of people who have weighed in. Trust me, having seen it first-hand. I didn't like it when a former president criticized me, so therefore I am not going to criticize my successor. I wish him all the best."" The former president was speaking to the Economic Club of Southwestern Michigan. In a change in format, he agreed to answer questions directly from the audience instead of responding to pre-submitted questions provided to a moderator. He repeated his disclaimer about not passing judgment on Obama later when asked about North Korea's nuclear test. Before answering, the 43rd president said he is ""in no way trying to shape my successor's decisions or criticize them."" ""I know there are news people here, and they love conflict,"" he said. Bush then went on to say that diplomacy is impossible without leverage. ""A lot of times people want to give out the carrots,"" he said. ""My attitude is, you give out the carrots when the behavior changes."" After his opening remarks, Bush engaged in a nearly hour-long back-and-forth with audience members that touched on nearly all aspects of his presidency, from the September 11 attacks to his ban on embryonic stem cell research, to his consultations with advisers as the economic crisis hit last year. He strongly defended his Troubled Asset Relief Program in response to the economic crisis at the end of his presidency, calling it crucial to preventing capital markets from freezing up, which he said would have led to another Great Depression. However, he said he remains ""a free-market guy."" Asked what he thinks about conservative pundits who say the Obama administration's fiscal policies are opening the door to socialism, Bush said: ""I think the verdict is out. I think people are waiting to see what all this means."" The former president received a noisy standing ovation when answering a question about what he wants his legacy to be. ""Well, I hope it is this: The man showed up with a set of principles, and he was unwilling to compromise his soul for the sake of popularity,"" he said. He also revealed the topic of the first chapter in his forthcoming book, which he said will be about ""the stories of my administration, as I saw them."" That first chapter, he said, will answer the question: ""Why did I run for president?""","George W. Bush delivers first major domestic speech since leaving White House .

"(CNN) -- A blind Michigan man, rejected by three law schools after scoring poorly on the Law School Admission Test, is suing the American Bar Association, arguing that the group's exam requirements discriminate against the visually impaired. In a suit filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Angelo Binno alleges the Chicago-based ABA prevents law schools from waiving the admission test, known as the LSAT, for blind applicants. The suit alleges that visually impaired students face considerable difficulties with visually-oriented parts of the exam. The association's rules require students to take a ""valid and reliable'' test. Binno's lawsuit counters that the LSAT is the only widely used, commercially available exam for assessing law school applicants, leaving, in effect, no alternative. The suit says according to ABA policy, schools could face sanctions, be put on probation, or lose accreditation if they fail to comply. Binno says this violates protections for the disabled provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. ""I want to help disabled and disadvantaged people who otherwise would struggle to have their voices be heard,"" Binno said. A spokesperson for the ABA said its lawyers have not yet seen the lawsuit, nor been served with documentation, and the association could not comment at this time. The Law School Admissions Council, a private not-for-profit group based in Newtown, Pennsylvania, administers more than 100,000 LSATs annually, according to its website. Before 1997, law schools could decide whether blind people must take the exam, according to Binno's lawyer, Richard Bernstein, who is also blind. The LSAT was waived for Bernstein in 1995. He graduated from Northwestern University School of Law in 1999. The litigation focuses on the analytical reasoning or so-called logic games section of the test, which requires ''spatial reasoning and diagramming of visual concepts for successful completion by most applicants,'' according to the suit. The complaint includes a copy of logic games from an LSAT given in 2007. The directions atop the section of the test say ''it may be useful to draw a rough diagram'' in figuring out the answers to some questions. ""It's a situation where blind or visually impaired people can't interpret a diagram since they don't have spatial perceptions,'' Bernstein said. ""So how is it fair to require that type of question to get into law school? At the end of the day, blind people can't draw.'' According to Binno's lawsuit, ''being unable to competitively answer questions on a quarter of the exam causes plaintiff substantial embarrassment, emotional distress, and mental anguish during the exam, which adversely impacts his overall performance.'' Binno, who is not suing for monetary damages but retains the right to do so, wants the ABA to change its policies on blind applicants and the LSAT. ""I want the American Bar Association to stop telling blind people that they have to draw pictures in order to go to law school,"" Binno said. Binno, 28, is fluent in three languages, finished high school in three years, graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit and worked with a unit of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security with a high-level security clearance handling applications and credentials of immigrants, according to the lawsuit. He was laid off in 2008 and has focused on getting into law school for the past three years. Binno is blind from birth with a condition called retinitis pigmentosa. ""We're fighting so we can have more disabled attorneys who are going to create more disabled rights,'' said Bernstein, who teaches social justice at the University of Michigan, and said he runs marathons and has completed an Iron Man triathlon.","Angelo Binno of Michigan is blind, and he aspires to go to law school .

"Anat Hoffman had no idea who comedian Sarah Silverman was until Silverman's sister and niece were detained with her Sunday in Jerusalem for wearing prayer shawls as they prayed at the Western Wall. Police detained 10 women for ""performing a religious act contrary to the local customs."" The group of women, who call themselves the Women of the Wall, went to pray in Jewish shawls known as tallitot that Israeli law says only Jewish men can wear there. ""There are lots of forbidden acts at the Western Wall: Do not spit on the wall, do not pee on the wall, no slaughtering of animals at the wall, and among those one cannot perform a religious act contrary to local customs at the wall, which pretty much only applies to women because there are no local customs men are forbidden from taking part in,"" Hoffman said. She heads the Women of the Wall group and was a city councilwoman for 14 years. Women of the Wall says it wants equal access for all Jewish practices and denominations at the holiest site for prayer in Judaism. About 100 women, including Hoffman and Susan Silverman, who is a Reform rabbi, went to the wall property to pray for Adar, the 12th month of the Jewish year, and 10 of them went down to the Western Wall itself. They were detained as they were leaving the premises after they prayed. ""There is a designated place where they can wear the shawl on the property of the Western Wall but not at the wall itself,"" Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN. ""Ten of the 100 women with the group came and prayed at the Western Wall. They were detained and released after a couple of hours and given a warning they have to stay away from the wall for 15 days. We take our orders from a High Court decision. Until there is another decision or change, those are our clear orders."" In 2003, Israel's High Court said the women could pray and read from the Torah while wearing the shawls at a different location on the property near the wall, but it did allow them at the Western Wall itself, the organization's attorney said. When Sarah Silverman heard what her sister and the other women were detained for, she was quick to respond with a tweet that said: . ""So proud of my amazing sister and niece for their balls out civil disobedience. Ur the tits!"" Comedian Silverman's representatives sent this response to the incident to CNN: . ""I don't care much for people who use religion as a cloak to justify hatred, injustice and fear. And I can't imagine God, should He or She or It exist, does either. I am so proud of my sister and niece for fighting for what they believe in -- by having the nerve to pray at a Wall of prayer while being female."" Women are allowed to pray at the Western Wall. The 10 women were detained Sunday for wearing the shawls. Women of the Wall members have gone to the wall wearing prayer shawls for 24 years. But the organizers said it was just in the past 22 months that police have detained or arrested them. For years, the women say, ushers who work at the wall, not police, were the ones who moved them away. Over the past 22 months, they said, one woman has been arrested and more than 40 detained. Hoffman said she was the one arrested. She said she was handcuffed at the hands and feet when she was taken to jail last year and spent 24 hours there. She refused to sign a police declaration that said she was guilty of breaking the law, and she did not agree to refrain from such actions again. ""It was 24 hours of hell,"" she said. This time around, she and the other women were only held at the police station, not taken to jail. But this won't be the last time they try to do what they think they should be allowed to do at the Western Wall. Hoffman said that at first, she didn't know that a famous U.S. comedian's sister was part of the group. ""I had no idea who Sarah Silverman was, but I do now. She is one funny woman. I had no idea they'd let a woman talk like that in the U.S."" she said as she laughed.","10 women were detained for ""performing a religious act contrary to the local customs""

"(CNN) -- It sounds far too good to be true: a salary of more than $100,000, a free home on a palm-fringed island and all the snorkeling you can be bothered with. The successful applicant will have plenty of time to explore the Great Barrier Reef. However, it is true and a very clever marketing ploy to boot. Australia's Tourism Queensland has garnered worldwide media coverage by advertising the ""best job in the world"" -- the post of caretaker on Hamilton island in the Great Barrier Reef. The six-month contract, according to Tourism Queensland, comes with flexible working hours and the successful applicant's ""key responsibilities"" include exploring the area to discover what is on offer and to report back weekly via blogs, photo diaries, video updates and media interviews. Sounds taxing doesn't it? The group said other responsibilities would include cleaning the pool, which comes with your free home, feeding the fish and collecting the mail (this would be done by joining the aerial postal service for a day or two to get a good view of the neighboring islands). You might also take time out from your busy schedule to check out the turtles and passing whales. On top of the six-figure salary you'll get return airfares from your nearest capital city, transport on the island, travel insurance, computer and camera gear and travel to other islands in the Great Barrier Reef. No academic qualifications are required but you must be a good swimmer and enjoy snorkeling, be adventurous and have good communication skills. Where do I sign up I hear you ask? Tourism Queensland is asking for a 60-second video explanation of why you'd be great for the job and that you fill out their online application form at www.islandreefjob.com .

"(CNN) -- India has been certified polio-free by the World Health Organization after going three years without an endemic case of polio. The eradication of polio in India is heralded as one of the biggest achievements in global health efforts. The polio-free certification by the Regional Certification Commission came Thursday, along with a proclamation that Southeast Asia is free of the disease. Just five years ago, India was home to nearly half the global polio cases and considered one of the most technically difficult places to eradicate the disease, because of sanitation challenges and high-density population. India's last case was reported in a young girl paralyzed by polio in West Bengal in January 2011. Meet the last person to have polio in India . So how did the second most populous country in the world, considered the hardest place to end polio, become free of the disease? Health workers determined that the children of migrants or those growing up in difficult-to-reach areas were not getting access to vaccines. So they deployed immunization efforts to reach the most vulnerable, according to UNICEF. India launched a massive effort involving a surveillance network and almost 2.3 million vaccine administrators, who identified communities falling through the cracks. To counter rumors and misgivings about the vaccine, social mobilizers, religious leaders and parents were included to increase understanding about immunizations. They also bolstered communication and outreach efforts that often included Bollywood celebrities and cricket players. The efforts combined government, various U.N. agencies as well as philanthropic organizations. The highly infectious viral disease primarily affects young children and could lead to paralysis and death. It can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. The incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99% since 1988. It remains endemic in three countries -- Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan -- down from more than 125 countries in 1988. Vaccinating children against polio can be a deadly job . Polio workers in those countries have been facing violence as some militant groups have begun targeting anti-polio campaigns. In December, the WHO began vaccination efforts to reach more than 23 million children across the Middle East following an outbreak of the disease in Syria.","India's last polio case reported in January 13, 2011 .

"Republican conservatives should be worried. Evangelical churches that frequently support conservative candidates are finally admitting something the rest of us have known for some time: Their young adult members are abandoning church in significant numbers and taking their voting power with them. David Kinnaman, the 38-year-old president of the Barna Group, an evangelical research firm, is the latest to sound the alarm. In his new book, ""You Lost Me: Why Young Christians Are Leaving Church and Rethinking Faith,"" he says that 18- to 29-year-olds have fallen down a ""black hole"" of church attendance. There is a 43% drop in Christian church attendance between the teen and early adult years, he says. I'm not surprised. These young dropouts value the sense of community their churches provide but are tired of being told how they should live their lives. They don't appreciate being condemned for living with a partner, straight or gay, outside of marriage or opting for abortion to terminate an unplanned pregnancy. This doesn't mean that they necessarily will vote for President Obama in 2012. Jobs and higher wages are their priority just as they are for everyone else; the nominee who convinces the millennials that they'll be better off financially will get their vote. But if neither party is persuasive, the former evangelicals may vote Democratic because of that party's more moderate stance on social issues. Or they could simply sit out the election. Brittany, a 24-year-old veterinary technician, is an example of the newly disaffected. In high school, she attended a conservative Episcopal church in northern Virginia. She enrolled in college thinking of herself as a conservative and not wanting to have sex until she was married. Her views changed when she met her boyfriend. She began to question the theology of her home church on a number of social issues. ""I know I'm a Christian and believe in God, but the church hasn't helped me in my struggles,"" she says. ""It really doesn't affect anything in life right now."" The result? ""I don't go to any church."" And how does she feel about next year's election? ""There are many times I think I'd rather not vote at all."" In lifestyle and beliefs, she is far from an outlier. Consider the following facts about millennials in general: . •  Seven in 10 millennials say sex between an unmarried man and woman is morally acceptable (PDF). (According to Kinnaman, young Christians are as sexually active as non-Christians.) •  Most women in their early 20s who give birth are unmarried. •  More than six in 10 millennials (including 49% of Republican millennials) support same-sex marriages. •  Six in 10 millennials say abortion should be legal (PDF), a higher proportion than found in the general population. A higher percentage say abortion services should be available in local communities. Millennials also part ways with conservative orthodoxy on wealth distribution and caring for the environment. According to a report in The Christian Science Monitor, three out of four say that wealthy corporations and financiers have too much power and that taxes should be raised on the very wealthy, and two out of three say financial institutions should be regulated more closely. In addition, most say that creationists' view on evolution is outdated. Sounds a lot like Democratic ideology to me. Of course, every generation rethinks its beliefs and values during young adulthood. Even the most liberal tend to moderate their views once they marry, have children and start paying a mortgage. Some of them return to church, if only for the structured support of a congregation and the moral instruction their sons and daughters can receive. But here's the thing: This particular generation is marrying later than prior generations, if they marry at all. They're having children -- and assuming a mortgage -- later. The longer they stay away from church, the less likely they are to come back. ""What used to be two or three years of dropping out is a decade or more,"" author Kinnaman said. In 2008, then-presidential contender Obama received a healthy 33% of the young white evangelical vote. If he and his team offer millennials concrete ideas for improving their dismal job situation, he could repeat or even improve upon that in 2012. So far, however, Obama and mainstream Democrats have done little to reach out to younger voters other than ease the burden of paying off college loans, a not-insignificant move. Perhaps they hold to the theory that presidential elections are the domain of the 40-plus crowd, an assumption increasingly outdated by the speed and breadth with which millennials communicate over the Internet. In a very tight race, votes cast by this generation -- which has grown in number by 4 million since the last election -- might make the difference. Their votes will be significant for sure by the end of this decade because by then, millennials will make up a third of the U.S. adult population. And that's a good thing. As the most diverse generation ever, they've shown themselves to be better than their elders at seeking areas of common ground and making compromises. They're also more optimistic: Despite the economic instability of their generation, more than two-thirds believe they can achieve success regardless of race, ethnicity or social class. All of us, whether we're churched or unchurched, could use that kind of faith.","Many young evangelicals are abandoning their churches, says Laura Sessions Stepp .
These young dropouts are tired of being told how they should live their lives, Stepp says .

"A McDonald's employee in Pittsburgh was arrested Wednesday after undercover police officers said they discovered her selling heroin in Happy Meal boxes, according to a criminal complaint. Shantia Dennis, 26, was arrested after undercover law enforcement officials conducted a drug buy, according to a statement from Mike Manko, communications director for the Allegheny County District Attorney's Office. Customers looking for heroin were instructed to go through the drive-through and say, ""I'd like to order a toy."" The customer would then be told to proceed to the first window, where they would be handed a Happy Meal box containing heroin, Manko said. During the drug buy, the undercover officers recovered 10 stamp bags of heroin inside of a Happy Meal box, according to the statement. Officers immediately arrested Dennis and recovered an additional 50 bags of heroin, as well as a small amount of marijuana, according to the complaint. The sales of heroin do not appear to be related to the potentially lethal batches of heroin being sold in Western Pennsylvania, according to the statement. Dennis is charged with two counts of possession, one count of criminal use of a communication facility, one count of prohibited acts of delivery and one count of possession with intent to deliver.

"(CNN) -- FBI agents arrested Najibullah Zazi, a 24-year-old Colorado resident and Afghan national questioned in an alleged terrorist plot in the United States. FBI agents raided Najibullah Zazi's home on Saturday and took him into custody. Zazi and his father, Mohammed Zazi, were handcuffed without incident late Saturday as authorities raided Zazi's home in the Denver suburb of Aurora, according to CNN's Jim Spellman. FBI agents in New York arrested Ahmad Wais Afzali, 37, a resident of Flushing, New York. Officials said Afzali is a legal permanent resident from Afghanistan. All three men are charged with knowingly and willingly making false statements to the FBI. Arthur Folsom, attorney for the Zazis, met with them at the FBI offices in Denver Sunday morning, said Wendy Aiello, the attorney's spokeswoman.  Watch Zazi being taken into custody » . Najibullah Zazi and Mohammed Zazi are scheduled to appear in federal court in Colorado on Monday. Afzali is scheduled to make his initial court appearance in New York on Monday. Earlier on Saturday, Najibullah Zazi, who had been questioned for the past three days by federal investigators, declined to attend a fourth day of interviews.  Watch why authorities want to talk with Zazi » . Zazi has admitted to having ties to al Qaeda, an administration official familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday. Folsom denied the allegations Friday night and said Zazi did not admit to having ties to the terror group. He also said the FBI has not made an offer. ""He never admitted going to a terrorist training camp,"" Folsom told CNN affiliate KUSA in Denver. ""Some of the information in news reports was not true,"" Folsom said. ""There have been no plea negotiations ... they (FBI) haven't made any offer."" Zazi also told The Denver Post on Saturday that he has not admitted any ties to the terrorist group. He also denied taking part in insurgency training in Pakistan or involvement in a terror plot. ""It's not true,"" Zazi said in a phone interview with the newspaper. ""I have nothing to hide. It's all media publications reporting whatever they want. They have been reporting all this nonsense."" He said he lived in Pakistan before moving to New York as a teenager. While in Pakistan, he said, he spends a lot of time with his wife. ""I was there (at her house) the whole time,"" Zazi said. The alleged terrorist plot, which came to light this week after raids in New York, may have involved a major transportation center, like a large railroad or subway station, sources close to the investigation told CNN on Thursday. There were plans for an attack, presumably in the New York area, where crowds are large and security screening for nonairport travelers is lax, the sources said. Two sources familiar with the investigation said that Zazi had video of New York's Grand Central Terminal, a massive junction of rail and subway lines, as well as shops and restaurants, which see an average of more than a half million visitors per day. A former counterterrorism official said backpacks, computers and maps were found during searches in the New York City borough of Queens, and field tests turned up positive for explosives. But such tests often yield false positives, and the former official was unaware whether more definitive test results had been obtained. On Wednesday, federal agents searched Zazi's apartment in Denver and another home in a Denver suburb in connection with the investigation. A law enforcement official told CNN that diagrams showing how to make bombs were found on the computer that Zazi had with him when he was stopped in New York during a recent visit, but Folsom has denied those allegations.","Najibullah Zazi taken into custody late Saturday .

"Saber rattling rose to new levels Monday on the Korean Peninsula as Pyongyang officials ""scrapped"" the armistice credited for nearly 60 years of uneasy peace and then failed to answer a hotline phone. ""The Korean Armistice Agreement is to be scrapped completely just from today,"" said a spokesman for the North Korean military -- the Korean People's Army Supreme Command -- according to Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party. North Korea cited the U.N. Security Council's unanimous passage Thursday of tougher sanctions against Pyongyang for carrying out missile and nuclear tests. North Korea declares 1953 armistice invalid . ""The collective sanction is precisely a declaration of war and an act of war against the DPRK,"" said the newspaper, using the initials of North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. U.S.-South Korean drills . North Korea's announcement came as military drills involving South Korea and the United States were taking place. The exercises, called Key Resolve, are in conjunction with the Foal Eagle joint exercises that began March 1 and are scheduled to last two months. More than 3,000 U.S. forces are taking part in Key Resolve, according to U.S. Forces Korea. North Korea also has called the annual training exercises ""an open declaration of a war."" ""Under the cloak of the UNSC, the U.S. seeks to realize its aggressive purpose against the DPRK by threatening its right to existence as well as its sovereignty,"" the newspaper continued. ""What is graver is the fact that the U.S. cooked up the resolution on sanction timing to coincide with the 'Key Resolve' and 'Foal Eagle' joint military exercises."" The U.N. Command notified the North Korean military on February 21 of the exercise dates, noting they are annual joint exercises defensive in nature and not related to current events on the Korean Peninsula. In his inauguration speech on Monday, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se called the security situation ""very grave,"" South Korea's government-backed Yonhap News Agency reported. ""The security situation on the Korean Peninsula for now is very grave as the unpredictability surrounding North Korea is rising following its third nuclear test,"" Yun said. ""However, my aim is to turn this era of confrontation and mistrust into an era of trust and cooperation with North Korea."" Two weeks after her inauguration, President Park Geun-hye presided over her first cabinet meeting. ""If we are going to get North Korea to give up its nuclear programs and make the right choice, what is more important than anything else is to cooperate closely with the international community,"" she said, according to Yonhap. She ordered the government to take measures to keep safe South Korean workers at a joint industrial complex in the North Korean city of Kaesong and residents on the border island of Yeonpyeong, which was targeted by the North Korean artillery in 2010, according to her spokesman, Yonhap said. In remarks delivered Monday at the Asia Society in New York, national security adviser Tom Donilon said, ""The United States will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state; nor will we stand by while it seeks to develop a nuclear-armed missile that can target the United States."" He added, ""The international community has made clear that there will be consequences for North Korea's flagrant violation of its international obligations."" Why the Korean War still matters . He announced that Park has accepted President Barack Obama's invitation to visit Washington in May. Donilon attended Park's inauguration in Seoul. ""When we met, I conveyed to President Park President Obama's unwavering commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea,"" he said. He cited ""provocations and extreme rhetoric"" from the impoverished North. ""To get the assistance it desperately needs and the respect it claims it wants, North Korea will have to change course,"" he said. ""Otherwise, the United States will continue to work with allies and partners to tighten national and international sanctions to impede North Korea's nuclear and missile programs."" Donilon cited the Treasury Department's imposition of U.S. sanctions against the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, the country's main foreign exchange bank, ""for its role in supporting"" Pyongyang's weapons of mass destruction program. ""North Korea's claims may be hyperbolic, but as to the policy of the United States, there should be no doubt: We will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and respond to, the threat posed to us and our allies by North Korea,"" he said. Concern over 'bellicose rhetoric' In Washington, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that Pyongyang's ""bellicose rhetoric"" had raised concerns. ""The DPRK will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in northeast Asia,"" he said. Also Monday, North Korea did not answer its hotline with Seoul, South Korea's Unification Ministry said, according to the Yonhap news agency. The ministry said the North did not answer two attempts to communicate by telephone at 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. local time. The military hotline was set up in 2004 with the goal of easing tensions along the heavily fortified border between South and North, the world's last Cold War frontier. What's in a threat? A look at North Korea's escalating rhetoric -- and actions . Last week, Pyongyang said it planned to terminate its military telephone line with the United States. But Andre Kok, deputy public affairs officer for U.S. Forces in Korea, said reports that the North's Korean People's Army, known as the KPA, cut off communication often arise when military training exercises are taking place. ""When we place a call on the direct phone line and the KPA does not answer, we have no way of knowing if the KPA has actually disconnected the phone lines or are just not answering the phone,"" he said. North Korea's nuclear warning . North Korea had previously warned it could carry out strikes against the United States and South Korea. But analysts say North Korea is years away from having the technology needed to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile and aim it accurately at a target. And, analysts say, North Korea is unlikely to seek a direct military conflict with the United States, preferring instead to try to gain traction through threats and the buildup of its military deterrent. Its problems are also internal: a U.N. Human Rights Council report dated February 1 cited ""grave, systematic and widespread violations of human rights"" in the country. The Koreas are still technically at war because the 1950-53 war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. In 2002, then-U.S. President George W. Bush labeled Pyongyang part of an ""axis of evil"" with Iraq and Iran. Beyond the DMZ: Tweeting from North Korea .","White House: ""The DPRK will achieve nothing by threats or provocations""

"QUINCY, Massachusetts (CNN) -- When Warren Lewis played ice hockey for the Boston College Eagles, they won the national title. ""You never get in the game unless you intend to win it,"" he says. Members of the Quincy Bald Eagles hockey team watch the action on the ice. At age 80, Lewis' team now is the the Quincy Bald Eagles, a group of senior players who meet three times a week at a local ice arena outside Boston, Massachusetts. ""Kids love to play it,"" he continues, ""and so do old guys, even though it's slow-motion hockey."" Out of the 60 players on the roster, five are in their 80s and 23 are in their 70s. The rest are in their 60s. A few players in their 50s are allowed to fill occasional gaps. Three times a week, they meet at the Quincy Youth Arena and divide up into two teams, one wearing black jerseys, the other white. The skills range between those like Lewis, who played in college, to pond hockey players, to those who only started playing in recent years. ""What's unique about our group,"" says Bill ""Bibby"" Lewis, ""is that people are over seventy years of age still skating. A lot of people our age can't even walk."" Bibby started the group 16 years ago as a way for players to continue after getting a little too old for other hockey leagues. He says it has gone from five players to 60 in that time. In addition to their inter-group games, the Bald Eagles have competed nationally in tournaments for players 70 years and up. It's a non-checking play of hockey, which means they don't hit. ""If they do, it's really accidental,"" says player Dick Lyons. ""If one of us falls,"" jokes Wayne Gauthier, ""it takes two or three of us to pick each other up.""  Watch the Bald Eagles in action » . In the 16 years of the Bald Eagles' existence, Lyons says, there may have been one or two skirmishes. ""We can't hit very hard,"" he adds. Some cruise the ice with skill and handle the puck with precision, while the pace of other teammates might be a bit sluggish. No matter how good they are, however, most of them play for the same reasons. ""I want to stay young,"" says Brian Caputo. He says he's 73 but is quick to add, with a grin, ""Although I don't look it."" John Cusik is another player. ""Health is wealth,"" he says. ""If we could can this, we could sell it."" At this age, players have various health issues that sometimes keep them off the ice. Bibby Lewis is having trouble with his knee, and Joe Gatreau has missed four months because of his arthritis. This is his first day back. ""There's not going to be any good shots today,"" he says, laughing. Goalie Bill Parsely feels good today but admits, ""I feel my talents and skills are on a slippery slope to oblivion."" Besides staying in shape, there are other reasons they show up. Says Dick Lyons: ""Most of us miss the social dimensions of work, and this kind of compensates in a small way for that kind of camaraderie."" Adds Cusik: ""This is the only place you can go for an hour, hour and a half and all the cares are gone."" Jack Buonopane sums it up: ""It beats daytime television. That's for sure."" When the game is over, the unofficial score has both teams in a tie. The players congratulate and kid each other. Warren Lewis, the former All-American who played for BC, is happy. ""You can't get a better game than that,"" he says as he heads off the ice. ""That's kind of what we play for."" ""Bibby"" Lewis, who, like Warren, is 80, will come back to the rink as long he can. Hockey is everything to him. ""We do it,"" he says, ""and we come back for more.""","Seniors -- the Quincy Bald Eagles -- gather to play hockey .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A painting by Adolf Hitler sold for almost $15,000 Thursday -- more than six times as much as expected. Part of Hitler's oil painting ""Rural Houses and Trees"" The watercolor was one of 15 items of Hitler art being sold at auction. Together, the artworks by the Nazi leader fetched almost $120,000. They had expected to raise just under $50,000, auction house Mullock's of Shropshire estimated. Many of the pictures were on the market because one of the sellers wanted money to install a new central heating system in his house, a spokesman for the auction house said.  Watch the bidding on Hitler's paintings » . ""The watercolors came from a collector who is a regular vendor of ours,"" said Richard Westwood-Brookes, a historical documents expert at Mullock's. ""He'd forgotten about them for years. He found them in his garage."" He refused to disclose the identity of the seller, as a matter of policy. Thirteen watercolors were expected to fetch $580 to $2,200 apiece, while the lone small oil painting was estimated at up to $30,000, the auctioneer estimates. All of the watercolors shattered expectations -- 12 of them selling for between $4,400 and $9,000. The remaining watercolor -- a 1910 painting showing a figure sitting on a stone bridge -- fetched almost $15,000. There has been speculation that the figure was a depiction of Hitler himself. The oil painting sold at only almost $20,000. A pencil sketch signed ""A Hitler 1914"" went for almost $4,700, beating the auctioneer's estimate of up to $3,700. An easel thought to have belonged to Hitler sold for nearly $15,000, having been expected to bring $2,900 to $5,800. An anonymous bidder purchased it by phone. Hitler dreamed of being an artist as a young man, and although he failed to get into the Vienna Academy of Arts, he supported himself by painting watercolors for several years before World War I, according the Holocaust Encyclopedia of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The auction also includes dozens of items related to Hitler's time as leader of Nazi Germany -- including documents from concentration camps where those deemed ""undesirable"" by the Nazis were imprisoned, sterilized and murdered. Approximately 6 million Jews were killed in Nazi death camps, alongside millions of political prisoners, homosexuals, Gypsies and others. ""Who would want to have in their house a painting by the most horrible murderer in the history of mankind?"" asked Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center which aims to fight anti-Semitism. ""Any individual that would buy it to hang in their homes should be ashamed of themselves."" Hier said he did not object to Holocaust-related documents being auctioned ""if their purpose is to wind up in research institutions,"" noting his own organization had obtained ""important documents"" that way. Westwood-Brookes defended the sale of Nazi memorabilia. ""It's just as much as part of the Second World War as photographs of (Winston) Churchill,"" the British prime minister during the war. ""It's something that happened and you can't ignore it."" He said he hoped buyers would preserve items such as a teenage girl's registration document for the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp, where approximately 1 million people were murdered. ""The intention is that people will acquire this material and make sure it is preserved for future generations to study,"" Westwood-Brookes said. The buyers could be ""anybody and everybody,"" he said. ""There are many, many collectors of Second World War memorabilia all around the world,"" he added. ""Some people wouldn't want it,"" he admitted, but some would, ""mainly because they want something to do with a famous person in history. In this case it happens to be Hitler, but in another sale it might be Churchill or Gandhi."" ""I don't take any moral position"" on the sale of Hitler-related artifacts, he said. ""You can't say this guy was a bad guy, so I won't sell his memorabilia, this guy was a good guy so I will sell his. If you do that, where do you stop?"" The Hitler paintings came from three sources, Westwood-Brookes said, describing them as ""people who had collected them over the years."" ""The rest of the stuff has come in from all sorts of sources -- dealers who acquire stuff and sell stuff from other auction houses or private sources, members of the public who find something in the attic, and collectors, who are constantly changing their collections and selling off that bit that they don't want in order to buy stuff that they do.""","Hitler collection sells at auction for almost $120,000 .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy aircraft carrier resupplied a crippled cruise ship that is slowly being towed to San Diego, California, officials said Tuesday evening. The USS Ronald Reagan received 60,000 pounds of food, bottled water and supplies by airlift for the cruise ship Carnival Splendor, with its nearly 3,300 passengers and nearly 1,200 crew members, Cmdr. Greg Hicks, spokesman of the U.S. Third Fleet, said. The Carnival Splendor was stranded some 130 miles west of Ensenada, Mexico, earlier Tuesday, a day after it lost power following an engine-room fire, Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement. The ship and USS Ronald Reagan were about 150 miles south of San Diego Tuesday evening, Hicks said. The vessel is expected to arrive in San Diego late Thursday, said Carnival spokeswoman Joyce Oliva. The Reagan reached Carnival Splendor late Tuesday morning and supply deliveries were made by helicopter throughout the afternoon. Any supplies not delivered by sunset Tuesday were to be made Wednesday. ""It's gone very well so far,"" Hicks said. Sailors stood on the deck of the USS Ronald Reagan in 50-yard lines, handing off boxes of water, frozen bread, sandwich meats, granola bars, paper plates and more for the Splendor. ""We were on maneuvers necessary to get the crew ready for deployment,"" Lt. Cmdr. Kate Meadows told a CNN reporter on the carrier. ""But we were more than happy to respond and excited to be a part of helping the cruise ship."" Sailors who have been in contact with Splendor's passenger and crews reported no major problems, Meadows said. At least six sailors spent the night on the ship. The provisions were made available by Carnival Cruise Lines. One tugboat ""is in process of tow,"" Coast Guard Petty Officer Rachel Polish told CNN. Another tug is en route and will speed the slow process, she said. Carnival said it is making hotel and flight arrangements for guests once they reach port. It's possible the Splendor would be diverted to Ensenada if it cannot maintain sufficient speed under tow, according to a statement. The fire occurred about 6 a.m. Monday in the aft engine room of the Splendor, the cruise line said Tuesday in a statement posted on its website. The blaze was extinguished and no passengers or crew were injured. Oliva did not know the cause of the fire or when repairs might be completed once the ship is back in port. Officials said no passengers were evacuated from the ship for medical or any other reasons. Engineers were not able to restore power to the ship, which was operating on auxiliary generators, a Carnival statement said.  As of Tuesday, ""several key hotel systems, including air conditioning, hot food service and telephones are not available,"" the cruise line said. Engineers were able to restore toilet service to most cabins and all common-area bathrooms, as well as cold running water, the line said. ""The ship's crew continues to actively work to restore other services."" Guests are able to move about the vessel and children's activities and entertainment are being offered, Carnival said. Announcements advising guests of the situation began early Monday, the cruise line said. Guests initially were asked to move from their cabins to the open upper deck areas of the ship, but later were given access to their cabins and were able to move about the ship, Carnival said. Bottled water and cold food items were being provided. The voyage -- a seven-day cruise along the Mexican coast that departed Sunday from Long Beach, California -- was terminated, Carnival said. Carnival also has canceled a seven-day cruise that was to leave November 14 from Long Beach, California, the company said. At the request of the Coast Guard in San Diego, the Navy diverted the Ronald Reagan from training maneuvers. Thirty-five pallets of supplies were delivered to the aircraft carrier from a nearby Naval air station, officials said. Guests will receive a full refund and reimbursement for transportation costs, and will also receive a complimentary future cruise equal to the amount they paid for this voyage, Carnival said. ""We know this has been an extremely trying situation for our guests and we sincerely thank them for their patience,"" Gerry Cahill, president and CEO of Carnival Cruise Lines, said. ""Conditions on board the ship are very challenging and we sincerely apologize for the discomfort and inconvenience our guests are currently enduring. The safety of our passengers and crew is our top priority and we are working to get our guests home as quickly as possible."" The ship's normal itinerary included stops in Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The 952-foot Panamanian-flagged ship is carrying 3,299 guests and 1,167 crew members, according to the cruise line and the Coast Guard. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","Carnival Splendor resupplied, under tow .

"Top members of the computer hacker group ""Anonymous"" and its offshoots were arrested and charged Tuesday after a wide-ranging investigation used the help of a group leader who was working as a secret government informant. Five of the suspects, considered by investigators among the ""most sophisticated hackers in the world,"" were arrested in the United States and Europe and charged in a Manhattan federal court over their alleged role in high-profile cyberattacks against government agencies and large companies, according to an indictment. A sixth man, Hector Xavier Monsegur, a notorious hacker known as ""Sabu,"" pleaded guilty in August to computer hacking and other crimes. As part of his plea deal, Monsegur cooperated with government investigators and helped build a case against the five other defendants, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Ryan Ackroyd, 23; Jake Davis, 29; Darren Martyn, 25; and Donncha O'Cearrbhail, 19, have been charged  with conspiracy regarding attacks against Fox Broadcasting Co., Sony Pictures Entertainment and the Public Broadcasting Service, or PBS. O'Cearrbhail is also accused of hacking into the personal e-mail account of an Irish national police officer and eavesdropping on a conference call between Irish police, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies about ongoing investigations into Anonymous and other hacker groups. The suspect allegedly recorded the call and disseminated the recording to other hackers. Jeremy Hammond, 27, was charged with a December cyberattack against a Texas firm called Strategic Forecasting Inc., which authorities say might have affected about 860,000 people. O'Cearrbhail and Martyn are from Ireland, and Hammond is from Chicago, the indictment said. Ackroyd and Davis are from Britain. Monsegur, 28, in August pleaded guilty to 12 counts of computer hacking and other crimes. Known as a ""rooter,"" the New York City resident identified vulnerabilities in a variety of computer systems and then passed along that information to other hackers. Monsegur and others have claimed responsibility for cyberstrikes between December 2010 and June 2011 that included denial of service attacks against the websites of Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. A denial of service (DoS) attack typically involves the use of a large number of computers to bombard websites with phony requests for information, causing the site to temporarily shut down. Dubbed ""Operation Payback,"" authorities say the credit card and PayPal attacks were prompted by the firms' refusals to process donations to WikiLeaks, an organization that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information. The group's website has released thousands of classified diplomatic cables as well as confidential -- and, at times, controversial -- messages about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Authorities say Monsegur also hacked or launched DoS attacks against computer systems operated by the governments of Tunisia, Yemen, Algeria and Zimbabwe. Beginning in December 2010, the indictment said, Monsegur, Ackroyd, Davis, Martyn and O'Cearrbhail conspired as a splinter hacker group called Internet Feds and penetrated the website of Fine Gael, an Irish political party, as well as the computer systems of a security firm called HBGary Inc. and its affiliates. The group allegedly stole confidential data from about 80,000 user accounts associated with the firm. Then in 2011, apparently feeling the heat from investigators, the group formed another offshoot organization called Lulz Security, or LulzSec, the indictment said. LulzSec then ratcheted up ""a campaign of malicious cyberassaults on the websites and computer systems of various business and governmental entities in the United States and throughout the world."" Barrett Brown, who identifies as an  Anonymous spokesman, told CNN that Sabu recently took over leadership of LulzSec. He said the hacker also contacted him several months ago by instant message, and he described those communications as ""weird."" ""There have always been rumors from a couple of people (within Anonymous) something weird was going on with LulzSec when (Sabu) started,"" said Brown, whose Dallas apartment was visited by FBI agents early Tuesday morning. Brown said that he and others in Anonymous were upset with LulzSec and Sabu because Sabu had bragged about stealing credit card information. Still, he says, Tuesday's indictments won't disrupt the organization's actions over the long-term. ""There are more than enough people around,"" he said. ""Major operations going forward won't be interrupted. Authorities have said that leader within the organization was secretly working with government officials and aided their investigation. Anonymous is considered a loosely tied group of hackers, that have spawned affiliate bodies, and in recent years have focused their efforts on coordinating cyberattacks for political reasons or as retribution for the activities of governments and large corporations.","5 alleged hackers in the U.S. and Europe have been charged in Manhattan court .

"For all the noise about the State Department's final environmental review of the Keystone XL Pipeline being a ""blow"" to pipeline opponents, the report contains more than enough information for Secretary of State John Kerry -- a respected environmental champion -- to conclude that the pipeline is not in the national interest. Although you have to dig a bit, the report recognizes the dangers associated with the tar sands fuel that the pipeline would transport. Oil from tar sands spews 17% more greenhouse gas than the average crude oil refined in the United States.  If the pipeline operates at capacity, that's as much carbon pollution as 5.7 million more cars driving on our roads.  This is enough added pollution to erase as much as 70% of the carbon pollution reductions from the Obama administration's recent motor vehicle emission standards. Using the Obama administration's estimates of the social cost of carbon, that adds up to $128 billion in climate costs over the lifetime of the project, costs that can too often be measured in parched farmland, compromised human health and property damage from floods. So how does the report admit the possibility of lasting environmental harm from the tar sands on the one hand while concluding that building the pipeline would not cause an increase in greenhouse gas emissions on the other? It presumes that the tar sands fuels are going to get to market anyway, so the environmental damage happens with or without Keystone XL. Opinion: Keystone a pipeline to future of dirty fuel . We think this presumption is seriously flawed. One key assumption is the report's forecast that crude oil prices will stay above $75 per barrel.  Below that price, the report actually finds that Keystone does make a difference in driving tar sands production and greater carbon pollution. Contrary to the report's assumptions, there is a real chance that crude oil prices will fall below that level. Energy commodity traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and experts at the International Energy Agency forecast a sharp decline in oil prices over the next decade. The Energy Information Agency's low oil price forecast, which assumes slower economic growth in developing countries, projects oil prices around $75 or below from 2015 through 2040.  In addition, the more successful international efforts are at promoting energy efficiency and new forms of clean energy, the more demand for traditional fossil fuels will shrink, pushing prices down. The report also presumes that all tar sands growth will come from low- cost projects, and higher cost tar sands projects won't be built with or without the pipeline.  That's unrealistic: Higher cost projects are moving forward, but their continued economic viability will depend on variables such as low-cost transportation as well as sufficiently high oil prices. The tar sands producers themselves belie the claim that Keystone XL won't make a difference in bringing the tar sands to market.  The CEO of major tar sands producer Cenovus admitted that his company's plan to triple production in coming years was contingent on more pipeline capacity.  Financial giants such as RBC Capital, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and CIBC have all linked the size of the tar sands industry to the availability of new pipelines.  The desperate push over this pipeline shows how badly tar sands producers need Keystone XL. Opinion: Keystone XL pipeline makes sense . Perhaps most serious, the State Department report fails to take into account the actions needed to prevent catastrophic climate change. In Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009, the United States and more than 100 other nations agreed that we need to limit the global temperature increase from carbon pollution to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). President Barack Obama affirmed that goal in his Climate Action Plan. According to the models used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change analysis, we must keep atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations below 450 parts per million to achieve the 2 degrees target.  That's not possible if we maintain the status quo, much less bring online more and exceedingly dirty sources of fuel such as tar sands oil. In a glaring omission, the Keystone XL review failed to factor in the 2 degrees limit, and assumed the continuation of business-as-usual practices for the next quarter century.  We have almost no chance of meeting the 2 degree goal if any of the report's scenarios are realized. Kerry's obligation is to determine what is in the national interest.  For all its flaws, the report acknowledges that the tar sands that would get to market through Keystone XL could significantly worsen climate change.  That's a risk that climate champions such as Kerry and Obama shouldn't be willing to take.","Writers: Review of Keystone XL pipeline information shows it's not in the national interest .

"New York (CNN) -- A day after saying homosexuality is not ""an equally valid or successful option,"" New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino denied being anti-gay Monday but said it was ""disgusting"" that his opponent took his children to a gay pride parade. ""I've been to one (parade) in Toronto. I saw the men in their little Speedos, gyrating on each other. I think that's disgusting. And any father who would take his children to such things, is not really thinking of the fatherly responsibilities -- is more interested in politics,"" Paladino told CNN at the Columbus Day Parade in New York City. Andrew Cuomo, the New York attorney general and Paladino's Democratic opponent, shot back later Monday: ""He's probably the last person I'll take advice from ... on how to raise my daughters."" Paladino drew fire for a remark he made to an Orthodox Jewish group on Sunday, in which he said he doesn't want children ""to be brainwashed into thinking that homosexuality is an equally valid or successful option (compared with heterosexuality) ... it isn't."" Cuomo criticized his remarks Sunday, as did an advocate for gays and lesbians and an organization for gay and lesbian Republicans. Paladino defended that remark Monday, telling both ""Today"" and ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he was referring to the difficult path homosexuals face because of discrimination. ""It's a very, very ugly experience for those who are discriminated against,"" he told ""Today,"" adding that he has a nephew who is homosexual and also has homosexuals working for him. ""It's terrible, and it shouldn't be. Society should be more accepting of it."" ""When I talk about issues such as this, I talk from my heart,"" he told NBC, ""and I expect that the press will properly interpret my remarks. If they don't interpret my remarks correctly ... that's wrong."" ""My nephew is a wonderful boy and he's gay,"" he told ""Good Morning America."" ""I see the difficulty he suffers with every day with discriminatory people."" Paladino's nephew, Jeffrey Hannon, a member of his campaign staff, declined to comment when contacted by CNN early Monday. Asked whether he believes homosexuality is a choice, Paladino said, ""I've had difficulty with that. My nephew tells me he didn't have that choice, and I believe it's a very, very difficult life for a young person. I believe that young people should not necessarily be exposed to that without some really, really mature background first so they can learn to deal with it. It's a very difficult thing, and I sensitize with it totally."" He said his Sunday remarks were taken out of context. A prepared version of his remarks, obtained by CNN from New York affiliate NY1, contained two lines that Paladino did not deliver. Those lines said, ""There is nothing to be proud of in being a dysfunctional homosexual. That is not how God created us."" Paladino emphasized in a statement Sunday night that he did not include those lines when he delivered his remarks, and said Monday he had crossed them out from his prepared remarks. ""There was a couple lines in there that I deleted and never spoke, purposefully, because I didn't want to,"" he told CNN. It was unclear, however, how the lines got into his prepared statements. Paladino at first suggested to ""Today"" that the lines were written by members of the Jewish group he was speaking to, although he later said he wasn't sure whether they originated with a group member or one of his staff. He told ""Good Morning America"" he had dictated in general terms his remarks to a staffer who put the lines in his remarks. Paladino told CNN he didn't know who wrote the remarks. ""Somebody wrote them and gave them to our staff as their suggested position on something,"" he said. In his Sunday statement, Paladino said, ""Apparently a few reporters relied upon suggested remarks distributed by my hosts at the synagogue in Williamsburg after my departure, not the actual statement I made."" The written remarks given to reporters were identical to Paladino's spoken comments other than the two sentences in question. Paladino on Monday denied being homophobic. ""I am 100 percent in favor of all gay rights and always have been. There's one reservation. I don't think they should be married,"" he told CNN. He told NBC he would recruit homosexuals to serve in key roles in his government if he is elected. Paladino's Monday remarks came the same day New York police announced the arrest of an ninth suspect in a series of brutal, anti-gay hate crimes against four men. The incident in early October involved three victims being held against their will by as many as nine assailants who beat them in a vacant apartment and sodomized two of them, police said. A fourth victim was beaten and robbed in connection with the attacks. ""Don't misquote me as wanting to hurt homosexual people in any way,"" Paladino said Sunday. ""That would be a dastardly lie -- my approach is live and let live."" ""I just think my children and your children would be much better off and much more successful getting married and raising a family,"" he said. Asked on Monday whether the timing of his remark was poor, given the incident, Paladino said no. ""I think my comments were directed at just the confusion that people have had over this issue,"" he said. Paladino also criticized Cuomo for marching in New York's gay pride parade in June. ""That's not the example that we should be showing the children and certainly not in our schools,"" he said. Asked about Paladino's comments later Monday, Cuomo called them cynical and divisive. ""They were reckless in light of recent violence that we've had,"" Cuomo said. ""They were divisive, they were the worst cynical politics trying to pit groups against one another."" New York ""celebrates our diversity"" with festivities such as the Columbus Day parade and the gay rights parade, he said. ""You're not going to make it a negative, you're not going to play one off against another. We won't let it happen in New York."" On Sunday, Cuomo spokesman Josh Vlasto called Paladino's comments homophobic and said they showed he was ""unfit to represent New York."" Gay rights groups also criticized Paladino's remarks. ""Carl Paladino's comments would matter if they were coming from a serious political figure. However, they are not,"" said Christopher Barron, chairman of the gay conservative group GOProud, in an e-mail to CNN. ""They are instead coming from the imploding campaign of a man with the personal baggage of John Edwards and all the electability of Alan Keyes."" The Log Cabin Republicans of New York State also took issue with the candidate. ""Carl Paladino's statements are unfortunate and show he lacks an understanding of what it means to be gay,"" said Gregory T. Angelo, chairman of the group. ""I think gay men and women -- my neighbors and your neighbors -- would be much better off and much more successful if they were allowed equal rights and the option of getting married and raising a family. I don't want New Yorkers to be brainwashed into thinking that ignorance is an equally valid and successful option. It isn't."" But Paladino's campaign manager, Michael Caputo, stood by the gubernatorial candidate's comments on homosexuality. ""Carl Paladino's position on this is exactly equivalent to the Catholic Church,"" Caputo told CNN. ""And if Andrew Cuomo has a problem with the Catholic Church's position on abortion and homosexuality, he needs to take it up with his parish priest."" Paladino was seen on cell phone video by CNN affiliate YNN Albany last month seemingly threatening New York Post statehouse columnist Fred Dicker, after he was pressed to back up allegations he'd made that Cuomo had been unfaithful in his marriage. ""You send another goon to my daughter's house, and I'll take you out, buddy,"" Paladino said, apparently referring to the Post's coverage of a daughter the candidate had out of wedlock. Dicker shot back: ""You gonna take me out?"" ""Yeah."" ""How you gonna do that?"" ""Watch,"" Paladino said before walking off. Paladino's campaign issued a statement the next day claiming that the Post sent a photographer to the Buffalo-area house where Paladino's 10-year-old daughter lives. On October 5, a statement on the candidate's website about his ideas for economic reform in the state said, ""I'm a builder, not a career politician. I may not always say things in the most delicate or diplomatic way, but I will always tell you the truth and the truth is New York State is in a death spiral."" CNN's Cheryl Robinson, Mark Preston and Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","New York AG says he rejects opponent Carl Paladino's advice on raising daughters .

"(CNN) -- The disclosure Saturday by Japanese authorities that milk and spinach have shown higher-than-normal levels of radiation contamination has raised concerns about food safety and supplies in one of Japan's most heavily populated regions. Tainted milk was found 30 kilometers (18 1/2 miles) from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and spinach was collected as far as 100 kilometers (65 miles) to the south, almost halfway to Tokyo. The plant was badly damaged after a 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit the coast on March 11. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano stressed to reporters Saturday afternoon that the levels were not extremely high: A person who consumed these products continuously for a year, he said, would take in the same amount of radiation as that of a single CT scan. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said that equates to 7 millisieverts, more than double the 3 millisieverts that a person in an industrialized country is typically exposed to in a year. Health effects would become more evident, he said, if such products were taken in daily for a lifetime. Edano said high radiation levels were not systemic for all spinach and milk tested, and that more data would be collected and analyzed under the Japanese health ministry's watch to help determine what steps to take next. The Fukushima prefecture, or province, is just to the northeast of Tokyo. According to the prefecture's website, Fukushima plays an important role in supplying food, not only to Tokyo, but also to the nation. The prefecture is Japan's fourth-largest farmland area and ranks among the top producer of fruits, vegetables, rice, tobacco and raw silk. The favorable climate lends itself to an active agricultural industry that includes livestock farming. The website also states that the prefecture's 159 kilometer-long coastline is home to a thriving fishing and seafood processing industry, and the area's haul of fish is among Japan's largest. Neighboring Ibaraki prefecture supplies Tokyo with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables. Ibaraki is the largest producer of Andes melons in Japan, according to the prefecture's website, as well as the country's third-largest producer of pork. The impact on rice production in the area is also a source of concern. Rice is Japan's largest crop. Rice paddies account for 55% of Japan's farmland, and about 85% of the 2.3 million farms in Japan plant rice annually. While the value of the rice industry relative to the national economy has declined in recent years, rice production is culturally significant and an important part of Japanese heritage. Fukushima prefecture contributed 4.5% of Japan's total rice production in 2010. Ibaraki prefecture is the country's second-largest producer of Koshihikari,a gourmet variety of rice. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Japan's rice-growing season starts in April (depending on the region) and this year's crop could remain unaffected, depending on how much radiation is released and in which direction, as well as how long it takes to clear farmland of contaminated soil. Jim Walsh, CNN consultant and international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, warned that should a reactor suffer a meltdown and radiation reach ground water, the situation would be much worse, as it would be impossible to tell where the contamination starts and stops. So, how does food become contaminated? According to the World Health Organization, the surface of foods like fruits and vegetables or animal feed can become radioactive by the deposit of radioactive materials falling on it from the air or through rainwater. Over time, radioactivity can also build up within food, as radionuclides are transferred through soil into crops or animals (and thereby tainting milk), or into rivers, lakes and the sea, where fish and shellfish could take up the radionuclides. Radionuclides are elements in an unstable form that emit radiation. The severity of the risk depends on the radionuclide mix and the level of contaminant released. The health organization says packaged food is not susceptible to radiation contamination as long as the food is sealed. The organization warned that ""food contaminated with radioactive material will not appear spoiled, but consuming such food will increase the amount of radioactivity a person is exposed to and could increase the health risks associated with exposure."" It went on to recommend that people avoid consumption of locally produced vegetables and milk, as well as fishing, hunting and slaughtering animals. As of right now, Japan appears to have adequate stockpiles of staples such as rice, but getting food to some of the hardest-hit regions is proving difficult. If current radiation levels hold, the farming community, while affected, could be spared. With the situation being so fluid, however, it's impossible to tell what impact this disaster will have on an already devastated population.","The Fukushima province is the top producer of fruits, vegetables, rice .

"(CNN)Dwight B. Heath knows what he is about to say will sound a little crazy to most people. When asked what the minimum legal drinking age should be in the U.S., Heath says 8, or maybe even 6. No, the Brown University anthropology professor is not advocating getting kids drunk. Instead he favors a cultural model, common in countries like France or Italy, where parents serve small amounts of wine to their children at family meals. By doing this, he says, parents educate their kids about alcohol and rob drinking of its taboo allure, which can make rebellious teenagers sneak off to basements and backwoods to binge drink far from adult supervision. ""In general, the younger people start to drink the safer they are,"" said Heath, who has written several books and hundreds of scholarly articles on cultural attitudes towards alcohol. When introduced early, he said, ""Alcohol has no mystique. It's no big deal. By contrast, where it's banned until age 21, there's something of the 'forbidden fruit' syndrome."" Of course, Heath's idea has no chance of becoming law anytime soon. Thirty years ago this week, Congress passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21. Despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states -- and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 -- that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since. Proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol-related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens, whose brains are still developing. But as the U.S. marks Thursday's anniversary of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, Heath and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question: Would America be better served by reducing its drinking age -- or at least encouraging states to set their own limits? The World Health Organization cites the U.S. as one of only a handful of developed countries -- Iceland, Japan, South Korea and Thailand are others -- with a minimum drinking age over 18. Several countries, including Belgium, Denmark and Germany, even allow 16-year-olds to buy beer and wine. ""I think 18 is viewed (by most countries) pretty much as a reasonable age limit,"" said Marjana Martinic, deputy president of the International Center for Alcohol Policies or ICAP. ""The Puritan ethic has really shaped the way alcohol is regulated in the U.S.,"" Martinic said. ""Alcohol is seen more as a drug, and not something that's integrated into everyday life."" MADD about underage drinking . Two generations of younger Americans have never known anything but needing to be 21 -- or owning an ID that says you are -- to buy a six-pack or drink in a bar. But in the wide-lapeled 1970s, things were very different. After Congress in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18, many states followed suit by lowering decades-old barriers to drinking. The rationale went something like this: If young Americans could be entrusted to vote, serve on a jury and fight in Vietnam, why couldn't they order a beer? By the late 1970s, more than half the states in the U.S. had lowered their minimum drinking ages, usually from 21 to 18. But when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states, state legislatures began to reverse course. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, founded in 1980, quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit. On July 17, 1984, Congress passed a law that withheld federal highway funding from every state that continued to allow people under 21 to buy alcohol -- effectively forcing them to raise their drinking ages. By 1995, faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from MADD, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied. Is alcohol and the teen brain a bad mix? Many studies have since attempted to gauge the law's impact on public health. One found that among young drivers (ages 16-20) killed in car wrecks, the percentage with positive blood-alcohol levels declined from 61% in 1982 to 31% in 1995 -- a bigger decline than for older age groups. ""Minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved,"" said the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in a statement. The NHTSA estimates that raising the national legal drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved more than 500 lives each year. ""Research shows that it saves lives,"" agreed MADD National President Jan Withers. ""In fact, it is one of the most researched public health laws on the books. When the law was raised to 21, alcohol-related deaths for young people decreased; when the drinking age was lowered, deaths increased."" A recent study in New Zealand, which lowered its drinking age in 1999 from 20 to 18, found that drivers aged 18 or 19 now face a higher risk of being involved in alcohol-related crashes that cause death or injury. The 21-year-old limit may be less effective at curbing binge drinking on college campuses, however. A University of Indiana study of students at 56 colleges found that in the immediate aftermath of 21 becoming the national drinking age, significantly more underage students drank compared to those of legal age. A stalled movement . There's a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the U.S., and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner. He's a university president. Weary of battling drinking on campus during his tenure as president of Middlebury College, John McCardell Jr. penned a column in The New York Times assailing  the 21-year-old drinking age as ""bad social policy and terrible law."" ""Right now we're in an impossible position (on college campuses). Why should we be expected to enforce a law that's ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come (to college)?"" McCardell, now president of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, told CNN this week. ""It's taking place behind closed doors, where it's much more dangerous. It's unsupervised,"" he said. ""It's out of step with social reality."" CNN Opinion: Get real, lower drinking age to 19 . Instead, he argues, colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly, within campus boundaries and out in the open. In 2008 McCardell recruited more than 130 college presidents to sign the Amethyst Initiative, which pushed for a new federal transportation bill that wouldn't penalize states for setting drinking ages under 21. He said he and other college presidents were set to testify before Congress that fall when the economy tanked and legislators' priorities turned elsewhere. ""We missed our moment,"" he said. Lawmakers in a handful of states have proposed lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18, but none have gained traction so far. Experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election. A 2007 Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans opposed lowering the drinking age in all states to 18. ""There isn't much appetite to change something that appears to be working,"" said Martinic of ICAP. ""It's not a very popular issue and it could potentially be damaging to a politician to advocate for a lower age, because nobody wants more traffic accidents. It's pretty much a no go."" But McCardell is not giving up. He believes legal limits for drinking should be set by the states, not the federal government. And he proposes that American teens be eligible for an alcohol permit -- not unlike a driver's license -- upon turning 18, graduating from high school and completing an alcohol-education course. They would need the permit to buy beer, wine or liquor, and the state could revoke the permit for those convicted of alcohol-related offenses such as drunk driving.","Thursday is 30th anniversary of bill that effectively raised U.S. drinking age to 21 .

"(CNN) -- Oil company BP says it has resumed pumping oil to a ship on the surface after a weekend setback that halted efforts to siphon off the crude spewing from a damaged well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. Crews re-inserted the tube into the well's riser stack Sunday. The 4-inch pipe is now connected to a ship on the surface, 5,000 feet above the sea floor, and is pumping oil back to the surface, BP spokesman Mark Proegler told CNN. If successful, the technique will capture most of the oil that is pouring out of the well.  The well has been spewing an estimated 210,000 gallons, or 5,000 barrels, of light sweet crude a day into the Gulf since the sinking of the drill platform Deepwater Horizon in late April. ""In terms of containing the flow, this was a positive step forward,"" said Kent Wells, a senior vice president for BP. Wells said that crews were operating the tool cautiously as they make adjustments to achieve an optimal flow rate up to the drill ship. ""We'll look over the next day or two as we continue to optimize this to see the impact we can have on reducing the amount of flow"" from the ruptured pipe, he said. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar issued a joint statement Sunday expressing caution about the effectiveness of the insertion tube. ""This technique is not a solution to the problem, and it is not yet clear how successful it may be,"" the statement said. ""We are closely monitoring BP's test with the hope that it will contain some of the oil, but at the same time, federal scientists are continuing to provide oversight and expertise to BP as they move forward with other strategies to contain the spill and stop the flow of oil."" The effort was dealt a setback Friday night, when the frame holding the insertion tube shifted and prevented the surface vessel from connecting to it, said Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production. The system was able to capture some of the leaking oil and pipe it aboard a drill ship on the surface overnight and burned off some of the natural gas released in the process, according to a statement from the joint BP-Coast Guard command center leading the response to the oil spill. Wells said the next step in stopping the flow will be a ""top kill"" procedure in which a large amount of kill mud -- a heavy fluid used in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore to reduce pressure and reduce flow. Once the pressure is reduced, BP hopes to be able to entomb the well in cement, effectively cutting off the gusher. The statement from Napolitano and Salazar emphasized the importance of that step, saying ""We will not rest until BP permanently seals the wellhead, the spill is cleaned up, and the communities and natural resources of the Gulf Coast are restored and made whole."" Wells said the mud will be pumped through the bottom of the well's blowout preventer at a maximum rate of 40 barrels (1,680 gallons) a minute. ""So with all of the pumping horsepower we have on the surface, we'll be able to pump far faster than the well can flow, and it's about us outracing the well,"" he said. Preparations for the top kill procedure will take place over the next seven to 10 days, Wells said. The slick from the spill has spread across much of the northern Gulf of Mexico, with bits of oil washing up periodically onto the shores of Louisiana's barrier islands. Suttles said the application of underwater dispersants -- a tactic approved for use Friday -- appears to be working. ""The oil in the immediate vicinity of the well and the ships and rigs working in the area is diminished from previous observations,"" he said after flying over the area Saturday. The Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the decision to use subsea dispersants is an ""important step"" aimed at reducing potential damage from the spill, because dispersants can be more effective underwater than on the ocean's surface. But more recent estimates suggest the actual volume of oil could be far higher than the estimated 5,000 barrels per day. Ray Highsmith, executive director of the University of Mississippi's National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology, said that plumes of oil appear to have settled beneath the surface. ""We're clearly detecting something,"" Highsmith said. Either oil has settled on the bottom or it has risen to the surface and sunk again, as happened in the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. ""This is a very different spill than we've ever had before, and we need to learn as much about it as we can,"" he said. The underwater gusher began after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon. The explosion and subsequent fire caused the Deepwater Horizon to sink two days later, prompting oil to begin spilling from the well. BP was leasing the rig from Transocean. CNN's David Mattingly and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.","BP: ""In terms of containing the flow, this was a positive step forward""

"Justin Goforth was just a 26-year-old nursing student when he had unprotected sex with another man and, as a result, got the diagnosis that changed his life. ""I started to feel like I had the flu -- aches, pains, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, that kind of thing -- and so I went to my doctor ... we did a viral load test, which was rare back then ... and he called me and said, you know, it came back (HIV) positive."" It was 1992. Goforth's doctor immediately sent him to the National Institutes of Health, where research was being done, but treatment options were, at the time, still few. Patients were being treated with AZT, the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987 to treat HIV/AIDS in the United States -- by then known for its serious, even life-threatening side effects. The reality of the diagnosis set in. ""I was so sick,"" Goforth says. ""I was sitting silently and crying because of my circumstance ... and the nurse came over and was trying to console me, I believe, and said ... 'Because you were just infected, you may have, you know, six or eight years before you die.' ""I think she was trying to cheer me up,"" he says. ""Didn't work very well, but that's just a good commentary on where we were at the time"" Bill Gates: Where to put the smart money to end AIDS . That was then, but what does it mean to have HIV today, after years of research and advances in treatment? ""It means likely you can have a normal lifespan and have a similar life to someone who does not have HIV,"" says Dr. Ray Martins, chief medical officer at Whitman-Walker Health in Washington, which provides health care services for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. ""For people who had to deal with the medications and stuff from the '80s and '90s, it was a bit of a rough road there, so figuring out the virus and the medications that would work effectively with the least side effects, it took a while,"" Martins says. ""But now we're at the point where we have three options for one pill, once-a-day regimens with very little side effects."" In 1981, when the virus was discovered, being HIV-positive was considered a death sentence. For most patients today, it's a chronic disease, much like diabetes or heart disease. Goforth is a perfect example. He has been living with the disease for 21 years and today is a healthy 47-year-old. Instead of the difficult treatment regimen he was on back then. which included some 40 pills five times a day with ""horrific"" side effects, he now takes five pills twice a day ""with virtually no side effects,"" he says. For the last 7½ years, Goforth, who is a registered nurse, has worked at Whitman-Walker in a variety of positions, including director of nursing and in case management. He sees potentially thousands of patients each year, and has personally delivered the same news he got two decades ago to more than 200 patients. But he tells them living with HIV today means that you can be healthy, thrive and live a normal lifespan without complications. ""You can go to your doctor two, three times a year, get some tests done and make sure everything's on track, and then just live the rest of your life as you would,"" he says. ""Follow your dreams ... have your career, your family, or whatever it is that you'd like to do with your life, and that is the truth of where we are."" Today's science, he said, supports that. Interactive: World AIDS Day 2013 . ""We are at a place that we actually have the tools we need  to stop the epidemic and then just get to a point where we're just taking care of the people who have HIV throughout their life,"" he says. ""But because of how horrible the first 10, 20 years of this (epidemic) was, we have collectively this culture of what it means to be infected and affected by HIV that still is this huge block, this huge barrier for people understanding that they can get into care and they can be OK and that it's not something to be afraid of."" About 1.1 million Americans live with HIV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But because of improved treatments, they're living longer and their quality of life is better. ""If a person is HIV infected today, it is important that they put themselves under the care of a physician experienced in caring for HIV-infected individuals,"" says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. ""Depending on the stage of infection, it is highly likely that it will be recommended that the person begin antiretroviral therapy (ART)."" ART is a combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs that prevents the virus from replicating. It can also help reduce virus transmission. Unlike years ago, when effective treatments were not available, HIV patients now benefit significantly from ART, Fauci says. ""These drugs are highly effective in suppressing HIV replication and, if taken as directed, can result in the HIV-infected individual having an almost normal lifespan without experiencing serious illness related to their HIV infection."" And so, on this 25th World AIDS Day, Goforth has mixed emotions. It's a day that, in the past, has been incredibly sad and traumatic for him. Now, he says, he has tremendous hope. ""I see the freight train being slowed down so that we can turn it around,"" he says. ""Even five, six years ago, I'm not sure that I could have said that I had the hope that that was going to happen, but I think we're at that point we're at a really historical moment with this."" Each November in advance of World AIDS Day, POZ, an award winning magazine started in 1994 to provide education and information for people living with and affected by the disease, names its ""POZ 100"" -- HIV-positive people who are unsung heroes in the fight against AIDS, and committed to ending the epidemic. This year, Goforth is on that list. World AIDS Day 25 years on: It's time to stop saying 'AIDS in Africa'","Justin Goforth thought his 1992 diagnosis was a death sentence .

"(CNN) -- A suicide car bomb exploded Friday in the middle of a group of men playing volleyball in northwest Pakistan, killing 75 and wounding 60, district police officials told CNN. The attack was the second this week in Pakistan to inflict major civilian casualties following Monday's suicide bombing in Karachi targeting a Shiite procession which left at least 40 people dead. The terror attack happened in a residential neighborhood in the Lakki Marwat district of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, police said. Some of the casualties were residents from houses around the volleyball court, district police Chief Mohammed Ayub Khan told CNN. Khan said eight houses in the neighborhood collapsed, and the blast was so powerful it could be felt from 11 miles (18 kilometers) away. He said he believes that more than 600 pounds of explosives (300 kilograms) were used. Volleyball is a popular sport in the area, and more than 200 people were watching the game when the bomb went off, the police chief said. District police officer Asmat Ullah said it exploded in the village of Shah Hassan Khel, which is about 10 miles south of the district capital, also called Lakki Marwat, he said. The area used to be a hub for militants before the military flushed them out about two months ago, the police chief said. Since then, militants have been making threats to the community, Mushtaq Marwatt, a member of a local peace committee, said on a local TV channel. Earlier Friday in the nearby district of North Waziristan, a suspected U.S. drone attack killed four people, a Pakistani intelligence official said. A guided missile was fired at a car carrying militants at 8:50 a.m. in the village of Naurak, about 9.3 miles east of Miran Shah, according to an official from the political administration and an intelligence official. One other person was hurt in the attack, the officials said. It was not immediately clear whether those killed and injured were militants, the officials said. Two of the dead were Pakistanis. The nationality of the other two could not be immediately confirmed. The largely autonomous tribal region of North Waziristan is near the rugged border with Afghanistan. The border area has been the scene of heavy fighting between Pakistani military forces and the Taliban, the Islamic militia that also is battling U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported drone attacks. However, it is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. A third unrelated attack Friday also took place near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. A remote-controlled explosive struck a car and killed five civilians, according to a representative from the Frontier Corps and a political administration official. It happened around 10 a.m. in the Salar Zar subdivision, in the Bajaur agency of the North West Frontier Province. Journalists Nasir Dawar and Nazar ul-Islam contributed to this report.","Area was hub for militants until military flushed them out two months ago .

"A controversial New York Police Department surveillance unit that cataloged information on Muslim communities has been disbanded, according to the department. The NYPD's Demographics Unit -- or Zone Assessment Unit -- was developed with the CIA's help after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The unit has acknowledged that it engaged in monitoring that included Muslim-owned business and mosques across the New York region and has been the target of controversy and civil lawsuits. ""The Zone Assessment Unit, previously referred to as the demographics unit, has been largely inactive since January,"" the department said in a statement Tuesday. ""Recently, as part of an ongoing assessment of Intelligence Bureau operations, personnel assigned to the Zone Assessment Unit were reassigned to other duties within the Intelligence Bureau."" The statement continued: ""Understanding certain local demographics can be a useful factor when assessing information regarding potential threats coming to the attention of the New York City Police Department, it has been determined that much of the same information previously gathered by the Zone Assessment Unit may be obtained through direct outreach by the NYPD to the communities concerned."" Two advocacy groups that filed a lawsuit challenging the unit and its activities said they were pleased it had been disbanded but want to ensure the surveillance stops. ""While we welcome the dismantling of the Demographics Unit as a long overdue step towards reining in the unconstitutional excesses of the NYPD, what has to stop is the practice of suspicion-less surveillance of Muslim communities, not just the unit assigned to do it,"" said a joint statement by Muslim Advocates and the Center for Constitutional Rights, which filed the lawsuit in 2012. ""We will continue to work, through litigation and advocacy, to ensure the NYPD is fully and finally respecting the rights of the Muslim community."" That suit, Hassan v. City of New York, was dismissed in February and is currently under appeal. The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations echoed those sentiments. ""This is an important first step. However, the damage of unconstitutional mass spying on people solely on the basis of their religion has already been carried out and must be addressed,"" said Board President Ryan Mahoney. This decision and the city's move to drop an appeal of a federal judge's August ruling that the controversial stop-and-frisk practice violated the Constitution are seen as signs of changes in the way the city operates. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton have replaced former Mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Commissioner Ray Kelly. ""Our administration has promised the people of New York a police force that keeps our city safe, but that is also respectful and fair. This reform is a critical step forward in easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve, so that our cops and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys,"" de Blasio said in a statement Tuesday. Bratton, who was police commissioner in the 1990s, once again took the helm of the nation's largest police department in December at a time of low crime rates but heightened tension with the public over his predecessor's controversial policies. When Bratton was introduced as New York City police commissioner, he talked about bringing the police and the public ""together in a collaboration of mutual respect and mutual trust."" ""I will get it right again in New York City,"" Bratton said. In February: Spying on Muslims is legal?","NYPD started the Demographics Unit after 9/11 and monitored Muslim business, mosques .

"President Barack Obama on Wednesday outlined a foreign policy vision of ""might doing right,"" arguing that modern pragmatism requires both a strong military and the diplomatic tools of alliances and sanctions to exert influence and provide global leadership. He told graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point that after the nation's ""long season of war and divisions about how to move forward,"" they now would represent America with the duty ""not only to protect our country, but to do what is right and just."" Under fire from the political right for what critics call diminishing U.S. global influence, Obama offered a robust defense of his foreign policy as the pragmatic and most effective expression of America's leadership role in the world. ""I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being,"" he said, referring to a tenet of conservative ideology. ""But what makes us exceptional is not flouting international norms and the rule of law; it's our willingness to affirm them through our actions,"" Obama said in arguing that true leadership involves not only having the world's most powerful military, but in doing the right thing. ""America must always lead on the world stage,"" Obama said, and the military ""always will be the backbone of that leadership,"" but U.S. military action ""cannot be the only -- or even primary -- component of our leadership in every instance."" In a direct jab at his detractors, the President said those ""who suggest that America is in decline, or has seen its global leadership slip away, are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics."" One of the most strident critics, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, responded Wednesday by telling CNN that America remained mighty but Obama has failed to follow through on threats such as his ""red line"" for U.S. military strikes if the Syrian government used chemical weapons. ""We are unreliable, and all our allies and our enemies believe that,"" said McCain, who lost to Obama in the 2008 presidential election. To George Mitchell, the former Senate leader who served as Obama's Middle East peace envoy, the President ""made a persuasive case to the reality that we cannot intervene militarily everywhere."" However, Mitchell said the United States should have done more to help the Syrian opposition without sending U.S. troops. Read the President's speech . In a sign of the sentiments of the cadets and those attending their commencement ceremony, Obama got big applause when he noted they were the first West Point graduates in more than a decade unlikely to be stationed in a war zone. Since he took office, Obama noted, America had ended the Iraq war and was preparing to end the Afghanistan conflict, decimated al Qaeda's leadership in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and eliminated Osama bin Laden. Now it was time to shift foreign policy to combat a continuing terrorist threat that ""no longer comes from a centralized al Qaeda leadership,"" but from ""decentralized al Qaeda affiliates and extremists, with agendas focused in the countries where they operate."" ""This lessens the possibility of large-scale 9/11-style attacks against the homeland, but heightens the danger of U.S. personnel overseas being attacked, as we saw in Benghazi,"" Obama said in reference to the 2012 assault that killed four Americans at a U.S. compound in Libya. ""It heightens the danger to less defensible targets, as we saw in a shopping mall in Nairobi,"" he said of the attack last year in Kenya. ""So we have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse threat; one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch our military thin, or stir up local resentments."" Obama also spoke of his personal burden as a wartime leader, saying he was ""haunted"" by the dead and wounded among troops he ordered to Afghanistan. ""I would betray my duty to you, and to the country we love, if I sent you into harm's way simply because I saw a problem somewhere in the world that needed to be fixed, or because I was worried about critics who think military intervention is the only way for America to avoid looking weak,"" he told the graduating cadets. Returning to a theme he's visited throughout his presidency, Obama said he would continue to push for closing the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay ""because American values and legal traditions don't permit the indefinite detention of people beyond our borders."" Overall, Obama said, ""America has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world,"" and he contended that ""those who argue otherwise -- who suggest that America is in decline, or has seen its global leadership slip away -- are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics."" ""The question we face -- the question each of you will face -- is not whether America will lead, but how we will lead, not just to secure our peace and prosperity, but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe,"" Obama told the cadets. The President's speech came a day after he spelled out a plan that would leave nearly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan at year's end but essentially end the broader U.S. military commitment there by the end of 2016. ""We can not only responsibly end our war in Afghanistan and achieve the objectives that took us to war in the first place, we'll also be able to begin a new chapter in the story of American leadership around the world,"" Obama said in the White House Rose Garden on Tuesday. Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai welcomed Obama's announcement of planned troop levels, saying in a statement posted Wednesday on his official website that his government was ""grateful to the international community for its assistance and remains confident"" in the ability of the expanded and NATO-trained Afghan forces to protect the country and its people. 5 foreign policy headaches for Obama . Although Obama enjoyed high-profile foreign-policy successes at the beginning of his time in office, including the military mission to find and kill bin Laden, he's come under harsh criticism recently for what opponents say is a passive approach abroad. They cite his record in Syria, where he backed away from airstrikes after President Bashar al-Assad's regime was reported to have used chemical weapons on citizens. Congress balked at approving the military force, leaving Obama to instead negotiate a deal that would remove the chemical stockpiles from al-Assad's control but keep al-Assad himself in power amid an ongoing civil war. While the administration has provided non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition, it has stopped short of supplying weapons and ammunition called for by McCain and other critics. In his speech, Obama said there was no military solution to the Syrian civil war, and added that he will ""work with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and a brutal dictator."" National Security Adviser Susan Rice told CNN that sending weapons and ammunition to Syrian opposition groups would need ""the authority and blessing of Congress."" Earlier, Secretary of State John Kerry defended U.S. policy for Syria, including the deal struck to get chemical weapons out of the country. Speaking to CNN's ""New Day,"" he said he found it difficult to believe that critics would have preferred a military strike and hurting the al-Assad regime temporarily. He said that 92% of Syria's chemical weapons have been removed, and the other 8% are under control, waiting to be removed. ""It's remarkable to me that people simply want to refuse to accept that we're better off getting all of the weapons out than striking for one or two days and doing damage to some of them,"" Kerry said. McCain argued that the result of the administration's response meant that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad consolidated his grip on power, Hezbollah fighters and Iran's Revolutionary Guard were helping him out, Russia was increasing support for his regime and the war has become ""a  regional conflict and a tragedy of monumental proportions for which we will pay a heavy price in years to come."" Critics of Obama's foreign policy also have said the President's clear assertion that military force is off the table in Ukraine sends the wrong message to other countries -- namely China -- that have their own territorial disputes with neighbor states. The United States and its allies have imposed economic sanctions on Russia for its incursion into Ukraine, though that step hasn't done much to quiet the arguments coming from Obama's detractors. On Wednesday, Obama reiterated his policy that the United States will used military force, ""unilaterally if necessary,"" when its people are threatened, its livelihood is at stake or allies are in danger, but he said the threshold was higher when global issues ""do not pose a direct threat"" to the nation. ""In such circumstances, we should not go it alone,"" he said. ""Instead, we must mobilize allies and partners to take collective action. We have to broaden our tools to include diplomacy and development; sanctions, isolation; appeals to international law and -- if just, necessary, and effective -- multilateral military action."" Such a collective approach ""is more likely to succeed, more likely to be sustained, and less likely to lead to costly mistakes,"" Obama said. Obama last spoke broadly about his foreign policy during a trip to Asia in April, defending himself against those who say his policy lacks a discernible direction. ""You hit singles; you hit doubles; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run,"" Obama said in Manila, lashing out at those who argue for greater use of military force in conflicts abroad. ""Why is it that everyone is so eager to use military force?"" he asked then. ""After we have just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and our budget. And what is it exactly that these critics would have accomplished?"" According to aides, Obama's West Point speech kicks off a broader foreign policy push that will carry into his upcoming trip to Europe that includes a G7 summit in Brussels and a visit to Poland, designed to reassure Eastern European allies after Russia's intervention in Ukraine.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Wearing red jail coveralls and grim expressions, two suspects who authorities believe are responsible for a string of church fires in east Texas appeared in court Monday. Jason Robert Bourque, 19, and Daniel George McAllister, 21, are charged with one count of arson each in connection with a fire set at Dover Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas, on February 8. The blaze was one of 10 church fires in east Texas this year. Nine have been ruled arson. Authorities said Sunday they believe Bourque and McAllister are responsible for the deliberately set blazes. Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters the two are also suspects in attempted break-ins at three churches earlier this month. The single charge is a first-degree felony, punishable upon conviction by up to 99 years in prison, District Court Judge Christi Kennedy told McAllister on Monday. McAllister communicated with Kennedy mainly by nodding and shaking his head during the appearance Monday, but told her he and his family do not have money to hire an attorney. Kennedy appointed an attorney for him. Bourque gave soft answers to Kennedy's questions. He appeared with an attorney and did not need one appointed for him. Kennedy continued the $10 million bond for both, who acknowledged they understood the charge against them. A federal law enforcement source told CNN that multiple pieces of evidence have been linked to one of the suspects through DNA, and that many of the fires were ignited the same way. Bourque and McAllister are former members of First Baptist Church in Ben Wheeler, Texas, church pastor Carlton Young told CNN affiliate KLTV. ""Daniel was a very quiet young man,"" Young said. ""Jason, at that time, was a little mischievous."" He told KLTV that he lives next door to the church and several years ago, his wife spotted Bourque and McAllister going into the church one night after midnight. Both had backpacks on, he said. They went into a side door of the church and emerged about an hour later with lollipops in their mouths. Young said nothing was broken or taken and he did not think anything suspicious about the incident. David McAllister, Daniel's father, also spoke to KLTV. He said his son was ""a good kid,"" but his behavior began to change following the death of his mother about three years ago. ""In the last couple of weeks, I had that feeling that something was not quite right,"" the elder McAllister told the station. He said he had even suspected his son might have something to do with the fires until authorities released sketches of three people earlier this month. The sketches, he said, did not resemble his son. KLTV reported that Bourque's family declined to comment, saying only that the situation ""was in God's hands."" Bourque occasionally attended youth Bible studies at Christ Central Church in Lindale, Texas, church member Austin Johnson told KLTV. He said Bourque was ""brilliant"" and ""very kind"" and was very knowledgeable about the Bible. ""Expecting him to do something like this would have never crossed my mind,"" Johnson said. Investigators first became aware of the suspects about two weeks ago, and had been trying since then to build a case against them, said Thomas Crowley, special agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A call from a tip hotline led to the arrests, the bureau has said. Crowley had no information on a possible motive, but said authorities have been interviewing the two since their arrest.","Jason Robert Bourque and Daniel George McAllister face 99 years .

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI called for peace amid ongoing conflicts in Africa and the Middle East and mentioned the plight of those in Japan during his annual Easter message Sunday. The pope singled out Libya, saying, ""may diplomacy and dialogue take the place of arms and may those who suffer as a result of the conflict be given access to humanitarian aid."" Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have been battling rebels for control of parts of Libya ever since protests erupted in the country in February. Demonstrators first rallied against high unemployment and a delay in a government housing project, but they eventually called for an end to Gadhafi's four decades in power -- a protest that erupted into war. The pope also urged the restoration of ""peaceful coexistence"" in Ivory Coast, where a long-running political stalemate led to violence that forced nearly a million people into the main city of Abidjan and left hundreds dead, according to aid groups. The standoff only recently ended after President Alassane Ouattrara assumed power. The former president, Laurent Gbagbo, had refused to step down after he lost the election last year. ""There is an urgent need to tread the path of reconciliation and pardon in order to heal the deep wounds caused by the recent violence,"" the pope said in reference to the West African nation. ""In the countries of northern Africa and the Middle East, may all citizens, especially young people, work to promote the common good and to build a society where poverty is defeated and every political choice is inspired by respect for the human person,"" the pope said. ""May help come from all sides to those fleeing conflict and to refugees from various African countries who have been obliged to leave all that is dear to them; may people of good will open their hearts to welcome them, so that the pressing needs of so many brothers and sisters will be met with a concerted response in a spirit of solidarity; and may our words of comfort and appreciation reach all those who make such generous efforts and offer an exemplary witness in this regard."" Finally, the pope said he hoped Japan would find ""consolation and hope"" in the aftermath of the March earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis, ""along with other countries that in recent months have been tested by natural disasters which have sown pain and anguish.""","Pope Benedict XVI delivers his annual Easter message .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States believes that North Korea is supplying Iran with long-range missiles, suggesting Iran has strike capabilities are stronger than discussed in public, according to one of the leaked U.S. diplomatic cables released Sunday. The issue was raised by American diplomats in a high level-meeting with their Russian counterparts in late 2009, but the Russians expressed doubt on the U.S. concern, according to the cable. The revelation is in one of the documents published by WikiLeaks, the online whistleblower website that began releasing a cache of more than 250,000 cables Sunday. The document, dated February 24 and labeled ""secret,"" details a meeting between the United States and Russia in which U.S. representatives expressed belief that North Korea supplied Iran with missiles. The cable cites the U.S. belief that 19 BM-25 missiles were shipped to Iran in 2005. According to Jane's, a weapons research company, the missiles are reported to have a range somewhere between 2,500 and 4,000 km (1,560 to 2,500 miles). The Russians expressed doubts about the claim, citing lack of evidence, the cable states. But the Americans countered that some countries have offered direct evidence, and said they would try to bring further evidence to future meetings. The United States believes that Iran wanted the missiles for the propulsion technology. But in an exchange described in the cable, U.S. and Russian officials debated whether North Korea even had the BM-25 missile at all, and the Russians asked whether the United States had any images of the missile. ""The U.S. did not, but noted that North Korea had paraded the missile through the streets of Pyongyang. Russia disagreed,"" the cable noted. The Russians countered that a review of the video of that parade showed a different video and ""the missile appears to be a myth."" In what the cable describes as a ""vigorous session of questions and answers"" discussing ballistic missile threats, Russia detailed its assessment of Iran's missile program, and the degree to which Russia believes these programs constitute threats that would require missile defense responses. The cable said Russia believes Iran's ""success"" is that it has created Shahab-3 missiles that can reach targets in the Middle East and southeastern Europe, but they cannot do substantial damage with conventional warheads. According to the cable, the Russian Defense Ministry's Evgeny Zudin said that although Iran can build prototypes of long-range systems, it lacks structural materials such as high-quality aluminum to do so, and it also does not have the materials necessary for the kind of mass production that would make it a security threat at the moment or in the near future. Russia believes although Iran might be able to begin a ballistic missile program with a 2,000- to 3000-mile (3,200-to 4,800-km) range after 2015, it does not see Iran moving in this direction. Russia has instead concluded that Iran's ballistic missile program is directed toward developing combat-ready missiles to address regional concerns, the cable states. ""In their analysis, the missile programs of Iran and the [North Koreans] are not sufficiently developed, and their intentions to use missiles against the U.S. or Russia are nonexistent, thus not constituting a ""threat"" requiring the deployment of missile defenses,"" the cable's author noted.","U.S. and Russian officials disagree on reported Iranian missile .

"(CNN) -- The mother of American hostage Abdul Rahman Kassig has sent a tweet appealing for a response from ISIS to the family's pleas for his life. Paula Kassig of Indianapolis posted the tweet Thursday on behalf of herself and her husband, Ed, saying, ""We have tried to contact you directly to plea for the life of our only son, Abdul Rahman Kassig, and have not received any response."" She requests ""instruction"" from the Sunni extremist group, which calls itself the Islamic State. ""Please tell us what more we can do so that Abdul Rahman may continue to serve and live his life in accordance with the laws of Islam."" Kassig has been held captive since being detained October 2013 on his way to Deir Ezzor, Syria, his family has said. Kassig, whose given name is Peter, converted to Islam while in captivity and started going by Abdul Rahman Kassig. Video killings . ISIS has sought to sow terror by releasing videos showing the killings of four captives -- American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. In the video showing Henning's killing, released October 3, the terrorists threatened to kill Kassig. That prompted a plea from his parents, who had maintained silence about his capture since he was taken hostage. ""We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe,"" the family said then. In the days after ISIS threatened Kassig, his parents pleaded with his captors to show mercy and free him. They released a YouTube video imploring them to ""use their power to let our son go."" 'How can we reach you?' His mother previously asked for information about her son in a tweet addressed to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ""I am an old woman, and Abdul Rahman is my only child,"" she wrote. ""My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you. How can we reach you?"" Kassig served with the U.S. Army in Iraq and returned to the Middle East as a medical worker. ""We each get one life and that's it. We get one shot at this and we don't get any do-overs, and for me, it was time to put up or shut up,"" he said in a 2012 interview with CNN. He joined the Army in 2006, deployed to Iraq the next year and was honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour. He returned to the United States, got married, then divorced and eventually decided to help victims of war in the Middle East. Kassig founded a nonprofit group to provide first-response humanitarian aid to Syrian refugees, his family has said. He ran it from a base in Turkey in 2013. ""I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse,"" he said in the 2012 interview. ""But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people's quality of life a little bit better.

"(CNN) -- The flood damage to Iowa crops could reach $3 billion, according to the state's agriculture secretary. Three pigs stand stranded on the roof of a building Friday in Oakville, Iowa. ""Right now, we have about 10 percent of our corn that has either been flooded out or not planted and about 20 percent of our [soy]beans,"" Bill Northey said Friday on ""Iowa Press,"" a public television show. ""We're seeing some beans go back in the ground, and if we were to lose that, if we weren't able to replant, that would be $2.5 billion, $3 billion -- a significant amount of damage,"" he said. He added that some of the remaining crops would probably have smaller yields. Flooding in several Midwestern states has killed two dozen people and injured 148, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and 35,000 to 40,000 people in several states have been displaced.  Watch an iReporter's chronicle of the floods » . ""I think some of this was absolutely uncontrollable,"" Northey said. ""If you are ready for every potential event that could happen once out of every hundred years or 500 years, you're probably not going to be able to be in business and make it on a normal year. So, some of this is just flat-out unpredictable,"" he said. In Iowa, where several rivers jumped their banks about a week ago, water covered city blocks, ruined homes and poured over acres of farmland. This week, residents are returning to homes, and officials are assessing damage as the floodwater moves downstream to add to the Mississippi River's flow. Despite the acres of flooded farmland in Iowa, ""there certainly are folks out there with good crops,"" Northey said. ""There's areas with good crops, and within all areas, there's folks with good crops and poor crops,"" he said. Flooding of some of the food processing facilities in Iowa also has a ""very significant"" impact on Iowa's agriculture, Northey said. ""We're just starting to hear some of those things, just starting to figure out. Those change markets, and in many cases those losses, if they are by flooding, in some cases those are not covered by insurance,"" he said. On Thursday, President Bush toured the flood-ravaged state by air. ""Obviously, to the extent that we can help immediately we want to help, and then plan for recovery,"" the president said at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ""You're exhausted; I understand that,"" he said. ""The good news is, the people in Iowa are tough-minded people. You'll come back better,"" he said. Iowa Gov.

"(CNN) -- Ralph Lauren's 2014 holiday ad campaign for its RRL line was raked over the coals on social media this week for its ""assimilation aesthetic,"" featuring what appear to be antique photos of stoic Native Americans dressed in Western attire. Now, the company is apologizing for the imagery and has since removed the images from its website. ""Ralph Lauren has a longstanding history in celebrating the rich history, importance and beauty of our country's Native American heritage,"" the company said in a statement. ""We recognize that some of the images depicted in the RRL look book may have caused offense and we have removed them from our website."" Ruth Hopkins, a contributor to the site Last Real Indians, took issue with the campaign's use of Native Americans, claiming that the imagery is not only ignorant, it's a harsh reminder of a time of extreme oppression, and even genocide, for the nation's indigenous people. ""What many people alive today fail to realize is Natives of the Assimilation Era wore western clothes because they were forced to do so,"" she wrote. The policy of cultural assimilation of Native Americans spanned roughly from the 1800s midway into the 20th century as a way to ""Americanize"" indigenous people through forced English education, sending children away to boarding schools and banning tribal religious traditions. Some policies were enforced through threat of violence. Hopkins urged the public to email the designer about their objections and to take the brand to task using the social media hash tag #BoycottRalphLauren. ""It's wrong for him to use the portraits of our ancestors for personal gain,"" she told CNN in an email. Taking Native American fashion 'Beyond Buckskin' and headdresses .

"Washington (CNN) -- Some say that the WikiLeaks document dump has embarrassed the United States government. Agreed -- it is probably no fun to be the U.S. official in charge of calling Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi to admit that our government noticed his Russian business dealings. But here's who really should be embarrassed: . • Those who pooh-poohed George W. Bush's ""axis of evil."" WikiLeaks confirms that Iran and North Korea have for years been sharing weapons technology. • Those who suggest that it's some ""Israel lobby"" or Jewish cabal that is driving the confrontation with Iran. WikiLeaks confirms that the region's Arab governments express even more anxiety than Israel about the Iranian nuclear weapons program. • Those who have condemned Israel for inspecting or impeding Red Crescent ambulances. WikiLeaks confirms that during the 2006 Lebanon war, Iran smuggled weapons to Hezbollah in Red Crescent vehicles, including ambulances. • Those who have appeased Red Crescent demands that Israel's Red Magen David be excluded from international Red Cross organizations. The Red Crescent has been thoroughly penetrated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and is regularly used as a tool of Iranian foreign policy. • Those who lamented that Israel's interception of the Turkish blockade-runner Mevi Marmara would alienate Turkey as a key U.S. ally: The U.S. government itself has for years regarded the Turkish government as trending on its own impetus toward anti-Western Islamist radicalism. • Those who look blank-faced at the origin of cyber-attacks on Google and other crucial U.S. networks. WikiLeaks documents U.S. awareness that at least one cyber-attack on Google was ordered at the highest levels of the Chinese government. This is not to deny that WikiLeaks has done enormous harm. The leakers or hackers or whoever it was who obtained and published this information have put individual lives at risk. Toby Harnden of the Telegraph notes that one of the released documents names a U.S. informant in the region. The document identifies him as a U.K.-educated engineer from a prominent pre-revolution Isfahan family who once owned a large factory in Iran and is a former national fencing champion of Iran, a former president of the Iran Fencing Association and a former vice president of an Azerbaijan sports association. Harnden aptly asks: How many such persons do you think are out there? But here's the ghastliest irony of the leak. If it was Julian Assange's intention to use information hacked from U.S. computer systems to protect Iran from U.S. military action, he has very likely massively failed at his own purpose. The leak makes military conflict between Iran and the United States more likely, not less. The leak has changed the political equation in ways that reduce the restraint on U.S. policy. Public opinion in all U.S.-allied countries can now see that the dread of the Iranian nuclear program is not some artificial emotion whipped up by Israel, but a widespread fear among Arab and European governments. It's Iran's Gulf neighbors who have begged most urgently that the United States hit Iran's nuclear sites. Iranian recklessness and duplicity has been widely publicized -- as has Iran's contemptuous rejection of all diplomatic approaches. President Obama's hand has been strengthened inside the United States. Members of Congress can see the intimate details of the administration's determined effort to restrain Iran by peaceful means. And they can see in equally intimate detail that the effort has failed, and failed entirely because of Iran's obduracy. If any doubt remains that a nuclear Iran would massively destabilize the region, WikiLeaks alleviates it: It's there in black and white, according to Israeli sources, that Saudi Arabia would seek a nuclear weapon. And it's a good question whether an increasingly anti-Western Turkey would likely soon pursue a nuclear weapon too. I am not saying that a U.S. attack on Iran has suddenly become likely. Just that it has become more politically feasible than it was 72 hours ago.

"(CNN) -- Major crimes usually shake us into action. A London fire that killed five women ultimately led to the creation of 999, a precursor to our own 911 emergency system. The rape and murder of Kitty Genovese, meanwhile, inspired the creation of the neighborhood crime watch system. Yet while the Sony Pictures Entertainment email breach is a different sort of crime, it is a crime nonetheless, and one that was perpetrated in a neighborhood where almost all of us are resident these days -- the Internet. So where is the anger? The letters to congressmen? Part of the reason is that the reporting has focused on celebrity feuds rather than the fact that what happened to Sony could happen to any of us -- emails of a personal nature allegedly being held ransom or released as payback. In fact, if you add up the number of victims of the most notable known breaches this year, it's clear that a troublingly high percentage of us will have had some sort of information hacked. The other reason is that few of us feel like we're paying a price for cyberbreaches -- companies that are hacked typically eat the costs, at times without even informing customers. But lost in the reporting is another fact: We are, in a very real sense, responsible for such attacks. Not simply because we are the audience for the hacker's seedy releases, but because we are the inadvertent moles that provide the hackers access to large computers networks. Hackers often enter networks through simple phishing attacks, attacks that these days are actually simpler but more insidious than the infamous Nigerian phishing scams. Now, instead of trying to persuade you to part with your money in exchange for a nonexistent financial windfall, emails from trusted sources ask you to check out a photograph, click on a hyperlink to an interesting story or enter your login on an official-looking webpage. Complying with any of these requests provides varying degrees of access to your devices and accounts, and it is these simple ruses that have been responsible for launching malware and ""backdoors"" that have ultimately compromised major networks. The apparent simplicity of these attacks conceals a sophisticated understanding of people's online behavior that is surprising even to the many academics who have spent years studying human behavior. The reality is that many of us fall for these scams because of our email habits. Simple actions such as frequently checking email or Facebook status updates have become part of the daily rituals of Internet use. The human brain overtime automates such routines, which leads to people clicking on hyperlinks, opening attachments and providing credentials without really paying attention to what they are doing. Smartphones and tablets have only exacerbated this. After all, smartphones, which the majority of us now use to access the Internet, are designed for media consumption, not deception detection. Their apps are programmed to optimize smaller screen sizes and restricted data-caps, often by reducing the prominence of elements such as a website's URL or a sender's email address that could highlight the deception. Throw into the mix the fact that many of us are accessing these devices while talking, texting or even driving, and it's hardly surprising that we don't notice something nefarious. Making things worse, even some people who suspect a deception open such emails anyway because of flawed assumptions about the security of their devices and operating systems. Others might report the intrusion to their employer, but the reporting either comes too late or is lost in organizational silos. This is not surprising -- there are so many different arms of federal and state governments, along with organizations such as the Anti-Phishing Work Group, that collect complaints and disseminate information on cyberattacks that it is hard to keep track of where to send details of a complaint, much less go through the process of finding a contact address. Besides, there is no incentive for reporting a suspicious email unless someone has actually become a victim of an attack, in which case, it is generally already too late. So, what can be done? A simpler fix would be to develop a single nationwide gateway -- an email address or a phone number similar to the 911 system -- where anyone suspicious of a cyberthreat can quickly report it. In addition, it would be a welcome development to see the proliferation of organizations akin to neighborhood watch groups -- cyberwatch groups, if you will -- where people can routinely report suspected attacks and receive immediate feedback. From Aurora to Regin and the Nigerian scam, most cyberintrusions are named after the codes written into them or the hacker's fake persona, which cedes power to the very people who perpetrate these crimes. Instead, wouldn't it be better to highlight the names of the people who help detect an attack? This would be just one way that we could encourage people to feel they are more invested in protecting our cyberinfrastructure. Ultimately, the Internet is an online extension of our own neighborhoods. It's time for us to take their protection just as seriously.","Public should be angered over Sony hacking, says Arun Vishwanath .

"RALEIGH, North Carolina (CNN) -- Men arrested last week on suspicion of plotting a ""violent jihad"" overseas had weapons, thousands of rounds of ammunition and $13,000 cash in their home, an FBI agent testified in court Tuesday. An FBI agent testified he considers Daniel Patrick Boyd and six others ""a risk of flight"" who should be denied bail. Also found at the home of Daniel Patrick Boyd and his sons were gas masks and a book that FBI special agent Michael Sutton called ""essentially our playbook to how we respond to acts of terrorism."" The seven men arrested last week should not be released on bail, he said. ""I think all of them are a risk of flight, your honor,"" Sutton testified, noting allegations that all the defendants had traveled overseas. All face charges of supporting terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder abroad. Authorities are seeking an eighth suspect in the case. Officials identified three of the men as U.S. native Daniel Patrick Boyd, 39 -- who had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan -- and Boyd's sons, Dylan Boyd, 22, also known as ""Mohammed,"" and Zakariya Boyd, 20. The four others are: Mohammad Omar Aly Hassan, also a U.S.-born citizen; Hysen Sherifi, identified as a native of Kosovo who is a legal permanent resident of the United States; and Ziyad Yaghi and Anes Subasic, both naturalized U.S. citizens. Sabrina Boyd -- the wife of Daniel Patrick Boyd and the mother of the two younger Boyds -- said last week the allegations against her family are false. ""I know that my husband and my sons are free of guilt,"" she told CNN on July 28, when they were arrested. ""I'm hopeful that the truth will come to light.""  Watch Sabrina Boyd state her family's innocence » . Sutton testified Tuesday that Daniel and Dylan Boyd were arrested in Durham, North Carolina. Both were carrying weapons, and had permits to do so. The arresting agent told Sutton that Daniel Boyd attempted ""to acquire his sidearm,"" and that Dylan Boyd ""failed to comply with their instruction and had to be subdued."" In a later interview, the younger Boyd told Sutton he had not gone for his gun. Five surreptitiously recorded audio tapes were played in the hearing, along with a cell phone video showing someone firing an AK-47. On a tape made in May 2009, the elder Boyd talks about getting the money needed to wage jihad and hitting Wells Fargo trucks and banks. He makes reference to how he had robbed a bank in Pakistan. In the search of the Boyd home the FBI says agents found: . • Several weapons; . • 27,000 rounds of ammunition, including some armor-piercing types; . • $13,000 in cash. In addition, Dylan Boyd had a deposit slip for $16,000; . • Four gas masks; . • A book called ""Emergency Response to Terrorism,"" which Sutton said would be useful to someone trying to counter law enforcement; . • A document described as a fatwa (Muslim religious edict) of jihad (holy war) against America. It includes the assertion that the killing of Americans and their allies ""is an individual duty for every Muslim."" • An old identification card. Sutton said an FBI linguist says it reads ""monotheism, jihad and power. ... No God but God. Mohammed is his messenger."" On the flip side it says that the carrier is allowed into a certain house alone but should surrender the card when leaving. They also found a trench under the deck of the house, which a witness told the FBI was a bunker to store and conceal weapons, and a plywood plank placed in a tree so that someone sitting there could see anyone approaching the house, according to Sutton. The indictment against the men makes no reference to a direct threat to individuals or property in the United States, but said the men had practiced military tactics in a North Carolina county that borders Virginia.","""I think all of them are a risk of flight, your honor,"" FBI agent Michael Sutton testified .

"It was billed as a clash between emerging jumps superstar Annie Power and one of the best staying hurdlers of all time, Big Buck's. But in the event, another up-and-comer, More Of That, spoiled the party by capturing the World Hurdle on the third day of the Cheltenham Festival. Victory extended trainer Jonjo O'Neill's record to three winners this week, while for jockey Barry Geraghty it was yet another winner on a horse that had been rejected by number one jockey A P McCoy -- he scored in the Champion Hurdle on Jezki on Wednesday. The perennial Champion Jockey, who suffered a horror fall here on Wednesday, plumped for At Fishers Cross, who could do no better than third.  11-8 favorite Annie Power ran a gallant race to finish second. The only mare in the race, Annie Power initially seemed to be overawed by the occasion, unaccustomed to the roar of a 60,000 capacity crowd in her ears. But she was soon settled by jockey Ruby Walsh and sat comfortably towards the back of the field. As the business end of the race approached, she was maneuvered to within striking distance of Big Buck's, but when it became apparent that the threat was going to come not from Sam Twiston-Davies's mount but from the J P McManus runners, At Fishers Cross and More of That, she was switched by Walsh to the outside. As the final flight loomed Annie Power and More Of That rose together but on the long run to the winning post More Of That was able to find greater reserves of stamina. Trainer O'Neill was full of praise for the six-year-old. ""We were very pleased with the horse and he was in great old form,"" O'Neill said. ""Jumping the last, I thought he would keep galloping. I had a little doubt in my mind that Annie Power might not quite get home but she gave us a fair fright."" Big Buck's had become virtually synonymous with this race, having won four of the last five editions (he missed 2013 through injury). Regarded by many as one of the best staying hurdlers of all time, Big Buck's had failed to make a fairy-tale comeback from injury this season and only managed fifth place today. The 11-year-old was immediately retired after this 40th race and took a victory lap of the parade ring to rapturous applause. A visibly moved Paul Nicholls, trainer of Big Buck's, concluded: ""You have got to be sensible and draw stumps at the right time and this is the right time.""

"(CNN)  -- Mexican smugglers trying to find new routes into the United States are turning increasingly to the Pacific Ocean for a short sail to the California coast, where they drop off illegal immigrants and marijuana, U.S. officials say. The Pacific Ocean around the California coastline is being used more often by Mexican smugglers. The water route has become particularly popular in the past year. ""We've seen a huge spike in smuggling by water,"" said Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in San Diego, California. ""It's become very, very risky and difficult to cross by land. Smugglers try to jump where they think we're not looking."" U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Farris, the top-ranking Coast Guard official at the Port of San Diego, said interdictions of human cargo on the Pacific have doubled since last year. Drug busts -- all marijuana -- are even higher, he said. ""Drug interdictions are six times above what they were last year,"" Farris told CNN Wednesday. So far this year, he said, authorities have confiscated 60,000 pounds of marijuana and caught 400 people trying to sneak into the United States. The water route has become popular, he said, because ""the land border has been so severely closed by Customs and border agents."" That land route was particularly difficult Tuesday for smugglers who tried to speed three vans full of illegal immigrants through the San Ysidro border crossing between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, California. San Ysidro is the busiest land border crossing in the world, with up to 45,000 cars and 95,000 people passing through each day. One Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and two Customs and Border Protection agents opened fire, wounding two suspects, officials said. Another two people were injured when one of the vans crashed into another vehicle. More than 70 people aboard the three vans were captured as were two of the drivers, authorities said. One driver ran back into Mexico and got away, officials said. The San Diego Police Department is investigating the shootings because they occurred within the city limits, said police Lt. Kevin Rooney. Tuesday's incident was the second shooting in less than a week in San Diego involving federal authorities. Two Border Patrol agents are under investigation after shooting at a smuggling suspect they believed was trying to run one of them over with a vehicle, Rooney said. That suspect also was wounded. Why anyone would try to run a heavily secured checkpoint in Tuesday's incident may be beyond comprehension to some people. Rooney said he understands. ""There's a sense of desperation that exists these days trying to get folks across the border,"" he said. ICE spokeswoman Mack said she was taken aback, particularly since San Ysidro has ""a major obstacle course,"" with speed bumps, concrete barricades, a gate and tire shredders. ""What was surprising,"" she said, ""was the brazen attempt in a very public area in the middle of the day, to assume that they could run the port of entry in today's world. ""That's not too smart,"" she added. ""What do they call that? Felony stupid?"" Mack and Angelica Decima, a spokeswoman for the Customs and Border Protection office in San Diego, have noticed another phenomena: young people taping drugs to their bodies and trying to walk across the border. Many of them are high school students, Mack said. They can make $200 to $300 for each trip, said Decima. But it's the Pacific route that has become more common -- and increasingly dangerous, officials say. Smugglers often use small fishing boats known as pangas, Mack said. Usually 19 to 28 feet in length, smugglers will load them up with illegal immigrants to the point the vessels become dangerous. ""We've seen them pretty packed,"" Mack said. ""They cram them in there just like they cram them in the vans."" There's another danger, she said. ""We've noticed that violent tactics have increased, particularly in the water,"" Mack said. ""We've seen an increase in the type of violent tactics these smuggling groups are using. That's a clear sign of desperation."" Tuesday's incident at San Ysidro left thousands of cars stopped on the road for hours when U.S. authorities closed all 24 northbound lanes into the country. The five southbound lanes into Mexico remained open. Witnesses described a chaotic scene with officers yelling at the vans as they sped away and then drawing their weapons and firing. ""I was crossing the bridge, and I started hearing all this gunfire,"" Michael Casilla told CNN affiliate XETV. ""I saw a couple officers shooting at the van, and I saw a couple of lights fly out. A couple tried to run out (of a van) and they got swarmed by all the Customs agents."" Another motorist might have been too close for comfort. ""This officer was yelling at this blue van that was heading north,"" the unidentified witness told CNN affiliate KGTV. ""He had his gun in his hand, obviously. He yelled at them and they didn't stop. I heard two or three gunshots and at that point in time, I went to the floor."" Border officials opened up eight lanes a couple of hours after the incident, Decima said. But it took a few more hours for all lanes to be opened.

"Despite calls for a new cease-fire, fighting intensified in Gaza on Monday and Tuesday morning, with Palestinians saying more than two dozen people died as rockets or mortars struck a refugee camp, a hospital and the center of Gaza City. Eighteen people died as powerful and continuous air strikes rained down on Gaza City early Tuesday morning, the Palestinian Health Authority reported. And the Israeli military reported that 10 of its soldiers were killed Monday. Al Aqsa TV reported that Israeli strikes hit the Ministry of Finance in western Gaza and the house of Ismail Haniyeh, a senior political leader of Hamas.  A radio station run by Hamas was bombed. Ten people, including eight children, were killed Monday when shells hit a refugee camp near the beach in Gaza where parents went to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, a Muslim holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, the Gaza Health Ministry said. The children were playing in the street near their homes when an explosion shook the ground. Holes as large as fists pockmarked a nearby building, and 10 people -- eight of them children -- were killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. In the chaos, they were rushed to nearby Shifa Hospital. A TV news outlet run by Hamas showed live footage of the hospital. The channel blamed the carnage on an Israeli drone. Shifa Hospital had been hit, too. Two people there were injured, the ministry said. As before, Israel and Hamas accused each other of sending the bombs that killed people in Gaza. A short time later, Israel sent a text message to the media blaming Gaza ""terrorists"" for the attacks. ""In the blink of an eye,"" a father said, ""I found body parts and heads cut off, no arms, no legs. I started to collect limbs, heads I couldn't recognize, I couldn't recognize my own children."" Though world leaders pleaded for a humanitarian cease-fire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a message on Israeli television Monday. ""We need to be prepared for a protracted campaign in Gaza,"" he said. Calling life under the threat of death ""inconceivable"" for Israel, Netanyahu said the military will not end its incursion into Gaza until it has destroyed tunnels Hamas is using to attack civilians outside Gaza. Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said Israel will not negotiate while Hamas is still attacking. ""We will not hesitate to expand our operation,"" he said. Deaths in Israel, too . Ten Israeli soldiers were killed Monday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Five were killed fighting militants who tried to attack Israeli civilians using a tunnel shaft leading to the Nahal Oz community, the IDF said. Israeli soldiers stopped the attempted attack, killing one of the attackers, the military said. One Israeli soldier died in combat in southern Gaza. And another four were killed and eight were injured by mortar fire near Beeri, close to the Israeli-Gaza border, the IDF said. Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for Gaza health ministry, said 1,101 people have been killed and more than 6,500 wounded in Gaza since the current conflict began. A total of 53 Israeli soldiers have died. The tunnels . A central goal of Israel's military is to destroy tunnels that Hamas uses to smuggle weapons and launch attacks. CNN's ""New Day"" asked chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat what the purpose of the tunnels were. ""I know the situation is so much complex -- I'm not saying I know the picture as a whole,"" he responded. But, he said, Gaza is now like a burning building. ""We need to get the people out, and then we need to extinguish the fire, and then we sit down and talk."" Erakat called for Israel to pull troops out of Gaza. Israel isn't acting in self-defense, he said. ""They're the occupying power. They should be responsible for the human lives there."" Erakat said U.N. figures show ""90% of those killed are women and children."" It was unclear what he was basing those figures on. The United Nations estimates that more than 70% of the Palestinians killed were civilians, including 226  youths and 117  women. More than 150 were members of armed groups, the United Nations says. UNICEF said Monday that about two-thirds of the children killed were 12 or younger. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths, saying militants encourage people to stay in their homes despite Israeli warnings that strikes are coming. Militants also use civilian facilities such as homes, schools, mosques and hospitals to launch attacks on Israeli civilians and store weapons. Calls, hopes for peace . The Gaza crisis was discussed Monday in a joint call involving U.S. President Barack Obama. British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela  Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. A statement from Cameron's office said the leaders agreed on ""the urgent need for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and Israel, backing the efforts of the Egyptian government to achieve this."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry returned to Washington after a trip to the Middle East and Paris, where he held discussions in an attempt to calm the violence. His efforts were criticized by Israeli media and Palestinian leaders. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday night that he was concerned the IDF had dropped leaflets in the northern Gaza Strip,  warning thousands of residents to leave their homes and evacuate to Gaza City. If true, this would have a ""devastating humanitarian impact"" on Gaza residents, he said. At a midnight meeting, the U.N. Security Council proclaimed its support for ""a comprehensive peace based on the vision of a region where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace with secure and recognized borders as envisioned in Security Council resolution 1850 (2008)."" That fell short of Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour's desires. He wanted the body to pass a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. ""The equation is simple,"" Israeli Ambassador Ron Prosor said. ""When it is quiet in Israel, it will be quiet in Gaza."" Obama had another phone conversation with Netanyahu on Sunday, reiterating concern about the rising Palestinian civilian deaths, Israeli deaths and the ""worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza."" Israel: We're not responsible for last week's school deaths . The Israeli military said it was not responsible for anyone killed last week when an ""errant Israeli mortar"" hit the courtyard of a U.N. school that was shelter to many Gaza residents. U.N. and Palestinian officials said 16 people were killed and hundreds were wounded Thursday when the school in northern Gaza was struck. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said militants had fired anti-tank missiles from the immediate area of the school, and the IDF fired several mortar shells back in that direction. ""A single errant Israeli mortar landed in the courtyard in the school,"" Lerner said. ""The footage we have shows the courtyard was empty."" ""We reject the claim that people were killed by the IDF mortar on the school premises,"" he added. But Lerner said there could have been people who were wounded by shrapnel. Israeli government spokesman, Mark Regev said, ""The question is who is responsible, and for that we have to look at seriously and judiciously and make sure we get to the truth."" A CNN team that visited the shelter several hours after the mortar attack saw evidence that people were badly wounded at the courtyard. The team saw blood and strewn possessions concentrated close to the edge of the courtyard along the wall of the building, the area that would have been shady around 3 p.m. when the school was hit. The IDF released a high-altitude aerial video of the round hitting the school, but it did not have high resolution and it is impossible to tell if anybody was sitting on the courtyard edge.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has named one of its newest ships after Mexican-American labor organizer Cesar Chavez, officials said Wednesday. The decision was an ideal fit for the latest in the Lewis and Clark class of ships, which bear the names of legendary pioneers and explorers, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus said in a statement. ""Cesar Chavez inspired young Americans to do what is right and what is necessary to protect our freedoms and our country,"" he said. ""The Cesar Chavez will sail hundreds of thousands of miles and will bring support and assistance to thousands upon thousands of people. His example will live on in this great ship."" In 1962, Chavez founded the National Farm Workers Association, which grew into the United Farm Workers. He has been widely honored for turning the spotlight on the plight of farm workers, helping bring them better pay and safer working conditions. Chavez died in 1993. Former President Bill Clinton posthumously presented Chavez with the Medal of Freedom a year later. Chavez was a Navy veteran and apparently had mixed feelings about the experience. ""In 1944 he joined the Navy at the age of 17,"" his official biography on the United Farm Workers website says. ""He served two years and in addition to discrimination, he experienced strict regimentation."" Workers at a shipyard in San Diego are building the 689-foot ship, which can carry up to two helicopters and will be used to transport ammunition, food, fuel, repair parts and other items. Other ships in the Navy's T-AKE class of dry cargo and ammunition ships are named for innovators like aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart and Antarctic explorer Richard Byrd. But at least one lawmaker released a statement criticizing the Navy's decision to add Chavez to the roster. ""This decision shows the direction the Navy is heading,"" said Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. ""Naming a ship after Cesar Chavez goes right along with other recent decisions by the Navy that appear to be more about making a political statement than upholding the Navy's history and tradition."" Hunter sent a letter to Mabus on Wednesday, requesting the Navy name its next available vessel after Marine Corps Sgt. Rafael Peralta, who the congressman said ""showed an even greater pioneering spirit when he led a team of Marines into a house in Fallujah, Iraq."" Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, praised the Navy's decision, noting that Chavez ""worked tirelessly to promote fair working conditions and equal rights for all Americans."" As several family members of Chavez and Navy officials honored the ship at a ceremony in San Diego Wednesday afternoon, several Latinos in California said they were happy to hear the news. ""He was a man who fought ... for the welfare of all American workers. It will be an enormous recognition, and not to do so would say a lot,"" Felix Rodriguez said. Los Angeles resident Maria Barrientos said she agreed. ""I think the people who don't want it, maybe it's because they have never suffered ... or never have fought as he did, and I think it's very good to honor him. I feel very proud to be Latina like him,"" she said. CNN's Jaqueline Hurtado in Los Angeles and Senior National Security Producer Charley Keyes in Washington contributed to this report.","Navy officials named the ship in an official ceremony in San Diego .

"Paris (CNN) -- Seven children are seriously ill in the French city of Lille after an E. Coli outbreak linked to frozen ground beef, French health authorities said Thursday. All seven, aged from 18 months to 8 years old, are being treated in a hospital for hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) -- a form of kidney failure related to a rare form of E. Coli -- according to the Nord-Pas-de-Calais regional health agency. The infection is not thought to be linked to a recent deadly E. Coli outbreak centered in Germany. The children are in a ""serious"" condition but their lives are not in danger, local media reports say. French health agency spokesman Joelle Perrin said in a televised press conference that the strand of E. Coli was not the same as that found in German bean sprouts. The German outbreak has led to nearly 3,350 cases of HUC, resulting in 37 deaths as of June 14, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all those cases were in people who had travelled to or lived in Germany. French regional health authorities have identified frozen ground beef sold in Lidl stores under the brand Steaks Country as linked to the infections in Lille. They have asked the manufacturer, SEB, to recall boxes of ground beef with sell-by dates of May 10-12, 2012. SEB has not yet issued a statement on the recall. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","All the children affected have cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome, a form of kidney failure, related to E. Coli infection .

"The Transportation Security Administration is unveiling new technology this month at several airports aimed at verifying boarding passes and IDs of passengers. A total of 30 machines from three different companies will be tested at Dulles International Airport near Washington, George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and the San Juan airport in Puerto Rico. Dulles received the first of the machines and began rolling them out Wednesday. ""We feel that this technology is a step up from the current technology we are using today,"" said Domenic Bianchini, director of TSA's checkpoint technology. Each company's machine looks different, has different software and uses different algorithms, but for passengers they all operate in a similar way. Travelers approaching the credential authentication system scan their boarding pass bar code on the front of a large computer-equipped podium. They then give the boarding pass and their identification to a TSA employee who puts it in a scanner. The computer scans the materials and checks to make sure such security features as holograms and bar codes are present. The passengers' information from the ID and boarding pass is displayed on the computer screen, along with their photo scanned from their ID. The machine compares all the data collected from the front and back of the ID and the boarding pass. If everything matches, the TSA agent is then prompted to allow the passenger to proceed. ""If there aren't any alerts at all, basically it's a green light,"" Bianchini said. ""They will process the individual and ask them to proceed to the checkpoint."" If the data doesn't match, agents are able to look at screens showing the information scanned and identify where there is a discrepancy and potentially find a fraudulent ID or boarding pass. ""We'll be able to look and see what specific security feature may have caused an alert and that allows the officer to focus their attention in a specific area,"" Bianchini said. Bianchini said he is not aware of any fraudulent documents found so far. One TSA employee at Dulles said he found an apparent mistake by a state which issued a passenger's driver's license that provided one gender on the front and another gender in the bar code on the back of the license. TSA spokespeople asked the employee to stop relaying that story, and would not comment on how the devices have worked since being deployed at Dulles. The machines do not save the information collected once the agent clears the data to advance to the next passenger, according to the TSA, and passenger data is not checked against any watch lists or other databases. The devices are designed to check documents in a ""matter of seconds,"" Bianchini said. TSA officials would not specify any predicted time it will take passengers to go through the machine, or if it would take longer than the traditional manual ID check currently in place. ""We don't have data with passengers at this point,"" said TSA spokesman Greg Soule, noting it was a pilot program. CNN timed a handful of passengers going through one machine at the Dulles checkpoint Friday. Most people spent about 30 seconds at the machine, however the TSA agent operating it had to call over another agent several times for help. One passenger spent more than a minute and a half at the machine; another spent two and a half minutes. ""We are getting that first experience. Then, over time, we hope to see more familiarity with that technology and faster processing,"" Bianchini said. The initial pilot machines cost about $3.2 million, or a little more than $100,000 each. The program deals only with document checkers that passengers encounter at the entrance to the checkpoint.  It does not change the existing screening inside, including metal detectors, body scanners and X-ray machines. The pilot program is scheduled to expand to Houston on Tuesday and San Juan on April 23 and is expected to last several months. ""Once the testing is complete, TSA will make a final determination if we can roll out one or more of these technologies into the airports,"" Bianchini said. ""The intent is to have a system like this at every airport checkpoint in the country.""","The pilot program is aimed at verifying boarding passes and IDs of passengers .
