"We usually think of robots as an achievement of the modern era. But this remarkable machine is proof that the resourceful inventors of the 19th Century had the technology to create their own automata. Not only that, its remarkable gold and diamond-studded design shows they had the imagination to create them with far more style than our functional modern versions. Steampunk eat your heart out: This incredible jewel-studded caterpillar that shows how the robot makers of the 19th Century had far more style than those building the functional machines of today . Thought to date back as far as 1820, this incredible pre-electronic mechanical robot was made by Swiss watchmaker Henri Maillardet for sale to aristocratic Chinese buyers. The rare gold, enamel, jewel and pearl-set automaton mimics the gracious undulating caterpillar's crawl with a clockwork powered mechanism which drives a pair of gilt-metal knurled wheels. It was titled 'the Ethiopian caterpillar' when Maillardet, in partnership with legendary watchmaker Jaquet Droz, organized an exhibition to show off his menagerie of miniaturised automata in London, which dazzled the public. According to Sotheby's, which handled the last sale of the caterpillar in 2010, it has also been referred to as the 'Vers de soie' - meaning 'silkworm' - and very likely may have been destined for the court of Qianlong. Of Maillardet's caterpillar robots only six are known to exist and five are in prestigious collections in Europe, including one in the Patek Philippe museum and another two in the Sandoz collection. Clever: The rare gold, enamel, jewel and pearl-set automaton mimics the gracious undulating caterpillar's crawl with a clockwork powered mechanism which drives a pair of gilt-metal knurled wheels . Born 1745, Maillardet was a Swiss mechanician who worked in London producing clocks and other mechanisms, including various automata, including a famous set depicting magicians and others which could write in French and English. The motions of these latter robots, which also drew pictures, were by a series of cams located on shafts in the base, with what is believed to be the largest cam-based memory of any automaton of the era. When one was presented to Philadelphia's Franklin Institute in 1928 it was of unknown origin; but once restored to working order, the robot itself provided the answer by penning the words 'written by the automaton of Maillardet'. The Ethiopian Caterpillar was sold at Sotheby's Geneva auction room in 2010 and was snapped up for $415,215 by an Asian buyer. The auctioneers said in a statement: 'The body realistically designed to represent a caterpillar comprising eleven jointed ring segments, framed by seed pearls, and decorated with translucent red enamel over an engine-turned ground, studded overall with gold-set rubies, turquoise, emeralds,and diamonds. 'The underside is decorated with champlevé black enamel. When the automaton movement is engaged, the caterpillar crawls realistically, its body moving up and down simulating the undulations of a caterpillar by means of a set of gilt-metal knurled wheels. 'The automata work is composed of a barrel, cam and two leavers all working together to create the crawling motion.'","Caterpillar uses clockwork to mimic the motion of its real-life equivalent .

"As the outcry continues after the anti-Putin Pussy Riot singers were . jailed for two years over a 50-second cathedral protest, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov was arrested for his protestations outside the court. After today's staggering news, leader of the opposition, the mild-mannered Kasparov was shown in forceful terms that the the Russian security forces are clamping down on unrest. The pictures clearly show Kasparov being manhandled by the Russian police as a growing clamour of disbelief begins to spread at the severe sentencing. Scroll down video . About 20 people have been arrested outside the court since the start of the judgement,  including former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, (pictured) now an opposition political figure . Arrested: Police officers detain former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, a leading opposition activist, outside the court . In you go: The detaining of Kasparov shows the hard line the Russian security forces are taking . Kasparov behind bars: The Pussy Riot trial has drawn international outrage as an emblem of Russia's intolerance of dissent . Flashback: Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, right, in action against Indian Viswanathan Anand during the Linares Chess Tournament in 2005 . In what many viewed as a ‘show trial’, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, and Maria Alyokhina, 24, who both have children, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 30, sat behind a glass wall as Judge Marina  Syrova convicted them of ‘hooliganism motivated by religious hatred’. In a  judgement lasting almost two hours, the judge – who has only once given a not guilty verdict in 179 hearings – ruled that the trio showed ‘clear disrespect to society’ by staging their ‘Punk Prayer’ in Moscow’s biggest cathedral on February 21 when they belted out a raucous chorus calling on the Virgin Mary to ‘drive out Putin’. Time to reflect: The Pussy Riot band members show the court's written verdict as they sit in a glass cage surrounded by the world's media . They had offended the feelings of Orthodox believers, she added, before sentencing them to ‘two years deprivation of  liberty in a penal colony’. The verdict – which could see them sent to Siberian labour camps – is likely to spark a weekend of protest in Russia and in cities around the world. Their two years will count from their arrest so they can expect releases in March 2014 unless pardoned by Putin. But Russian dissident and blogger Alexei Navalny said: ‘They are in jail because it is Putin’s personal revenge. ‘This verdict was written by Vladimir Putin.’ Undaunted: Sitting together, Yekaterina Samutsevich (left ), Maria Alyokhina (centre) and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova smiled as the guilty verdict was read out . The women, two of whom have young children, were charged with hooliganism connected to religious hatred but the case is widely seen as a warning that authorities will only tolerate opposition under tightly controlled conditions . On trial: The three women are escorted before the court hearing today in Moscow . Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, right, are led into the court wearing handcuffs . In London a fortnight ago for the Olympics, Putin had said the women ‘should not be judged too severely’. Yesterday calls were starting for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Russian city of Sochi. While the sentence for ‘hooliganism motivated by religious hatred’ was relatively light compared with the seven-year maximum, the case is widely seen as a ‘show trial’ warning to others daring to challenge Putin’s ‘authoritarian rule’. The trio had expected no mercy for their political protest. Tolokonnikova said shortly before the verdict, which she assumed was written in the Kremlin: ‘I do not believe in this court. There is no court. It is an illusion.’ Russian opposition leader Kasparov, the former chess world champion, was one of dozens arrested outside the court in a huge security clampdown. A topless women's rights activist hacked down a . Christian cross in the Ukrainian capital Kiev with a chain saw on Friday . in protest at the prosecution of the Russian feminist punk band, Pussy . Riot . Later there were claims he was beaten but also that he bit a policeman, which could mean he will face charges. The US denounced the sentences as ‘disproportionate’. Western campaigners were led by Sir Paul McCartney and Madonna in the run-up to the trial. Yesterday Amnesty International dubbed  the court’s ruling a ‘bitter blow’ to freedom of expression in Russia. In London, around 50 people gathered at the Royal Court theatre in a show of support for the women. Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said: ‘I am deeply concerned by the sentencing of three members of the band Pussy Riot, which can only be considered a disproportionate response to an expression of political belief.’ Supporters of feminist punk group Pussy Riot stand behind barricades surrounding a court, in Moscow, Russia .

"A 20-year-old ex-college football player is facing a felony stalking charge for disobeying a court order to stay away from David Geffen. Jamie Kuntz was arrested in October and is accused of following, harassing and making a 'credible threat' against the 71-year-old billionaire philanthropist and music mogul between September 14 and November 14. But Kuntz's lawyer claims there was no stalking, just crossed wires after Geffen ended the affair with the upset younger man and then followed that up with a restraining order according to TMZ. The one-time football hopeful is due in a Los Angeles court on Wednesday and made headlines in 2012 when he was taken off the North Dakota State College of Science team when he was caught on video kissing his then 65-year-old boyfriend in the press box during a game. Court intervention: Billionaire David Geffen, 71, has filed a restraining order against 20-year-old ex-college football player Jamie Kuntz . Posing: Jamie Kuntz was a promising college football player in North Dakota before he allegedly became involved in an affair with David Geffen . Multi-billionaire Geffen has been single since he split with his 28-year-old lover, Jeremy Lingvall in February 2012. Despite a six-year relationship that included public visits to the White House in 2009 to meet President Obama, the pair parted ways because, 'the relationship had simply run its course.' When the two began dating, Lingvall was attacked by some gay commentators and blogs for using Geffen as a 'sugar daddy' - because of their 41-year age difference. Lingvall, now 30, is a surfer and graduate of the University of California Santa Barbara, although on a social networking website he described it as ‘The University of Casual Sex and Booze’. On his Friendster profile he also bragged about ‘making hot girls swoon just to piss off straight guys’. Once in Geffen’s life, however, Lingvall became a indispensable part of it - and accompanied him everywhere. He and Geffen would also spend days on the latter’s two yachts including the 453-foot yacht ‘Rising Sun’ he bought from Oracle founder Larry Ellison in 2010. Worth $6.8 billion, Geffen owns $1 billion in Apple stock and made his money with Asylum Records and later Geffen Records, launching The Eagles, Aerosmoth and Guns N' Roses. In 1990 he sold Asylum for $550 million and founded DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenbury, after raising $2 billion in capital in one week. Geffen also owns the 377-foot ‘Pelorus’ he bought from Russian billionaire Roman Abramovitch for a reported $300 million. During their six-year relationship Lingvall enjoyed a life of private planes, yachts, parties and mansions with David Geffen . Powerful: Jeremy Lingvall was treated to a trip to the White House in 2009 where he met President Barack Obama and posted the picture to Facebook . Investment: In 2011 Geffen added to his maritime collection when he reportedly purchased one of Roman Abramovich's yachts, the 377-foot Pelorus, for $300million . The Pelorus, or ‘vast’ in English, boasts two helicopter pads, a swimming pool, an owner’s suite with 180-degree panoramic views and a staff of around 40 on duty to cater to its owner’s whims. Music industry legend Geffen is known for his passion for art and supposedly has one of the best collections of post-war American art in the world. In 2006 he sold two of his paintings for $143.5million, one by Jasper Johns and another by De Kooning. But it was back in September, 2012, Kuntz caused a minor national controversy when he was kicked off the team after his gay clinch. Movers and shakers: Some of his enormous wealth came from Dreamworks, which Geffen co-founded in 1994 with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg . Geffen, here with Bill Clinton in 2000, is a longtime fundraising force for Democrats and is friends with the former president and his wife, Hilary . He ended up having to leave the college in Wahpeton, which he attended on a partial football scholarship. At the the tiome, North Dakota State College of Sciences said he was disciplined and remove from the team but it was not because he was gay - it was because he lied about his gay kiss. Kuntz and his 65-year-old boyfriend were in the press box at the game against Snow College in Pueblo, Colorado over the 2012 Labor Day weekend. Kuntz was videotaping the game for the team when the 'the kiss just happened', he says. 'People around here aren't exposed to it,' Mr Kuntz said of homosexuality. 'People expect gays to be flamboyant, not football players.' A teammate apparently saw the kiss and told coaches, Mr Kuntz said. Dismissed: Jamie left North Dakota State College of Sciences in Wahpeton which he attended on a partial football scholarship . When Mr Parsons confronted Mr Kuntz on the bus ride back to North Dakota, he told him the man he kissed was his grandfather. 'I lied,' Mr Kuntz said. Later, he felt guilty about lying and came clean to his coach. In a September 3 dismissal letter Mr Parsons told Mr Kuntz he was being ousted from the team under the 'conduct deemed detrimental to the team' category outlined in guidelines in the team's player's manual. Mr Parsons specifically noted the manual's section on 'lying to coaches, teachers or other school staff.' 'This decision was arrived at solely on the basis of your conduct during the football game; and because you chose not to be truthful with me when I confronted you about whom else was in the box with you,' Parsons wrote. 'Any conduct by any member of the program that would cause such a distraction during a game would warrant the same consequences.' Mr Kuntz doesn't believe he was dismissed just for lying. 'I know if it was a girl in the press box, or even an older woman, nothing would have happened,' he said. 'If it was an older woman, I would have probably been congratulated for it from my teammates.'","Music mogul, 71, filed restraining order against 20-year-old in September .

"A video captures the moment Deborah Milke hugs her terminally ill mother for the first time in more than two decades after being released from death row. For 23 years the only contact the mother and daughter have had has been through a perspex window, as contact is not allowed between visitors and inmates on death row. But, as 49-year-old Milke was released as she awaits retrial for the murder of her four-year-old son, she was able to embrace her mother in an emotional reunion. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Debra Milke, right, with her mother Renate Janka after her release . 'It feels so good to hug you,' Milke can be heard saying to Renate Janka in a video shown on AZ Central. Her mother responded by commenting on how nice it was to see her daughter wearing something other than the orange prison jumpsuit she had been in for 23 years. The first photo of Milke since her release was published on crimefilenews.com. She is reportedly staying in a Phoenix home provided by supporters. In the photo she is is shown wearing a colorful short-sleeved top and smelling a rose. Emotional: The mother and daughter are able to hug for the first time in 23 years . Together again: Renate commented on how nice it was to see Debra out of her orange prison suit . Free at last: After spending more than two decades on death row for the death of her 4-year-old son, Debra Milke is free and staying in a Phoenix home provided by supporters . Milke walked out of the Maricopa County Sheriff's jail on Friday after supporters posted her $250,000 bond. The . 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned her conviction in March, ruling . that prosecutors should have disclosed information that cast doubt on . the credibility of a now-retired detective who said Milke confessed to . being involved in the killing of her son, Christopher. Milke has not been exonerated, but a judge allowed her to go free while she prepares for a new trial in a case that made her one of Arizona's most reviled inmates. Milke was convicted in the death of her son who authorities believe was killed for a $5,000 insurance payout. Police said Milke dressed the boy in his favorite outfit in December 1989, telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a mall before handing him over to two men who took the child into the desert and shot him. She had been imprisoned since 1990. 'Death Row Debbie': Debra Milke was released from prison on Friday as she awaits a new trial in the 1989 murder of her son, Christopher . Doubt: The 9th Circuit agreed that there is some doubt about damning testimony given by a detective who single-handedly put Milke on death row . Prosecutors declined to comment on Milke's possible release and have not appealed the bond order. In court: Milke testifies during her trial in 1990 . Milke, . whose mother was a German who married a U.S. Air Force military . policeman in Berlin in the early 1960s, has drawn strong support from . citizens of that nation and Switzerland, neither of which has the death . penalty. Max Krucker, . former president of the Swiss community where Milke's mother now lives, . said Ms Janka was 'ecstatic'  her . daughter had been released. 'She . said, `Now I can finally hold my daughter in my arms again,'' he told . The Associated Press in a telephone interview from her home. For as long as Milke has been incarcerated, she and her mother have only met in situations where they were separated by glass. 'They were never able to touch,' Mr Krucker said. A . dozen years ago, Mr Krucker was among the organizers of an effort in the . Swiss town of Emmetten to support Milke, including by establishing a . bank account that collected donations to aid in her defense. The account . eventually netted about 200,000 Swiss francs, or about $213,000 today. It's now nearly drained, he said. Tragic: Christopher Milke, seen here with his mother Debra, was shot in the head three times. He was just 4 years old . Doubts about Milke's guilt and suspicion about the reliability of the detective's testimony helped motivate Swiss supporters to donate, as did opposition to the death penalty. Many also had concerns that Milke didn't have access to the best defense because she had too little money, he said. Now supporters . are excited about the prospect of her release, Mr Krucker said, but also . worried how she will manage to pay the bond. Ms Janka, who is suffering from cancer, was already forced to sell her home to help cover her daughter's legal bills, he said. Supporters also run a website that requests donations through both German and Swiss accounts. Milke's . ex-husband, Arizona Milke, believes his former wife is . guilty and that supporters are fooled by the postings on the website. Killers: Jim Styers and Roger Scott admitted to murdering Christopher, and both currently are on death row . 'It's fed by propagandized lies,' he said on Friday. 'They write whatever they want and put it up there like it's true.' Her . chance at freedom comes six months after a federal appeals court . overturned Milke's conviction, ruling that the prosecution should have . disclosed information about the truthfulness of the now-retired . detective who testified that Milke confessed. Milke . was a 25-year-old insurance company clerk when her son was killed. She . has maintained her innocence, saying she had nothing to do with the . slaying. The two men . convicted in the case both remain on death row. Neither Roger Scott nor . former Milke roommate James Styers testified at Milke's trial. Scott . confessed during a police interrogation and led detectives to the boy's . body. Maricopa County . prosecutors are still seeking the death penalty against Milke at her . retrial, tentatively set for Sept. 30, and her alleged confession is at . the heart of the case against her. Police . detective Armando Saldate Jr. testified that she confessed to him in a . closed interrogation room. But the confession was not recorded. 'Confession': Detective Armando Saldate claims Milke confessed to her involvement in the murder - but it wasn't recorded and nobody witnessed it - other than Saldate . At trial, Milke denied that she had confessed, but the jury believed the detective. Doubts . about Saldate's honesty arose during Milke's appeals. The 9th Circuit . concluded in March that prosecutors' failure to turn over evidence . related to Saldate's credibility deprived Milke's attorneys of the . chance to question his truthfulness before jurors. 'No . civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy . evidence, quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or overzealousness, to . decide whether to take someone's life or liberty,' Chief Judge Alex . Kozinski wrote for the court. The . court noted four cases in which judges threw out confessions or . indictments because Saldate lied under oath and four instances in which . cases were tossed out or confessions excluded because Saldate violated . the suspect's constitutional rights. Crime scene: This cross marks the spot in the Arizona desert where Christopher Milke was ruthlessly murdered . He . was also suspended for accepting sexual favors from a female motorist . he stopped and then lying about the encounter, the court said. Deputy . County Attorney Vince Imbordino argued last week during a bond hearing . that the purported confession is still admissible, but Judge Rosa Mroz . of Maricopa County Superior Court said the undisclosed material . concerning Saldate 'casts serious doubt' on its validity. Mroz, . who also set Milke's bond, scheduled a September 23 hearing on the . defense's request to prohibit the prosecution from using the confession . during the retrial.","Deborah Milke's conviction was overturned in March .

"In a chilling video released by extreme terrorist group the ISIS, Australians are calling on their fellow countrymen to join them in the Middle East. The 13-minute production titled There Is No Life Without Jihad shows five extremists urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'. Two of the militants are thought to be Australian, and one who is identified as Brother Abu Yahya ash Shami and speaks with a strong Australian accent is believed to have been killed shortly after the taping. Scroll down for video . Pictured: Australian man Abu Yahya ash Shami (left) featured in the propaganda piece which urged people to join the ISIS cause in Syria . Words underneath his name read he 'Received shahadah fighting in the sawat in Al-Khayr (may Allah accept him)'. The ABC report they understand the propaganda piece was filmed a few weeks ago in an unidentified location in Syria. Another Australian, Brother Abu Nour al Iraqi says his 'reasons for coming to jihad are plenty' and 'when it comes to jihad there are two types of people.' 'Those who will fight every single excuse to come to jihad, and those who will fight every single excuse not to come to jihad,' the man says from behind a face mask. A third man who is also thought to be Australian is pictured but does not speak, but at the close of the video ISIS assures his testimony is 'coming soon'. ISIS,short for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and also known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), is an offshoot of terrorist group Al Qaeda. Brother Abu Nour al Iraqi (left)  is also said to be from Australia, and says his 'reasons for coming to jihad are plenty' On Friday, following reports that many Australians are involved in groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned the government has 'absolute determination' to prevent 'returning jihadis' who are a threat to the country. Several Australian Islamists, including a convicted terrorist, have appeared in social media images carrying out bloodied executions during the two-week Iraqi insurgency. The group are believed to be fighting with the extremist group ISIS. Mr Abbott believed up to 100 Australians are involved in groups fighting in Iraq and Syria: 'Some of them are involved with this murderous, murderous Al-Qaeda splinter group,' Mr Abbott said, (referring to the  ISIS). 'Some of them are involved in atrocities.' Also on Friday, extra Australian troops were deployed to Iraq to reinforce security at the embassy in Baghdad. As part of the ongoing social media propaganda undertaken by ISIS, a third Australian Abu Khaled al Cambodi is promoted at the end of the video . Recruiting: Three British men identified as Abu Dujana al Hindi (left) Abu Muthanna al Yemeni (centre) and Abu Bara' Al Hindi (right) urge their 'brothers' to join them . A spokesman for Defence Minister David Johnston on Friday confirmed that a small Australian Defence Force 'liaison element' had been sent to Baghdad to bolster security arrangements at the embassy. Prime Minister Tony Abbott alluded to the decision when voicing his concerns about the safety of Australian staff bunkered down in Baghdad. He said nobody should underestimate the threat posed by the ISIL, the terrorist group advancing towards Baghdad after routing government forces in the north. 'Right now our focus is first of all ensuring that our people in Baghdad are safe and that we have the capacity to remove them if necessary,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Sydney. Also in the disturbing film which was released on Friday, three British men give their own testimonies and reach out to others back home, urging them to join the cause. The video, which is interspersed with music and religious chanting, forms part of ISIS’s global propaganda campaign, urging Muslims to post messages of support on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. It follows the publication of its ‘company accounts’ logging assassinations, suicide missions and bombings. Nasser Muthana, left, pictured in his school uniform and right, in a recruitment video for the al-Qaeda inspired ISIS terror group . Encouragement: At several points the man identifying himself as Abu Bara' Al Hindi claims joining ISIS will alleviate the stress and 'depression' of living in the West . The father of a star medical student who appeared in the chilling ISIS recruitment video and is in Syria with his younger brother says he disowns his two sons. Ahmed Muthana, 57 from Cardiff says that if Nasser Muthana (identified as Brother Abu Muthanna al Yemeni in the video) and 17-year-old Aseel ever return to the UK, he would love to see them go to jail. His comments came as it was revealed his 20-year-old son, was a key figure in a chilling recruitment video aimed at luring jihadists to Iraq. Muthana has been offered places to study medicine by four universities and was due to begin his course last September. Instead he secretly made his way to Syria from his family home in Cardiff with his 17-year-old brother. But their father, who said his sons had been 'brainwashed'  after they began worshipping at different mosques and grew beards explained: 'They don't represent me now and I don't want to see them again. 'I would love to see them go to jail if they return to the UK alive, if they ever come back.' Propaganda: Among those speaking in the video is a man identifying himself as Abu Muthana Al Yemeni (right) - who claims to have travelled to the Middle East from Britain . This week, to the horror of his relatives, Muthana bragged of fighting for the  Al Qaeda-inspired ISIS terror group. He appears alongside two other young British jihadists in the 13-minute long, professionally shot video, which was posted online yesterday. Named in the video as ‘Abu Muthanna Al Yemeni’, he says: ‘We understand no borders. We have participated in battles in Sham [Syria] and in a few days we will go to Iraq and will fight them, and will even go to Lebanon and Jordan, wherever our Sheikh [ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi] wants to send us.’ In a direct message to al-Baghdadi, he adds: ‘Send us, we are your sharp arrows. Throw us at your enemies, wherever they may be.’ Muthana is a former pupil of Cathays High School in Cardiff, where he was an A-grade student . After completing his A-levels, the former school council member received four offers from universities to read medicine, but did not take up any. His family said he set off for Syria about eight months ago. Muthana’s brother Aseel was studying for his A-levels, at the nearby Fitzalan High School, and had dreamed of becoming an English teacher. Global: Another man making an appearance in the chilling video is Abu Yahya ash Shami (pictured) - who speaks with a strong Australian accent . A group of 44 workers who were kidnapped by ISIS in northern Iraq have been released after four days captive, a Turkish diplomat claims. The hostages, of various nationalities, were captured on Tuesday after militants raided a construction site of a hospital near Kirkuk. Following days of negotiations, the deputy security chief of Kirkuk secured their release and they are now travelling to a safe house, according to reports. The workers - believed to be from Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Turkmenistan - were captured as the extremists continued their sweep down towards Baghdad. On Thursday, Turkey's foreign office told all citizens to leave Iraq as a further 80 Turkish nationals were kidnapped by militants. Mr Muthana added: ‘I feel very sad. I don’t know how Nasser got out there. I found out that he had gone to Turkey because he phoned home and spoke to my youngest son. ‘He left in November. We didn’t hear anything else until now when we have seen the video. ‘I thought he had got married out there and wasn’t coming back. There was very  little I could do anyway. I didn’t think he’d got involved in jihad.’ He added of Nasser: ‘He was very kind, very quiet and was into helping people. I thought he was quite Western in outlook. He would play football and rugby with his friends.’ One man in the video, named as Abu Bara Al Hindi, claims he too is from Britain, and describes jihad as ‘the cure for depression’. Speaking in front of the extremist group’s black flag, he asks: ‘Are you willing to sacrifice the fat job you’ve got, the big car you’ve got, the family you have? The third British jihadist, who calls himself Abu Dujana al Hindi, says: ‘A message to the brothers who have stayed behind. ‘You have to ask yourself what prevents you from joining the ranks of the mujahideen? What prevents you from obtaining martyrdom? You are going to die anyway.’ British Prime Minister David Cameron has warned that Britain cannot afford to ignore the chaos in Iraq and Syria because of the risk that British jihadis will bring their murderous tactics back to the UK.

"A young woman has been labelled a medical mystery after falling victim to an unidentified illness which causes human nails to grow out of her hair follicles. Shanyna Isom, 28, suffered an allergic reaction three years ago which caused the debilitating syndrome which has left her struggling to walk and carry out daily chores. The university student was left covered in hard scabs as 'nails' replaced the hair on her body and doctors are still in the dark about how to cure Shanyna’s mysterious illness. Scroll down for video . Unknown: Shanyna Isom has lost all the hair on her head to the vicious mystery illness and wears a wig and hat to cover it . Before and After: She suffered an allergic reaction three years ago which caused the debilitating syndrome which has left her struggling to walk and carry out daily chores . Shanyna Isom lives with her family in Memphis and was in her first year at university when the nightmare began. In September 2009 she was prescribed steroids after suffering an asthma attack and within hours the law student was ‘itching’ all over her body. Soon black bumps covered her legs and doctors treated her for everything from eczema to Staphylococcal infection to no avail. Shanyna became bedridden as the illness took over and doctors tried to determine what was wrong. Pain: Cause not known: Doctors have no explanation as to why Shanyna had this reaction to the steroids . Condition: Instead of hair, human nails grow out of her hair follicles, but doctor's have yet to establish a cause . Mystery: She produces 12 times the normal number of skin cells per hair follicle, suffocating her skin . In 2011 she began treatment in Baltimore where doctors established that the bumps were in fact human nails slowly covering Shanyna’s body. She produces 12 times the normal number of skin cells per hair follicle, suffocating her skin. ‘Where hair grows, nails are growing,’ Shanyna told WAFB news. Today doctors have yet to diagnose her but have been able to control her symptoms. ‘I couldn't sit up and I couldn't walk, but now I can walk with a cane and sometimes I can walk on my own.’ Procedure: Today doctors have yet to diagnose her but have been able to control her symptoms . The criminal justice major describes it as a nightmare she is trying to wake up from. ‘They’ve tested me from A to Z and everything was coming back negative. ‘As of right now, I am the only one in the world with my illness.’ The illness has left Shanyna and her family deep in debt as state-issued insurance does not cover her care at the specialist unit she attends in Baltimore and only covers five of the 17 medications she is prescribed. The family savings accounts are dry and her outstanding medical bills are currently up to £160,000 ($250,000).

Shanyna hopes that the foundation will be able to raise enough money to cover her medical bills and help others in the same situation.

"The Italian defender whose shoulder he sank his teeth into probably still doesn’t see the funny side. But Luis Suarez’s extraordinary attack on Giorgio Chiellini was yesterday the inspiration for dozens of joke images and videos on the internet. One mock-up that proved popular around the world had Suarez as Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal criminal from the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs. Scroll down for video... Monster: Luis Suarez is portrayed as Jaws on a poster from the 1975 . thriller after the Uruguay striker's extraordinary attack on Giorgio . Chiellini during his team's World Cup match against Italy . Danger from the deep: Suarez became the subject of many joke images and videos on the internet after Tuesday's incident. He has been widely depicted as a shark . The Uruguay striker was also pictured as Dracula and even as the shark from the Hollywood film Jaws – the theme of a headline employed by the Mail yesterday. Suarez’s sponsors, who include Adidas, do not see the player’s third biting outrage as a laughing matter however. The sportswear firm’s executives met in Rio de Janeiro yesterday to discuss the incident. A spokesman said: ‘Adidas is aware of the issue involving Luis Suarez. We await Fifa’s full investigation into this matter and will respond accordingly.’ Adidas took the unusual step of issuing a statement condemning Suarez’s ‘unacceptable’ actions when he bit Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic during a Premier League game last year. Poker brand 888, which also has a deal with the player, said it would not tolerate unsporting behaviour and was seriously reviewing its relationship with the star. Ones for the album: Online jokers have turned Luis Suarez into Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal criminal from the Silence of the Lambs, pictured left, and a vampire, pictured right . Suarez has been mocked up as Dracula from the silent era - but his sponsors do not see his third biting incident as a laughing matter . Under control: One mock-up proving popular is Suarez as a dog in a neck cone, while the footballer has also been depicted as a novelty bottle opener . Liverpool fans are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the investigation by Fifa. The global governing body has the power to ban Suarez from club football as well as from international games. The Uruguayan, who scored the two goals that effectively ended England’s World Cup hopes, was watched by millions of TV viewers plunging his mouth towards Chiellini’s shoulder on Tuesday night. Eating out: New take(away) on the incident . The Italian player pulled down his shirt to reveal a red bite mark, but the referee took no action and Suarez was allowed to continue playing. Uruguay then scored to go through to the tournament’s knock-out stages at Italy’s expense. Suarez’s lawyer yesterday claimed that European football chiefs were trying to have the striker banned. Alejandro Balbi told Uruguayan radio: ‘We don’t have any doubts that this has happened because it’s Suarez and secondly because Italy was eliminated. There’s a lot of pressure from England and Italy.’ The lawyer, who is a board member of Uruguay’s football association, also suggested Suarez was being targeted because he threatened other nations’ chances of winning the World Cup, including those of hosts Brazil. Suarez, a married father of two, was suspended for seven games for biting PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal on the shoulder while playing for Dutch club Ajax in 2010. He received a ten-game ban in England for biting Ivanovic.","Luis Suarez plunged his mouth into Giorgio Chiellini during World Cup tie .

"Details of a sex-change operation carried out in the 18th century have been uncovered, in what may be one of the earliest instances of gender-reassignment surgery. A pamphlet called ‘The case of the boy who had been mistaken for a girl; with three anatomical views of the parts, before and after the operation and cure’ by surgeon Thomas Brand has been uncovered. It describes  how the sex-change operation was carried out, the New Republic website reports. The pamphlet, published in 1787, describes how the parents of a seven-year-old brought their to child to him with a 'complaint in the groin'. Scroll down for video . A pamphlet documents 18th century surgeon Thomas Brand's sex change operation, which experts say could be one of the earliest examples of gender reassignment surgery . Upon examination, Mr Brand said he noticed an ‘irregularity’ in the patient’s ‘external parts’. He said: At first it seemed to be the female organs with an imperforated hymen; but, on more close examination, it was discovered that the part, which had the appearance of the labia pudenda, was in fact the scrotum, divided by its septum.’ Mr Brand said he ‘performed an operation to free the penis from its confinement’ which involved' a longditudinal incision on each size of the penis, as close to the pubis as could be admitted with safety.' The 'cure' went on 'favourably', he added. After operating on the young child, whose name is unknown, Mr Brand said the child was able ‘to urinate standing up, wear trousers, and enjoy the privileges of being a male.’ The pamphlet contains no mention of either the patient nor his parents being consulted. However he did not view the operation as a sex change, but as a way of returning the child to his ‘proper’ gender. Denying that hermaphrodites exist, he said: ‘The term “hermaphrodite” is properly understood as an animal that has both the male and female organs equally and perfectly formed. But there is not reason to believe that such a case ever had existence in the human subject.’ The pamphlet describes the case of a 'girl' brought to Mr Brand with a 'complaint in the groin. He later discovered the child ws actually male . He concluded that if the patient had been of the upper classes, the case would have been a lot more interesting. The pamphlet is eight pages long, with three illustrations of the child’s anatomy, and may describe on of the earliest instances of sex-change surgery. It was discovered by Carol Warren, a professor of sociology at the University of Kansas, who found it when she was researching the history of electricity in the college’s rare books library. The story has now been published as a study the journal Sexualities. 'I was looking through a bunch of materials that had been shoved together and this one appeared', she told New Republic journalist Alice Robb. Elizabeth Reis, author of 'Bodies in Doubt: An American History of Intersex' and professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of Oregon told Ms Robb that she had not come across any earlier examples of gender reassignment surgery. ‘The first case I found (in America) was in the 1840s, and it was received quite critically by fellow physicians’ Mary Fissell, a professor of the History of Medicine at John Hopkins University added that Brand was ‘not a quack’. While sex-changes were unusual, the operation fits in with the historical record for surgeries carried out at the time, Prof Fissell said. She said: ‘Certainly this is unusual for the time period. ‘In the late eighteenth century, people were doing a little more adventuresome surgery. ‘That’s the kind of operative surgery they were doing at that point. It’s not invading a body cavity. It’s not opening up the abdomen or chest. People wouldn’t have survived that.’","Pamphlet discovered in University of Kansas' rare books library .

"Preachers of hate will be banned from public speaking or spreading their poison on social media, under sweeping new powers unveiled today. Home Secretary Theresa May says the fanatics are creating an ‘environment’ where acts of violence become acceptable and they must be silenced. The Extremist Disruption Orders – which have been dubbed Asbos for hate clerics – will target the likes of Anjem Choudary, who for years has spread bile at public meetings or on the internet. VIDEO Scroll down to see UK Prime Minister David Cameron speak out against extremism . Home Secretary Theresa May, who said fanatics are creating an ‘environment’ where acts of violence become acceptable, has unveiled the Extremist Disruption Orders – which have been dubbed Asbos for hate clerics . The definition will also include anybody who seeks to ‘overthrow democracy’. In the past, the rules could have applied to spokesmen for Sinn Fein, such as Gerry Adams. The restrictions placed on the hate preachers will be backed by criminal punishments and a possible jail term. They could include a ban on speaking at public events. Anything they want to put on social media would have to be cleared by the authorities in advance, and the fanatics could also be banned from attending specific events and told who they can associate with, in powers that are similar to the now defunct control orders. Also, they could be stopped from taking positions of responsibility, such as in schools, where they could spread their message. In a separate move, new banning orders will target extremist groups in order to make it easier to force them to disband. Mrs May said hate preachers had been operating on the ‘very margins’ of the criminal law, which was designed to tackle incitement to acts of terrorism. She now wants to target the extreme views whipped up by the fanatics which can lead to violence. The Extremist Disruption Orders – which have been dubbed Asbos for hate clerics – will target the likes of Anjem Choudary (above), who for years has spread bile at public meetings or on Twitter and other websites . In an exclusive interview, she told the Mail: ‘It creates the environment in which that sort of thinking appears to be acceptable. ‘Of course we want to maintain free speech but we do not want to see incitement.’ Mrs May also warned of the dangers of sharia courts operating in Britain which do not work to ‘British values’. The Home Secretary said she been given examples of sharia courts passing verdicts on women trying to flee violent or abusive relationships which did not amount to ‘fair treatment’. She wants Muslim women to be reassured that they have recourse to the British legal system and do not have to accept unjust verdicts. A crackdown on ‘absurd’ human rights rulings which threaten to hamper British troops carrying out vital missions was last night signalled by the Defence Secretary. Michael Fallon said he was ‘appalled’ that legal challenges over incidents that happened in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost the taxpayer £85million – money which could have been spent on new kit. The Government wants to restrict judgments which decree that the European Convention on Human Rights applies on the battlefield. Mr Fallon said the prospect of health and safety-style laws could seriously impact on Britain’s military capability. A series of court rulings in both Britain and Europe have extended the reach of human rights laws over military actions and, critics say, open the door of claims against the Government. Mr Fallon said: ‘I’m appalled. It’s not just being used, it’s being abused. We already have military law and we already have international humanitarian law, we certainly do not need European law in this area hamstringing the efforts of our armed forces.’ He added: ‘We’ll end up with every platoon taking a legal adviser out on patrol and that is quite simply unacceptable.’ Stepping into what is a sensitive area, Mrs May said: ‘There are good sharia courts but we need to look that all sharia courts are operating within British values.’ The so-called EDOs targeting hate clerics would be issued by the courts as a civil power, following an application by the police. There will be a right of appeal to the High Court. The authorities would have to show, on the ‘balance of probabilities’, that the individual ‘is undertaking, has undertaken, or proposes to undertake activities that spread, incite, promote or justify hatred against a person or group of persons on the grounds of that person’s or group of persons’ disability, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and/or transgender identity’. The move is likely to draw fierce criticism from civil liberties groups and some MPs, given that the people targeted will not have been convicted of any crime. The Lib Dems are also certain to object to such a dramatic step, but Mrs May insists the powers are necessary. They will be included in the Tory manifesto with the intention of being passed shortly after the election. The powers will sit side-by-side with the banning orders, which also address the problem of groups which operate on the fringes of criminal law. In her speech to the Tory conference in Birmingham today, Mrs May will also announce that the Home Office is taking control across Government of tackling Islamic extremism. Currently, responsibility is shared with the Communities Department run by Eric Pickles. Schools and other public bodies will be told they have an obligation to promote British values to try to prevent a repeat of the Birmingham schools ‘trojan horse’ plot. Politicians have for years warned of the dangers posed by hate preachers such as Choudary and his former mentor Omar Bakri, but have not produced a solution for those who know the boundaries of the criminal law. Officials believe that, in an era of social media, it is vital to find a solution. Last week Choudary was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a banned terrorist group but was then released within 48 hours. He claimed his arrest had been ‘politically motivated’ ahead of the vote for the UK to join military action against the Islamic State in Syria.","Theresa May will ban preachers of hate from spreading their poison online .

"This is the horrifying moment a deer careered into a road and smashed into a car's windshield as it tried to escape a pack of baying wild dogs. The animal hit the screen of a car being driven by Artem Kourikov, 32, on a highway near Tomsk in Russia, before bouncing off into the road. The animal then found its feet and ran off into the undergrowth apparently unscathed - thus escaping falling prey to the hungry pack. Scroll down for video . This is the horrifying moment a deer careered into a road just before it smashed into a car's windshield as it tried to escape a pack of baying wild dogs . Mr Kourikov, who was travelling with his girlfriend Natalya Loukanova, 29, said: 'There was this sudden movement to the right, the undergrowth parted and this sudden shape appeared in front of my car. 'It was over in a split second - it was a deer which had landed on the glass. 'It smashed it completely. 'As quickly as it was on the car bonnet it was off again. 'It sort of bounced over the roof onto the road, found its feet and ran off into the undergrowth on the other side. It seemed unhurt, it was certainly able to put on a burst of speed. The terrified animal ran into the pathway of a car being driven by Artem Kourikov, 32, on a highway near Tomsk in Russia . With no time to stop or swerve Mr Kourikov had no choice but to hit the creature . The impact completely shattered the windscreen of the car - but miraculously Mr Artem Kourikov, his girlfriend Natalya Loukanova, and the deer, were all unscathed. The animal bounded off into the undergrowth - escaping the pack of hungry animals which had been chasing it . 'The wild dogs that had been all up for the hunt and were slavering at the mouth seemed to have lost interest. 'I guess they thought they had their prey in their sights and then it was gone. The traffic going up and down the highway put them off the chase. 'They sniffed the air for a bit, barked a little bit, and then turned around and headed back the way they had come. So if nothing else, our impromptu meeting with the deer saved it from the dogs.' An estimated 1,500 people across Russia die in accidents involving deer or moose every year. Last week a bus collided with a moose on a busy road in neighbouring Ukraine with the creature's antler's smashing through the wind shield and becoming embedded in the driver's cockpit.","Animal bounced into car driven by Artem Kourikov, in Tomsk, Russia .

"Building an interstellar spacecraft that can take humans beyond the solar system might sound like something out of a sci-fi film - but one organisation has plans to do just that in the next 100 years. Designers claim that in order to do so, we’ll need to build ‘living worldships’ akin to Noah’s Ark that are entirely self-sustainable. These ships could then be used to rescue and house the human population in the event of a global catastrophe, for example. New research suggests that if we want to achieve interstellar travel we will need to build self-sustainable 'living worldships' that can support multiple generations of humans. These ships could also be used to rescue the human population in the event of a global catastrophe, for example. Artist's impression is pictured . Dubbed Project Persephone, the research is looking at how a long-duration manned mission out of the solar system could feasibly survive. The conclusion is that any future ‘generation ship’ we build will need to be entirely self-sustainable in terms of not only food and water, but cultural advances as well. In essence, any manned vehicle we one day send into interstellar space will need a 'flourishing ecosystem'. Project Persephone is a study for Icarus Interstellar - a non-profit organisation hoping to one day enable human interstellar spaceflight through their One Hundred Year Starship Project. This is a joint project run by Darpa, Nasa, Icarus Interstellar and the Foundation for Enterprise Development. Announced in January 2012, it has the goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112. To do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies, including ‘warping’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at faster-than-light speeds. The project is also considering building ‘generation ships’ that move slowly but have a self-sustainable long-term population. To date Nasa has contributed $100,000 (£60,000) to the project and Darpa $1 million (£600,000). It is the belief of Icarus, and other agencies and organisations, that humanity can build a ‘worldship’ in 100 years that will take a large group of people on a mission beyond the solar system. This could be a so-called generation ship, with multiple generations of humans living aboard the vessel on its journey into deep space and back again. To make such a mission possible would require an initiative such as Project Persephone, said project leader Rachel Armstrong, a senior architecture and design lecturer at the University of Greenwich. ‘Persephone is the living interior of a worldship,’ Armstrong tells MailOnline. ‘We’re not trying to just take stuff from Earth and put it in a giant pot, it’s about how do we design an environment within a closed system. ‘So, could we grow an ecosystem from scratch?’ Armstrong’s research suggests that if we do build an interstellar spaceship within 100 years - which she is fairly certain we will - the ship itself will need to be like a mini-Earth. We will need to take into account soil, weather cycles and other processes that underpin our existence. This includes technological advances - the society on the ship will need to be able to anticipate cultural steps that will be occurring on Earth. ‘Rather than presupposing what the needs of an interstellar civilization may be within this system, which will experience its own physical and chemical rhythms, Persephone is approaching the idea of a living space within a worldship by taking a bottom-up approach to its construction,' Armstrong writes in her research. ‘By understanding the basic physical and chemical interactions that may spontaneously form systems that shape the flow of matter through the worldship, it may be possible to create events within them such as, growth and decomposition, around which human activity can thrive.’ In Armstrong's research she has been studying artificial soils for interstellar spacecraft including Liesegang Floret 3, pictured, which uses activated gel and inorganic salts to move substances through a matrix . The worldship, artist's impression pictured, could be built from space junk in order to grow its living interior - a unique kind of space ecology. The spaceship would also gather asteroids in order to aid its sustainability . ‘Paradoxically on Earth we have ruined the most fertile soils by building cities, so essentially the idea is to see what kind of life a space soil might support,’ explained Armstrong. ‘We kind of understand the speculative nature of this project but it’s about understanding the broad questions.’ The aim is . to build such an interstellar spaceship in a century although, admitted Armstrong: ‘Whether that’s achievable I don’t know.’ But, as Armstrong pointed out, it is not only private organisations like Icarus Interstellar that are researching ambitious projects like this. In the U.S., Darpa and Nasa are working on the same 100 Year Starship (100YSS) project with the goal of taking humans outside the solar system in 100 years. ‘I think the consensus for the next generation of space vessels is 100 years,’ said Armstrong. ‘Whether we’ll have a full starship or not depends on funding, technological progress and cultural support for these kinds of projects.’ Armstrong added that, in order to keep continued support, some of the technology designed for these ‘starship cities’ could be transferred into modern cities. This would allow the public to see useful applications deriving from such research. Future living worldships will need to make use of resources in their environment in order to survive. This could include utilising asteroids and space junk to ensure the ship is self-sustainable. An artist's impression of this kind of ship is pictured .","Building self-sustainable spacecraft is the key to interstellar travel .

"Boris Johnson today condemned 'ugly and stupid' metal ‘spikes’ installed at a luxury block of flats to deter the homeless from sleeping there. The London Mayor joined the online outrage after pictures of the blunt 1.5in studs were posted on Twitter. Critics described them as ‘inhumane’ and said rough sleepers were being treated like pigeons, who are deterred by spikes on potential perches. Condemned: Metal 'spikes' installed at a luxury block of flats to deter the homeless from sleeping there were condemned as 'brutal' last night. The blunt 1.5in studs caused outrage after a photo of them was put on Twitter . 'Spikes': Critics described the studs as 'inhumane' and said rough sleepers were being treated like pigeons . Hundreds of people have signed an internet petition urging to have the 19 studs removed from an alcove next to the entrance of the privately-owned building in Southwark, South London. Writing on Twitter today, the London Mayor said: 'Spikes outside Southwark housing development to deter rough sleeping are ugly, self defeating & stupid. Developer should remove them ASAP. 'We've spent £34m on the likes of 'no 2nd night out, reaching 3/4s of rough sleepers, but must do more. Spikes are simply not the answer.' But some campaigners said that opponents . were missing the point and argued that the real issue was a shortage of . help for homeless people with mental health, drug and alcohol problems. Studs . and railings have been fitted to the doorways and ledges of buildings . in Britain to discourage rough sleepers for over a decade. The latest spikes outside the Southwark block, where a . two-bedroom flat is worth as much as £900,000, have divided opinion . among people living in the apartment building. Call for action: Hundreds of people have signed an internet petition urging London Mayor Boris Johnson (pictured) to have the 19 studs removed . Residents were not told before they were put in two weeks ago. One described them as ‘a form of persecution’, saying: ‘I didn’t . know what they were at first, I thought they were a design feature. 'When . I realised I thought it was a strange and brutal idea. It’s like they . are treating people like animals by putting down the spikes, similar to . the ones used to deter pigeons. 'I’ve lived in this area for some time . and there is a lot of homelessness and other problems – these spikes are . a form of persecution.’ But others welcomed the move, saying that rough sleepers had previously frightened women returning to the block after dark. Mark Hicks, who has lived in the building for a year, said: ‘I think they’re a very good idea. We used to come back and find drunk homeless people in the doorway, which is not very nice at all. If it stops that, it’s great.’ Another long-time resident, who asked to remain anonymous, added: ‘There is a huge problem with rough sleepers here. ‘I have female friends in the building who are scared to come home at night because they have been intimidated and threatened by homeless people in the doorway. It’s about time something has been done about this. ‘In any case, they aren’t really spikes - they’re not sharp. I’m sure someone could put a blanket over them and sleep here if they wanted to.’ One anonymous blogger, who previously worked with the homeless in London, said the spikes were ‘not a nice thing’ but added: ‘As horrific as it must sound, sometimes you have to remove a person’s sleep site in order to engage that person.’ Homeless charity St Mungo’s Broadway, which has a centre to help rough sleepers get back on their feet near the Southwark flats, said the spikes were a ‘rather brutal’ approach to getting people off the streets. Serious issue: But some campaigners said that opponents were missing the point and argued that the real issue was a shortage of help for homeless people with mental health, drug and alcohol problems (file image) Chief executive Howard Sinclair added: ‘To undertake such measures without providing the necessary assistance to people who sleep rough is wrong - the aim is to help people move in, not just move on.’ Katharine Sacks-Jones, from homelessness charity Crisis, said: ‘We will never tackle rough sleeping with studs in the pavement. 'Instead we must deal with the causes.’.","Metal 'spikes' installed at luxury block of flats in Southwark, South London .

"Russell Brand has certainly not held back since becoming a crusader against global capitalism. He has called for an ‘orgy’ of banker bashing, urged people to refuse to pay taxes and called profit a ‘filthy word’. But he appears to have no problem with raising nearly £1million from wealthy capitalists including investment bankers and a Premier League footballer to make a documentary about himself. Russell Brand has launched repeated attacks on bankers and called for debt to be abolished in his new book . But it emerged today that the company behind his new film has been bankrolled by city financiers. File photo . Investors were enticed with generous tax breaks to support the film, portraying Brand, 39, as a ‘troubled visionary’ seeking to change the world. The entertainer-turned-campaigner – said to be worth £15million – faced charges of hypocrisy after details of the funding arrangements emerged yesterday. His public pronouncements on bankers – whom he wants to be punished for their role in the financial crisis – have been rather more outspoken. ‘I think an orgy of any kind would be great, but one that focuses on banker bashing would be the best kind,’ he told BBC One’s Question Time last year. He has also declared on Newsnight: ‘David Cameron says profit isn’t a dirty word. Well I say profit is a filthy word.’ These trenchant positions are at odds with his use of venture capital to finance the upcoming film. The film funded by investors is a documentary in which Brand calls on fans not to 'comply' with the system . Company documents list Russell Edward Brand as a director of Mayfair Film Partnership Limited since his 'appointment' in July  2010. Other directors are listed as Brand's manager, Andrew Antonio, the best man at his wedding, Nicholas Linnen and John Linnen. The company is registered at an accountants firm in Burnham on Sea, Somerset, whose offices are opposite a tattoo parlour and a junk shop in the seaside town. Investors are believed to include city financial director Una Lodge, Sunderland and former England footballer Wes Brown, and an estimated 17 other shareholders. Called Brand, it is co-produced by Mayfair Film Partnership, of which he is a director. Shares in the firm worth £973,000 were sold to 21 outside investors, including an executive with bank giant JPMorgan Chase. The largest stake went to Sunderland defender Wes Brown. The shares were bought under the Government’s Enterprise Investment Scheme, which provides tax incentives for people to invest in risky new businesses. One leading accountant, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He’s being a capitalist, but he then goes on Newsnight and rants about how terrible capitalism is. I would challenge his hypocrisy.’ A source said Brand did not benefit from any tax relief because he is not an investor in the company. Brand hit out at bankers during an appearance on the BBC's Question Time, calling for them to 'go down' The BBC gave Brand many platforms to publicise his book Revolution – but rarely challenged his claims. It took website Buzzfeed to find a professor, Chandran Kukathas of the London School of Economics, to assess his work. BRAND ON INTERNATIONAL CAR SALES: ‘I wouldn’t worry too much about exporting them, as other countries have their own f***ing cars.’ PROF KUKATHAS: ‘It’s hard to see how one could come up with a sillier thought. A 30-second search on Wikipedia will tell you fewer than 50 countries make cars.’ ON THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY: ‘If my vacuum cleaner went nuts and forced me to live in economic slavery, I wouldn’t roll my eyes and say “Oh well” and humbly do its bidding. I’d turn it off and f*** it out the window.’ THE PROFESSOR: ‘Is the industry really like a vacuum cleaner? How does one turn it off? Or throw it out the window? ON DEBT: ‘Cancelling personal debt would stimulate the economy more than any “too big to fail” bank quantitative easing.’ THE PROFESSOR: ‘Mr Brand is quite confused. Quantitative easing is neither necessary nor sufficient for stopping a bank or any other corporation from failing.’ ON CORPORATIONS: ‘If they don’t pay tax, we’ll reclaim their assets and give them to the people who work there to run.’ THE PROFESSOR: ‘What does he mean? Most corporations are owned by shareholders. If you take the assets away from them … you will deprive millions of their income, and perhaps their livelihood.’ ON THE NATION STATE: ‘It may have served its purpose and have to be dissolved – it’s not a big deal.’ THE PROFESSOR: ‘I have no idea what he means here. How is this to be done?’ ON REVOLUTION: ‘The spiritual Revolution, the Revolution we are about to realise, will be fast because the organisms are in place.’ THE PROFESSOR: ‘If the revolution advocated is a spiritual transformation, what is one to make of the authoritarian element of the manifesto? It sounds like the new society is going to have an awful lot of confiscating, and forbidding – stopping people from exporting, or fracking, or building up capital.’ Russell Brand was mocked this weekend after he appeared in a corporate box at a West Ham match. Rather than sit among fellow fans, the comedian was seen standing among suited businessman behind the glass of a hospitality suite. Footballer Joey Barton joked about Brand on Twitter, posting: 'Russell Brand. Man of the people. Starting his revolution from the executive boxes. Very Che Guevara.' Another website user added: 'The cost of one executive box for a day at Upton Park could pay for an NHS nurse for a month. Disgusted.' Brand was later filmed kissing West Ham manager Sam Allardyce after his team beat league champions Manchester City 2-1. Brand was criticised after appearing in a hospitality suite during a visit to watch his team, West Ham United .","Comedian has repeatedly hit out at the City and called for debt to be illegal .

Depending on how long it takes for the Iraqi government to regain control of the territory seized by the militants – if that ever happens – some of the refugees may try to travel on to Europe. About a quarter of Mosul’s two million residents fled after fighters from the hardline Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group seized the city this week. One of the refugees, a labourer named Abed, said: 'Masked men came to our house and they threatened us: ""We will get to you."" So we fled. They kidnapped other people. They took away some people for interrogation.' He said ISIS fighters - as well as masked bandits taking advantage of the chaos - were seizing young women for rape or forced marriage. Many of the refugees headed east into the autonomous region of Kurdistan, which has escaped the worst of the violence that has rocked Iraq since the American and British invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. They must have family already living in Kurdistan or a sponsor in order to receive permission to enter the area, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Neighbouring countries are already struggling to look after the millions displaced by civil war in Syria . Children living in camps are dependent on aid agencies after their families fled their homes empty-handed . It is estimated that a quarter of the 2million inhabitants of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, have already left . Some of . the refugees arrived at checkpoints on foot carrying no belongings and . with no money or any idea of where they would go next. Iraqi . forces reportedly retreated before the terror groups arrived, with one . soldier telling how his commanding officer ordered him to abandon his . post. Shaker Karam, 38, said: 'We didn't even raise our weapons. This isn't even unimaginable - it's madness. We didn't even see a terrorist.' Gemma Woods, of United Nations refugee agency the UNHCR, said the number of people crossing into Kurdistan had fallen after a panicked surge on Tuesday but thousands continued to flee. She described seeing a family of 12, including a 70-year-old grandmother, who had travelled on foot for two days from their farm outside of Mosul to escape the ISIS onslaught. ‘Once they reached the checkpoint, they had no inkling of what they might do next. They were out of money and had nowhere to go,’ she said. Many arrive at checkpoints already out of money and food having walked for hours through the desert .

Aid . agencies are scrambling to provide food, water, hygiene kits and tents . to the refugees in the short term, but many are likely to need help for a . long time to come. The . U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, said thousands of displaced, . particularly children, were sheltering in schools, hospitals and mosques . outside Mosul, many of them without adequate water, sanitation, or . shelter. The Red Cross said it had already distributed food and relief . to 8,000 people near Mosul. The civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, has resulted in millions of people being forced to flee their homes. Lebanon is hosting more than 1 million Syrian refugees, Turkey has taken in 780,000, Jordan nearly 600,000, and there are already 225,000 of them in Kurdistan. Only a relatively small number have claimed asylum in Europe – the figure is estimated at 100,000, of whom about 3,800 have sought refuge in the UK. But there have been concerns about growing numbers of refugees and other migrants attempting to make the perilous sea crossing from North Africa into the European Union. Iraqi men gather outside an army recruiting centre in Baghdad to join up and battle Islamist militants . The Iraqi army is now training new recruits amid reports it fled northern regions before Islamists arrived . Between January and April this year, . more than 25,000 people tried to cross from Libya into Italy, up from . just over 1,000 a year earlier. At least a third of the latest arrivals . were said to be Syrians fleeing their country’s civil war. Earlier this year Italy warned that up to 600,000 migrants were waiting to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe. There are about 4.7 million Kurds living in Iraqi Kurdistan. They mostly belong to the Sunni branch of Islam, which is often bitterly opposed to the rival Shia sect of the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and the Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad. By zealously manning checkpoints into the autonomous region, Kurdish security forces have managed to prevent the scale of terrorist attacks seen in other parts of Iraq. But there are fears that the huge influx of refugees from Mosul over recent days - including some soldiers and police who abandoned their weapons and uniforms to flee the ISIS fighters - may also allow militants to enter Kurdistan.

"Heart surgeon Peter O'Keefe has been suspended on full pay for more than two years, at a cost to the NHS of £250,000 . A heart surgeon has been suspended on full pay for two-and-a-half years at a cost to the taxpayer of up to £500,000 while he faces bullying allegations. Consultant Peter O'Keefe, 49, has been on 'gardening leave' since April 2012 amid fears he has been targeted as a whistleblower for raising concerns about patient care. The NHS in Wales is continuing to meet his salary of around £95,000 a year while having to pay a similar sum to another surgeon filling his role. Mr O'Keefe was suspended from the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff after being accused of bullying junior colleagues. But 18 months previously he voiced concerns about the treatment of a patient who suffered serious brain damage. His intervention resulted in a critical report into safety failings. Mr O'Keefe has been prevented from working at a time when his hospital has been heavily criticised for lengthy waiting lists for cardiac procedures. The Conservatives accused health bosses of wasting money that could be spent on treating patients by 'dithering' over the disciplinary hearing – the latest in a series of scandals to hit the Labour-run Welsh NHS. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board denies there is any link between the surgeon's suspension and his earlier complaint about care standards. A friend of the cardiothoracic surgeon said Mr O'Keefe suspects he was victimised for speaking out. One source told The Sunday Times: 'There was annoyance on the intensive care unit that he had reported the matter.' But a spokesman at the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board told MailOnline, that is 'absolutely' not the case. 'We absolutely reject the suggestion that the suspension of the surgeon in question is in any way related to any concerns he may have expressed about the care of patients,' he said. 'The process of suspending a consultant is not one that this health board enters into lightly.' His case was highlighted by the Conservative opposition in the Welsh Assembly yesterday, as an example of waste in the NHS. Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said: 'When serious allegations are made against any member of NHS staff, it is right that such claims are thoroughly investigated. 'But there is no reason why it should take over two and a half years. 'Against a backdrop of a crisis in cardiac care that has seen Welsh patients sent to Bristol for treatment because waiting times were so severe, the Welsh NHS cannot afford to have specialist surgeons suspended for two and a half years on full pay. The 46-year-old was sent on 'gardening leave' in April 2012 and a formal investigation was launched by health bosses at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, pictured. While they declined to comment on the allegations against Mr O'Keefe they said the case has nothing to do with the standard of his work . A barrister appointed to chair the case was taken ill earlier this year, causing a delay. The hospital has been forced to employ a locum consultant to cover Mr O'Keefe's work, at a cost thought to be close to the £94,000 salary the heart surgeon, pictured, is paid . In July 2013 it emerged the University Hospital of Wales had been branded 'dangerous' in a damning new report, that said patients were at risk because of increased waiting times. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) warned people waiting for heart operations at the hospital in Cardiff were 'dying regularly' and some children were suffering as a result of the delays. The report said: . In May bosses at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board confirmed plans to invest £2.4million  in tackling surgical waiting lists. It came as the RCS acknowledged  improvements had already been made. Dr Graham Shortland, the health board's Medical Director, said: 'There has been an incredible amount of work to improve surgical services over the last year and things have moved on considerably. 'However, we do know that there is still much to do and we are only at the start of delivering our ambitious proposals. 'The Welsh NHS is reeling from Labour's legacy of record-breaking cuts. 'Yet a health board which last year had its accounts qualified for breaching its spending limits can afford to pay a senior surgeon a near-six-figure salary while suspended and pay similar salaries to locums to cover his workload. 'Health chiefs must end their dithering approach which is wasting NHS cash that could be spent improving patient care and reducing cardiac waiting times.' Dr Richard Lewis, Welsh Secretary of the British Medical Association, said: 'I can't comment on the circumstances of this particular case, but long suspensions are never good for the individual concerned or for the health service. 'If an individual is able to return to work after a disciplinary hearing, they will require retraining after a long period of absence.' Dr Graham Shortland, the medical director for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: 'We do not take disciplinary steps lightly, but believe that when serious allegations are made the University Health Board has a duty to patients, staff and the people we serve to investigate such allegations thoroughly. 'We can confirm that a surgeon has been suspended since April 2012. We have been following the Welsh Government's disciplinary procedure in order to ensure there is a full and fair investigation. 'Unfortunately, through no fault of either party, the process which has already taken far too long, has been held up. However, we hope to be able to secure a way forward in the next few weeks. 'Due to the legal and confidential nature of such issues we are unable to say anything further. 'We would like to reassure the public that the health board is doing all it can to bring this matter to a swift resolution which is in the best interests of all involved.' The board confirmed that Mr O'Keefe's surgical work was being covered on a locum basis to minimise delays for patients. Locum costs are on the consultant pay scale between £72,927 and £94,679. Mr O'Keefe, who qualified as a doctor in 1987, did not wish to comment.","Peter O'Keefe was sent on 'gardening leave' in April 2012 .

"Kelly Harwood, pictured outside Aberdeen Sheriff Court, where she has faced charges of wasting police time after falsely claiming her friend's son had raped her . A woman was remanded in custody today after falsely accusing her friend's son of rape. Kelly Harwood had drunken consensual sex with the 30-year-old on a camp bed set up in her friend's kitchen. But she started feeling guilty because she had betrayed her friend and told him she had not agreed to it moments after they stopped. Harwood then called the police and said she had been raped while she had been asleep at the city centre flat in Aberdeen. The man then ran to wake his mother who was sleeping in another room to tell her what had happened. They both returned to the kitchen and Harwood told them not to worry because she was going to tell officers the truth. However, when police arrived at the Aberdeen property she carried on with her lies and officers investigated the claims. Harwood ended up charged with wasting police time and admitted committing the offence when she appeared in court. Sentence was deferred until yesterday for a psychiatric and background report. But the sheriff could not deal with the case because she had not turned up for the psychiatrist appointment. Defence lawyer Graham Morrison told the court that his client suffered from an undiagnosed condition and was taking medication. He explained that Harwood hadn't turned up for her appointment because she had been suffering what she described as a 'black day'.

"President Barack Obama affirmed on Wednesday his administration's belief that the religion of violent extremists savaging Iraq and Syria is not relevant and should not matter. There is 'no one profile of a violent extremist or terrorist,' Obama said at the White House's summit on counter-terror measures. 'There is no way to predict who will come radicalized.' 'We are not at war with Islam,' Obama asserted. 'We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama speaks at the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism on Wednesday. Obama used the speech to explain his administration's position that the religion of ISIS terrorists doesn't matter . The White House on Wednesday was blitzed by reporters demanding to know when it believes that religion is meaningful in violent attacks. The Obama administration has been loathe to refer to ISIS as 'Islamic radicals,' arguing that the terrorist group's religion doesn't matter. Furthermore, it has at times failed to mention the religion of victims of barbaric assaults while at other times featuring it front and center. As foreign officials descended on Washington for the White House summit taking place next door, new life was given to the controversy and it threatened to overshadow the administration's confab. A statement sent to reporters on Sunday evening in which White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest condemned the 'despicable and cowardly murder of twenty-one Egyptian citizens in Libya by ISIL-affiliated terrorists' jump started the debate. Notably, Earnest did not mention that the 21 Egyptians were Christians and were killed by terrorist because of their faith. But two days before, after three, Muslim students were murdered in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, reportedly over an altercation involving a parking space, Obama said in a statement, 'No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship.' The statement implied that the students' religion and the assault were linked, even though local authorities had not yet come to that conclusion. Deeqo Jibril (R), the founder of the Somali Community and Cultural Association (SCCA) in Boston, listens to U.S. President Barack Obama speak at the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism. 'We are not at war with Islam,' Obama asserted during his speech. 'We are at war with people who have perverted Islam' At Wednesday's press briefing Fox News correspondent Ed Henry implored Earnest to explain why he did not say in his statement that the slaughtered Egyptians were also Christians and asked if the White House doesn't believe that information is 'relevant' to the crime. 'It sure is,' Earnest replied, 'because the ISIL extremists who carried out this attack indicated that the reason that they were killing them, wasn't just because they were Egyptian, but also because they were Christian.' Then why not say that? pressed Henry. 'I can't account for that specific line in the statement,' Earnest said, but we've been clear 'that we condemn the outrageous murder of these Egyptian citizens because of their Christian faith.' He pointed to an op-ed from the president that ran in the Los Angeles Times today as proof of the administration's position. In it Obama specifically states that 'the terrorist group we call ISIL has slaughtered innocent civilians and murdered hostages, including Americans, and has spread its barbarism to Libya with the murder of Egyptian Christians.' But why, Henry asked, did the White House feel it was necessary to immediately invoke religion when it came to the Muslim students even though the case is still under investigation. The White House has a principle, Earnest said that 'regardless of the faith of the individual in question, that people should not be targeted because of their religion, and what they look like or what their last name is or how they worship.' Obama said that last Friday, Earnest said, to articulate its own believes - and one the White House believes 'the vast majority of Americans should be able to support.' 'I think we've been very clear about what we call it and why we approach it in this way,' he said before moving on. Obama's spokesman was forced to revisit the topic of radical Islamism several times throughout the briefing, with CNN's Jim Acosta at one point saying to him, 'It just seems like you're tiptoeing through the tulips here' during a back and forth about the religious undertones of the White House's counterterrorism summit. 'Well I don't think I'm tiptoeing anywhere,' Earnest remarked. 'I think we've been pretty clear about exactly what we're trying to fight here. This is the summit on countering violent extremism.' 'And there is no question that radical ideologues around the globe have sought, and in some cases succeeded, in infiltrating some elements of the Muslim world to propagate their ideology and to try to distort that religion to justify their terrible acts of violence,' he acknowledged. He then bought up deceased al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, taken out by the U.S. in 2011. Earnest contended that the United States' refusal to declare a religious war between the West and Islam, according to bin Laden's writings, 'was frustrating his efforts to advance his radical agenda, it was frustrating the efforts of that organization to recruit new members, and it even prompted him to even contemplate changing the name of his organization to try to get people to identify them as a religious organization, as opposed to what they are, which is a terrorist organization.' That revelation, made after bin Laden's death, is a 'pretty clear indication' that the White House's strategy is working, Earnest said. Expressing his desire 'put an end to the tiptoeing - to the extent that there's been any,' Earnest said 'there is no doubt about the motivation of the individual who carried out this attack against a Kosher market in Paris. 'He was motivated by anti-Semitism, and he was targeting them because they were Jewish,' Earnest said, referring to another incident in which the White House muddied the waters with its changing stance on religion. Continuing, Earnest said, 'Public statements of ISIS in Libya indicated that they were killed because of their Christian faith. Demonstrating the administration's respect for religion, Earnest noted that the U.S. took action in Iraq last summer to help protect the Yadizi people escape ISIS. The U.S. has 'a long history, and a proud history' of taking action to protect classes of religious and racial minorities, he said, and 'it strengthens our moral authority around the globe, and it strengthens our national security.' At the summit Obama sought to further clarify his administrations beliefs, specifically calling the students, 'three young Muslim Americans.' He additionally lobbied the Muslim community to do a better job making it clear to the world that ISIS terrorists do not represent the whole of the Islamic religion. Muslim communities have a 'responsibility,' he said, to explain that ISIS and al Qaeda draw 'selectively' from Islamic texts. 'They do depend upon the misperception around the world that they speak in some fashion for people of the Muslim faith, that Islam is somehow inherently violent, that there is some sort of clash of civilizations,' Obama said. Proceeding, he said, 'Of course, the terrorists do not speak for over a billion Muslims who reject their hateful ideology. They no more represent Islam than any madman who kills innocents in the name of God represents Christianity or Judaism or Buddhism or Hinduism. 'No religion is responsible for terrorism. People are responsible for violence and terrorism. And killing in the name of religion, is 'not unique to one group, or to one geography, or one period of time,' the president said, echoing remarks he made a the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this month. Of ISIS, he said: 'They are not religious leaders - they're terrorists.' Obama rejected the notion that 'the West and Islam are in conflict' and called on Muslim leaders 'to do more to discredit the notion that our nations are determined to suppress Islam.' 'Everybody has to speak up very clearly that no matter what the grievance, violence against innocents doesn't defend Islam or Muslims, it damages Islam and Muslims,' he said. He encouraged 'older people' in the audience to get with the times and learn how to use social media if they want to help prevent the spread of radicalism. 'As wise and respected as you may be, your stuff is often boring compared to what they’re doing,' he said. 'You're not connected. And as a consequence, you are not connecting.'","There is 'no one profile of a violent extremist or terrorist,' Obama said. 'There is no way to predict who will come radicalized'

"A student loan would give most people the chance to broaden their horizons and improve their mind. But one undergraduate decided she was more interested in altering her body – and chose to spend all £10,000 of her loan on rounds of cosmetic surgery. Katerina Christodoulou, 21, was given an allowance by her family to cover her living expenses while she was taking her degree at the University of Essex. Christodoulou, pictured after her surgery, has quit her job as a training solicitor to become a model . Christodoulou, pictured in hospital after her breast operation, hated her shape so much she spent her student loan on £10,000 on numerous cosmetic surgery procedures . She also took out a student loan, hoping to save up the money for liposuction on her bottom, hips, thighs and knees. Christodoulou was taking her last set of English Literature exams when her final loan payment came through in April 2013. This . left her with enough money to fund the liposuction, and her boyfriend . at the time offered to cover the cost of a breast enlargement. The . graduate, who ended up earning a 2:1 in her degree, said: ‘I know that . some people might be quite surprised to hear that I spent my student . loan on my body, but it was worth it for how I feel now. ‘I . could have spent my loan on my studies but I was lucky enough to have a . supportive family who helped pay for my books and social life. ‘This allowed me to save my money. My parents gave me their blessing and were really supportive whilst I saved up.’ Christodoulou, pictured after her breast surgery and liposuction, said she doesn't regret spending the money on her body instead of a deposit on a house . Christodoulou was supported throughout university by her parents and was able to get by without the use of her loan, instead saving the money for her surgery . Instead of buying books for her English literature course at the University of Essex, Christodoulou bought liposuction surgery to remove stubborn fat from her thighs (left, before, right, after) Christodoulou underwent breast augmentation surgery at the same time as her liposuction as she found it difficult to buy bras due to her breasts being two different sizes . Christodoulou now boasts 32E breasts (pictured) having enlarged her natural bust . Christodoulou, . from Loughborough in Leicestershire, went on to ditch her chance to . earn a lucrative contract at a law firm in order to pursue a career in . modelling. She is about to . have another round of surgery – this time on her nose. ‘I’m a hundred . times more confident than before,’ she said, adding: ‘I did think about . using the money to put a deposit down on a house but then I thought why . not use the money to make myself happy now? ‘I hated my natural shape, so I had liposuction. ‘The . fat just wouldn’t shift, so I knew I couldn’t get rid of the excess . weight without surgery. And one of my boobs was a 32A and the other was a . B. They were deformed and it made buying underwear and bikinis . impossible. It really was a last resort.’ Explaining her decision to go . under the knife again, she said: ‘My nose isn’t awful or anything but it . could be better.’ However . this time she said she would not be paying for the surgery with her . student loan, adding: ‘I am going to get my nose job done on a finance . plan as I haven’t managed to save up for it so far.’ A . spokesman for MYA Cosmetic Surgery Clinic, which performed . Christodoulou’s procedures, said: ‘We believe everyone deserves to have . the body confidence that they desire. ‘Katerina is an excellent example of an intelligent women who wanted to improve her self-esteem.’ Christodoulou says that when she graduated she was delighted as she finally had saved enough for her surgery .

"Incredible images showing the cratered surface of the moon are the first ever to be taken with a 3D printed telescope. The £100 ($160) Pikon is able to produce images with a quality equal to telescopes that cost ten times as much, according to its designers. And with plans available to download online, anyone can create the telescope themselves – as long as they own a 3D printer which costs at least £400 ($650). Incredible images showing the surface of the moon are the first ever to be taken with a 3D printed telescope . Physicist Mark Wrigley, one of Pikon's creator, said he believed the telescope would be a 'game changer,' making telescopes available to the general public. Pikon uses a £25 ($40) Raspberry Pi camera module and is based on Isaac Newton's reflecting telescope design. The design involves placing a concave mirror to form an image of whatever the telescope is focused on directly onto the Pi camera sensor. The camera is mounted onto components created by 3D printing and, due to its small size, can sit directly in front of the mirror. The telescope has a magnification of times 160, which means that on a cloudless night it will be capable of detailed lunar observation as well as galaxies, star clusters and some planetary observation. £100 ($160) Pikon is able to produce images with a quality equal to telescopes that cost ten times as much .

"Wandering barefoot across a sun-kissed beach, David Cameron looks like he does not have a care in the world. But while the Prime Minister enjoys his second foreign holiday of the year, a shocking new humanitarian crisis has been unfolding in Iraq. Mr Cameron flew into Portugal for a 10-day family break on Saturday, August 2. Scroll down for video . Chilling out: The day after the Islamic State militant group overran the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq, David Cameron was photographed strolling along the white sands of a popular Portuguese beach . Hours later the feared Islamic State militant group overran the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq and drove up to 150,000 terrified members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes. The scale of the disaster emerged last Tuesday, when human rights groups revealed that tens of thousands of fleeing civilians, many of them children, were trapped on a barren mountainside with dwindling food and water supplies. The next day, Mr Cameron was photographed strolling along the white sands of a popular Portuguese beach. Wearing sunglasses and his trademark blue polo shirt as he carried his trainers in one hand, he appeared tanned and relaxed. Planned: And RAF aircraft flew Mr Cameron to Belgium, where he took part in First World War anniversary commemorations with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . At one point he balanced his sunglasses on the top of his head and gave a thumbs up to a passer-by. The Prime Minister did interrupt the start of his holiday in the seaside town of Cascais – but only for long-planned official events rather than to deal with the bloody crises in Iraq, Gaza and Ukraine. An RAF aircraft flew him back to Glasgow for the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony on August 3 and then on to France and Belgium for First World War anniversary commemorations. He returned to Portugal on a commercial flight at his own expense to rejoin his family. Mr Cameron, who also had a break in Lanzarote at Easter, will return to Downing Street in the middle of this week. But he and his wife will then leave Number 10 again later this summer for their traditional holiday in Cornwall  with their children Nancy, eight, Arthur, six, and Florence, 23 months. Time for tee: U.S. President Barack Obama has also faced criticism for flying off for his summer holiday, where he was pictured enjoying a round of golf with former American football player Ahmad Rashad . U.S. President Barack Obama has also faced criticism for flying off for his summer holiday on Saturday, just days after authorising American airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq. He, his family and their two dogs are staying in a rented house on the island of Martha’s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts. Mr Obama wasted no time on the first day of his two-week break before heading to the Farm Neck Golf Club for a round with a basketball star and a former American football player. The White House has been at pains to stress that the president remains in close contact with his advisers while he is away, and he will return to Washington for two days during his holiday. Mr Obama phoned German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the situation in Ukraine while he was flying to Massachusetts on the presidential jet Air Force One. French president Francois Hollande, whose country is helping the aid mission to help the Yazidi refugees, is also currently away on his summer vacation. But France’s foreign minister Laurent Fabius flew into Iraq yesterday to oversee the delivery of humanitarian supplies.","Prime Minister flew to Portugal for 10-day break on Saturday, August 2 .

"Nestled in tranquil countryside, Nixon’s Cottage was a treasured landmark for 600 years. Now it is facing demolition after a 174mph Audi estate car careered off the road – smashing straight into the living room of owners Andy and Karen Rattray. Structural engineers are examining the locally-listed wattle and daub thatched cottage to see if its ancient oak frame was twisted in the smash. Even if it is salvageable, the couple will have to move out for up to a year while the front of their home is rebuilt. Fortunately, Mrs and Mr Rattray were not in at the time of the crash at their home in Over Peover, . Cheshire, and the driver of the £55,000 Audi RS4 car was uninjured. Scroll down for video . Inspection: Structural engineers attended to assess the damage before the Audi car could be removed . Damage: Andy, 46, and Karen Rattray, 44, were out at the time of the crash in Over Peover, Cheshire . Smashed: The Audi car went into a 600-year-old oak-framed wattle and daub section of the living room . No injuries: The driver of the Audi - worth £55,000 - and the couple's three cocker spaniels were unhurt . Long wait: Mr Rattray said it will be up to 12 months before the couple can go back into their cottage home . Somewhere to stay: Mrs Rattray said the driver 'gets to go home to his nice warm house and we don't' The . Audi driver had been going along the A50 towards Knutsford just before . 9.40am on Monday, when a Volkswagen appeared to be travelling on the . wrong side of the road in the opposite direction. Cheshire Constabulary officers said . the Audi driver took evasive action, mounting the grass verge before . going across the road, through the hedge and coming to a halt in the . lounge of the building. The driver of the 2012 Audi and the couple’s three cocker spaniels - who were inside the house - were unhurt. The . couple's living room is completely destroyed however, along with . several antiques including a grandfather clock which Mr Rattray said is . still standing but beyond repair. Police are now trying to trace the driver of the Volkswagen, which was a dark blue car. Mrs Rattray said: ‘This is the third time we have had a car come through the hedge but this is by far the worst - we live in fear. Thank God we weren’t in the living room. The method of constructing buildings . using the wattle and daub technique dates back to the Neolithic period . and is thought to have helped develop later methods of construction . including lath and plaster and even cob. Wattle and daub was used in parts of central Europe, western Asia, and north and south America. It involves woven lattice strips of wood, called the wattle, being daubed with a sticky paste to hold it together. The paste was traditionally made from materials at hand, including animal dung and straw or mud and clay. ‘If we were we would have all been in the lounge and we had a great big unit in front of the window. That’s obliterated and there are bricks embedded in the wall. ‘We have to find somewhere to stay . now and that’s hard with three dogs. The driver gets to go home to his . nice warm house and we don’t.’ Fortunately for the couple and their dogs, a local farmer has offered to rent them a house while work continues on theirs. Structural engineers attended the scene to assess the damage before the car could be removed. Mr . Rattray said: ‘It is going to be six to 12 months before we can go back . in - we don’t know yet if the house will have to be knocked down. ‘The . part the car went into is 550 to 600 years old - it’s just wattle and . daub, and we don’t know if the oak frame has been twisted.’ ‘We . heard a noise the night before and my dogs had been going mad. We . thought a car had gone through the hedge so I went to look the morning . after and there was a hole in it. ‘I . got there and just saw this car sticking out of the hedge and the . driver was just stood there looking very pale and shaken. I thought it . had happened the night before but it had happened literally a few . minutes before.’ Whatever happens to the old house, Mr Rattray may have a job on his hands persuading his wife to move back to the property. Historic: The part of the Cheshire cottage that the Audi car went into is an astonishing 550 to 600 years old . Evasive action: Cheshire Constabulary officers said the Audi driver mounted the grass verge before going across the road, through the hedge and coming to a halt in the lounge of the building . Crash: Mrs Rattray said it was the third time the couple have had a car come through the hedge in Cheshire . Shock: Mr Rattray (left) said he 'just saw this car sticking out of the hedge' next to the property in Cheshire . Accident: The Audi RS4 was driving along the A50 towards Knutsford at around 9.40am on Monday . Carnage: The cottage was an absolute mess following the crash which took place on Monday morning . Worry: Mr Rattray said the couple were unsure as to whether the house will have to be knocked down . He told MailOnline: 'If the building has to be knocked down, it would be nice to rebuild further back from the road as it's a lovely area. 'But my wife is afraid to live here again, so I don't know if we'll return.' Mr Rattray described the dangerous stretch of road as 'crazy' with several motorists killed in crashes since he moved in to the house 14 years ago. He said that the road is particularly busy when the motorway is closed and large lorries use the route as a diversion. 'A truck would have gone straight through the house,' he said. The last serious incident on the road before the Audi crash saw an 18-year-old girl killed in a crash close to Mr Rattray's home. Danger spot: A previous crash at the cottage saw a car come over the hedgerow upside down. It was only stopped from hitting the property by another parked car . The house came close to suffering serious damage last year when another car came over the hedgerow. Mr Rattray said: 'It came through the hedge upside down and it was going to hit the property, but fortunately we had a car parked there and it hit that and was pushed along the side of the house instead.' The technique of wattle and daub dates back 6,000 years. Wattling is the building of walls by weaving sticks in and out of upright posts - and daubing is the weather-proofing with manure, earth and clay. The house, known as Nixon's Cottage, is thought to have been home to local prophet Robert Nixon. Born in the 15th century, he became known as the Cheshire Ploughboy Prophet and is said to have predicted the Battle of St Albans and the outcome of the Battle of Bosworth field. He is even said to have foretold his own death. Nixon was summoned to the court of Richard III but refused to go saying that he would be 'clemmed' - or starved - to death. King Richard ordered that he be keep in the court's kitchens but he was caught stealing food from the pantries and locked in a cupboard by the cook. He was left in the cupboard and starved to death when the cook was called away. Close call: A previous crash saw a car land on its roof just inches from the house . Before: The interior of Nixon Cottage before the car plowed through the wall . Ruined: The car came through the wall into a 600 year old part of the house . No protection: The historic cottage is hidden behind a row of bushes, but it isn't enough to stop cars ploughing through it . Dangerous stretch: The Rattray's home is situated right next to the busy A50 road .","Damage to Andy and Karen Rattray's cottage in Over Peover, Cheshire .

"Killed: The family of Lance Corporal Tom Keys, who was killed by a mob in Iraq, said it 'beggared belief' that Chilcot is withholding the 150 letters and calls discussing their plans to go to war in 2003 . Families of British troops killed in Iraq reacted angrily to the news that the Chilcot inquiry will not publish the full exchanges between Tony Blair and George Bush. They said the agreement to include only quotes or 'gists' of the messages and conversations meant they would never learn the full truth about the decision to go to war. Reg Keys, whose 20-year-old son Lance Corporal Tom Keys was one of six Red Caps killed by a mob in Iraq in 2003, said it ‘beggared belief’ that Mr Blair and Mr Bush were being allowed to ‘get away with it’. He said inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot would have his hands tied by the failure to get permission to publish the classified documents in full. Mr Keys, 62, from Solihull, West Midlands, said: 'I'm not happy with it at all. I want to know the reason why my son gave his life for his country. 'I don’t want the “gist” of it. I want the whole truth and nothing but the truth. ‘This isn’t some minor bit of legislation going through Parliament like the fox-hunting Bill. 'We need all the details that led up to the war, which was a war of option, not necessity. ‘Parliament has been misled, the general public have been misled, but worst of all those troops have been misled. ‘We need to see the full story. It is very, very important as part of closure for those who have lost loved ones. 'And there are also people who have been maimed, crippled or blinded – they may want to know why they sustained those injuries. ‘If there is nothing to hide, why hide it? If Bush is so proud of what he did, release all the documents.’ Secrets: The . hold up in the publication of the Chilcot report is down to a . disagreement over what can be published from the notes and conversations . between George Bush and Tony Blair in the run up to the war . Rose Gentle, 50, from Glasgow, whose son Gordon Gentle, 19, was killed in Iraq in 2004, told the BBC the relatives of those who died were disappointed by the decision and now felt they would not get to the truth about why Mr Blair took Britain to war. 'Now a lot of families think: “What was the point? What is going to be the outcome? Is it just going to be covered up now?” 'I think they should be released for the families to see them, because we’re going to wonder for the rest of our lives what was in it.'","Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot will hold back leaders' 150 secret calls .

"Oprah Winfrey, David Geffen and Larry Ellison want to buy the embattled LA Clippers from disgraced owner Donald Sterling. The three billionaires with a combined wealth of $60 billion revealed on Wednesday that they have formed a consortium to take over the NBA team in the wake of 80-year-old Sterling's lifetime ban from the league. Television entrepreneur Winfrey, is joining forces with the world's fifth richest man, Ellison and entertainment mogul Geffen to pry the franchise from Sterling's grip - after he revealed he would not sell the team he bought for $12 million in 1982. Scroll Down for Video . Partners: Oprah Winfrey (seen here on Tuesday) leaving the CBS Studios in New York City has confirmed that she and David Geffen (right) want to buy the LA Clippers . Interested party: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison watches the Los Angeles Clippers face the Golden State Warriors in Game Three of the Western Conference Quarterfinals during the 2014 NBA Playoffs at Oracle Arena on April 24, 2014 in Oakland, California . Confirming the move with ESPN's Jeremy Schaap, Winfrey's representative said that she is 'in discussions with D. Geffen and L. Ellison to make a bid for the LA Clippers should the team become available.' Geffen said he and Ellison would run the team, while Winfrey would be an investor. Speaking directly to Geffen, worth $6.2 billion, Schaap posted to Twitter that the DreamWorks founder is determined to buy the Clippers with the Oracle founder, who is worth $49.3 billion. 'Larry would sooner die than fail. I would sooner die than fail. Larry's a sportsman, we've talked about this for a long time. Between the three of us, we have a good shot.' Geffen said that Winfrey, worth $2.9 billion was ready to take on ownership of the team, who are currently in the playoffs. 'She thinks it would be a great thing for an important black American to own (another) franchise.' Adamant: Despite the high level of interest in buying the franchise he has owned for 32-years, Donald Sterling has declared he has zero intention of selling the LA Clippers . Despite his self-declared love of the LA Lakers, Geffen said that as a basketball supporter his enthusiasm and business know-how would only benefit the Clippers. 'I'm a fan, I bring something to the table with the success I've had in many areas of the entertainment industry, it's fun and I can afford it.' Most industry insiders estimate that Sterling will rake in up to $780 million if he is forced to sell the LA Clippers by the NBA's Board of Governors. However, despite the celebrity billionaire bid, Donald Sterling is refusing to sell his team - signaling a lengthy and costly legal battle with the NBA. Long-time friends: Oprah Winfrey and David Geffen pictured in November 2012 in Los Angeles . Friends: Lary Ellison (left) with his son David and his wife Melody and David Geffen (right) at a screening of the 'Flyboys' in September 2006 . NBA commissioner Adam Silver has told Sterling that he wants him to sell the Clippers as part of the extreme sanctions brought against the owner in response to racist comments he was recorded making by a former girlfriend. 'I fully expect to get the support I need from the other NBA owners to remove him,' Silver said. The NBA on Tuesday banned Sterling from the game for life and fined him $2.5 million for racist comments that drew a storm of outrage from players, fans, commercial sponsors and even President Barack Obama. However experts have said that Sterling, a lawyer and real estate tycoon could tie up the sale for the rest of his life. 'It would be an absolute disaster,' said Richard Sheehan, the author of 'Keeping Score: The Economics of Big-Time Sports', to the LA Times. Laying down the law: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced that Donald Sterling will be banned from the sport of professional basketball for life and will not allowed to be involved in the business of the LA Clippers . Under fire: Sterling was interviewed by NBA investigators and they determined that it was his voice on the tape and he did hold the 'hateful' views . They point out that there is not clear legal authority for the NBC to force Sterling to sell because of private remarks. 'It's distasteful, it's disgusting, but what he said is still ostensibly private conduct,' Robert Boland, an NYU sports management professor told The LA Times. Sports Illustrated said that the three-quarter procedure to force a sale is based on financial difficulties not punishment. Geffen, is a music and film mogul worth $6.2 billion and tried to buy the Clippers in 2010 for $600 million but was turned down by Sterling. However, if the battle to buy the Clippers becomes a bidding war, only a handful of men have more money than Ellison. Geffen, who started two record labels and the Dreamworks film studio with Jeffrey Katzenberg and director Steven Spielberg, had expressed interest in the past in buying the Clippers but never made an offer. Sterling, the longest-tenured owner of any of the 30 NBA teams, will be barred from any role in the operations of his team or be able to serve as one of the league's governors, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said at a news conference in New York. The controversy began over the weekend when the celebrity website TMZ.com released an audio recording ostensibly of Sterling criticizing a woman friend for associating with 'black people.' Recording: The racist comments were made on a phone conversation between Sterling and his girlfriend V. Stiviano (left) and the NBA investigation determined it was his voice on the tape . Hiding: Stiviano, who works as a model, has been using visor hats to keep her hidden from cameras (pictured Monday) in light of the scandal but she has denied leaking the recording . Boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. and music mogul Sean Combs both claimed interest in buying the team Tuesday, as did real-estate tycoon Rick Caruso.","The three billionaires have formed a consortium to take the LA Clippers from current owner Donald Sterling .

"BBC's iPlayer catch-up TV services will be coming to a million more British homes later this year as part of Sky's TV service. It will play through normal Sky HD boxes . Broadcaster BSkyB announced a new internet TV service today which will allow British households to pay to download films without a contract or a satellite dish. It will launch in the first half of this year, and quickly expand to offer sport and entertainment from Sky's premium channels . The service will be aimed at the 13 million households who do not subscribe to pay-TV - and will also allow Sky to fight back against high-profile web-TV services Netflix, Lovefilm and the upcoming YouView. The new service will work via smartphones and tablets, internet-connected 'smart' TVs and games consoles. Sky's TV sales will face growing competition with the launch in the summer of YouView, an internet-connected set-top box involving the BBC, ITV and BT. And the recent expansion into the UK of Netflix, which allows customers to pay to download movies, and the Lovefilm download and rental business adds a further threat to satellite TV's former monopoly on providing films and premium TV channels. The new service was announced as Sky revealed a further slowdown in the number of households that signed up to its TV services to 40,000 in the three months to December 31, down from 140,000 in the same period a year ago. Sky also announced it is to create 1,300 jobs over the next two years in the UK and Ireland as it brings more of its customer service and installation work in-house and opens a new service centre in Dublin. BC's iPlayer catch-up TV services will also be coming to Sky customers later this year. It will play through normal Sky HD boxes. The catch-up TV service will be available via the AnyTime Plus internet TV service.

"A Dutch creationist is putting the finishing touches on a full-size replica of Noah's Ark, which he has built according to a blueprint set out in the Bible. Johan Huibers spent three years and more than £1.03million constructing the gigantic wooden boat - and now has his sights set on sailing it up the Thames for the Olympics. This feat of true biblical proportions was inspired by a dream Mr Huibers had 20 years ago, in which he saw part of his native Netherlands submerged in a flood like the one featured in the Book of Genesis. Faithful recreation: Johan Huibers's replica of the ark, in Dordrecht, in the western Netherlands, is now open to the public . Miracle worker: Mr Huibers poses with two of the life-size plastic animals that live on his 450ft ark . He has been obsessed with bringing the story of the ark to life ever since, MSNBC reports, and in 2004 he built a half-scale version and floated it along the country's canals. Long before the metric or imperial systems came along, craftsmen in various parts of the world dealt in less precise units known as cubits. As this was based on the length of a forearm, the exact value varies from one ancient civilisation to the next. It is most commonly defined as the distance from the elbow to the middle fingertip. The Biblical cubit is generally thought to be about 18in, but Ancient Egyptian cubit rods measure closer to 20in. Tourists flocked to see the smaller prototype when Mr Huibers opened it to the public, but the proceeds from admissions went straight back into funding his ambition to build a full-size ship. The narrative of the ark, in which God commands Noah to prepare for a great flood sent to purge the world of evil, specifies that the boat was 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high. Mr Huibers converted this ancient unit of measurement, which is based on the length of the forearm, to determine that his recreation had to be about 450ft long. This puts the boat, which opens to the public on Monday and is nicknamed 'Johan's Ark', at more than half the length of the Titanic. Two by two: A crocodile and cow are among the fake creatures on board the boat, which weighs almost 3,000 tons . Biblical proportions: A plastic giraffe pokes its head over the bow of the ark, which was inspired by a dream . And though it may not be able to shelter two of every animal, as the original story dictates, it can hold 1,500 people - not to mention a menagerie of life-size plastic creatures including giraffes, elephants and donkeys, as well as a few live chickens. As it weighs in at almost 3,000 tons and is made from Swedish pine reinforced with steel, it may be hard to believe that the ark is, in fact, seaworthy. It is docked in the western city of Dordrecht, where Mr Huibers, the owner of a construction company, pieced it together with the help of some friends and two of his children. In the 15th century, the city was the site of one of the deadliest floods in history, named St Elizabeth's flood, which is thought to have claimed as many as 10,000 lives. Prototype: The half-scale replica that Mr Huibers built in 2004, later floating it through the Netherlands' canals . Ambition: Mr Huibers stands in front of two model elephants on his first ship in 2007 .

"Coal miners in sixties Britain might have had to get up before dawn and work all day in the cold, dark and damp, but the women in their lives look like they might have had much more fun. Their daughters, wives and sisters - and women who worked for the coal board - could enter the glamorous Coal Queen beauty contest. The competition started out in the early sixties and by 1969 it was a national event, with the Coal Queen of Britain scooping prizes from holidays to clothes and money. Deborah Tate, from Ashington, was crowned Northumberland Coal Queen in 1982, aged 19. She is pictured here at the opening of a new pit bath complex at Ellington Colliery in January 1983 . One such Coal Queen is Deborah Tate, who grew up in Ashington and was crowned Northumberland Coal Queen in 1982, aged 19. 'It was a great honour to represent your community and usually came with prizes - a real treat,' she tells MailOnline. 'My . father Albert Bramley was a miner who had worked at Woodhorn Colliery - as were the two generations before him. 'Dad always used to tell me I could grow up and be a Coal . Queen, but I'm not sure I really believed him,' said Deborah, now 51 . and living in Ponteland, Northumberland. 'It . was incredible - one day you were nobody, and the next mams were . whispering to their children, ""Look, it's the Coal Queen"". It was an . honour,' Deborah told Chronicle Live. 'It was . very exciting,' said Deborah, who has kept her family connection to . Woodhorn by working as marketing officer for the colliery museum. 'Mining families didn't have a lot of money, so going to Blackpool was a fabulous holiday. 'We were treated as something special and my family were very proud. The Coal Queens were mascots for the industry.' Deborah Tate, circled, on the way to Blackpool in October 1982 for the national finals of the Coal Queen competition, with girls from coal fields  all over the UK. The national winner for the year stands behind Deborah . Coal Queens L-R Northumebrland  1983, National 1977 and Deborah, Northumberland 1982 . The competition in 1982 was held at a dinner in a local hotel the night before the Northumberland Miners' Picnic. Local National Union of Mineworkers representatives made up the judging panel as well as Neil Kinnock who was there to speak at the event the following day. 'The young ladies paraded around in both a day dress and swimwear, and a compere chatted to each one to find out a little bit about them - what their connection was, their interests, ambitions and more,' says Deborah. 'I guess they were looking for an attractive, personable lady who could proudly represent the community for the next 12 months. 'As winner, I was given a sash, tiara, and I think a small cheque, but I was also to go through to the national final in Blackpool in the coming October. Later I was give £50 I think to help with my preparations for the final. 'The big event in Blackpool was amazing to me. It was a huge industry celebration and there were all sorts of other things going on including football tournaments and music. 'We were transported first class to the top hotel with our chosen partner - hubby, sister or in my case, mum - where we stayed for a week. 'One of the event sponsors was a catalogue, so we spent part of the week rehearsing a big fashion show at the Opera House in the Winter Gardens as well as preparing for the main competition. 'We got to know each other very well and really had fun together. It really didn't feel like a competitive environment - just a group of young girls having a great adventure together. 'All of the young ladies were given a watch by Rotary just for reaching the final, and again, I think there was a small cheque. The winner won a gold watch, a bigger cheque and a holiday to St Lucia! 'I've still got my dress from the final and the gold sandals I bought for the event. The watch is still in the jewellery box too, although I'm not sure it works.' Coal Queens on parade at the Northumberland Miners' Picnic - pictured centre in blue is the Picnic Queen and right in the red sash is the Northumberland Coal Queen . Deborah . passed on her crown to her 26-year-old friend Jackie Grey, now 57, whose . father was a safety engineer at Bates' Pit. Jackie was Northumberland's . very last Coal Queen. Competitions were initially run at a . local colliery level and winners would be crowned at local Miners' Galas, but in the late 1960s they became organised into . Coalfield and national competitions. The last national competition was held in . 1983. The mining community had many events celebrating the industry and bringing the community together. The Miners' Picnic was an annual gathering of the Northumberland coal community, where miners and their families would listen to union and political speakers, watch brass bands parade and compete, enjoy a fair and stalls. It celebrated 150 years this year. The photograph with various young ladies . on a lorry, above, was taken at one such Northumberland Miners' Picnic. Pictured in . the centre in blue is the Picnic Queen and to the right in the red sash . is the Northumberland Coal Queen.

Deborah Tate has continued the legacy of her family and the mining community by following in their footsteps. 'I'm the fourth generation to work at Woodhorn . colliery,' she says. 'Which was a working coal mine for more than 80 years and is . now a museum and home to Northumberland Archives.' Deborah now works at the Northumberland Archives . at Woodhorn Museum, where they've released beautiful archive images for . the public to view on Retronaut, and now here on MailOnline.

"Since Nasa’s mission to Mars got under way on August 6, the Curiously Rover has beamed some astonishing images back to Earth that have left scientists and amateur star-gazers alike scratching their heads and envisioning UFOs. But even seasoned alien watchers were puzzled when the rover making its way through the Red Planet send back the image of what appeared to be a fossilized human finger. YouTube user StephenHannardADGUK, part of a group called Alien Disclosure UK, who had caused a stir on the Internet last week after pointing out white ‘flying objects’ zooming across the Martian sky called attention to a collection of ‘mysterious’ items he spotted in a video from Gale Crater. Ancient digit: A YouTube user claimed that the rover stumbled upon an ancient, fossilized human finger, which in reality is likely just a rock . Martian footwear: Another rock that caught the attention of the UFO enthusiast made him think of a long-forgotten shoe or sandal on the surface of the Red Planet . ‘Mars Curiosty(sp) captures a possible ancient finger, a dome shaped object, a shoe or sandal and a possible Martian creature,’ Hannard wrote in the video description. ‘Are these anomalies real, tricks of the light or something else, as always you decide.’ The image shows what appears to be a rock shaped like a digit with a faint outline at one end that vaguely resembles a fingernail. Another rock found nearby resembles an overturned sandal, and a crevice on another geological formation looks like a smiling Martian critter, NBC reported. Nasa, however, has so far made no ground-breaking announcements regarding the discovery of life forms – or Martian footwear, for that matter - on the Red Planet, leaving UFO enthusiasts guessing and wondering. On August 18, Hannard posted footage in which he applied a series of filters to a Curiosity, revealing what he claimed to be four objects resembling flying saucers hovering in the sky. Martian life form: An image of a rock with a crevice in the middle vaguely resembles a grinning extra-terrestrial critter . ‘Four objects caught by Mars Curiosity, very difficult to make out on original image so I have used a few filters to highlight,’ he said in the video description. ‘What are these four objects? UFOs, Dust particles, or something else? As always you decide.’ Experts, however, came out saying that the four ‘objects’ are actually just dead pixels in the rover's CCD camera — single points in the camera's imager that have lost functionality and register as white. Marc D'Antonio, a photo and video analyst for MUFON [Mutual UFO Network], told Huffington Post, ‘I fully concur at this point that these are dead pixels on the imager. All CCD (cameras) have them, and in a bland atmosphere like that at Mars, they would be very obvious as opposed to an active atmosphere like Earth, where they could end up hidden for a long time before anyone noticed them.’ UFO or camera snafu: The same relentless web user posted footage in which he applied a series of filters to a Curiosity image, revealing what he claimed to be four objects resembling flying saucers . Theory debunked: Experts came out saying that the four 'saucers' are actually just dead pixels in the rover's camera . The YouTube video - posted by a Stephen Hannard - puts the photograph through many different filters to try to find more clues as to their existence. A fourth blob can be seen to the top of this image . Just two days after the rover touched down on Mars, back to Earth caused many UFO hunters to perk up. It seemed that Nasa has itself captured something very strange on camera, including a strange white light dancing across the horizon of the red planet, and four blobs hovering in the sky . While the images are certainly a curiosity, Nasa and photography experts insist that these are nothing more than blemishes on the images, picked up by the camera lens sitting on the rover at a distance of 350 million miles away. So what are the Mars anomalies? View the videos below: . 1) Some internet users claim to be able to see a speck of light rapidly traversing the Martian horizon on the images below . 2) It may not look like much, but on the dry and barren Mars landscape, any movement is unexpected - and some claim to be able to see a light which apparently lifts itself off the ground below . 3) On some returned images from the Curiosity, strange pinpoints appear in the . sky - are they spaceships, or just abnormalities on the camera? So far, Nasa has not commented on any of the strange sightings, but alien hunters have suggested these are alien ships monitoring our baby steps into the universe. Curiosity, a six-wheeled vehicle the . size of a compact car, landed inside a vast, ancient impact crater near .

"A holidaying family stumbled upon a huge 17-foot Burmese python as they picnicked in the Everglades. The collosal snake, one of the mostly deadly in the world which kills by asphyxiating its victims and swallows dead prey whole, was shot by the Park ranger after it emerged from the bushes. A video shows the dead snake seeming to go on forever as it is dragged into the open. Those watching comment that they believe it was pregnant - with one adding: 'We really wanted to get it before it laid all its eggs'. Scroll down for video . The Burmese python, like the one pictured, was spotted by the family as they picnicked in the Everglades, Florida . A person stands by and watches as the dead python is dragged from the bushes in the video captured by tourist Richard Blount . The snake was spotted in the Florida beauty spot by the Blount family, from Arkansas. Bryan Blount said they came across the python about 3pm  on Wednesday and his father, Richard, took the pictures and video of the snake which he sent in to wesh.com. The park ranger confirmed it was a Burmese python and shot it with a shotgun. Florida is holding a Burmese python . hunting contest beginning in January where a grand prize of $1,500 will . be awarded to the person who kills the most pythons, and $1,000 will go . to the person who bags the longest one. But despite the game visitors to Florida and the Caribbean were warned earlier this year to watch out for giant Burmese Pythons after they began moving into areas popular with tourists. In Florida, the main Burmese Python colony has for decades been . Everglades National Park in the west of the state and it was hoped that . the surrounding saltwater lakes and waterways would provide a natural . barrier to stop them moving east. The snake seems to go on forever as it is pulled out into the picnic area in the Everglades, Florida . Those standing around watching the dead snake being drawn out into the open commented that they believe it was pregnant . But reptile experts found that even newly-hatched pythons - which can grow to 20ft long and weigh 200lbs - can survive in seawater for up to a month. Although they are not considered a threat to humans, Burmese Pythons are vicious and can eat anything from birds to large mammals. In October 2011, a 16-foot python was found with a 76lb deer in its stomach after it was shot dead. A six-foot American alligator was found protruding from the mid-section of a 13-foot Burmese python in the Everglades National Park in 2005. The effort to eat the alligator killed both animals . And in 2005 another Burmese python was discovered split open with a 6ft alligator in its stomach. Florida’s problem with the reptiles dates back decades and has become so severe that residents have been banned from keeping pythons as pets. The cause of the epidemic has been blamed on either importers bringing them in from their native south-east Asia or Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which destroyed a number of facilities which were holding thousands of Burmese pythons.","The Burmese python hunting contest begins next month .

"Former Army chief Lord Dannatt said Mr Hammond 'showed our hand' Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has been accused of ‘showing our hand’ to ISIS fanatics holding hostage a British aid worker after admitting the Government did not know where he was. Mr Hammond said the SAS was unable to mount a rescue operation to save Alan Hemming because ‘we don't know where he is’. He said it would be a ‘different story’ if the Government did know. But the former head of the Army Lord Dannatt said he was ‘surprised’ by Mr Hammond's remarks. He told the Telegraph: ‘I am quite surprised by him saying that. At the public level, not to have commented in that way would have kept uncertainty in the minds of terrorists. They would have remained concerned. ‘He could have said privately to the family that we're doing all we can, but please keep that to yourself because we would rather the other side did not have the information. ‘Not to have revealed our hand as openly might have been a different course of action to take. He was trying to be open and helpful, but it might have been better to say that to the family privately. He would appear to have shown our hand.’ Mr Hammond's remarks came after David Cameron vowed to ‘hunt down’ the fanatics which killed British hostage David Haines. Mr Haines became the first Briton to be murdered by a man believed to be the ‘British’ terrorist known as ‘Jihadi John’, who has previously beheaded two American journalists. In the footage, released on Saturday night, the terrorists threaten to murder 47-year-old Mancunian Mr Henning. Mr Hammond was yesterday asked why the SAS cannot simply mount a raid to rescue Mr Henning, he replied: ‘Because we don’t know where he is. It’s as simple as that. ‘If we knew where he was we would be able to look at all sorts of options. We have considered every possible option to support kidnap victims, both British and others. If we knew where they were it would be a different story.' Scroll down for videos . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the SAS could not launch a rescue mission for captive Alan Hemming - because the Government did not know where he was . He added: ‘We understand Mr Henning’s family are going through hell. We are doing everything we can to protect him but they understand the limitations of our abilities and that we are dealing with a very barbaric organisation whose values are completely different from ours.’ Mr Hammond was speaking after a summit in Paris where Europe and Arab states joined the US in pledging to fight Isil ‘by any means’. It is not the first time Lord Dannatt and Mr Hammond have publicly disagreed over Syria. Three weeks ago, Mr Hammond firmly rejected the suggestion by the former chief of the general staff that Britain and the US should have ‘a conversation’ with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad because they would need his approval for a bombing campaign in Syria. The US yesterday began its expanded bombing campaign in Iraq as General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he would consider recommending US military advisers – Special Forces – joining attacks, a move that would place American boots on the ground nearly three years after they pulled out. The US already has an estimated 1,600 military personnel in Iraq. Hostage: Alan Henning was captured just minutes after he arrived in Syria to help with an aid convoy . Gen Dempsey said the US was not preparing to unleash a ‘shock and awe’ campaign of overwhelming airstrikes in Syria against IS fighters, but would ‘degrade’ IS’s capabilities. US and UK intelligence have been working ‘indirectly’ with Syrian officials in the hunt for jihadi leaders and their hostages in Raqqa, IS’s operational headquarters. The city is the focus of a massive intelligence gathering operation, involving drone spy planes, electronic monitoring and surveillance.","Philip Hammond: UK can not launch rescue mission for Alan Hemming .

"Engineers at Duke University have designed a breakthrough gadget that 'harvests' background microwave radiation and converts it into electricity, with the same efficiency as solar panels. The development, unveiled on Thursday, raises exciting possibilities such as recharging a phone wirelessly and providing power to remote locations that can't access conventional electricity. And the researchers say that their inexpensive invention is remarkably versatile. It could be used to capture 'lost' energy from a range of sources such as satellite transmissions, sound signals or Wi-Fi. The future: The device that is capable of harvesting microwave signals from the air consists of five fiberglass and copper conductors wired together on a circuit board . The Duke engineers used metamaterials, which their press release describes as 'engineered structures that can capture various forms of wave energy and tune them for useful applications.' They say the device harvested microwaves with an efficiency of 36.8 percent, similar to modern solar cells that capture light energy. A report that will appear in the journal Applied Physics Letters in December states that this invention is capable of converting microwave signals to enough direct current voltage to recharge a cell phone battery. The gadget, created by undergraduate engineering student Allen . Hawkes, graduate student Alexander Katko and lead . investigator Steven Cummer, consists of five fiberglass and copper conductors wired together on a circuit board. It is capable of providing 7.3V of electricity. As the press release points out, current  USB chargers provide around 5V. Hawkes said: 'We were aiming for the highest . energy efficiency we could achieve. We had been getting energy . efficiency around 6 to 10 percent, but with this design we were able to . dramatically improve energy conversion to 37 percent, which is . comparable to what is achieved in solar cells.' Proud: Alexander Katko (left) and Allen Hawkes (right) pioneered the breakthrough. 'It's possible to use this design for a lot of different frequencies and types of energy, including vibration and sound energy harvesting,' said Katko . His colleague, Katko, added: 'It's possible to use this design for . a lot of different frequencies and types of energy, including vibration . and sound energy harvesting. 'Until now, a lot of work with . metamaterials has been theoretical. We are showing that with a little . work, these materials can be useful for consumer applications.' Possible uses for the new technology include building metamaterial into homes to ensure Wi-Fi signals are not just lost. Electrical products could also have a device attached to increase efficiency by ensuring that excess power is not wasted. In theory, the invention could also be used to beam signals from phone towers that could then be converted into electricity. Electronic devices could be recharged wirelessly or electricity sent to remote areas without power cables. Power: The device harvested microwaves with an efficiency of 36.8 percent, similar to the solar cells installed on this California home in a file photo . The researchers explained that a series of the power-harvesters could even capture signals from satellites passing overhead. This could allow for electricity in hostile environments such as mountaintops or deserts. Cummer said: 'Our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to electromagnetic power harvesting. 'The beauty of the design is that the basic building blocks are self-contained and additive. One can simply assemble more blocks to increase the scavenged power.'","Device captures microwaves and converts them into electricity .

"A British jihadist fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq has boasted of preparing for ‘martyrdom’. Reyaad Khan also claimed he is planning on ‘fireworks’ – sparking fears that he could be part of a wave of suicide attacks against US interests in the north of the country. The 20-year-old former student from Cardiff has already featured alongside two other Britons in a recruitment propaganda video for the terror group released in June. Scroll down for video . British jihadist: Reyaad Khan, 20, a former student from Cardiff, has boasted of preparing for 'martyrdom' Among a series of vile postings are pictures of beheadings, a fighter holding a severed head by his hair, mass executions and corpses. In his latest tweet, Khan wrote: ‘Spent the day with 2 German brothers waiting 2 do martyrdom ops. The waiting list is so long, we got fireworks for US when they return.’ Significantly, he yesterday tweeted a picture of the door of a US vehicle – supporting claims that Islamic State had captured American military hardware and weapons that belonged to retreating Iraqi forces. Monitoring of Islamic State’s communications has picked up English being spoken near the captured northern city of Mosul. Khan’s claims will also give weight to the belief that Britons have crossed from Syria into Iraq to join foreign fighters besieging tens of thousands stranded in the Sinjar mountains. Officials fear the militants could now be . planning an offensive in the Kurdish city of Irbil – just 25 miles from . Islamic State front lines – as well as suicide attacks against . Americans. Post: In his latest tweet, Khan wrote: 'Spent the day with 2 German brothers waiting 2 do martyrdom ops. The waiting list is so long, we got fireworks for US when they return' British and US interests in Irbil and the capital Baghdad have been on alert for suicide attacks and yesterday more American citizens left the country after intelligence warnings.

'Spent the day with 2 German brothers waiting 2 do martyrdom ops. The waiting list is so long, we got fireworks for US when they return' Reyaad Khan . The former student grew up in a terraced house in the Welsh capital in the same road as Abdul Miah, one of the ringleaders of a foiled plot to unleash a Mumbai-style terror attack on London. Former schoolmates remembered him as a talented scholar who had moderate views and mixed well with people of all backgrounds. But last year his interest in religion appeared to intensify and he successfully applied to study at the Madinah University in Saudi Arabia, although he did not take up the position. He is thought to have joined Islamic State last year, appearing on a recruitment video in June. In the footage, he can be seen cradling . an assault rifle while sitting with fellow Cardiff students Nasser . Muthana, 20, and his 17-year-old brother Aseel. Vile postings: Khan has used Twitter to post a series of gruesome pictures and sickening boasts . Since then he has used Twitter to post a series of gruesome pictures and sickening boasts. He wrote on July 5: ‘Executed many prisoners yesterday.’ It prompted another fighter from Portsmouth to reply: ‘Epic executions bro, we need to step it up like the brothers in iraq.’ 'Probably saw the longest decapitation ever. And we made sure the knife was sharp' Reyaad Khan . Three days later, he tweeted: ‘Probably saw the longest decapitation ever.

Gucci, give me a shout.’ His messages and images stopped for a period before reappearing several days ago. Yesterday there were postings suggesting he was eating a meal with fellow Islamic State fighters while watching a beheading. Several pictures showed severed heads or headless corpses.

"Told to move: Lily Dove, 95, is one of the 1,500 people who have been 'de-registered' from the medical practice in Watton, Norfolk . Lily Dove has used her GP practice for so long that she remembers when the doctor would visit on a horse and trap. Now the 95-year-old great-grandmother is being removed from its register because so many newcomers have moved into the area. Some 1,500 people are being taken off the database by the medical practice in Watton, Norfolk, which has struggled  to recruit enough new GPs to cope with the market town’s rapidly growing  population – many of them Eastern Europeans. Mrs Dove was shocked and upset to  be . told she would be ‘de-registered’ within a fortnight and would have to . move to a different clinic. When she complained she was told no exception could be made for her because it would be ‘discriminatory’. Mrs Dove, a widow from the nearby village of Ashill, has lived in the area since her birth in January 1919. She . suffers from a number of health problems, and now fears that her . failing eyesight means it would be dangerous for her to start using an . unfamiliar surgery in the next nearest town, Swaffham. She said: ‘I am deteriorating a bit. Life is difficult enough without having to change my doctor.’ Mrs Dove lived for 88 years on an . arable farm in the village of Stow Bedon, which was run first by her . father John, then by her husband Ellis, and finally by her son John. She moved out when he sold it four years ago and now lives on her own in a bungalow. Extra care comes from her family and a cleaner who comes once a week. Regular . check-ups at the surgery are essential for the great-grandmother, who . is on medication for diabetes, cholesterol and heart problems. After an . operation for arthritis and a recent painful fall on her left hip, she . also needs a walking frame to get around. A letter was sent to Mrs Dove from the surgery in Watton apologising, but telling her that it would be discriminatory towards others forced to move if they had let her stay with them . She . said: ‘I’ve been with the Watton surgery all my life, as were my . parents before me. 'In fact when I was tiny the doctor came out in his . horse and trap – although of course you had to pay in those days. This . letter from the surgery just came out of the blue. ‘There was no question of discussing . it with you or anything. When you can’t see very well, you could easily . fall over. I should be very nervous going to Swaffham.’ Local services are under increasing pressure because of Watton’s expanding population. New . housing developments have attracted so many new residents – many of . them Eastern Europeans attracted by farm work in the rural county – that . public services are struggling to cope. Mrs . Dove said: ‘This problem has been going on for some time. Why didn’t . they make a fuss before and get help then instead of letting it get to . this state?’ Safety fears: Mrs Dove's son John, 71, is worried his mother will struggle with the change due to her age and health . Her son John Dove, 71, added: ‘She was very upset by the letter. 'Having been a patient there all her life, she was annoyed. She just doesn’t want to change. 'She doesn’t know Swaffham – with her failing eyesight she knows where she’s going in Watton. 'You can’t keep pulling people into a rural area without putting bits and pieces in place to deal with them.’ One of Mrs Dove’s friends, who is in her 80s, has also been told she must switch to a new GP nearly ten miles from her home. Watton Medical Practice manager Mary Osborne said there was a ‘national crisis’ in GP recruitment, with 40 unfilled vacancies across Norfolk alone. The clinic already has vacancies for a nurse practitioner and two GPs – and another two family doctors are expected to leave by the end of the year. ‘This is a matter of patient safety and we have acted out of concern for ongoing patient care and patient safety,’ she added. ‘We were informed by the local area team for NHS England that we could not be discriminatory and ask some residents to move and ask others to stay – that would have been unlawful. 'The decision was made on geographical area, where there is an alternative practice to cover a patient’s primary care.’ NHS England said it understood the pressure on the surgery but felt it was ‘regrettable’ that patients were being de-registered. Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said every patient should be able to see their GP when they need to – but the situation facing the profession  made it increasingly difficult. ‘De-registration of patients only takes place as a very last resort, and only when there could be a threat to patient safety,’ she said. ‘This is a consequence of the desperate shortage of GPs in many parts of the country, which is leaving the service teetering on the brink of collapse – with the greatest impact being felt on patient care.’","Lily Dove, 95, has been 'de-registered' from her GP in Watton, Norfolk .

"Ally McCoist insisted the perilous financial position at Rangers does not make him immune from the sack. But the Ibrox boss remains confident he can overcome current criticism and fulfil his remit by guiding the club back into top-flight football. McCoist has been on the receiving end of heavy flak after Monday evening’s grim 3-1 home defeat from Hibernian left Rangers six points adrift of Hearts. Ally McCoist claims that no manager is completely safe from losing his job . Some fans have questioned whether the settlement package due on his current £400,000 per year earnings simply makes his dismissal too expensive for the board to consider. The Ibrox outfit were forced to launch a stop-gap £3.13million share issue last month and could face another cash shortfall by the end of the year. But McCoist said: ‘I don’t think anyone is bombproof. I wouldn’t sit here for a minute and say I’m bombproof. I’m still wearing the flak jacket but nobody is bombproof.’ Asked if suggestions that he was only still in place for financial reasons were hurtful, McCoist replied: ‘I don’t find that insulting at all. I don’t necessarily agree with it. I don’t think there has ever been a manager at all who hasn’t been sackable. Sections of the Ibrox faithful jeered their team after the shock 3-1 home defeat to Hibernian . ‘So I don’t think about that at all and it doesn’t annoy me that people have said it. I’ve got far too much on my mind, concentrating on the positives and moving forward.’ Former players and pundits have delivered scathing critiques of McCoist’s tenure this week, with ex-Hearts midfielder Michael Stewart accusing him of failing to coach his players properly. ‘I am not going to sit here and tell you it’s enjoyable when you are getting stick,’ said the 52-year-old, who declined to address any individual remarks. ‘Of course it’s not. But I have a real acceptance that it goes with the territory. If Walter Smith can get Nine-In-A-Row, get to the UEFA Cup final and get dog’s abuse then it is fair to say that we will get our fair share of criticism. I just want to get the job done.’ Hibernian star Jason Cummings celebrates his second goal in front of the Rangers fans . The Hibs reverse followed an earlier victory for Hearts at Ibrox, but McCoist sees no need for panic as he takes his team to Livingston this afternoon. ‘I accept that criticism is going to come with the two defeats,’ he said. ‘But it is my job to do something about that. We are less than a fifth into the season. There are miles and miles to go. ‘It is important that we don’t get carried away after good performances. And I am not going to get too upset after a 3-1 defeat at home to Hibs. I made a point of checking and, in 2010, we had a team that had nine guys who played in the UEFA Cup final that lost 3-0 to Hibs at home. Three years before, Ivan Sproule scored a hat-trick for Hibs in another 3-0 loss. ‘Now that is not a fob-off. We were beaten 3-1, we had a mad 20 minutes, we need to do something about it. But it is not unique. Rangers will be without Bilel Mohsni (R) at the weekend after he was banned for lashing out at Liam Fontaine . ‘There is nothing that’s happened this season which has shocked us. We knew right from the word go it was a step up.’ The Championship play-offs would provide a back-up option if Rangers fail to close the gap on Hearts. ‘Getting out of the division is the most important thing,’ added McCoist. ‘We will take whatever we can to get out of this division because it is so important for the club to get back into the top flight as soon as possible.’","Rangers manager Ally McCoist insists he is not 'bombproof' from the sack .

"'Attention seeker': Mathew Davis, 22, posted a message on the toilet door mid-flight so he could 'save the day' A British Airways steward who wrote a bomb threat on a jet’s toilet door mid-flight so he could 'save the day' as a hero and get a promotion was jailed for six months today. 'Attention seeker' Mathew Davis, 22, was a member of the crew on the Boeing 777 flight from London to Tokyo with 150 passengers on board when he posted the message claiming there was a live bomb on the plane that was going to explode mid-air. The note read: 'The bomb on board will explode at 16.00GMT unless our demands are met' and he showed it to terrified stewardess Sarah Jane Spencer when the plane was 35,000 feet over the Middle East. She spent the rest of the flight checking her watch believing her time had come but in reality it was a hoax by Davis so that he could tell the captain and get a promotion. Judge Anna Guggenheim QC, who noted it was 'highly dangerous behaviour', said: 'This is an extremely serious example of a bomb hoax. 'Several hundred people aboard a plane at high altitude is a common thing in our world but they are extremely vulnerable. 'You wanted to create a crisis in order to be seen to equip yourself well, to be seen well by your employers, to rise in the estimation of your employers, putting it shortly to be a hero. 'Had you been believed the extent of the chaos and disruption and fear would have been very great indeed.' Davis 'found' the message and told the captain and Ms Spencer but luckily the 'highly experienced' pilot realised it was a hoax almost immediately. Because of the captain’s 'good judgement' the plane did not make an emergency landing and 'hundreds of lives, international air traffic and emergency services' were not deployed but he still caused 'extreme fear' to his colleague, the judge noted. The note read: 'The bomb on board will . explode at 16.00GMT unless our demands are met' and he showed it to . terrified stewardess Sarah Jane Spencer when the plane (file picture) was 35,000 feet . over the Middle East .

'She went to where . one of the loos was at the back of the airplane and discovered a message . written on the back of the door which read 'The bomb on board will . explode at 16.00GMT unless our demands are met'. 'She . immediately said she was shaken and terrified and she actually did . believe there was a bomb on the plane and she was constantly looking at . the watch and checking the time.'

His handwriting matched that on the back of the toilet door. Davis, . whose mother committed suicide when he was younger, was taken off . duties but only arrested when they returned to Heathrow. Police searched . the jet, but no explosives were found on board. Mr . O’Connell said: 'He explained he was having some difficulty at work . financially and he was hoping he might be able to get a promotion and he . came up with the ill conceived idea that if he was seen to deal well . with a crisis style situation it might help him with the promotion.' Davis made the threat on board the Boeing 777 flight from to Tokyo with 150 passengers on board (file picture) When he pleaded guilty to a single charge of communicating false information with intent at Isleworth Crown Court Judge Guggenheim noted he has a 'history of highly unusual acts which could be described as attention seeking, but which are potentially dangerous.' Sam Bonner, defending, said that it was written so only staff would see it. She said: 'It was done in such a way where he would be able to contact the captain and save the day. There was no intention to cause mass panic or terror to those on the plane.' 'What he ridiculously thought was that he would be able to notify the captain and be calm in the situation and deal with it well and therefore be looked on notably by his employers. 'This was an act where he attempted to appear heroic and wanted approval from his workplace.' Judge Guggenheim said: 'He plainly in the future shouldn’t be employed by any airline or in any position of trust such as this.' Davis, of Crawley, West Sussex, lost his job at BA after the hoax.","Mathew Davis showed the message to a terrified stewardess when the plane was flying over the Middle East .

Linda, a health care worker in a nursery school, said: ‘ I worked so hard to lose all the weight on my own but being left with all that skin was awful. ‘It was like wearing a permanent rubber ring of skin around my waist. ‘I used to wear two pairs of tights to try and smooth it down but nothing could flatten it. ‘But now I’m about to turn 40 and in the best shape of my life which is not bad considering I was once told I was so fat that wouldn't live to see it.’ Linda began struggling with her weight as a teenager. When she started her first job as a trainee hairdresser she admits spending all her money on takeaways. She explains: ‘ It was a special treat to have a take away so when I started earning my own money I started treating myself. ‘I’d have chips or an Indian meal for supper after work.’ But soon she was spending money on bacon rolls for breakfast and fish and chips for lunch too. She was already a size 20 weighing 17st when she met engineer husband Gary aged 20. Linda from Greenock, says: ‘ He wasn’t bothered about my weight at all so after we got together I just kept on eating and growing. Locked in a cycle of self-loathing and comfort eating Linda's weight continued to rise and she became breathless even from walking . Despite wishing to slim she just couldn't ditch the take away meals - until later that year her doctor delivered a stark warning . Four years later the couple holidayed in the Canary Islands with Linda weighing 24 stone and a dress size 26. She says: ‘I was sweating buckets the whole time we were there. I tried to cover up in t-shirts but that just made me ever hotter. ‘I was so big even walking left me out of breath. It was horrific. I watched the other women on the beach in bikinis and wished it was me.’ But all attempts to diet failed as Linda was locked in a cycle of self-loathing and comfort eating. She was even bigger when the couple flew to Florida on holiday in 2000 Linda was mortified to need a seat belt extension on the flight. She recalls: ‘ It was so embarrassing. I was worried I wouldn’t even be able to fit into the seat.’ But there was more shame to come when she realised she was too fat to fit into any of the rides at Disneyland. She says: ‘I was queuing for a rollercoaster when staff took me to one side and said I needed to sit in the sample seat to make sure I would fit. ‘I followed them and sat down but the seat belt wouldn’t close. I was told I was too big to ride.’ She fled and was too embarrassed to try any other rides. ‘ I knew it would be the same. I couldn’t believe we had wasted so much money going there.’ But it was in 2003, the year she married Gary, that her weight peaked and she reached a dress size 32. She says she tried almost every bridal shop in Glasgow looking for a dress in her size and eventually had to order one from America. She says: ‘ Even then it was so tight I could barely breath and being so uncomfortable ruined the day.’ The years of overeating had left a giant flap of skin known as an apron hanging from her stomach and she was told she would need surgery to remove it . But she was mortified when in 2006 a child at the school where she worked drew a picture of her as a big round blob. Linda says: ‘ She gave it to me as a present and I just took it home and cried. Bless her she had no idea it had upset me but she was right, that was how I looked.’ But despite wishing to slim she just couldn’t ditch the take away meals - until later that year her doctor delivered a stark warning. Aged just 32 and weighing 24st 7 lb, Linda was warned she would not live to see her 40th birthday unless she lost weight. She recalls: ‘ He didn’t mince his words. He said I would suffer a heart attack and die unless I lost weight.’ Linda ate a strict diet of only fresh fruit, vegetables and lean meat to drop the pounds . He offered to refer her for gastric surgery but Linda was determined to try again to lose the weight herself. This time she joined a local slimming club and in the first week in January 2007 lost a stone. The diet involved eating only fresh fruit, vegetables and lean meat. Linda says: ‘I hadn’t eaten like that for years and was surprised to actually enjoy it.’ It took four years for Linda to lose 13st 7lb and reach her goal weight of 11st. She says: ‘I set little goals and worked towards them. It took years to get that big I knew it wouldn’t come off overnight.’ Finally in 2011 she reached a size 12. She says: ‘ I felt fantastic and was happy in my clothes but underneath that there was a problem.’ The years of overeating had left a giant flap of skin known as an apron hanging from her stomach over her pubic area. Linda was so ashamed of it she rarely let her husband see her naked and was still unable to wear clothes she liked. She tried to disguise it with spanx and even considered wrapping it in cling film. But even worse were repeated skin infections caused by the folds of flesh rubbing together. She says: ‘ It would get very sweaty and inflamed and my GP was always prescribing antibiotics and creams to calm it down. ‘I never regretted losing the weight but I felt disappointed that I couldn’t enjoy it as I hoped because of the skin. I just hoped if I kept exercising it would go.’ Eventually in 2012 she spoke to her GP who confirmed her worst fears, that the skin would need to be surgically removed. He referred her for the procedure known as an apronectomy, but before being given the green light Linda first needed to demonstrate that she would indeed keep the weight off. Linda, pictured with her husband Gary, went bikini shopping for the first time in her life just weeks after her surgery, snapping up four different costumes to wear on a holiday to mark her 40th . She said: ‘I had maintained for a long time by then so I was confident that I would pass the interview.’ Finally she was offered an appointment with a surgeon in December 2013 who agreed she would be a good candidate. She went under the knife on January 14th this year – leaving hospital a full six pounds lighter after the operation. She now weighs 10st 8lbs and went down from a size 12 to a size 10 bringing her total loss to 14st. Weeks later Linda went bikini shopping for the first time in her life, snapping up four different costumes to wear on a holiday to mark her 40th. She says: ‘Once I was told I would be dead by 40, now I’m marking the occasion by wearing a bikini. ‘It feels amazing and I am so grateful to the surgeon for doing such an amazing job. It really has changed my life. ‘I’m fitter and healthier than I have ever been and now thanks to the surgery I can finally enjoy all the hard work.’","Linda was locked in a cycle of self-loathing and comfort eating .

"Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing increasing questions over his leadership. He was pictured last night at the Attitude Magazine Awards . Ed Miliband last night warned Labour MPs that their chances of winning the next election will ‘slip away’ unless they stop sniping at his leadership. In a desperate plea for unity, Mr Miliband appealed to MPs to rally behind his faltering leadership – or risk being punished by the voters in May. Mr Miliband has been rocked by criticism of his leadership style and priorities in the wake of Labour’s lacklustre party conference and near-defeat to Ukip in last week’s Heywood and Middleton by-election. Last night's crunch meeting comes amid growing concern over Labour’s poor poll ratings – with the party barely ahead of the Tories in national surveys. Mr Miliband is also struggling to convince voters that he is a future Prime Minister. Addressing a private meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party at Westminster last night, he insisted victory was ‘do-able’, but warned it would be thrown away if Labour descended into infighting. ‘Normally after an election defeat we show disunity and division,’ he said. ‘Instead, we have had four years of unity. I am not going to let us, seven months before an election, start lapsing into the bad habits of the past. Things are going to be more difficult. There will be ups and downs which make the last few weeks look easy. I know that we will pass that test.’ Mr Miliband was given a polite hearing by most MPs, although several attacked him over the party’s slump in the polls and failure to address the Ukip challenge. Yesterday veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell said Mr Miliband needed to 'get out more' and meet ordinary voters - and accused him of being 'hapless' in big speeches. Referring to the Labour leader's conference gaffe, when he 'forgot' to mention the deficit in his set piece speech, Mr Mitchell said: ‘Ed is a marvellous bloke. 'When he’s out with the people he’s okay, but he needs to get out with the people more. ‘He is a bit hapless in these set-piece speeches where he forgets things. If you’ve forgotten something don’t tell the world you’ve forgotten something – shut up.’ Ed Miliband pictured with media entrepreuner Lord Alli, a Labour supporter, at the Attitude Magazine Awards . It comes after a survey released yesterday revealed that voters now judge Mr Miliband to be almost as bad a leader as far-left pin-up Michael Foot, who led the party to its worst modern defeat in 1983. A total of 22 per cent of voters think Miliband better than Foot, while 21 per cent favour Foot. Mr Miliband is seen as a worse leader that Gordon Brown, Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair. Voters think Labour would be better off if Mr Miliband was replaced – with 54 per cent say Labour would fare better if he goes while just 6 per cent say the party would benefit from him staying. Labour MPs have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of Mr Miliband as the general election approaches. Former Labour leader Michael Foot led the party to its worst defeat in 1983 against Margaret Thatcher . Graham Stringer, MP for Blackley and Broughton, admitted Mr Miliband was 'not an asset' on the doorsteps, and urged him to sack some of his close advisers. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett meanwhile suggested that Labour should underplay the fact that Mr Miliband is their leader during the election. Despite pressure, the party has insisted it will not respond to the threat posed by Ukip by supporting Government targets to cut migration. But officials promised Labour would say more on the issues of integration of immigrants, reducing their exploitation and ensuring they make a larger contribution before they receive benefits.","Labour is barely ahead of Tories in  polls and Miliband is under pressure .

"Shock: Former BBC Radio 1 DJ and TV  presenter, Mike Smith, pictured with wife Sarah Greene, died in hospital on Friday from complications following major heart surgery . Mike Smith may have kept his health problems secret from some of his friends before his death. The former BBC Radio 1 DJ and TV  presenter, who was 59, died in hospital on Friday from complications following major heart surgery. It was also claimed yesterday that the DJ never got over the death of a young man on one of his TV shows in the 1980s. Michael Lush, 25, died after falling 120ft while rehearsing a bungee jump stunt for The Late, Late Breakfast Show, which Smith co-presented with Noel Edmonds. It is believed Smith had not told a number of his closest friends in showbusiness, including fellow Radio 1 alumni Edmonds and Mike Read, that he was unwell. ‘Mike’s death was a shock for Noel,’ said a source close to Edmonds yesterday. ‘He saw him only six or seven months ago and he looked all right to him then.’ Another former colleague also said he had not heard about Smith’s health issues, adding that he appeared well when they last met at a media industry gathering within the past year. Former TV producer Mike Hollingsworth continued: ‘He seemed absolutely fine. Like all of us he was getting a bit older and perhaps a bit slower, but it never struck me that there was any problem in his life.’ Mr Hollingsworth, who worked with Smith on BBC Breakfast Time in the 1980s, also said the broadcaster was haunted by Mr Lush’s death in November 1986. The day after Mr Lush’s fall, Smith cancelled his Radio 1 show, describing it as a ‘terrible time’ after he and Edmonds met Mr Lush’s family. Mr Hollingsworth, who was once married to former TV-am presenter Anne Diamond, said: ‘He carried it with him. I always thought he unfairly carried the can for a large part of that. To be honest, it never appeared to be his fault.’ He paid tribute to the former DJ, who moved from presenting to set up a company called Flying TV which provides helicopter filming services for broadcasters. ‘He brought a touch of sanity to things which could easily have got out of control – the Noel Edmonds show was a particular example. He was particularly good at keeping his feet on the ground,’ he said. ‘There are so many people who don’t know when the time has come to take a back seat or give way to others coming up. Scroll down for audio . Michael Lush, 25, (left) died after falling . 120ft while rehearsing a bungee jump stunt for The Late, Late Breakfast . Show, which Smith co-presented with Noel Edmonds . Double act: It is believed Smith had not told a number of his closest friends in showbusiness, including fellow Radio 1 alumni Noel Edmonds that he was unwell . ‘He knew exactly how to do that both in his DJ career and when he became a current affairs presenter. He knew that his particular era was over and he changed careers. He was the sort of guy to reinvent himself very well.’ Smith presented Radio 1’s flagship breakfast show between 1986 and 1988, when Princess Diana named him as her favourite DJ. He also hosted Top of the Pops and the coverage of Live Aid in 1985, as well as a number of quiz shows. Smith is survived by his wife, the former Blue Peter presenter Sarah Greene. They married in 1989, a year after they were both injured in a helicopter crash in Gloucestershire. They did not have children. Miss Greene thanked the staff at the hospital where her husband died for their care and compassion, and asked for her family and friends to be allowed to mourn him in peace. Edmonds said in a statement: ‘I am totally stunned and heartbroken for Sarah and his family. ‘He was so much more than simply a presenter. Mike was that rare individual – the consummate broadcaster in an era when professionalism, dedication and hard work were truly valued. I am typing this through the tears. I wish I had told him more forcefully and frequently how much I admired his talent and valued his support.’ Mike Read added: ‘Mike was a very affable guy, fantastically business-like. It’s a real loss and has come as quite a shock.’","Former BBC Radio 1 DJ, 59, died from complications following heart surgery .

"Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its iPhone. Two concept images have emerged that show Apple’s next-generation handset with a slender chassis, as well as a larger 5-inch screen similar to those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One. The first concept predicts the phone - dubbed the 'iPhone Air' - will be 4.5mm thick, while the second goes a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom. Scroll down for videos . Concept images have emerged that show Apple's next-generation handset with a super-thin slender chassis. This concept, by Italian-based firm SET Solution, predicts the handset could be 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom, in order to retain the home button . Up until August last year, Huawei was the . record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, . at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm.

In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, Fuse Chicken's concept - dubbed iPhone Air - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls . By comparison, Apple's current iPhone 5S, pictured, has a depth of 7.6mm. This makes it 1.7mm thinner than the iPhone 4S and 1.37mm thinner than the iPhone 5C . Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air (pictured) which is 20% thinner than previous models . SET Solution’s concept, instead, keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top. It also appears taller than Fuse Chicken’s version in order to fit the larger screen. Apple’s iPhone has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the iPhone 5S would be the first to break the 4-inch mark - but it didn't. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand. However, with main rivals Samsung, HTC and Nokia releasing phones with screens in the 5-inch region, analysts claim Apple may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people. Last November, designer Martin Hajek created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the iPhone's screen size, without drastically increasing the size of the handset. In his image, the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges. However, because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident, when it’s picked up for example, the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced. According to Forbes journalist Anthony Wing Kosner: 'The only way I could see something that thin working for users, is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket.' He continued that if Apple was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest, which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis, it could also pave the way for foldable devices.

It has been widely accepted Apple's rumoured 4.7-inch iPhone 6 (concept pictured left) will debut in September, with the 5.5-inch model launching in 2015. This was blamed on manufacturing problems.

"The sadistic brutality of the British jihadi who beheaded James Foley was exposed by the reporter’s fellow hostages yesterday. The former captives said the Islamic State fanatic they knew as ‘John’ was the ringleader of a macabre gang that held them for months in appalling conditions. John and his fellow British jihadi ‘Beatles’, Paul and Ringo, saved their most vicious beatings for Mr Foley. The sadistic brutality of the British jihadi who beheaded James Foley (left) was exposed by the reporter’s fellow hostages. The former captives said the Islamic State fanatic they knew as ‘John’ (right) was the ringleader of a macabre gang that held them for months in appalling conditions . As the security services closed in on John’s identity, it also emerged that: . At John’s orders the hostages were moved to different locations at least ten times to ensure they could not be rescued. Astonishingly, he was responsible for negotiations with the families of the hostages, including Mr Foley’s – and it is even thought he spoke to them via Skype. However, his demands for money were refused, leading IS to cease communications before last week issuing a final chilling message informing his family that he would be executed in retaliation for American airstrikes. He is said to have successfully brought in millions of pounds by brokering ransom deals for at least eight international hostages this year alone – underlining his huge importance to the IS movement. The Briton questioned the hostages about their families, before exploiting the information in emails and on Skype to build pressure. Didier Francois, a war reporter and prisoner for eight months, said Mr Foley and other hostages had to endure the mock executions a number of times. In a massive joint manhunt by US and Britain, GCHQ and NSA are both tracking the source of the YouTube video showing the beheading of Mr Foley by John, in an effort to trace how and where it was loaded . The 53-year-old said: ‘One of the last  times I saw him before leaving, this  group – which has a taste for the macabre – made him stand in a crucifix pose against the wall. ‘It is for that reason that when I am asked what I think about the hostage-takers’ motive for executing him, I say I think that they had simply decided to execute him. Period.’ Asked if he recognised Mr Foley’s killer, Mr Francois said: ‘Recognised is a very big word. I see roughly who it is.’ He said all of the hostages were threatened with death. French journalist Nicolas Henin spent seven months in captivity with the 40-year-old Mr Foley whose beheading on video by the British jihadist sickened the world, and for one week he was handcuffed to him. ‘Being an American he was probably more targeted by the kidnappers,’ he said. ‘He would be beaten a bit more probably, he was some kind of scapegoat. ‘What we most suffered from during the first part of our imprisonment was lack of food. The cold, too – we had no hot water. John and his fellow British jihadi 'Beatles', Paul and Ringo, saved their most vicious beatings for Mr Foley . ‘I kept on the clothes in which I had been captured from the first six months. We had so few shoes that we were using to go to the bathroom that we were sharing them. ‘The shoes that James Foley was wearing when he was taken to this place in the desert (to be murdered) I wore them too.’ David Cameron has now told intelligence and security chiefs to make the identification and location of the British trio an absolute priority. In particular they have been instructed to locate John, the fanatic clad in black who carried out the beheading while speaking with a London accent. Anti-terror investigators believe he and his fellow Britons are still in Syria close to the IS stronghold of Raqqa. British military signals experts have been moved to northern Iraq to monitor IS communications, seeking to ‘capture’ transmissions that can be passed back to the government’s spy centre in Cheltenham. In a massive joint manhunt by US and Britain, GCHQ and NSA are both tracking the source of the YouTube video showing the beheading of Mr Foley by John, in an effort to trace how and where it was loaded. Both MI6 and MI5 as well as their US counterparts are said to have had him on their ‘radar’ for more than a year. But senior security officials admit that even with his identity and location, ‘getting to him’ would be especially hard while he remains inside Syria. The US revealed yesterday that a secret mission into Syria to release Mr Foley and other hostages – and kill the captors – this summer had failed. It ended in a firefight with jihadists after an intelligence failure. Mr Francois said Mr Foley was singled out for beatings after his captors found pictures on his computer of his brother, who is in the US Air Force. He said conditions in captivity were ‘rough and sometimes violent’ with food and water in short supply and the sound of the bloody civil war always in earshot. ‘They regularly came to get from us evidence that we were alive, making videos and asking questions to which only our families would know the answers,’ he added. ‘Every time we were taken to a new place of detention, they told us they were going to free us to make us keep quiet during the journey.’ He said the American was ‘an extraordinary kid, a superb journalist’, ‘extremely strong’ and who ‘never cracked despite extremely difficult conditions’. An advisor to the US administration said  last night that it had not ruled out  strikes inside Syria. Launching a criminal investigation into Mr Foley’s killing, Attorney General Eric Holder warned: ‘We have long memories and our reach is very wide and we will not forget what happened. People will be held accountable one way or another.’ US Special Forces had attempted  a daring airborne raid on the British jihadis holding James Foley, it  emerged yesterday. The ‘substantial and complex’ mission took place earlier this summer, and was authorised by President Barack Obama. Under the cover of darkness, two dozen members of the elite Delta Force and support teams were dropped by helicopter into an oil refinery, in a sparsely populated area of north Syria. US Special Forces had attempted a daring airborne raid on the British jihadis holding James Foley, it  emerged yesterday . Intelligence had indicated that the British militant known as John and his Islamic State associates were holding James Foley in a nearby hideout – but once the US forces fought their way there, the captives were nowhere to be found. The Americans then battled to a rendezvous point, where they were airlifted to safety. Details of the operation emerged hours after the IS terror group released a grotesque video of Mr Foley’s murder, sparking criticism that the US had not done enough to free the journalist. It is unclear exactly when the mission took place, or whether it had any bearing on IS’s decision to kill Mr Foley, who had been held for 22 months. After French and Spanish hostages held with Mr Foley were released earlier this year, intelligence officers discovered that US captives were being targeted with mental and physical torture. As an American with siblings in the US military, Mr Foley had been singled out for particularly harsh treatment, including mock executions. A trio of Britons – dubbed ‘The Beatles’ by their captives – are said to have taken charge of the prisoners while huge ransom demands were made. The 'substantial and complex' mission took place earlier this summer, and was authorised by President Barack Obama . US officials said their rescue attempt had focused on a particular IS group, believed to headed by the Britons. The ground offensive – the first time American troops had fought directly with IS fighters at all – was fraught with danger, as US forces flew into Syrian territory in defiance of the regime’s air defence system which was said to pose a ‘real threat’ to pilots. Modified Black Hawk helicopters were involved, with drones providing cover to ground forces described by the Pentagon as ‘the best of the United States military’. One commando suffered a minor injury and several IS fighters were killed. A US defence department official said: ‘By the time we got there, it was too late.’ It may only have been ‘a matter of hours, perhaps a day or two’ since the hostages had been at the hideout, he added. He stressed that IS ‘did not know who they were fighting that night, and we assess Syria did not know [either]’. The families of US hostages were told of the operation after it had been launched. Caitlin Hayden, spokesman for the National Security Council, said the US government had ‘never intended to disclose this operation’ but did so after details began to leak out. White House counter-terrorism adviser Lisa Monaco said: ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the remaining hostages’ families and their loved ones during this difficult time. ‘The US government had what we believed was sufficient intelligence, and when the opportunity presented itself, the President authorised the Department of Defence to move aggressively to recover our citizens.’ Intelligence agencies had been collecting data on the suspected location of the hostages for months, giving them confidence to proceed with the mission. Syria’s government denied any US operation had taken place inside its territory, although it does not control large areas where IS operates. ‘It did not happen that American war planes attacked terrorist positions in Syria, and that will not happen without the consent of the Syrian government,’ information minister Omran Zoabi told the Syrian news agency SANA.","‘John’ was the ringleader of a macabre gang which held hostages .

"The nine-day-old baby who died after being given infected feed through a hospital drip was a twin and his brother is still in hospital, it emerged yesterday. Yousef Al-Kharboush died on Sunday after contracting a deadly bacterial infection from the intravenous fluid at St  Thomas’ Hospital in London. His father, Raaid Hassan Sakkijha, yesterday told of his agony at seeing his son suffer. He called for the  contaminated feed blamed for his son’s death to be withdrawn from production so no other children would fall victim to the same fate. New tragedy: A second baby fed on a contaminated drip died today, ten days after nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush died in the premature unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London . Hours after he spoke out, it emerged . that three more babies had been infected – bringing the total number of . vulnerable infants struck down with blood poisoning to 21 across ten . hospitals in England. This is despite the pharmaceutical company that . manufactured the product, ITH Pharma, insisting on Thursday that there . was ‘no reason’ for any more families to be concerned because the rogue . batch had been withdrawn. At a pre-inquest review at Southwark . Coroner’s Court yesterday, Mr Sakkijha described his agony at watching . as his tiny son deteriorated and then died last Sunday. His surviving . baby, Abdullilah, remains in hospital. Officials confirmed a baby at Peterborough City Hospital has tested positive test for Bacillus cereus . A baby at Basildon Hospital in Essex has a suspected case of the bug which has not been confirmed . ‘My son has just died and I . don’t want more children to die,’ he said. ‘If you look at Yousef, he . was dying because of this product. If you could see Yousef, he was . suffering. He died because of this.’ The twins were placed on life . support after being born eight weeks premature at St Thomas’ on May 23. But Yousef, who weighed just 1lb 9oz at birth, fell seriously ill on May . 30 when infected with the bacterium bacillus cereus, apparently as a . result of being given the contaminated feed. He died two days later. Mr . Sakkijha, who also has two older children aged seven and ten, asked . health officials whether investigations into the contamination would . consider if any children could be affected when they grow older. ‘How do we know that the solution will not affect babies at a later stage, maybe after one or two years?’ he said. ‘How can you guarantee this will not happen? Is that part of the investigations?’ He said he hoped that the inquiries into his son’s death would save other children. ‘I . was hoping to hear this product would be completely stopped from . production until they make sure that ... no other babies are being . contaminated,’ he said. Karen Hamling, the managing director of . London-based firm ITH Pharma, said further batches would not be supplied . until investigations are complete. ‘We are co-operating with all of our . regulatory  bodies because we want to ensure something like this never . happens again,’ she told the hearing. It was announced yesterday that . three new cases of infection had been found at Stoke Mandeville . Hospital in Buckinghamshire, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in .

"Its last political correctness row was over the use of the N-word. Now, the BBC is once again under fire. Only this time, the dispute involves a rather less offensive term ... girl. The corporation was accused of censorship after cutting the ‘G-word’ from a documentary on the Commonwealth Games. Beaten by a ... BBC presenter Mark Beaumont is floored by Cynthia Rahming from the Bahamas . During the programme, presenter Mark Beaumont, 31, was flung to the ground by a young judo champion, and joked: ‘I am not sure I can live that down – being beaten by a 19-year-old-girl.’ His remarks were aired in full when the documentary, called The Queen’s Baton Relay, was first broadcast on the BBC News Channel in April. But fearing viewers might take offence, the corporation decided to edit out the word ‘girl’ when it was repeated last week. Critics, however, attacked the move. Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘They are finding offence where none is taken or intended. ‘We are going to end up in a situation where nobody is going to dare say anything lest some politically correct zealot deems it offensive.’ Mr Beaumont, a record-breaking cyclist and adventurer, also questioned why the cut was necessary, writing on Twitter: ‘Maybe the editor thought it was sexist – it wasn’t. I’m not worried about it.’ Even the teenage judo champion in question, Cynthia Rahming from the Bahamas, was baffled. ‘I wasn’t offended – I didn’t find it sexist,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. The row comes a fortnight after the BBC was criticised for forcing veteran Radio Devon DJ David Lowe to quit for mistakenly playing an old version of The Sun Has Got His Hat On featuring the N-word. 'Zealots': Tory MP Philip Davies warned we could end up in a situation where no-one dared say anything in case they were accused of being un-PC . By contrast, Jeremy Clarkson kept his job despite appearing to mumble the same racist term in unaired Top Gear footage. In the judo documentary, Mr Beaumont follows the baton tour through Commonwealth countries ahead of the Games in Glasgow in July. Feminist novelist Kathy Lette also joined the storm of critcicism, saying: ‘If the athlete didn’t find it upsetting, why should the BBC mount their politically correct high horse and gallop off into the sanctimonious sunset?’ And viewers expressed their anger at the move. Andrew Ramsbottom wrote on Twitter: ‘Ha, now the BBC has really lost the plot. We now have the G-word that is not PC! Girl is now deemed sexist and can’t be used. Just wrong!’ Garry Sawyer added: ‘The BBC has gone PC mad, deleting the word “girl” from a doco for being sexist, what is this world coming to?’ Stephen Williams highlighted the  corporation’s poor record of featuring women presenters aged over 50. He said: ‘BBC edit out word “girl” as though it might be construed as sexist! Dumping older women broadcasters alright though.’ But TV presenter Mariella Frostrup backed the corporation’s stance, telling the Mail on Sunday: ‘I can imagine why it would be controversial. The athlete may not have been offended but the BBC has to think of the sensibilities of everybody watching.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Mark didn’t mean to cause offence. But the word “girl” was taken out just in case it did.’","BBC cut the 'G-word' from repeat of a Commonwealth Games documentary .

"No matter how brutal their crimes, most Florida death row inmates are given their choice of a last meal and while some ask for typical fare, others  leap at the last chance for indulgence. While the recent execution of Florida murderer William Happ made headlines last week for its controversial use of a new drug, his choice of a box of chocolates and a tub of ice cream wouldn’t strike anyone as ill advised. While decadent choices are the norm, other inmates—including one very notable female killer—opt for more Spartan last meals. Indulgent: Rapist and murder William Happ, Florida's most recently executed inmate, made headlines when the state chose to use a new drug to do the job called midazolam. Also notable was his choice of a box of chocolates and a tub of chocolate ice cream as his last meal . Before Panhandle Killer Arthur Rutherford was put to death in 2006, he requested some foods true to his southern locale, reports the Orlando Sentinel. A deep fried feast of fried catfish, fried green tomatoes, fried eggplant, and hush puppies were laid out for him before his lethal injection. Rutherford washed it down with sweet tea. Clarence Hill, an attempted bank robber and cop killer, asked for tacos. So did Angel Nieves Diaz, who murdered the owner of a Miami strip club while he and accomplices robbed it. Oba Chandler, who raped and murdered an Ohio woman and her two teen daughters after they asked him for directions in 1989, asked for salami sandwiches and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Simple: When Oba Chandler was about to be put to death for raping and murdering a woman and her teen daughters in 1989, he chose to eat salami sandwiches on white bread and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . Wasted: Killer John Spenkelink's execution was notable for two reasons--one, he was the first person executed after the Supreme Court lifted the ban on capital punishment, and two, he was drunk when it happened. Florida has since banned alcohol as part of the last meal . Deep fried: The Panhandle killer Arthur Rutherford stayed true to his deep south locale when he asked for fried catfish, fried green tomatoes, fried eggplant, hush puppies, and sweet tea . John Spenkelink got a special treat at his 1979 execution. Not only was he the first in Florida to be put to death following the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of the death penalty, but he also got to split a flask of Jack Daniels whiskey with the prison superintendent. Aileen Wuornos’ seven-man killing spree was immortalized in the 2003 film Monster, but her life came to an end the year before. She declined a last meal and instead drank just a cup of coffee nine hours before she was put to death. Taking the opposite route was Allen Lee Davis, who murdered a pregnant woman in 1982 along with her two young daughters. He chose to have a smorgasbord of lobster tail, fried potatoes, a half-pound of fried shrimp, six ounces of fried clam strips, half a loaf of garlic bread and 32 ounces of A&W root beer. Restrictions: Florida now limits last meals to $40 each. They must be prepared at the prison and the food must be purchased locally . Crunchy or soft? Though Angel Nieves Diaz killed a man in a strip club, he did not ask for buffet cocktail wieners. Instead, he chose tacos. Clarence Hill, a cop killer and attempted bank robber, also chose the Mexican dish . Allen Lee Davis's execution became infamous when the state's brand new electric chair after retiring 'Old Sparky' caused him to scream and bleed from the nose. His meal of a lobster tail, a half-pound of fried shrimp, six ounces of fried clam strips, garlic bread and 32 ounces of A&W root beer was also conspicuous . Famous: Aileen Wuornos, whose wild murder spree became the Charlize Theron film Monster, declined a last meal and had only a cup of coffee 9 hours prior to her 2002 execution . In addition to the extravagance of his meal, Davis’ execution became well known its goriness after the killer convulsed and screamed as blood gushed from his nose. Davis’ was the first execution that utilized Florida’s new electric chair in 1999, which replaced the rickety oak ‘Oak Sparky’ chair that had been in use since 1924. All inmates in Florida must request their last meal ahead of time and each meal must be prepared in the prison. That means no fast food. Extravagance is now also frowned upon and meals may not cost in excess of $40. No booze has been allowed since John Spenkelink’s indulgence with the superintendent. Inmates must eat their meals, according to the state’s Death Row Fact Sheet, from a tray and, oddly enough, with a spork. Multipurpose: Regardless of what Florida inmates choose for their last meal, they all get sporks to eat it with .","From lobster tails to fried green tomatoes to a simple cup of coffee, the last meal requests of Florida inmates are unpredictable and varied .
Everyone gets a last meal, but it can't cost more than $40, must be prepared in the prison, and must be purchased locally .
To eat their meals, inmates are given a spork ."
"British television coverage of the Russian Grand Prix — the most security-conscious race ever staged — could go blank moments before Vladimir Putin arrives at the Sochi Autodrom on Sunday. The BBC and Sky have been warned that Russian security forces will scramble radio frequencies to block any potential bomb being activated by these means. Radio microphones and cameras would no longer be able to function, possibly putting both networks briefly off air. BBC’s Formula One editor Mark Wilkin confirmed: ‘The worst scenario would be if we are live and got no warning about when they will interfere with the frequencies. Then we could go blank for a moment. But we have a contingency plan. We will have cameras that are not reliant on radio frequencies to take over and could go to tape instead.’ VIDEO Scroll down for Nico Rosberg's preview of the Russian GP . TV pictures could go blank moments before Vladimir Putin arrives at the Sochi Autodrom this weekend . Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone (left) and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin talk in ceremony . Radar guarding against a threat from the skies could also cause white speckles to appear on the screen. In another security measure, TV crews have been warned not to put their cameras too close to Putin as he accompanies his friend Bernie Ecclestone and the King of Bahrain, who is here for talks, around this shiny new circuit on the Black Sea coast. Putin’s lichniki — his guards from the Presidential Security Service, an offshoot of the old Soviet KGB — will be poised to intervene. Let’s hope someone has told the not noticeably shy Eddie Jordan, who will conduct the grid walk for the BBC. Security has been increased because of the war in Ukraine, and assassination fears are now greater than during the Winter Olympics here in February. So on the way into the circuit, there are armed guards and airport-style screening — rare for Formula One if not most other global sports events. There will also be 500 Cossack warriors protecting public order, 180 of them in the giant grandstand opposite the garages. These precautions add a faintly sinister dimension to a grand prix that already has been lent a maudlin air by last week’s accident in Japan that has left Marussia driver Jules Bianchi clinging to life. Lewis Hamilton was fastest in the second session for this weekend's inaugural Russian Grand Prix . Hamilton, 10 points ahead of Nico Rosberg in the championship, topped the timesheets on Friday afternoon . Formula One is making its inaugural foray into Russia. Hamilton set the pace in the second session . Both team-mates at Marussia and Ferrari, where he is on their young driver programme, are sleep-starved through anxiety. Their desperation tells us that Formula One’s younger generation are not hardened to serious injury and death at the track. On Friday, the FIA held a press conference in which Charlie Whiting, the race director, defended the way he conducted the Japanese Grand Prix, in which Bianchi hit a tractor that was recovering another car. Whiting did, however, highlight some areas that would be addressed by a powerful FIA safety commission: a possible speed limit during yellow-flag phases, a re-examination of whether canopies should be fitted to cockpits, a study of helmet strength, and a study into whether skirts should be fitted around tractors. Ideally we should be talking about Lewis Hamilton versus Nico Rosberg in the title fight, but Bianchi’s plight and the political nature of the race make that impossible to do as freely as we would wish. Hamilton, who leads Rosberg by 10 points and led the practice times on Friday, related the trauma of the last few days to his memories of his nine-year-old friend Daniel Spence, saying in his BBC column: ‘Even now, I can remember standing on the bank beside a track with him with our suits on just before a race, all laughing and joking. The next thing I knew I was at his funeral. It was the first time I’d been to one. Formula One driver Jules Bianchi received urgent medical treatment after the crash but remains in hospital . Formula One chiefs are proposing a speed limit to slow down cars during dangerous situations on the track . Race director Charlie Whiting says it would be best to give teams the ability to cut speed automatically . ‘It is very hard to put that out of my mind at the moment, after what happened to Jules. But it does not make me rethink wanting to be a Formula One driver. I love this sport.’ Whiting discussed a number of his ideas with the drivers on Friday and will talk to the teams collectively on Saturday morning. However, no safety improvements will be introduced for this weekend’s race — a vanity project for Putin, who has paid Ecclestone in excess of £100million towards a seven-year contract for the privilege. The staging of the race scratches an old Soviet itch. Leonid Brezhnev, who drove at hell-raising speeds around Moscow’s quiet night-time streets in his fleet of cars that included his beloved Rolls-Royce Shadow, tried to bring Formula One here. His original idea was a track circling the Kremlin. More than 30 years later the race has arrived. But should it be going ahead when, among other considerations, flight MH17 came down at a spot in Ukraine only 320 north west of here? It is a moral dilemma with which Formula One has not over-exercised itself. Then again, the West has not imposed sporting sanctions on Russia, a decision made by the EU rather than BC Ecclestone. Nor have sponsors squealed. Still, many of us will feel extremely uneasy watching President Putin playing politics in the paddock.

"Ukip has taken a commanding 13-point lead in the crunch Rochester by-election, according to a shock poll last night. The ComRes survey suggests former Tory MP Mark Reckless is on course to win next month’s by-election in Kent, just weeks after defecting to Ukip. The survey of 1,500 voters puts Ukip on 43 per cent, well ahead of the Conservatives on 30 per cent. Scroll down for video . Leading: Ukip leader Nigel Farage (left) in Rochester, Kent, with Mark Reckless (right), who defected from the Conservative Party to Ukip last month and will represent them in the forthcoming by-election on November 20 . Labour, which came second in the seat in 2010, is trailing on 21 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats and Greens both languishing on 3 per cent. The poll suggests Ukip is consolidating its grip on the seat, despite a massive push by the Tories. The last opinion poll in the constituency, on October 5, put the Conservatives nine points behind. The development is a serious setback to David Cameron, who has pledged to ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at the attempt to hold the seat, in a bid to halt the Ukip surge. Ominously for the Prime Minister, the latest poll found that 62 per cent of voters view the November 20 by-election as a ‘good opportunity to show David Cameron and the Conservatives how unhappy I am with their Government’. The Prime Minister was rocked earlier this month by the Clacton by-election, where Tory defector Douglas Carswell crushed his former party to become Ukip’s first elected MP. A second defeat by Ukip would be a body blow to Mr Cameron just six months away from the General Election. 'Open primary' election to select Tory candidate: The winner of the contest between local councillors Anna Firth (left) and Kelly Tolhurst (right) is due to be announced today . Ukip leader Nigel Farage is predicting that more MPs will defect to the anti-EU party if Mr Reckless wins, sparking further debilitating by-elections. Some Tories have even warned that defeat could lead to a challenge against Mr Cameron’s leadership. Unlike in Clacton, Tory sources were initially confident that they could win in Rochester, arguing that Mr Reckless is a less popular figure locally than Mr Carswell and that Ukip has less of a presence. At the 2010 election Mr Reckless took Rochester and Strood for the Conservatives with a majority of almost 10,000 over Labour. Ukip did not stand in the seat last time. The latest poll suggests that Ukip is drawing its support from across the political spectrum. Some 39 per cent of people who voted Conservative in 2010 now plan to vote Ukip, as do 39 per cent of Lib Dems and 30 per cent of Labour voters. More than half of people who did not vote in 2010 (57 per cent) say they plan to vote Ukip. The party’s success or failure may hinge on its ability to persuade this group to turn out and vote. Tory sources acknowledge they have ‘carpet-bombed’ the constituency with leaflets since Mr Reckless quit last month. Rochester Bridge: At the 2010 election Mr Reckless took Rochester and Strood for the Conservatives with a majority of almost 10,000 over Labour. Ukip did not stand in the seat last time . This has included a personal letter from Mr Cameron to every home in the constituency inviting voters to take part in an ‘open primary’ election to select the Tory candidate. The winner of the contest between local councillors Kelly Tolhurst and Anna Firth is due to be announced today. Tory MPs have each been ordered to campaign in the constituency at least five times before polling day. But the latest poll suggests many voters are already suffering from overkill. Two-thirds (66 per cent) said the Conservatives were ‘coming across as desperate’ by focusing so many resources on the campaign. There is some solace for Mr Cameron, as the poll suggests he is seen slightly more favourably than Mr Farage. But other key Tory messages appear to be struggling to gain traction. Some 53 per cent of voters believe Mr Reckless has acted in a ‘principled’ way, compared to 37 per cent who do not. Fewer than half of voters (47 per cent) believe Mr Cameron will keep his pledge to hold an In/Out referendum on Europe in 2017 if he wins a second term next year. And just 38 per cent say they are concerned that a vote for Ukip next year might usher Ed Miliband into Downing Street, compared with 54 per cent who are not.","ComRes survey suggests Mark Reckless is on course to win by-election .

"The first prototype of what's been dubbed the 'smelliphone' has been shown off by Japanese firm ChatPerf. In a video on DigInfoTV, ChatPerf demonstrates the Scentee device, which can be attached to smartphones and used to send smells to friends. The company claim it can also be used to create atmospheric scents while playing games or watching films, for example. Scroll down for video . The Scentee device from Japanese firm ChatPerf can be attached to Apple phones and used to send smells to friends with text messages, for example. It can also be used to release atmospheric smells while playing games, such as gunpowder scents when playing shooting games. ChatPerf is hoping to launch the device and various scent tanks by September . Smell-O-Vision was a system created in 1960 by Hans Laube. It was used in cinemas during the film Scent of Mystery. The system was fitted to cinema seats and released 30 smells at different points during the film, triggered by the film's soundtrack. Smells included pipe tobacco. In 2013, a group of researchers from the Tokyo University of Agriculture . and Technology developed a prototype smelling screen. The smelling screen combines a digital display with four small fans, one at each corner of the display. Smells are stored in gel packets and are released at set times. The smells are blown parallel to the screen. By varying the speed and strength of each fan, the different smells are moved to specific areas of the screen. The smelling screen is believed to be the first device to incorporate smells into a television scree . ChatPerf PR Manager Aki Yamaji said: 'Suppose you want to send a message to a friend via a social network, maybe because you know your friend it tired. 'You can use [the Scentee] to send a relaxing scent along with your message. 'You can also use it to add a scent to the notification sound whenever you get a new email.' The company also think the Scentee could be used with games. For example, shooting games could come with a gunpowder scent. Or games like Candy Crush Saga could produce a sugary, sweet smell during gameplay. ChatPerf plan to sell different scents in small plastic tanks. These tanks can be fitted to the underneath of the Scentee, and can be swapped around depending on what smell you want to send. When you press 'Puff' on the smartphone's screen, the Scentee lights up and a puff of scent is released from a scent tank attached to the underside of the device. The prototype only works with Apple phones that use the 30-pin connector. An Android version that will plug into the earphone jack is expected by September . The Scentee is plugged into the phone using the phone's connector. To send a smell the sender clicks the Puff button on the screen. The recipient's Scentee lights up and a 'puff' of scent is released from a hole on the right-hand side of the connected device. The company has already released an SDK that links applications and devices, and is hoping that developers will use this kit to start developing apps that use the technology. The prototype uses a 30-pin dock connector compatible with Apple devices up to the iPhone 4S. It does not have the Lightning connector seen on the iPhone 5 yet, nor is there an Android version available.

Around 30 to 40 wedding guests were involved in the brawl at the wedding of Wendy Carter and her fiance Ryan Barraclough . The bride's white gown was doused in beer and WKD as punches were thrown, and children were forced to hide in the toilets, at the Harold Club in Low Moor, Bradford, West Yorkshire . It is not clear exactly how the fight started, but it is believed a pork pie and a water pistol were involved. But despite chaos, the newlyweds managed to laugh off the incident. Speaking at their home in Bradford Mr Barraclough,  27, joked: 'We had a brilliant day. It was great and you've got to expect a good punch up at a wedding.' His new wife added: 'It's just funny now. We had a great wedding and it didn't spoil it.' Police officers were called after the function crumbled on Saturday evening and made three arrests - one for a public order matter and others for assault.

'There were about 70 guests in total, it was pretty much all family. 'Mostly people had some cuts and bruises but one of the women involved the initial fight had her cheek bitten and her ear bitten.

"Kurtley Beale has been stood down from all forms of rugby indefinitely following the revelation he sent 'highly inappropriate and deeply offensive' text messages and images relating to a Wallabies staff member. At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, ARU CEO Bill Pulver confirmed that the integrity unit is investigating a second, more serious allegation against Beale, and the controversial rugby star will not be considered for selection until the hearing has concluded. 'This matter relates to Kurtley Beale allegedly distributing what we consider to be highly inappropriate and deeply offensive text messages and images to a number of people in June, referencing an ARU staff member,' Pulver told a news conference. Scroll down for video . Kurtley Beale is accused of distributing 'highly inappropriate and deeply offensive' text messages and images to a number of people in June, referencing an ARU staff member . Australian Rugby Union CEO speaking at a press conference on Thursday . 'We became aware of this incident this week and believe an independent tribunal is the appropriate forum for these allegations to be considered.' The new incident was raised for the first time with ARU management on Tuesday, leading to the code of conduct tribunal hearing to be chaired by District Court judge Mark Williams.

He will miss Saturday week's third Bledisloe Test against New Zealand at Suncorp Stadium. The hearing will investigate texts and images which were sent from Beale to other members in the team environment, which were then 'inadvertently sent to the staff member concerned', according to Mr Pulver. Bill Pulver addresses the media to address the new incident and ask questions about the integrity unit investigation, the impending hearing and Kurtley Beale's future . Pulver says, 'a date for the hearing will be set in the coming days and is anticipated to take place early next week.' Kurtley Beale has been stood down from all forms of rugby and will face a code of conduct tribunal hearing early next week into the new, 'more serious' matter . Beale, whose future in the game is now on shaky ground, will not be considered for Test selection before the end the tribunal hearing, set down for next week. Beale was already facing disciplinary charges for being involved in a verbal altercation with Wallabies business manager Di Patston, while travelling from Johannesburg to Sao Paolo the day after the side's 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town.

"Arrested: Richard Moller, 50, was arrested by Boulder police, Colorado, after he allegedly beat a raccoon to death and injured another in a revenge attack for the slaughter of his cat . A 50-year-old man allegedly beat two raccoons - one fatally - with a nail-studded plank of wood because he harboured loathing for the species which killed his cat years ago. Richard Moller, from Boulder, Colorado, claimed in an arrest affidavit he saw an 'opportunity' to kill the raccoons as 'revenge' for the slaughter of his cat. The two raccoons were in a large dumpster  when Moller spotted them, and he allegedly jumped inside, according to the Boulder Daily Camera. He then picked up a piece of nail-studded wood and started beating the animals, the news service said. An eye witness said he could hear the raccoons 'screaming and moaning' as Moller was allegedly 'pushing nails into the animals,' the Daily Camera reported. The witness intervened and yelled at Moller, but his response was: 'All raccoon must die,' the news service said. He then allegedly jumped out and walked away from the scene. Police caught up with Moller and searched the dumpster. Inside they found one dead raccoon and another injured animal, which ran away before they could catch it. They also found a three-foot plank with nails sticking out of it. In a police interview, Moller claimed he had watched raccoons kill his cat years ago, the news service said. According to the police affidavit, officers found one raccoon dead in the dumpster, another injured one ran away. They also found a plank of wood with nails in it . When he saw the two animals in the . dumpster his anger took over and he told police it was his 'opportunity . to kill the raccoons'. He claimed he didn't use the side of the board with nails sticking out to hit the animals. Moller faces two counts of felony animal cruelty, the news service said, adding that on Tuesday he remained at the Boulder jail on $100 bond. He is due to appear in court today.

"Mutiny: Labour leader Ed Miliband hastily rejected the PM's plan for ‘English votes for English laws’ Labour leader Ed Miliband faced a mutiny from his own MPs last night after hastily rejecting David Cameron’s scheme to introduce ‘English votes for English laws’. He sparked a backlash by refusing to support plans to curb the rights of Scottish MPs along with the transfer of new powers north of the border. Instead he called for an unwieldy ‘constitutional convention’ to consider changes in the wake of the historic independence referendum and which would not report back until the end of next year. Labour sources said Mr Miliband was ‘wary’ of any plan to limit the right of Scottish MPs to vote on laws at Westminster that only affect England and Wales. Aides fear it could neuter the ability of a future Labour government to pass laws on issues ranging from health and education to welfare and tax. Mr Miliband said he would not sign up to anything that could be ‘used for narrow party political advantage’. However, senior Labour MPs last night warned it was untenable for the party to oppose the move while arguing for Scotland to be given more powers. Former minister John Denham, a close ally of Mr Miliband, said that while it was right to look at other elements of devolution, it was ‘inevitable’ that there would have to be change at Westminster. ‘As the powers of the Scottish Parliament increase, the role of Scottish MPs in determining English laws will inevitably diminish,’ said the Southampton MP. ‘If the aim is to ensure that laws affecting England alone have the consent of elected English representatives, there are many ways of doing so.’ Former Home Secretary John Reid said the current situation was ‘unfair’, adding that the issue should have been addressed when Labour established the Scottish Parliament in 1999. He said Labour’s attempt to deal with the problem had been abandoned when voters rejected the dream of former deputy prime minister John Prescott to set up a regional assembly in the north east a decade ago. Mr Reid said: ‘That anomaly has been left outstanding since then. ‘My own view is that it is unfair that three of the nations can decide on exclusively their own basis on legislation applying only to them but the biggest nation (England) can’t. So it has to be addressed.’ Scroll down for video . Home rule: The Prime Minister said Scottish MPs should be banned from voting on English-only issues . Former Labour minister Frank Field called for ‘home rule’ in England and said his party also had to ditch the controversial Barnett formula – which means public spending is £1,623 per head higher in Scotland than in England. He said: ‘The promises to Scotland ensure that the English Question will dominate May’s general election. ‘Voters will demand from all English candidates whether they support English home rule and if they support giving an additional £1,600 a year, for ever, for every person living in Scotland, over and above what they will vote for their own constituents. The Scottish grandee appointed to oversee devolution is chairman of an energy firm found guilty of ripping off up to one million customers. Lord Smith of Kelvin joined SSE in 2005 and last year was at the helm when it was hit with a £10.5million fine for mis-selling policies. He has also been forced to defend frequent price hikes and the huge profits made by the company. His considerable personal wealth has allowed him to buy his own island, Inchmarnock, off the west coast of Scotland and he also owns a vineyard in South Africa. The 70-year-old married father-of-two grew up in a rough area of Glasgow but was a bursary student at Allan Glen’s School in the city. A chartered accountant, he has held senior positions with a series of major banks including the Royal Bank of Scotland, and was chosen as chairman of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow held earlier this year. ‘Voters will demand ‘yes’ to the first question, and ‘no’ to the second. These are the answers I shall willingly give.’ Former Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay said: ‘The case for an English Parliament is compelling if not overwhelming. Just tinkering around with a few extra powers, for so-called regional authorities and cities, will simply not do.’ Mr Mackinlay said there were numerous examples of ‘unacceptable’ measures being introduced in England with the support of Scots. These included a doubling of road tolls on the M25 river crossing at Dartford at the same time as charges were scrapped on the Erskine Bridge on the Clyde. The M25 toll increase was pushed through by the then Labour transport secretary Douglas Alexander, a Scottish MP. However, Mr Miliband warned it would be wrong to rush into a new constitutional deal. The Labour leader said there needed to be a series of regional ‘dialogues’ covering every area of the UK on how power could be dispersed from Westminster – including in England. A lengthy public consultation was needed because the matter would not be left to the ‘Westminster elite’, he added. Among the issues Mr Miliband said should be considered are the case for a ‘senate of the nations and regions’. But Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps accused Mr Miliband of trying to fudge the issue for political advantage. Better Together? Ed Miliband, pictured with Alistair Darling and No vote supporters, would not condemn plans to restrict the say of Scottish MPs in English affairs. Instead his party hinted at powers for English regions . He said yesterday: ‘We need a new and fair settlement not just for Scotland, but for every part of the United Kingdom. And we want to work on a cross-party basis to make that happen. ‘But Ed Miliband’s proposal would kick this vital issue into the long grass. The Scottish No vote could mean a 2p-a-litre dip in fuel prices at the pumps, according to the AA. Before the referendum result, uncertainty over the Union’s future led to a drop in the value of sterling. This resulted in a slight rise in the price of petrol and diesel for UK consumers despite a fall in world oil prices, the motoring group said. But with the pound already rising following the No vote, the AA is now confident of better fuel deals. Its president, Edmund King, said: ‘Scotland’s support for staying in the Union boosted the pound ... [it] rose against the dollar to more than 1.65 at one point. ‘We believe that if the pound stabilises at these higher levels we should be seeing at least a 2p per litre reduction in pump prices, which will be great news for everyone north and south of the border.’ ‘If he is serious about delivering on our joint commitment to publish draft legislation on devolving more powers to Scotland by January, he must say whether he supports an equal settlement for England – English votes for English laws.’ Mr Miliband was also facing Labour criticism over the party’s lacklustre campaign north of the border, which failed to catch light until former prime minister Gordon Brown appeared to take charge in the final weeks. More than a third of Labour voters are thought to have backed independence. One shadow minister said: ‘The brutal truth is that Ed Miliband does not connect with our voters in Scotland. Until Gordon intervened we were losing them.’ The Labour leader has made 14 visits to Scotland since March and has spent the final week of the campaign visiting different parts of the country. But his personal ratings in Scotland have remained at around the same level as in England, despite very low levels of support for the Conservatives in most of Scotland. The Labour leader was forced to pull out of two scheduled appearances after he was shouted down during a walkabout in Edinburgh earlier in the week. Following chaotic scenes as he was mobbed during a visit to a shopping centre in the Scottish capital, he claimed the campaign for independence had an ‘ugly side’.","Opposition skewered by PM who hinted at shades of English Parliament .

"X Factor judge Cheryl Cole has been crowned the nation’s most influential beauty icon. The 30-year-old singer – who this week started filming for the new series of X Factor – topped a poll which questioned women on who most influences their beauty buys. Ex-Corrie actress Michelle Keegan took . second place, followed by supermodel Kate Moss. Other names who made the . top ten include the Duchess of Cambridge, Rihanna and Jennifer Aniston – . who Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden recently declared as her . own beauty icon. It is not difficult to see why women are willing to splash out to try and emulate the northern beauty's look . Cheryl often changes her look, shifting from brunette to blonde and back again, but always keeps up her high glamour finish . Iconic Hollywood actress Audrey Hepburn – star of classic films Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Roman Holiday – crept into the list at tenth place, highlighting her timeless influence on women. The survey of 1000 women revealed celebrities’ robust influence on women’s cosmetics purchases. A . whopping 80 per cent of women said they would definitely buy products . their favourite beauty icon had used in an attempt to emulate their . look. Classic beauty looks, seen on Audrey Hepburn (left) and the Duchess of Cambridge (right) are always popular . Michelle Keegan (left) and Kate Moss's (right) high-octane glamour is another look women want to copy . Most women were not concerned by the A-list price tags of their favourite celebrities’ choice of cosmetics. A quarter admitted they would happily spend up to £80 on a single luxury product their beauty idol had bought, and a further 6 per cent declared they would spend up to an eye-watering £200. On average the survey found that women . would spend £312 a year attempting to recreate Cole and other glamorous . stars’ looks with make-up and skincare products. Half of women attempt to copy celebrities' makeup, such as the looks of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (left) and Rhianna (right) before a big night out of first date, often following specific online tutorials . The survey also exhibited the omnipresent influence of social media, with three quarters of women saying they would rush out to buy a beauty product their icon had posted about on Twitter or Instagram, or mentioned in an interview. Furthermore, a determined 61 per cent of women would attempt to source the particular product online if it was out of stock in store. 1. Cheryl Cole . 2. Michelle Keegan . 3. Kate Moss . 4.

Popular YouTube beauty vloggers such as Lisa Eldridge and Tanya Burr have also profited from women’s desire to emulate the likes of Cheryl Cole. Half of women (49 per cent) confessed they would try to replicate their celebrity idol’s make-up looks for a date or a night out by following YouTube ‘get the look’ tutorials like Eldridge’s, whose ‘Get The Cheryl Cole Look’ video has accumulated over 700,000 views. Only 20 per cent of women claimed they would not purchase beauty products upon a celebrity’s recommendation. Beauty Editor of Escentual.com, who conducted the survey, Emma Leslie said: ‘Women have forever been eager to discover the secrets of their beauty icons, so when a popular celebrity recommends a product via social media or in an interview we always see a frenzy in demand on the website.' ‘It’s not surprising that Cheryl Cole was voted the nation’s top beauty icon,' she added. 'As well as always looking flawless, she’s never afraid to experiment when it comes to make-up and pulls off a wide variety of looks with aplomb.' The majority of women deemed ex-glamour model Jodie Marsh to be the celebrity with the worst beauty look, followed by unlucky-in-love Katie Price.","Michelle Keegan, Duchess of Cambridge and Audrey Hepburn in top ten .

"The ancestors of Native Americans may have set up home in a region between Siberia and Alaska which contained woody plants that they could use to make fires, according to a new study . The people we know as Native Americans actually arrived at the continent in three separate great migrations in the distant past. Most Native Americans are descended from a small group of migrants that crossed a 'land bridge' between Asia and Ameria during the ice ages 15,000 years ago. These migrants, known as the 'First Americans', populated most of North and South America. But there were two subsequent migrations across the same bridge - and DNA from the second and third groups can still be found in Native Americans today. The second and third migrations have . left an impact only in Arctic populations that speak Eskimo-Aleut . languages and in the Canadian Chipewyan who speak a Na-Dene language. Eskimos show the most differences, with a mere 50% of their DNA coming from the 'First Americans'. All the groups originally came from Siberia,  Beringia, a land bridge between Asia and America that existed during the ice ages, more than 15,000 years ago. By studying variations in Native American DNA sequences, the international team found that while most of the Native American populations arose from the first migration, two subsequent migrations also made important genetic contributions. The paper is published in the journal Nature today.‘For years it has been contentious whether the settlement of the Americas occurred by means of a single or multiple migrations from Siberia,’ said Professor Andres Ruiz-Linares (UCL Genetics, Evolution and Environment), who coordinated the study. 'But our research settles this debate: Native Americans do not stem from a single migration. Our study also begins to cast light on patterns of human dispersal within the Americas.’ In the most comprehensive survey of genetic diversity in Native Americans so far, the team took data from 52 Native American and 17 Siberian groups, studying more than 300,000 specific DNA sequence variations called Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms to examine patterns of genetic similarities and differences between the population groups. The second and third migrations have left an impact only in Arctic populations that speak Eskimo-Aleut languages and in the Canadian Chipewyan who speak a Na-Dene language . However, even these populations have inherited most of their genome from the First American migration. Eskimo-Aleut speakers derive more than 50% of their DNA from First Americans, and the Chipewyan around 90%. This reflects the fact that these two later streams of Asian migration mixed with the First Americans they encountered after they arrived in North America. A mastodon rib with an embedded spear fragment, proof of some of the earliest inhabitants of America . ‘There are at least three deep lineages in Native American populations,’ said co-author David Reich, Professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. ‘The Asian lineage leading to First Americans is the most anciently diverged, whereas the Asian lineages that contributed some of the DNA to Eskimo–Aleut speakers and the Na-Dene-speaking Chipewyan from Canada are more closely related to present-day East Asian populations.’ The team also found that once in the Americas, people expanded southward along a route that hugged the coast with populations splitting off along the way. After divergence, there was little gene flow among Native American groups, especially in South America. Two striking exceptions to this simple dispersal were also discovered. First, Central American Chibchan-speakers have ancestry from both North and South America, reflecting back-migration from South America and mixture of two widely separated strands of Native ancestry. Second, the Naukan and coastal Chukchi from north-eastern Siberia carry 'First American' DNA. Thus, Eskimo-Aleut speakers migrated back to Asia, bringing Native American genes. The team's analysis was complicated by the influx into the hemisphere of European and African immigrants since 1492 and the 500 years of genetic mixing that followed. To address this, the authors developed methods that allowed them to focus on the sections of peoples' genomes that were of entirely Native American origin. ‘The study of Native American populations is technically very challenging because of the widespread occurrence of European and African mixture in Native American groups,’ said Professor Ruiz-Linares.‘We developed a method to peel back this mixture to learn about the relationships among Native Americans before Europeans and Africans arrived,’ Professor Reich said, ‘allowing us to study the history of many more Native American populations than we could have done otherwise.’","DNA study proves America was populated by THREE groups .

"She was the young cancer sufferer pictured sitting on the knee of Diana, Princess of Wales, at the royal's final official engagement before her tragic death. Hollie Robinson Marsh beat cancer as a child but has now sadly passed away after the leukaemia returned, 17 years after the photo was taken. The girl was just four when she met the Princess at north London's Northwick Park Hospital children's ward in July 1997. Scroll down for video . Hollie Robinson Marsh was four-years-old when she met Diana, Princess of Wales, during the princess's visit to Northwick Park Hospital . Recalling the day, her mother Claire Robinson from Ruislip, London, told MailOnline: ""To Hollie it wasn’t a big thing, but Hollie was always that kind of person. You could introduce her to The Queen and she’d be the same way as she is with everyone. 'She just treated everyone the same. She was very natural with Princess Diana. Hollie was always just a very easygoing child.' The subsequent image of their encounter was published around the world and was eventually used as an official photo accompanying a £5 coin marking Diana's death. Ms Robinson, 46, said: 'She was excited about it and over the years she was always happy to talk to other children and take her coins into school to show the class. It was always something that she looked at.' Hollie recovered from her illness and, inspired to help others by the Princess, went on to study childcare at school. Her last official engagement in Britain was on 21 July, when she visited Northwick Park Hospital, London (children's accident and emergency unit) Two years on, Hollie showed off the souvenir coins of her meeting with Diana, Princess of Wales, which inspired her in later life . Hollie began working for a children's organisation at 16 and was there until she died, aged 21 . By the age of 16 she had a part-time job with  Kids Can Achieve, a Harrow-based organisation offering support to youngsters with special needs and their families. And she was still working there when, on her 21st birthday, she had the shocking news that her cancer had returned. Ms Robinson said: 'Doctors told us it was a one-in-a-million chance.' She went on: ""Hollie never said “why me, I’ve had it once, why have I got to have it again?” 'She always said to the doctors ""it’s new for me because I don’t remember having it last time, but my mum’s going through it twice."" 'Hollie didn’t want anyone’s sympathy. She just wanted her life back.' Diana, Princess of Wales, also met a youngster called Camila Fiocco during her visit  to Northwick Park Hospital . Despite the fact that her 18-year-old brother Jake was ready to be a bone marrow donor so his sister could undergo a transplant, Hollie became seriously ill from the chemotherapy and radiotherapy she received, eventually leading to multi-organ failure. And when details of her funeral were put on Facebook, hundreds of friends got in touch with family. In the end, around 400 people came to the service, many lining the road to Breakspear Crematorium. Her mother said: ""Looking back on it now I can see she was put here for a reason. There was a reason why we had her for those extra 17 years. She was made to look after those children. 'It’s inspiring in the fact that she met Princess Diana who loved children and Hollie went on to work with children with special needs. She was a remarkable person in that respect.' Simon Jarrett, the chair of Kids Can Achieve, said her passing is a huge loss to both the staff she worked with and the children they care for. He told MailOnline: 'We are terribly shocked and saddened by her death. 'She'd worked with us from the early days of our organisation. She is somebody who had gone through great trials herself and the gave up a career to work with children with very high levels of need. 'She was a great worker and friend and we'll all miss her greatly. It's a really shocking loss we've suffered.' During her visit to the hospital, her last official engagement, Princess Diana, also met a girl called Camila. The four-year-old, who lost her hair during chemotherapy, was one of the patients who saw the Princess unveil a foundation stone for the children's casualty centre. The Princess spotted the child in a bright floral dress and cuddled her as she spoke to her Brazilian-born mother, Anna Fiocco. Leukaemia is the most common form of blood cancer in children. Leukaemia is a blood cancer that affects the white blood cells, a really important part of our immune system that fights infection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALA) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are forms of cancer which affect blood-producing cells in the bone marrow. When a child has leukaemia, control of blood cell production breaks down. The bone marrow - the soft tissue in the middle of our bones where all our blood cells are made - makes lots of abnormal white blood, or leukaemia cells. These never mature into proper white blood cells, vital to a healthy immune system, and so children with leukaemia are at more risk of infection. Now nine in ten children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) - a remarkable turnaround for a previously untreatable disease. The cure rates for children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are now around 65 per cent.

"A pilot had an amazing escape when his plane landed nose-down in a hedge,  leaving him hanging upside down inside. But Alan Bray walked away with only a grazed thumb despite being left trapped in the cockpit for 40 minutes, held in by his harness, as witnesses raised the alarm. In true ‘Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines’ spirit, the 59-year-old said afterwards: ‘I’m a bit sore. The pain is simply from the straps. You don’t get scared at the time, you just do what you trained to do. ‘You spend all that time doing practice forced landings, it is just instinctive.’ Alan Bray had a miraculous escape from a plane crash in Warwickshire, emerging from the aircraft embedded upside down in a hedgerow with only a graze on his thumb . The pilot was left trapped in the small two-seater plane, hanging by his harness in the cockpit for forty minutes while shocked residents called the emergency services . More worrying than the crash itself . was being trapped in the plane, he said. ‘I didn’t want to let go. If I . moved I didn’t know what would happen to the thing.’ Mr Bray, who has ten years’ flying . experience, tried to make an emergency landing in the two-seater plane . when its engine had problems shortly after take-off from Wellesbourne . Airfield in Warwickshire. But as he tried to glide it into a . field the engine cut out. After briefly touching down, the light . aircraft smashed through a fence and on to a private road, before . flipping over on its nose and into the hedge. He was forced to attempt a crash landing in a field at Pastures Farm, near the village of Loxley, after what is believed to be an engine failure . Apart from a 'bloody thumb', Mr Bray, who has been flying for ten years, suffered no serious injuries in the crash, and even came back later that day to wrestle his aircraft out of the hedge . Mr Bray even returned to the scene later the same day to help wrestle the aircraft from the hedge . All that stopped the plane from turning over entirely was a power line that its tail got caught on. Paul Van Der Heyden, who lives close . to Loxley village, near Stratford-upon-Avon, called the emergency . services after hearing the crash on Tuesday morning and spotting the . plane in its unusual resting place. Another resident, Tori Danle, stayed with Mr Bray, of Rugby, while they waited for firemen to free him. The Midlands Air Ambulance also came, touching down in the same field Mr Bray had tried to land in. After he was freed, he was given the . all-clear by paramedics. But the plane, which he part-owns with five . friends, will probably have to be written off. The only thing that saved him from flipping over entirely was an electric line that the plane's tail got caught on .","Alan Bray, 59, was left hanging by harness in cockpit for 40 minutes .

"A woman who went to her GP for a suspected kidney infection ended up giving birth in the treatment room - and says she had no idea she was pregnant. Clare Evans, 24, from Newport, South Wales,  visited an out-of-hours surgery complaining of pains in her abdomen. Doctors had advised her over the phone that she might have a kidney infection, but when she arrived at the surgery her waters broke. Scroll down for video . Clare Evans, 24, had no idea she was pregnant and went to her doctors complaining of abdominal pain .

That afternoon she gave birth to baby Erin Louise Roberts, weighing 6lbs 12oz, in the treatment room at the surgery. Ms Evans said: 'They told me on the phone that they suspected I had a kidney infection, so advised me to come in later that day. 'When I got to the surgery I was in quite a lot of pain and because they thought it was an infection, asked me to give a urine sample. 'But when I went to the toilet my waters broke.' 'I love motherhood, even though it was completely unexpected I wouldn't change it for the world' she says of the shock pregnancy . Ms Evans was rushed into the treatment room at the surgery/ . After being examined by a doctor she was told staff could see a head and that she was nine centimetres dilated. She said: 'I was so shocked - I told them I didn't know I was pregnant. 'My life changed then and there in a matter of seconds. 'I had no signs of pregnancy, I didn't have any morning sickness and I didn't have a bump. 'The first sign was the pain I experienced that morning.' Although the on-call midwife and an ambulance were called, Ms Evans' contractions were so close together she was unable to go in the ambulance.

"A nine-day-old baby died after he was poisoned by the hospital feed drip that was supposed to help save his life . Yousef Al-Kharboush contracted a deadly bacterial infection from contaminated intravenous fluid on the neonatal intensive care unit at St Thomas’ Hospital in London. The number of vulnerable babies made ill by the rogue batch of drips has risen to 18, with babies at nine hospitals throughout the country affected. The surviving babies are understood to be responding to treatment with antibiotics. New tragedy: A second baby fed on a contaminated drip died today, ten days after nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush died in the premature unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London . It emerged yesterday that the . contaminated products supplied by London-based pharmaceutical firm ITH . Pharma had been sent to a total of 22 hospitals. Public . health officials are conducting a major investigation into the . devastating outbreak. ITH Pharma said there was ‘no reason’ for patients . or their families to be concerned because the ‘limited number’ of . batches that could have been affected had been recalled. Southwark . coroner Andrew Harris is treating Yousef’s death on Sunday as . ‘unnatural’. He will today hold a special pre-inquest hearing with the . baby’s parents, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust and ITH Pharma to decide . whether a post-mortem examination is needed and what further steps he . should take. One new case . was confirmed yesterday at Peterborough City Hospital in Cambridgeshire . and two possible cases found at Southend University Hospital and . Basildon University Hospital, both in Essex. The . source of contamination appears to have been traced to a ‘sourced . single raw material ingredient’ from an outside supplier, according to . ITH Pharma. ITH Pharma CEO Karen Hamling and her husband Adam Bloom made a brief statement yesterday at their Park Royal production plant . The Medicines . and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has launched an . investigation and sent its inspectors into ITH Pharma’s plant in Park . Royal, north-west London. A spokesman for the safety watchdog said a . possible sanction would be a temporary suspension of the manufacturers’ licence if the problem had not been remedied. A decision is expected in . the next few days. ITH . Pharma managing director Karen Hamling, 48, who runs the company with . her husband Adam Bloom, 41, said yesterday: ‘As a mother, as a . pharmacist, as someone who has worked for 30 years in healthcare, inside . and outside the NHS, I am deeply saddened that one baby has died and . others have fallen ill from septicaemia. Upsetting: 11 hospitals in England were affected. The Rosie Hospital based at Addebrooke's in Cambridge now has three cases, a rise from the two investigators had previously linked to the contaminated drips . Officials confirmed a baby at Peterborough City Hospital has tested positive test for Bacillus cereus . A baby at Basildon Hospital in Essex has a suspected case of the bug which has not been confirmed . ‘As the managing director of . ITH Pharma, I want to reassure you today that we are doing everything . possible to help the regulators, the MHRA, to establish exactly what has . happened in this case. ‘We . have instituted a recall of the limited number of batches which could . potentially have been affected, and all stock has been removed from . circulation. The suspected contaminated batch of fluid had been sent to 22 hospitals, both private and NHS, across England, according to an alert on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) website. It was sent to 10 hospitals across London including: Chelsea and Westminster, Hillingdon, The Harley Street Clinic, Homerton, King's College, The Portland, Royal Brompton, St Thomas's, St George's and the Whittington. The suspected contaminated batch was also sent to four hospitals in East Anglia including: Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, Basildon Hospital, Peterborough Hospital and Southend Hospital. Two affected hospitals in the West Midlands are Birmingham Heartlands and Russell's Hall Hospital in Dudley. The suspect batch was also sent to Lister Hospital in Stevenage and Luton and Dunstable Hospital. Royal Sussex County Hospital and St Peter's in Chertsey were also sent the potentially faulty batch. It was also sent to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. ‘Given this action, there is no reason for patients, their families or healthcare professionals to be concerned.’ But . a lawyer specialising in medical products yesterday called for all . liquid feed products made by ITH Pharma to be taken out of circulation . until the reasons for the outbreak had been established. Michelle . Victor, a partner in the product liability team at Leigh Day, said: . ‘While the investigation takes place these products should be withdrawn . as the risks are too great.’ Chris Thorne, an expert on clinical . negligence at Clarke Willmott solicitors, said the families involved may . have grounds for a civil action. He said: ‘The simplistic approach . would be to pursue the organisation which supplied the food if it is . formally identified as the source of the bacterium which caused the . illness.’ Health Secretary . Jeremy Hunt, said yesterday there was ‘a lot further to go’ in ensuring . patient safety. ‘The tragic blood poisoning of 18 children shows we can . never take safety for granted. It also shows the importance of prompt . and early identification of problems,’ he added. In total, 160 units of the suspected contaminated batch of feed were sent to 22 hospitals. It . was sent to ten hospitals across London – Chelsea and Westminster, . Hillingdon, the Harley Street Clinic, Homerton, King’s College, the . Portland, Royal Brompton, St Thomas’, St George’s and the Whittington – . and four in East Anglia: Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge, Basildon, . Peterborough and Southend. Two affected hospitals in the West Midlands . are Birmingham Heartlands and Russells Hall in Dudley, and the suspect . batch was also sent to Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Luton and Dunstable . Hospital, Chertsey’s Royal Sussex County and St Peter’s hospitals, . Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and Alder Hey Children’s . Hospital in Liverpool. The Whittington Hospital, London, (left) is one . of the six hospitals affected by the infection. A spokesperson for the . trust in charge of Brighton General Hospital (right) said all three of . the babies infected in its care were responding well to treatment . The trust in charge of the Chelsea and . Westminster hospital (left) has reported four cases while Addenbrooke's . hospital in Cambridge (right) said the two babies infected in its . neonatal unit have responded well to treatment . Two children were given fluid from the contaminated batch at St George’s Hospital, London, and 16 at Alder Hey, without ill effects. None were newborns. Bacillus cereus is a bacterium found in dust, soil and vegetation. It produces very hardy spores which in the right conditions can grow and create a toxin which causes illness, and it is likely to be on most surfaces. Stephen Forsythe, professor of microbiology at Nottingham Trent University, said: ‘The babies would have virtually no immune system to protect them. 'This seems like a totally exceptional and unusual incident. However, unfortunately it has already had a tragic ending.’ ITH Pharma has brought great rewards for Adam Bloom and Karen Hamling. The married couple live in a grand £1.4 million house in a leafy suburb, having seen their pharmaceutical company’s sales grow to more than £15 million in just five years. Their Georgian-style home in Elstree, Hertfordshire, which they bought for just over £1 million in 2007, is set well back from the street. Electric gates open on to beautifully-manicured grounds, with a wide pebble drive leading to the large whitewashed four-bedroom, three-bathroom property. ITH Pharma's Karen Hamling, pictured with director Adam Bloom, said she was 'deeply saddened' by the death . Mr Bloom, 41, went to Leeds Grammar School before studying pharmacy at Liverpool John Moores University. Miss Hamling, 48, started out as a pharmacy assistant before completing a pharmacy degree at Brighton University. She was named Entrepreneur of the Year at an awards ceremony for London business leaders in 2013. The couple set up ITH Pharma Ltd in 2008 with the proceeds from the sale of an earlier business. The company specialises in producing sterile made-to-order medical products such as intravenous feed drips and chemotherapy drugs. The firm made a post-tax profit of £547,111 on a turnover of £15.1 million in the year to March 2013, Companies House records show. It has 103 employees. The couple have evidently accumulated considerable wealth of their own as well. The accounts show they made an interest-free loan of £2.9 million to the company. Miss Hamling spoke candidly of the dangers of not following the rules when manufacturing healthcare products in a careers advice video filmed four years ago. She said: ‘If you step off procedure, there is sometimes no one looking over your shoulder. ‘It’s relying completely on trust, that you are going to put your hand up and say, “I have come off procedure”, and we need to actually discard that product rather than allowing it to go into circulation.’ One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said yesterday: ‘They’re just delightful people. We are completely shocked by the tragedy.’","Nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush named as baby who died in London .

"Pop diva Cher caused controversy yesterday when she told her almost two million Twitter followers that she does not celebrate Thanksgiving. Cher, 67, told a fan that she believes Thanksgiving is a holiday that glorifies 'a great crime.' She went on to say the day celebrates stealing land from Native Americans who had no concept of property or land ownership and purposely  giving them smallpox. Thanks for nothing: Cher does not celebrate Thanksgiving because she believes it glorifies crimes against Native American people . Family time: Cher says she and her family get together for a meal and watch movies on Thanksgiving . The revelation began with an expression of gratitude when Cher tweeted, '2 My Crew… I Hope Tomm.is a Glorious day 4 ALL OF U Remember.. A Kind Word, Gesture, Or Compliment can make ANY1′s DAY! THANX4BeingThere4Me.' A Twitter follower then tweeted, '@Cher you don’t celebrate the holiday I thought? Or was that something I was just told?' She responded, emphatically, that she doesn't. 'I DON’T !' tweeted Cher, explaining that it's a day when she can share a meal with her family and watch a movie. 'Not 2 celebrate the beginning of a GREAT Crime,' she tweeted. Daring: Cher has never been a shrinking violet and has long been known for being outspoken about her political views . Another Twitter follower asked her to elaborate on what 'crime' she was referring to, and Cher explained her comment.'Stealing Land, from a ppl, Who believed, Owning Land Was LIke Owning SKY!' Cher, who has Cherokee ancestry, is known for her left-wing views and once said George W. Bush's eight years in office 'almost killed' her. In September 2013, the pop chameleon declined an invitation to perform at the 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Russia due to the country's controversial anti-gay legislation.","Cher tweeted that Thanksgiving celebrates the 'beginning of a great crime'

"When Tubs the Labrador refused to take milk or formula from a bottle, it seemed the puppy was unlikely to survive. The animal was the runt of a litter left as orphans when their mother died, and taken in by a Colarado woman. But when he was just an hour from death, the woman saved the puppy's life – by breastfeeding it herself. Feeding time: A Colarado woman  saved the life of Tubs the Labrador after he refused to take milk or formula from a bottle - by breastfeeding the puppy herself. Above, Tubs latches on to the breast of the woman . 'You could call it a maternal instinct': The woman - who wishes to remain unnamed - said the animal had been the smallest of the litter of mixed-breed Labradors that she had fostered following the death of their mother . 'He wasn't moving and I just did it. I didn't know what else to do. I was desperate and I just couldn't bear sitting there watching him die,' the mother-of-one told KRDO-TV. 'I guess you could call it, in a sense, like a maternal instinct.' The unnamed woman - who has a 15-month-old child  - said the puppy had been the smallest of the litter of mixed-breed Labradors that she had fostered following the death of their mother. She confessed she had felt 'weird' about breastfeeding the animal - but that the notion had just 'clicked' in her head. Warning: Veterinarian Amber Williams has warned of the risks posed by breastfeeding animals like puppies . 'I thought ""just put him on you and pray to God that he'll take something and not die"",' said the woman, who later posted a photo of herself breastfeeding the puppy on Facebook. And her actions appear to have saved the puppy's life - with the animal now weaned off breast milk and taking formula. It is also no longer the runt of the litter, and has even grown larger than some of its siblings - earning it the nickname 'Tubs'. 'I've seen the results. That dog is alive because I took the initiative,' she said. However, veterinarian Amber Williams has warned of the risks posed by breastfeeding puppies - in particular, the danger of zoonotic diseases (conditions transferred between animals and humans). 'There are things that can be passed from puppies to babies,' she said. 'In . an emergency situation, I don't think it's a big deal, but . for them to grow appropriately, I think it would be important for them . to get on a canine formula.' She added that human breast milk is not the most nutritional food for puppies - potentially damaging their growth and general health.","Tubs the Labrador was runt of litter left as orphans after mother died .

"When Real Sociedad scored against Barcelona after just one minute on Sunday night, television cameras honed in on the Barcelona bench, where coach Luis Enrique had left almost £200million worth of his squad. Neymar turned to Lionel Messi and said: 'You had better get warmed-up'. The star player's joke at the expense of his manager was symptomatic of the chaos that currently reigns at Barcelona. Enrique is set to hold talks with president Josep Maria Bartameu on Wednesday. Lionel Messi started Barcelona's defeat at Real Sociedad on the bench and has fallen out with Luis Enrique . Messi shakes hand with opposing manager David Moyes after the final whistle in San Sebastian . Total crisis! The back page of Spanish publication Sport on Tuesday - while it says Messi is 'p***** off' Enrique is under pressure after leaving almost £200m worth of talent on the bench against Real Sociedad . Luis Enrique is a club legend at Barcelona and a highly respected young coach, but after falling out with Lionel Messi there is usually only one direction for a manager at the Nou Camp.

The manager will speak to the press at 1pm, with his boss holding a press conference separately in the Richard Maxenchs press room of the Nou Camp at 4pm. Barcelona began 2015 in turmoil after the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld FIFA's ban on them signing players for the next 12 months and are now in full-blown meltdown with Messi one of several senior players at loggerheads with Luis Enrique, who could be replaced as early as Wednesday despite the board's original intention to give him two games to save himself. The players' biggest complaint towards the manager, who is yet to name an unchanged team this season, is that they don't know where they stand with him. Messi, Neymar and Dani Alves were all given two extra days' holiday over Christmas only to then be told when they returned that they had not trained enough to play the first game of the year. Messi's desire to play in every match – something that Pep Guardiola nearly always made sure he did – means he took the decision badly and failed to show for training on Monday complaining of gastroenteritis. Sick to the stomach of his manager would be another interpretation; the two men are believed to have argued both during Friday's training session and on Sunday in San Sebastian. Monday's session was open to the public with school children still on their Christmas holidays allowed to watch their heroes train, but Messi was at home following Chelsea on Instagram instead. He also follows Beyonce and Manchester City so it would be taking it too far to see such a move on social media as a 'come and get me' message but the timing was telling all the same. AS splash on their back page with 'Messi drives Barca to despair' while Marca opt with 'Barca fall apart' Messi is Barcelona's record goalscorer but has been linked with a summer switch to Chelsea . Messi fuelled speculation he could be keen on a move to Chelsea by following the club's Instagram account . January 8: Elche (h) - Copa del Rey . January 11: Atletico Madrid (h) - La Liga . January 15: Elche (a) - Copa del Rey . January 18: Deportivo (a) - La Liga . January 24: Elche (a) - La Liga . Chelsea fans hopeful he could end up at their club – he also followed Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis on Instagram – should probably bear in mind that when Messi is unhappy at Barcelona it tends to be the people he is unhappy with that move on. Enrique should be given this week's cup game with Elche and Sunday's showdown with Fernando Torres' Atletico Madrid to save his job but Messi is by no means alone in being unhappy at the head coach. Gerard Pique, new signing Ivan Rakitic and Neymar are others and, far from just being personal gripes, there are overriding concerns over the way the coach has the team playing. The manager who took over in the summer has a reputation for falling out with star players. He upset both Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi at Roma and, with Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta already fired and assistant Carles Puyol having quit soon after, the spotlight now falls on him. Enrique has two games to save his job, the second of which against Fernando Torres'  Atletico Madrid .

President Josep Bartomeu is also under pressure, not just to change the coach but to call elections. Prospective rival candidate for the presidency Agusti Benedito said on Monday night on Spanish radio: 'It's clear that this board has weighed up the possibility of selling Messi.' Benedito, who received the second-most votes in the last election, was alluding to the theory that the current regime have deliberately antagonised the star in recent seasons, knowing how much selling the player would swell the coffers, but also being aware his departure would have to appear to be engineered by him and not them. Former Barcelona striker Hristo Stoichkov also waded in to criticise those in power at the club. He said: 'Bartomeu understands basketball but not very much about football. He is not a President, he's an administrator who has landed the job because the person in charge (Sandro Rosell) was a bottler who ran away.' The outspoken former Barça dream team member also criticised the outgoing Zubizarreta saying: 'What signings have been made? Why did they not go for (Toni) Kroos and Isco?' Suarez has only scored one La Liga goal but Hristo Stoichkov has defended the former Liverpool striker . Many have criticised Barca for not attempting to sign Isco (L) and Toni Kroos (R), who are now at Real Madrid . Barcelona are only a point behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid but severe problems lie off the field . The pressure is on Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu (left, posing with Neymar as he signs in 2013) Barcelona will not be allowed to sign players in 2015 after the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the FIFA sanction imposed on the Catalan club. The ban was imposed on Barca after they were deemed to have breached rules on signing international players under the age of 18. Barca were appealing the ban at CAS headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, in December but it was confirmed that it has been upheld and the Catalans will also be fined 450,000 Swiss Francs (£293,000). He also defended Luis Suarez saying: 'It's not Suarez's fault, he is a natural goalscorer and they are killing him.' The big summer signing from Liverpool has suffered in Enrique's ever-changing line-ups and has so far scored only one league goal. Barcelona president Bartomeu will publicly address supporters' concerns on Wednesday and announce a new Sporting Director with Fiorentina's Eduardo Macia an in-house option and Jordi Roura the leading candidates. Macia is a former Liverpool scout, who has also worked at Valencia and Olympiacos while Roura took over first team affairs when the late Tito Vilanova fell ill. For the next 12 months whoever steps in will have very little to do in view of Barca's transfer ban. Some of Zubizarreta's harshest critics have already questioned the timing of his dismissal. 'For a club that can't sign players, he is the perfect Sporting Director,' said one, recalling the disastrous summer recruitments of Brazilian full-back Douglas and former Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen who have started one league game between them. Thomas Vermaelen was brought in from Arsenal in the summer but has yet to play a game due to injuries .","Barcelona were beaten 1-0 by David Moyes' Real Sociedad on Sunday night .

"Two women accused of pummeling and kicking a 23-year-old woman who died after a fight outside a California nightclub have been convicted of felony manslaughter but acquitted on far more serious second-degree murder charges. Candace Brito, 27, and Vanesa Zavala, 26, had pleaded not guilty in the death of Annie Hung Kim Pham, who was taken off life support after the fight outside the Santa Ana bar-restaurant in the early morning hours of Jan. 18. Several jurors cried openly as the verdicts were read on Thursday afternoon. The case had drawn enormous attention after Pham’s death, in part because the brawl that was captured by several bystanders on cellphone video that will provide key evidence in the case. Scroll down for video . Vanesa Zavala, left, and Candace Brito, right, have been convicted of felony manslaughter but acquitted on far more serious second-degree murder charges in the death of Annie Hung Kim Pham . Superior Court jurors chose to convict the women of the lesser charge instead of second-degree murder, which carried a potential life sentence. Each now faces a sentence of up to 11 years in state prison. ‘I told (Brito), “You don't know this yet, but you won. One day when you get out, sooner rather than later, you'll realize you could have spent the rest of your life in jail,’” her attorney, Michael Molfetta, said after the hearing. Molfetta said his client and Zavala never intended to kill anyone and should never have faced murder charges. A forensic pathologist who conducted Pham's autopsy ruled the cause of death was blunt force injury to the head but said it was impossible to tell whether one specific blow or even a combination of blows caused the fatal brain bleeding. Pham, who went by the first name Kim, graduated from Chapman University last year and would have celebrated her first wedding anniversary last month . James Pham, father of Annie Kim Pham, speaks to the media after Candace Brito and Vanesa Zavala were convicted of voluntary manslaughter and assault in the death of his daughter . During the trial, Etoi Davenport testified that Pham could have died as a result of being punched or kicked, or from hitting her head on the sidewalk. The pathologist said Pham received six major blows to the head. Pham's stepbrother, Ken Nguyen, said the family was satisfied with the verdicts. ‘We feel for their families, too,’ Nguyen said of Brito and Zavala. At a preliminary hearing, witnesses testified that Pham and her group of 11 friends were waiting in line to get into the club as Brito, Zavala and several of their friends were exiting. At some point, the groups bumped into each other. One witness told authorities that Pham started swearing and threw the first punch. Pham's friends told police the three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation. Candace Brito, left, and Vanesa Zavala, right, had pleaded not guilty in the death of Kim Pham, who was taken off life support after the fight outside the Santa Ana bar-restaurant in the early morning hours of Jan. 18 . Deputy District Attorney Troy Pino said Pham threw the first punch but the kicks to Pham were ‘cheap shots’ taken while she was not a threat. Jurors were shown cellphone videos of the beating. Molfetta told jurors that Pham started a fistfight with another woman, Emilia Calderon. He said it wasn't proven that his client - a friend of Calderon's - kicked Pham during scuffling involving several people. Zavala's attorney, Kenneth Reed, argued that his client didn't kick Pham and that punches from other people might have killed her. Video footage of the fight was played during Candace Brito and Vanesa Zavala's two week trial which reached a verdict on Thursday . During the two week trial, defense attorneys for the women had claimed it was newly-wed Pham who had thrown the first punch and their clients had acted in self-defense. Brito’s attorney, Michael Molfetta, had told jurors that it was Pham’s own ‘poor decisions’ that had led to her death. ‘She didn’t deserve to die, but the fact is she died because she took umbrage over a bump,’ Molfetta said. Zavala’s attorney had also said his . client had been wrongly charged with murder and that she had a right to . defend herself after being attacked by Pham. Video of a brawl outside a Santa Ana nightclub that left a recent college graduate comatose was played repeatedly during the trial. Pham's friends told police the three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation after they bumped into her . Senior Deputy District Attorney Troy Pino had said the two women deserve to be punished for Pham’s death. At one . point Zavala, who was pushed away from the fight, returned to the scrum . and dealt a final blow to Pham before Pham fell to the pavement . unconscious. ‘Let the criminal system do its job and find justice for the victim,’ Pino said. During a preliminary hearing earlier this year, the forensic pathologist who conducted Pham's autopsy ruled the cause of death was blunt force injury to the head. But she testified that it was impossible to tell whether one specific blow caused the fatal brain bleeding and swelling, or if it came from all the blows in combination. Pham was an aspiring writer whose work was published online and in an anthology of works by Vietnamese-American writers . Just who started the fight was in dispute during the hearing, with various witnesses describing different scenarios. Pham and her group of 11 friends were . waiting in line to get into the club as Brito, Zavala, a woman . identified as ‘Amelia’ and two men were exiting. At some point, the groups bumped into each other. Pham's friends told police the three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation after they bumped into her. Zavala told police that Pham's first swing hit her and the fight began. Pham, who went by the first name Kim, graduated from Chapman University last year and would have celebrated her first wedding anniversary last month.

"Turkey's former military chief has been jailed for life for plotting to overthrow  Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government. Retired General Ilker Basbug was one of scores of defendants that included politicians, journalists and officers accused of being part of the so-called Ergenekon plot. Today's verdicts are the culmination of five years of trials where prosecutors accused defendants of trying to organise high-profile attacks across Turkey and prepare the way for a military coup soon after Erdogan's government came to power in 2002. The landmark case has become central in tensions between Turkey's secular elite and the Prime Minister's Islamic-orientated Justice and Development Party. The trial of scores of people including journalists and military chiefs accused of plotting to overthrow the government has sparked protests in Silivri, Turkey . Retired General Illker Basbug (left) was one of scores of defendants accused of plotting to overthrow Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's (right) government . Hundreds of protesters gathered  near a courthouse in Silivri ahead of the verdicts, which have split the country and increased tensions between the secularists and Islamists . Basbug and 16 other defendants were sentenced to life in prison. They included 10 retired military officers and Dogu Perincek, the leader of the . left-wing and nationalist Workers Party. Sixty other defendants received . sentences ranging from a year to 47 years, according to state-run TRT . television news and at least 21 people were acquitted. The defendants were accused of plotting . high-profile attacks that prosecutors said were aimed at sowing chaos in . Turkey to prepare the way for a military coup. The prosecutions already . have helped Erdogan's government reshape Turkey's military and assert . civilian control in a country that had seen three military coups since . 1960. Today's verdicts sparked protests, and police blocked hundreds of demonstrators from reaching the High Criminal Court in Silivri, 25 miles west of Istanbul, in a show of solidarity with the defendants. However, the trial is not expected  to set off the kind of violent anti-government demonstrations that were recently sparked by a government plan to build a replica Ottoman-era barracks at a park near Istanbul's central Taksim Square. Turkish riot police blocked roads on Monday as the five years of trials of up to 250 people came to an end . Police used tear gas against protesters. Hundreds of people demonstrated against the verdicts today but it is not expected to escalate . Protesters and riot police, who used water cannon, clashed today. Defendants were accused of trying to destabilise the country and planning a coup . The trial, which began in 2008, grew out of an investigation into the seizure of 27 hand grenades at the home of a non-commissioned officer in Istanbul in 2007. The defendants were accused of being part of an alleged ultra-nationalist and pro-secular group called Ergenekon, which takes its name from a legendary valley in Central Asia believed to be the ancestral homeland of Turks. In thousands of pages of indictments, prosecutors maintained that the gang was behind a series of violent acts, including one in 2006 on a courthouse that killed a judge. Prosecutors say the incidents were made to look as though they were carried out by Islamic militants, in a bid to create turmoil and provoke  military intervention. Prosecutors say the gang also plotted to kill Erdogan, Nobel laureate author Orhan Pamuk and other high-profile figures. The defendants rejected the accusations and they are expected to appeal today's verdicts and sentences to the Court of Appeals in Ankara. Prosecutors demanded life prison terms for 64 of the defendants, mostly on terrorism charges. Others were charged with possession of firearms or merely membership in Ergenekon. Secularists in Turkey believe the trials were a sham and tried to march to the courthouse in solidarity . Secular protesters were sprayed with water cannon and tear gas as they tried to march to the courthouse . A protester waves a Turkish flag as he is sprayed with water cannon by riot police . Mehmet Haberal, a surgeon and founder of a university in Ankara, and Mustafa Balbay, the Ankara representative of pro-secular Cumhuriyet newspaper, both faced life prison terms but received sentences of 12 years and 34 years, respectively. The two men were elected to Parliament in 2011 while in prison but were not able to take their seats. Tuncay Ozkan, a prominent journalist who helped organize a series of anti-government protests in 2007, was given a life sentence. The case has polarized the country between those who see it as an opportunity to unravel a shadowy network of ultra-nationalists known as the 'Deep State' that allegedly acted behind the scenes with impunity, and those who believe it is a government attempt to muzzle Erdogan's secular-minded foes and undermine Turkey's secular legacy. In a separate case, more than 300 military officers, including Turkey's former air force and navy chiefs, were convicted last year of other plots to bring down the government in 2003 and some were sentenced to 20 years in prison. Those verdicts are being appealed.","Retired General Ilker Basbug most high profile of scores of defendants in the so-called Ergenekon plot .

"Georgia boss Temuri Ketsbaia vowed to puncture Scottish over-confidence after accusing his Euro 2016 rivals of writing off Saturday evening’s opponents at Ibrox. And the former Dundee midfielder insists that all the pressure will be on the hosts — and not him despite the opening loss at home to Ireland. Ketsbaia said: ‘If they feel confident, that’s their problem, not our problem. You don’t always get what you expect. Sometimes, things don’t go as you would like – especially when somebody is not expecting you to be so tough. Georgia manager Temuri Ketsbaia talks to the press ahead of his side's Euro qualifier against Scotland . ‘The only thing you can do is go out and show them, prove them wrong. That’s what I expect from my players. ‘We’ve been written off from the beginning by Scotland, because they said the only teams who will not play for the finals is going to be Georgia and Gibraltar. ‘OK, that’s their opinion. The only thing we have to do is do our job, do our best and hopefully get the result. The former Dundee midfielder insists that all the pressure will be on Scotland at Ibrox Stadium . ‘Scotland have good players and they have fighters. But they also know they can play very well. ‘They are not Brazilian - but they are good players and that’s why they are playing at a high level. ‘Of course the pressure is on Scotland. They are expected to win, especially when their target is to quality. ‘I am surprised at the confidence of Scotland. They haven’t qualified for 16 years and that’s a long time.’ Scott Brown (centre) trains with Scotland ahead of Saturday's fixture against Georgia . Of his own future, Ketsbaia added: ‘I said after the Ireland game, when we lost, that if we didn’t get the results in the next two games, maybe it would be time for me to go. ‘But I didn’t feel pressure. Nobody has told me that this is my last game. You are always under pressure as a coach. Especially for us because, for five years now, most of the games we’ve played are against teams who are much better than us. But we’re not easy to beat.’","Former Dundee midfielder insists that all the pressure will be on Scotland .

"An Arizona woman who spent more than two decades on death row was released on bond Friday after a judge ruled there's no direct evidence linking her to the death of her young son, other than a purported confession to a detective whose honesty has been questioned. Debra Milke walked out of the Maricopa County Sheriff's jail after supporters posted $250,000 bond. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned her conviction in March, stating that prosecutors should have disclosed information that cast doubt on the credibility of a since-retired detective who said Milke confessed. 'Death Row Debbie': Debra Milke was released from prison on Friday as she awaits a new trial in the 1989 murder of her son, Christopher . Doubt: The 9th Circuit agreed that there is some doubt about damning testimony given by a detective who single-handedly put Milke on death row . The 49-year-old Milke has not been exonerated, but a judge said she could go free while preparing for a new trial in a case that made her one of Arizona's most reviled inmates. Milke was convicted in the death of her 4-year-old son, Christopher, who was allegedly killed for a $5,000 insurance payout. His mother was accused of dressing the boy in his favorite outfit in December 1989 and telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a mall before handing him over to two men who took the child into the desert and shot him. She had been imprisoned since 1990. A defense lawyer told the judge last week that Milke would live in a Phoenix-area home purchased by supporters. As a condition of her bond, Milke is required to wear an electronic monitoring device and be in her home between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Additionally, she is not to have any contact with her ex-husband, Arizona Milke, nor is she allowed to possess any weapons or leave Maricopa County unless she receives prior, written approval from the court. Prosecutors declined to comment on Milke's possible release and have not appealed the bond order. Milke, whose mother was a German who married a U.S. Air Force military policeman in Berlin in the early 1960s, has drawn strong support from citizens of that nation and Switzerland, neither of which has the death penalty. Max Krucker, former president of the Swiss community where Milke's mother now lives, said Renate Janka was ""ecstatic"" Friday about the possibility that her daughter would be released. She was planning to fly to Arizona as early as Saturday, Krucker said. Tragic: Christopher Milke, seen here with his mother Debra, was shot in the head three times. He was just 4 years old . Killers: Jim Styers and Roger Scott admitted to murdering Christopher, and both currently are on death row . 'She said, ''Now I can finally hold my daughter in my arms again,'"" he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from his home. For as long as Milke has been incarcerated, she and her mother have only met in situations where they were separated by glass. 'They were never able to touch,' Krucker said. A dozen years ago, Krucker was among the organizers of an effort in the Swiss town of Emmetten to support Milke, including by establishing a bank account that collected donations to aid in her defense. The account eventually netted about 200,000 Swiss francs, or about $213,000 today. It's now nearly drained, he said. Doubts about Milke's guilt and deep suspicion about the reliability of the detective's testimony helped motivate Swiss supporters to donate, as did opposition to the death penalty. Many also had concerns that Milke didn't have access to the best defense because she had too little money, he said. Now supporters are excited about the prospect of her release, Krucker said, but also worried how she will manage to pay the bond. Janka, who is suffering from cancer, was already forced to sell her home to help cover her daughter's legal bills, he said. Supporters also run a website that requests donations through both German and Swiss accounts. Milke's ex-husband, whose name is Arizona Milke, believes his former wife is guilty and that supporters are fooled by the postings on the website. 'Confession': Detective Armando Saldate claims Milke confessed to her involvement in the murder - but it wasn't recorded and nobody witnessed it - other than Saldate . Crime scene: This cross marks the spot in the Arizona desert where Christopher Milke was ruthlessly murdered . 'It's fed by propagandized lies,' he said Friday. 'They write whatever they want and put it up there like it's true.' Her chance at freedom comes six months after a federal appeals court overturned Milke's conviction, ruling that the prosecution should have disclosed information about the truthfulness of the now-retired detective who testified that Milke confessed. Milke was a 25-year-old insurance company clerk when her son was killed. She has maintained her innocence, saying she had nothing to do with the slaying. The two men convicted in the case both remain on death row. Neither Roger Scott nor former Milke roommate James Styers testified at Milke's trial. Scott confessed during a police interrogation and led detectives to the boy's body. Maricopa County prosecutors are still seeking the death penalty against Milke at her retrial, tentatively set for Sept. 30, and her alleged confession is at the heart of the case against her. Police detective Armando Saldate Jr. testified that she confessed to him in a closed interrogation room. But the confession was not recorded. At trial, Milke denied that she had confessed, but the jury believed the detective. Doubts about Saldate's honesty arose during Milke's appeals. The 9th Circuit concluded in March that prosecutors' failure to turn over evidence related to Saldate's credibility deprived Milke's attorneys of the chance to question his truthfulness before jurors. 'No civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy evidence, quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or overzealousness, to decide whether to take someone's life or liberty,' Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote for the court. The court noted four cases in which judges threw out confessions or indictments because Saldate lied under oath and four instances in which cases were tossed out or confessions excluded because Saldate violated the suspect's constitutional rights. He was also suspended for accepting sexual favors from a female motorist he stopped and then lying about the encounter, the court said. Deputy County Attorney Vince Imbordino argued last week during a bond hearing that the purported confession is still admissible, but Judge Rosa Mroz of Maricopa County Superior Court said the undisclosed material concerning Saldate 'casts serious doubt' on its validity. Mroz, who also set Milke's bond, scheduled a Sept. 23 hearing on the defense's request to prohibit the prosecution from using the confession during the retrial.","The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned her .

"Comedian Russell Brand is considering running as London Mayor – despite saying that voting is a waste of time. The controversial comic has told close friends he wants to succeed Boris Johnson when the Tory Mayor’s second term ends in 2016. Essex-born Brand would stand for the mayoralty on an independent ‘anti-politics’ ticket. Scroll down for video . Russell Brand, pictured with girlfriend Nicola Schuller, says he has no idea about the ‘obtuse’ FTSE stock exchange index and he declares his support for ‘collectives’ and wants to ban fracking and the monarchy . The comic's new book, Revolution, which includes 9/11 conspiracy theories that have enraged New Yorkers . His spokeswoman did not deny the reports last night. Asked if Brand intended to stand, she said: ‘I’ve spoken to Russell and he has no comment to make on this.’ However he has sketched out his bizarre manifesto in his new book, Revolution. In it he says: ‘I can’t get my head around economics’ and adds that he has no idea about the ‘obtuse’ FTSE stock exchange index. He declares his support for ‘collectives,’ and wants to ban fracking and the monarchy. He shows little interest in promoting exports, saying of cars: ‘I wouldn’t worry too much about exporting them as other countries have their own f***ing cars.’ Brand’s ambition comes despite previously saying: ‘Don’t bother voting. We know it’s not going to make any difference.’ The comedian – who is dating make up artist and mother-of-one Nicola Schuller after breaking up from heiress Jemima Khan – has never hidden his loathing of the Conservatives. Last year he wrote that Margaret Thatcher’s death was only sad for ‘a handful of people’, and in his book, he calls David Cameron the most offensive four-letter word. Brand, pictured here on Newsnight this week setting out his stall for political change, has never hidden his loathing of the Conservatives and last year wrote Margaret Thatcher's death was sad for 'a handful of people' Brand’s popularity among the young is reflected by his 8.4 million Twitter followers. But his outrageous comments and antics, such as leaving obscene telephone messages for Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs in a radio stunt with Jonathan Ross, have caused deep outrage. With nominations for the next London mayoral election not likely to close until five weeks before the contest in May 2016, Mr Brand has plenty of time to decide. But any serious campaign would need to begin sooner, not least to raise funds. Mr Johnson raised £1 million for his 2008 campaign. The BBC came under fire last week for giving Brand a platform on Newsnight for his extreme views, while the comedian said the BBC had an ‘anti-Islamic narrative’ and accused host Evan Davis of being ‘mates with CEOs and big business’ and ‘cosying up’ to Boris Johnson. He previously appeared on Newsnight last year, but now admits he was ‘policy bare’ when interviewed by Jeremy Paxman. He is not the only comedian hoping to become London Mayor, as Eddie Izzard has declared his ambition to stand as Labour’s candidate in 2020. Duchess of Cambridge holds Prince George who is the butt of bizzare comments from Russell Brand . Russell Brand has sparked new outrage with a horrific ‘joke’ suggesting that Prince George should be beheaded. In a shocking passage in his new book Revolution, Brand writes: ‘I note that if that baby royal they’ve just done in Blighty were to ascend the throne he’d be George the Seventh. Seventh?! ‘We’ve already had six and we’re gonna have another one. How long do we intend to let this silliness persist? Surely it’s time for us to invest in a Fisher Price guillotine.’ Tory MP Michael Ellis reacted to what he called ‘odious and obnoxious views’ saying: ‘To make a nauseating reference to the execution of a small child will disgust all right-thinking people. Brand should be treated with the contempt he deserves.’ The former drug addict also faced condemnation for urging society to show ‘loving, inclusive, rehabilitative tolerance’ towards paedophiles. Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘He should know better than to speak in this way about people who destroy the lives of children.’ Former Cabinet Minister Lord Tebbit dismissed Brand as ‘no more dangerous than a cowpat’. Told of the vile joke about Prince George, he said: ‘If someone were to make the same suggestion about Left-wing comedians, they would be accused of being very stupid.’ The latest controversy for Brand comes just days after he caused fury by suggesting the US Government may have been behind the 9/11 attacks. Clarence House declined to comment. Neither representatives of Brand nor publishers Random House would comment.","Controversial comic told close friends he wants to succeed Boris Johnson .

"A missing dog whose devastated owners staged the UK's first reconstruction of an animal crime have finally being reunited with their pet after it was found 80 miles away from the family home. The Marsh family of Woking, Surrey, spent £4,000 by shooting a video reconstruction of the moment three-year-old border terrier Toby was snatched and even funded a fly-by banner featuring his name in a desperate attempt to be reunited with the pet. They also launched a huge campaign on social media using the hashtag #FindToby, which was backed by tennis player Andy Murray, comedian Alan Carr and boyband One Direction. Scroll down for video . Lost dog Toby has been reunited with the Marsh family - including baby Pippa - after a huge search for him . Toby back at the family home with owner Louise  Marsh after he was found after going missing for three weeks . The dog was found in a park after Mrs Marsh organised a huge campaign to find him on social media, arranged for a plane to fly a banner in the skies over her town and even staged her own Crimewatch-style reconstruction . However, today Louise Marsh received the call she never thought would come, when a vet's surgery in Kent contacted her to say they had Toby. And straight away Mrs Marsh jumped into her car and drove the 80 miles from her home to go and collect her pet, which had been found running around on a nearby field. Mrs Marsh, 28, said: 'I received a telephone call from a vet in Kent who said they had a border terrier who looked exactly like Toby. 'They said he was fine and had been running around a nearby field playing with a Jack Russell, when a lady noticed him and took him to the vet. 'I drove down there straight away and collected him and we only just brought him home earlier this evening. 'He has been begging for treats ever since.' The family said their three-legged rescue dog, Peggy, had been pining for Toby ever since he went missing . The dog was taken to this vet surgery in Kent after being found playing on a nearby field. The surgery then called Mrs Marsh, who went to pick him up . Mrs Marsh, pictured spent £4,000 in a desperate bid to get her dog back, and even filmed a reconstruction of the moment the dog was snatched . Toby, a pedigree animal, slipped out of the front door when Mrs Marsh was distracted by her six-month-old daughter, Pippa. A local boy found the terrier and, suspecting he was lost, put him on a lead and started knocking on doors looking for the owner. A man sitting in a nearby silver estate car overheard and offered to take Toby to a vet to see if there was an identifying microchip implanted under his skin. Toby, who was wearing a green suede collar, has not been seen since. The man was aged between 40 and 50, with a bald or shaved head. He had a young boy sitting beside him in the car’s front passenger seat . Mrs Marsh, a vet, spent £4,000 in her campaign to find her border terrier, missing for three weeks. A family have filmed a Crimewatch-style reconstruction of the alleged dognapping of their beloved pet. The film shows a youth hand the dog to a driver, who offered to take it to a vet. The dog has not been seen since . A reconstruction of the moment Toby went missing in Woking has taken place in a bid to jog people's memory . There were leaflets — 10,000 of them — and a campaign on social media, and a firm of pet detectives. At the weekend she staged a Crimewatch–style re-enactment of his theft to jog memories, and spent £650 to fly a banner appealing for information about her pet behind an aircraft circling her home town of Woking. But now that Toby is back at home with Mrs Marsh and her husband Les, she says that every penny spent was worth it. She explained: 'One hundred per cent I would do it all again if he were to go missing. 'It has been worth it, especially when I saw his face when I went to pick him up. I would have spent £10,000 if it meant getting him back. The family even paid for a plane to fly over Woking with a banner in a bid to raise awareness of their search . As well as putting up posters, Mrs Marsh made video appeals and took to social media in a bid to find Toby . She added: 'Every time I see him now I just can't believe he is back. I was always hopeful he would come back but as the weeks went on it looked less likely. 'He is definitely getting to sleep upstairs in the bed with us tonight. He isn't normally allowed but my husband said if we got him back he could so I am holding him to that!' This week, campaigners at the Stolen and Missing Pets Alliance called for anyone convicted of stealing a dog to be jailed for at least six weeks, after reports of the crime increased by more than a third over the past two years. In particular, ‘theft by finding’ is said to be on the rise — where people who claim to have innocently come across a dog demand money for its return. From April 2016, all dogs will be required to have an identification microchip inserted under the skin, partly to combat such crimes. But already these chips are being removed by thieves. Despite the huge scale of efforts to find the dog, the animal has not been handed into vets and remains lost .

Regen's Lingerie boutique in Rye Lane, Peckham, south London, which spread through neighbouring Greggs bakery and a post . office in the same street, during riots that spread across the capital . last year. The damage cost more than £1 million and left six people homeless. Cross-eyed giveaway: Officers combed through hours of CCTV footage and spotted Andrew Burls, of Peckham, because of his distinctive crossed eyes . Despite covering his face with a bandana, officers . combed through hours of CCTV footage and spotted Burls, of Peckham, . because of his distinctive crossed eyes. The 23-year-old originally denied the . offence, but was jailed for a total of eight years at Inner London Crown . Court today after pleading guilty on January 30 to two counts of arson . being reckless as to whether life was endangered, and one of burglary . with intent to steal at Iceland in Rye Lane, a court official confirmed. Burls blinked as he heard his fate and glanced up at the packed public gallery before running down the stairs to the cells. Ablaze: Regen's Lingerie boutique in Rye Lane, Peckham, in flames after Andrew Burls set it alight. The fire spread to the next door bakery and a post office in the same street, causing £1million worth of damage . Caught: A CCTV image of a masked Andrew Burls during the riots, but police tracked him down because of his distinctive eyes . Tom Forster, prosecuting, told Judge . Roger Chapple at Inner London Crown Court: ‘What's important about that . image is that his eyes appear distinctive in that they appear to look in . different directions. ‘If My Lord was to compare that with a . photograph of Mr Burls himself when he was arrested, My Lord can see the . distinctive eyes, and the direction in which they point in the . photograph.’ Judge Chapple told the defendant, who . was wearing two plastic crucifixes over a grey sweatshirt: ‘When you . add fire to an already appalling situation you add a while new and . altogether terrifying dimension. ‘The effects of fire can so easily be as they are here, devastating. ‘It is not an accident that the maximum sentence for simple arson is life-imprisonment. ‘Extensive damage was caused to the Post Office, Regen’s and Greggs next door. ‘You plainly didn’t care about the effect of your actions whatsoever. ‘You caused terror to those who had to leave their homes because of the fires you started. ‘Those people felt trapped on that back terrace, watching their homes going up in smoke or flames.’ Anarchy: Peckham looters smash windows and take clothing . Burls’ rampage began at Iceland at . around 6.30pm, moving on to the Post Office and Regen’s, and he was seen . with surging looters in Maestro Records. In footage from Iceland Burls can be . seen approaching the shop and pulling the pane of glass from the window . before going in followed by a surge of looters. The supervisor and staff were in the . shop and locked themselves in a back office, where they watched on CCTV . the masked mob throwing bricks at the building. The manager estimated losses of £1,400. The throng of looters flowed down Rye . Lane, and Burls stopped outside Maestro, where he was identified . sitting on a vehicle bonnet in Rye Lane. Then he is seen in Money Shop at around 6.55pm, leaving seven minutes later for the Post Office. Footage from there show the door had . been forced open and Burls returning with burning material, which he . used to start a fire on the floor which he feeds with leaflets and other . papers. Acting manager Isobel Martin said there was £55,000 of damage. At Regen’s shortly afterwards Burls can be seen outside the store which has had its shutters damaged already. A number of thugs can be seen attacking the shop on footage captured on residents’ mobiles above. A key witness saw Burls go in and set light to clothes with a lighter. The owner, who suffered up to . £390,000 losses including £30,000 stock which was not covered by . insurance, said he felt ‘hopeless’ as he watched the blaze take hold . live on the television news. Next door, Greggs, which suffered £400,000 damage was ‘engulfed in fire’ which spread from Regen’s. Carnage: Firemen hose down a bus set on fire on Peckham Road in nearby Camberwell . Its manager too watched the blaze spread on TV and returned two days’ later to find the ‘shell’. Ronan Halvey, a resident of the above . flat, saw a male taking photos of himself using a mobile phone outside . Regen’s as others looted the shop. He saw a female looter mouth ‘fire’ at him. Shelley Griffith, defending, said Burls was expelled from school aged 11 and has only one previous conviction. He explained the 23-year-old’s . involvement as being down to a ‘lack of maturity’ and added: ‘He was . shocked when he saw the photographs. ‘I don’t think he realised in his mind, what he intended to do.' Southwark Council today welcomed the . sentence and confirmed that Burls had voluntarily given up the tenancy . of his council flat in Peckham. Peter John, leader of Southwark . Council, said: 'I'm sure that many people who live . and work in Peckham will be satisfied that this sentence is appropriate . and reflects the seriousness of his crime and the impact it has had on . the community.'",Police spotted Andrew Burls's distinctive eyes in CCTV .
"My close friend's summer wedding was in Bibury, the prettiest village in the UK, according to the most influential designer of the 19th century William Morris. And he should know. Not only was I to be an usher but I was also fortunate enough to be staying in the UK's first and only residential nature reserve, better known as Lower Mill Estate. While my friends lugged their wedding outfits and bags into their hastily-arranged B&Bs, I was picking up the keys to Aspen Lodge - a timber-clad four-bed, four-bathroom detached retreat set within the 550-acres of this gated, luxury second home development in the Cotswolds. The rear balcony of Aspen Lodge, a four-bed, four-bathroom timber-clad lakeside home in the Cotswolds . Established in the early 1990s by the late Jeremy Paxton, the one-time champion waterskier, pilot and entrepreneur, with the aim of providing sustainable living alongside wildlife, it now attracts wealthy professionals and celebrities looking to get away from the hustle and bustle. Paxton sadly passed away last year aged just 53 and left his family to continue his legacy - a challenge they have clearly accepted with pride and gusto. As my friends unpacked and looked around their respective hotels, I took one of the estate's brand new mountain bikes out for a ride across the reserve and over to the on-site shop to stock up of eggs, bacon, wine and bread. The spa's outdoor pool, even in September, was heaven - heated and surrounded by comfortable sun loungers . Lower Mill Estate sits at the heart of the Cotswolds - one of England’s most diverse, attractive and appealing areas. It has a rich heritage of country houses, wildlife parks, nature reserves and gardens and it’s dotted with idyllic villages and historic towns such as Bourton-on-the-Water, Stow-on-the-Wold, Tetbury and Cirencester. The regency pleasures of Cheltenham and the Georgian glories of Bath are less than twenty miles south west of the estate. From the shop I cycled over to the spa that comes complete with indoor and outdoor heated pools, a technogym, sauna, steam rooms, and Europe's first lily-filtered outdoor eco-pool. There's also a lounge in which to relax and treatment rooms with over 60  therapies from which to choose. Beyond the spa are eight lakes and two rivers that provide the perfect opportunity for boating and fishing. For those looking to get close to nature, the woodlands and hedgerows are home to numerous species of plants, including several varieties of orchid, with three bird hides providing the ideal spot for quiet contemplation of the native wildlife. The view from the rear balcony. So nice to wake to the sound of birdsong and the fresh breeze from the lake . Lower . Mill Estate offers three nights in a two-bedroom luxury apartment (sleeping . up to 4), from £453 on a self-catering basis and including spa access . It is approximately one hour 45 minutes from London. It sits surrounded by acres of lakes, woods and meadows . There is a well-equipped on site shop. Guests can rent bikes, canoes and paddle boards . I couldn't believe that only two hours before I was loading my car in West London. I knew it was only a matter of time before my friends showed up wanting to look around and I was only too ready to show it off. By the time they arrived I was perched out on the back terrace, having lit the BBQ and opened the giant glass doors to both front and back balconies. The one thing that struck all of them while navigating their way around the lakes to Aspen Lodge was just how unique each and every house is on the estate. All are individually designed with prices for three nights in a two-bedroom luxury apartment (sleeping up to 4) starting from £453, on a self-catering basis, including spa access. On the day of the wedding we woke to blue sky, balcony doors wide open and a beautiful breeze ripping off the back lake. All of the Lower Mill Estate homes are spacious, airy and naturally well lit thanks to these gigantic windows . My friends gather in the huge, fully-equipped kitchen, for a few pre-wedding beverages . The boys loaded a car with the usher suits and headed over to the groom’s hotel room above the village pub in nearby Barnsley, just outside Cirencester. One ushers lunch later and we were off to Cripps Barn for the wedding and party. As the bride and groom, Hannah and Dan, made their vows, and we stood watching, a butterfly fluttered in and out of the pews and remained for most of the service. A poignant moment that seemed to capture the specialness of the day. Dinner and the speeches passed, as they too often do, like a blur as conversation whirred and drinks flowed before I headed back in a taxi to Lower Mill. Lower Mill estate sits in the midst of acres of woods and meadows - it's restful and peaceful to the extreme . Bride and groom, Dan and Hannah, on their special day (left) and the ushers (right), excuse the brown shoes . The beautiful people! I forgot how much fun it is to be in a swimming pool with good friends . The bride and groom joined us all the following day for the perfect post-wedding catch-up. We rode the bikes to the spa and spent the late afternoon swimming in the outdoor heated pool before heading back for a barbecue on the front terrace. We ate outside as the sun went down and toasted the amazing weekend and the beautiful surroundings that made it the perfect wedding. What you want from a mini-break is a sense of discontinuity - to leave and feel you've ticked the boxes and made the most of your few days. You get that at Lower Mill. The luxury of the homes and the resort itself make it hard to leave, even for the beauty of the Cotswolds. But that's no bad thing. Three nights at Aspen Lodge on Lower Mill Estate cost from £1050.

"Accused: Dr William 'Phil' Werschler received a $600,000 settlement from Washington state after being falsely accused of drug-fuelled orgies by his ex-wife . A Spokane dermatologist won a $600,000 settlement and rare public apology from Washington state health officials who went public with charges of drug abuse and medical fraud based on a bogus tip from his ex-wife. The payment to Dr William 'Phil' Werschler is among the largest settlements in decades by the state Department of Health involving a physician, agency officials said. The public apology might be the first of its kind in the state. In a separate lawsuit, Werschler collected more than $100,000 from his ex-wife, Kara Werschler, who did not immediately return a message. She ignited the investigation late in the couple's bitter divorce by filing an anonymous complaint studded with accusations of office cocaine binges, sex orgies with staff and patients, hiring prostitutes and falsification of medical drug records. The case decimated his practice and personal life, he told The Spokesman-Review last week. 'This was a good faith effort to protect the public, but there were oversights during the investigation,' the state's official apology said. 'We apologize for those oversights and regret any damage done to Dr. Werschler's personal goodwill, reputation and the distress this has caused his family.' Despite the apology, Phil Werschler, 54, said there remains an undercurrent of suspicion. 'I have the scarlet letter on me as a doctor, a husband and father,' he said. His children were teased at school. Pharmaceutical and research companies withdrew his professional affiliations. Longtime friends and medical colleagues distanced themselves. State officials said they were duty bound to investigate the anonymous allegations that eventually looped back to the ex-wife, according to depositions. But the state's two-year probe spiraled into conspiracy, vendetta and a complete loss of investigative protocol and perspective, said Phil Werschler's attorneys. Place of work: He works out of this medical park in Spokane, Washington . Top health officials now use the case as a teaching tool, and 'new practices are in place to prevent these types of oversights in the future,' the official apology said. Department of Health spokesman Donn Moyer said the case helped prompt a review and policy change in matters of investigations of licensed professionals. Dwight Correll, who conducted the investigation, kept his job despite Phil Werschler's demands he be fired. Karen Jensen, the assistant health secretary who oversees DOH investigative services, said Correll continues to investigate health care professionals in Spokane.The case has not disarmed investigators or muted the state's role of investigating medical providers, she said.Phil Werschler said the entire episode is the most traumatic thing that ever happened to him. He pondered moving to another town and starting over with his second wife but decided to stay.'This is my home,' he said. 'I won't leave.'","Dr William Werscheler's ex-wife Kara allegedly accused him of drug-fuelled parties in his office by filing anonymous complaint .

"British women are hoarding a staggering 4.67 billion pounds worth of clothes in their wardrobes which they will never wear, according to a new study. The typical woman has six items of unworn clothing in her wardrobe - with the tags still on them. That’s 162 million pieces nationwide. And they have an additional 15 items of clothes and shoes they’ve worn just once and will never put on again. The typical woman has six items of unworn clothing in her wardrobe - with the tags still on them . Most confess it’s because they got carried away in the sales, while 28 per cent have bought items too small as inspiration to slim. These women were typically aiming to lose a stone in weight to squeeze into their tops and dresses.The result is that the typical British woman admits harbouring 173 pounds worth of clothes they have no intention of wearing but can't bear to throw out. The research, by British Heart Foundation (BHF) Shops, suggests the main reason for splashing out on clothes or shoes which will never see the light of day is the irresistible appeal of a bargain. A third of women (36 per cent) got carried away and snapped something up in a sale, before realising it was quite unsuitable. A quarter of the women polled bought clothes or footwear without trying them on, only to find they did not fit . A quarter (23 per cent) bought clothes or footwear without trying them on, only to find they did not fit. And one in six (17 per cent) are clinging on to clothes they bought too small in the hope it would spur them on to slim down - to no avail. Half of women (45 per cent) admit to having clothes which remain unworn because they are too tight. Meanwhile, 25 per cent leave items in the wardrobe because they are unflattering and 12 per cent keep hold of unwanted gifts in case they need to show they still have them. The unworn items most likely to be packing the nation’s wardrobes are high heels, tight dresses, bright or logo T-shirts, skinny jeans, low-cut tops, miniskirts, bikinis, hot pants and crop tops. Office worker Lorna Rousewell, 25, of Portsmouth, Hants, said: 'I’ve got unworn tops and dresses hanging in my wardrobe which still have the labels on. 'I love a bargain and tend to get carried away in the sales. Then you get home, try them on and they don’t look as good. But if they were bought in the sale you often can’t a proper refund. It’s such a waste.'BHF Shops, which surveyed 2,274 people, is appealing for bags of unwanted things this September as they launch the Great British Bag-athon in the fight for every heartbeat. It found a quarter of women (28 per cent) have purchased an item of clothing in a size too small as inspiration to lose weight. Meanwhile 20 per cent admit the clothing looked great in the shop, on a celebrity, model or friend - but not so hot when they got it home. Diane Locke, BHF Deputy Retail Director, said: 'We’re all guilty of hanging onto clothes we’ve barely worn or in many cases, never worn at all. 'It’s interesting women have so many items they’ve not worn at all and that these are worth as much as £173. 'BHF shops have the perfect solution for the items cluttering your wardrobe this month - the UK’s biggest stock donation appeal, the Great British Bag-athon.'Fashion expert Hilary Alexander said: 'People often buy items on impulse, without trying them on properly, and only realise once they get home that they’re not flattering or don’t fit well. 'We all have to accept that if we haven’t worn an item after owning it for six months it’s time to move on.'","Average woman has six pieces of unworn clothing in her wardrobe .

"George Michael is used to delivering show-stopping performances when he takes to the stage. But on Thursday, the stage was the M1 near St Albans, Hertfordshire, which was closed after the singer was involved in a crash in his Range Rover during rush hour. Michael was recovering last night after being airlifted to hospital with a head injury following the accident. Worry: The M1 is brought to a standstill as George Michael is checked after a crash in his Range Rover . An ambulance crew was so concerned at . the 49-year-old’s condition that a  helicopter was summoned, and the . motorway was closed for half an hour while it landed to take Michael . away. Although the ambulance service said . he suffered a head injury, Michael was well enough to be discharged from . hospital last night. No other vehicle was involved in the incident, which happened just before 6pm near the junction with the M25. His spokesman Connie Filippello said: ‘George Michael was a passenger in a vehicle involved in a traffic accident, no third party was involved. He is being treated for superficial cuts and bruises but is fine. We have no further comment at this time.’ Singer George Michael, pictured ahead of his sentencing for driving under the influence of drugs at Highbury magistrates court, was injured in a car crash last night . The singer, who has enjoyed a successful solo career since finding fame in the 1980s duo Wham!, is banned from driving. Three years ago he was jailed for eight weeks for crashing a Range Rover into a shop in north London while under the influence of drugs. In July 2010 George Michael famously crashed his Range Rover into a shop in north London. the following September he received an eight-week prison sentence. He . was also given a five-year driving ban after he pleaded guilty to . driving under the influence of drugs and possessing cannabis. The star had earlier been banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service in 2006. He had been convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes. He was also disqualified from driving for five years, having served a two-year ban imposed in 2006 when he was convicted of driving while on drugs after being found slumped in his Mercedes. Speaking at the singer’s home in Highgate, North London, last night, Michael’s boyfriend Fadi Fawaz, 39, said: ‘He is perfectly fine. Of course I was worried, but I have spoken to him and he is good.‘He suffered a few bruises but there is nothing to worry about. I have no idea what happened, I wasn’t there.’ Hertfordshire Police said: ‘The exact  circumstances of what happened are unclear at this time, and until further investigations have been carried out it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.’ An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said that a 49-year-old man ‘sustained a head injury and following treatment, stabilisation and immobilisation by land and air ambulance crews, he was flown to hospital for further care’. Only 18 months ago, Michael – real name Georgios Panayiotou – spent a month fighting for his life in an Austrian hospital after a severe bout of pneumonia. He fell ill while preparing for a concert in Vienna, and needed a tracheotomy to keep him breathing when he slipped into a coma. The singer, pictured performing on his Symphonica: The Orchestral Tour, is still being treated in hospital for 'minor cuts and bruises'","The M1 near St Albans, Herts, was closed for an hour and the air ambulance took him to hospital .

"Age shall not weary Roger Federer nor the years condemn, but still the veteran Swiss master could not summon up enough to break the spirit of Novak Djokovic. Turning 33 next month and now the father of four, the extraordinary Federer somehow managed to  turn Sunday’s Wimbledon final into a marathon and gave himself a fleeting sight of victory that  may have become a reality against anyone else. Saving a match point in the fourth set and spurning a break point in the decider, he made a nonsense  of the 2013 final — won by Andy Murray, of course — being the most  difficult act to follow. Federer came so close to providing something equally poignant but the difference this time was that the Centre Court, replete with a full quorum of A-listers, did not get the winner it wanted as Djokovic finally prevailed 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 5-7, 6-4 in just under four hours. It might be unfair to cast the 27-year-old Serb as some Blackheart figure, but again he will have felt almost friendless, faced this time with the ageing hero rather than his British contemporary trying to make history.

The one-sided nature of the crowd was a . disadvantage but his most potent opponent other than the man across the . net was the demon left inside him from so many recent Grand Slam final . defeats. Five times in his last six . championship matches he had been beaten, usually from promising . positions, and that gnawed away as he desperately tried to close out a . rampaging Federer in the fourth. Federer was playing a different game, . and not just how he sought to attack the net in a way that will have had . many of the watching champions such as Rod Laver purring. For Federer this was about adding to . his 17 major titles and achieving a historic eighth at Wimbledon. He was . playing for his legacy and  the chance to put distance between his . personal tally and that of the chasing Rafael Nadal, who is on 14.

If so, his last appearance in a  final . at SW19 will leave the hazy memory of someone who matched effortless . style with a competitive spirit so evident in a fourth set of  mesmeric . theatre. The third-set tiebreak had been an . exemplar of why Wimbledon 2012 is the only Grand Slam that Federer has . won in the last four and a half years. Faced with the warrior spirits of . Nadal, Djokovic and (sometimes) Murray, he had again flinched when it . most matters. This is what happens with the onset of age and perhaps, . the statistics suggest, the burden of parental responsibility. It was there in his hesitant approach . to the net at 2-3, or the edgy forehand error at 3-5, the  marginal lack . of conviction that does not afflict his younger rivals  as much. And it was there at the start of the . fourth set when Djokovic took advantage of his heavy-legged  positioning . to break for 3-1, as the crowd resigned itself to consoling their idol . and being back in the bar for Pimm’s o’clock.

Federer’s comeback for 2-3 was a false . start as he was broken again, but from 2-5 down he extracted one . throaty roar after another from the Centre Court crowd as he reeled off . five games with a combination of groundstroke winners and finely judged . forays to the net. Djokovic loves a target at the net and . passed him repeatedly, but Federer would not be daunted as he preyed on . the doubts that he knew would float to the surface for an increasingly . agitated opponent, who was demanding more respect from a reluctant . assembly. At 4-5 down Federer saw off . Djokovic’s first match point with one of the 29 aces he sent down during . the course of the afternoon. The line judge’s naked eye disallowed . it and ironically it was HawkEye, an innovation the Swiss has so often . sniffed at, that was needed to confirm its authenticity.

Djokovic needed to summon the physio to rub a sore calf . muscle after the third game and at 3-3, 30-40 came Federer’s chance when . he got the serve back but was forced deep and wide on to his backhand . and could only float the ball into the net. Djokovic’s return of serve, a shot he . has improved to the point of being the all-time master, so nearly . brought him the next game but the seven-times champion three-times saved . himself. Only at 5-4 did  the pressure tell sufficiently for Djokovic . to gain the winning break of serve, with anti-climactic ease.

A trademark ace helps the seven-time champion to the tie-break win. SECOND SET: 6-4 Djokovic – The Serb breaks Federer early on and never looks back, with only two unforced errors in the whole set. THIRD SET: 7-6 (7-4) Djokovic – Again neck and neck with no breaks, but this time Novak dominates the tie-break. FOURTH SET: 7-5 Federer – The most thrilling set in the match by far, with five breaks of serve. Djokovi leads 5-2 but throws it all away, missing  championship point in the process. Federer wins five games in a row to send it into a decider. FIFTH SET: 6-4 Djokovic – Both men on their last legs but the 27-year-old finds some of his best tennis when it matters most.

"The father of the woman murdered by philandering music teacher Andrew Lindo spoke of the killer’s ‘monstrous and evil deceit’ yesterday after he was jailed for a minimum of 22 years. Robert Stewart, 55, choked back tears as he described Lindo as ‘a coward of the first order’ and a cheat with an enormous ego who ‘delivered an acting masterclass’ to conceal his womanising and his terrible crime. ‘He has lied, misled, abused, cheated and stolen from us on a monstrous scale.’ The murder victim's father Robert Stewart, pictured outside Bradford Crown Court today, described Andrew Lindo as a 'coward' after he was jailed for life . Guilty: Andrew Lindo murdered his fiancée Marie Stewart who was found dead at the family home in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire . Lindo, 29, strangled, battered and . stabbed Marie Stewart, his fiancée and the mother of his two little . children, last December after she found out he was cheating on her with . another woman. He hid her body in the garage and convinced friends and family she had left him for another man. On Christmas Day, a week after the . murder, Mr Stewart spent time with Lindo and the children at their home . in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, whilst his daughter’s body lay only a few . feet away. He was fooled into thinking she had walked out on her fiancé. Duped: Dance teacher Alison Doram, left, and Angela Rylance, right, were two of those known to have fallen for Lindo's lies . Outside Bradford Crown Court Mr . Stewart, a sales consultant, said: ‘It is difficult to imagine a more . gut-wrenching experience than to be told that your daughter’s body has . been found in the garage of their family home.’ He said Lindo’s actions in hiding the body for seven weeks before he was arrested ‘compounded’ the family’s suffering. Mr Stewart said Lindo lived in a fantasy world. ‘He delivered an acting masterclass . to the world and his unfortunate female victims and painted Marie as a . lazy, feckless mother who had abandoned her children for a “better . life”. He stopped at nothing to blacken her name in the very worst . possible terms.’ Lindo is known to have cheated on . Miss Stewart with four others – including a girl music pupil aged only . 15 – during the months before the murder. Mr Stewart added: ‘He presented and . cultivated this image of the perfect father figure whilst juggling . affairs with numerous unsuspecting women, often at the same time, to . further indulge his enormous ego. Andrew Lindo has blighted the lives of . his children for ever and caused irreparable pain to us all.’ Miss Stewart in her graduation gown at the university where she met . Lindo.

"The No 9 might be more commonly associated with football's most deadly strikers, but it's another shirt number which is leading the way when it comes to Premier League goals this season.

"Texas Senator Ted Cruz is taking steps to officially renounce his Canadian citizenship. He said in a recent interview, 'I have retained counsel that is preparing the paperwork to renounce the citizenship,' adding that he expects the process to be complete sometime in 2014. The senator, now in his first term, has said that he was completely unaware he possessed dual USA and Canadian citizenship until a Dallas newspaper reported it in August this year. Canadian: Cruz was born in Canada and has dual citizenship, a fact he claims to have been unaware of . The Dallas Morning News reported that when Cruz was born, his parents lived in Calgary where his Cuban-born father worked the oil fields. He lived in Canada until the age of four, when he moved to Texas. He said his American mother had understood that it would take affirmative action to claim Canadian citizenship and that he had never even been aware he possessed it. In actual fact, like the U.S., Canada confers citizenship to anyone born on its soil, regardless of the nationality of the parents. Many have questioned Cruz's eligibility to run for President in the future as a result of his foreign birth. According to Politifact, Cruz - full name Rafael Edward Cruz - most likely is eligible to run.The Constitution states that any candidate for president must be a resident within the US for 14 years and a 'natural born citizen' - but does not explain what exactly that means. In the absence of a Supreme Court ruling on the issue, legal experts have interpreted the phrase to mean 'citizenship held at birth,' which Cruz has by virtue of his mother. The Republican, whose mother is American and father is Cuban, is taking steps to renounce his Canadian citizenship . Just to be on the safe side, though, Cruz is relinquishing his Canadian citizenship once and for all. 'Serving as a U.S. senator, I think it's appropriate that I be only an American,' he told CNN. Cruz told the Dallas Morning News that the issue came up when he met with Donald Trump recently. Trump famously demanded to see President Obama's birth certificate after repeatedly speculating that Obama was not a citizen of the United States. In an appearance on Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor in 2011, he suggested a birth certificate would show that the President is Muslim. After seeing the proof that Obama was indeed born in Hawaii, he continued to raise questions over its authenticity. Mr America: Donald Trump speculated about President Obama's citizenship but apparently didn't dwell on Cruz's during a recent meeting between the two . Cruz told the Dallas Morning News that the issue of his birth had come up with Trump, though 'not in any significant respect.' Trump insisted Obama may have violated the Constitution despite proof of the President having been born to a U.S. mother on U.S. soil. What does he make of Ted Cruz, born to a U.S. mother on Canadian soil? Cruz declined to comment further, saying 'My political perspective is focused on representing the state of Texas,' he said.","Senator Ted Cruz has lawyers working to renounce his Canadian citizenship .

"A homeless charity has warned of a 'crisis' after figures revealed the number of new homes being built is at its lowest level since records began. The number of new homes built in 2010/11 has dropped by 6% on the previous year, government figures have showed. Just 121,200 new homes were built in England which means this year will see the fewest homes built since 1923. Worrying decline: The number of new homes being built in England this year is at its lowest level since 1923 . Campbell Robb, Shelter's chief . executive, said: 'These figures will be a huge disappointment for . millions of people up and down the country. 'Decades . of failure to build enough homes hasn't just resulted in sky-high house . prices, but is also responsible for an increasingly expensive rental . market, with recent Shelter . research revealing average private rents are now unaffordable for . ordinary working families in over half of local authorities in England. Work to do: Housing Minister Grant Shapps said the Government is taking 'radical action' to address England's housing need . 'In . this country every two minutes someone faces the nightmare of losing . their home as more and more people struggle to keep up with their rent . or mortgage. 'We are . now at crisis point and the upcoming Government Housing Strategy must . step forward with a long-term vision to build more homes to tackle our . escalating housing crisis.' This years figures represent a 6 per cent decrease on the 128,680 new homes built in the previous year, and compares with a steeper 23 per cent fall the year before that, the Department for Communities and Local Government said. London saw the biggest decrease of new homes, with a 27 per cent fall on the previous year to reach 17,830 in the latest figures. The North East saw the biggest supply increase at 26 per cent, reaching a figure of 4,710 more homes in 2010/11. After tailing off slightly between 2000 and 2002, housing supply increased for six years in a row, peaking at 207,370 additional homes in 2007/08. The overall fall in the latest figures was due to 6,500 fewer new-build completions, 1,180 fewer conversions, and 2,060 fewer extra dwellings resulting from changes of use. The figures were offset by an increase of other types of accommodation, such as mobile homes and temporary dwellings, which rose by 840. Fewer homes were also knocked down, with a fall in demolitions of 1,440 on the previous year. John Stewart, Home Builders Federation director of economic affairs, said: 'The figures are very concerning at a time when we already have an acute housing shortage. 'Government needs to work with the industry and lenders to address lack of mortgage availability. 'It must also end the ongoing vacuum in planning policy and implement a planning system that delivers enough land to build the homes the country desperately needs.' The annual report shows the supply of housing in England by measuring the absolute change in dwelling stock, including the number of completed new house builds and gains or losses through conversions and changes of use, minus demolitions. The latest new homes figure includes 117,700 new-build homes, 5,050 additional homes resulting from conversions, 11,540 extra homes resulting from a change of use, as well as 1,810 other gains and a loss of 14,890 homes through demolitions. Housing Minister Grant Shapps said: 'Today's figures clearly show that we are still living with the legacy of a draconian system of top-down targets that pitted communities against developers. 'We're already taking radical action to turn the tide, and will shortly publish a Housing Strategy outlining both the measures we're already taking and some new moves we'll make to get Britain building again. 'These include scrapping targets and instead ensuring that, for the first time, local people see the benefits of growth in their area through the New Homes Bonus, which matches the council tax raised on new properties for six years. 'It also includes our Affordable Homes programme, which is set to exceed original expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes, on top of the 100,000 we want to help get built by making public land available to developers.' The construction sector enjoyed a surprise expansion in October but economists today warned of more challenges ahead as confidence hit a three-year low. The growth was driven by a surge in new orders from businesses, with civil engineering broadly stagnant and housebuilding in decline for the fifth month in a row. But confidence dropped to its lowest level since December 2008 - when the UK was in the depths of the recession - amid Government cutbacks and uncertainties about the strength of private sector demand. A closely watched Markit/CIPS survey, . in which a reading above 50 represents expansion, hit a five-month high . of 53.9, up from 50.1 in September. Economists had expected it to flatline at around 50, which marks no growth. The figures, although improved, will not significantly allay fears that the UK economy will contract in the final quarter of 2011, after woeful manufacturing figures released yesterday. CIPS chief executive David Noble said the survey indicated that the sector had accelerated 'at some pace after a broad stagnation in September' but was 'nothing to get excited about'. He added: 'Due to current economic conditions, it may be some time yet before we start seeing the sustained growth the sector really needs. 'Across the sector as a whole, confidence about future business activity plunged to its lowest in almost three years, with optimism fading as constructors come to recognise that there are more challenges yet to come.' Official figures released yesterday revealed the UK's GDP increased by a better-than-expected 0.5% between July and September, up from the 0.1% rise in the previous quarter. But these were overshadowed by a Markit/CIPS survey that showed the manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest rate since mid-2009 in October. Today's survey showed the construction sector continued to recruit more staff in October, although at a slower rate than before. Inflation on goods rose markedly in October, having hit a 10-month low in September. It was driven upwards by the rising cost of fuel and raw materials. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the sector is 'far from racing ahead and it clearly faces an extremely challenging environment' as the Government cuts spending on schools, hospitals and infrastructure. He added that housebuilding activity will continue to be constrained amid soft prices and 'a worrisome outlook'. He said: 'While the pick-up in activity in October is to be welcomed, it does not hugely dilute fears that the economy could contract in the fourth quarter.' Worries over the state of the UK's economy will be heightened tomorrow if a survey for the powerhouse services sector, which accounts for three-quarters of the economy, shows a weaker performance.","Number of new homes built in England drops 6 per cent in a year .

"Google hopes a new low cost laptop could tempt buyers away from new tablets from Apple and Microsoft. The lightweight computer will sell for £229 ($249) and is being made with Samsung. It was revealed just days before Apple is expected to unveil a low cost version of its iPad tablet, and Microsoft and Amazon begin selling their tablet computers. See the computer in action below . Google has launched an aggressive advertising campaign for its new laptop, claiming the £229 machine is 'for everyone' Unlike a traditional laptop, the Chromebook has no hard drive, instead keeping all of its information on Google's servers. This means that while most functions can still be used without an internet connection, some are limited. Google also supplies a virtual Drive for the machine, which users can also access from a desktop Pc and even their mobile phone. The Google machine's software is based on Google's Chrome web browser. Like other so-called Chromebooks, this laptop doesn't have a hard drive, instead storing information on Google's internet servers.

'I think it's generally an exciting time in the computing . industry.' Like tablets, the . discount Chromebook will rely on a computer chip design known as ARM, . instead of Intel microprocessors. The ARM architecture is more . energy efficient, extending the duration of batteries between charges. With . an 11.6-inch (29.46-centimeter) screen, the new Chromebooks also will . have a larger display than tablets selling in the same price range. The Chromebook launch comes as Google suffered the single largest . plunge in stock market history on Thursday when $24billion (£15billion) was wiped off the company's value after its results were accidentally . released. The catastrophic error revealed that profits were down by 20 per cent. Trading . in the company's stock was halted when its shares fell by nine per cent . in just eight minutes following the release of its disappointing . earnings report. The report . was leaked ahead of schedule when a printing firm working for Google . put out an incomplete press release without authorisation from the . online giant. The plunge prompted worries that a . second dot.com crash could be on the way. Google's troubles coincide . with a steady fall in Facebook's share price and the ongoing struggles of newer start-ups such as Groupon and Zynga. Google's . third-quarter profits fell 20 per cent on a year earlier to . $2.18billion (£1.35billion) - well below analysts' expectations. The dire results were due to be issued after the markets had finished trading for the day. But because they were released early, investors were able to dump their stock and send the shares into a nosedive.

Google Inc. appears to be trying to beat Microsoft and Apple to the punch with the discount Chromebook. Microsoft is poised to release Windows 8, a dramatic makeover of its famous operating system, on Oct. 26. The long-awaited makeover is designed to run on touch-based tablets, as well as laptop and desktop computers. A variety of manufacturers will be selling a hodgepodge of Windows 8-powered personal computers and tablets. Apple says it plans to show off a new product Tuesday. The event is widely expected to be the coming-out party for a slightly smaller version of its hot-selling iPad. The mini iPad is expected to feature a 7.85-inch (19.94-centimeter) screen compared to the nearly 10-inch (25.4-centimeter) screen of the pioneering iPad. Industry analysts expect Apple to price a smaller iPad in the $249 to $299 range in an effort to siphon sales away from other scaled-down tablets, such as Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon.com Inc.'s Kindle Fire.","Launch comes amid Google share price crisis .

"Bosnia striker Edin Dzeko will miss Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier away to Israel due to a calf injury and could be sidelined for up to three weeks, team doctor Reuf Karabeg said. 'It's a very serious injury and requires the kind of treatment whose time-frame unfortunately rules out a quick return,' Karabeg told the Bosnian football federation website on Monday. Dzeko said: 'I am extremely disappointed with the news that I will miss this match but I have faith in my team mates and believe that they have it in them to get a result.' Bosnia team doctor Reuf Karabeg said Edin Dzeko could be sidelined for up to three weeks with a calf injury . The Manchester City striker was replaced by midfielder Frank Lampard during their 2-2 draw at QPR . Dzeko's absence will be a bitter blow to injury-hit Bosnia's hopes of getting their Group B campaign on track after taking only two points from the opening three games. His strike partner Vedad Ibisevic was earlier ruled out as a long-term casualty while defender Avdija Vrsajevic and central midfielder Tino Sven Susic are also unlikely to recover in time for the clash in Haifa. Dzeko limped off the pitch four minutes after coming on as a substitute in Manchester City's 2-2 draw at Queens Park Rangers on Saturday and Bosnia coach Safet Susic said earlier on Monday his team had no chance of winning without their top scorer. 'If Dzeko can't play we will be resigned to playing for a draw against Israel because we have no hope of winning without him,' Susic told Bosnia's FENA news agency. The injury will come as a massive blow for the Bosnians, and manager Safet Susic expressed his worries . 'If that turns out to be the case, we will have to mount a sustained challenge after the winter break and win five of the remaining six games if we are to reach the finals in France.' The Bosnians, who made a group stage exit at the 2014 World Cup finals in June after reaching their first major tournament as an independent nation, drew against Wales and Belgium after suffering a shock home defeat by Cyprus in Euro 2016 qualifying. The poor run has piled the pressure on 59-year old Susic, who has faced a barrage of criticism for his team selection and tactics during the World Cup and at the start of their European Championship qualifiers. With both Dzeko and Ibisevic out, Susic will be forced to field a team with no natural strikers against Israel, meaning that wingers Edin Visca and Izet Hajrovic are likely to be deployed up front.","Bosnia striker Edin Dzeko is out for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Israel .

"Defending champion Serena Williams was thrashed 6-0 6-2 by Simona Halep at the WTA Finals in Singapore. The 18-time Grand Slam champion was remarkably off her game against the world No 4, who had never beaten the American. Halep won the first set in just 20 minutes, as Williams could only put seven points on the board, suffering a bagel set for only the eighth time in her illustrious career.

Having defeated Ana Ivanovic 6-4, 6-4 on Monday in her first red group match, it would have been expected Williams, who had made 16 consecutive victories at the WTA Finals, to ease past Halep having won their three previous meetings. However Halep, brought a high level to the court and pounced on Williams’ temperamental serve to race to the first set. Williams failed to recover, making 36 unforced errors and was broken five times during a flawless performance by Halep.

"The dramatic moment when a devastated Duke of Windsor accused his wife of adultery has been revealed in the previously unseen papers of his former private secretary. In a scene that undermines the myth that the marriage was ‘the greatest love affair in the world’, the former Edward VIII tearfully told Wallis Simpson, the divorcee for whom he gave up the throne in 1936, to break off her relationship with a wealthy playboy. The private notebooks of Anne Seagrim, which she kept secretly during her service with the royal couple, offer further evidence that after 13 years of marriage, the Duchess had became bored with her husband, leading to an affair with a young American 19 years her junior, Jimmy Donahue, who until then had been a promiscuous homosexual. Scroll down for video . The Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1951, the year after she started her affair with Jimmy Donahue . In an undated eyewitness account detailing the moment the ex-king became aware of the affair, Miss Seagrim  wrote: ‘The day that he came back from the [New York] Racquets Club where someone had told him “in his own interests” that the Duchess had  been out every night till dawn with the same young man –  he went to his room and lay  on his bed. She came in and, gaily unknowing, went into  [his room]. ‘I heard him choking back  the tears in his voice, telling her what he had heard. I heard him say what he had no doubt rehearsed over and over again – “It’s not because you are the Duchess of Windsor, it’s because you are my wife. Any man would mind his wife  doing this.” ‘His voice wavered. She never said a single word – or at any rate I didn’t hear her voice,  and very soon she came out, all her gaiety gone – walking slowly with her head bent, her face submissive, her eyes blue & bewildered. She gave me a quick glance as she went through my room. ‘She was very quiet and submissive for a long time afterwards. She telephoned immediately cancelling whatever arrangement she had made with the young man.’ And Miss Seagrim says damningly of the Duchess:  ‘She revelled in this shoddy little success.’ The Duchess had started her affair with Donahue aboard  the Queen Mary in May 1950, when she was 54 and he 35, having first met him at his mother’s home in Palm Beach nine years earlier. He was a grandson of the founder of Woolworth’s and led an indolent life after being kicked  out of Choate, the ‘American Eton’, for non-attendance. Jimmy Donahue with the Duchess at a nightclub in New York . The affair continued even after the Duke’s intervention, and came to an end in 1954, when he finally lost patience with his wife’s lover. Miss Seagrim, who worked  at close quarters with the couple in Paris and New York between 1950 and 1954, wrote in her notebook of the Duchess: ‘She naively always hoped to get away with her affairs – brazened it out when another would have given herself away by seeming guilty.’ She added: ‘[She was] determined to have her fun – but when she realised she had been caught out, she didn’t excuse herself or try to fool him. ‘She was also really [regretful] at having upset him because although I was pretty sure she never felt the same passionate love for him as he did for her, she was very fond of him and had set herself the job of making him happy. But it was a “job”. It wasn’t a reciprocal love on the same scale as his for her.’ The notebooks, stored in a recently opened archive in Churchill College, Cambridge, are particularly revealing because throughout her life Miss Seagrim, who died aged 92 in 2011, publicly maintained her devoted support for  the Windsors. Wallis with the Duke at a fancy dress party in America in the 1950s . The Cartier tiger brooch the Duke gave his wife after the affair . She wrote: ‘When HRH was happy, he used to call her “Peaches”. Nothing could be further from the truth!’ And of the Duke she observed: ‘Donaldson [Frances Donaldson, one of the Duke’s early biographers] misses the essential point about his character – his fundamental uncertainty about his sexuality & his ability to be a heterosexual man. He was fundamentally afraid of women.’ For four years, as I revealed in my biography Dancing  With the Devil: The Windsors and Jimmy Donahue, the trio were inseparable. The Duke, who was pathologically worried about money  and happy to allow others to bankroll his expensive lifestyle, knowingly allowed himself  to be cuckolded. Although rumours often swirled about the Duchess’s relationship with Donahue, his previously homosexual love-life led observers to believe that there was no sexual attraction between them. After the affair ended, the dynamic between husband  and wife remained unchanged – he needy, she expecting total devotion. A bejewelled Cartier tiger brooch and matching bracelet which were ordered by the Duke after the affair are being sold  at Christie’s in November and are expected to fetch £1.5 million.","Anne Seagrim kept secret notebooks during her service with the royals .

"When pensioner Jim Higgins decided to clear the brambles from a footpath at the bottom of his garden, he was only trying to help. Many of his neighbours stopped by to thank the former police officer for all his work – which saw him replace a dilapidated fence and build a seat for weary walkers. But not everyone was so delighted by the grandfather’s efforts. Soon Sustrans, the charity which owns the footpath, announced that they had health and safety concerns over his homemade bench. Good deed: Jim Higgins and his dog Nell in front of the path he painstakingly cleared in Cumbria . Following a complaint from the charity, Mr Higgins, 65, was called in to be questioned at his local police station in Whitehaven, Cumbria. He has now been told that he could be charged with the theft of the old fence. Last night Mr Higgins said: ‘I am worried sick that what I believed was a good deed for everyone in the village is going to end up with me having a criminal conviction. ‘I have nothing to hide, I admit I did it. But never did I imagine anyone would be anything but happy. I’m finding it hard to sleep at night and am worried about the future.’ Mr Higgins – who lives with his wife Cath – has six children as well as two young grandchildren. He says he had already asked Sustrans to replace the broken-down fence. But he finally decided to take matters into his own hands after his dog Nell became impaled on one of its rusty spikes. He said: ‘Nell didn’t see the spike, which had become buried by the overgrown vegetation, but it punctured her skull and it is only thanks to the skill of a clever vet that she survived. ‘But it wasn’t only the fence that Sustrans had neglected and allowed to fall into disrepair – the footpath was a jungle of dangerous brambles that snagged horse riders, walkers and cyclists.’ When Mr Higgins spotted a couple of volunteers from Sustrans, he mentioned his plans to replace the fence. ‘They seemed pleased that I was offering to sort it out, so I ploughed on’, he said. Labour of love: Mr Higgins and Nell with his homemade bench built for weary walkers . After cutting down the brambles at the bottom of his garden, Mr Higgins removed what remained of the old fence and sold it for scrap to help pay for new wooden posts. Meanwhile he got on with the back-breaking task of clearing away the brambles and started to fashion a homemade bench. ‘It took me the last month to clear it,’ he said, ‘But it was worth it to see people being able to use that path properly for a change. When a few people stopped me outside my house and said what a good job I’d done, I felt really proud.’ Neighbour Marilyn McCarthy, 60, said: ‘Everyone believes Jim has enhanced the footpath. It used to be an eyesore but now it looks lovely. We are all upset at the way he’s been treated and horrified he could be prosecuted.’ Sustrans spokesman Eleanor Roaf said: ‘Health and safety is really important to us and we ask that people talk to us before doing anything on our land to avoid any risk to the public. We are waiting to hear whether the police wish to press charges.’ Last night a police spokesman said: ‘Cumbria Police are investigating allegations received from another party in relation to property being removed. ‘Whilst this investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment.","Pensioner Jim Higgins decided to cleared from a footpath near his garden .

"He has reported from war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan and witnessed the horrors of the Sri Lankan civil war. But broadcaster Jon Snow has said yesterday that smoking strong cannabis for a scientific experiment terrified him more than any battlefield. The news host has taken part in a programme to demonstrate the effects on the brain of potent ‘skunk’ cannabis. Channel 4 News host Jon Snow, pictured, who has smoked strong cannabis for a scientific experiment says it terrified him more than any war zone he has visited . The Channel 4 programme, called Drugs Live: Cannabis on Trial, will be broadcast on March 3 and sees Mr Snow, former MP Matthew Parris and former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond smoke the drug in a six-month trial approved by the Home Office. Writing on his Channel 4 blog, Mr Snow said: ‘By the time I was completely stoned I felt utterly bereft. I felt as if my soul had been wrenched from my body. There was no one in my world. ‘I was frightened, paranoid, and felt physically and mentally wrapped in a dense blanket of fog. ‘I’ve worked in war zones, but I’ve never been as overwhelmingly frightened as I was when I was in the MRI scanner after taking skunk. I would never do it again.’ His comments come as a study published by the Lancet medical journal this week found that the risk of psychosis is three times higher for users of skunk cannabis than for non-users. The drug has also been linked to paranoid episodes, memory loss and lack of educational attainment. Writing on his Channel 4 blog, Mr Snow said: ‘By the time I was completely stoned I felt utterly bereft. I felt as if my soul had been wrenched from my body' Mr Snow, who admitted to having been passed the ‘odd spliff of cannabis’ a dozen times in the past, said last night that smoking the much stronger skunk ‘outstripped anything’ he had previously experienced. Skunk is thought to account for around for 80 per cent of the UK drug market and is believed to be more addictive than normal herbal cannabis or its solid form, hash. A study published by the Lancet medical journal this week found that the risk of psychosis is three times higher for users of skunk cannabis than for non-users. Professor Val Curran, a University College London neurologist who organised the trial, said: ‘This is a hugely exciting and important research project which will show how skunk and hash can produce different effects on the human brain, mind and behaviour. ‘My research group were concerned that cannabis addiction in the UK has increased over recent years alongside the increased market dominance of skunk. ‘I hope this new programme will scientifically inform those who use, have used or are thinking of using this drug about the diverse effects of different types of cannabis.’ Skunk has also been linked to paranoid episodes, memory loss and lack of educational attainment . Mr Parris added: ‘Smoking skunk wasn’t cool. It was just horrible, I felt stoned and stupid. The very smell now repels me.’ He said that after inhaling the drug during the experiment he would sometimes find it hard to stand up, according to the Times. 'Losing control is my worst nightmare,' Mr Parris reportedly told the newspaper. 'Yet I have to report that the two weirdest things these sessions did to me — memory blanks even while I was talking and distortions in the perception of time — were only extreme cases of things I’ve often noticed in myself in normal circumstances and drug-free. 'The cannabis heightened and intensified; it did not create.' During the six-month trial, on three separate occasions the volunteers took controlled doses of different forms of medicinal cannabis as well as a placebo under laboratory conditions at UCL. Unlike most other studies, which simply ask people what type of cannabis they use, this trial administered carefully measured amounts of cannabis each with a specified chemical profile. The previous programme, which was broadcast in September 2012, was fiercely criticised as little more than an advert for ecstasy. During that show viewers complained that only one participant was shown to have had a negative response to the illegal drug, while the majority of the volunteers described feelings of well-being, euphoria and warmth.","Channel 4 News host smoked strong cannabis for a scientific experiment .

"An Italian long distance runner is facing disciplinary proceedings for allegedly using a fake penis to beat a dope test. Devis Licciardi, 27, is said to have used a realistic-looking prosthetic containing uncontaminated urine to give a sample following a 10km road race. The allegation echoes a farcical scene from the film Withnail and I, where the titular character tries to avoid a drink-driving arrest by passing off a child's urine as his own.

Officials . at the country's Olympic Committee were immediately informed and he is . due to face a disciplinary hearing in Rome tomorrow and faces a . potential lengthy ban.

The ethnically sensitive product comes in a range of products for customers of various races including white, Latino and black. The device could have been inspired by a scene in the seminal British tragi-comedy Withnail And I. In the film a drunk Withnail, played by Richard E. Grant, tries to fool police who have pulled him over on the motorway by passing urine from a washing-up liquid bottle attached by a tube to his penis. 'You refuse everything but the urine sample,' he says. 'You undo your valve, give them a dose of unadulterated child’s p***, and they have to give you your keys back.'

"According to Andy Warhol everybody gets their 15 minutes of fame. But after 60 years on the throne and in the limelight, one person who has enjoyed far longer in the public eye is Queen Elizabeth. And to mark the end of the monarch's Diamond Jubilee year, four of the famous pop artist's portraits of the long-serving sovereign have gone on display for the first time at Windsor Castle. Bought by the Royal estate back in September, the iconic images have gone on display as part of The Queen: Portraits of a Monarch, a collection unveiled this week, with the exhibition running until next summer. Iconic: The four images of Queen Elizabeth were bought by the Royal estate back in September . Exhibition: They have gone on show as part of The Queen: Portraits of a Monarch . Warhol, who once said that he wanted to be 'as famous as the Queen of England' and who is famed for his images of a Campbells soup tin, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, created the images in 1985. Using an old portrait of the Queen from a decade earlier, Warhol created the colourful pictures in 1985. Featuring bright block colours and sprinkled with diamond dust, the pictures each measure 39 inches by 31.5 inches. The original picture had been taken by Peter Grugeon and was used prominently in the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations. Display: Windsor Castle members with Warhol's pictures . Eye catching: The images have gone on display as part of The Queen: Portraits of a Monarch . In the image, she is wearing the Vladimir tiara, Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee necklace, Queen Alexandra's wedding earrings and King George VI's family order pinned to her garter sash. Warhol created the images as part of his Reigning Queens collection which also featured Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, Queen Margarethe of Denmark and Queen Ntombi Twola of Swaziland. Born Andrew Warhola, the artist initially worked as a commercial artist for magazines and designed advertising and window displays. He came to fame after he began to experiment with reproductions based on advertisements, newspaper headlines and other mass-produced images from American popular culture in the early 1960s. He became internationally famous and exhibited his work all over the world in the 1970s and 1980s before he died suddenly following a gall bladder operation in 1987. As well as Warhol's pictures, the exhibition features a range of different images of the Queen, some taken to mark state visits or anniversaries and others taken for use on coins, stamps and bank notes. It also features works by the likes of Cecil Beaton, Pietro Annigoni and Lucian Freud. Famous: Pop artist Andy Warhol created the four images in 1985 .

"My husband is the kindest, most considerate man in the world. During the seven years we've been married, Ben has done most of the cooking, cleaning and ironing without ever being asked. He brings me an organic buffalo milk cappuccino every morning in bed and once spent hours making fresh syrup from rhubarb to add to my favourite champagne after I'd given birth. And yes, he works full-time. But for all he does for me, anxious to make everything in my life better, he gets a raw deal in return. Unequal partners: Kate with Ben, the 'kindest, most considerate man in the world' I am shamefully neglectful of my wifely duties. In fact, I am the anti-wife. The trouble is that I just can't do the subservient partner thing. Ben is more likely to arrive at our home in Twickenham, South-West London, after a hard day's work and find me having a manicure or checking Facebook than slaving over a hot stove. This may make me sound selfish, but I'm just being honest. At 39, I've never ironed a single item of my husband's clothing. I rarely cook for him either. Why would I bother when he's so much better at it than I am? Last Christmas, he produced a lavish three-course lunch and booked a 15th-century cottage for our whole family to eat it in. All I did was hold out my champagne glass for him to refill while saying: 'Well done, darling.' And if you think I reward his sterling domestic efforts with treats in the bedroom, I'm afraid I fail in that department, too. Intimacy is reserved only for his birthdays - and then just the ones with a zero. I felt occasional pangs of guilt about our unusual dynamic during the first year of our marriage, but now I find it liberating. He even refers to me as the 'household manager' because I'm an expert in the art of delegation. Unusual dynamic: Ben cooks, cleans, and works, while Kate has a manicure, checks Facebook, or writes . Recently, Ben's job for an organic fruit and vegetable box delivery scheme meant he was away on business for three weeks. Before he left, I found him packing the freezer with organic ready meals and ringing round for short-term nannies to take care of our children, Ronnie, six, and Stanley, two. The truth is that I'm just too busy and involved in my career as a writer to be a traditional, caring wife. I work from home and, like most self-employed people in a recession, I push myself to the limit. I set my alarm for 6am so I can squeeze in an hour of work before the school run and I often write until midnight. My job often means being away from home during the evenings and weekends, which means the lion's share of the childcare falls to Ben. Even when I am home, I keep one eye glued to my iPhone for fear of missing a work call. Ben bemoans my inability to achieve a work/life balance. He sees the word 'driven' as a negative, while I think I'm aspirational and ambitious. Now, I know what you're thinking - that I must earn more than Ben. But no, I don't. He's the breadwinner and a domestic god. But my work is so all-consuming there's little of me left to go round by the time I switch off my laptop. Don't get me wrong - I love Ben very much and regard our marriage as happy. And he could never claim breach of contract because he always knew I was a workaholic. Newlyweds: Kate felt occasional pangs of guilt about the way their relationship operated during their first year of marriage, but now she finds it liberating . When we began dating in 2003, I was helping to launch a woman's magazine, which required me to be at work from 8am until 11pm. It was Ben's touching gesture of sending boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts to the office that made me realise what an excellent husband he'd make. But when, in the early throes of our relationship, he mooted the idea I might one day be a 'stay-at-home mum', I bristled. 'But my mum stayed at home for the first five years of my life,' he said. 'That's never going to happen,' I replied sharply. The matter was never raised again. I know my anti-wife stance is unusual and I've heard all the arguments about a happy and harmonious marriage being dependent on shared responsibilities. I understand that if two parents have clearly defined roles - one at home looking after the house, the other out earning the money to pay for it - then life is infinitely more simple and therefore less stressful. So, if my husband was the sole breadwinner and had married a domesticated woman, he'd doubtless come home to a home-cooked meal and ironed shirts hanging in the wardrobe. Ben claims he doesn't mind the way our life is set up. But if I'm being honest, it's because of my selfishness that he has to dress the children and make them breakfast while replying to emails on his BlackBerry. 'I'm just too busy and involved in my career as a writer to be a traditional, caring wife.' It's my fault that he returns home to find no dinner and our children running amok. But I work hard, too, and that changes everything. While I love my children deeply, wiping noses, bottoms and encrusted beans off the floor doesn't inspire me in the way my work does. I'm too busy to share the chores. After a day of writing, I feel happy and complete; after a day with the children, I am frazzled. After the birth of our first son, I went back to my £60,000-a-year job as deputy editor of a national magazine and put Ronnie full-time into an eye-wateringly expensive nursery. I felt guilty about it, and working 8am to 6pm every day and barely seeing my son just compounded that guilt. But I didn't want to give up work. You might think me self-obsessed, but that's a price I'm willing to pay for my happiness. Just before the birth of our second son, I decided to leave my job and pursue a career as a writer after being offered a generous redundancy package. But instead of relaxing into my new job, I allowed work to seep into all areas of my life. That is why I ignored cripplingly painful contractions ten minutes apart and carried on writing to meet a deadline. I was back at work just two weeks after giving birth to Stanley, breast-feeding while conducting tricky phone interviews. Driven: Ben, pictured with their two sons Stanley, 2, and Ronnie, 6, bemoans Kate's inability to achieve a work/life balance . I think I may be in the minority in my role as an anti-wife. I have many friends who put their husband's needs above all else. One has sex with her husband every Friday night without fail 'otherwise he'll be grumpy all weekend' and another, who is blissfully unambitious, supports her partner's blossoming business while raising their three children. 'Being a good partner is paramount,' she says. 'I'd much rather be at home with our children. It just works.' Her relationship is the happiest I know and her children the most content. And I'd be willing to bet her sex life is a lot healthier than mine. But I couldn't be her because I know I couldn't devote my life to being a wife and mother. It doesn't mean I don't adore Ben. The truth is that I'm in awe of the way he looks after me, our sons and our home. He makes my life easier. And he says he enjoys it. Does that make me a selfish, slovenly, neglectful wife? Probably - but it also makes me a happier one.","Kate is too busy with her career as a writer to be a traditional wife .

"A multi-millionaire internet tycoon is facing jail for rubbing his groin against a female tube passenger and travelling back and forth on the Underground while gazing at women’s bottoms. Stefan Glaenzer, the former chairman of music streaming site Last.FM, was spotted staring at two commuters as they waited to board a Central line train at Oxford Circus station. German-born Glaenzer, 51, got off the train one stop later at Bond Street and . then travelled back to Oxford Circus, all the while standing behind women on . the train and platforms. 'Mr Glaenzer was standing unnecessarily close to one female, looking down at her back,’ said prosecutor Robert Short. On a second trip to Bond Street, Glaenzer was seen by plain clothes officers standing close to another woman on the packed train. They looked on as he thrust his groin against her backside. Glaenzer, founder of technology hub White Bear Yard in Clerkenwell, admitted sexually assaulting the woman, who cannot be named, at Westminster Magistrates’ Court. He claimed he was on a drugs binge at the time of the incident,  last August 8. ‘He does not come to offer excuses for his actions, but simply to bring to the court’s attention that this matter happened in fact he had taken cannabis’, said Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, defending. ‘This conviction has devastated him personally and professionally. ‘He has lost his good character that he has maintained for his entire life.’ She added: ‘He has smoked drugs for some considerable time, but has never experienced anything like this. 'Devastated': The father of three immediately confessed to his wife and has promised to address his drug habit, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told . ‘He has committed this offence while under the influence of an intoxicating substance, and he simply can’t believe what has happened.’ Glaenzer, a father of three, immediately confessed to his wife and has promised to take steps to address his drug habit, the court heard. He asked to be sentenced immediately with a fine, but magistrate Jessica Baldwin asked for a pre-sentence report to be prepared first. ‘We are concerned this offence appears to be planned, aggravated by the fact your genitals, albeit above clothing, touched the female’, she said. ‘Your drug use is an aggravating feature, not mitigation’, she told the tycoon. Shameful: Glaenzer, hailed as of Europe's top investors by TechCrunch in 2010, was spotted standing very close to two commuters at a busy Oxford Circus (file picture) He will have to sign the Sex Offenders Register as a result of this conviction. Glaenzer, a DJ for 15 years, was the co-founder Ricardo.de, one of the first European online auction websites, and became chairman of Last.FM in 2004. He sold his stake in the site for £22million in 2007 and currently sits on the board of health and is an investor in beauty website Wahanda.com. He was hailed as of Europe’s top investors by TechCrunch in 2010, and also works for venture capital firm Passion Capital. Glaenzer, of Notting Hill, west London, pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault. He was released on unconditional bail ahead of the sentencing hearing on December 20.","Stefan Glaenzer, 51, travelled back and forth on trains looking at women's bodies .

"For one lucky sheep his ability to be a real woolly jumper has saved him from the pot after a farmer's grand-daughter spotted his extraordinary ability to leap over fences and began training him. The ram, named Lavender because owners initially thought he was female, now follows 13-year-old Isobel Brown, wherever she goes in the fields near Ellastone, Staffordshire. Lavender can be seen jumping over hurdles and streams in a video of one of their training sessions. Scroll down for video . Lavender the ram was trained to jump over hurdles and streams by being given croissants and Ribena as rewards . Farmer's granddaughter Isobel Brown demonstrates to Lavender the jumps she wants him to do and he follows suit . Isobel can be seen rattling a metal cup to coax Lavender to jump, calling out commands and words of encouragement: 'Over! Good boy!' She said: 'I train him to jump. The highest he's ever jumped is about one metre. In daily training sessions Isobel jumps over obstacles and calls out commands to Lavender the two-year-old ram . A special hurdle has been made for Lavender, who has been trained to jump up to 3ft over the wooden bar . Lavender was saved from the slaughterhouse when Isobel noticed his ability to jump very high over fences . ‘I train him once a day - as much as possible basically - when I'm free and he follows me around.’ Isobel uses treats to train Lavender, ‘He likes anything - from corn to croissants - he's very greedy. 'He even started licking my drinking bottle a few weeks ago - it had Ribena in it and he now can't get enough of that either. ‘I show him a jump, I jump it, and then he follows me - most of the time. And if not I have to stand over the jump, with one leg each side and entice him over. 'And then he knows to jump it and gets rewarded. It's basically how you train a dog - you reward it when it's been good. The two-year-old sheep, on of 60 on her grandfather's farm, was spared the slaughterhouse when Isobel noticed his agility. Isobel added: ‘He's not a perfect specimen for breeding and was going to go for slaughter but granddad now says I can keep him.’ Isobel has made a special hurdle for the jumping sheep - she has measured different heights for the bar to go on. She normally starts him off at 2ft and gradually raises the bar to as close to 3ft as he can manage before he gets full up with treats and wanders off to play with the rest of the flock. Isobel's mother, Victoria Goodall, said: 'I think it's wonderful that Isobel absolutely adores Lavender. After school she makes sure the sheep are okay and reports back to her granddad.

'I thought I would smarten up for any job interviews I may have. I thought it would be a fresh start. 'I wasn’t nervous when I got it cut, I was just ready for a change and wanted something different.

He said: 'I normally spent just 20 minutes getting all the tangles out of it and I would brush it and then I would let it dry naturally.' And Timothy says despite his new look, he could still be tempted to grow his hair back to a longer length.

"An investigation into Birmingham schools at the centre of a plot to introduce hardline Islamist teaching has found pupils were illegally segregated and non-Muslim students were discriminated against. Inspectors also revealed that the GCSE syllabus was restricted to conform with 'conservative Islamic teaching', with lessons in sex education banned and evolution only covered 'briefly'. Department for Education inspectors were ordered into Park View School and its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen, after a letter dubbed 'Trojan Horse' was uncovered apparently outlining a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools. Tahir Alam (left), head of the board of governors for the three schools, is accused of marginalising headteachers in an effort to introduce hardline Muslim teaching. Lindsey Clark, former headteacher of Park View (right), retired last week after being left with little control over her school . The unsigned and undated letter claimed that a small but radical group of Muslims was pursuing its own agenda in the classrooms, with uncooperative headteachers and governors forced out. In a document leaked to The Telegraph, inspectors found that in Park View school, girls were forced to sit around the back or edges of the classroom while boys were allowed to sit at the front. Officials from the school had previously claimed that any segregation was voluntary, but inspectors were told by students that teachers set out the seating plans. In some subjects there was even entirely separated teaching in separate rooms, the report says. At Golden Hillock five Christian students in Year 11 were 'left to teach themselves' religious education after the teacher gave all their time 'to the students who are doing the Islamic course'. All discussion of sexual orientation or intimacy was banned at the same school, limiting lessons on biology, the arts and literature. Pupils at two of the schools said the theory of evolution was only covered 'briefly' in biology, while lessons on the body structure and menstrual cycle were banned as 'Muslims are not allowed to study matters such as reproduction with the opposite sex.' A report by inspectors sent into Park View School to probe allegations that hardline Islamic views are being taught in classrooms reveals forced segregation between male and female pupils, a ban on sex education in some classes and discrimination against Christian pupils . Despite these restrictions, Arabic lessons were compulsory for all students. Pupils were also encouraged to begin and end lessons with  prayer, and loudspeakers were used to broadcast calls to prayer. Headteachers at the schools were marginalised, according to the report, with all three schools in reality being run by Tahir Alam, who ran the board of governors. Inspectors say close relatives of the school management were appointed without proper background checks and that, in some schools, the headteachers were unaware of the names of some of the most senior staff. Park View headteacher Lindsey Clark resigned last month after being reduced to a figurehead with no real control over her school. The report also contains allegations that school governors were rude or dismissive towards female staff, who were excluded from important meetings. In some cases, male governors even refused to shake their female colleagues' hands. Speaking to MailOnline, a Department for Education spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on leaked documents. 'The allegations made in relation to some schools in Birmingham are very serious and we are investigating all evidence put to us in conjunction with Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and the police. 'It is absolutely vital these investigations are carried out impartially, without pre-judgment. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.' A spokesman for Park View school was unavailable for comment.","Department for Education investigating three Birmingham schools .

'It . is only logical for President Xi to meet her, because it is a matter of . etiquette for the head of the household to meet the guest of his wife,' said Teng Jianqun, director of the American studies department at China . Institute of International Studies. Expert timing: Mrs Obama is the picture of concentration as she returns another serve . He . said Mrs Obama likely served as a messenger on behalf of President . Barack Obama - adding: 'She made history as the first U.S. First Lady to . visit China independently.' Earlier in the day, Mrs Obama had toured a Beijing high school and former Imperial Palace. She had also greeted . students who were building robots and tried her hand at Chinese . calligraphy at the Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal . University in central Beijing. The elite school has 33 American exchange . students, and some of its Chinese students aspire to study in the . U.S. In a calligraphy class set up for . Mrs Obama's visit, the First Lady practiced writing the Chinese . character for 'eternal' under the guidance of 16-year-old student Lu . Yuhong. 'I'm nervous,' Mrs. Obama said - to which, Mrs Peng replied in English: 'Don't be nervous'. Cultural exchange: Mrs Obama dips a calligraphy brush into ink as she takes a lesson in writing Mandarin . The First Lady was assisted by Peng Liyuan, left, the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, and 16-year-old high school pupil Lu Yuhong, right, who showed her how to write the Chinese character meaning 'eternity' Speaking . after the class, Lu also said he had been nervous, as well as 'very . excited' - adding: 'But the First Lady was so amicable. She was very . approachable.' Among six American exchange students who attended the calligraphy class was Audrey Fritz, 17, who had come from the exclusive . Sidwell Friends School in Washington. 'It's been an amazing experience,' Fritz said of her time in China. 'I have learned to be much more independent.' In . another class, students showed Mrs Obama small robots they had built - . moving the devices with remote controls over piles of yellow plastic . bricks. 'All the . students that she met with, the Chinese students, spoke English and were . able to explain to her in very fluent English what they were doing,' said Tina Tchen, Mrs. Obama's chief of staff. Power wives: The visit marks the first meeting between Mrs Obama and Ms Peng, whose husbands run the world's first and second largest economies respectively . Ms Peng watches as Mrs Obama tries out a remote control mechanical robot made by Beijing Normal pupils . 'And . I think she found that very impressive, because we know it's something . that we struggle with in the United States, about having our kids be . able to be fluent in a second language by the time they get to high . school.' Later in the morning, Mrs Peng went with Mrs. Obama to the former Imperial Palace in central Beijing, before attending a private dinner and a performance. Tomorrow, . the First Lady is due to speak at Peking University, where she is believed to be speaking on the importance of free exchange of ideas, before visiting the Great Wall on Sunday. 'I . do think tomorrow she will talk about the value of the free exchange of . ideas and the Internet, and how that, in her view, has made our country . stronger; how even when you can be the object of criticism, as she and . her husband have been, that that's not a system that she would change,' Tchen said. Holiday snaps: Mrs Obama, her daughters and her mother, Marian Robinson, pose with Ms Peng outside at the Forbidden City, the former palace of the Chinese imperial families for more than 500 years, in Beijing . Ms Peng shows Mrs Obama the sights of the vast palace complex, which consists of nearly a thousand buildings . Sightseeing: The visit to the Forbidden City was to be followed by a private dinner and a performance . Mrs Obama's . tour comes as the U.S. tries to build diplomatic relations with China, . which is set to overtake the American superpower as the world's largest . economy within 15 years. The visit has been seen as a . prelude to an upcoming meeting between President Xi and Obama at a nuclear . security summit in The Hague, when a number of thorny issues will be raised.

"The world’s largest offshore wind farm has been given the go-ahead to be built in British waters. Energy Secretary Ed Davey has granted planning permission for the ambitious scheme – which could cost bill payers more than £10.5billion in green subsidies. The plan is for 400 turbines to be erected in a giant grid structure 80 miles off the Yorkshire coast, covering 430sq miles in the area known as Dogger Bank. Growth: The new windfarm off the Yorkshire coast would dwarf this one, Walney, off Cumbria . The plan is for 400 turbines to be erected in a giant grid structure 80 miles off the Yorkshire coast, covering 430sq miles in the area known as Dogger Bank . The Creyke Beck wind farms would be more than twice the size of the London Array, currently the world’s biggest offshore wind farm. The turbines are expected to power 1.8million homes – about 2.5 per cent of Britain’s entire electricity requirement. The building costs of the project are estimated at up to £8billion, which will be paid by Forewind, an international consortium of energy companies SSE, RWE, Statkraft and Statoil. But if the plan is approved for inclusion in the Government’s subsidy scheme, Contracts for Difference, the firms could expect to make their money back within a decade because it would guarantee them a fixed price for the electricity they produce. The decision on inclusion in the Contracts for Difference will be made by 2017 by whoever is Energy Secretary at the time, and then Forewind will decide whether to begin construction or not. If the consortium is granted access to the programme, which is funded through a green subsidy on energy bills, it can expect to receive an estimated £700million a year – or £10.5billion over the 15 years of guaranteed funding. Dr John Constable, director of Renewable Energy Foundation, which calculated the figures, said the size of the project is so big that it could alter the shape of the British economy. He said: ‘The Creyke Beck offshore wind farm would receive about £700million a year, and all drawn from consumer bills. 'Additional energy costs on this scale will affect the course of British economic history, and not for the better. The last time public subsidies on this scale were directed towards a single industry it was called British Leyland. Arguably, not a good omen.’ And the scheme could still grow even bigger, with a decision on a second project, Dogger Bank Teesside, expected in August. Tarald Gjerde, general manager of Forewind, claimed that Creyke Beck could create up to 4,750 jobs over its 25-year lifespan. Liberal Democrat Mr Davey said: ‘Making the most of Britain’s homegrown energy is creating jobs and businesses in the UK, getting the best deal for consumers and reducing our reliance on foreign imports. Wind power is vital to this plan, with £14.5billion invested since 2010 into an industry which supports 35,400 jobs.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey (pictured) has granted planning permission for the ambitious scheme – which could cost bill payers more than £10.5billion in green subsidies . The Government is keen to expand the number of offshore wind farms because they do not attract the same local opposition as onshore projects. However, the offshore alternatives come at a price. Every wind turbine built at sea costs bill payers an extra £300,000 a year in public subsidies, according to the Royal Academy of Engineering. The Committee on Climate Change has estimated that green subsidies made up £45 of the average £1,140 dual gas and electricity bill in 2013. This will rise to £100 by 2020, and £175 by 2030, by which time the total average bill will be £1,305. There are 1,200 offshore wind turbines in British waters today. The Government wants 3,000 by 2020. A Department of Energy spokesman said: said: ‘Any estimates about possible Government support for Dogger Bank are pure baseless speculation. The cost of offshore wind is already coming down rapidly; and we are introducing auctions for Government support to drive the costs down even further.’","Energy Secretary Ed Davey granted planning permission for the scheme .

"Safe: Ambassador Martin Harris was not harmed in the terror scare at the British Embassy in Romania . British Embassy staff in Romania were targeted by a suspected al-Qaeda terrorist brandishing a sword.

"Worthless: Rachel Sawford, 29, says Jobcentre staff made her 2:1 in Social Work seem 'worthless' A mother who escaped an abusive relationship to get a degree was told to remove it from her CV by Jobcentre staff to avoid 'scaring off' employers. Rachel Sawford, 29, proudly told the careers advisor about her 2:1 in social work as she asked for help finding a job. But she was advised to leave her qualification off applications because it would hamper her chances of getting work. Ms Sawford, from Portsmouth, has blasted the advice, which 'made my degree seem like nothing'. She said: 'They are saying everything I have achieved in the past four years is worthless. 'I have worked since I was 16 and this is the first time I have been on benefits. 'I want to get off benefits but I will not take my achievement off my CV.' The mother-of-one, who graduated from the University of Portsmouth in July this year, hoped to use her qualification to help other vulnerable women in violent relationships. But straight out of education, she struggled to find work and was forced to sign-on for Jobseeker’s Allowance later that month. To her dismay, the staff informed her she would be 'more employable' for the jobs they had to offer if she hid her BSc (Hons) from would-be employers. However, the graduate - who now has a £30,000 student loan to pay off - refuses to do so. She said: 'I knew it would be difficult for a single mum to find a job, so I went to the Jobcentre to get advice, which is what I thought they are there to do. 'The contract you sign says after 13 weeks you will have to look for jobs outside of your remit. 'When they were building the contract on the computer, they asked if I had my CV, so I gave it to her. 'She said ‘this is lovely but you will have to amend it’ because I would be overqualified for some jobs. Advice: An advisor at Arundel Street Jobcentre said, 'that's lovely but you're over-qualified' 'She said I would scare employers with my degree. I was shocked. 'I said I was not happy with that advice because I had worked really hard for four years to achieve it. 'If I did not want to get a job in this area, I would not have gone to university.' Ms Sawford, who has a six-year-old daughter, said if she couldn't find a job as a social worker she wants to do support work or youth projects. But, currently on a four-week placement as a substitute teaching assistant but, she is still struggling to find employment for when her placement finishes. Her case follows a study by the Office for National Statistics showing half of recent graduates are in jobs they do not need a degree to do. Liz Holford, a careers advisor at the University of Portsmouth, said: 'If people’s circumstances mean they can’t move, it is about seeing what other roles she could consider. 'A lot of social work jobs say you need experience, but graduates do manage to find employment. 'I have heard other students say employers only want people with experience but there are a lot of jobs for new graduates, too.' Among graduates who left university in the last five years, almost half are in jobs which don't need a degree . A spokesman from the Department for Work and Pensions spokesman did not deny staff tell jobseekers to omit the fact they are a graduate. He added: 'Jobcentre Plus advisors work with jobseekers to ensure they have the best chance possible of moving into work. 'This may include helping someone to highlight relevant skills, experience, and qualifications to ensure their CV is focused towards the job they are applying for.' Almost 40 per cent of people over the age of 21 are now graduates, compared with 17 per cent in 1992. The Office for National Statistics say non-graduates experienced the highest unemployment rise during the recession. But some are are still finding it hard to get a job to match the skills they are qualified in. Many cannot find work at all. The University of Portsmouth said 93 per cent of social work graduates from its course were in employment six months after graduating. The research does not show, however, if these are graduate jobs.","Rachel Sawford, 29, escaped an abusive relationship to get a degree .

"The 13-year-old Florida girl who is accused of plotting with her boyfriend on Facebook to kill her mother will stand trial as an adult. Yaquelin Galvex Don has been charged with attempted murder after she lured her mother, Luz Galvez into their garage where her 15-year-old boyfriend, Pedro Solis was waiting to slit her throat. However, Galvez did not die after the March 9 attack and in an incredible twist Solis was convinced to rush her to the hospital where he dumped on the curb and then drove off. Charged: Yaquelin Galvez Don was charged with principal to attempted premeditated first-degree murder along with her boyfriend Pedro Solis (right) Galvez received emergency surgery that day on the wound to her neck and was able to communicate to police the same day that her daughter and her boyfriend were responsible. The teens had plotted through Facebook messages to kill the girl's parents for more than a week, investigators said because Don's parent's disapproved of their relationship. Deputies said that Don tricked her mother into coming to the garage with her where she was met by Solis. According to the arrest report, Solis confronted Galvez and demanded that they be allowed to stay together at which point he attacked her. Crime scene: Deputies said the the girl lured her mother, Luz Galvez, into her Ocala garage on Northwest 55th Place, and then Pedro Solis slit her throat on March 9 . Galvez's husband is wheelchair bound and was not able to intervene and Solis is also accused of threatening his throat with the knife. However, he convinced the teen to drive his wife to hospital where she is recovering now. 'Part of what the young man offered in the conversation with the victim is they should be together and to let the 13-year-old and 15-year-old have a romance. But the mom didn't think they should be involved, and quite frankly they retaliated,' said Marion County Sheriff's Office spokesman Judge Cochran. Don, 13, has been denied bail and The Department of Children and Families is providing care for the 13-year-old's father, Jorge Don-Brianes, who is wheelchair-bound and was also allegedly threatened. During her first court appearance Saturday, the Ocala Star-Banner reports a judge ordered the girl to be held without bond. The judge said the girl, who wore shackles and a red jumpsuit, faces life in prison if convicted. Stunning reversal: Authorities said Solis took Galvez to the hospital after she told him he could be with her daughter and that she would not sue him . 'When someone is at that age, you have to evaluate the case differently,' said the girl's attorney, Tania Alavi, who expressed disappointment in the decision. Solis was indicted on March 18 on the same charges and was also denied bond. His mother, Maria Hernandez, said she urged her 15-year-old son to break off a relationship because she was too young, but he ignored her. She described Solis as a good boy who loved Don and frequently talked on the phone with her like any normal teenage couple. Hernandez said her son was suspended from school last fall after getting caught with a small amount of marijuana and was sent to an alternative school.","Yaquelin Galvex Don, 13, is to be tried as an adult for her alleged role in a conspiracy to kill her mother that authorities say she planned with her teenage boyfriend on Facebook .

"Dead: Sex offender Charles Mozdir, 32, had been on the run for two years prior to being shot dead following a dramatic shoot-out in New York City on Monday afternoon . The girlfriend of a fugitive pedophile was allegedly the one who reported him to police Monday - a move that left him dead and the law enforcement officers wounded following a violent shoot out. Charles Mozdir, 32, had been on the lam since 2012, but thanks to the tip, authorities tracked him to a Greenwich Village smoke shop, sources told The New York Post. The newspaper reports that the woman didn't know of Mozdir's past until she saw a segment about him on John Walsh's TV show 'The Hunt' on Sunday night and was so disgusted she decided to give him up. She called authorities, and gave them his cellphone number, the sources said. Detectives used GPS to narrow his location to the West Fourth Street shop, and then a New York-New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force member spotted him Monday afternoon. The sex offender who had been on the run for two years after skipping bail for molesting two boys under the age of seven in California was shot and killed in the dramatic shoot-out with federal marshals and police. Mozdir's case had featured on CNN's 'The Hunt' last week. It detailed how he had been the target of a nationwide manhunt after a family friend accused him of molesting her son while the child lay sick in bed in Coronado, California, in June 2012. It was the second child molestation case against him, investigators said. Child porn and bestiality videos were also allegedly found in his home. But instead of facing charges he fled. His car was found abandoned in Darien, Georgia, later that June. It turned out he had been hiding in Key West, Florida, and just months ago moved to Manhattan. An injured U.S. Marshall sits on the sidewalk outside a West Village, NYC smoke shop after being shot on Monday by pedophile Charles Mozdir . Mozdir is seen being carried out of the shop on a stretcher on Monday after he pulled a gun on officers. He died in hospital . Cops: Heavily armed police investigate the shooting, which left Charles Mozdir dead and one of the officers shot three times. That officer, Mario Muniz, was celebrated Tuesday by both his mother and the relieved mother of the then 7-year-old boy Mozdir molested . The shooting happened just after 1pm . in the West Village, not far from New York University, when a fugitive . apprehension task force tried to serve a warrant at a shop called . Smoking Culture NYC. The . store sells items including bongs, cigarettes and cigars and it is . believed that Mozdir was behind the counter and working when the . authorities showed up. Two . U.S. Marshals and an NYPD detective were wounded in the shooting. The . officers were part of the special task force investigating Mozdir. They . entered the shop to serve him with a warrant when he pulled a revolver . on them. He also had 20 spare rounds of ammunition in his pockets. Sources say one of the marshals was shot in the leg and the NYPD detective was shot three times. Emergency workers transported all four victims to Bellevue Hospital, where the suspect died. One of the marshals was shot in the leg and the NYPD detective - named as NYPD Detective Mario Muniz, 45, - was shot three times. The detective has 20 years service with the NYPD and had recently been promoted, Bratton said. Mayor Bill De Blasio said on Monday that the officers were recovering and 'in good spirits'. He added that the detective's life had been saved by his bullet-proof vest. Jerry DeWitt, who lives on the West Village street where the shooting took place, arrived minutes after the shoot-out and described the scene as 'pure chaos'.

Onlookers: People look on at the crime scene where two U.S. Marshals and one NYPD detective tried to apprehend a suspect who was shot and killed . 'You expect anything to happen here but not this,' he told MailOnline. Another . resident, Christine Rucci, who lives opposite the shop, told MailOnline . that at first she heard a loud noise and when she looked out her front . window she noticed the shop was surrounded by a number of unmarked cars . and there was a helicopter overhead. She . estimated that there are four elementary schools nearby. 'What is . really upsetting is that he was a sex offender and that he had a gun,' she told MailOnline. Ms Rucci, who has lived in the area for 25 years said it used to feel very safe - especially when Michael Bloomberg's daughter lived in the same building - but that there had also been a shooting on Mother's Day on the same street. A $1 million bench warrant was issued for Mozdir's arrest on June 15, 2012, after he skipped an arraignment in San Diego Superior Court on child sexual assault charges, according to Steve Walker, a spokesman for the San Diego County district attorney. He had posted $250,000 bail. Mozdir had been wanted on five counts of lewd acts upon a child younger than 14 and a charge of attempting to keep a witness from prosecuting a crime, according to the criminal complaint. It is believed that Mozdir (pictured left) was working behind the counter of Smoking Culture NYC (right) when the fugitive apprehension task force showed up and he pulled his gun on them . Media: The media set up at the scene of the shooting . The one-time wedding photographer has . been accused by a family friend of molesting her seven-year-old son . while babysitting him in Coronado, near . San Diego. After he . disappeared, investigators had found sickening images of child . pornography and bestiality on his cell phone and computers at his home. He was considered armed and dangerous . since a roommate told police that Mozdir, armed with two guns, . threatened to kill himself and a victim's father. Law enforcement had hunted him from California to Mexico to the deep south and finally to New York City. According to CNN, after the episode of The Hunt featuring Mozdir aired . authorities received a tip that he was working at a restaurant in . Manhattan, but the information didn't pan out. After CNN . re-aired Mozdir's episode on Sunday night, another tip came in that . resulted in an address for Mozdir, according to John Walsh. Mayor Bill de Blasio says the three are . stable and that, 'We pray everything we are hearing is true and that . these officers will be OK in the long run.' Smoke shop: The shooting happened just after 1 p.m. in the West Village not far from New York University when a fugitive apprehension task force tried to serve a warrant outside a smoke shop just north of a busy subway station . Scene: A cop and two US marshalls were shot Monday in the West Village . Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said the fugitive task force seeks absconders from other states. Coronado police said in a statement: . ‘Our thoughts and prayers go out to the brave officers assigned to the . U.S. Marshall’s fugitive task force who were wounded in a shootout with . suspected child molester Charles Mozdir in New York this morning. 'Mozdir . was wanted in a 2012 child molest case in Coronado. He failed to appear . in court on the charges and a $1 million warrant was issued.’ Mozdir allegedly molested a young boy . whose parents were friends of his while he served as a babysitter in . June 2012, reported CNN in The Hunt. He molested the boy while his mother slept in bed next to him, his father told CNN. Child pornography was recovered at Mozdir's home, U.S. Marshals Service deputy Brian Grimes told CNN. Mozdir was later arrested and made bail, he then skipped an arraignment and went on the run. Mozdir allegedly molested a second boy in a similar incident, the channel said. Mozdir's scent was found by a hound on a highway and his car was recovered in Georgia, but investigators were unable to find the alleged child molester, CNN said. In 2013 , authorities said ‘Mozdir made threats to take his own life and threats have been made to the victim’s family.’ The violence recalls a deadly shootout that left a gunman and two auxiliary New York City police officers dead on another Greenwich Village street in March 2007. That gunman, David Garvin, killed a bartender, according to police, and then turned crowded streets packed with storied taverns into a shooting gallery. Unarmed volunteer officers Eugene Marshalik and Nicholas Todd Pekearo were killed.

"Renowned British neurologist Oliver Sacks says he wants to live life to the full after revealing that he has terminal liver cancer. Writing about his illness in a poignant and inspiring article, Professor Sacks, who made his name treating patients with rare conditions, said: ‘It is up to me now to choose how to live out the months that remain to me. I have to live in the richest, deepest, most productive way I can.’ Professor Sacks, who was awarded a CBE in 2008, said his ‘predominant feeling is one of gratitude’ for the life he has lived. British neurologist and best-selling author Oliver Sacks (pictured above in 2008) revealed that he has been diagnosed with terminal cancer . Sacks's 1973 Awakenings detailed his real-life experience with patients who suffered from a condition known as encephalitis lethargica, and was adapted into a 1990 film (scenes from the film above) of the same name starring Robin Williams (right) and Robert De Niro (left) Awakenings explores how patients lived with the condition and how they were able to exit, however briefly, from their catatonic states with the aid of a drug (above Williams, left, and De Niro, right, in scenes from the film) The 81-year-old added: ‘This does not mean I am finished with life. ‘On the contrary, I feel intensely alive, and I want and hope in the time that remains to deepen my friendships, to say farewell to those I love, to write more, to travel if I have the strength, to achieve new levels of understanding and insight. ‘I feel a sudden clear focus and perspective. There is no time for anything inessential.’ The London-born academic, who is now a professor of neurology at New York University School of Medicine, was diagnosed with cancer nine years ago. A rare eye tumour was removed, leaving him blind in that eye, but the cancer has now spread. The professor said it was very rare for such tumours to do so and that he was ‘among the unlucky 2 per cent’. He wrote in the New York Times: ‘A month ago, I felt that I was in good health, even robust health. ‘At 81, I still swim a mile a day. But my luck has run out – a few weeks ago I learned that I have multiple metastases [tumours] in the liver.’ He went on: ‘I feel grateful that I have been granted nine years of good health and productivity since the original diagnosis, but now I am face to face with dying. ‘The cancer occupies a third of my liver, and though its advance may be slowed, this particular sort of cancer cannot be halted.’ He added: ‘I cannot pretend I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one of gratitude. I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and I have given something in return; I have read and travelled and thought and written. The 81-year-old (above left in 2010 and right with director Peter Brook in 2013) wrote about his condition in an essay in the New York Times' Opinion section today. He wrote that he recently learned he was among the 'unlucky two percent' in whom a rare kind of melanoma had spread . Sacks (above pictured outside his childhood home) said that he feels intensely alive and that he wants to deepen his friendships, say farewell to those he loves, to write and travel, and attain new levels of understanding and insight during the time he has left . ‘I have had an intercourse with the world, the special intercourse of writers and readers. ‘Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure.’ Professor Sacks studied at Oxford before moving to America to continue his medical studies. He has never married and describes himself as celibate. At New York University School of Medicine he became known for his expertise on chronic sleeping sickness, resulting in his breakthrough 1973 book, Awakenings. The book, about patients who were treated with a drug that woke them up after years in a catatonic state, inspired the 1990 Oscar-nominated film of the same name, starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. He has written several other acclaimed books about unusual medical conditions, including The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat, which tells the story of patients with visual agnosia – a rare neurological disorder that makes them unable to recognise familiar objects. In addition to Awakenings, some of Sacks's other books have delved into topics including deafness, colorblindness and hallucinations. He also wrote the critically acclaimed The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, which explored case histories of a variety of unusual neurologic conditions .","Oliver Sacks, 81, had his memoir adapted into a 1990 film  starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro .

"Shark attack:  Adam Strange was attacked at Muriwai Beach on Aucklands west coast of New Zealand . Police fired 20 shots at a great white shark as they tried desperately to save a father killed while swimming off a beach yesterday. Adam Strange, 46, an award-winning film and TV director, waved and called for help as the shark dragged him underwater only 200 yards from hundreds of beachgoers. Police and lifeguards launched a frantic rescue effort as about four other sharks joined in the attack off Muriwai Beach, north of Auckland, at around 1.30pm. The father of one lived locally and was known to the traumatised young lifeguards who joined the fight to save him. Pio Mose was in a group fishing on rocks near the beach when he saw a ‘huge’ shark attack the lone swimmer 50 yards from where he was standing. ‘All of a sudden we saw the shark fin and next minute, boom, attack him and then blood everywhere on the water,’ said Mr Mose. He said the man appeared to struggle with the shark before it swam away – and then it, and  others, came back. Mr Mose called the police on his mobile while a friend ran for help. He said: ‘He was still alive. He put his head up. We called him to swim over the rock to where we were. ‘He raised his hand up and then while he was raising his hand we saw another attack pull him in.’ Mr Mose said that as blood filled the water, three or four more sharks arrived. The fishermen were forced to watch as the shark carried the man’s body out to sea. ‘It’s awful – like a nightmare. I was shaking, scared, panicked.’ Scroll down for video .

"Top clubs across Europe are keeping an eye on Shakhtar Donetsk's Brazilian stars after six of them refused to return to Ukraine for the new season. The six include two of Shakhtar's . key midfielders, Alex Teixeira and Douglas Costa, as well as . Argentinian striker Facundo Ferreyra. Costa, 23, is a long-term target of Manchester United. The players remained in France following a friendly against Lyon on Saturday, as fighting continues in the city of Donetsk. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Shakhtar's Bernard score and get sent off for removing shirt . Star man: Douglas Costa has often been linked with moves to top clubs and could leave Ukraine . Creative spark: Bernard was a member of the Brazil World Cup squad and was an Arsenal target last summer . Meanwhile, . Brazil winger Bernard, Shakhtar's most high-profile player who chose a . move to Ukraine over a transfer to Arsenal last summer, is yet to rejoin . the squad after his World Cup exploits in his native country. It is not yet known whether the 21-year-old will join his compatriots in their refusal to return to the war-torn country. Shakhtar's owner says the six players will be punished financially if they fail to return. 'If they . don't come then in the first instance they will suffer,' the club's . billionaire owner Rinat Akhmetov said in a statement on the Shakhtar . website. No return: Alex Teixera, who stared against Manchester United last season, is among those to stay in Europe . A fine mess: Shakhtar owner Rinat Akhmetov has threatened financial punishments if the players stay away . Refusing to fulfil their contracts could cost the players 'tens of millions of euros' in compensation payments to the club, he warned. 'I don't rule out that these players will return to the club soon,' Akhmetov said, adding that several of them could arrive Monday and that the club would not seek to sell them. The Ukrainian military is attempting to retake the city of Donetsk in the east of the country, which is controlled by pro-Russian rebels. Akhmetov is Ukraine's richest man and a leading power-broker in the east of the country, where his companies employ hundreds of thousands of people. Samba stars: Shakhtar have a reputation for buying and selling Brazilians, including Willian and Fernandinho . He has publicly opposed the rebels and earlier this month pleaded with Ukrainian forces not to bomb Donetsk. The Ukrainian Football Federation has yet to rule where Shakhtar will play their home games while the conflict rages. Akhmetov has expressed a preference for the mostly Russian-speaking city of Kharkiv in the north-east. 'We aren't going to take risks and in no way will we take players to somewhere that is dangerous,' Akhmetov said. Future worries: Shakhtar are due to play Champions League football again next season . Argentinian striker Sebastian Blanco has also refused to return to his Ukrainian club, Metalist Kharkiv, ahead of the new season, local media report. Shakhtar's first game of the season is the Ukrainian Super Cup against Dynamo Kiev, which will be played in the western city of Lviv.

The actor, a noted political activist, is planning the move after he weds Briton Amal Alamuddin in September . Clooney once famously declared he could never run for public office because he’d ‘slept with too many women, done too many drugs and been to too many parties’. He has often played politicians in his career - including the character of Governor Mike Morris in 2011 film The Ides of March. 'George is hugely popular with the Democrats and where better a place to put him than as the Governor of California the home of Hollywood,' a friend told the Sunday Mirror.

'She is as far removed as some of the girls he has previously dated and possesses incredible intelligence that bodes well if she ever does become First Lady.' It was confirmed that the couple were engaged earlier this month following an eight-month romance and are said to be hoping to host their upcoming nuptials in the Italian city in September, exactly one year to the day after they met. Ronald Reagan was voted in to the White House after becoming governor of the Golden State and if Clooney . was successful in gaining victory in California it would put him on . course to follow his lead.

Clooney was the President’s guest for a screening of his latest movie, The Monuments Men, at the White House. where he was accompanied by his fiancee. In April Clooneys confessed to calling Las Vegas gambling mogul Steve Wynn an . 'a**hole' and storming off at a dinner because the casino-owner . insulted President Barack Obama. The . verbal assault occurred when the two-time Oscar winner . was in Vegas promoting his Casamigos tequila, and was invited to dine . with Wynn and his wife, Andrea Hissom, at the fancy Botero restaurant . inside the 72-year-old's Encore hotel. But when dinner was finished, the conversation turned to Obama's Affordable Care Act, of which Wynn is a vocal opponent. Clooney immediately took exception to how the billionaire chairman and CEO spoke of his 'longtime friend.' He allegedly declared that he didn't have to listen to 'this f***ing stuff' before exiting to another bar. In May 2012 Clooney proved his loyalty to Obama by hosting a £15million fundraiser for the re-election cause - on his personal basketball court. Guests (mostly movie stars) paid a whopping £25,000 ($40,000) each for a place at the 14 hallowed tables, and gave the president a rapturous welcome.

Discussing their friendship in an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Obama said Clooney is low-maintenance and keeps his distance so that Obama won't be criticised for hanging out with Hollywood celebrities. First Lady Michelle said of Clooney: 'He's cute, too' and joked that there was a 'conspiracy' to prevent her from spending too much time with Clooney. She said that whenever the star meets her husband it is always when she is away. Mr Obama said that whenever 'Gorgeous George' visits the White House his staff 'mysteriously' congregate around his office. He added: 'I will say that the couple of times he's come to the White House, I notice that the staff suddenly is circling around my office. They've got memos they need to make sure I see right away.' The President said the pair became friends after Clooney discussed with him his support of the oppressed people of Darfur and Sudan. 'And so when I was a senator -- this was well before I was president -- that was an issue that I was working together on a bipartisan basis, and George, who had traveled there, done documentaries there, and was very well-informed, came to testify in Congress,' Mr Obama added.

The actor said at the time: 'It's actually a humiliating thing to be arrested no matter what you do, but I'm glad to be standing here with my father.' The protestors were accusing Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, of provoking a humanitarian crisis and blocking food and aid from entering the Nuba Mountains in the county's border region with South Sudan. Clooney, whose father was a political journalist, has described himself as a liberal. He told CNN journalist Larry King: 'I'm a liberal. I'm confused when that became a bad word.

"A woman who wrote in her journal that it was 'ahmazing' to kill her nine-year-old neighbor when she was 15 has asked a judge to overturn her guilty plea. Alyssa Bustamante, now 19, appeared in court in Jefferson County, Missouri on Thursday and she only pleaded guilty to killing Elizabeth Olten in 2009 because she had been threatened with a life in prison without parole. After admitting to authorities that she strangled and stabbed her neighbor because she wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone, she was charged as an adult with . first-degree murder, which carries a mandatory prison sentence of life . without the possibility of parole. But in January 2012, just before she was to go to . trial, Bustamante pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of . second-degree murder and was sentenced to life with a chance of parole. Killer: Alyssa Bustamante, 19, pictured in court on Thursday, says she only pleaded guilty to killing her neighbor because she faced the possibility of life without parole, and wanted to reduce the sentence . 'I couldn't wrap my mind around it. It was just hopelessness,' Bustamante said in court on Thursday. Bustamante, who appeared in court wearing an orange prison suit and shackled, added that she didn't understand many of the legal issues her attorneys talked about. Her grandmother, who raised her, sat on a courtroom bench a couple of rows behind her. Elizabeth's mother, Patty Preiss, sat on . the opposite side of the courtroom, wearing a sweatshirt with her . daughter's smiling photo inside of a heart and the words: 'Always Loved, . Never Forgotten.' In 2012, she also pleaded guilty to armed criminal action for using a knife in the . killing and was handed an additional 30-year sentence to run after her . life sentence. But five months after Bustamante . pleaded guilty, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a separate case that . juveniles cannot face automatic life sentences without the possibility . of parole. Bustamante's new attorney is citing that ruling as a reason to reverse her guilty plea. 'The . threat of (life without parole) as a mandatory sentence was allowed to . intimidate Alyssa into accepting a guilty plea she would not have . otherwise accepted,' Gary Brotherton wrote in . court documents. In court: Alyssa Bustamante (left) appeared with her attorney Gary Brotherton in court on Thursday for a hearing on whether to set aside her plea in the 2009 slaying of 9-year-old Elizabeth Olten . In cuffs: Bustamante is pictured at the witness stand for her hearing in Jefferson City, Missouri on Thursday . Bustamante was just 15 at the time she . strangled and slashed the nine-year-old girl to death, saying she . wanted to know what it was like to kill someone. Prosecutors . said Bustamante plotted Elizabeth's death, even digging two holes to be . used as graves, then attended school for about a week while waiting for . the right time to kill. The girl had been playing with . Bustamante's younger half-sister, aged six, when the older girl led her . into the woods, saying she had a surprise for her. Bustamante told the court that she used a knife to cut Elizabeth's throat and then strangled the girl with her hands. Hundreds of volunteers searched for two days for Elizabeth before her body was found. At a November 2009 hearing, Missouri . State Highway Patrol Sgt. David Rice testified that she led authorities . to Elizabeth's body. Rice said Bustamante said 'she wanted to know what . it felt like' to kill. Victim: Elizabeth Olten was lured to the woods and strangled and stabbed in 2009. Bustamante, right, led police to her body after a days-long search and was arrested for first-degree murder . On the night of the killing, she wrote in her diary that it had been 'ahmazing'. 'I . just f***ing killed someone,' she wrote in the entry, which was read . aloud in court. 'I strangled them and slit their throat and stabbed them . now they're dead. I don't know how to feel atm [at the moment]. 'It . was ahmazing. As soon as you get over the ""ohmygawd I can't do this"" feeling, it's pretty enjoyable. I'm kinda nervous and shaky though right . now. Kay, I gotta go to church now...lol.' Following the latest revelations that . Bustamante wants the plea overturned, prosecutor Mark Richardson said . the claims 'do not have any merit' and her original sentence should . stand. 'Generally, they're . very big long shots to try to prove that somehow some bad advice caused a . person to plead guilty when they otherwise wouldn't have,' Richardson . said in an interview. Bustamante's . attorney claims her due process rights were violated because the . initial first-degree murder charge would have led to an . unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. Eerie: Bustamante, who shared these disturbing images of herself online, called the killing 'ahmazing' He added in court documents that her actual sentence is also unconstitutional because 'it does not provide her with any realistic opportunity for release'. When she was sentenced, the Missouri Department of Corrections said Bustamante would have to serve 35 years and five months before she is eligible for parole. She's in prison in eastern Missouri. Brotherton's court filing also argues that Bustamante's original attorneys provided ineffective advice. It says they pressured her during a more than half hour jailhouse visit to make a quick decision to plead guilty to second-degree murder without explaining that the pending Supreme Court case could have affected her punishment. 'They said I could go think about it, but the urgency they expressed made me feel like I couldn't,' she said in court on Thursday. Juvenile justice officials testified that . Bustamante had attempted to commit suicide in 2007 and had been . receiving mental health treatment for depression and cutting herself.","Alyssa Bustamante strangled and stabbed Elizabeth Olten in Missouri in 2009 because she wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone .

"Manchester City are facing a £49million fine from UEFA and savage Champions League sanctions that could keep up to four of their stars out of Europe next season. City were fighting their punishment for breaching UEFA’s financial fair play regulations on Tuesday night. They are understood to have until the end of the week to accept the ‘settlement’ from UEFA or their case will be passed to a panel which has the ultimate power to kick them out of the Champions League. The situation is embarrassing for . Shock: Manchester City are to be hit with a £49million fine and a squad restriction for breaching FFP rules . Limitations: Manuel Pellegrini may not be able to put all his players in his European squad due to the salary cap . Goalkeepers: Joe Hart, Costel Pantilimon, Eirik Holmen Johansen. Defenders: Micah Richards, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, Joleon Lescott, Aleksandar Kolarov, Gael Clichy, Martin Demichelis, Matija Nastasic, Dedryck Boyata. Midfielders: James Milner, Samir Nasri, Javi García, Jesus Navas, Jack Rodwell, David Silva, Fernandinho, Yaya Toure. Forwards: Alvaro Negredo, Edin Dzeko, Sergio Aguero, Stevan Jovetic. Business as usual? Vincent Kompany signs eautographs outside the Etihad on Tuesday . City and their Abu Dhabi owners as Manuel Pellegrini’s side attempt to take a step closer to the Barclays Premier League title when they face Aston Villa at the Etihad tonight. The proposed fine is a significant sum even by the standards of Sheik Mansour but it is the Champions League sanctions that threaten to hit the club hardest. City face seeing their Champions League squad cut from 25 players to 21, as well as having a European salary cap imposed on them next season. While their ‘homegrown’ quota of eight players would remain the same, UEFA have proposed cutting their foreign contingent from 17 to 13. That could threaten the participation of some of the club’s big names and even have an impact on Pellegrini’s transfer plans for this summer. All five of his signings last summer were foreign, as are his main targets for next season. City might also have to reassess plans to let go of some of their homegrown players. Gareth Barry and Joleon Lescott are expected to leave at the end of their contracts, while Micah Richards, Jack Rodwell, Scott Sinclair, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata and John Guidetti face uncertain futures. City are one of nine teams being punished over FFP breaches. Club sources last night urged caution, saying reports of the sanctions are premature and speculative. UEFA president Michel Platini has said  in the past that teams will not  be kicked out of the Champions League, but the possibility remains if City fight the measures handed down. Pellegrini said: ‘When it is official news we can analyse what happens with the team. At the moment we don’t know what happens.’ It is understood Paris Saint- Germain are facing similar  sanctions to City, and their coach Laurent Blanc admitted that the measures would mean the club ‘won’t be able to do everything it wants’ in the Champions League next season. The issue cast a cloud over City’s preparations for tonight’s game, with City effectively needing four points from their remaining two games at home to Villa and West Ham to secure the club’s second title in three years. Pellegrini said: ‘We are not thinking about any draws. We are thinking about beating Aston Villa, then we’ll see about the next game.’ Sergio Aguero will miss the game after limping out of Saturday’s 3-2 win at Everton. The UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations, first agreed in principle in September 2009 by the Financial Control Panel of UEFA, were brought in to prevent professional football clubs spending more than they earn in the pursuit of success and in doing so getting into financial problems which might threaten their long-term survival. Introduced amid concern at the heavy spending of a number of professional clubs across Europe, it was hoped that the regulations would eventually lead to a more ‘level playing field’ by preventing clubs with very wealthy owners who make substantial cash gifts to their club from gaining an unfair advantage over other clubs who are run on a more sustainable business model, and in so doing encourage lower levels of spending. The financial fair play (FFP) regulations provide for sanctions to be taken against clubs who do not spend within a set budgetary framework over several seasons.

"The wind turbine built with £48,000 of taxpayers' money has been producing so little electricity it will take more than 400 years to repay the bill . A wind turbine built with £48,000 of taxpayers’ money has been producing so little electricity it will take more than 400 years to repay the bill, it emerged yesterday. Despite being in a windy, coastal town, the 60ft structure was built in a sheltered valley and managed to generate only an average of £5 worth of electricity a month. Now critics have branded the scheme  ‘an obscenely expensive vanity project’. The turbine was erected at the Aberystwyth offices of the Labour-controlled Welsh government in 2009 with the aim of reducing its carbon footprint. But . after years of scepticism – and in response to a freedom of information . application – the assembly finally admitted yesterday that the turbine . had generated just 33kWh of electricity a month. Officials blamed . mechanical problems, which meant the turbine had been able to work at . only quarter capacity until the start of this year. It is now operating at 68 per cent of capacity, but the electricity it generates still works out at less than £9 a month. At that rate it will take around 450 years for the cost of buying and installing the turbine to be recouped. The . company which supplied it, Quiet Revolution, denied mechanical problems . were to blame and said it had warned the Welsh government in advance . that the site was too sheltered. Experts . agreed that in a more-exposed spot in a coastal town  buffeted by . weather from Cardigan Bay, a turbine ought to be capable of generating . 20 times as much power. ‘The . problem is quite simple – it’s been put in the wrong place,’ turbine . installer Paul Burrell said. Turbines need unobstructed access to wind . from all directions. ‘Unfortunately the Welsh government’s one is . located in a valley two miles from the sea and has quite a short tower. ‘It’s next to tall buildings – so even if there’s a strong wind it will be displaced by the time it reaches the turbine.’ Jonathan . Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It would . seem that the turbine’s installation was nothing more than an obscenely . expensive vanity project.’ And . he pointed out: ‘If this project had been started when Elizabeth I was . on the throne, it would only be reaching break-even point now, 60 years . into the reign of Elizabeth II. Waste of money: This taxpayer-funded 60ft wind turbine has been producing just £5 of electricity a month - because it was put up in an area of Aberystwyth where there is very little wind . Last . night the Welsh government said the turbine was part of its ‘ambitious’ green programme which also featured a biomass heating system and solar . panels at its Aberystwyth offices. ‘As . a result, we have seen a 17 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions over . the past two years and are well on course to meet the overarching target . of a 30 per cent reduction by 2020.’ n A couple has won a legal ruling  that ten wind turbines be removed because they spoil the view from their home in France. In . a judgment with widespread implications for the rest of the EU, a court . in Pas-de-Calais agreed the 360ft-high structures ruined Erik and . Ingrid Wallecan’s quality of life. The . Wind Company, part of energy giant GDF Suez, was fined £31,500 and told . to remove the turbines within four months or face daily penalties of . £450.","60ft turbine built in area where there is no wind in Aberystwyth .

Friday: After being whipped over two legs by Legia Warsaw, Celtic get a Champions League reprieve after UEFA rule against the Polish club for fielding an 'ineligible' player who came on for the last few minutes of the second leg. Talk about the rub of the green. Back Heel . The FA made a big play this week of actually releasing figures to show that at least some of the money made from staging the Community Shield is pumped back into charity. So it should. After all, it used to be called the Charity Shield because when it was first set up in its current format of Champions versus Cup Winners way back in 1930, the majority of proceeds were meant to go straight to, well, charity. But in 2002 the Charity commission found that the Football Association had failed to meet its obligations under charity law. The commercialisation of the what was once hailed as the 'curtain raiser to the season' (that now happens on pre-season tours to the USA and Far East) began in 1974 when the game was first staged at Wembley, having previously been played at one of the competing club’s grounds. The match between Leeds and Liverpool remains etched in the history of football for three things . It was the last game Bill Shankly led Liverpool out before retiring. It was first proper game of Brian Clough’s ill-fated 44 day reign at Leeds. And it saw both Kevin Keegan and Billy Bremner sent off after a full scale scrap.

But after played resumed, Keegan and Bremner's tempers spilled over and they slugged it out -literally - stirring the crowd to cry out a familiar chant of the day: 'You're gonna get your f****** heads kicked in.' Tempers frayed: The scrap continues as referee Bob Matthewson loses control of the tie . Both were sent off and both left the pitch having taken off their shirts and thrown them to the grounds. Even if football was rougher back then the moral standards so were much higher. Because it was seen that both players had brought shame onto the English game on Wembley’s 'hallowed turf' Keegan and Bremner were suspended by the FA for ELEVEN games and fined the huge sum for the day of £500. For the record, the match ended with Liverpool winning on penalties. HIGHLIGHTS The infamous ill-tempered 1974 Charity Shield between Liverpool and Leeds . Stop Press . West Ham are set to battle Newcastle for Connor Wickham if they don't land Peter Crouch. With Andy Carroll out for the first months of the season The Hammers need to bolster their strike force. West Ham have offered Stoke £1million for 33-year-old Crouch. Stoke want £3m. If a compromise can't be reached then the Hammers will consider making a move for Wickham. Up and at 'em: West Ham will go after Sunderland striker Connor Wickham if Peter Crouch does not sign . Veteran: The Hammers are hoping to snap Crouch up at a cut-price £1million from Stoke City . The player has yet to agree a new contract with club and has been issued a 'sign or go' ultimatum by manager Gus Poyet. Wickham is available at a cut price £6 million given that his contract is running down. West Ham would probably need to offload one of their squad players to finance a move given their budget for transfers . Ironically Poyet could also be a target for the Hammers if the club eventually part company with Sam Allardyce . Libero . One of the arguments the FA offer to defend the ridiculous £100m-plus cost of the St George’s Park training facility is that at least it’s a great HQ to teach coaches. Yet more and more ex-pros and wannabe coaches are now opting to take their badges in Wales, under the Welsh FA, because the courses are far cheaper. Two of the most recent high profile ex-Premier League players to graduate there were former Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann and France World Cup winner Marcel Desailly. That is a great example of how cosmopolitan the English game now is - but clearly the FA are doing something wrong and as it stands the misguided St George’s Park project is not fit for purpose. BTW . It is now over two weeks since Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward left the club’s US tour to go and get some business done. As in secure the signings that manager Louis van Gaal wants to rebuild United’s 'broken squad'. Buying players is far from a perfect science, which is why United have an extensive wish list. All smiles: But Louis van Gaal hasn't been able to recruit all the new stars he wants for Manchester United . But progress has been slow. Woodward did a great bargaining job securing a world record kit deal with but he is not such an expert in the jungle that is the transfer market, as was proved last summer. One wonders how long it will be before there is friction between Van Gaal and Woodward if United don't get the players the Dutch coach wants - and soon.","German World Cup-winning centre half is valued at £25million .

"The Coalition was riven by bitter infighting over green taxes last night after David Cameron ordered a review to stem the rise in energy bills. Green taxes have been blamed for pushing energy prices to record levels, but the Prime Minister’s intervention met fierce opposition from the Lib Dems. They insist the Government’s green energy targets are sacred. Business Secretary Vince Cable said it would be ‘short-sighted and foolish’ to try to cut energy bills in the short term by tearing up the Government’s environmental policies. But Downing Street said it was right to include green energy subsidies in a wider review of measures designed to ease the financial squeeze on families. Conflict: Cameron pledged to sacrifice green taxes in a bid to ease the cost of living. Cable said that is 'foolish' Asked if the government was going to review green taxes, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘You would expect us, when families’ budgets are under pressure, to look at whether or not more can be done to help them. That’s what the Government will be doing.’ The review is expected to focus on the £1.3billion-a-year Energy Companies Obligation (Eco) scheme, which the energy firms claim will add £100 a year to bills. But other green taxes, including subsidies for windfarms and the so-called carbon price floor, which is expected to raise £1billion a year for the Government, could also come under the spotlight. The Prime Minister said this week he did not want costly subsidies for windfarms and other renewable energy to last ‘a minute longer than is necessary’. Chancellor George Osborne is also pushing for changes to green subsidies and taxes to ease energy prices. The pressure has mounted since Labour leader Ed Miliband announced he would freeze energy bills for 20 months if Labour won power in 2015 – despite having admitted in 2009 that the green taxes he brought in as Energy Minister in the Labour government were bound to push energy prices up. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'You would expect us, when families' budgets are under pressure, to look at whether or not more can be done to help them'. Chancellor George Osborne is also pushing for changes . Mr Cameron has dismissed the pledge as a ‘con’, but ministers fear the simple message could prove popular with hard-pressed voters struggling to cope with soaring bills. Some Tory ministers are pushing for the party to enter the next election pledging to scrap, water down or delay a string of green measures to bring down energy bills. Mr Osborne is keen to see some progress before his autumn statement on the economy in December. But major change is likely to be frustrated by deep-seated opposition from the Lib Dems. ‘The Tories can say what they want, but we will not back down on this,’ a Lib Dem source said last night. Price freeze: It follows Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze energy prices for 20 months . The Eco scheme is a levy on energy companies used to insulate the homes of people living in fuel poverty, who are defined as those spending more than 10 per cent of their income on heating. Much of the cost of the scheme is passed on to consumers in the form of higher bills. But the Lib Dems will fight any attempt to dilute or scrap the schemes. One Lib Dem source said: ‘The Tories keep talking about energy prices but we are talking about bills. Insulating homes will get bills down in the long run.’ Mr Cable yesterday acknowledged there was a ‘continuing argument’ within Government about the balance between green targets and affordable energy. He insisted the Lib Dems would not back down, adding: ‘If you are taking a long-term view about shifting the British economy on to a less polluting, a less carbon-based system we have to provide those incentives. ‘What will happen in the long term is that the cost of renewable energy will fall.’ The row follows the controversial announcement by energy giant SSE that it will hike prices by 8.2 per cent this winter. On average, dual-fuel bills for millions of SSE customers will rise by £111 to £1,465 a year, the highest price ever seen in the country. Other major power firms are expected to follow suit. Energy minister Michael Fallon urged the firm’s customers to shop around for a better deal. But SSE boss Alistair Phillips-Davies said the Government could help by scaling back green taxes and slowing the replacement of cheap fossil fuels with dearer renewable power. He said: ‘If we carry on firmly behind the green agenda we will continue to have price increases like this.’","Vince Cable warned against sacrificing green policies to cut energy bills .

"If you’re lucky enough to look about 18, there’s a good chance you’ll be asked to provide ID at the supermarket to buy alcohol, knives or glue. Now an addition has been made to that list of potentially hazardous items – chocolate pudding. Robert Nemeti was amazed when he was asked for ID while buying a microwaveable pudding at Tesco. Proof is in the pudding: Shopper Robert Nemeti was stunned when he was asked for ID as the dessert posed a risk to the roof of his mouth . Mr Nemeti, 24, was going through the . self-service checkout when an on-screen warning announced that his . purchase had to be ‘approved’. A member of staff at the store in Southampton hurried over and asked Mr Nemeti to produce identification. When asked why, the female assistant told him that the Cadbury Hot Chocolate Pudding would get hot when cooked and may burn him. Mr Nemeti, a photographer, yesterday described the policy as ‘crazy’ health and safety. He said he did not have any ID on him because he had just ‘nipped to the shop to buy something sweet after work’. Tesco said the machine should not have requested proof of age for the dessert (file picture) A member of staff at the store in Southampton demanded Mr Nemeti produce identification showing he was over 18 . Luckily the shop worker approved the . purchase anyway, saying she was satisfied he looked old enough to be . trusted with the £1 dessert. Mr Nemeti, from Southampton, said: ‘I . scanned through a pint of milk without any problem and then the pudding. ‘The machine beeped, flashed up a warning on the screen and an annoying automated voice warned “approval needed”. ‘I only bought two items – and they . weren’t alcohol, cigarettes, solvents or sharp – so I was clueless as to . why they would need approval. The 24-year-old described the request for his age as 'health and safety gone mad' ‘The woman who was monitoring the . self-service checkouts came over and asked me for identification showing . I was 18. I asked her why and was stunned when she told me: “It gets . hot when you cook it – and you may burn yourself”. Surely the same can . be said of many of the products they sell in any supermarket? Health and . safety has gone crazy if you now have to prove you can be trusted with a . chocolate pudding.’ He added: ‘I explained that I didn’t . have any ID. Thankfully she agreed that I looked over 18 and she scanned . her staff pass to approve the sale.’ Mr Nemeti managed to cook and eat the dessert that evening without injury.

"A entire tribe of 170 Indians have vowed to commit mass suicide after a court in Brazil ruled they must leave what they believe is sacred land, it was reported today. The community of 50 men, 50 women and 70 children from the Guarani-kaiowa tribe are camped inside a ranch in Brazil's southern state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The Indians claim the land has been the graveyard of their ancestors for centuries, according to Brazil's Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI). Protest: An ethnic Guarani-Kaiowa Brazilian Indian from the state of Mato Grosso do Sul fixes a cross into the lawn at the Esplanade of Ministries in Brasilia yesterday. His entire tribe of 170 Indians have vowed to commit mass suicide after a court ruled they must leave what they believe is sacred land . A Guarani Indian family ride a horse-drawn cart in southern Brazil in 2004. The Indians claim the disputed land has been the graveyard of their ancestors for centuries . But this week, Judge Henrique Bonachela upheld a petition made by the ranch's owner to have the tribe evicted from the land. He decreed a fine of £150 for every day the tribe remains on the land, on the banks of Brazil's Joguico River. A . spokesman for the tribe today said they do not intend to fight the . judge's decision but would rather die on the land than be made to leave. And . in a letter the tribe called on the Brazilian government to respect . their wishes to be buried there along with their ancestors. It . read: 'Because of this historic fact, we would prefer to die and be . buried together with our ancestors right here where we are now. 'We ask, one time for all, for the . government to decree our extinction as a tribe, and to send tractors to . dig a big hole and there to throw our dead bodies.

And Federal Deputy Sarney Filho warned of the 'extremely worrying' situation. In a letter to Brazil's Justice Minsitry, he wrote: 'This tribe has had its culture and lands attacked for centuries. They could now go down in history as being the tribe which wiped themselves out by committing collective suicide. 'We must take the necessary measures to avert the worst.'

"Lee Wallace is determined not to let 14 minutes of meltdown define an entire season at Rangers. As far as he is concerned, the fightback starts now. Wallace has listened to the flood of criticism that engulfed Ibrox in the wake of Monday night’s 3-1 home defeat from Hibs, which contained that extraordinary sequence of first-half concessions. Manager Ally McCoist bore the brunt of the uproar, with his position being openly questioned in some quarters, but Wallace would prefer to look in the mirror and to those who sit beside him in the dressing-room. He doesn’t hide from that fact that, bar maybe one game, the players simply haven’t met the standards they should have reached in the Championship. Rangers defender Lee Wallace insists Rangers will not let the 3-1 defeat to Hibernian define their season . Hibernian's Jason Cummings scores his second goal of the night as they defeated Rangers 3-1 at Ibrox . Yet the 27-year-old left-back also has a sense that obituaries of their campaign are being written far too early. A six-point deficit has seen Rangers replaced by Hearts as favourites for the second-tier title by some bookmakers. The Ibrox club, according to that strand of opinion, are in danger of seeing their off-field woes being replicated on the pitch as their hopes drift away. Wallace logs such predictions away for future use. Expecting to see an instant response in Saturday’s trip to Livingston, he remains steadfast in his belief that Rangers will find real form and ultimately achieve their goals. ‘I definitely think it will come,’ he said. ‘I have a belief that we can do it. ‘I’ve got a feeling that we are being written off and the manager is being questioned. That goes with the territory but I believe that, with the boys we have here, we will be fine come the end of the season. ‘We have to use the criticism positively. We know it happens and you are never going to get away from that. We are a bit more scrutinised here but we are ready for it and it’s up to us to go out there and make it better.’ The 27-year-old Wallace believes Rangers will 'use the criticism' from their loss to Hibernian 'positively' Ally McCoist (left) is under considerable pressure after another poor Rangers result . Wallace wasn’t a chief culprit against Hibs but was still one component of a back four that simply disintegrated once the first goal was leaked. Rangers have defeated Premiership opposition this term and dismantled a decent Raith Rovers outfit on their own patch. Wallace is well aware, however, that league success is founded upon steady runs of results. And be believes that is primarily the responsibility of those who actually cross the white line. ‘We have got to do a lot more as players. I look at the 11 or 12 games we’ve played so far and, Raith aside and the Inverness result, there has been no consistency in our performances. We have to find that quickly or we are going to fall behind. We have to get started soon. ‘The buck stops with us first and foremost. It’s a collective thing between the players and management. Only a couple of times this season have we found that consistency we need and that’s been the disappointing thing for me. ‘We wanted to make a mark as early as we could. We wanted to be sitting top of the league and to be the team everybody is talking about. Wallace is fully behind manager Ally McCoist and says that the side will improve as the season progresses . Cummings (second left) celebrates with his team-mates after putting Hibs 0-3 up on Monday night . ‘It’s early in the season and that’s the only positive thing. We have certainly got time and we, as players, have to start doing better on the pitch.’ McCoist led the internal inquest this week but has also tried to rally spirits and galvanise the squad ahead of their return to action. Having also lost at home to Hearts, the margin of error available to Rangers has been significantly reduced. ‘We’ve looked at the stuff from the Hibs game on the video and the manager has gone into it in detail,’ said Wallace. ‘He wasn’t happy and he was getting his message across. Now it’s up to us to respond on the park. ‘It was an open forum as we were watching the video. The players had things to say, as did the management. That’s the best way - we can both reflect, look at how we can get better and move on. Anybody can speak up. ‘At half time on Monday night a couple of the lads spoke up and at the end the dressing room was not a good place to be. Rangers boss Ally McCoist blasted his side's dismal defending after crashing to defeat . David Gray wheels away in celebration after heading home Hibs' second goal at Ibrox . ‘The manager has got us focused on the next game now. We can’t get too downbeat about it. It was disappointing in the aftermath. It’s not a great feeling when you get beat at home but you need to quickly forget about that and don’t go into the next game mumping and moaning with heads down. ‘It’s a big one for us at Livingston and the players are looking forward to it. We need to start building a bit of momentum.’ The confidence currently coursing through Hearts was underlined when Kevin McHattie this week spoke about the possibility of an unbeaten league campaign. Wallace is admiring of the start made by his former club, under the command of Robbie Neilson, but cautions them against thinking too far ahead. ‘Hearts are obviously going in the right direction,’ he admitted. ‘We wanted to hit the ground running because there were a lot of questions asked about playing against full-time opposition this season. ‘We wanted to answer that quickly but I think in time we will grow into it, build a bit of momentum and we will get back to playing football in the Premiership.’ Nicky Law celebrates scoring for Rangers, but it was only a consolation .

"Swedish military has called off the search for a 'Russian underwater vessel' thought to have been lurking in the Stockholm archipelago, after admitting that it was 'definitely not' a submarine. Navy top brass has today been forced to concede that although 'underwater activity' is confirmed, the military has ruled out the possibility that it could have been a Russian sub. This comes after Moscow blasted the hunt as 'groundless actions by the Swedish military, based on a Cold War-rhetoric'. No Russian winter: A Swedish minesweeper and a guard boat in Namdo Bay, as the military calls off the search for a suspected Russian submarine in the Baltic Sea . The week-long hunt has involved more than 200 troops, stealth ships and helicopters which have been scouring the waters off Stockholm since last Friday. The Swedish military's search for a 'foreign underwater activity' in the Baltic Sea has been the country's biggest military mobilisation since the Cold War. At a press conference this morning, the military confirmed that there had been some form of underwater activity, but that a submarine has been ruled out as the water where the activity took place is too shallow. The military has not been able to prove ‘type of vessel, nationality or activity,’ Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad said. 'There has been a suspected underwater action which is completely unacceptable.' Calling it off: Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad, pictured earlier this week, said today that the military has been able to confirm underwater activity but that it was definitely not a submarine . Protecting borders: More than 200 troops, stealth ships and helicopters which have been scouring the waters off Stockholm since last Friday in search for the 'Russian submarine' Rear Admiral Grenstad added: 'It is our conclusion that remaining in the archipelago would not give us more information. That would take weeks.' He added that although underwater action has been confirmed, the vessel has now left Swedish territory, but some troops will remain to observe the area . The military had received what it described as five credible . reports from the general public regarding  activity by foreign submarines or divers using an . underwater vehicle. Moscow has denied the reports, refuting claims that any Russian vessels have been involved. 'These baseless actions by the Swedish military, based on a Cold War-rhetoric, will only lead to increased tension in the region,' major-general Igor Konasjenkov told local reporters today. Is this it? This grainy amateur photo showing a mysterious vessel in Stockholm's archipelago was released by the Swedish military during the hunt . Some observations have been made during the search, but have been deemed of lesser note, something which the military believes may have been due to a delay in taking action. 'It is partly because we have come in at a late stage,' Jesper Tengroth, military press officer told Aftonbladet when questioned why nothing has been found. 'When we get the information [from the general public], the suspects have already been there.' The vessels were unidentified, but during . the 1980s the Swedish navy from time to time hunted suspected . Soviet submarines in its waters . The incident heightened tensions in a region where . governments are increasingly worried about Russian assertiveness . since the Ukraine crisis.

"Murdered: Juliana Redding, 21, had just posed for Maxim magazine and was preparing for her acting career to skyrocket in 2008 . Jurors in Los Angeles heard this week how a beautiful 21-year-old model and actress discovered strangled in her Santa Monica apartment battled for her life. Juliana Redding was found dead in March 2008 and prosecutors believe she was killed by Kelly Soo Park, described as the 'James Bond' style enforcer of a shady doctor who has since fled the United States. Redding's mother broke down in tears as Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy Okun-Wiese showed jurors photographs of Redding's body taken after her death. 'Juliana Redding spent the last moments of her life literally fighting to save herself,' Okun-Wiese told the jury. 'Juliana Redding tried to fight off a woman. A woman she did not know.... A woman who needs to be held accountable for her actions.' The first officer on the scene also described the gruesome scene inside the apartment where prosecutors believe Park stangled Redding with her bare hands - then turned on the gas stove and lit candles, hoping to cause an explosion. Park, 47, is alleged to have worked as an enforcer for a Dr. Munir Uwaydah and the physician dated Redding, a cover girl for Maxim magazine, for a time. During that time, Uwaydah attempted to go into business with her father, Greg, an Arizona pharmacist. Scroll Down for Video . Kelly Soo Park looks back at the audience as opening motions are made in her murder trial Wednesday, May 15, 2013. Park is charged with the 2008 killing of aspiring model and actress Juliana Redding . Female James Bond: Kelly Soo Park listens to opening statements in her murder trial on Wednesday, May 15, 2013 . Kelly Soo Park is accused on killing model Juliana Redding with her bare hands in March of 2008 . However, Greg Redding began his own background check into the doctor and discovered that Uwaydah was lying about his age, was married and had a family. On learning this, Juliana ended their affair her father also stopped the business venture he planned with Uwaydah. Greg Redding sent Uwaydah a letter on March 10th ending their business relationship - five days before his daughter was killed. Prosecutors said that Uwaydah made six-figure payments to Park and her family before the killing and before Park's arrest. They said he had also bragged that he had a 'female James Bond' ready to act. It took two years to discover a suspect in the murder and investigators linked Park through DNA evidence found on Redding's neck. However, Park's attorney has questioned the evidence. 'Forensic evidence, the DNA evidence, the fingerprint, are not conclusive. DNA evidence doesn't tell you when it got there or how it got there,' said George Buehler. The doctor was never charged in the case. He has since moved to Lebanon. Initial reports at the time described a desperate struggle during which Redding had managed to dial 911 for help when her killer apparently grabbed the phone and hung up. Prosecutors allege that Uwaydah dispatched Park to Juliana and in turn her father into changing his mind about their planned venture. While Uwaydah has since left the United States following Redding's death, he has not been charged in the murder. Prosecutors allege though, that Park had worked as a 'debt collector' for the spinal surgeon and California businessman on at least two occasions. 'Hired muscle': Prosecutors say Dr Munir Uwaydah (left) had hired Kelly Soo Park (pictured right) to intimidate and harass his enemies -- and also sent her after Juliana . Kelly Soo Park, 47, is accused of killing an aspiring actress and model in 2008 on orders of a wealthy California doctor and businessman . Park currently remains free on $3.5 million bail . According to documents seen by the Los Angeles Times, Park was officially employed as Uwaydah's real estate broker, but was paid hundreds of thousands of extra dollars to collect debts for him. The records show that Park received a $250,000 payment from Uwaydah just weeks before Redding was killed . For years, authorities have alleged that Julaiana, who was dated Dr Uwaydah, was murdered after Park was hired by the doctor to intimidate her . Uwaydah now lives in Lebanon and is not sought in connection with the murder of Redding. A court motion filed last year says that prosecutors are 'not seeking to prove that [Park] murdered Ms. Redding at the direction of Dr. Uwaydah,' only that he told Park to intimidate and threaten the young actress. Investigators in the case have said . that Park has been linked to the crime by DNA evidence found on . Redding's neck, however, defense attorney's argue that the real killer . is Redding's boyfriend at the time of her death, John Gilmore. Gilmore . was cleared as a suspect in the immediate aftermath of the murder, . insisting that he had several people who could offer him an alibi according to CBS News. 'They're . trying to point the finger at Gilmore, saying he had, at one time, . allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend,' ABC News legal analyst Dana Cole . said. The defense alleges that Gimore's assault of his fianceé Melissa Ayala casts doubt on the guilt of Park. They . allege that Ayala told a defense attorney that Gilmore choked her . saying, 'that he was going to make her feel what Juliana felt.' Investigators in the case have said that Park has been linked to the crime by DNA evidence found on Redding's neck .

"Pharrell Williams and Disney's Frozen soundtrack top the charts when it comes to music that helps parents keep children distracted in the car, reveals research by Oxford University's Dr Ruth Herbert. A leading music psychologist, Dr Herbert has looked into what is the most popular and effective means of occupying kids on long trips, with good old music the overwhelming favourite ahead of iPads and games. A majority 80 per cent of parents prefer music as the best distraction for children on road trips, with an iPad second with playing games on 19 per cent. Chart-topper: Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy tops a survey of the most popular family car songs . Family favourite: Let It Go from the Disney film Frozen joined Pharrell's blockbuster single . Just 17 per cent of the 1,000 parents scientifically surveyed for the study in conjunction with Alamo Rent A Car preferred to talk to the children as a way of keeping them entertained. Despite all the technology available to them,73 per cent of families still love family sing-a-long and the top choices of songs are Let It Go from the animated film Frozen and Pharrell's Happy. They have a key common component, says Dr Herbert. The most popular songs with kids, according to their parents, more often than not use what she describes as 'the four chords of pop'. 'The chorus of Let It Go uses the famous ""four chords of pop"" progression (I V VI IV),' Dr Herbert says in her report. 'This has been used (abused?!) as the basis of hundreds of pop songs. Old fashioned: 80 per cent of parents surveyed said music was their number one car distraction for kids . 1 LET IT GO from the film Frozen . 2 HAPPY by Pharrell Williams . 3 WHEELS ON THE BUS . 4 ROAR by Katy Perry . 5 THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU BEAUTIFUL          by One Direction . 'Whether or not you study music you will, consciously or unconsciously, be familiar with this progression. This means it's easy to join in with.' Also popular, perhaps for the same reason, is Katy Perry’s Roar and One Direction’s That’s What Makes You Beautiful, but there is still room for classic nursery rhymes with Wheels on the Bus rounding out the top five favourite car songs for kids list. Lyrics and a good beat with high energy are important to more than half of the parents when asked what they think is a good family car song, and Dr Herbert agrees, adding memorable hooks and melodies were also good factors. Games and iPads were preferred by by 19 per cent of parents on a road trip . 'Let It Go and Happy are littered with small memorable, really rhythmic phrases that coincide with repeated, striking and simple lyrics,' Dr Herbert says. 'The strongest, most 'ear-worm like', hooks occur at in the chorus - 'Here I stand and here I stay' in Let It Go and 'Cos I'm happy' in Happy. 'Both songs have a feel-good quality. They could both be considered to be 'pop anthems' - celebratory, positive statements.' Racy acts Rihanna and Lady Gaga's music is popular in the car with families, as is country legend  Dolly Parton . Hip hop is a no-no for 27 per cent of parents but they consider classical music more intrusive than rock or dance music when it comes to styles of music they'd avoid. Forget the tabloids and controversies, Lady Gaga and Rihanna are big hits in the car with 63 per cent of parents say they would play them in the car. Dolly Parton, who played at Glastonbury this year got a 60 per cent approval rating while 40 per cent would go for the festival's headliner Metallica.

"Scroll down for video . Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has joined other billionaires in pledging to give away most her of her fortune. Sandberg, 44, is the second self-made female billionaire to join the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away personal wealth, after Spanx maven Sara Blakely. She is one of seven new 'Pledgers' to commit to giving away at least half their fortunes during their lifetimes or upon their deaths. Philanthropist: Sheryl Sandberg has committed to giving a large part of her estimated $1 billion fortune away . New pledgers: Sandberg's husband Dave Goldberg has also joined the Giving Pledge . The Giving Pledge was begun by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates. Buffett himself has already said he will give away 99 per cent of his $58.5 billion net worth, and the Gates' have pledged 95 per cent. Forbes reports that Sandberg's husband Dave Goldberg, early Google employee Craig Silverstein and his wife Mary Obelnicki, Kinko's found Paul Orfalea and his wife Natalie and transport tycoon Ann Gloag also became signatories. These new additions bring the group to 127, a group that has amassed in the last four years. First female pledger: Spanx founder Sara Blakely was the first self-made female billionaire to make the pledge . However, by Forbes' count, this is less than 10 per cent of the 1,650 billionaires in existence. A group of Giving Pledgers met Friday for an annual gathering, this year held in Santa Barbara. Forbes reports that this year's event focused heavily on partnering with government to maximize impact, and social entrepreneurship. Another focus was investing in girls and women, an issue close to Sandberg's heart. Pledgers commit to giving with a Pledge Letter, which details the reasons they chose to give and to which causes they intend to dedicate their money. Billionaire's club: Warren Buffett (left) and Bill and Melinda Gates (right) were the first to pledge to give away their fortunes . Sandberg has not yet made her letter public, but she's a well-known feminist and advocate for girls and women with her own organization called the Lean In Foundation. 'We are thrilled to welcome this diverse group of business leaders and philanthropists to the pledge,' Warren Buffett said. 'They bring a wealth of expertise to the group. We will learn a lot from their experiences as we collectively aim to inspire one another to earlier and better giving.' The Associated Press reports that Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were the most generous American philanthropists in 2013, with a donation of 18 million shares of Facebook stock, valued at more than $970 million, to a Silicon Valley nonprofit in December.","Sheryl Sandberg has pledged to give at least half of her fortune away during her lifetime or upon her death .

"Republican Senator Ted Cruz's father has revived the birther conspiracy theories by saying that the President should be sent 'back to Kenya, back to Indonesia'. Rafael Cruz was speaking at an event on Fort Worth during his son's Senate campaign 2012. The video was unearthed by Mother Jones, and Senator Cruz's staff is now trying to distance themselves from the man he has repeatedly called 'his hero'. During the 2012 event, the elder Mr Cruz denounces the Obama administrations work and goes on to draw on the President's upbringing. Scroll down for video . Speaking to the crowd: Rafael Cruz was at a campaign event for his son in Fort Worth in 2012 when he made the controversial remarks about how President Obama should be sent 'back to Kenya, back to Indonesia' 'The path of this administration is to make us a third world country and to make us second to the United Nations,' the 74-year-old Cruz is heard saying to the crowd. He goes to espouse concerns about the United Nation's sustainable development implementation plan called Agenda 21, and the organization's Law of the Sea Treaty- both of which are lighning rods for conservatives who fear the overreach of outside organizations on national sovereignty. 'They are pushing very hard for the United Nations to have taxing authority and Obama is very much one of the big promoters of this,' he says. 'We need to send Barack Obama back to Chicago. I'd like to send him back to Kenya, back to Indonesia.' His hero: Ted Cruz has refused to denounce the comments and has repeatedly spoken about how he looks up to his 74-year-old father Rafael . Making it clear that the speech was . connected to the then-ongoing campaign that his son was waging, he . followed the controversial statement with a concluding one after the . applause broke: 'We absolutely need to retake the Senate.' Mother Jones, the liberal website that published the video, is the same site that unearthed the video of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney writing off '47 per cent' of the American electorate who were not going to vote for him because they benefited from government handouts. When the video was made public on Thursday, Senator Cruz's spokesman responded saying that Rafael did not speak for his son. 'These selective quotes, taken out of context, mischaracterize the substance of Pastor Cruz's message. Like many Americans, he feels America is on the wrong track,' the spokesman said according to the Fox News affiliate in Dallas-Fort Worth. Focused on other things: The video emerged on Thursday while the President and First Lady greeted thousands of children to the White House as part of the Halloween festivities . The quote in question may become an issue for Senator Cruz, who is beloved by many Tea Party activists and has been frequently mentioned as a possible Republican presidential candidate in the 2016 race. If that ends up being a serious consideration, Cruz will have his own birthplace issues to deal with as he was born in Canada. His father is a Cuban immigrant and his mother is American. The Senator has dual citizenship to Canada and America, and has said that if it becomes an issue he will renounce his Canadian citizenship.","Republican Senator's father Rafael Cruz was speaking at campaign event in Fort Worth in 2012 when he made the remarks .

"A 22-year-old accused of gunning down his parents and brother at their home was planning a Columbine-style massacre at a local high school, police revealed. Trey Eric Sesler, an online animation enthusiast and critic from Texas, was arrested on Tuesday after a daylong manhunt following the the discovery of the three bodies, which had multiple gunshot wounds. Under questioning from police, he told them he and another former Waller High School student were planning a mass shooting at the school and now investigators are questioning the friend concerning the plot. Plans: Trey Eric Sesler was said to be planning a Columbine-style massacre at the local school with a friend . Obsessed: Sesler appears to have had a fascination with guns and rifles and he posted many pictures of himself posing with them. he is believed to have shot his family with a high-powered rifle . According to the Houston Chronicle, Sesler had an obsession with the 1999 massacre in which two students shot dead 12 students and one teacher before killing themselves. He was also obsessed with guns and is believed to have had several - including handguns and high-powered rifles - at his home. He has been charged with capital murder in the deaths of Lawton Ray Sesler Jr, 58, his wife Rhonda Wyse Sesler, 57, and their son, Mark Alan Sesler, 26, who were found dead at their one-story, ranch-style home. Writing was said to have been written over the walls of the home expressing remorse. Michael Williams, a crime scene investigator and detective with the Waller Police Department, told the Chronicle that two weeks ago, Sesler made a strange call to police. He said: 'He just called us one day about something bizarre. He said he was sitting in the backyard and that a bullet whizzed by his head and that he had gotten his guns and he was ready.' Someone reported gunshots coming from the home on Monday evening but when police arrived they discovered nothing. Waller County Sheriff Glenn Smith said: 'This was a scene that had a lot of violence. The house was ransacked. 'Evidence was obtained and it was pretty . obvious the connection of the other brother and son to these people.' Trey . Sesler has no criminal record, according to the Houston Chronicle. Suspected killer: A family member described Sesler as 'peculiar' but he has no criminal record and was an amine enthusiast who posted reviews online . Crime scene: The bodies of Sesler's parents and brother were discovered around 1pm at their Houston home after police received a call from concerned relatives . Waller Police Chief Phil Rehak said: 'The best way for me to describe the residence is it looked like a war zone – a tremendous amount of damage inside the residence, the crime scene was not contained to one area of the residence. 'It was from one end of the residence to the other, front to back, which is unusual.' He was arrested at a friend's home just hours after the bodies were found. Investigators said Sesler had several guns with him at the time. Police have said they don’t know why . Sesler would want to kill his family, but that it was an exceptionally . violent, angry crime. For the last four years, he has used an . online alter ego called Mr Anime, the star and producer of several short . films and also a reviewer of Japanese animation. He . has a YouTube channel, with more than one million views which he calls . Lenscap productions. Some of the amateur movies he made star his . brother. A large number of the anime he . reviews have violent themes. For example, in one, which is called . Highschool Of The Dead, Sesler has a large rifle in . his hands while he talks to the camera. YouTube: His onscreen persona is Mr Anime. He has more than 4,000 subscribers and more than one million video views . Dangerous props: In one of Sesler's YouTube videos, he waves around a large rifle while reviewing an anime called High School Of The Dead . At one point he seems to get very excited when talking about . the zombies killing the mortals as there is 'blood everywhere'. Yet another one is called Death Note . and another one is called Slayers. The beginning of all of his reviews, . he plays a short clip in which he shoots someone in the chest. On his Facebook page he wrote: 'I . really like to take it easy and have a nice time. I'm really interested . in my education as a college student and am really excited about . graduating in a few years. 'I plant things sometimes in the spring like peppers and strawberries. My car is currently the most exciting part of my days.' Aunt Weda Frierson called her nephew 'peculiar' when interviewed by the Houston Chronicle. She said: 'I'll have to admit, he was quite . strange. But naturally, I wasn't going to tell Trey's parents that he . acts peculiar. 'His father was a very private person and . never really discussed him with me at all.' She said she believed he was on some kind of medication for a health condition but didn't know what. Lawton and Rhonda Sesler were married 34 years. She worked at the Waller Times. He taught at Robinson Elementary in the Cy-Fair Independent School District and grew up in Waller. District officials said staff and students at Robinson were saddened by the news of Lawton Sesler's death. 'With more than 30 years of teaching experience, he made the difference in the lives of hundreds of students during his career,' officials said in a statement. 'He was a Spotlight teacher in 2000 and 2006, selected for his outstanding contributions as a teacher.'","Trey Eric Sesler was arrested after a daylong manhunt .

"A German neurologist claims to have found the area of the brain where evil lurks in killers, rapists and robbers. Bremen scientist Dr Gerhard Roth says the 'evil patch' lies in the brain's central lobe and shows up as a dark mass on X-rays. He discovered it when investigating violent convicted offenders over the years for German government studies. Dr Gerhard Roth demonstrates where the 'evil patch' can be identified in the brains of those inclined to violence . Scans studied by Dr Roth indicate that the patch he says is associated with wicked behaviour is found at the front of the brain . 'We showed these people short films and measured their brain waves,' he said. 'Whenever there were brutal and squalid scenes the subjects showed no emotions. In the areas of the brain where we create compassion and sorrow, nothing happened.' The dark mass at the front of the brain, he says, appears in all scans of people with records for criminal violence. He says his researches have led him to believe that some criminals have a 'genetic predisposition' to violence. He added: 'When you look at the brain scans of hardened criminals, there are almost always severe shortcomings in the lower forehead part of the brain. 'There are cases where someone becomes criminal as a result of a tumour or an injury in that area, and after an operation to remove the tumour, that person was completely normal again. Dictators: Josef Stalin (left) and Adolf Hitler (right) belong to Dr Roth's third group - pure psychopaths . 'Or there are physiological deficits, . because certain substances such as serotonin in the forebrain are not . working effectively. 'But this is definitely the region of the brain where evil is formed and where it lurks. 'Of course it is not automatic. The brain can compensate somewhat for violent tendencies and it is unclear how that works. Psychpathy  is a personality disorder that has been variously characterised by shallow emotions (including reduced fear, a lack of empathy, and stress tolerance), coldheartedness, egocentricity, superficial charm, manipulativeness, irresponsibility, impulsivity, criminality, antisocial behavior, a lack of remorse, and a parasitic lifestyle. Terrorists are sometimes called psychopaths, and comparisons can be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish worldview that precludes welfare for others, lack of remorse or guilt, and blaming external events. While no psychiatric or psychological organisation has sanctioned a diagnosis of 'psychopathy' itself, assessments of psychopathy are widely used in criminal justice settings in some nations and may have important consequences for individuals. 'But . when I will look at young people, and I see there are developmental . disorders in the lower forehead brain, I can say that there is a felon . in the making with 66 per cent probability. 'It is easy to spot this anti-social behaviour from very early on.' Dr Roth said no two criminals are alike. He divides them into three groups for the purposes of his hunt for evil. The first he classifies as 'psychologically healthy,' people who grow up in an environment where it is 'OK to beat, steal and murder'. The second type is the mentally disturbed criminal who looks at his world as threatening. 'A wrong look, one false move, he can explode and become a killer,' he said. The third group are pure psycopaths, a group in which tyrants such as Hitler and Stalin belong. He said not all monsters are born and that many are made worse by their environments on their roads to evil. He added: 'Experts detect a mental decline in some people that begins in the kindergarten. It is the task of society to offer widespread support to the children and their parents before they become criminals.' Dr Roth is one of Germany's best-known brain specialists and has was at the forefront of calling for sentencing reforms a few years ago.","Scans reveal a patch at the front of the brain can be seen in people with records for criminal violence .

"A Chinese man was left stunned after he went to the doctor experiencing stomach aches and blood in his urine – only to discover that he was a woman on his period. The married 44-year-old man from Zhejiang province, China, visited his local doctor with his wife in Yongkang where he made the shocking discovery that he had, all along, in fact been a woman. After a full examination, doctors discovered that he had a full set of female reproductive organs along with a penis - which he said had given him an active sex life with his wife of ten years. Tests: A man in Zhejiang province, China made the shocking discovery that he was a woman . PMT: Doctors told him that his stomach ache was actually his monthly period . But doctors doubted this. Doctors found that his genitals were different from other men and he did not possess an Adam’s apple. A spokesman for First People’s Hospital of Yongkang said that doctors doubted that Mr Chen was a female at first. He said: ‘He was wearing men's clothes with short hair, so we didn’t think that he would be a female at the beginning’. However, Mr Chen said that he had known that something was wrong with him after he found himself constantly feeling fatigued with swollen face and legs. Even worse, he constantly found blood in his urine. A CT scan soon revealed that he had a uterus and ovaries. Female reproductive system: The man had a full set of female reproductive organs along with a penis . Meanwhile, a chromosome examination showed that Mr Chen had a pair of XX sex chromosomes, making him genetically female. The . condition of being 'Intersex' affects one in every 2,000 births in the . UK (although figures may be much higher) and there are an estimated . 30,000 intersex people in the UK. There are several known abnormalities that can lead to specific sexual ambiguity. So called 'XX male syndrome' occurs . in people who have two X chromosomes - one of which contains a . significant amount of genetic material from a Y chromosome. These people appear to be male, but . are, in fact, genetically female. Typically, they will possess male sex . organs, but these will often be underdeveloped. They will also often develop breasts and maintain a high-pitched speaking voice. In fact, biologists now recognise a . host of conditions, both genetic and otherwise, which are labelled . under the umbrella term 'intersex' - which replaces older terms such as . 'hermaphrodite'. Intersex people may be genetically . female, but physiologically male. Some will be true hermaphrodites, . producing both eggs and sperm. Mr Chen was also suffering from Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, a genetic disease that causes the adrenal glands to swell due to a decrease in stress hormone and an increase in male sex hormones. A lump was later surgically removed from his adrenal glands. This type of medical case is extremely rare and doctors have not confirmed whether Mr Chen was a hermaphrodite or intersex. But he did appear to have two types of genitalia. Doctors said it was too late for Mr Chen to seek medical treatment for his unusual problem as it was only effective for younger people.","The man went to his doctor in China complaining of severe stomach ache .

"Texas Senator Ted Cruz previewed the likely 2016 Republican presidential attacks on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday, slamming the presumptive Democratic nominee as 'consistently wrong on domestic policy and foreign policy.' And he lambasted her for clinging to a health insurance overhaul proposal when her husband Bill Clinton was president, saying '""Hillarycare"" ... would have been every bit as disastrous' as he believes the Affordable Care Act has become. Mainstream media outlets have 'already moved her into the White House,' he complained of Clinton, who was also a U.S. Senator before moving to the State Department, during an interview at a Washington, D.C. breakfast event. But most of his ire was reserved for Mrs. Clinton's stewardship of U.S. foreign policy. Ted Cruz tore into Hillary Clinton during a breakfast event at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., in a possible preview to the 2016 presidential slugfest . Cruz said Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, presided over 'disastrous' foreign policy, but still has a 40 per cent chance to be elected president . 'When you look at the foreign policy disaster that is Obama,' said Cruz, 'a great deal of that lands on her doorstep, and she was directly responsible for it.' 'The president's foreign policy has been an absolute debacle … alienating allies and cozying up to enemies,' Cruz told a capacity-crowd audience at the Newseum, a short distance from the U.S. Capitol. And he alleged that the State Department and the White House 'are repeating the mistakes [of North Korea] with Iran.' 'The degree of religious fanaticism with the willingness to sacrifice life makes the prospect of a nuclear Iran extraordinarily dangerous,' Cruz said, in a moment that sounded like a line from a presidential stump speech. President Obama has seen a stunning plunge in Americans' perception of his influence abroad, with 53 per cent telling Gallup pollsters this month that they don't think other world leaders respect him. The debacle in Benghazi, Libya, where armed terrorists attacked and razed U.S. diplomatic outposts following the State Department's refusal to provide more security, is a continuing embarrassment that the White House avoids discussing at every turn. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens perished in the attack, along with three security personnel. Asked for a one-word response to the name 'Barack Obama,' Cruz responded with a riff on a Bushism -- 'Non-strategery' -- then changed his answer  to 'imperial' 'Disaster': Obama's White House has struggled with Iranian and Syrian crises, with Republicans saying Syrian president Bashar al-Assad (R) and Iranian leaders like  parliamentary national security chief Alaeddin Boroujerdi (L), are openly defying U.S. ultimatums . And America's standing with Russia and other countries that previous administrations had held at bay has deteriorated since Obama became president, in the wake of a hands-off strategy that Republicans say has emboldened President Vladimir Putin and other adversarial leaders. Benghazi: The loss of a U.S. ambassador on Mrs. Clinton's watch will dog her in 2016 if she runs for president . Yesterday a Russian warship docked in Havana, Cuba, drawing comparisons to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the epic standoff between the Kennedy White House and the Soviet Union, modern Russia's anti-America predecessor. Cruz has been the Senate's most outspoken opponent of the Affordable Care Act, last year staging a nearly day-long quasi-filibuster in an attempt to leverage a threatened government shutdown to force changes to Obamacare. He suggested Thursday that a second Clinton presidency would deepen the health insurance overhaul's problems. Clinton's 1994 'Hillarycare' proposals, he said, 'would have been every bit as disastrous' as the currently dysfunctional Obamacare program. And arguing for continued Republican leadership in Congress, he charged that 'it was only because of House Republicans that Obamacare was stopped from being the same disaster as Hillarycare.' Cruz said Clinton has a '40 per cent chance' of becoming president in 2016, and that she will likely be the Democratic nominee if she runs. National Journal declared Kentucky Senator Rand Paul the GOP's 'leader of the pack' on Wednesday. Cruz resisted the temptation to put distance between himself and his presumed rival, however. 'I think Rand Paul is terrific,' he told interviewer Mike Allen, Politico's chief White Hosue correspondent, calling him 'an important voice for liberty in the party, and helping to bring Republicans back to the principles we should be standing for.' Asked about his Democratic opponents – 'What do the Mean Girls of the Senate do?'  – Cruz leveled a quip meant for Allen's bosses. 'They leak stories to Politico,' he said.","Texas Republican Senator opens fire on the former Secretary of State whose path to the Democratic presidential nomination seems wide open .

"The newly-formed branch of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent has botched its first attempt at a terror attack after jihadists mistook a Pakistani naval ship for a U.S. aircraft carrier. Ten heavily armed militants from the terror cell had planned to storm an American military vessel in Karachi's sea dock - but found a Pakistani naval frigate in it's place. The men were easily overwhelmed before they could do any damage, investigators said, with three of the militants killed and the remaining seven arrested. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri formally announced the founding of a terror cell in the Indian subcontinent two weeks ago in the hope of reviving his ailing extremist group, which has suffered diminishing support since the unprecedented rise of rival Islamic extremist group ISIS. Scroll down for video . Target? The vessel Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent tried to attack may have been the USS George Washington, which is believed to have been stationed off the coast of west Pakistan on the day of the incident . Location: Fishing boats are moored near a naval dockyard in Pakistan's port city of Karachi. On September 5, Al Qaeda militants attempted to storm a U.S. military vessel here, but found a Pakistani naval frigate in it's place . Despite the failure of the terror attack on September 6, Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent  claimed responsibility - adding that the men involved were all former members of the Pakistani navy. 'The Naval officers who were martyred on Saturday in the attack on Karachi were Al Qaeda members. They were trying to attack American marines and their cronies,' the group said in a statement released last Thursday. 'The Pakistani military men who died defending enemies of the Muslim nation...are cursed with hell', they added, apparently still incorrectly believing the attacked vessel had been a U.S.aircraft carrier. The craft the group intended to strike may have been the USS George Washington, believed to have been stationed off the coast of west Pakistan on the day of the incident, having left Japanese waters the previous day. Investigators have also denied that the militants were all former members of the Pakistani navy, saying only one of the 10 men was from a naval background. Rivalry: Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri (right) announced the formation of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent in the hope it would encourage would-be jihadists to join his waning group instead of ISIS - the terror group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (left) that currently control vast swaths of the Syria and Iraq . News of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent's failure to carry out the terror attack was met with mockery by ISIS sympathizers on social media, who branded the group out of date . There were also suggestions that the attack may not even have been carried out by Al Qaeda at all, and that its increasingly desperate leadership is simply claiming credit for another group's botched work in the hope it makes them appear more active than they are currently capable of being. This line of inquiry appears to be reinforced by the delay of five days between the failed storming and Al Qaeda's statement claiming responsibility - with the terror group likely waiting to see if the real culprits came forward to admit the embarrassing effort before claiming it for themselves. A senior investigator speaking to the Telegraph described the attack as a 'complete failure' and suggested there may be further arrests relating to the incident. 'They were well-equipped and came with the intention of taking a ship into their custody but they were caught in the initial stages,' the unnamed source was quoted as saying. The formation of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent was tailored to counter the flagging image of the group - which has suffered a reversal in fortunes since former leader Osama bin Laden died. Decline: With an unprecedented wave of extremists pledging allegiance to rival Islamic extremist group ISIS (pictured), Al Qaeda is struggling to recruit new members to its cause and is even suspected of claiming responsibility for failed attacks it did not actually carry out in order to appear more active . David Cameron is preparing to join airstrikes on ISIS in the wake of the murder of British hostage David Haines - but will not move until after this week’s Scottish referendum, it was claimed today. The Prime Minister is under mounting pressure from MPs to act against the ISIS terror threat but has so far resisted calls to recall Parliament to authorise a bombing campaign in the Middle East. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will attend a summit in Paris today in an attempt to forge a coalition of countries – including Arab states – into a military alliance to push back the jihadist advance. The Prime Minister will then attend the UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday where he is expected to outline plans to combat ISIS. MPs have been told to expect to be recalled on the Thursday after the UN session, according to the Daily Telegraph. It comes after Mr Cameron attacked the ‘monstrous’ fanatics responsible for the murder of Mr Haines this weekend. Al Qaeda members have previously carried out atrocities such as the simultaneous United States embassy truck bombings in East Africa in 1998, the September 11 plane attacks in the United States in 2001, and the London Underground bombings on July 7, 2005. But the group has lost direction and support since its founder Osama Bin Laden was killed by a team of U.S Navy Seals in Pakistan in 2011 - not least after subsequent leader al-Zawahiri blacklisted former Al Qaeda loyalists ISIS last year and condemning the group for exhibiting unnecessary brutality. ISIS has since gained vast swathes of territory in the Middle East and attracted thousands of Western extremists to fight under its banner in Syria and Iraq - including at least 500 Britons. Earlier this year ISIS' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared the terror group a 'caliphate' and declared himself a caliph - the spiritual leader of all Muslims worldwide. The group has also carried out the sickening filmed murders of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and of the British aid worker David Haines. News of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent's failure to successfully carry out the terror attack has been met with mockery by ISIS sympathizers. Extremists took to Twitter to brand the group 'out of date' and condemned it for committing terror attacks without ever attempting to seize territory.","Ten militants stormed Pakistani naval ship after mistaking it for U.S. vessel .

"A man cut his throat with a knife in a benefits advice office in a protest about the controversial bedroom tax. The middle-aged man said he was 'sick of all this s***' then dragged a blade through skin from his ear down to his throat on each side of his neck. The wounds left him and the floor of the Runcorn office spattered with blood, a witness said. The bedroom tax was widely protested across the country - and was apparently too much for one man who slit his throat in protest about it . The gory outburst happened at about 2pm on Monday, at Halton Direct Link in Halton Lea shopping centre. Staff hit an emergency alarm during the incident. The witness, who was waiting in line to see an adviser, said no other residents reacted to the outburst but that staff seemed 'a little bit shocked'. He said: 'From what I could see, the bloke had gone to see an adviser. Chancellor George Osborne's bedroom tax prompted the dramatic outburst . 'He was upset about the bedroom tax and wasn't getting through and he started to cut his throat on both sides and threw the knife on the floor and he had blood coming from his neck. 'There was a lot of blood but it hadn't come out of his artery, he wasn't gushing out blood. 'He went through the side of his neck from his ear to the front. Everyone was just sat about waiting to go and see the adviser. I was in the queue. Nobody did nothing.' A Halton Council spokesman said: 'We are aware of this incident. 'The person concerned is receiving appropriate support and we are supporting our staff who witnessed the incident.' Cheshire police officers have spoken to the man, who suffered 'minor injuries', about his well-being. No criminal offences were reported. In April the so-called 'bedroom tax' was introduced, which will see social housing tenants with spare rooms docked an average of £14 a week in benefits. Around 660,000 people are set to lose some of their housing benefit from the change, which is expected to save the Government £465million a year. The charge is aimed at reducing over-crowding in social housing and directing benefits towards those who are most in need. But Labour attacked the move, with shadow chancellor Ed Balls denouncing it as 'possibly the worst, most cack-handed and massively unfair piece of policy-making I've ever seen'.","Dragged a blade from his ear down to his throat on each side of his neck .

Mr Ratcliff, who had flown his drone for five days without a problem, left his remote-controlled quadcopter with his Chinese assistant while he went to get some batteries and returned to find her with a 'rather surly looking female police officer'. Mr Ratcliff  said deciding to 'fly a drone over China is kind of like Luke Skywalker deciding to ride his landspeeder on the Death Star' He was at Belhai Park, a public park northwest of the Forbidden City, and was unaware of nearby government intelligence buildings when he was arrested . Mr Ratcliff said he had flown his drone for five days without a problem before he was approached by a 'rather surly looking female police officer' They were escorted to a dimly lit area of a police station where he was questioned by a 'rather burly gentleman officer'. 'I had a feeling that I was in a rather sensitive area that I did not know about. So I was sure I had indeed done something wrong, but I just didn’t know what,' Mr Ratcliff said. 'He was holding the quadcopter and turning it around, examining the camera, the blades, the everything. The photographer and his Chinese assistant were escorted to a dimly lit area of a police station where he was questioned about the use of the drone . Mr Ratcliffe showed photos of his previous endeavors on his phone to prove to Chinese officers he was actually a photographer . 'I basically explained that I was a photographer, and I like getting unique angles. I simply like taking photos and making Beijing look beautiful. I noticed they liked to hear this and were a bit surprised.' Mr Ratcliffe showed photos of his previous endeavors on his phone to Chinese officers to prove he was a photographer and they were 'all crowding around, smiling and laughing, pointing'. The burly officer gave Ratcliffe back his quadcopter and told him not to fly it inside the inner and second rings that circle Beijing.

"Tablet users have managed to annoy the world with their photo-taking habits - but this bizarre new trend could put even the most brazen photographer to shame.

"A family in Pooler, Georgia, are desperately trying to raise enough money to adopt a special needs child from Eastern Europe who they hope to save from probably death within the next five years. Christie and Raymundo Orta, together with their daughter Laura, are on a mission to raise $35,000 to adopt Evan, a two-year-old boy with Down Syndrome who lives in an orphanage. Evan was abandoned by his parents as a one-month old and has been lying in a crib with little medical care, and no opportunity for education or therapy for the past two years. Scroll down for video . The Orta family from Pooler, Georgia, are on a mission to raise $35,000 so they can adopt Evan, right, a two-year-old boy with Down Syndrome who is currently languishing in an orphanage in Eastern Europe . If Evan isn’t adopted by the time he is five years old, he will be transferred to an adult institution where he isn’t expected to live beyond a year or two at the most. While the life expectancy for a child with Down Syndrome in the United States is 60 years old, in much of Eastern Europe it is 6-8 years old. Christie Orta, a special education teacher, told WTOC that she feels it is her calling to save Evan from his likely fate. ‘It is something I do every day with my job, and I had always thought that it takes a special family to raise a child with a disability.’ she said. Baby Evan was abandoned by his parents as a one-month-old and has been lying in a crib with little medical care, and no opportunity for education or therapy for the past two years . The family found out about Evan via Reece’s Rainbow, an organization which seeks to find families for orphans with Down syndrome and other special needs. The family’s fundraising efforts have so far including a cookie sale by daughter Laura and there is a Zumba fundraiser on December 6 in Pooler. ‘Evan needs us....we need him!! The only mountain standing in our way is that it will cost about $35,000 to bring Evan home....which is an UNBELIEVABLE amount of money...but when you fall in love, you set out to do amazing and miraculous things,’ Christie Orta wrote on her GoFundMe page. ‘We know that God has moved our hearts to pursue this adoption. We also have faith that God will help us to raise the amount of money needed to rescue Evan and ultimately save his life.’ Video: Family raising funds to adopt boy from overseas .

"The headline on an easily-found and well put together YouTube video in homage of Daley Blind is: Amazing Goals, Skills, Passes, Tackles. The reality is that the video contains Blind's one Manchester United goal – admittedly a cracker away at West Brom in October – and lots of clips of the other – rather more mundane – things that the Dutch international was brought to Old Trafford last summer to do. Every team in the Barclays Premier League needs a nuts-and-bolts man, of course. The simple things on a football need still need doing. Daley Blind scoring his only goal (so far) for the club in the clash with West Bromwich Albion in october . Blind poses with his shirt after joining Manchester United, Louis van Gaal and Radamel Falcao are also present . For some, though, what you do is not enough and when Blind sat down with English journalists on Wednesday, he was asked about Gary Neville's observation that: 'He plays far too many square passes and takes the easy option.' Rather damning words from a former United captain and words that Blind admitted had not escaped his attention. 'Of course, I listen to him but I try to play my own game and does what the trainer wants from me and that is to keep possession,' said Blind. 'There is always someone who wants to say something about the trainers or the teams otherwise there would be no interest in TV. 'I can take a bit of criticism. The people on television can say what they want. You hear it but I think I have played some good games. Blind was signed after impressing for Ajax in the Eredivisie and for Holland at the World Cup . 'Of course you can sometimes play the ball forward but sometimes it is good to keep the ball in possession and make your team-mates play better. 'I can make other players more important than myself. If I can do that by switching the play to the other side or wait for the right moment to do that then I will. 'If there is space forward then I will play that ball but sometimes I think it is better to keep possession, to switch from side to side and move the ball and search for players who can make an individual action. I am not a player who does that. I like the possession game and keep the ball.' Neville has a well-deserved reputation as one of our better TV pundits. Buried in Blind's observations, though, are words that one would expect to meet with his approval. When he says that 'I can make other players more important than myself', Blind would appear to be buying in not only to a philosophy that took Holland further than they expected to go in last summer's World Cup but was also fundamental to United's success during the years Neville played the game. Blind clears the ball while under pressure from QPR's Chilean forward Eduardo Vargas . The former Ajax man applauds the fans after United beat QPR in their Premier League clash . Blind, 24, was brought to United by his former national coach Louis van Gaal as a more than capable footballer but also as something of a messenger. After all when you are trying to change things round at a football club – trying to change people's heads – then it's handy to have a couple of people who already get it. So far, Blind has probably earned himself about a 7/10 rating at Old Trafford. Not bad for a player who missed chunk of early winter with a serious knee injury. Now that he is back and playing again, he expects United to make progress on the back of the principles that took an admittedly average Dutch side to a World Cup semi-final last July. 'We didn't play very great football at the World Cup but we were a team and we were winning games and we started playing better after winning,' he recalled. The 24-year-old challenges Southampton midfielder Steven Davis at old Trafford . Blind warms up with team-mates Juan Mata and Angel di Maria before the clash with Saints . 'We improved. You change the system and you get better, you become a team and you start winning. 'At United I don't think the whole philosophy of the club has changed in the way we are playing. This is what the manager wants and I agree with it. 'He is very clear in what he wants. We all understand what he wants. 'The coach expects a lot from his players. He is very honest and direct in what he wants. That is a good thing. 'He makes players better and he makes teams better. I like that in a coach. That is his most important asset. The versatile midfielder attempts to evade QPR midfielder Joey Barton at Loftus Road . Blind was criticised recently by former United captain Gary Neville . 'There are games we are doing things every well but games when we can do it better. We are improving.' On Friday night in Cambridge, United will face the latest examination of their claim to be an improving side. An FA Cup tie on a Friday night against a League Two side should be enough to concern a team that has already lost 4-0 to Milton Keynes in the Capital One Cup and worked hard to win 2-0 at Yeovil Town in the last round of this competition. Added to the fact that Van Gaal's Premier League record since his appointment is equivalent to his predecessor David Moyes and it is clear that United need to make tangible progress and quickly. 'I know United haven't won the cup for 11 years and if you are in the race for a title or a cup then you want to be the champion,' added Blind. 'Whether it is the league or the cup you want to win it. 'We knew it was going to be difficult in the Premier League but we have to keep our heads up. We have to keep faith.'","Gary Neville criticised Manchester United's Daley Blind .

"The president of Germany has decorated the nation's World Cup-winning squad with the country's highest honour for sports, after their tournament victory in Brazil this summer. President Joachim Gauck, joined by Chancellor Angela Merkel, presented the players with the Silver Laurel Leaf in a ceremony at the head of state's Bellevue Palace after describing their efforts in South America as a 'convincing performance that is recognised ungrudgingly by all its opponents.' Speaking a day after the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gauck noted that Germany's fourth World Cup is its first as a reunited nation - with West Germany winning the title shortly before reunification in 1990.

"Roy Hodgson claims Everton starlet Ross Barkley can have the same impact on the England set up as former midfielder Paul Gascoigne.

Ross Barkley is the same. ‘I think he’s a player with excellent technique, can score goals, interprets the role well, that role, if you like, in behind the front player is a role that Roberto Martinez at Everton believes in strongly, they do a lot of work on it and he interprets the role very well. ‘Obviously we lost him through a long period of time through injury, pleased to have him back, he does give us that enormous possibility if he doesn’t start the game he is a player coming off the bench who can make a difference.

"The Texas teacher, filmed having sex with four students at her suburban home, has spoken out claiming that she is the actual victim in the case. Brittni Colleps, 28, a former English teacher at the Kennedale High School outside Fort Worth, Texas, says that the students, who were all aged 18, conspired to film their sex romp without her consent and distributed the footage and that in no way did she every prey on anybody. Meanwhile, Colleps' husband Christopher, an Army specialist who was away when his wife was having sex with students in May 2011, said he still loves the mother of his three children and even pleaded with the jury to show her mercy in sentencing. Scroll down for excepts of Brittni Colleps' interview with 20/20 . Victim? Brittni Colleps told ABC's 20/20 that the students, who were all aged 18, conspired to film their sex romp without her consent . Not to blame: Colleps insists she is not a sexual predator, in an interview with ABC's 20/20 . Colleps, who was sentenced in August to five years in jail for 16 counts of having improper relationships with students, now says, 'I felt like I was victimized in that video, because I did not, I never gave my consent for it,' in an interview with ABC's 20/20. 'I'm not trying to say that it's not wrong or immoral for a teacher to have a sexual relationship with her students  ... but I don't think that in this situation when they were legal, consenting adults - it should not affect me or anyone else legally.' 'In no way, shape or form was I ever preying on anybody. I never coerced anybody to do anything, I never bribed anybody to do anything, I didn't offered grades in exchange for anything.' Colleps' husband Christopher has experienced a roller-coaster ride of emotions since discovering his wife was cheating, in addition to the ensuing criminal case - telling 20/20 that learning of her betrayal was the 'toughest thing I've ever had to hear.' Filled with emotion: 32-year-old Christopher Colleps, in August, wipes away tears as he pleads with the jury to spare his wife from jail . Mercy: Brittni Colleps is overcome as her husband pleads for leniency before her sentencing in August . But the 32-year-old, who testified that he and his wife had engaged in group sex on previous occasions, says he still loves Colleps and he asked the jury to spare his wife from jail. 'I love her with every part of my heart, every ounce of my being,' her husband told the jury. Guilty: Brittni Colleps was convicted on 16 counts of having improper relationships with students . 'I'm asking that you give her probation ... because it's not mine or my children's fault.' Christopher Colleps, was away at Louisiana’s Fort Polk when his wife was having sex with her students. In the 20/20 interview, the cuckold said that dealing with the aftermath of this affair will be punishment enough for his wife. 'When our children get old enough, she has to look them in the eye and tell them what she did. That is punishment,' he said. Similarly, Colleps mother asked the jury to not sentence Brittni to jail, for the sake of her family. 'I'm asking you to have mercy for her kids cause they need their mom.' Despite her family's pleas, she was . sentenced to five years in prison without parole. The case against Colleps has garnered national attention, as inappropriate student-teacher relationships have been on the rise across the U.S. For Colleps, it all began with an innocuous text message to a student, asking what time a school game was scheduled to start - but it soon escalated into sexting and at one time Colleps and the unidentified student were exchanging as many as 100 sexually explicit texts a day. The lewd communication included messages like, 'I'm an anything goes in sex kinda girl' and 'I like pullin' hair, bitin', scratchin', spanking, I even like being choked,' according to Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Beach, who also spoke to 20/20. Consenting adults: Brittni Colleps, with her attorney during her trial, said all students willingly participated . Left behind: Brittni Colleps family have stood by her side throughout the salacious case . Then in April 2011, Colleps  invited this student to come to her home to watch a movie and the two had sex. The student returned to her home on at least four occasions to have sex. In May, he invited three friends from the football team to her home, while her husband and three children were away. According to prosecutors, the teacher stripped down to her lingerie, displayed an array of sex toys and escorted the four young men to her bedroom for a group sex session. According to video footage, taken by one of the students, 'she's performing one sex act on one student, and she is simultaneously performing another sex act on another student, and she has farmed out her kids for the night so that she can have four students in, and engage in what is more or less an orgy,' Beach explained. Teacher: Colleps taught English at the Kennedale High School outside Fort Worth, Texas . After the encounter, the student began circulating the footage and it made its way to the school's administration. Because the students were of consenting age, there were no rape charges but Texas law prohibits an inappropriate relationship between a student and teacher. At her trial, three of the students testified that they didn't believe she did nothing wrong and that they weren't victims. 'These were not boys these were not children. These were grown men who connived, conspired and worked with each other to be with this woman,' Colleps' attorney Lex Johnston had said at her trial. 20/20 Interview with Brittni Colleps, teacher who had group sex with students .

"Project Underskin: The next big thing in wearable technology may be a tattoo implanted in the skin . From smartphones to Google Glass, this past decade has brought a wave of new technology and technological advances, and in the next five years, those advances are expected to go beneath the surface -- literally. The next big thing in wearable technology may be a tattoo implanted in the skin, according to Fast Company. The folks at NewDealDesign, the San Francisco-based design company behind the Fitbit Force wellness watch, drafted a mock-up of the  tattoo for Fast Company's Wearables Week. They called it 'Project Underskin.' The foundation of Underskin would be a visible tattoo implanted in the knuckle of the thumb and a larger, invisible tattoo implanted in the palm, according to Fast Company. The tattoo would interact with everything the consumer touches and would recognize the consumer's location as well as movements within the body. The sub-dermal tattoo will run off of the body's electro-chemical energy and will have the ability to monitor blood sugar, exchange information through a simple handshake, unlock front doors, protect credit card information by allowing use only when the card is in the owner's hand, glow when holding hands with a loved one and more, according to Jaeha Yoo, Director of Experience Design at NDD. Two tattoos: The foundation of Underskin would be a visible tattoo implanted in the knuckle of the thumb and a larger, invisible tattoo implanted in the palm . Human: Gadi Amit, the CEO of NDD, said that with the sub-dermal tattoo 'we'll actually become more human and more free' As far as privacy goes, Fast Company reports that the tattoo would encode the consumer's data into a shape specific to that person, like a thumbprint. Gadi Amit, the CEO of NDD, said in a CNet interview that electronics 'will become inherent to our existence,' he used mobile phones as an example and described them as 'the most personal object you have.' 'They won't be gadgets. they'll be who we are and what we are,' Amit told CNet. 'People immediately jump to the conclusion that we’ll be cyborgs. Actually, my goal in designing is that we won’t be cyborgs. We’ll actually become more human and more free from the technology.' Amit told From The Grapevine that Underskin is in the concept stages now and is simply a vision for what Wearables industry will look like in the next five years. There are no prototypes or contracts as of now. Though a sub-dermal tattoo has never been done and marketed, Yoo said that there is a lot of cultural precedent for the idea. “When we started working on it, everyone was a little squeamish about implanting something...' Yoo said, 'Obviously tattoos, piercings--people are implanting birth control. This stuff is going on now. It’s not a huge step forward to implant something like Underskin.' Thumbprint: The tattoo would encode the consumer's data into a shape specific to that person, like a thumbprint. Though the innovators say this new technology will help people become more' human' and 'free,' some have already expressed their concerns about the tattoo. One Tumblr user posted in response to the NDD's unveiling of Underskin and wrote: 'My immediate thought: Employers could brand their employees, with the argument they’ll need a smart tattoo to enter the workplace!' Other comments on the Fast Company's site have included statements like 'It would be misused...' and 'No thanks....a bit too Orwellian for me.' Features: The sub-dermal tattoo will run off of the body's electro-chemical energy and will have the ability to monitor blood sugar, exchange information through a simple handshake, unlock front doors, protect credit card information by allowing use only when the card is in the owner's hand, glow when holding hands with a loved one and more .

Law Enforcement Rangers indicated that Garcia had been in possession of . the burls taken from the site, and then sold them to the shop. The burl . shop was not investigated. Authorities . say unemployment and drug addiction have spurred an increase in the . destructive practice of cutting off the knobby growths at the base of . ancient redwood trees to make decorative pieces like lacey-grained . coffee tables and wall clocks. The . practice — known as burl poaching — has become so prevalent along the . Northern California coast that Redwood National and State Parks now . closes the popular Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway at night in a . desperate attempt to deter thieves. Law . enforcement Ranger Laura Denny said that poachers have been stalking . the remote reaches of the park with their chain saws and ATVs for . decades, but lately the size and frequency of thefts have been on the . rise. Environmental damage: National Park Service Ranger Jeff Denny shows the damage from redwood burl poaching in Orick, California . 'When I interview suspects, that is the (reason) they say: their addiction to drugs and they can't find jobs,' she said. Her husband, park district interpretation supervisor Jeff Denny, said it is comparable to poor people poaching rare rhinos in Africa to sell their horns. Jobs are hard to come by since the timber and commercial fishing industries went into decline. 'Originally there were two million acres of old growth forest that spanned the coast of Northern California from Oregon to Monterey,' he said. 'Over the past 150 years, 95 percent of that original forest has been cut. The only remaining old growth forest in existence now is almost entirely within the Redwood national park' and some state parks. A redwood tree can survive the practice, but the legacy of the organism that could be 1,000 years old is threatened, because the burl is where it sprouts a clone before dying. Magestic: The ancient redwoods in California's Redwood National and State Parks are about 400 feet tall and 1000 years old . Sprouting . from burls is the prevalent method of redwood propagation, and the . source of the Latin name for coast redwood, Sequoia semper vierens, or . forever living, he added. Lorin . Sandberg is a burl dealer in Scio, Oregon. He occasionally goes to . Northern California to buy burl, but it is tough to find any more, with . almost all of the old growth that makes the best burls protected on . public land. The good stuff with a lacey grain full of eyes will go for . $2 to $3 a pound, unseasoned. Finished dining room tables are being offered for $1,300 on eBay. 'I . don't buy them unless they have proof of where they got it,' he said. 'I've got to have a paper trail. If there's not a paper trail, it can . stay in their yard.' With . few law enforcement rangers — and 133,000 acres of park stretching . south from the headquarters in Crescent City, California — to patrol, . arrests are rare, Laura Denny said. She can recall two or three over the . past 12 years. While charges can be felonies carrying prison time, . convictions usually end up as misdemeanors carrying fines.","Danny E Garcia cut burls off redwoods at Redwood National and State Parks in California and sold them to a shop .

"Lottery winner Adrian Bayford has already been bombarded with requests for cash following his huge £148million win - despite being away on holiday with his family. The tiny shop which he jointly runs with his best friend in the Suffolk town of Haverhill has seen dozens of letters pour through its doors since he went public with his huge win on Tuesday. His best friend and business partner Richard Hudspith - who is keeping the Suffolk Music Centre running - said the requests for money had been piling up. Scroll down for video . In demand: Lottery winner Adrian Bayford (pictured with his wife Gillian), has shut his business after he was  bombarded with requests for cash following his huge £148miillion win . Bombarded: They were rumours that the couple were forced to close their music shop (above) because of nuisance and abuse from beggars, but Gillian has denied this was the case . 'Put it this way, there has been more mail than you normally get with your morning coffee,' he said. After winning the Euromillions jackpot, Mr Bayford and his wife Gillian caught an easyJet flight for a short break with their two young children. And . rather than make for the sun and five-star luxury, they appear to have . headed north to spend time at the windswept Scottish caravan park where . Mrs Bayford’s parents live. The manager of the Barry Downs site in . Carnoustie, Angus, said yesterday: 'Yes, they are here but they don’t . want to be disturbed. They are not giving interviews but they are here . on the park.' In business: Mr Bayford with his best friend Richard Hudspith, left, inside the shop . The couple went on the modest break . with their children, Aimee, six, and Cameron, four, after the press . conference on Tuesday where their identities were revealed. Mr . Hudspith, 39, said he had since spoken to Mr Bayford while he is on his . break and said they are trying to let everything sink in. 'They are fine. They just want to have some time with each other and the children and various other members of family. 'They are just trying to let this all sink in and carry on as normal, the children come first for them.' Already the couple have showed signs that there new found vast wealth won't go to their head. In it to win it! Richard Hudspith told the couple to spend their money how they please . The Bayfords flew with easyJet to an undisclosed location in Europe for their first holiday abroad as a family . They queued with other passengers at . Stansted Airport before flying off to their hideaway where they will 'acclimatise' to their newfound wealth. The only nod to luxury was the Air . Harrods helicopter that whisked them from the hotel near Bishop’s . Stortford, Hertfordshire, to the airport four miles away – and that was . paid for by lottery organiser Camelot. Mr Hudspith thinks the couple will continue to keep their feet on the ground. 'I know Camelot do lots to help people who come into large sums of money and I think they are listening to the right sort of advice. 'Obviously it is going to be life-changing for them but as people they will still have the same values and that is that their children will come first. 'They will probably move but I believe they will stay in the area.' Still on a budget: Adrian and Gillian Bayford board a helicopter after it was revealed that they had won £148million on the lottery . Jet-setters: The helicopter took the couple on a four-mile journey to Stansted Airport, where they boarded an easyJet flight with their two children . The gated caravan park where the . Bayfords are staying has a bar, cafe and newsagents, as well as a gym . and hairdresser. An adjoining field has pitches for tents. Entertainment includes pub quizzes and bingo on Friday and Saturday nights. Reviewers on one camping website gave . Barry Downs six out of ten. Highlights are the reasonably-priced cafe, . an entertainer whose ‘singing...was good’ and ‘immaculate’ beaches . nearby. But some complained about showers that . were prone to flooding, toilets that were 'not as clean as they . could’ve been' and a lack of activities for children. Meanwhile back home in Haverhill, . Suffolk, it was business as usual at Suffolk Music Centre, the . secondhand records and musical instruments shop Mr Bayford runs and now . hopes to expand. A steady stream of customers arrived to offer their congratulations after co-owner Richard Hudspith opened up yesterday. The determined show of normality was . confirmed by Mr Bayford’s aunt, Linda Beesley, who said the couple . wanted to shield their children from upheaval after scooping Britain’s . second largest EuroMillions win. Payout: The Bayfords won £148million in August, one of the biggest lottery jackpots in history . 'If they’re going to move house they . will tell the children what’s happening but they won’t explain why. They . will protect them from it,’ the 65-year-old told the Mail yesterday. 'They won’t contaminate them by taking them out shopping and all that rubbish. 'They won’t be spoilt children, I don’t think that for one minute. And if they are then auntie will knock them into shape.’ Mr Hudspith, 38, said the Bayfords spent their last holiday in a caravan in Cornwall. 'Obviously, the amount of money they . have won is life-changing in a huge way but their core values as people . will not change too much,’ he said. 'They always put their children first . and do not have extravagant tastes. I genuinely believe they will be the . same people that they have always been.' PUGH . Mrs Bayford, 40, plans to quit her job . as a healthcare assistant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge but Mr . Bayford, 41, is  expected to carry on working. 'Whether he will want to be here every . day behind the counter is another matter but I am sure he will do at . some point,' Mr Hudspith said. 'They are working people. Having an . interest in something is important. They will not just sit around and do . nothing.' The Bayfords discovered they had been catapulted into 516th place in the Sunday Times Rich List on Saturday night. But their wish list is decidedly . modest. As well as a new home with a high-tech kitchen, Mrs Bayford is . considering buying an Audi Q7 and her husband wants to visit the . Canadian Rockies. They also plan to share their good fortune with a small group of family and friends. And there could be more happiness for . the family after the Mail revealed that Mr Bayford and twin brother . Miles have a half-brother from their father Sidney’s first marriage. The . brothers were aware of Paul Wilson’s existence but had never been in . touch. And Mr Wilson, a 55-year-old college . manager, has had no contact with his father since the 1960s and had no . idea he had remarried and started another family. Miss Beesley yesterday suggested her nephews would 'probably, in time, have a get-together' with their long-lost relative. 'They’re the type of people who might do that,' she said. Mr Wilson, who has insisted he has no . interest in his relative’s fortune, said: 'Thanks to the lottery I have . discovered a whole new branch of my family.'","Dozens of letters have been pouring through the doors of the Suffolk Music Centre since Adrian and Gillian Bayford went public with their £148m win .

"A benefits mother-of-11 infamous for taking her huge brood on foreign holidays has boasted about having £4,000 to splash on Christmas presents. Cheryl Prudham has previously attracted controversy for insisting she's happy to claim state handouts and blaming the welfare system for her large family. She has now revealed that her family's heavily-subsidised income has allowed her to stash away thousands for the festive season. Scroll down for video . Cheryl Prudham, pictured with husband Rob and her family, says she has saved £4,000 from her benefits to spend on Christmas presents for her 11 children . The couple - who this summer took their children to Menorca on holiday - have recently had twin daughters . The 32-year-old, from Gravesend, Kent, says she has saved £350 for each of her youngsters which she plans to spend on lavish gifts. She told Closer magazine: 'I love spoiling them at Christmas - and being on benefits means I can do that. 'I've bought four of then iPad minis, costing £250 each, and the twins will get gold bracelets with their names engraved on them.' In her latest interview, Mrs Prudham also revealed that her benefits help her fund a £30-a-week smoking habit and have paid for the family to redecorate their new five-bedroom council house. Her comments have provoked anger among campaigners, who say state handouts should not fund lavish lifestyles. Andy Silvester, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's not for the state to say how many children anyone should have, but there is a limit to the number of children taxpayers can support. 'Couples up and down the country face tough decisions all the time when they decide if they can afford another child, and those on benefits should be no different.' Mrs Prudham has previously attracted controversy for insisting it was right that taxpayers paid for her holiday . The mother-of-11 says she plans to get iPad minis for four of her children and gold bracelets for the twins . They were moved into a five-bedroom council house after complaining their three-bed home was cramped . Mrs Prudham's husband Rob earns £1,600-a-month as a delivery driver, but their large family means they still get more than £28,000-a-year in benefits and tax credits. The mother-of-11 first attracted criticism for demanding her local council provide her with a bigger council house to give her growing brood more space. The family were then photographed enjoying a two-week holiday in Menorca, which she insisted they 'deserved'. Mrs Prudham had her first son George, 13, when she was just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000. She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight. She then had three unplanned pregnancies; Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four. In March 2009, she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now three. They then had Lenny, now two, before she gave birth to daughter Lainey in January last year. She then had twins Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose this summer. Describing the holiday, she said: 'I asked the school headmaster if we could get time off, but he said 'no'. So we decided to go anyway. One of the weeks was during half term, so they haven't missed that much school' Speaking earlier this year, Mrs Prudham said: 'People criticise me for getting lots of benefits but it's the Government's fault. You're not going to say no to money if it's offered to you'","Cheryl Prudham has attracted criticism for expensive holidays abroad .

"An Australian photographer, who spent nine years trying in vain to photograph Migaloo the albino whale, was finally credited for his long-running persistence on Friday when he captured all 50-tonnes of the amazing animal north of Newcastle. These exclusive pictures of Migaloo, which Daily Mail Australia reported had been spotted in Sydney on Thursday, were taken by veteran photographer Ray Alley off the coast of Nelson Bay in NSW. The all-white Migaloo, who is migrating north for the winter from the cold waters of the Antarctic to the tropical warmth of north Queensland, stopped off for a rare display of showmanship on his way through at Nelson Bay. Among the images Mr Alley took, was a stunning panograph of the beast breaching two-to-three kilometres offshore with his body completely arched out of the water. It was the first time the 54-year-old had boarded a whale watching vessel since giving up on the elusive hunt for Migaloo back in 2009. Scroll down for video . Using a lightning-fast shudder speed Alley captured the panograph of Migaloo breaching out of the water at Nelson Bay, north of Newcastle, on Friday. Still getting over the shock of this amazing image, he told Daily Mail Australia today was the 'holy grail' in his 27-year photographic career: . 'I expected to see him today, because I got the call from one of the guys at Imagine cruises saying 'we've got him'. But to get a full breach, it's kind of like seeing Madonna drop her gear on stage, you really want it to happen but you don't expect it too.' Mr Alley said the image 'eclipses' his previous best photo of three humpback whales breaching off the coast of Nelson Bay back in 2004, known as a triple breach. It was regarded as one of the most amazing photo's at the time, and believed to be perhaps the only image of three humpbacks breaching in the one photo. He said after seeing Migaloo on Friday: 'Mate, I can go to the grave happy now, this is the holy grail for me.' Captured using a lighting-fast shutter speed on his high-powered Nikon camera, Alley shot the incredible panoramic picture of Migaloo's full breach from  his exit out of the water right through to his re-entry. Having toiled hard over the years, including spending six to seven days on whale watching boats during the peak migratory season, Mr Alley said Friday's expedition made the wait for Migaloo all worthwhile. He said it may be something he never gets the chance to replicate again. Photographer Ray Alley said hr had waited 14 years to even see Migaloo, let alone capture the great white whale jumping from the water . At the peak of his career, Alley would spend six or even seven days straight on the boat Imagine trying to get photos of whales during the migratory season . Friday's whale watching exercise was a popular day for Nelson Bay vessels, with all vying for a glimpse of the great white whale in action. Alley put Migaloo's sudden breach, about an hour after tailing him around, down to the departure of a competition cruise boat, Moonshadow Cruises, which turned and headed for shore minutes before Migaloo came up for air. 'He was probably coming up to see where the sound (of the engine) went.' Alley said the sight of Migaloo was something to marvel. 'He is just one of those whales that has a magnificent presence about him.' Migaloo shares his distinguishable albino appearance with just one other white whale in the world, a Norwegian. He was first sighted for the first time this year by a member of the public just off the coast of Green Cape in southern NSW on Tuesday. He was then spotted several times again on Thursday, with camera crews getting magnificent views of the 35-year-old off the coast of Sydney. He was snapped and filmed breaching in waters off Botany Bay, Cronulla and Bondi as Australia's much-loved white whale continued his three-month migratory trip from Antarctica to North Queensland and back. Ray Alley shot this image of three humpback whales breaching out of the water in Nelson Bay back in 2004 . This photograph of a humpack whale taken by Alley, with a distinct marking of a Batman-like logo on it's stomach, featured on the front page of the Daily Mail back in 2008 . Photographer Jonas Liebschner shot this stunning picture of Migaloo as he surfaced near the boat of Whale Watching Sydney at Cronulla in Sydney's south on Thursday afternoon . Migaloo was swimming in a 'competition pod' with four other Humpback whales as they tried to jostle one another for the leading position while heading north through Sydney .

"A young woman is taking the taxidermy craze to the next level... by making stuffed animals wearable. Jo Shears, 31, spends her spare time turning rabbits, mice and birds into hats and handbags. Now she’s making a living from the wacky accessories and has even had orders from brides hoping to walk down the aisle in one of her creations. While it might seem strange to some to have stuffed roadkill perched on your shoulder in a tiny top hat, for some it is the new frontier of fashion . The unusual creations like a raven feathered hat (left) and a winged mouse hair clip (right)  are created by Jo in her studio in Ealing, West London . From the tiny studio in her flat in Ealing, West London, Jo cleans between the spines of hedgehogs and prepares birds of all shapes and sizes to make them into exotic headgear. As part of her attempt to keep her work ethical, the majority of her ‘subjects’ are roadkill - commonly found English animals like foxes and squirrels that have met an untimely death thanks to traffic. But it’s not a quick and easy job - to make a hat can take over a week. This includes the man hours, the tanning process and the drying out time necessary to complete a fancy hat or stole. Far from being reserved for bereaved pet lovers and crazy celebrities, Jo now has commissions from the most unlikely of clientele: brides to be. Each piece requires hours of painstaking work to create, often taking over a week to finish . Jo started collecting taxidermy years before attempting it herself, progressing from mice to large creatures . After floating the idea that a stuffed creature could add that unique twist every couple is looking for, Jo has become a hit at wedding fairs. She has made headpieces from birds and buttonholes from furs. One bride has asked her to make her a handbag for the day of her wedding from a cat. Even grooms are getting in on the act - she recently completed a necklace made from a raven skull, alongside a whole stuffed raven, for one male customer. Despite working in marketing, Jo is hoping to take her taxidermy full-time as soon as she gets the chance. Jo said: 'As a child I spent lots of my time pressed up against the glass at museums looking at stuffed animals. A taxidermy hat or head piece can require days of tanning and drying out on top of the hours of craftsmanship . Surprisingly Jo's work has caused her to become a favorite at wedding fairs, as couples search for that 'something different' for their big day . 'I’d always been a little macabre but about four years ago I started collecting taxidermy properly. 'I lived in Japan for a couple of years and when I came back I decided to give it a go myself. 'I just bought a frozen mouse from the vet and tried it out. 'I joined the UK guild of taxidermists after that and it’s been growing since then. 'Last year I set up commercially and it’s really taken off. Jo hopes the success of her business means she will soon be able to do taxidermy full time . Most pieces are made from roadkill - commonly found English animals like foxes and squirrels that have met an untimely death thanks to traffic . 'Because of the massive resurgence in interest in taxidermy my work is in demand. 'But it’s much more difficult than it looks. People who do a three-hour mouse stuffing class and think that they’ll be able to go off and do it at home are mistaken. It takes a lot of training. 'The results of my first mouse were pretty terrible but it’s a life-long learning experience. 'If there’s something really tricky I have to keep putting it back in the freezer to give my brain a break. 'Now I specialise in wearable taxidermy. It’s mainly a lot of hats but I do all sorts of things. But I try to keep it ethical by mainly using roadkill. 'The reaction has been pretty mixed: some people think it’s wonderful and are desperate to order. 'Others think it’s disgusting or just can’t see how it will fit into their special day, let alone their own wardrobe.'","Jo started taxidermy as a hobby but went commercial last year .

"Two teenage boys planning to change their identities that fled to an unknown destination in a Mercedes Benz after leaving notes for their parents saying they are 'sorry' and 'starting new lives' have been found safe in Colorado. The parents of Jordan Webb, 16, and Levi 'David' Briggs, 15, had launched a frantic search for their sons, who they say fled from Avon, Indiana in the early hours of Saturday morning. The boys' families told RTV6 that the teens were found at the home of a camp friend in Loma, Colorado and were safely with police. Missing: Jordan Webb, left, and David Briggs, right, fled their parents' homes in Avon, Indiana with plans of changing their identities. They were found in Colorado . They vanished after enjoying dinner . on Friday night with Jordan's father, Russell, and had plans for the . following day. But when Russell awoke, he found the boys - and his car - . missing. The boys - neither of whom has a driving license - were believed to have taken off in the 2006 black Mercedes C350 . at around 1 a.m. with clothes and backpacking equipment. While their parents have not released details about what might have sparked their disappearances, Jordan's sister suggested her 'worldly' brother was frustrated in the small town. Authorities issued a nationwide alert seeking Jordan and David, while the families set up Facebook and Twitter pages urging their sons to return. On the pages, they said they believe the boys had taken off for Colorado or New York City with 'plans of changing their identities'. Parents of the boys' friends agreed on Facebook that 'the word around school' was that the teenagers are going to New York. The teenagers, who attend the same school, both got rid of their mobile phones and shut down their Facebook accounts, their parents said. New life: Jordan, left, and David, right, left their parents notes apologising for their 'bizarre' behaviour . Getaway vehicle: Even though neither of the boys have driving licenses, they left in Jordan's father's 2006 black Mercedes C350, which has not been found . They added that, while the boys could . be travelling in the Mercedes, there is also the possibility they were . traveling by air, bus or train. It is not known how much money the boys . took with them. Jordan's mother told CNHI her son had written a letter in which he said he knew leaving . was 'bizarre' but added that they planned to settle somewhere for a long . time. Jordan's sister, Jennifer, added to . CNHI: 'We’re all very close. He stayed with me last weekend and seemed . totally normal. Nothing seemed to be bothering him. We have a very close . relationship. 'He’s very . intelligent and worldly and I think Avon might not be his cup of tea. But we've always told him you can't pick where you go to high school, . while you can pick any college you want.' In a touching post on Facebook, David's father Paul appealed for his son to return home  - although neither of the families would go into detail about what sparked the boys' disappearances. Missed: Jordan's parents said their son left without his glasses and the . boys may change their appearances . 'Intelligent': His sister, left, described him as 'wordly' and said he may have been frustrated in Avon . ''Our world is upside down . without you,' he wrote. 'We're not getting much sleep because we're always thinking . about you. Come home. We'll get through whatever we have to, to get you . back on track with a good future. You are worth it. I miss your guitar playing. I look at . the piano and can hear you playing in my pleasant memories of you. There . are many more great memories to make. There isn't any valid reason you . cannot come home. I love you. Dad.' The Webbs added: 'Jordan is loved and . missed by his family and friends. We cannot imagine life without our . son, and we will not stop looking until he's home safe, no matter how . long it takes.' Authorities were following leads of possible sightings and were interviewing friends of the boys in hope of finding out their destination, Avon police chief Jack Miller told ABC News. 'One of the unique things about this is . that these kids come from good homes, with loving parents, they mention . in their notes that they love their parents, they were good in school, . popular, there were no red flags,' he said. Have you seen them? Police have sent a nationwide alert to look for the boys . 'The boys each left a . note and the notes basically said the same thing, that they were going . to take this opportunity to strike out on their own.' He added that the community had come together to try to locate the boys. 'We want the boys to know they are not . in any kind of trouble. The police are involved not because of any crime . but to facilitate their return home to their parents,' he said. Webb is white, 6 feet . tall, with light brown hair and blue eyes, while Briggs is described as . white, 5 feet10 inches tall, with blonde hair and blue eyes.

"The full horrific scale of the threat to our wildlife from the plastic rubbish polluting our seas has been exposed in a landmark study. It found that nearly 400 marine species are at risk as a result of the tons of shopping bags, fishing nets and other waste dumped in the oceans each year. Puffins, turtles, seals and whales are among the creatures that have swallowed or become entangled in plastic bags. Killed by plastic: A razorbill washed up on a beach entangled in waste that was dumped at sea . Saved: A turtle trapped in netting. But some of the most vulnerable animals on the planet are threatened by the tonnes of rubbish in our seas . Victim: Gull trapped in a plastic ring. The full horrific scale of the threat to our wildlife from the plastic rubbish polluting our seas has been exposed in a landmark study . The most comprehensive impact study in nearly two decades found many of the world’s most endangered marine species are now threatened. Hawaiian monk seals, North Atlantic right whales, African penguins and loggerhead turtles have all become caught up in fishing lines, choked on plastic bags or swallowed bottle tops. The problem has increased by nearly 50 per cent since the previous study was carried out in 1997, British scientists said last night. Separate research published last week revealed that so much plastic is dumped into the sea each year that it would fill five carrier bags for every foot of coastline on the planet. The Daily Mail has been campaigning since 2008 for tougher action to reduce the problem. In a major victory last year, it was announced that supermarkets and large stores in England will charge 5p per plastic bag from October. The move is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £100million a year for good causes. In the new study, biologists at Plymouth University scoured records going back to the 1960s, and found scientific records of 395 species which had ingested or become entangled in rubbish. Since the 1960s, nearly 400 marine species are recorded as having swallowed or become entangled in plastic and glass waste. Of those, 67 are on the Red List of threatened and endangered species. These include Hawaiian monk seals (left), African penguins (right) and loggerhead sea turtles . Biologists at Plymouth University scoured records going back to the 1960s, and found scientific evidence of 395 species which had ingested or become entangled in rubbish (stock image). A further 300 species were seen living with debris, either making their nests out of rubbish or swimming among trash on the seabed . Last year, horrific pictures of an albatross chick, dead on a beach in the north Pacific, revealed the scale of the global problem (pictured). Laysan Albatrosses nesting in Midway Atoll often mistake floating plastic for food and bring it back for their chicks who die eating it . Of these, 67 are on the international Red List of threatened and endangered animals. A further 300 species were seen living with debris, either making their nests out of plastic rubbish or swimming among trash on the seabed. Plastic accounted for nearly 92 per cent of cases, according to the paper published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin. The Daily Mail has been campaigning since 2008 to for tougher action to reduce plastic bag waste. A major victory came in June last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in England. The charge, which will be introduced by October, is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £100million a year for good causes. Co-author Professor Richard Thompson, one of the world’s leading experts on plastic in the marine environment, said the findings bolster evidence that our throwaway society could be driving some species towards extinction. He told the Daily Mail last night: ‘I am not anti-plastic – it has huge benefits. But we need to learn to realise those benefits without creating mountains of debris. ‘We need to try to reverse this trend – it is going to take several decades to do this, but it is possible.’ The study reports that global production of plastic increased from five million tons per year in the 1960s to 280million tons in 2011. It added: ‘It is evident that despite efforts to remove debris from the marine environment, and restrictions on dumping at sea, quantities of plastic are increasing in some locations.’ The increase in dumped plastic seems to be having a direct effect on marine animals. When US ecologist David Laist last looked at the problem 18 years ago, 267 species were recorded as having swallowed or become entangled in rubbish. Now that figure has risen by 49 per cent. Not all incidents led to death –only 4 per cent of cases of plastic ingestion, for example. Around 8 million tonnes of plastic bottles, bags, toys and other plastic rubbish ends up in the world’s oceans each year, according to a separate study by the University of Georgie. The total is much higher than previous estimates and enough to leave an area around 25 times the size of Manchester ankle-deep in plastic waste . But the scientists said it is likely that plastic caused unrecorded injuries other than death, and further research is needed to build a clearer picture of the damage this pollution is causing. Sarah Gall, who co-wrote the study, said: ‘We found that all known species of sea turtle, and more than half of all species of marine mammal and seabird had been affected by marine debris. ‘In nearly 80 per cent of entanglement cases, this had resulted in direct harm or death.’ So much plastic is dumped into the sea each year that it would fill five carrier bags for every foot of coastline on the planet, scientists have warned. Around 8 million tonnes of plastic bottles, bags, toys and other plastic rubbish ends up in the world’s oceans each year. The ‘staggering’ total is much higher than previous estimates - and enough to leave an area around 25 times the size of Manchester ankle-deep in plastic waste. Because of the difficulties in working out the exact amount, since much of it may have sunk, the scientists said the true figure could be as much as 12.7 million tons polluting the ocean each year. Dr Jenna Jambeck, one of the researchers from the University of Georgia in the US, said we are becoming ‘overwhelmed by our waste’.","Biologists studied scientific records dating back to the 1960s .
They found 395 species had ingested or become entangled in rubbish .
Species mentioned include puffins, turtles, seals, whales and penguins .
Of those, 67 are on the Red List of threatened and endangered species .
A further 300 species were seen living with debris or swimming in trash .
Plastic accounted for nearly 92% of cases, according to the study ."
"A breakthrough in genetic science could pave the way for the developments of drugs for asthma and other allergies. Scientists have discovered 34 genes that predispose people to allergies, which could become targets for new drugs. Asthma affects one in ten children in the UK, and allergies are thought to afflict a third of the population. Scientists have discovered 34 genes that predispose people to allergies, which could become targets for new drugs. It could pave the way for new treatments for asthma, which affects one in ten UK children (file picture) This new study, led by scientists at Imperial College London over the last decade, used new ways to study the genes in the immune system. Scientists pinpointed genes which regulate an antibody involved in triggering allergic responses. Although the antibody, called immunoglobin E, was already well known, the genes that control it had never been identified. The discovery creates the process of switching off these genes using drugs. Professor William Cookson, from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, said: ‘Our pioneering approach allowed us to obtain insights that we weren’t able to get from traditional genetics. ‘It isn’t just the genetic code that can influence disease and DNA sequencing can only take you so far. ‘Our study shows that modifications on top of the DNA that control how genes are read may be even more important.” The research, published in the journal Nature, focused on genes that are altered by an environmentally-triggered process called methylation, which switches them off. The study, led by scientists at Imperial College London (pictured), used new ways to study the genes in the immune system and scientists pinpointed those which regulate an antibody involved in triggering allergies . White blood cells from British families affected by asthma were analysed to compare levels of methylation with the amount of the antibody in the blood. The scientists found strong associations between the antibody and low methylation rates in 34 genes. Tests confirmed that all 34 genes were most active in asthmatics with high levels of the antibody. If the genes can be switched on using drugs, the antibody levels could be reduced and allergies effectively treated. Dr Samantha Walker, director of research at Asthma UK, said: ‘We welcome this research which explores the genetic relationship between allergies and asthma which could bring us one step closer to developing ground-breaking asthma treatments and finding a cure.’","Scientists have discovered 34 genes that predispose people to allergies .

"A triple amputee who had both legs cut off has been threatened with having his benefits stopped - unless he can prove he is disabled. Devastated Chris Cann, 57, was left wheelchair bound after losing both legs and four fingers to diabetes. Despite being housebound, the widower, from Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent has now been ordered to undergo medical tests to prove he is too disabled to work or his £600-a-month benefits will be stopped. Triple amputee Chris Cann has been told he has to prove he is disabled or risk having his benefits stopped . Chris, who developed diabetes six years ago, started claiming disability allowance in 2008 - before he had his legs amputated. He now has chronic arthritis in both hands and is also struggling to come to terms with the death of his wife of 11 years, Emma Wilson, earlier this month. Two years ago he had his right leg amputated below the knee and in January this year Chris had surgery again to have his left leg removed as well as four fingers on his right hand. This week Chris received a letter . from the Department of Work and Pensions ordering him to undergo medical . tests to prove he should receive the new Employment and Support . Allowance. He said  'It . seems a pointless task to me because I am already classed as a triple . amputee by social services. It is a waste of time. 'Four years ago I was unfit to work and my health has deteriorated a lot since then. Even if I could get down there they will take one look at me and say I am unfit for work. Chris Cann has been left housebound after losing both legs above the knee and four fingers to diabetes . 'I am very obviously disabled so I don’t see what tests they have to do. 'I am housebound and on my own. 'They expect me to get a taxi which will cost me £10 each way but I can’t really do that without help. 'I can’t even get upstairs to turn the heating on so how do they expect me to go to all these places? 'If they insist I need these tests, then at least they could do them at my home. 'I do try to take things as they come but it has been a very hard time for me with losing my legs.' Chris gave up his job as a catering manager in 2008 after being diagnosed with diabetes. He'd spent 30 years working in the fast food industry. He underwent an assessment which ruled he was too disabled to work and he began receiving benefits. But after new rules were introduced to tighten up the benefits system he has been told to prove he cannot work under the Department for Work and Pension’s Work Capability Assessment measures. A DWP spokesman said: 'The old system simply wrote too many people off without looking at what they were able to do. 'If someone can no longer do the job they used to do, the Work Capability Assessment looks at what other kinds of work they may be able to do.' A spokesman for Atos Healthcare said: 'We are happy to provide home visits to those who are unable to leave their home. 'These are based on an individual's personal circumstances.'","Widower had both legs and four fingers amputated .

"University footballers have been banned from wearing their kit - after getting it sponsored by the world's third-biggest porn site. The players in Canterbury, Kent, had joked online about Pornhub sponsoring Rutherford Raiders, a team named after the father of nuclear physics Ernest Rutherford which plays twice a week. To their surprise the site got in touch to volunteer its cash - and kitted them out with branded orange and black shirts along with much-needed shorts and socks. Banned: Footballers at the University of Kent in Canterbury have been prohibited from wearing their 'totally inappropriate' kit (pictured) after getting it sponsored by the world's third-biggest porn site, Pornhub . But the move did not stand up to scrutiny by academic chiefs, who had a stern word with the students days later and banned them from wearing their new kit. One team member told student news website The Tab: 'We are struggling to see why they are having a problem. The university cricket team are sponsored by Kingfisher which is also a age restricted product. 'The university rugby team once had training shirts with ‘80 minutes, 15 positions, no protection, wanna ruck? 'In my opinion the decision is made by people that are out of touch with what’s socially acceptable. 'It’s hard for football teams to find a sponsor. I personally haven’t come across anyone yet that has found it anything other than funny.' Not impressed: A spokesman for the university (pictured) said the shirts will not be allowed to be worn . University spokesman Martin Herrema, however, said: 'The University of Kent sports department would never sanction sponsorship of this type - it is totally inappropriate. 'The team has been spoken with and will not be allowed to wear the shirts in question at any time. 'We take this issue very seriously and inter-college sports teams, which are the responsibility of Kent Sport, must present any potential sponsorship and/or logos for approval.' Kent's student union and feminist society did not immediately return requests for comment. Pornhub is the world's 77th-most visited website and third most popular porn website, according to traffic ranking site Alexa. It claimed to have 14.7billion visitors last year - 1.68million per hour - and 63.2billion video views. The row comes weeks after the men's rugby club at London School of Economics - one of the world's top universities - was banned from playing for a year after handing out a sexist leaflet to first-year students. Scattered throughout the printed leaflets were demeaning references to 'Poly' students, from supposedly inferior former Polytechnics which have since become other universities. They also described women as 'tasty', 'beast-like' and 'mingers', suggesting they only wanted to play sport so they could go drinking with men. Initiations, the booklets suggested, would not tolerate 'Poly activities that involve faeces, genitalia, and outright homosexual debauchery'. Another section suggested a committee member embodied everything the club holds dear - 'debauchery, hedonism and misogyny'. Members of the club were encouraged to bring two bottles of wine each to a Friday night social, or three if they are 'Russian'. Furore: The incident comes weeks after LSE men's rugby club was banned for giving this leaflet to freshers . Last month a survey claimed a third of women have been victims of university 'lad culture'. The study was commissioned by the National Union of Students, which accused university authorities of not doing enough to stop young women suffering inappropriate behaviour. The move prompted amused reactions when it emerged online. Canterbury resident Tom Hendry, 42, said: 'If they could score on the pitch as often as they score on Pornhub, they’d be challenging for the Premiership.' The ban has left the Raiders sponsorless just a year after they won the University of Kent's intercollege league. But as one online commenter observed: 'I imagine they will come first this year too.'","University of Kent footballers jokingly said Pornhub was their sponsor .

"'Suicide': Izzy Dix, 14, who died after months of abuse at the hands of internet trolls on Ask.fm. Her mother has launched a petition to get the site shutdown . The mother of a teenage girl who was driven to suicide by internet trolls and school bullies has urged the public to help her close down controversial website Ask.fm. Izzy Dix, 14, was found hanged at her home after suffering months of vile taunts, insults and cruel remarks . The schoolgirl wrote a heartbreaking poem about bullying months before she died in September. Her family say she took her life after struggling to cope with the abuse - much of which came via Latvian-based Ask.fm. Izzy’s mother Gabbi, of Brixham, Devon, has already got 11,000 signatures on her online petition calling on the government to outlaw the site. Speaking at the start of Anti-Bullying Week, Gabbi urged more parents to sign up before another child succumbs to the 'relentless' pressure of bullying. She said: 'Izzy was bullied at school and in the community over a period of about 18 months. 'She would be relieved to get home from school but then the abuse continued online. Bullying is relentless these days - there is no break from it. 'We closed down Izzy’s Ask.fm account but a piece of her had already been chipped away.' Ask.fm, which has more than 70 million registered users worldwide, allows anyone to post anonymous questions and comments on to a person’s profile. It has been heavily criticised for its lack of regulation and incidents of cyberbullying and been linked to the suicides of 12 young people around the world in just over a year. Gabbi wants it to be closed down as part of a wave of policies designed to keep young people safe online. Izzy's heartbreaking poem about bullying was published by her mother in the wake of her death in an attempt to help people understand the pain and suffering caused by bullying. It was read out at the schoolgirl’s funeral where it reduced many mourners to tears. Called I Give Up, it reads: ‘They begin to tell me that nobody wants me there. They tell me to leave and that I am not wanted. Heartbreak: Izzy's mother Gabbi, seen here kisses her child, has launched a campaign to get Ask.fm closed . Sympathies: Floral tributes were left outside Izzy Dix's home in Brixham, Devon after her death in September . ‘I look down and walk, my eyes drowning in a sea of emotion. Another piece of me chiselled away by their cruel remarks and perceptions. I give up.’ Mrs Dix said she decided to publish it to help people understand the pain and suffering caused by bullying and abuse on social media sites. Family friend Maddie Sinclair added: 'We are all devastated by what has happened and so utterly determined to help young people in Izzy’s memory. Moving: Gabbi and Izzy embrace. Mrs Dix said that Ask.fm should be shutdown after it was linked to 12 deaths in the last year . 'Research has shown that almost seven out of ten children in the UK have been bullied at some point. That figure is just horrific and we need to do something about it now.' A study published Monday to mark the beginning of Anti-Bullying Week found that just one in 10 parents believe their children are safe online. Police are not treating Izzy’s September 17 death as suspicious and an inquest will be held at a later date. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'Owners and operators of these sites must take more responsibility or risk facing users and advertisers boycotting them. 'The Prime Minister has set out a series of measures to both keep children safe online and to prevent access to images of child abuse and we have seen progress, as set out at yesterday’s summit. 'More generally, we have given almost £3million to Beatbullying, the Diana Award, Kidscape and the National Children's Bureau to provide state-of-the-art anti-cyberbullying materials for schools and we have introduced staying safe online into the new curriculum from the age of five. 'In the new year, industry will launch a major new national campaign that will speak directly to parents about how to keep their children safe online and how to talk to their children about dangers like sexting and online bullying.' A spokesman for Ask.fm has not yet responded to a request for comment. Gabbi’s petition to close down Ask.fm is online here.

"Bereaved loved ones of the deceased looking for a unique take on the classic funeral service are increasingly taking advantage of showmen pallbearers who march, dance and twirl the casket toward its final resting place. These lively professionals lend a decided different air to the traditionally somber ceremony, but they could come at a steep price. While some funeral homes offer the service, which is more common in the American South, free with a funeral, others charge as much as $1,400 a show. Scroll down for video . Lively: Bereaved loved ones of the deceased looking for a unique take on the classic funeral service are increasingly taking advantage of something unique--dancing pallbearers . Stepping it up: The pallbearers in this show march in, wearing all white, and approach the casket in a synchronized dance . Can be pricey: The unique show is offered free of charge at some funeral homes, but others charge upwards of $1,500 . John B. Houston funeral homes in New Jersey and New York have been offering the unique services, in which eight impeccably dressed gentleman synchronize movements like spinning around with the casket on their shoulders, since 2010. That's when owner John Houston witnessed the spectacle at legendary performer Lena Horne's funeral. 'It’s show business,' Houston told ABC News. The Alabama native said he was accustomed to the showier funerals of the South and looked to his gym trainer to help him recruit some strong-armed gentlemen to become his home's 'White Glove' pallbearers. The White Glove service is now a staple at his homes, where around 1 in 10 'upper echelon' clients request it. Showmen: The mourners may even give the dancers a round of applause, like this group did as the dancers bowed to the deceased . Final resting place: The men take the body to the hearse and depending on the ceremony will do their choreography once more as they carry the casket to its grave . 'They raise the casket, basically shoulder it at the end of the service from the top of the church down the aisle, and put the body in the hearse,' said owner john Houston. 'Then they accompany the hearse, walking. Then, depending on the service, they may do the same thing at the cemetery, shoulder the casket to the grave.' The pallbearers often dance in unison to gospel music, with one of them men leading as a sort of 'drillmaster.' Houston told ABC that the service is offered to everyone, but that it's African Americans who generally opt for it.","The bereaved may now pay for livelier last rites that include choreographed exits for the casket .

"Any fan of Dr Who knows the most astonishing thing about the Tardis (apart from its ability to travel through space and time) is that it's bigger on the inside. Now one imaginative fan has created his own DIY Tardis with this amazing feature, thanks to the nifty use of augmented reality (AR). Greg Kumparak, based in silicon valley in California, first set out to build a simple model of the famous police box after becoming bored over Thanksgiving. Scroll down for the video . Innovative: Mr Kumparak used an augmented reality app to make his model Tardis appear bigger on the inside when pointing his smartphone at it . The technology wizard removed the front door of his mini Tardis and replaced it with patterned material, to allow smartphone software to latch on to the model . He created it over a few hours using wood, two bottles and some dark blue paint, before fixing a working red light on the top. 'Then my stupid brain went and thought 'Hey wouldn't it be cool if it had an interior,' Mr Kumparak wrote on his blog. But how to defy the laws of physics and make it bigger on the inside? First he created a 3D computer model of the interior using a free-to-use open source computer software programme called Blender. He said it was a rough likeness to how it appeared during David Tennant's turn as the Time Lord from 2005 to 2010. The former Techcrunch mobile editor then used the Unity graphics rendering engine. Rendering is the process of generating a 2D image from a 3D model stored in a scene file by using a computer program. This information describes the geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting and shading of the virtual scene. Augmented reality: When the phone moves around the blue box, the virtual image changes to reflect this . The interior if the TARDIS is the same as the one featured during David Tennant's time as the Doctor. Here he's pictured with Freema Agyeman who played Martha Jones . Finally he used an AR app platform by chip-maker Qualcomm called Vuforia, to allow a smartphone to interact with the mini Tardis. For this to work the smartphone software needed to latch on to part of the model so it could map out an appropriate view of the interior. Mr Kumparak tried to use the 'Free for use of Public' sign on the front as the marker but found it was too small. In the end he took off the front door and replaced it with a piece of material with a 'time-warp' style black and white pattern. The software then used this to work out at what angle the interior image should be shown. The result, as his YouTube video shows, is an impressive optical illusion. Reaction to the invention online has been extremely favourable, with one fan even claiming Mr Kumparak had made his Christmas. 'The feedback has been resoundingly positive so far,' Mr Kumparak told the BBC. 'Almost shockingly so, really. Doctor Who fans might be some of the nicest people on the internet.'","Former TechCrunch editor created police box out of bottles and wood .

"Thai police have taken the term gun dog to a whole new level - with barking mad results. Not only has this Labrador been trained to serve with the Thailand police force, it has also been entrusted with its very own weapon. The animal was seen carrying the automatic in a holster strapped to its side. Put your paws up! This dog must feel like the leader of the pack with a gun strapped to its side . And its master was even happy to pose with the gun-toting animal. Witnesses said the armed dog guarded officers as they ate their dinner at the Dusit Hotel in Pattaya, Thailand, on Tuesday. The Labrador certainly looked happy to have risen to such a position of responsibility within the force. And to prove he had the right to carry arms, the dog's holster was marked 'Police K-9'. Since the photographs emerged online, many people have raised concerns about the safety of the bizarre scene. Which one's in charge? A policeman, who appears unarmed, stands alongside his gun-toting Labrador . However, others questioned whether it was simply a stunt for the camera. Navies, military forces and police forces tend to use Labradors as detection dogs thanks to their calm temperament and keen sense of smell. Their sense of smell allows them to home in on almost any scent and follow the path of its origin. The high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who helped save his master Allen Parton's life in 2001 after he had been knocked from his wheelchair by a car. He was voted Dog of the Millennium and given the PDSA's coveted Gold Medal - the canine equivalent of the George Cross - for dragging Mr Parton into the recovery position, pulling a blanket over him and running to a hotel barking for help.",The gun-toting police dog was pictured with an officer at a Pattaya hotel .
"More than $11,000 (£7,000) has been raised by a crowdfunding website for a Vietnamese tourist who endured humiliation at the hands of shop staff after they tried to charge him £940 on an iPhone 6. Pham Van Thoai had saved up for months to buy the phone for his girlfriend and went to the notorious Sim Lim Square to make his purchase. However, when he went into the Mobile Air shop, he was told the original deal of $950 (£595) had now become $1,500 (£940) due to the addition of an extended warranty. Pham Van Thoai is crying and begging shop staff for a full refund after he was told his price to pay was being increased significantly for the iPhone 6 . Pham Van Thoa was distraught when he was presented a bill for an iPhone that was much higher than planned . Believing the warranty to be complimentary, he agreed, only to be told the higher price and that he had no option but to take it. When he instead asked for a refund, it was refused, even when he cried and got down on his knees to beg for his money back - with one person filming the scene. Since the video of Mr Pham, believed to earn $200 (£125) a month as a factory worker, was posted online, donations have come in from all over the world. People touched by his plight have raised $11,713 (£7,340) on a crowdfunding website. Pham Van Thoai is pictured crying and begging shop staff after being duped for iPhone .

"A madcap decorator has painted a baseball every day for 34 years to create the world's - largest ball of paint. Dedicated Michael Carmichael, 64, has plastered a new coat daily since embarking on the bizarre project in 1960s. He has plastered an incredible 22,894 coats of paint to create the mammoth ball - which now weighs a staggering 3,500lbs (1587kg) Laying it on thick: Michael Carmichael applies the 22539th coat of paint to a giant baseball at his home in Alexandria, Indiana . The ball is now a whopping 22.48 inches in diameter (70.58 inch circumference) and is officially recognised by the Guinness World Records as the biggest ever recorded. It is now so large that it requires re-enforced metal rods to suspend it from the roof of Michaels' shed - which he custom-built 15 years ago to house the behemoth. He set up a website highlighting the attraction and now people travel from all over the world to visit Michael and add a coat, which is painstakingly documented in a ledger at home. Speaking yesterday, Michael said: 'It started as a relatively simple project and a bit of fun. But I just kept on painting and painting and painting. And before I knew it, it was enormous. How it all began: The first coat of paint is applied to Michael Carmichael's baseball by his son Mike Jr in 1977 . 'Then I didn't want to stop. I moved it out the garage a good few years ago after it outgrew it and now it has it's own special shed. 'People come from all over the world to add a coat. Sometimes I can add up to ten coats a day if the weather is dry, but we've added at least one every day.' Grandfather-of-six Michael, who lives in Alexandria in the US state of Indiana with wife Glenda, 61, said that he first produced a ball by accident in 60s, but he embarked on the bizarre project in January 1977. Painter and decorator Michael estimates he has spent thousands of dollars daubing the baseball, which was a mere 2.86 inches in diameter (nine inches circumference) when he started. His son Mike Jr applied the first coat with a paint brush, but Michael now requires a roller due to the sheer size. Landmark: The 1500th coat of paint is applied to the ball. The only rule is that each new coat has to be a different colour to the one before it . Getting bigger: The 13,300th coat of paint is applied to ball. Visitors have flocked from around the world to add new coats of paint . Michael added: 'People come from far and wide to see it and add their own coat. 'I've got to met some really interesting people as a result and always thank them and take their picture. 'I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do with it but have no plans to stop painting it. 'My grandchildren have expressed an interest in it so maybe it could become a family heirloom.' Michael said that he began his first paintball in the 60s when on a summer vacation he was working at a local paint store and was throwing a baseball. 'It knocked over a gallon of paint and the ball was covered,' he added. 'We cleaned up the paint up from the floor but left the ball as it was, with paint on it. I set it on top an old table, and the next day I went to get it I was sparked with the idea.' Michael  then wrapped a wire around the ball and dipped it in a gallon of paint and repeated the process. When he got to 1,000 coats he donated to a children's home . Michael added: 'After several years I knew that someday I wanted to start another one and in 1977, my wife Glenda, and I had started another baseball. 'On January 1, 1977 I let my son at the age of three put the very first coat of blue paint on the ball. 'We painted the ball many times a day, while the ball was little and easy to handle and Glenda painted the ball several times a day while I was working; I painted it in the evenings and on the weekends. 'After a while, it became a piece of artwork and we rather enjoyed showing it off and now it's become an attraction that people love to come and see.'",Decorator Michael Carmichael will hand down ball as a a family heirloom .
"With a July due date, the Duchess of Cambridge is going to have to become a dab hand at dressing her bump for summer.  And she made a fine start last night with her first true maternity dress. Kate was the epitome of elegance in pregnancy in a bespoke powder blue 50s style Emilia Wickstead cocktail dress to an engagement at the National Portrait Gallery. She also sported an impressively high pair of grey suede Rupert Sanderson heels and had her hair curled and swept partly back from her face. Scroll down for video . Maternity chic: Kate's bump was more visible as she stepped out at the National Portrait Gallery this evening wearing a bespoke Emilia Wickstead dress and grey Rupert Sanderson shoes . Worthy cause: Kate was at the National Portrait Gallery to celebrate the work of The Art Room charity, which helps children experiencing emotional and behavioural difficulties . Main attraction: Kate drew a huge crowd outside the gallery . Designer style: The Duchess' dress was by Emilia Wickstead, one of her favourite designers, and had a daring low back . Waving to the crowds: The Duchess accessorised with diamond drop earrings . Kate's small baby bump looked more . obvious than ever in the stunning gown, which had a demure neckline but . was daringly low at the back. The Duchess was attending the event to . celebrate the work of The Art Room, one of the first charities she took . on as a working royal. It helps school children - largely in . deprived areas - to increase their self-esteem, self-confidence and . independence through drawing, painting and modelling. Last night was the launch of their Pledge for the Future appeal and a celebration to mark their 11th anniversary. Baby bump: Despite having kept her blossoming figure underwraps for the first part of her pregnancy, Kate looked entirely at ease with her changing shape last night . Smiling: The duchess, who studied history of art at university, was in her element at the gallery . Is the baby kicking? The Duchess pulled an unusual face as she stepped out of the car . I recognise those chaps! The duchess admires Nicky Philipps' double portrait of William and Harry, commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery and put on show for the first time in 2010 . The Duchess took  time to meet with . some of the children who have benefited from charity's help as well as . the staff who work with them.

"Tory MP Brooks Newmark said the benefits cap should be reduced to the value of the average £26,000 salary after tax - equal to just over £20,000 . No one should be allowed to claim more than £20,000 a year in benefits, an influential group of Tory MPs said yesterday. Members of the Free Enterprise Group of Conservative MPs issued a unanimous call for the flagship welfare cap to be reduced from its current level of £26,000. MPs said it would help raise cash to pay for middle-class tax cuts, as well as sending out a powerful message that the unemployed should not be able to live a comfortable life on benefits. Tory MP Brooks Newmark said the cap should be reduced to the value of the average £26,000 salary after tax - equal to just over £20,000. Mr Newmark said: ‘Many hard-working people in my constituency do not understand why we have a welfare cap that allows people to get £26,000 effectively post-tax. That is equal to an income of £35,000 pre-tax. ‘If we want tax cuts elsewhere we should lower the welfare cap to something more reasonable. For people who are fit and able to work they should be able to get no more than the equivalent of £26,000 post-tax.’ Fellow Tory David Ruffley said private polling conducted on behalf of Number 10 showed that the benefit cap was supported by about 80 per cent of the public. But he said 80 per cent of those backing it also thought it was too high. Mr Ruffley said: ‘Most people think it is way too high - we should cut it to £20,000.’ The Free Enterprise Group, whose members include a number of rising Tory stars, was founded by education minister Elizabeth Truss and is backed by a number of other senior figures, including Treasury minister Sajid Javid and business minister Matthew Hancock. The call came as the group urged George Osborne to bring forward a string of tax cuts to ease the pressure on middle class families and small businesses. The Free Enterprise Group also wants the starting point for paying 40 per cent tax to be raised to £50,000 . MPs said the Government had gone far enough on raising the personal allowance for basic rate taxpayers and should now target measures at helping those on middle incomes. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘We’ve done a good job lifting the lowest paid out of tax, but the middle classes have been hit for six.' Proposals included scrapping stamp duty on all homes worth less than £500,000, abolishing Air Passenger Duty and getting rid of so-called ‘green taxes’ costing almost £3 billion a year. The group also wants the starting point for paying 40 per cent tax to be raised from £41,450 to £50,000. The group was founded by education minister Elizabeth Truss and is backed by a number of other senior figures . The proposals highlight Coalition tensions with the Liberal Democrats, who want to focus resources on further increases in the personal tax allowance. However, the group sparked controversy by calling for the introduction of a single rate of VAT at 15 per cent. Tory MP Kwasi Kwarteng, who devised the proposal, said it would lead to a fall in the price of most goods and services which currently attract VAT at 20 per cent. But he acknowledged it would also mean an increase in VAT on domestic fuel from eight per cent to 15, along with the introduction of VAT on food and children’s clothes, which are currently zero-rated. Mr Kwarteng said: ‘It would be controversial to abolish zero-rate VAT, but in the round consumers would benefit greatly.’ He said the Government should have stood firm against the ‘schoolboyish’ campaign last year against Mr Osborne’s bid to put VAT on hot pasties. But, speaking at the launch of a policy paper yesterday, Mr Newmark issued a warning over the plan, describing it as politically ‘toxic’. Labour said the ‘shocking’ proposal would heap costs on millions of families and raise average energy bills by £120 a year.","Members of Free Enterprise Group of Conservative MPs issue unanimous call for welfare cap to be reduced from current level, £26,000 .

"Fined: Natasha and Stewart Sutherland pictured arriving at Telford Magistrates Court. They were fined £630 and ordered to pay £300 after they went on holiday with their children during term time . A couple were hit with a £1,000 penalty yesterday for taking their three children out of school for a foreign holiday. Stewart and Natasha Sutherland fell foul of a new law allowing councils to fine parents who fail to ensure their children attend class. They returned home from the week-long break to Rhodes – their first family holiday in five years – to find they had been fined £360. This was soon doubled to £720 because they did not pay up quickly enough. The case went to a magistrates court yesterday where the Sutherlands were forced to enter a guilty plea. Their fine was amended to £630 with £300 costs and a £63 victim surcharge. Speaking after the case, Mr Sutherland, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, said the week in question was the only one he and his wife could both take off work. ‘We had no choice but to plead guilty otherwise me and my wife could have been behind bars,’ added the 39-year-old. ‘Surely that would make our children’s education suffer more than a much-needed holiday? I can’t see the justice in it at all. ‘I work in a sensitive job where staffing levels have to be maintained. There’s been a recruitment and overtime ban and it’s been impossible to arrange summer leave that fits in with the rest of the family. ‘I know how important education is – but there’s a bigger picture. Family time is important, too, and the children’s behaviour and schooling has improved massively since our holiday.’ Justices in Telford, Shropshire, . rejected the family’s argument that the holiday was booked before the . new school attendance law came into place. Claims: Following the ruling, Mr Sutherland said outside court today that 'people who make these laws do not live in the real world' The Sutherland family: (left to right) Sian, 13, mother Natasha, Keane, six, father Stewart and daughter Rhiannon, 15 on holiday in Rhodes . The . couple – with Rhiannon, 15, Sian, 13, and Keane, six – went abroad on . September 25, just 25 days after the law came into force. It ended a . policy that allowed schools to grant up to ten days off for family . holidays. Now parents are required to send their children to school except in exceptional circumstances. Offenders . risk a £2,500 fine or three months in jail. The Sutherlands had been . refused permission by the school but decided to take the holiday anyway. Paradise: The family of five went to the Greek Island of Rhodes, a destination popular with British tourists . The local authority issues a penalty notice to parents who fail to ensure their kids attend school. It equates to £60 per child, rising to £120 if it's not paid within 21 days. After 28 days, if the fine remains unpaid, the local authority is required to begin legal proceedings in a magistrate's court. The couple are being prosecuted under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act, subsections one and eight.The two parts refer to a parent's failure to secure regular attendance at school of registered pupil. If a child of compulsory school age fails to attend the school regularly, his parent is guilty of an offence. If . the parent knows that his child is failing to attend regularly at the . school and fails without reasonable justification to cause him to do so, . he is guilty of an offence. If . a person is guilty to any of the above offences they are liable on . summary conviction with punishments ranging from a fine to a three-month . prison sentence. The guidelines apply to all state-funded schools. Mr Sutherland, who . defended himself and wife Natasha, 36, in court, added: ‘I stand by my . decision. 'Most parents can take their holiday when kids are off. 'Unfortunately I can’t. There’s no flexibility at all. If the whole . country took their holiday when the kids were off school the country . would come to a standstill. 'It’s like we are being taxed because I’m a . shift worker. ‘I’m being treated like a criminal because I am trying to do the best for my family.’ The . Sutherlands, from Telford, claim they have not lost out because the . money they saved with an out-of-season holiday was greater than the . penalty. Prosecuting for . Telford & Wrekin Council, Carol Trigger told the court the family . were warned they did not have permission to go on holiday. She said: ‘There was a change in legislation that had been communicated to parents in July via the school newsletter. ‘Mr . and Mrs Sutherland had the opportunity to pay the lesser fines . totalling £360 within 21 days but they chose not to pay. The penalty . notice clearly states the non-payment of fines will result in . prosecution.’ A Department . for Education spokesman said: ‘Poor attendance at school can have a . hugely damaging effect, and children who attend regularly are nearly . four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who . are regularly absent. Youngest: Their six-year-old son Keane was taken out of Donnigton Wood Primary School in Telford . Older children: Their daughters Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, both attend Sutherland Business and Enterprise College in Telford . ‘That is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. ‘We have increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the amount of time they have to pay. ‘Parents . should never simply discount a possible penalty notice from the cost of . a cheaper holiday, because this is a criminal offence.’","Stewart and Natasha Sutherland fined £630 and ordered to pay £300 in costs in court today .

"A lawyer has shot himself dead just weeks after his mother was found murdered in her bed and 15 months after he witnessed his father's 'accidental' death while they took a hiking trip. John Conrad Wagner, 32, was found dead in his apartment in Philadelphia as police began homing in on him as a suspect in the shooting death of his mother, Carolyn, in December. In light of the deaths, questions have been raised about the veracity of Wagner's story that his father slipped while taking photos on a trip to the Mount Rainier National Park in Washington in 2011. Authorities now believe the younger . Wagner killed his mother due to the financial pressures of hefty . students loans, which he believed would take him 20 years to pay back. Before tragedy: John Wagner is pictured with his mother Carolyn last Christmas, just days before police believe he killed her. As police were about to arrest him, Wagner shot himself dead . By killing his mother, 64, he could have hoped to inherit her assets and bank accounts, police said. But when his body was found in his Pine Street home on January 31, there was no note to confirm the motive. 'We'll never know his motive,' Marion County Sheriff's Capt. Robert Sandlin told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'What is our opinion? Financial. He had a lot of student loans that were outstanding.' After Wagner graduated from Florida State University, he went on to achieve a law degree from Villanova, and stayed in Philadelphia, where he struggled to get a job. He eventually landed work overlooking . claims for firms representing pharmaceutical companies, and his . colleagues told the Daily News that he was a well-liked, upbeat member of . the team. Mystery: His father, Roger Wagner, slipped to his death while on a hiking trip with John in 2011 . Tragic trip: They were at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington when Roger slipped taking photos . But he also struggled with his student debt, which kept him from his dreams of having a family. 'Carolyn was hopeful that he would get . married, settle down and get a permanent job,' Batsch said. 'It's just that . he had some student-loan debt that was heavy. It was taking up a lot of . his salary. He just felt like he couldn't.' Happier times: Carolyn was left with unanswered questions about her husband's death, friends said . In September 2011, he took a trip with his father, Roger Wagner, 59, when tragedy struck. John later told authorities that he and his father were walking along a trail at the top of a canon when his father stopped to take pictures and slipped, plunging 40 ft into a stream below. John Wagner said he'd not seen the accident but heard his screams as he had fell. The accident happened at dusk and authorities were only able to begin rescue efforts the next day, when Roger's body was found downstream from a massive waterfall. It was ruled an accidental death. After his father's death, he refused . to talk about it and his grieving mother, who lived in Ocala, Florida, . was left without answers, her friends told the Daily News. 'It did bother her,' friend Patty Batsch said. 'I think she did have . questions. She said when the time is right she was going . to try and talk to him about it.' Then last December, Wagner drove to his mother's home in Florida for Christmas. But days later, neighbours Amin and Sally Khan noticed that they hadn't seen Carolyn for a while. They . went to her home and found her body in her bed. She had been shot . multiple times and her purse, phone and wedding rings were gone. Florida police determined John Wagner had been the last person to see his mother alive, so pulled him in for questioning. He . told officers he had never owned a gun but when he returned to . Philadelphia, he reported to city police that a 9 mm Ruger handgun he . owned had been stolen from his house, Sandlin said. Scene: Carolyn was found dead at her Ocala, Florida home by neighbours who hadn't seen her for days . The shell casings at the scene of her killing were consistent with bullets fired from a 9 mm Ruger. Detectives from Florida also executed a search warrant on his home, and found he had searched for 'who did the shooting' and information on guns and forensics on his computer, police said. With evidence mounting against him, police went to arrest him and conduct another search of his home on January 31. But instead they found him dead from a gunshot wound. Police said the cases of all three deaths are closed, yet friends said there are still many unanswered questions about what part, if any, he had in his fathers death and why he killed his mother. 'Law school isn't worth killing your . mother over,' said Khan, the neighbour. 'Whatever the motive was, nobody will ever . know, because only he knows what made him do it.'","John Wagner shot himself as police homed in on him as suspect in the murder of his mother Carolyn, 64, in Florida in December .

"Libyan revolutionary fighters are surrounding an area where a fugitive son of Muammar Gaddafi, Saif al-Islam, is believed to have taken refuge. Rebel fighters said they were deploying south of the town of Bani Walid to an area where they believed Saif al-Islam was hiding after his flight from his father’s hometown of Sirte on Thursday. Bani Walid, 100 miles south-west of Tripoli, fell to revolutionary forces earlier this month after soldiers loyal to Gaddafi put up determined resistance for  several weeks. The fall of the Gaddafi clan: Colonel Gaddafi, left, and, it is thought, his son Mutassim, centre, were both killed on the attack on Sirte yesterday. Saif al-Islam, his heir, right, is thought to have been captured . Saif al-Islam was widely reported to have been based in the town during its resistance, before moving to Sirte. National Transitional Council . official Abdel Majid Mlegta said Gaddafi’s Niger-based security chief . Abdullah al-Senussi had been in contact with Saif al-Islam to try to . help him escape to the neighbouring country, ‘but our brigades are . encircling this area south of Bani Walid’. There had been various reports of . Saif's condition following the death of his father, with some reports . that he had been shot, and even some claims that he had lost both arms. However, . a National Transitional Council spokesman told NBC on Saturday that Saif . and Moussa Ibrahim, the former media frontman for the Gaddafi's regime, . were captured in Nessma, near Bani Walid, while they were being moved . to Misrata. That report has yet to be confirmed. And conflicting . reports emerged yesterday claiming that Saif he had already been . captured in Zlitan, 99 miles from Tripoli, while receiving treatment for . wounds. No pictures have emerged of Saif since his father was captured and killed on Thursday. Laid back: Gaddafi poses on a sofa in a photo taken some years ago with two of his sons, believed to be . Mohammed, left, and Saif, right, and his daughter, Ayesha . Any escape will worry the . British political elite who could face acute embarrassment if Saif was . ultimately captured and ended up in court. Saif became close to leading figures . in the British government after Tony Blair signed the notorious ‘Deal in . the Desert’ in March 2004. Prince . Andrew has also been linked to the bomber’s controversial release. The . Duke of York was accused of holding secret ‘detailed discussions’ over . the release of the Lockerbie bomber with Saif in 2009, during an . official Foreign Office-sponsored trip to Algeria. There had been news of his apparent escape earlier on Saturday, with reports of him fleeing across the vast Libyan desert towards Niger from the carnage of Sirte, revealed by Abdul Majid Mlegta, a senior military commander of the interim NTC. His statement came after a day of . rumour and conflicting reports in Tripoli that had seen Saif, 39, . variously killed, fighting for his life in hospital and being held in . custody. In the hours after the deaths of . Gaddafi and another son Mutassim, 34 – who had been in charge of Sirte’s . defences – it was said Saif had been critically wounded when his convoy . was hit by an RAF bombing raid. Saif is thought to be trying to join . up with another brother Saadi, 38, who fled to Niger in September . together with other Gaddafi allies and a fortune in gold and U.S. dollars. Mohammed, 41. Status - fled: The only child from Gaddafi's first wife, . Mohammed was head of the Libyan Olympic committee and chairman of the . General Post and Telecom Company which operated the country's mobile . phone and satellite communications networks. He fled to Algeria after the . fall of Tripoli. Saif al-Islam, 39. Status - wounded: Gaddafi's eldest son from his second . wife, Saif Al-Islam was the dictator's favourite and one-time heir . apparent. Educated in London and Vienna, he was a notorious playboy. Rebels claimed to have captured him during the fall of Tripoli but he . escaped the capital. Yesterday, . the NTC initially said Saif fled Sirte in a convoy heading for the . desert, but then announced he was shot in the leg by revolutionary . fighters and taken to hospital. There are fresh claims he has been captured. He is wanted by the International . Criminal Court for crimes against humanity . In an indication that Niger may become . a rallying point for the family, Mlegta revealed that in recent days . Gaddafi’s security chief Abdullah  al-Senussi, was believed to have . ‘slipped into hiding’ in the country. Senussi is Gaddafi’s brother-in-law . and wanted for crimes against humanity on an international arrest . warrant from the war crimes tribunal. Ten days ago both Saadi and Saif were . said to have tried to strike a deal with the NTC that would have . allowed Gaddafi to leave Sirte – an offer emphatically  rejected. Officials said last night that Saif . was believed to have been with his father in Sirte and to have somehow . escaped amid the confusion after the convoy fleeing west was twice . attacked by Nato drones and warplanes. Saadi, 38. Status - fled: A former footballer who played in Italy's . Serie A league, he ran Libya's football federation and invested . millions of pounds in the country's fledgling film industry. He fled to . Niger in September. Hannibal, 36. Status - fled: Violent and abusive, Hannibal was accused . of beating his pregnant girlfriend in Paris in 2005 and was arrested . for assaulting two servants in a Geneva hotel, but ran back to Libya . after being released on bail. He ran Libya's General National Maritime . Transport Company, which controlled the country's oil exports. He fled . to Algeria with brother Mohammed in August. Mutassim, 34. Status - killed: A lieutenant colonel in the Libyan army, . Mutassim fled to Egypt after masterminding a failed coup against his . father. He was forgiven and returned to Gaddafi's side as his national . security adviser. Killed in the assault on Sirte, according to NTC . officials, although conflicting reports claim he was captured alive. Fatiha, age unknown. Status - unknown: . Gaddafi's first marriage to school teacher Fatiha al-Nuri lasted less than a year. She reputedly never met Gaddafi until the day of their wedding. The couple had one son, Mohammed, but separated after six months and little is known of Gaddafi's first wife after their divorce in 1970. Yesterday Nato officials released details of it role in possibly the last strikes of the eight-month civil war. It said planes had hit 11 vehicles in . an armoured convoy speeding the late Libyan leader out of Sirte on . Thursday, although Nato did not know Gaddafi was in the convoy. The account suggested Gaddafi’s . fleeing convoy was considerably larger, and more vehicles were hit, than . previously reported. Nato aircraft struck 11 pro-Gaddafi . vehicles that were part of a larger group of approximately 75 vehicles . near Sirte, the statement said. ‘The vehicles were carrying a . substantial amount of weapons and ammunition posing a significant threat . to the local civilian population. The convoy was engaged by a Nato . aircraft to reduce the threat.’ Ayesha, 34. Status - fled: Nicknamed the Claudia Schiffer of North . Africa, Gaddafi's glamorous blonde daughter led rallies of her father's . supporters in Tripoli. The Western-educated lawyer was part of Saddam . Hussein's defence team. She fled to Algeria with her mother Safiyah and . brothers Mohammed and Hannibal in August, and gave birth days later. Saif al-Arab, 29. Status - dead: Playboy Saif Al-Arab was arrested twice . in Germany for an attack on a nightclub bouncer and for excessive noise . from his Ferrari F430, while studying in Munich. Charges were dropped as . prosecutors ruled trial was not in the national interest. He was killed in a . Nato airstrike on the Gaddafi compound in April. The statement said that at the time of . the strike, Nato did not know that Gaddafi was in the convoy, . reiterating that it was not Nato’s policy to target individuals. Last night, Admiral Jim Stavridis, . Nato’s top commander, said he was recommending the end of the alliance’s . Libya mission calling it ‘a good day for Nato. A great day for the . people of Libya’. And Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh . Rasmussen said a preliminary decision had been made to end the air . operation on October 31. In . August, as Tripoli fell to rebel forces and after a day of bloody . street battles in the Libyan capital, Saif boasted of victory. Despite . having been reported captured and under arrest, he appeared outside a . Tripoli hotel to make a defiant speech, declaring: ‘We have broken the . backbone of the rebels. It was a trap. We gave them a hard time, so we . are winning.’ Gaddafi’s . other children have all fled the country or been killed or captured . during the civil war. It is not known where either of his two wives are. Khamis, 28. Status - dead: Gaddafi's youngest son led his own feared . army unit, the Khamis Brigade, which was infamous for torture and . intimidation. He was killed in fighting during the fall of Tripoli . Safiyah, 60s. Status - fled: Nurse Safiyah Farkash al-Baraasi met Gaddafi when he had his appendix removed in 1969 and the couple were . married for 40 years. She is the mother of seven of his eight . biological children, and the couple also adopted two children, a son and . a daughter. Shopaholic Safiyah was reputed to have used Gaddafi's . private jet for shopping trips to Europe, and owned airline Buraq Air. Her personal wealth has been estimated at £19billion, including 20 tons . of gold. She fled to Algeria with Gaddafi's daughter Ayesha in August. Hana, mid-20s.

"Roberto Martinez has jokingly blamed the photographer for the picture of Aaron Lennon that gave the impression he was unhappy signing for Everton on loan. The picture, taken by external photographer Peter Byrne but released by the club, became an internet sensation with MP Andy Burnham - an Everton fan - remarking on Twitter that the England winger appeared distinctly unimpressed with his new place of work. Lennon, having arrived from Tottenham, then had to insist on the same medium that he was happy. Aaron Lennon looks glum as he is presented as an Everton player after signing on loan from Tottenham . Roberto Martinez quipped that it was the photographer's job to make Lennon smile for the pictures . Lennon took to Twitter to poke fun at the pictures and insist that he is 'buzzing' to be at Everton . 'He is very happy - I would blame the photographer because it is their job to make him produce a nice smile!' joked Martinez. 'But I saw a different face - a focused face, of someone who is ready to train and to perform. 'It has been great to see the way Aaron has adjusted, because when you sign a player in January, it is very difficult to find someone who is up to speed with the league and their match fitness. 'He is fully fit and ready to make an impact as part of the squad for the weekend. 'We are delighted, and I know there has been a lot said about the pictures - I will chase the photographer because I wasn't happy with that at all!'

Martinez, pictured on the touchline at Selhurst Park last weekend, is delighted with the signing of Lennon . Meanwhile, Martinez has dismissed talk of James McCarthy suffering another injury setback and stressed he expects the midfielder to be available for Saturday's Merseyside derby against rivals Liverpool. It was believed McCarthy, who has only played twice since November due to his hamstring issue and last featured in late December, had aggravated the problem in training, ruling him out of this weekend's game. But asked about that at his press conference on Thursday to preview the clash at Goodison Park, Martinez said: 'No, he hasn't suffered a setback. 'He was in hospital yesterday having a scan to make sure he is fully recovered and the scan showed he is perfectly healed. James McCarthy (left), pictured against Swansea City, is expected to be fit for Saturday's Merseyside derby . McCarthy (left), pictured against Liverpool in September, has been struggling with hamstring problems . 'Now it is just a matter of adapting him into the match intensity, and I expect James to be available for the squad at the weekend, so it is terrific news in that respect.' There was more good news on goalkeeper Tim Howard, who is back in training after a calf problem but will not be fit to face Liverpool. Leon Osman, Steven Pienaar and Tony Hibbert are still ruled out through injury. Martinez added: 'Tim Howard is training now and it will be important to make the right decision. He feels strong and ready but medical advice says probably another week to make sure he's fully healed and we don't take any risks.Â . 'Any soft tissue injury you have to be wary but it's incredible how quick he's back in training. We will assess him and see but it looks like another week.' Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard is back in training but will not be fit to play against Liverpool this weekend . Joel Robles has stepped up to replace Howard and has improved in recent weeks after a difficult start in defeats by Newcastle and Hull.Â . 'It's been great to see the support Joel Robles has received from everyone and I think we have seen him becoming someone who can enjoy that role,' said Martinez. 'As a keeper that's important, such a specific, black and white position. It was great to see him perform like he did against Palace, keeping a clean sheet.'

"The daughter of a wealthy Fifa delegate who helped in the controversial decision to name Qatar and Russia future hosts of the World Cup received a £2million payment from a business associate of her father with Qatari links, it has been claimed. Antonia Wigand Teixeira, the daughter of Brazil's Fifa representative Ricardo Teixeira, was paid the large sum of money in 2011. It is not certain from whom the funds came, but it is thought that Sandro Rossell, the former president of Qatar-sponsored Barcelona football club, was behind the transfer. Transfer: The money was paid to the daughter of Ricardo Teixeira, former Fifa representative from Brazil . Documents seen by the Daily Telegraph show that Miss Teixeira was given the money on June 22 2010, when she was 10 years old. The payment is the latest in a series of financial revelations surrounding Fifa's decision to award the World Cup to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. An investigation has been launched by Fifa into the bidding process, and is scrutinising the business dealings of several committee members. 'Source': Sandro Rosell, former president of Barcelona FC, is thought to have transferred the funds . A report by Michael Garcia, a chief investigator on Fifa's ethics committee, is expected to be delivered later this year. The Qatari bid in particular has drawn criticism as the country does not have a strong footballing reputation, and temperatures are often as high as 40C, raising questions about the practically of hosting a football tournament there. Probe: Fifa ethics investigator Michael Garcia is scrutinising business dealings of committee members . Mr Teixeira stepped down from the Fifa committee in 2012 - after the crucial decisions had been made. Brazilian police have recently begun their own investigation into his activities. He has recently moved to Miami. Those in charge of Qatar's World Cup efforts have denied that the payment was in exchange for Mr Teixeira's support - and say it has no relation to the bid. The Qatar bid's legal team has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Mr Teixeira was a member of the Fifa executive committee for 22 years. He has also been embroiled in corruption scandals over allegations that he took bribes from a company which was given exclusive rights to market the World Cup. Mr Rosell was president of Barcelona football club until January this year. He stepped down after a judge agreed to hear a case alleging that his misappropriated funds from a transfer deal. Barcelona counts Qatar Airways - which is wholly owned by the Qatari government - as a major sponsor. They have pledged almost €100million to sponsor the club's shirts. Neither Mr Teixeira nor Mr Rosell responded to questions from the Telegraph.","Antonia Wigand Teixeira given £2million payment in 2011 - when she was 10 .

"Pimp: Sorient Sigba made a total of £239,756 from 'Freddy's', but will pay back just £13,017.09 . A seconday school teacher who ran an upmarket City of London brothel that raked in £1million a year has been ordered to repay a tiny fraction of his profits. Father-of-four Sorient Sigba, 54, worked at the Geoffrey Chaucer School in Elephant and Castle during the day while he was operating  'Freddy's' from a three-bedroomed mews house in the City - raking in a personal profit of £239,756. Despite charging 'tricks' up to £5,000 for a night, he was told to pay back just £13,017.09 following a proceeds of crime hearing at Southwark Crown Court. Sigba, also known as Freddy, ran the den with Simon Earl, 58 and brothel manager Vera Fosuhene, 47 - known to her clients as Angelina. Earl . made £565,131.33 from sex workers at Freddy's and was ordered to hand . back £103,592 or serve two more years on top of his two-year sentence. Wine . broker Michael Wallen, 50, who helped launder the dirty money, must pay . £83,241.20 from the £391,019.07 he made or serve 20 months on top of . his jail term of two years and five months. Customers were chauffeur driven to the . sex den from outside City strip clubs to romp with girls who encouraged . them to take as much cocaine as possible to 'make the sex better'. Cash-paying . customers were charged £300 an hour, £390 if they preferred to use a . credit card on arrival and £60 for a wrap of cocaine. Freddy's . was opened at the leasehold property in 2006 and in just nine months . before the ring was smashed by police, its turnover was a staggering . £946,776. In a text message . to Sigba one customer wrote: 'I'm in the mood for a total f*** fest. Having two girls who f*** like rabbits to get me in the mood would be . good.' An investigation by . the Metropolitan Police's Human Exploitation and Organised Crime Command . led to undercover officers making three visits to the brothel before . swooping in October 2010. Police known only as 'John' and 'Alex' visited the haunt after being . approached by mini-cab drivers outside the City Burlesque club, in . Farringdon. Hidden: 35 John's Mews. London, which housed the upmarket bordello 'Freddy's', frequented by City bankers . During the first . visit in July 2011 the door to the brothel was opened by Fosuhene and . inside were five scantily clad girls aged between 20 and 25. During . a second visit in October 2011 a Jaguar, later found to be registered . to Sigba, was parked outside the property and Sigba opened the door to . the brothel. Inside the driver who brought the officer told Fosuhene he was 'looking for a real good party.' When . officers arrested Sigba at his office in Hatton Garden they found a . hire purchase agreement for a Jaguar seen outside the mews house. If he defaults, Sigba will serve another eight months on top of his three year jail sentence. Fosuhene had narrowly avoided jail after admitting managing a brothel and two counts of supplying cocaine. She has not been ordered to repay anything as she was only being paid £50 a day, picking girls for the clients. Fined: Both Vera Fosuhene (left) and Michael Wallen (right) admitted to the charges against them .

"Its nickname from the locals suggests it would be better off in space rather than their quaint village. And this huge glass eco-house dubbed 'Sputnik' certainly looks out of place in a beautiful picture-postcard area of Somerset - in the shadow of the local Grade I listed medieval church. The dramatic circular property was approved by planners two years ago but is now being built in Batcombe, near Shepton Mallet, just yards away from the 15th century Church of St Mary the Virgin.

They have nicknamed the building after Sputnik - the world's first artificial satellite, which was launched by the USSR in October 1957 - because they say it resembles a landing space craft. Ivan Ure, 91, who lives nearby said: ‘It's horrible - it looks like the back end of an old aircraft carrier and is totally out of keeping with our lovely village. ‘I never imagined it would be as bad as this when I first heard about it.

"Luxury goods worth more than £11 million are to be seized from a Saudi princess to pay her shopping bills, a Paris judge ordered today. Maha Al-Sudairi, who was once married to the country’s late Crown Prince, helped herself to millions of pounds worth of goods whenever she visited the French capital. As well as art works and jewellery, they included £5,500 worth of luxury chocolates, and £1.4m on the hire of two Rolls Royce Phantoms and ‘around 30 chauffers’ to take her shopping. Maha Al-Sudairi last year failed to settle a £5.5m bill with the Shangri-la Hotel (pictured) after she took over an entire floor with 60 servants for six months . Last year, Mrs Al-Sudairi took over an entire floor at the four star Shangri-la Hotel with 60 servants for six months, but failed to settle the £5.5m bill. When King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia refused to pay for her stay, she claimed diplomatic immunity and moved to the Royal Monceau Hotel nearby. The 58-year-old has now been sued by six creditors through a court in the suburb of Nanterre. A judge ruled that three storage units registered to the princess should be opened, and their contents sold so as to pay off her debts. The princess, who is currently in Saudi Arabia, is the divorced wife of the late Saudi Crown Prince and interior minister, Nayef bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud. He died last June, just as Mrs Al-Sudairi left the Shangri-la. In 2009 the princess was urged to stay away from France after running up unpaid bills of £14m. The princess is known to have bought three storage units in central Paris, where she is believed to have stashed her wares from her shopping trips around the French capital . She is known to have bought three storage units in central Paris, where she is believed to have stashed her wares from her shopping trips around the French capital – said to include luxury leather goods, artworks, jewellery, and clothing worth up to £10 million. A spokesman for the Shangri-La said the hotel was pleased at the judge's ruling, but did not expect the bill to be settled soon. 'The princess's belongings will need to be valued and then sold at auction, and even then we may need to take international legal action against the princess before we see any cash,' he said. The princess's fabulously wealthy credentials meant her IOU notes handed to shopkeepers reading 'payment to follow' were usually accepted. Over the past years, up to 30 of Paris's most exclusive luxury goods retailers have fallen foul of her credit notes. Jacky Giami, owner of Paris's Key Largo leisure wear store, said the princess and her relatives pillaged his shop of more than £100,000 worth of stock three years ago. He said he spent days loitering in the bar of the Georges V hotel hoping to confront her, only to learn she had fled to London. In 1995, Princess Maha was accused of assaulting a servant in Orange County, Florida, whom she suspected of stealing £150 000 from her. No charges were filed.","Maha Al-Sudairi helped herself to goods worth millions in French capital .

"A group of New York City musicians who took their dispute over a dead cat and two smashed TVs to Judge Judy have revealed they faked it all to win settlement cash and a free trip to Los Angeles. Jonathan, Kate and Brian really were roommates at the time of suit and they really did have a cat named Trips, but Jonathan never drunkenly smashed the pet to death with a television. However, that's exactly what they told Judge Judy in 2010. And along with some other hilarious made-up details, their sham episode made for one of the most memorable episodes of the court reality show to-date. Scroll down for video . Yes, your honor: Jonathan Coward (left) and his roommate Kate completely fabricated a legal dispute in order to get onto Judge Judy in 2010 and receive a cash settlement . Meow: The musician roommates from New York claimed that Jonathan drunkenly killed Kate's cat by smashing it with a TV but that Kate quickly buried it . Jonathan, who appears as the long-haired, leather jacket sporting ne'er do well in the episode spoke to Vice about how the idea was hatched and how the con played out. 'Absolutely none of it' was real, Jonathan recently told Vice, before admitting: 'the cat existed.' 'His name was Trips, and to my knowledge he's still alive. He did end up running away, like, pretty soon after the show, though.' The idea began when Kate moved up to New York from Baltimore and was in search of a way to make money. 'So I told her we could come up with some story for Judge Judy, and we would probably get the settlement and a free trip to LA,' he said. 'I was aware that the cap for small claims was around four grand. Kate got real excited about it and emailed the show straight away.' 'Kate is nasty': Their roommate Brian also appeared and pretended to be Jonathan's Kate-bashing ex-boyfriend . In the story Kate hatched, Jonathan was black-out drunk when he started to become destructive until things devolved to the point that he was throwing things. He threw one TV into a wall then threw another, which Kate would claim crushed her cat to death. In the episode, Kate's sad facade begins to crack while she discusses the dead cat and at various other moments it seems as if both she and Jonathan are having a tough time not laughing. According to Jonathan, the producer they worked with was pretty clear that she knew none of it was real from the very start. 'She called me and was like, ""You know, you guys can comp your meals from when you get in, just save your receipts. But if you guys have receipts for the same restaurant, the whole thing is off,""' he told Vice. For your troubles: Neither the producers nor Judge Judy herself really seemed to believe the giggling roommates' story, but they paid her $1,250 for the smashed property and kitty, nonetheless . He said Judge Judy herself seemed not to buy it, either. 'Our taping was so quick,' he said. 'I think the reason our taping was so short was because Judy ended up figuring out that we were lying.' During the arguments, Jonathan plays the lazy musician role and Kate pretends to cry over her dead cat while Judge Judy scrutinizes their pictorial 'evidence,' Their roommate Brian also shows up in the episode and pretends to be Jonathan's Kate-bashing ex-boyfriend, though he isn't actually interested in men. Then, just like that, the verdict: Kate was awarded $1,250. 'We divided it between us,' Jonathan said, along with his $250 appearance fee. 'Then we went to Musso & Frank's and used our money to have a lavish, silly lunch.' They also rented a convertible Mustand and drove to Malibu, where they blew much of the money drinking champagne and relaxing with friends all day. 'It felt awesome,' Jonathan told Vice. 'It felt so good.' So what they do with the money: The group immediately rented a convertible Mustang, drove to Malibu and drank champagne in a hot tub all day .","New York City roommates Jonathan, Kate and Brian hatched the idea and made it on the air in 2010 .

The suspect, who police identified as Ray Miles, and two people who were stabbed were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. None of their injuries were considered serious. The station reported that the melee started after the man spoke to news director Jon Janes on a lobby phone, saying the Department of Veterans Affairs was mishandling his case. When Mr Janes explained that the man needed to discuss the issue with the VA, the man stormed out of the building. However, he returned about 10 minutes later and threw a lamp through the glass front doors, shattering them. The suspect was later identified as homeless man Ray Miles . Security footage from the news station shows Miles opening the door through the broken glass then walking into the building. Mr Janes told the receptionist to tell other employees to leave the front office area. The station said some employees left as the man ran through the halls. Some employees managed to tackle Miles, and that’s when he allegedly pulled out a knife and stabbed sales manager Roger Brokke and sales associate Greg Palmer. Both were knifed in the leg, and Miles bit Mr Brokke on the ear as well. After the receptionist had alerted the staff of the intruder, Master Control Operator Joe Garrett called 911 and witnessed the takedown via security camera. Mr Janes said this was not his first contact with Miles.

"Four first responders have been placed on 'modified desk duty' following the death of an asthmatic, obese man after he was placed in a chokehold by a NYPD officer on Thursday. The two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians work for Richmond University Medical Center in Staten Island, a FDNY source told MailOnline. As part of 'modified desk duty,' the employees can't answer emergency calls during an investigation into 43-year-old Eric Garner's death, the source explained. Meanwhile, Rev. Al Sharpton delivered a sermon in the wake of Garner's death at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Sunday.

Officers Daniel Pantaleo and Justin Damico have since been placed on desk duty, with Pantaleo forced to hand in his gun and badge, according to the New York Daily News, which originally made the original video public. The second video shows Garner on his side on the ground as a crowd builds around him. Police first try to make the person capturing the footage leave, but they do not. Cops try to talk with Garner, but he does not respond - his eyes are closed and his head is on the sidewalk.

People keep asking why they aren't doing CPR, and paramedics do not arrive for over three minutes. The paramedic tries communicating with Garner: 'We're here to help.' But he does not answer.

The paramedic checks his pulse and says he's still alive, then decides he needs to go on a stretcher. Still not alert, Garner is rolled over and at least six cops, plus the paramedic, hoist him on to a stretcher. Another person asks again why no CPR was performed. 'Because he's still breathing,' and officer snaps at the person. Despite Garner's medical condition being apparent to the still-building crowd, many cops stand around casually talking with each other, some can even be heard laughing.

Grief: Esaw, pictured with Eric, says she struggled to watch the footage of her husband's final moments . A law enforcement source told the New York Post that he officer believed to have used the chokehold, who has not yet been identified, may lose his job. 'It violates protocol. It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a choke hold,' the unidentified source told the newspaper. Earlier footage released Friday shows one officer put Garner in a chokehold - a maneuver barred under NYPD practice code - while police tried to arrest him over claims he was selling bootleg cigarettes. Garner's wife watched footage of the arrest, and her 43-year-old husband's final moments on a sidewalk, on Friday, the New York Daily News said. 'They killed him. They choked him and took him down and I could hear him screaming that he couldn’t breathe,' she told the newspaper, which has an exclusive copy of the film. 'It was so hard to watch.

The 46-year-old was comforted by the Reverend Al Sharpton at the Saturday press conference held by Sharpton's National Action Network. She sobbed uncontrollably as Sharpton described the circumstances of her husband's death. 'The issue is not if one was selling [untaxed] cigarettes, the issue is that an unarmed man was subjected to a chokehold and the result is he is no longer with us,' Sharpton said. Sharpton then joined the family on a peaceful demonstration through Staten Island, to protest the circumstances of Garner's death. In the video Garner, who was not armed, is heard denying that he has been involved in illegal activity when a plainclothes police officer accosted him. 'Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I’m tired of it. It stops today!' Garner said.

"A Los Angeles woman who fractured her skull while riding on an open top Starline Tours bus last October plans to sue the company. Lauren Guerra has accused the company of negligence after she was struck by a branch while on an open top section of the bus during a chartered Halloween trip. The 35-year-old fractured her skull, shattered her left eye socket, damaged an eye muscle and has been left with double vision. Injured: Lauren Guerra fractured her skull and eye socket after being hit by a branch while on the open deck of a StarLines Tour bus in October . Treatment: Guerra, pictured before the accident, has had to pay $20,000 so far in medical treatment . Guerra announced her plans to sue after hearing about the death of Mason Zisette, who died last week in similar circumstances. Tragic: Mason Zisette, 16, died last week after hitting his head on a bridge while on a Starlines Tour bus . The 16-year-old boy was hit by a bridge and died as he stood on an open section of a bus while it drove down a freeway. Guerra said she brought forward her planned legal action 'After hearing about what happened to . Mason and realizing that this company did nothing to prevent this from . happening,' she told KTLA. She said after her experiences she felt the company should have taken steps to improve safety. Guerra claimed that during the ride she was injured on, the bus had been traveling at 45mph and everyone was trying to avoid being hit by branches. 'There were times when people had to duck under branches. I stood up at the wrong time and I got taken out going about 45mph by a rather large tree branch,' she told ABC7. Guerra's medical bills have cost $20,000 so far, and she still has problems with her vision and needs further treatment. She plans to sue Starline Tours for negligence and damages. The complaint alleges that none of the passengers had received safety warnings about traveling on the upper deck, and no staff were on the bus to supervise. Lawsuit: Guerra plans to sue Starline Tours for negligence and damages after being severely injured on an open top bus similar to the one pictured . Her attorney, Brian Kabateck, said: 'My client feels that after her incident, Starline should have done something to change what was happening on the bus. 'As a result of the fact that they made no changes and this poor young man died, she wanted to go public.' Starline Tours has not yet responded to a MailOnline request for comment.","Lauren Guerra has been left with double vision after being injured during Halloween party .

"The grandfather of a six-year-old girl whose tongue was ripped out by pit bulls has said he forgives the man who owned the dogs in an astonishing show of compassion. Zainabou Drame remains in a medically induced coma at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center following the incident outside her home on June 4 that left her with numerous facial injuries. The dogs, which were killed, were owned by Zontae Irby, a 24-year-old neighbor who was arrested on drugs charges after police searched his home following the attack - but the girl's grandfather, Leslie McElrath Jr., says he holds no ill feelings towards him. 'I am a man of scriptures,' McElrath told the Cincinnati Enquirer. 'The angry man does not receive the righteousness of God.' Fighter: Zainabou Drame, left, remains in a . medically-induced coma following a dog attack nearly two weeks ago. Her . grandfather said he has forgiven the dogs' owner, 24-year-old Zontae . Irby, right . Staying strong: Leslie McElrath Jr. said his granddaughter Zainabou Drame has had most of her face reconstructed since she was attacked by two pit bulls outside their home on June 4 . The grandfather, a lab technician, said doctors are slowly piecing the young girl back together - although they have not yet been able to re-attach her tongue. 'One dog grabbed her face and literally tore it off,' he said. 'The other one pulled her mouth off. That hurt her tear duct. They've fixed that, and they reattached her face. '[The dogs] broke her jaw, too. The doctors worked on that. They repaired her chin and changed the trach tube in her esophagus.' He added: 'They may be able to reattach her tongue someday or grow a new one. You can't believe the stuff modern medicine does.' McElrath described how his daughter's child had been playing tag with other neighborhood children when the attack began. She . had returned to the house for a drink and was not going to go outside . again, but one of her small friends knocked on the door and convinced her. Rescue: A police officer can be seen on dashcam . video jumping from a moving patrol car to save the six-year-old girl as she was being attacked. The officers shot dead the two dogs and took away a third . Taken to safety: Footage shows Zainabou Drame being carried to an ambulance on a stretcher . When she returned to the street, the two dogs escaped through a broken fence further up the street and lunged at the little girl. Hope: Doctors have reconstructed Zainabou's face but have not yet reattached her tongue . 'The pit . bulls got Zaina because she was the smallest of the kids, like the . jackals do with the herds on ""Wild Kingdom"",' McElrath said. After hearing calls for help, his daughter Tanina ran outside with a baseball bat to beat the two dogs, while his own dog, Cappuccino, tried its best to pull the larger animals off the small girl. Dashcam footage also shows police officers speeding towards the house before jumping outside their patrol car and shooting the pit bulls dead. McElrath said he is thankful for Tanina and Cappuccino as well as Cincinnati Police Officer . Josh Bricker who cleared her esophagus, meaning Zainabou did not choke on her own blood. He said he wants 'to thank that officer. I gave one of the other cops a hug and . told him that was for the big guy' - Bricker. 'I want him . to know how thankful I am. He saved her life,' he said. Despite the long road ahead, McElrath said he wants his granddaughter's story to be one of hope. 'What happened to Zaina is not about . dividing people, attacking someone, putting someone in jail, banning pit . bulls or killing dogs,' he said. 'This is an opportunity to . come together; to show the city how much people care, to help heal a . little girl.' Shocked: Moustapha Drame (left) yelled for his . mother Tanina Drame (right) when his sister was being attacked; Tanina .

Distraught: Zainabou Drame's family, including her grandfather, left, . said they could barely recognize the little girl after the attack as . most of her face had been mauled by the dogs . He added: 'I'm sad. But I'm not angry. I'm quiet because I'm praying to God to take care of her.' No charges have yet been filed from the attack but Irby has been indicted on trafficking in marijuana, possession of marijuana and receiving stolen property charges. SPCA of . Cincinnati crew seized a third pit bull owned by Irby. Officers shot the other two dogs dead on the scene after distracting them away from the girl. 'It’s . really indescribable and something no person should ever have to see and . something we’ll never forget,' Cincinnati Police Officer Kyle Strunk said. Now the family said it is trying to stay strong for Zainabou. Her father, Abdou Drame, previously said he could barely recognize his daughter's mauled face. Scene: Zainabou was attacked outside her home on the 2900 block of Aquadale Lane in Westwood . 'When I see her, I cannot handle it because it's so bad. All the face gone,' he said. Gina Tyus, Zainabou's aunt, described her niece's injuries as 'gruesome' and said one of her eyes had been sewn shut because the muscle beneath it no longer worked. 'Both . the dogs, one on each side, latched onto her face and ripped her jaw . almost completely off. It was broken to the point where you could . actually pull it away from her face,' Tyus said. 'She is lying there - her face is swollen almost beyond recognition.

"Sentenced: Roger Owens has been sent to prison for ten years after dragging a dog behind his truck . A South Carolina man has been jailed for ten years after dragging a dog for two miles behind his pick up truck at the end of last year. Roger Owens was found guilty of ill treatment of animals and traffic violations after he tied the dog's front legs to his truck, and forced the scared animal to try to run on her hind legs as he sped off. Thanks to the dedication of an animal charity, the dog was rescued and nursed back to health, and the man responsible for her injuries was brought to justice. Circuit Judge Letitia Verdin told . Roger Owens his actions were one of the cruelest things she had ever . seen as she sentenced him on Tuesday. He . was spotted driving erratically along a road while the terrified dog, . which has since been named Andra Grace, tried to keep up. The witnesses followed him and stayed with the dog one-year-old after he released the chain holding her and drove off. Owens' lawyer told the judge that her client did care for animals, but was drinking and had not been thinking straight. Thousands of animal lovers who heard about the plight of Andra Grace came forward to help pay for her vet bills, and have followed her story on a Facebook page. Cruel: The dog, which has been named Andra Grace, survived her ordeal and was nursed back to health . Horrific: The one-year-old dog was left with appalling injuries after she was tied to a pick up truck and dragged for two miles . Survivor: Despite her terrifying ordeal Andra Grace has remained loving . An animal control officer had originally believed the dog, who had recently had a litter of puppies, would need to be euthanized, but the team at Special Needs Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation (SNARR) stepped in. Through donations they were able to pay for her leg surgeries and skin grafts, as well as to offer rewards to try to catch the person responsible. The charity also tracked down and rehomed Andra Grace's five-week-old puppies and a terrier that had neck injuries and was living at the same property. The dogs had originally been loved family pets, but when their owners moved they were unable to bring the dogs with them. Suffering: As well as horrific leg injuries, Andra Grace was emaciated and had recently had a litter of puppies . Transformation: The dog is now happy and healthy, and living with a new family . Happy ending: Once she had recovered Andra Grace was adopted by a couple from Florida . They left the dogs in the care of some people in their neighborhood, but SNARR claimed that the animals were having to fend for themselves on an abandoned property. According to the charity's Facebook page, neighbors claimed that when complaints were made about Andra Grace begging for food, two men were asked to 'get rid of her'. Fortunately, Andra Grace has made a good recovery and, despite her ordeal, was soon found to be a sweet and good-natured dog. After getting over the worst of her injuries, the dog was adopted by a family in Florida, where she is happily settling into her new home.","Roger Owens was found guilty of animal cruelty and traffic violations .

"Convicted: Na Cola Franklin, 32, was found guilty by a jury in Allentown, Pennsylvania on Thursday . The mugshot of the bride-to-be who fatally stabbed her fiancé twice in the heart just hours before they were due to get married has been released two days after she killed her would-be husband. Na Cola Darcel Franklin, 31, appears dishevelled and her eyes were still red by the time she was photographed at the Whitehall Township police station in Pennsylvania following the attack. She has been charged with criminal homicide after twice stabbing Billy Rafael Brewster, 36, after they began arguing in the early hours of Saturday morning, police report. Franklin allegedly attacked Brewster in the apartment they shared with three children in eastern Pennsylvania. Police say they found Brewster bleeding from his chest shortly after 2am Saturday. Lehigh Valley Live reports that Franklin was only stopped after her would-be cousin tackled her, knocked the blood-stained kitchen knife out of her hand and stopped her from stabbing her fiancé. Brewster's cousin Nakia Kali and his wife Monique travelled to Whitehall Township from out of town for the wedding- which was scheduled for 10am Saturday morning- and were staying in the apartment that Brewster and Franklin shared with three children. At the time of the attack, four children were in the apartment but their names, ages, and relationships to the couple remains undisclosed. The Kalis were interviewed by police shortly after the authorities arrived at the scene around 2.19am. Landing: After being stabbed twice in the chest, Brewster crawled to the second floor landing outside of the apartment he shared with Franklin and three children . The couple said that they were out with Brewster and all arrived back to the apartment shortly after midnight. A little while later, the Kalis went into a bedroom and heard an argument begin between Brewster and Franklin after Brewster said that he and Franklin were going to buy food for everyone. When Mr Kali went to see what was going on, he got in between the fighting couple and tried to break up the argument. Mrs Kali only entered the fight when she heard someone scream 'knife'. After seeing blood on the left side of Brewster's chest and her husband standing in between Brewster and the knife-wieldling Franklin, she 'instinctively tackled' the woman in order to stop her from hitting Mr Kali. Once Mrs Kali had tackled Franklin, Mr Kali grabbed the knife from her hands and passed it off to a child, instructing the child to take the knife into the kitchen. During the episode, an injured Brewster crawled to the outdoor landing, which is where police found him when they arrived on the scene. He was transported to Lehigh Valley Hospital and was pronounced dead at 3.24am. Family members and the pastor who was scheduled to perform the couple’s wedding at 10am on Saturday morning arrived at the second-floor apartment throughout Sunday. The Allentown Morning Call reports that at Franklin’s video arraignment Saturday, the 31-year-old wept and choked out, 'I did not kill him on purpose.' Scene: The fight took place inside the apartment around 2am on Saturday morning, just eight hours before the couple were due to be married . Seemingly unable to comprehend the murder charge she faces, Franklin also pleaded to the judge, ‘you got to check again.’ The Morning Call reported that the suspect was rocking back and forth and wailing during the hearing. At one point she cried out, ‘I want my family back. I want to go home.’ Neighbour Steve Engel says the pastor who was supposed to perform the ceremony came to the apartment building after being unable to reach the couple, and a number of people who were apparently going to the wedding also showed up throughout the day. Another horrified neighbour, who lives across the hall from the couple, told Lehigh Valley Live that she didn’t think the couple had ‘any issues.’ 'I was really shocked. It made me sick to my stomach,' said Sara Arnold. As the investigation continues, a motive for the killing and the type of knife used has not been disclosed. Franklin is being held in the Lehigh County Prison without bail.","Relatives intervened as Na Cola Franklin, 31, got in a violent fight with fiancé Billy Brewster, 36 .

"A chance encounter has led to a lifetime's work for two American brothers, who are dedicated to helping a South African orphanage. The brothers first got involved with the center when Northwestern University graduate Nick Grava decided to miss his flight home so he could work at the children's home. Before long, Nick had become managing director, and his brother Chris had joined him in trying to increase funding for the 30 youngsters, many of whom lost parents to HIV and Aids. Scroll down for video . Joy: One of the girls who lives at the orphanage grins as she is hoisted in the air . Life changing: Chris Grava, left, and his brother Nick who moved to South Africa to run an orphanage . The brothers recently released a heartwarming video, filmed on a GoPro camera, that showed the children greeting Chris after a six-month break. The delightful video shows the children crowding around the brothers, laughing and smiling as they are thrown into the air or spun around, and dancing in the yard. The video was released as part of a campaign to try to raise $12,000 for charity Intsikelelo to keep the orphanage running for another year. When political science graduate Nick, who studied in Illinois, first visited it in 2012, it could barely cover its basic expenses, such as diapers for the babies, or pay for the caregivers. Nick, who had been visiting his brother who was studying in South Africa for a semester, saw the challenging circumstances as a chance to do some good.

"A mother and her daughter were killed, and her son was seriously injured Monday after a man attacked them with a baseball bat in their Florida home. The attacker, believed to have been the live-in boyfriend of the daughter, is said to have fled the house with the bat, before apparently drowning himself in a nearby lake. Neighbors claimed the suspected killer, James Earl Jones, struggled with mental health issues and had not been taking his medication. Scroll down for video . Attack: A mother and daughter were killed and her son was seriously injured after being beaten by a baseball bat at this Florida home Monday . Police were called to the home at about 4.30pm on Monday, where they found the body of one victim inside, and two seriously injured victims outside. One later died in hospital. They said the suspected killer was still holding the bat believed to have been used in the attack, but he dropped it and ran off. The victims were named Tuesday morning as Shannon Marie Ratliff, Mavis Ratliff and Eddie Dean Ratliff. Tavares spokeswoman Joyce Ross told Mail Online that an aluminum baseball bat had been used in the brutal attack. Ross confirmed that Jones's death was being treated as a suspected suicide, and said the investigation was on going. The body of Jones was found on Monday floating in Lake Dora. Early indications suggest he drowned himself, police said. Crime scene: Police tape cordons off the road leading up to the Ratliffs' house, where James Earl Jones allegedly attacked them . Investigation: Police have been collecting evidence from the family home as well as a nearby lake where Jones is believed to have drowned himself . Those involved in the tragic attack are said to have been aged from 40 to 55 and all shared the house.

"New Hampshire police have released a sketch of a man they believe may be connected to the disappearance of a 15-year-old, who went missing for nine months. Abigail Hernandez went missing on October 9 last year as she walked home from school just days before her 15th birthday. Police believe the man in the sketch may have driven the schoolgirl away in a blue pick up truck. She was safely reunited with her family Sunday. Safe: Abigail Hernandez has been reunited with her family nine months after she disappeared on her way home from school . Wanted: Police have released a sketch of a man suspected of driving away with the then 14-year-old Abigail . Based on information provided by Abigail, police say they are looking for a slightly overweight man with darkish skin, brown eyes, and stubble. He was described as being slightly taller than the 5ft 4in teenager. Few details have been released about Abigail's disappearance and where she has been for the past nine months. The only contact she had with her family was a letter believed to have been sent by the schoolgirl to her parents in the weeks after her disappearance. Although it didn't provide details on what had happened to her, the letter gave parents Zenya and Ruben Hernandez some hope that Abigail was at least still alive. Police are investigating whether the man in the sketch, or anyone else, was involved in the disappearance, and whether Abigail was taken against her will, or enticed away, and where she was kept for the past nine months. The bright schoolgirl was just 14 when she went missing, and had no means to provide food, shelter or other necessities. Hope: Abigail's frantic family received a letter from the teenager after she went missing, giving them faith that she was still alive . Missed: Abigail's family and New Hampshire community had been searching for the schoolgirl for months . Contact: Abigail Hernandez's mother Zenya, pictured left with the teenager's sister Sarah, wrote a Christmas letter to her daughter begging her to come home in December. She has now safely returned . New Hampshire police said it was a felony for any person to remove, detain or conceal a child under the age of 18, who is not a relative. If it is found that Abigail was removed against her will, or under the circumstances described by police, then appropriate charges will be brought. Attorney . General Foster said: 'We are all pleased Abigail was returned safely to . her family. Law enforcement officers must now obtain satisfactory . answers to the questions surrounding the facts and circumstances of . Abigail’s disappearance and nine-month absence.' He added: 'The . individual or individuals who were involved with her disappearance and . absence will now have to face the consequences of any unlawful actions.' On a Facebook page that was set up to try to help find Abigail, a statement was released asking supporters for their patience while the investigation continued. Returned: Abigail Hernandez, pictured in security footage on the day she disappeared, returned home Sunday . 'Many people have been requesting specific answers and details as to exactly what happened to Abby. While we appreciate the desire for answers, this is still very much an ongoing law enforcement investigation and no details can be released that could jeopardize the integrity of their work,' the post said. Previous details about the case, including details of the letter the Hernandez family had received, were also delayed to protect the investigation. Officials delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager. Law enforcement officials said at the time that although the letter had given them hope, they feared deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety. One FBI investigator had even suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to the young women in Cleveland, Ohio, who escaped after being held for ten years by Ariel Castro. When Abigail unexpectedly returned Sunday, her parents were overjoyed, with Mrs Hernandez saying they were 'the happiest people on earth'. Anyone who recognizes the man depicted in the sketch is asked to contact New Hampshire police at (603) 271-3636 or the Conway Police Department at (603) 356-5715.","Family reunited with Abigail on Sunday after her unexpected return .

"Young adults whose parents were strict, unaffectionate and demanding are more likely than their peers to become internet-addicts, a new study has found. Researchers say tough parenting can breed sad children who struggle to make friends, and those personality traits raises their risk of addiction. 'In short, good parenting, including parental warmth and affection, that is caring and protective parents, has been associated with lower risk for Internet addiction,' said lead author Argyroula E. Kalaitzaki of the Technological Education Institute (TEI) of Crete in Heraklion. Research: Young people whose parents were strict, unaffectionate and demanding are more likely than their peers to become internet addicts . 'Whereas bad parenting, including . parental control and intrusion, that is authoritarian and neglectful . parents, has been associated with higher risk for addiction.' Research on internet addiction is still relatively new, and there are no actual criteria for diagnosing the disorder, though there are many inpatient and outpatient treatment facilities in the U.S., Australia and Asia. Some of the studies done to date suggest that kids who have trouble relating to others in person might be at higher risk for a problematically high level of Internet use. Those who are socially withdrawn or lonely might also be more likely to spend excessive time online. Kalaitzaki's team predicted that the way kids bonded with their parents would predict aspects of their personality as young adults, which in turn would predict their likelihood of internet addiction. For the study, more than 700 young adults at technical schools, all around age 20, filled out questionnaires during class time. They answered questions about their feelings of loneliness, sadness and anxiety, and about their Internet use. They also answered questions about how they recalled being brought up during their first 16 years of life. Good parenting: Researchers found warm, caring and protective parents has been associated with lower risk for internet addiction . In Greece, previous studies have found that between one percent and eight percent of teens are addicted to the internet. The current study classified almost two percent of the men and 0.6 percent of the women as severely addicted, according to the results published in Addictive Behaviors. The authors did not find a link between anxiety or loneliness and Internet addiction, nor could they directly link any particular parenting style with addiction. But Kalaitzaki and her colleagues did find indirect connections. The kids who remembered their fathers as controlling and not affectionate tended to have more trouble relating to others as young adults, and those who had trouble relating to others were more likely to be addicted. Those who remembered their mothers as just not being very good parents were more likely to report sadness as young adults, which was also linked to Internet addiction. 'Parents should be made aware of the harmful impact that a potential negative parental rearing style may have upon their children in later life,' Kalaitzaki told Reuters Health. Kalaitzaki studies interpersonal relationships and psychotherapy in the Department of Social Work at TEI. Other international studies suggest that Internet addiction may harm a person's mental and physical health, she said. Those who go online excessively tend to be distressed, tense, nervous and irritable, and to have trouble sleeping and fatigue. Bad parenting: The study found that tough parenting can breed sad children who struggle to make friends, and those personality traits raises their risk of internet addiction . 'This discussion is of large interest for the technological society at large, given that Internet addiction is related to a medium present in virtually all homes and not regulated, like drugs of abuse,' George Floros, who studies the emerging addiction at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece, said. 'Parents would do well to examine the kind of model they present,' said Floros, an adjunct professor of medicine. 'Being preoccupied with technology to the detriment of social contacts is something we are seeing more frequently in young parents and this offers a negative model for their children.' Problematic parenting can go one of two ways, both of which might up the risk of Internet addiction in theory, he said. Overly permissive parents might use the Internet early on as a way to give up responsibility for the kids - an unattended child in front of a computer requires less effort from the parents than an active, present child. On the other hand, overly controlling parents can end up with kids who rebel or turn inwards, which might also lead to excessive Internet use, he said. 'Parents that identify their children to have some symptoms of addiction, like excessive time spent online or need to spend increasingly longer periods online, inadequate sleep and fatigue, apathy, nervousness, or irritability when offline, impairments in relationships and schoolwork or employment, should contact a health care professional as soon as possible,' Kalaitzaki said.","Research from the Technological Education Institute (TEI) of Crete found parenting style determines a young adult's risk of internet addiction .

"What do your favourite drinks look like, up close? To answer that question, Tallahassee company BevShots has revealed its latest ‘alcohol art’ images that reveal the psychedelic nature of drinks and cocktails, ranging from pina coladas to champagne. Using a microscope, the firm looked under the surface of popular beverages to unearth the unique colours, patterns and shapes that various drinks are made of. This microscopic picture of Irish Pale Lager was taken in the chemistry department of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida by local firm BevShots. These colorful pictures of alcoholic drinks reveal the incredible molecules that make up our favourite drinks . The striking images are the result of magnifying liquids up to 1,000 times under a powerful laboratory microscope at Florida State University. Police officers may soon have a powerful new tool in their campaign against drink drivers. A laser-based device has been developed that detects alcohol vapour inside a moving car, and it could track down reckless drivers who are over the limit. The system works by detecting tiny changes in the laser beam as it passes through vapour - and is capable of detecting alcohol at concentrations as low as 0.1 per cent. Each of the images is on offer as works of art for prospective buyers who want to examine what goes on inside various cocktails. The incredible shapes and colours of the artwork are then highlighted by shining natural light on top, and through, the bottom of the slide. The images are then taken using a 35-millimetre camera. In the images, the various crystalised carbohydrates that have become sugars and glucose are visible. Each picture is taken by using just a pipette of each particular drink, and placing it on a slide. This is then placed under a microscope, once the droplets have dried out, and a picture is taken. The process is not quick, however; it can take four weeks for the alcohol to dry out completely in an airtight container. This microscopic picture of English Oatmeal beer shows the remarkable structure of the drink. Each drink is referred to like a snowflake because, when magnified up to 1,000 times under an advanced laboratory microscope, none are ever the same . A microscopic picture of vodka tonic taken in the chemistry department of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. Produced by American firm Bevshots, the images are on offer as art works . In some cases the entire process of drying can take up to three months. And some alcohols are more difficult to shoot than others – vodka, for instance, does not have as many impurities as a pina colada cocktail. This means vodka does not always dry out properly, and it can take hundreds of attempts to get the right shot. Cocktails with fruit and soft drinks, however, have an abundance of citric acids and complex sugars that dry well and make them easier to photograph. 'BevShots are photographs of alcohol under a microscope,' the company writes on their website. 'These high-quality photographs of your favorite beers, wines, cocktails, liquors and mixers were taken after they were crytallised on a slide and shot under a polarised light microscope. 'As the light refracts through the beverage crystals, the resulting photos feature naturally magnificent colors and composition.' This image takes a microscopic look at champagne. To take the images it was necessary for the alcohol to be dried before it was put on a slide and placed under a microscope. Some types of alcohol, like cocktails, dry quickly and are easy to photograph. Others though, like vodka, are much more difficult as they have a lack of impurities . Tequila, shown here, is much darker than other drinks, due to the high levels of fructose in the tequila from the agave plant. Its colour may also be influenced by the high levels of essential oils, also from the agave plant. The amazing images show how different liquids can appear under the microscope when just a few key ingredients are changed . Here a dirty martini is seen under the microscope. The technique for making these photos dates back to the early 1990s. That was when a research scientist at Florida State University called Michael Davis used the method to get additional funding for his laboratory .","A company based in Tallahassee, Florida has revealed the latest images of their amazing 'alcohol art'

"Sleeping soundly beneath eye masks and blankets, Eurocrats make the 270-mile train journey from Belgium to France in a  farcical monthly move between the European Parliament’s  two headquarters. Nicknamed the gravy train or the Eurocrat Express, two privately-chartered trains shuttle 1,000 parliament staff from its main seat in Brussels to its ‘official’ home in Strasbourg for just four days a month. An estimated 360,000 man hours are lost every year when 3,000 staff and 766 MEPs relocate en masse to Strasbourg by car, train and plane. Getting some shut-eye: A total of 766 MEPs travel to Strasbourg for just two full working days every single month . The wasted hours are no more apparent than on board one of the two plush trains, which are exclusively chartered for parliamentary staff for half a million pounds a year. After the four-hour train journey, most of the highly-paid Eurocrats will not arrive at parliament until almost 3pm, when they will finally begin working. Just 72 hours later, they board a train home – having worked just two full days in France – while their documents and a fleet of cars are returned to Brussels. This second home costs taxpayers an estimated £150million annually, despite being deserted for 85 per cent of the year. Time to chat: Two Eurocrats share a beer as they travel, while another takes advantage of the downtime . During ‘Strasbourg week’, 2,500 trunks of documents are moved across the border in lorries at a cost of £250,000, and a fleet of black Mercedes are taken on transporters so they are waiting for MEPs when they arrive. Staff are put up in expensive hotels, which double in price when parliament is sitting, and receive generous expenses during their visit. The high-speed private train service, which boasts luxurious red velvet seats, was introduced in 2008 by President Nicolas Sarkozy. Senior officials who do not take the ‘train special’, as it is called, are able to use a privately-chartered jet which runs twice a week or a chauffeur-driven Mercedes. Paper trail: Eurocrats take 2,500 trunks of documents, taken over the border in lorries at a cost of £250,000 . MEPs voted three to one in favour of having just one parliament building in October last year. But the vote was fruitless because the Strasbourg agreement is written into the 1992 European Treaty. The governments for all of the 28 member countries must agree to any change in the treaty. France has made it clear that it would veto any such amendment – as Strasbourg rakes in an  estimated £17million a year for the French economy. Roger Helmer, Ukip MEP for the East Midlands, said: ‘Anyone can see that it is completely mad to have two headquarters instead of one at a cost of tens of millions of pounds a year. ‘But we will never be able to change it because it is written in the treaty and France will veto it every time. It stands as a metaphor for the whole European project which is full of things nobody can explain, that nobody can justify but, ultimately, that nobody can change.’ In session in Strasbourg: MEPs voted three to . one in favour of having just one parliament building in October last . year. But the vote was fruitless because the Strasbourg agreement is . written into the European Treaty . Ashley Fox, Conservative MEP for the South-West, said: ‘Hours and hours of people’s lives are going down the plughole each month travelling there. ‘It is a symbol of everything that is wrong with the EU. It duplicates an existing parliament, it achieves precisely nothing and it wastes money. ‘It is ridiculous that we only sit here for 48 days a year and yet there are 100 members of staff who are working full-time as cleaners, in security and in catering awaiting our return. ‘The lights are left on, the building is heated, the floors are cleaned – all for no one.’ But French MEP Alain Cadec said: ‘It is true that the majority of MEPs are opposed to this, but it is not them who get to decide, it is the governments.’ Plus, he added with a smile, ‘I live in Brittany so it is very convenient for me’.","Some 360,000 man hours are lost each year by the monthly relocation .

"They had saved for more than a year for their dream holiday. So the Raine family were devastated when one of their passports disappeared at check-in just minutes after they had handed it over – forcing them to abandon their £5,500 trip to Florida. Alan Raine, 54, believes the check-in worker at Manchester airport knocked the passport on to the baggage conveyor and that it disappeared into the maze of the airport’s luggage system. Scroll down for video . Grounded: Alan Raine (second from right) and his family missed out on their dream holiday to Florida . When he suggested this, he was told it was ‘impossible’ – but his theory gained some weight when the passport turned up the next day on a baggage carousel at arrivals. Mr Raine had spent 13 months planning the two-week trip and had booked tickets to theme parks including Universal Studios for himself and his wife Yvette, 49, their 28-year-old son Ashley, grandson Ryan, eight, and Mrs Raine’s retired parents Malcolm and Yvonne Bowes, who are 74 and 73. He said: ‘We are just gutted. I don’t know when we will get to go back now as it is not just the money from the flights we have lost, it is the rest of the trip too.’ Mr Raine, a council worker, said he feared that it was the family’s last chance to go away together because his father-in-law’s health is deteriorating. 'Sorry': United Airlines says it will contact the family and offer a gesture of goodwill . He added that he was furious about the reaction of United Airlines, which was operating the flight, claiming the family is yet to receive an apology. ‘We are annoyed at the way they have gone about it,’ he said. ‘They have told us they are investigating but we haven’t heard anything. They don’t seem interested. ‘I was just flabbergasted at the attitude of the staff. I actually said to them: “Do you realise what we are losing here?”’ The family, from Bishop Auckland, County Durham, had already shown all six of their passports at a minor security check when they arrived at the airport last Monday. But when they handed over the documents at check-in, they were stunned when the worker said Ashley’s was missing. After they complained, the family were told that an employee of Swissport, which runs the airport’s baggage system, would carry out a ‘thorough search’. But Mr Raine said this lasted for only two minutes. Ashley Raine's missing passport turned up on the baggage carousel in arrivals the next day . When the passport could not be found, they were offered later flights if they could get an emergency passport, but Mr Raine said it was impossible to get a new one in time. The Raines had to abandon the trip because they did not want to leave Ashley, a civil engineer, behind, especially as it would leave Ryan without his father. A spokesman for United Airlines said: ‘We are sorry to hear about the disruption to the Raines’ family travel plans following the loss of a passport at Manchester airport. ‘United will contact the customer to offer a gesture of goodwill.’ The Raines said they have yet to be contacted by the airline. Swissport said: ‘United Airlines is investigating what has happened in association with Swissport, and when this is completed they will be in touch with the family.’","Alan Raine said the family of six saved for over a year to pay for the trip .

"Argentina has refused to relocate its lonely polar bear to a wildlife park that specializes in the species, despite a petition by more than half a million people. Animal rights activists had been calling on the 28-year-old animal to be moved to a zoo in Winnipeg, Canada, over claims that it was showing signs of stress. But Gustavo Pronotto, director of Mendoza Zoo, said Tuesday that the bear, named Arturo, is too elderly to make the nearly 6,000-mile journey. Scroll down for video . Denied: Despite a high-profile campaign to move him, Arturo the polar bear is to remain in a zoo in Argentina . Depressed: Animal advocates have claimed the 28-year-old polar bear is showing signs of stress after his partner died two years ago . Pronotto said that to make the two-day journey, Arturo would have to be sedated which carries risk for an animal his age. 'Arturo is close to his caretakers. We just want everyone to stop bothering the bear,' he said. He added that the behaviors which others had highlighted as signs that the animal was in distress were merely down to his age. A team of vets in Argentina ruled in February that the polar bear should remain in the zoo. Arturo's plight came to the attention of animal rights advocates, who dubbed him 'the world's saddest animal' when they launched a petition to call for him to be moved. The polar bear has been alone in his enclosure since his partner, Pelusa, died of cancer in 2012. Visitors to the zoo, and animal experts, had reported seeing him pacing nervously in his concrete enclosure, and appearing to struggle with the high temperatures. Concerns: Mendoza Zoo officials say the bear is too elderly to make the journey from Argentina to Canada . Alone: Arturo is the only polar bear in Argentina and has shown signs of depression . Hope: Campaigners wanted Arturo moved to Assiniboine Zoo, above, which has a large plunge pool and spacious enclosure for its bears . Friends: Arturo is the only polar bear in Argentina, but if the zoo had allowed him to relocate he could have interacted with others at the Canadian zoo, above . He has been seen tilting his head and showing his teeth while pacing back and forth, and rocking from side to side - all behaviors widely believed to be symptoms of stress. Greenpeace and other environmental groups argue that it is riskier to keep the bear in Mendoza, where . temperatures can reach up to 86F in the summer. The last polar bear to die in Argentina did so during a heatwave in 2012. Currently, Arturo has only a shallow pool, said to be only 20in deep, to provide cooling water. But Assiniboine Zoo in Winnipeg, where campaigners wanted the bear moved, has a ten-acre facility that provides as natural an environment as possible for polar bears. Its $84 million Journey to Churchill exhibit focuses on education and conservation, and the polar bears living there have more space to roam and a more natural setting. And, when temperatures in Winnipeg get too hot for the arctic creatures, the zoo's bears have access to a deep, rocky pool. The Sea Ice Passage is 21 metres long, 3 metres wide and 2.5 metres deep and, while the bears dive and splash around, visitors can watch them through a tunnel that goes underneath the exhibit. Flat out: Arturo sits in a concrete enclosure at Mendoza Zoo in Argentina in temperatures of up to 104F and is said to have been depressed since his long-term friend Pelusa died two years ago . Observations: Experts claim the 28-year-old's lonely life is causing him to display 'abnormal behavior', including tilting his head and showing his teeth while pacing back and forth and rocking from side to side . Thick coat: Animal rights activists now want Arturo - whose only access to cooling water in his enclosure is said to be a pool just 20in (50cm) deep - moved to another zoo that offers cooler conditions . For Arturo, it would have been a . chance to experience something closer to the wild, and to have . interaction with his own species for the first time in two years. 'His current living situation is very sad, and he deserves to be saved,' a statement on the Change petition site said. The petition called on Argentina's President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, to give her approval for the bear to be moved. The campaign has quickly gathered in momentum, with more than half a million supporters signing the petition by Tuesday. It . has also been given support by U.S. politicians, including former House . Speaker Newt Gingrich, who highlighted the case on his Facebook page. Under . a video clip showing the depressed-looking polar bear, Gingrich wrote: . 'If you love animals the way I do, please sign the petition to help the . Argentinian polar bear, Arturo.' Still in Argentina: Mendoza Zoo blocked an effort five months ago to move Assiniboine Park Zoo in Canada . Heavy: At Mendoza Zoo, Arturo is served 33lb of meat per day, and all the fruit and vegetables he can eat. He also loves honey. And if his caretakers are late, Arturo growls to draw their attention . The singer Cher, also backed the bear on Twitter, posting: ‘Don’t cry for him, Argentina? No . tears of Mrs Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner for tortured polar bear . Arturo. Your hands are stained with his blood when he dies.’ Mariana . Caram of environmental group OIKOS-Red Ambiental, said her organization . was trying to challenge the findings of the vet panel that recommended . the bear should stay. 'I . saw the bear last Thursday. He came out and he swam just a bit. He’s . walking very slowly,' she said. 'They’ve expanded his pool but they . still have yet to give him the room he needs to walk.' Zoo director Pronotto has said that considering Arturo's age, he was in ‘good condition’, and that the life expectancy of one of the animals is just over 20 years - but in captivity, they often live to 30. ‘We must avoid a big mistake, like his death during the trip or upon arrival. One must evaluate the risks carefully. He is old, and this would require many hours of anesthesia,' he said. Sad case: Arturo - Spanish for Arthur - has been at the zoo for two decades, and has had no contact with his own kind since Pelusa died. Now, campaigners are worried that he is suffering mental health issues . Campaign: Singer Cher tweeted her support for the campaign to help Arturo . Greenpeace had gathered 160,000 . signatures in a campaign to transfer Arturo urgently to Canada, which it . said has weather that more closely resembles what occurs in his natural . habitat. Argentinian . professor Fernanda Arentsen, who teaches at Université de Saint-Boniface . in Winnipeg, has written to her government and the Canadian Embassy in . Buenos Aires over the issue. She . told the Winnipeg Free Press last year: ‘You can see he is going crazy. He moves the way polar bears do when they are suffering a lot of . stress. ‘He has been filmed rocking back and forth in a way that signals distress. It breaks my heart to see it. I’m from Mendoza. I know how hot summer is. There is no way for him to escape the heat. Not going: Greenpeace had gathered 160,000 signatures in a campaign to transfer Arturo urgently to Canada, which it said has weather that more closely resembles what occurs in his natural habitat . ‘He looks so sad. He looks in pain. You can imagine a polar bear in the desert with a swimming pool 50cm deep. It’s difficult to watch this poor animal suffering and in pain.’ Arturo, a 900lb (400kg) bear born in the U.S. in 1985, arrived in 1993 in Mendoza, a city of 120,000 at the foot of the Andes, known for its wine production. At Mendoza Zoo, Arturo is served 33lb of meat per day, and all the fruit and vegetables he can eat. He also loves honey. And if his caretakers are late, Arturo growls to draw their attention. As the zoo’s mascot, he has an air-conditioned 375 sq ft enclosure, a 5,400 sq ft beach and a swimming pool in which his guards throw blocks of ice to keep it cool. A spokesman for Mendoza Zoo did not immediately respond to a MailOnline request for comment.","Zoo directors say 28-year-old animal is too old to make two-day journey .

"Jackie Kennedy hated Martin Luther King so much she could barely look at photographs of him. In interviews taped in 1964 but only just released, she said the black civil rights leader was a ‘terrible man’ and a ‘phoney’. She claimed King bragged of being drunk at her husband John F Kennedy’s funeral and had been caught trying to set up an orgy. Claims: Jacqueline Kennedy was said to have seen Martin Luther King as a 'terrible' man . The interviews also revealed that JFK . was so worried about vice-president Lyndon Johnson succeeding him that . he schemed with his brother Robert to stop it happening. Seven conversations between Mrs . Kennedy and Arthur Schlesinger, a historian and Kennedy aide, were taped . in the months after the president’s assassination on November 22, 1963. Their release is timed to mark the . 50th anniversary of the Kennedy-era administration, where the White . House became known as ‘Camelot’. Doubts: The newly-revealed memoirs of Jackie Kennedy (left), tell how JFK scorned the idea of Lyndon Johnson (right) being president . Worried: JFK, pictured here with Lyndon Johnson in 1960, was said to have had concerns about what would happen if his former rival and Vice-President took office . Mrs Kennedy said her view of   King . was formed after being told of secret FBI wiretaps which showed him . trying to organise a sex party before he attended the March on . Washington in August 1963, at which he delivered his ‘I Have a Dream’ speech. She said her brother-in-law Robert told her that King made . disparaging remarks about JFK at the funeral and about Cardinal Richard . Cushing, who delivered the eulogy. ‘I just can’t see a picture of Martin . Luther King without thinking, you know, that man’s terrible,’ she said. Skeptical: JFK was said to have thought that U.S. participation in Vietnam was 'hopeless', according to newly-released interviews with Jacqueline Kennedy . John and Jackie Kennedy with daughter Caroline, who allowed the tapes to be released to ABC in return for their cancelling of the mini series about the family . Texas-born Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in as U.S. president on November 22, 1963, around two hours after JFK was assassinated at 12.30pm. Johnson had been in the car behind Kennedy when the assassination took place. Despite initial fears he had also been shot or suffered a heart attack, Johnson was not hurt and was instead rushed from Dallas to Washington amid fears he may be targeted. Flanked by Jacqueline Kennedy on Air Force One two hours later, Johnson was inaugurated as president by Federal Judge Sarah T Hughes - the first time a woman had administered the presidential oath. After Air Force One landed at Andrews Air Force Base, Washington, President Johnson gave a speech at 6.10pm, less than seven hours after JFK's death. He said: 'This is a sad time for all people. We have suffered a loss that cannot be weighed. For me, it is a deep personal tragedy. 'I know that the world shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy and her family bear. I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help--and God's.' ‘He made fun of Cardinal Cushing and . said that he was drunk at it [the funeral] – and things about they . almost dropped the coffin. I mean Martin Luther King is really a tricky . person.’ She said Robert told her of the FBI . wiretaps: ‘He said this with no bitterness or anything, how he was . calling up all these girls and arranging for a party of men and women, I . mean, sort of an orgy.’ Over the seven sessions, Mrs Kennedy . recalled conversations on topics ranging from her husband’s reading . habits to the botched Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. But the sharpest criticism was for . Johnson, who John F Kennedy chose as his running mate in 1960. Mrs . Kennedy said her husband would say to her: ‘Oh, God, can you ever . imagine what would happen to the country if Lyndon were president? ‘And Bobby told me that he’d had some discussions with him ... do something to name someone else in 1968.’ Johnson was sworn in as president . after JFK’s assassination and won a full term for himself in 1964. He . declined to seek re-election in 1968. Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John . and Jackie, said her mother’s comments about King were evidence of the . ‘poisonous’ activities of then FBI director J  Edgar Hoover. She said the comments didn’t reflect . her mother’s true feelings about King, pointing out that she was proud . to attend his funeral following his assassination in April 1968. She added: ‘The description of Lyndon . Johnson here is more of his capabilities as a president, more negative . than she certainly felt about him as a person.’ In June, an extract of one of the . interviews had Mrs Kennedy saying her husband felt his legacy would be . secured if he was assassinated after his Cuban missile crisis success of . 1962. ‘If anyone’s going to kill me, it should happen now,’ he supposedly said. Professor Robert Dallek, a Kennedy era . historian, has said JFK’s remark may have been inspired by the . assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In the tapes, Jackie allegedly blames President . Lyndon Johnson for the death of JFK, who took over the post from her . husband after his assassination .","Former first lady believed King made derogatory remarks at JFK's funeral .

"Treat 'em mean: Researchers say there are evolutionary reasons why we are standoffish to loved ones . For generations, suitors have suspected that playing hard to get is a feminine wile dreamt up solely to try their patience. It seems, however, that there are sound evolutionary reasons why treating a man mean is the best way to keep him keen. According to psychologists who examined a host of much-used strategies, women blow hot and cold with a possible partner to test his commitment and quality. Researchers analysed 58 infuriating strategies used by women playing hard to get. They ranged from flirting with others and being ‘snooty’ to letting a suitor’s call divert to voicemail. The study, reported in the  European Journal of Personality, asked more than 1,500 men and women which tactics worked best. The most successful feminine wiles included appearing highly self-confident, talking to other people, withholding sex, sarcasm, sounding busy, teasing, flirting with others and turning down the first few dates. Overall, women were more likely than men to play hard to get, the researchers from the University of Western Sydney and Singapore Management University discovered. The researchers suggested  that was because women are trying to ensure a potential mate will stand by them once they have a child. Phillip Hodson, a fellow of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and author of Men, An Investigation into the Emotional Male, told The Independent: 'This study blends traditional thinking with some modern. 'To get her man in the 1950s movie The Pajama Game, professional virgin Doris Day withholds sex until her underlying contractual demands are met. 'But psychologists and therapists would call this strategy outdated on the grounds that she'd most likely attract an incompatible mate who would tire of her once the challenge had vanished.'

"After ditching his ambitions to be Mayor of New York City, Anthony Weiner appears to have swapped politics for pans. The Democrat, who also resigned from Congress in 2011 over a sexting scandal, has been linked to a restaurant venture to help the city's unemployed. He has been spotted apparently looking for locations for the Rockaway Restoration Kitchen, which is billing itself as a locally sourced eatery staffed by former addicts and prisoners. Career change: Anthony Weiner, pictured at a food pantry in Queens in November, has been linked to plans for a Rockaway restaurant . Health drive: Weiner enjoys a Nathan's hotdog in Coney Island. The Queens restaurant he is linked to plans to bring healthy options to an area known as a 'food desert' Although the restaurant is still in the early stages of planning, it is expected to be based in Rockaway, Queens, which is considered a 'food desert' when it comes to healthy places to eat. The area also has high unemployment, and suffered serious damage during Hurricane Sandy. Weiner has not commented on his involvement with the project, but the Rockaway Times claims several people have said he has been looking for a suitable location for it. After stepping down from the mayoral race last year, Weiner had said he planned to move out of politics. In November Weiner, who describes himself as 'a fighter for those struggling to make it', appeared in the New York Post when he volunteered at a food kitchen. The Rockaway Restoration Kitchen is an ambitious project to try to breathe life into a neglected neighborhood while giving a second chance to the unemployed. Hope: Weiner helps at a food pantry in Queens, which has high unemployment and limited food options . The company's website states: 'Our goal is to provide a comfortable neighborhood restaurant with healthy, locally sourced food that satisfies the hunger of Rockaway residents, attracts visitors and serves up dignity and self-sufficiency by serving as a hands on training ground.' The restaurant will work with social services to find suitable candidates for its training program, many of whom may have struggled to find work because of drug addiction or previous convictions. Weiner has not yet responded to a MailOnline request for comment.","Anthony Weiner believed to be involved in Rockaway Restoration Kitchen .
