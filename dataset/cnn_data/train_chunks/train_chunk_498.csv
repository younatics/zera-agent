Police are on the hunt for an ice-cold assassin who executed three men on the streets of New York before casually strolling past two police commands in his getaway. Video surveillance shows the suspect in grey sweatpants and a white T-shirt, walking calmly after shooting his three victims execution style in a parked BMW in Manhattan over what police suspect was a drug retaliation. 'He walked away, did not run,' NYPD Spokesman Paul Browne told the Wall Street Journal of the suspect described as Hispanic and seen walking a half-mile from the crime scene. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Video surveillance shows this triple-murder suspect coolly walking about a half a mile away from where he shot his victims . Captured: The unidentified male, described as Hispanic, is seen before he ditched his white t-shirt in a trash bin just after the shooting . Just around the corner the suspect tossed his white shirt in a corner bin on Broadway and La Salle Street, the New York Post reports. Attracting just as little attention during the shooting, taking place around 5.30pm, the victims' bodies weren't discovered for at least another hour by a pedestrian. With two men in the front seat and one in back, all were shot without bullet holes hitting the car, prompting investigators to initially believe the shooter was inside with them. Amaury Rodriguez, 31, Heriberto Suazo, 26, and Luis Catalan, 25, were shot multiple times in the skull and body, execution-style, at the Morningside Heights neighbourhood near Columbia University. The men, discovered on Thursday evening near the Ivy League college, all had lengthy criminal records as they switched between robbing drug dealers or getting robbed by them. Killed: Amaury Rodriguez (left) and Heriberto Suazo (right) were two of three men shot dead in a BMW near Columbia University in what may have been a retaliation as they were known for robbing drug dealers . The $88,000 car was parked near the intersection of W. 122nd Street and Claremont Avenue, between the Union Theological Seminary and Riverside Church, DNAInfo reported. Authorities said they believe a gunman used a revolver to shoot the victims because no shell casings were found. Police said they believe the gunman first killed Catalan, sitting on the right, back seat, by shooting him in the left temple and side, the New York Post reported. Then driver Rodriguez died next followed by Suazo, who was sitting in the front passenger seat as they were both shot behind the ears. Bloody scene: Three men were found dead in a brand new BMW near Columbia University and the Manhattan School of Music . Police believe the car had been parked for a maximum of an hour when it was discovered. The high-end vehicle had temporary registration stickers and appeared to be stolen, according to the New York Daily News. Catalan had been arrested at least 10 times for charges ranging from marijuana possession and driving without a license, the Daily News reported. Suazo was arrested late last year for having 12 pounds of marijuana and loaded guns. Rodriguez served two years in state prison for gun charges, according to the Daily News. No 911 calls were made to report any shootings and no students at the university claimed to hear any gunfire. 'This was a classic triple assassination,' said one source to the New York Post.’ 'The shooter had to be a cool customer to kill three men so close to him. He was quick and deadly.' Searching for clues: NYPD officers and detectives investigate inside and around the vehicle; all three victims were shot in the skull . One source told the Post that the attack, which happened during the day, was ‘a very bloody scene. 'Shooting three people in a car is extremely loud and the shooter may . have used a silencer,' said a police source. And 'he may have plugged . his ears.' Hours later, it was reported that 'blood was still dripping' from the car as it sat outside the university's Knox Hall. Police blocked off a wide area around the triple homicide after the bodies were found. ‘Both men in the front seat were wearing white T-shirts, both drenched in blood,’ said a police spokesman. Disturbing the peace: The three men were found on W. 122nd Street near Claremont Avenue, a generally quiet area within Morningside Heights . Addressing: NYPD Deputy Commissioner speaks to reporters about the bloody crime . The police were alerted around 6.30pm by a man walking by the scene who saw the two men in the front seat of the car appeared to be dead. Sources told the Post that they weren’t believed to have been students of the music school or at Columbia. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told reporters that authorities will go through surveillance video in hopes of putting the pieces together. Students in the area were badly shaken by the incident. The area, which is full of students from several of the schools and universities around, is generally considered a very safe area of Manhattan.

'Big Bad Wolf': Antonio Gobbato stood trial accused of sexually assaulting six 'patients' A bogus GP who called himself the ‘Big Bad Wolf’ faces jail after he was found guilty yesterday of sexually assaulting four women. Antonio Gobbato, 51, used a cosmetic spatula to examine patients, and told one victim she was not pregnant after tweaking her nipples. Brazilian-born Gobbato convinced three parents their children needed expensive and urgent medical treatment abroad, conning the families into paying for ‘all expenses paid’ trips to Italy. He told one anxious father his daughter could contract leukaemia, and another mother: ‘You have to go to Italy next week, this boy is going to lose a kidney and it’s going to be your fault.’ Calling himself an ‘NHS doctor, gynaecologist, paediatrician and a psychiatrist’, he fooled victims with his white coat, framed certificates, a stethoscope and microscope he kept in his surgery. Yesterday a jury at Inner London Crown Court convicted him of five charges of sexual assault in respect of four patients, and three fraud charges. Judge Peter Grobel adjourned sentence but Gobbato, of Pinner, North London, is likely to face years behind bars. His first trial had collapsed in May last year after he had what was thought to be a minor stroke. But Judge Grobel later ruled he was fit to plead and stand trial, saying: ‘Medical experts for both the prosecution and the defence are in agreement that sadly the defendant is malingering.’ The court heard that Gobbato referred to himself as the ‘Big Bad Wolf’ in messages while arranging trips to Italy. One woman paid for him to accompany her family to Italy so he could treat her husband’s alcoholism. When the husband pulled out of the trip, Gobbato said her daughter should go instead for treatment of depression. He racked up a £726 bill for flights on her credit card, plus food, accommodation and car hire, jurors heard. But far from helping them in Italy, he made three visits to his dentist. The 51-year-old's 'consultation room' in south London, where the police fear he may have 'treated' up to 700 patients . Linda Strudwick, prosecuting, said: ‘That this whole process was a charade to fleece money from [this woman] becomes very clear when one views the text sent by Mr Gobbato to someone who appears to be his secretary or wife, called Christina, in Italy.’ The text said: ‘Our hero did not want to travel. I am going with [the daughter] and her mother. I have to invent some treatment for them. X papao (Big Bad Wolf).’ Another woman, who flew from Brazil to give evidence, was studying at Westminster University in 2009 when she met Gobbato. She told the court that when she visited his office he had said she was depressed simple because she was wearing a black outfit on a sunny day. Gobbato then pricked her finger and looked at her blood under his microscope before asking to see her breasts. ‘I was wearing a bra but he pulled them out of it and started squeezing my nipples, very hard. It was very painful,’ she said. ‘Then he said, “Don’t worry, you are not pregnant”. I felt really awkward. I just wanted to get out of there, and that was when I realised he was not a doctor.’ Police believe Gobbato could have claimed hundreds of victims. Speaking after he was convicted, Detective Superintendent Andy Craig said: ‘We spoke to 160 women, but he said he treated up to 700.’","Brazilian-born Antonio Gobbato, 51, was today convicted of sexual assault and fraud .

Too many women are being singled out for strip searches at Gatwick airport, an official report has discovered. John Vine, the Government’s chief inspector of immigration, also found that especially numbers of Afro-Caribbean women are being searched. Mr Vine studied the conduct of Border Force staff working in the immigration and customs departments at the airport’s North Terminal last summer. The Government¿s chief inspector of immigration has found women are 'singled out' for strip searches at Gatwick Airport in West Sussex . He found irregularities in the way searches were conducted and that many searches were not properly recorded. His report says: 'Although the majority of person searches involved men, women were significantly more likely to be subject to a strip search than men if a search was undertaken.' His research revealed that 54 per cent of women who were stopped and inspected were later strip searched compared with only 20 per cent of men. Reasons given by Border Force staff for strip-searching women were that they had bought a ticket only the day before travel, were carrying 200-pounds in cash or said they were visiting Britain to look for hair and beauty products. Mr Vine said there were often 'insufficient grounds' for women even to be stopped in the first place and certainly not sufficient for a strip search to be conducted. The report says: 'The failure to observe the correct recording procedure can render evidence inadmissible in court and mean officers could face charges of assault in relation to the conduct of person searches.' Research revealed that 54 per cent of women who were stopped and inspected were later strip searched compared with only 20 per cent of men . John Vine's report also found irregularities in the way searches were conducted and that many searches were not properly recorded at Gatwick (file picture) The report reveals that a gay passenger was subject to discriminatory treatment because he was with a boyfriend and an officer believed 'he might be involved in paedophilia'. It says: 'The officer then commented to another officer that the passenger was HIV positive. The colleague then advised that the searching officer should use stronger hand gel. 'These comments were made within earshot of the passenger and indeed other passengers in the channel.' A Border Force spokesman said: 'We are disappointed that the inspector will not share details of the individual cases so that the Border Force can investigate and take further action as necessary. 'We have already addressed the Chief Inspector’s recommendations by introducing additional training for staff on issues of discrimination; we take discriminatory practice very seriously and have procedures in place to deal with any complaints.' The Border Force is now believed to have carried out a shake-up in the way searches are recorded. Guidance issued to staff at airports at airports is also being rewritten.","Report finds irregularities in the way searches were conducted .

A young British man who could face a firing squad after being caught selling less than an ounce of cannabis has been revealed to be the son of a businessman. Nathaniel Lees, 23,  was sentenced to death alongside his 19-year-old Syrian accomplice in a court in the strict Muslim emirate of Abu Dhabi. He is the son of British businessman Martin Lees, who is the director of GTS Training Solutions, a . British company registered in the Isle of Man and based in Abu Dhabi. It is unclear whether Nathaniel Lees was caught selling the marijuana with a street value of £262 to a detective posing as a customer or a Syrian man. The company provides staff training to oil and gas companies. Known as . Nathan, Lees is currently in Abu Dhabi Central Prison, about an hour from the city . centre according to The Daily Telegraph. His identity had been kept secret under local laws. Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Held: Known as Nathan, Lees is currently in Abu Dhabi Central Prison (pictured) about an hour from the city centre . Despite being a multicultural city it adheres to the strict Muslim laws of the country. The last execution to be carried out . in the UAE was in February last year, when a man convicted of the rape . and murder of a child was sentenced to death by firing squad. The judge in his case claimed that Lees was an experienced drug dealer who . was also selling opium and heroin, but it appears that no evidence of this appears . to have been produced in court. After the verdict in Abu Dhabi’s Criminal Court earlier this month Lees's mother Abeba Gebebramlak, who is of Eritrean origin, collapsed outside court. Born in Jeddah, where his father worked for the Saudi Yanbu . Petrochemical Company, Lees has lived most of his life in the United Arab . Emirates. The son of a British businessman, Nathaniel Lees, 23, was sentenced to death alongside his 19-year-old Syrian accomplice in a court in the strict Muslim emirate of Abu Dhabi . While Lees's case file describes him as an 'electrician', he seems to . have had no regular job and no education beyond secondary school. Asked on the social networking website MySpace whether he wanted to go . to college, he replied: 'LOL [laugh out loud]. Just ask if I want to . goto [sic] a 4 year party instead.' Lees' cases file shows he has previously had contact with the local police and showed a prior charge of possessing drugs. The newspaper reported that on his MySpace profile he wrote: 'In the past month, . have you been on drugs?"" he asks himself. 'If I had access to drugs, . would I be on MySpace?' is his reply. Verdict: The young British national was sentenced to death by firing squad at Abu Dhabi Criminal Court . When he was questioned on his first thoughts when waking . up, Lees wrote: 'F---, where did I put my pipe.' A Sudanese man, who was also a defendant, was sentenced to one year in jail and deportation for taking the drug, while a 17-year-old Emirati was sent for rehabilitation. Previously in court, defence lawyers had attacked the credibility of the police investigations, because the witness said he did not know the address of the defendants. He also said that the Syrian asked the Briton to get him the drugs from the car in Arabic, which lawyers said did not make sense. The last execution to be carried out in . the UAE was in February last year, when a man convicted of the rape and . murder of a child was sentenced to death by firing squad. In the UAE, executions are always . carried out by firing squad made up of eight gunmen so the executioners . remain ignorant of who fired the fateful shot. An Foreign & Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: . 'We can confirm that a British national is facing the death penalty in the United Arab Emirates. 'We will remain in close contact with the individual, their family and legal representative and continue to provide them with the appropriate consular assistance.' The conservative UAE has made news recently with crackdowns on tourists and foreign workers . The conservative UAE has a history of cracking down on the many foreigners who live there for indecent or 'un-Islamic' behaviour. Earlier this year, a British landscape architect has been fined after he asked colleagues in a meeting: 'When will we finish with the damn mosques?' John Hall, 42, the former Millennium Dome site planner, works for the parks and recreation section of Abu Dhabi Municipality, and was appealing against a one-month prison sentence imposed by the Court of Misdemeanours. Mr Hall’s lawyer persuaded the judge that the word damn could mean ‘strong criticism in an unofficial way’ and he was fined £840 instead. In 2010, a British woman who made a rape complaint in Dubai was arrested for having illegal sex with her fiance. The woman, a 23-year-old from London, said she was raped by a waiter in a luxury hotel after celebrating her engagement to her 44-year-old boyfriend, also from London. But when she reported the alleged rape to police in the Middle Eastern state she and her boyfriend were arrested for having sex outside marriage and illegal drinking outside licensed premises. Later that year, another British woman was arrested for wearing a bikini at a Dubai mall. The woman, a holidaymaker, was charged with indecency in Dubai after walking through the world's largest shopping centre in a bikini. The woman was buying clothes and gifts in the Dubai Mall, fully dressed but in a low-cut top, when she was accosted by an Arabic woman and criticised for wearing 'revealing clothing'. The mall's security team then intervened and called the police, who arrested the British holidaymaker.","Nathaniel Lees - known as Nathan - is currently in Abu Dhabi Central Prison, an hour from the city centre .

With Ann Curry’s days as a Today show co-host numbered, it has been revealed that NBC will pony up the dough - $10million in total - just to cut her loose. Curry, 55, returned to the venerable news programme again this morning, days after rumours of her imminent departure first began to swirl. It is believed that Curry will make the exit this week, but it won’t come cheap for NBC. Brave face: Ann Curry resumed her co-hosting duties on Monday, despite reports that she is being pushed out of the job - a move which will cost NBC $10miilion . The New York Post reported that Curry is in the midst of a three-year, $20million contract that she signed last year - a deal which guarantees her $10million in her final year. Co-host Matt Lauer, the highest paid TV newsman, makes about $25million a year after signing an epic deal in March to stay with the show. Despite the Today show firing, Curry won’t be booted from 30 Rock completely, as Curry is expected to be transferred back to her original love of foreign reporting  for the network. Reports surfaced late Wednesday that Curry, who took over the anchor chair June 9, 2011, would be removed from her spot as Matt Lauer's co-host before the network's Olympic coverage begins next month. On the air: Curry, centre, is pictured this morning at the Today show anchor desk, where she has been since last year . Team: Ms Curry, pictured with co-hosts Al Roker, Matt Lauer and Natalie Morales, is being axed to make way for the fresh blood that NBC hopes can reinvigorate its flagship property . The gossip hasn't intimidated Curry, who has continued coming to work, keeping a brave face amid the tension. This morning was no different. Conan O'Brien: When Tonight show ratings took a dip after Conan O’Brien took over hosting duties from Jay Leno, the ginger-haired funnyman was offered $45million to step aside for Leno's return. O’Brien also fought for - and won - his staff, many of whom  had uprooted their lives in New York to follow O'Brien to California. Matt Lauer: He was already the highest paid newsman when he was offered an $8million raise to stay on as host of the Today show. He now makes about $25million a year. Ann Curry: She's on her way out due to her lack of chemistry with Lauer. But NBC will reportedly have to pay her the $10million her contract guarantees in her final year. Keith Olbermann: It could be a huge payout for the former news host, who was fired from Al Gore’s Current TV in April. He claims the network still owes him about $70million – and he's suing to get it. Current has filed a counter suit. Piers Morgan: Taking over for a television icon like Larry King is a tough job, and the paycheck shows it. Morgan takes home roughly $2million a year - about a third of what his predecessor made doing Larry King Live. Both Curry and the network remain mum on the subject. Curry has taken the blame from many at NBC for the Today show's ratings decline. The program lost the top spot among network morning shows this spring, a position it had held, unbroken, since 1995. Part of the problem is a lack of . chemistry with Lauer, who had great on-air chemistry with Curry's . predecessors Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira. It . is making for another awkward transition at a network that prides . itself on smooth ones, recalling the memorable few weeks shortly before . Conan O'Brien was booted as host of the Tonight show in favour of Jay . Leno’s return. When she appeared on the air Thursday, Curry had one apparently unintentional indignity piled on. She was on camera at one point when a graphic flashed beneath her face that read: 'Here Today, Gone Tomorrow.' But that same day, Today had its . biggest audience of the week, just under 4.5 million, and its biggest . margin of victory over Good Morning America, according to preliminary . ratings by the Nielsen Co. Meanwhile, . the Ladies' Home Journal released excerpts of an interview Curry had . conducted earlier for the magazine's August cover story, where she said . it was hard not to take it personally when questions about her . performance surfaced during this spring's ratings competition with ABC. Together again: Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira were reunited as co-hosts at Buckingham Palace while cover the Queen's Jubilee clebration for the Today show . Following in the footsteps: Katie Couric, left, and Meredith Vieira are two of Today's best-known former anchors . Good Morning America in April ended a Today winning streak in the ratings that stretched back to 1995 and has won three other weeks since. 'You worry, am I not good enough?' Curry told the magazine. 'Am I not what people need? Am I asking the right questions. When people say negative things or speculate, you can't help but feel hurt.' She said she'd love to be on 'Today' for 20 years. She started as a news anchor in 1997.","Curry, 55, returned to work today despite reports of her firing .

"PUBLISHED: . 05:23 EST, 24 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:50 EST, 25 June 2012 . The drug being blamed for a spate of cannibal attacks in the U.S. is entering the country from the UK. Horrific assaults in which users of a substance known as 'bath salts' have eaten victims' flesh have given rise to speculation that America is in the throes of a 'zombie apocalypse'. Getting hold of the drug via the internet can be shockingly easy, requiring just a few clicks of the mouse and no proof of age, a U.S. news channel discovered. Scroll down for video . First attack: Fears of a zombie epidemic spread after Miami police shot Rudy Eugene (left) dead as he chewed off the face of homeless Ronald Poppo (right) Bath salts have been linked to a number of disturbing cases over the past month - including that of Rudy Eugene, who was shot dead by police as he bit off most of his homeless victim's face. Officers in Miami opened fire after Eugene ignored their orders to stop, snarling at them as he stood over 65-year-old Ronald Poppo, who was left partially blind. Earlier this month, two attacks in one day fuelled fears that the phenomenon was spreading. In Lafayette, Louisiana, 42-year-old Carl Jacquneaux is alleged to have torn off part of his neighbour's cheek - and is believed to have taken bath salts or a similar drug. Todd Credeur, 48, is married to Jacquneaux's ex-wife and said he only managed to escape by spraying wasp poison in the man's face. Beat her toddler: Pamela McCarthy, who died after police Tasered her as she went on a naked rampage . Meanwhile, again in Miami, homeless . Brandon de Leon threatened to eat a police officer after he was arrested . during a fight at a restaurant. The 21-year-old gnashed his teeth, . growled and tried to bite the man, who was tending to his self-inflicted . wounds after he smashed his own head against the inside of a patrol car . and then on the walls of a cell. And on June 12, a 35-year-old mother punched and choked her young son while under the influence of bath salts. After beating the three-year-old, Pamela McCarthy was pictured rampaging naked through the streets of Munnsville, New York, as she attacked her neighbours and strangled one of her dogs. She later died of a heart attack after police subdued her with a Taser. The drug has been described as a synthetic alternative to cocaine and methamphetamine and is sold under a variety of names including Cloud 9, Tranquility and Ivory Wave. One drug addict who shared his experience of taking bath salts said its effects 'felt like the darkest, evilest thing imaginable'. A YouTube clip shows a delirious Freddy Sharp, 27, being restrained by paramedics after an overdose led him to believe he was possessed by Jason Vorhees, the psychopathic killer from the Friday the 13th horror films. Authorities have found many American users order their bath salts from web-based companies operating from the UK, the Sun on Sunday reports. As part of an investigation by news . network NBC, a 16-year-old girl was able to order a shipment from an . English supplier. Though the firm claimed it would not sell to . under-18s, the delivery soon showed up at the station's studios. Police . say they cannot stop such sales as the substance is not illegal in the . U.S. Crazed: McCarthy charges at her child and his father during her drug-fuelled spree in New York . A simple web search is all it takes to unearth sellers operating out in the open, as they cover themselves with the flimsiest of disclaimers. Websites label the powders 'research chemicals' or mark them 'not for human consumption', making little reference to the drug's possible effects. Users have been known to enter a state of manic delirium, and some feel so hot they often strip off. Those who become aggressive can be extremely difficult to control, with police struggling to restrain them. Just this weekend a 20-year-old man allegedly hit a 77-year-old woman over the head with a shovel after she asked him to stop swinging it at birds. Robert William White, who had to be shot with a Taser and a rubber bullet after taking bath salts, told police in Glendale, California, that he was an alien and could talk to Jesus. Out in the open: Bath salts such as these, branded as Cloud 9, are easily available on the internet . Bath salts usually contain a combination of chemicals including methylone, MDPV and mephedrone - which caused panic in 2009 after sales of the drug rapidly spread under the names MCAT and meow meow. U.S. authorities have imposed a 12-month emergency ban on the three components, and in Britain MDPV is illegal. But drug enforcers on both sides of the Atlantic have had to play catch-up with the dealers as they exploit loopholes by making subtle changes to the chemical makeup. The wave of frenzied attacks linked to bath salts has been so inhumanly violent that many suspected it was the sort of zombie epidemic imprinted on the public imagination by the likes of TV series The Walking Dead and the films of George Romero. The Center for Disease Control even felt it necessary to address these fears, saying: 'CDC does not know of a virus or condition that would reanimate the dead (or one that would present zombie-like symptoms)'.

Missing: She borrowed the $36 worth of library merchandise from the Portales Public Library in New Mexico, pictured; but never received the court summons . Police had arrived at Mrs Teel’s home after receiving a call that her husband, Jimmy Teel, had assaulted someone, according to the Albuquerque Journal. It was while they were at the couple’s house that Portales police realised there was a warrant out for Mrs Teel’s arrest for the missing young adult fiction and movie. Her attorney, Eric Dixon, says arrest warrants were mailed last year to an address at which Mrs Teel hadn't lived since childhood. However, the mother of five was arrested all the same in front of her children, aged one through ten, and spent the night in the Roosevelt County Detention Centre. She said: ‘My kids are still very emotional. They had to stay with a complete stranger.’ She was released the next day on a $610 bond. The mother did not immediately return a call placed by MailOnline seeking comment. The end of all things: The Twilight Saga will end this summer with the much-anticipated Breaking Dawn Part 2 . The Twilight Saga: New Moon DVD and Stephanie Meyer’s novel Twilight both had a due date of October 5, 2010, but Mrs Teel said she couldn’t remember checking them out. However, library records show that both items were checked out in her name. A judge had placed a warrant for her arrest after she failed to show up in court, but records show that the court summons were sent to her childhood address. Now the mother is suing the city, according to UPI. Mr Dixon wrote in the tort claim: ‘Ms Teel and her small children have been traumatised, humiliated, embarrassed, subject to ridicule, and otherwise suffered pain and suffering and other damages as a result of this wrongful arrest.’ The Albuquerque Journal reported that charges against Mrs Teel were dropped earlier this week.","Lori Teel had borrowed a Twilight book and DVD in October 2010 and forgot to return them .

For best friends Chloe Webb and Lauren Huggett, the answer was to take a £500 helicopter ride instead. Looking more like celebrities than schoolgirls, the 16-year-olds upped the glamour stakes by flying to their end-of-year party just eight miles from where they live. In a scene more akin to the US high school prom-craze, the two girls touched down outside the venue and stepped out in their ballgowns wowing their shocked school friends. The pair had hoped to get a limo for their trip to the prom at the Whitminster Inn, Gloucestershire and were disappointed to discover they were all fully booked. Best friends Chloe Webb and Lauren Huggett, pictured, certainly arrived in style at their prom party . But they certainly weren’t disappointed for long. Lauren’s dad Jason Huggett stepped in to help, and arranged for the girls to be glamorously dropped off to the prom by helicopter instead - and also went along for the ride. The girls were picked up in the Robinson R44 twin-engine chopper at Cashes Green playing field in Stroud and treated to a half-hour ride before surprising their friends when the chopper made its landing at the venue. Chloe said: 'It was a fantastic trip - really good fun. We got in the helicopter and flew around for half-an-hour before being dropped off at our prom. 'All our friends were really shocked - they could not believe it. Chloe Webb, left, and Lauren Huggett, right, take off for the flight of their life with pilot Andy Moorhouse . It was a very glamorous entrance for the girls, more akin to the US-style prom craze . Dressed in their ballgowns, the girls shocked their friends when they made their arrival at the venue in a helicopter . 'We landed on a patch of grass right next to the tent where our prom was taking place in. 'We had wanted to get a limousine to the venue but they had all gone by the time we went to book it - but this was even better. 'The prom was brilliant too.' For Chloe the prom marked the end of her time at Archway School in Stroud. She now plans to study beauty therapy at South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, while Lauren, from Cashes Green will stay on to study in Archway’s sixth-form department. The girls may have been inspired from the blinging ways of across the pond, where extravagant high school proms are treated as a rite of passage. The girls, who were also joined by Lauren's dad, Jason Huggett, enjoyed a 30 minute ride before being dropped off . Thanks to shows such as My Super Sweet 16 and films like High School Musical, the US-style proms have been increasingly on the rise in Britain. Parents are being persuaded to spend hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds on dresses, hair, spray tans, tiaras and limos as US-style proms take hold in Britain. Last week Amy Powell, aged 16, from Billericay, Essex, confessed that her parents Dee, 51, and Phil, 52, spent a staggering £799 on styling their daughter head-to-toe and waving her off in a limo. She said: ‘Of course on the day, people will be judging everyone else’s look. With that many girls, and that many spray tans and big hair, there will be bitchiness. ‘Even now, everyone is keeping their dress secret as they’re so paranoid that someone will copy them — and they want to keep it as a surprise for their big entrance.’",Eight-mile journey cost Chloe Webb and Lauren Huggett £500 .

A jury acquitted a man Thursday of assaulting a priest he says molested him more than three decades ago during a camping trip and left him with tormented memories that led to alcohol abuse, depression and suicide attempts. The verdict came after defendant William Lynch took the witness stand during the two-week trial and acknowledged punching Jerold Lindner several times on May 10, 2010. While previously pleading not guilty, Lynch said he hoped to use the case to publicly shame Lindner and bring further attention to the Catholic Church clergy abuse scandal.

Celebration: William Lynch, right, hugs his father, John Lynch, as his mother, Peggy Lynch, left, watches shortly after William Lynch was found not guilty of two felonies in the beating of Rev Jerold Lindner . 'I honestly thought I was going to jail,' Lynch said. 'It turned out better than I expected.' Steven Clark, a former prosecutor who watched most of the trial, called the verdict a rarity given that Lynch admitted the beating on the witness stand. 'The DA's office was in a very difficult position because they had to go forward with the case,' Clark said. 'They can't allow vigilante justice to be ignored. But the DA's office is not used to having pedophiles as victims.' District Attorney Jeffrey Rosen said authorities understood the abuse and trauma suffered by Lynch. 'And while we understand Mr. Lynch's desire for revenge, we don't condone it,' Rosen said. Lynch, 44, has said memories of the priest have tormented him for years, and he struggled through nightmares, divorce and other problems. He tried to commit suicide twice. Prosecutors called Lynch a vigilante and implored the jury not to be swayed by his dramatic testimony describing the horrific ordeal he claims to have endured at the hands of Lindner.

Lynch countered in his testimony that . he only wanted the priest to sign a confession and started punching . Lindner after the retired priest 'leered' at him the same way he looked . at Lynch in 1975 during the alleged molestation during a camping trip. Priest abuse victims and their supporters contributed to Lynch's defence fund and packed the courtroom every day for a trial. Many carried picket signs outside the courthouse decrying the church abuse scandal. Satisfied: Lynch is pictured grinning in his mugshot after the alleged attack on Lindner in 2010 . Lynch refused to discuss a plea . bargain with prosecutors, even when he was promised he could avoid . prison and would serve no more than a year in exchange for a guilty . plea. Prosecutors said they were left with . little choice but to take the case to trial and ask the jury to find . Lynch guilty of felony assault and felony elder abuse. Lindner was 65 at . the time of the beating. Santa Clara County prosecutor Vicki . Gemetti repeatedly told the jury of nine men and three women that she . sympathized with Lynch and even conceded Lynch was molested. But Gemetti insisted that even the . most unsavoury of victims - drug dealers, wife beaters and child . molesters - deserved equal protection under the law. Lindner also testified and denied . abusing Lynch. He later invoked his Fifth Amendment right against . self-incrimination and would not testify further for fear of a perjury . prosecution. The judge ordered Lindner's testimony stricken from the . record. In a deposition in the late 1990s, .

However, when the skies cleared on Wednesday morning, dozens of parents in the 3,000-person town voiced their anger at the decision and the City took back its decree. Halloween celebrations are back on in a Vermont town which was threatened by Hurricane Sandy following a flurry of complaints from parents (file pic) On Monday, the Chester Police, Fire and Recreation Departments released a joint statement through the Chester Telegraph that all little ghouls and guys would have to wait a week for their annual candy feast. 'These actions are due to hurricane Sandy and the potential deadly weather that is soon to reach us with High Winds, Rain, and Flooding,' the joint statement read. 'Although we anticipate that the worst of the storm may leave us sometime Wednesday morning this storm has been very unpredictable and the after affects and cleanup will last past Wednesday Halloween with Highway and Fire crews taking care of downed trees and power lines. They informed residents that the tradition would continue on November 7, when the public resources had the chance to recover. 'Sandy is the Grinch who stole Halloween,' Carrie Roy King wrote on the wall of the Chester Telegraph in response to the news. She was not alone. Residents were also instructed to take . down or secure any Halloween decorations that might be damaged or cause . damage during the storm.

Police decided to postpone Halloween for a week, saying that . falling debris and other issues due to Hurricane Sandy would make it . unsafe to send children door to door in Chester . The city government was hit with a barrage of angry parents demanding that Halloween be reinstated. The city acquiesced. 'The Chester Services is announcing per a HIGH VOLUME of residents request that Halloween will take place tomorrow evening October 31, 2012 and the postponement date of November 7th is now canceled,' a statement from Deputy Fire Chief Matthew Wilson said. ' We do feel there may still be some inclement weather so please use caution for current weather.' He apologized for any confusion about the festivities, adding that ' severe weather it is very hard to predict and the safety of the children and residents needs to come first.' Several towns on the East Coast chose to beat the storm and celebrate early, like Vineland, N.J., and Kittery, Maine, according to USA Today. Last year's Tropical Storm Irene taught them a soggy lesson in preparedness. 'Every child in the city and their families want to enjoy a safe Halloween tradition without the concern, confusion or fear that a favorite holiday will be jeopardized by the storm, so we are urging neighbors to have children celebrate early in good weather, without concern for public safety issues that might arise as a result of the storm,' Gloucester, Massachusetts, Mayor Carolyn Kirk said in a written statement. Children dressed in costumes take part in the annual Jackson Heights Halloween Parade in New York in 2009 - The festival has been cancelled for the first time in history . Dover, New Hampshire, and Oxford, New Jersey have opted to move the party until next week. Confusion over Halloween parties and parades has struck the entire Eastern Seaboard. New York City's Halloween parade was cancelled for the first time in history. Organizers of the parade said: 'We hope that everyone who would have come to the Parade is safe and that those who can volunteer to help out at one of the  Emergency Outreach Centers near you. We will surely miss all of you!' New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced today that trick-or-treating in The Garden State would be postponed until Monday, November 5 after the trail of destruction left by Sandy made it dangerous for many residents to venture out into the streets. He promised: 'If conditions are not safe on Wednesday for trick-or-treating, I will sign an executive order rescheduling.' The New York City parade, which would have begun at 6.30pm on 6th Avenue, usually attracts up to 60,000 Halloween lovers in the most outrageous costumes.

Four of Lance Armstrong's former teammates are set to testify against the superstar cyclist in an ongoing doping investigation, according to stories in The New York Times and three European newspapers. The reports claim George Hincapie, who was by Armstrong's side for all of his seven Tour de France victories, as well as Levi Leipheimer, Christian Vande Velde and David Zabriskie are collaborating in the probe launched by the United States Anti-Doping Agency. But the riders will remain in the Tour de France and the USADA and teams involved have denied reports that they will face a six-month suspension from September. Probe: Four former teammates have been named as potential witnesses against Lance Armstrong, pictured, who is facing doping charges . The news stories - in De Telegraaf in Amsterdam, El País in Madrid and La Gazzetta dello Sport in Milan on Thursday - marked the first time names have been publicly linked to an alleged list of 10 witnesses that the agency said it has to support claims that Armstrong was the centre of a doping conspiracy from 1999 to 2011, according to Velo News. Armstrong retired from cycling last year and denies ever doping. He has until Monday to decide whether he will challenge or accept the charges against him, which carry a lifetime ban from Olympic sports, his spokesman, Mark Fabiani, told the New York Times. He can, however, extend this by five days. Testify: BMC Racing Team rider George Hincapie, left, Omega Pharma-Quickstep rider Levi Leipheimer, right, have reportedly agreed to testify against Armstrong in the doping case . Teammates: Garmin-Sharp riders David Zabriskie, left, Christian Vande Velde, right, have also agreed to testify against the Tour de France legend according to reports . If he contests the charges, the case will go to an arbitration hearing but if he loses, Armstrong would be stripped of his record seven yellow jerseys. Velo News reported a UCI - International Cycling Union - official as saying that the doping agency hadn't shared any information with it concerning the Armstrong investigation so it was therefore impossible for it to consider suspending any riders or staff. Armstrong’s former team manager, Johan Bruyneel, his former trainer, Michele Ferrari, two team doctors and a team trainer are also charged. Doping: Armstrong, pictured, denies ever doping and claims the anti-doping agency has a 'vendetta' against him . According to the Times, Hincapie, Leipheimer, Vande Velde and Zabriskie, who all were on the 2008 Olympic cycling team, pulled their names in June from the pool of riders vying to make America's team for the London Games because of their involvement in the probe. USADA chief executive Travis Tygart would not comment to the Times on who would be stepping up to the witness stand. He said in a statement that any potential witnesses could face 'unnecessary scrutiny, threats and intimidation.' Write caption here . 'It is important to remember that the truth would often be suppressed without witnesses who at great cost to themselves are willing to tell the truth under oath about what they saw and experienced, and any attempt to circumvent the proper procedures in order to bully or silence people who may or may not be witnesses cannot be tolerated,' he said. Tygart added that no cyclist had yet . been punished in connection with the Armstrong case. He was denying a report in . De Telegraaf that the four men and . Jonathan Vaughters, a former Armstrong teammate who now runs the . Garmin-Sharp team, brokered a deal with the anti-doping agency to serve . six-month suspensions for their own doping in connection with a . suspected conspiracy. Competition: Cyclists compete in stage five of the Tour de France from Rouen to Saint-Quentin, France . Vaughters told reporters that the story was 'amateur'. 'That article was essentially irresponsible,' he said, according to Velo News. 'There was not any source. That's not my choice. That's their decision (to publish the names).' Meanwhile, Armstrong let rip on Twitter that some of his former teammates were receiving immunity for feeding the agency information. 'Come in and tell @usantidoping exactly what they wanted to hear in exchange for immunity, anonymity and an opportunity to continue to race the biggest event in cycling,' he said. He also said the 'riders in question' are also 'victims of @usantidoping’s unfair process and antics.'","Newspaper reports claim four former teammates will take the stand against the seven time Tour de France legend .

A teenager who fell to his death from a bridge may have been the victim of bullies, it emerged today. Police believe Lewis Edge, 13, plunged 80 feet into the River Mersey from the Runcorn Bridge in Cheshire. His body was found in the water just 400 yards from his Widnes home, which lies close to the crossing, after being reported missing on Wednesday. As members of his family come to terms with his death, allegations have emerged that he may have been the victim of bullying.

Police and paramedics responded to the alert, but his lifeless body was pulled from the water and he was pronounced dead at the scene. His death is being treated as 'unexplained', but early reports indicate he may have fallen more than 100 yards from a footpath on the Runcorn 'Silver Jubilee Bridge'. The distinctive arch-span bridge links Widnes with Runcorn and the spot where his body was recovered is near the entrance to the Sankey Canal. Forensic teams were continuing their investigation at the scene and the footpath over the bridge was closed to the public.

Investigators who believe a defendant killed himself in a Phoenix courtroom shortly after a jury found him guilty of arson say their theory is backed up by evidence that includes a canister labeled as cyanide found in his vehicle. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Tuesday that the family of Michael Marin, 53, received a delayed email from him the night after his June 28 death in court. The email includes information about his will in case things went poorly, Arpaio said. Scroll down for video . Last resort: After being found guilty of burning down his own home and facing years in jail, Michael Marin appeared to swallow a substance in the Arizona courtroom . Emergency: The 53-year-old was stretchered out of the court in Phoenix minutes later but died in hospital . After being convicted of deliberately burning down his $3.5 million Phoenix mansion, Marin appeared shocked. He closed his . eyes as the verdict was read before appearing to put something in his . mouth and wash it down with liquid in a plastic water bottle. In . the shocking court room video, he then fell to the floor a few minutes . later in convulsions. Mr Marin was taken to a hospital in Phoenix, . Arizona, where he was pronounced dead. When Marin's trial began in May, prosecutors said he could face 16 years in prison if he was convicted. Marin burned down his Phoenix mansion on July 5, 2009 after it failed to sell at a charity auction. The email also led Marin's family to his vehicle, and they contacted the sheriff's office. Investigators found a can labeled 'cyanide' in Marin's vehicle. The canister was turned over to the medical examiner's office unopened. Cari Gerchick, communications director for Maricopa County, said the medical examiner's office could not immediately confirm if the canister indeed contains cyanide. Gerchick said the medical examiner's office is still determining Marin's cause and manner of death. Arpaio said investigators have determined that Marin purchased the canister from a California-based Internet site in 2011 using his personal credit card. Distress: Marin, a father of four and a grandfather, faced up to 16 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of arson . Ashen-faced: Marin, a former Wall Street trader, was found guilty of torching his $3.5million mansion because he could not afford the mortgage . Fire Department investigators . determined the fire was deliberate after finding several points of . origin throughout the sprawling  6,600 sq ft home with four garages. Marin later told authorities that he had escaped after setting the fire by climbing from the second floor using a rope ladder and wearing a scuba-diving suit, according to Fox. No one was injured in the blaze but the . charge of committing arson of an occupied structure holds the same . number of years in prison in Arizona as second-degree murder. Prosecutors claimed Marin set fire to his house in desperation because he could no longer pay the mortgage. Marin, a father of four and grandfather of two, attended Yale Law School. He was an ex-Wall Street trader who enjoyed collecting art including Picasso sketches and described himself as a 'careful thrill seeker' to the Phoenix New Times after scaling Mount Everest and trips into the jungles of south-east Asian.

Ruling: Former Daybreak presenter Angela Corpe has lost her employment tribunal against ITV . A presenter on morning TV show Daybreak who claimed she was bullied by her boss following an ectopic pregnancy has lost her sex discrimination claim. Angela Corpe, 36, alleged she returned . from sick leave last August to be told by Daybreak boss Ian Rumsey, who . was once married to the show's main presenter Kate Garraway, that she had . been overlooked for the job of pool producer on the show. She claimed Mr Rumsey began a . meeting between the two of them by saying 'I hope you don’t think your . ectopic pregnancy had anything to do with not getting the job' before . behaving in a 'belligerent, rude and aggressive' manner. Daybreak admitted they had treated her unfairly by not advertising the role and choosing a candidate who had recently applied for another producer job. However, Miss Corpe lost her claim for sexual discrimination after an employment tribunal ruled that although the recruitment process was unfair, it did not have anything to with her gender or pregnancy. Giving evidence earlier in the hearing  Mr Rumsey, who no longer works on the breakfast show, said the post had to be filled quickly as that was the nature of TV and he did not think Miss Corpe was interested in the role as her main ambition was to be a reporter. He claimed he was ‘hurt, shocked and appalled’ by the allegations against him and said he had always been ‘completely supportive’ of Miss Corpe and was saddened when he heard about her loss. Miss Corpe had argued that she had been convinced she would be offered the job of pool producer, after . covering it during someone else's maternity leave. She told the hearing Mr Rumsey had praised her work in the past and told her she was 'very good' at her job. But after returning to work . after taking time off to recover from her miscarriage, Ms Corpe was told . that to be eligible for the job, she must have . already applied for a day producer job, which involved 23 hour shifts . and sleeping in the studio one night a week. She added it was a 'ridiculous suggestion' that she should apply for a . job she did not want in the hope in of being offeredone that she . did want. She told the tribunal in Croydon that at their meeting Mr Rumsey steadfastly . refused to re-advertise the position and told her he had assumed she did . not want it since she did not apply for the Daytime producer role. She said: 'He kept telling me what’s done is done and they would not re-advertise the role or consider other candidates.' She said: 'I believe his exclusion of me was deliberate and the . exclusion of others who may or may not have applied was a by-product. Accusations: Ms Corpe's former boss, Ian Rumsey, who was accused of . threatening and bullying behaviour, is the former husband of Kate . Garraway . Allegation: Ms Corpe claimed she was passed over for a promotion after taking time off work because of an ectopic pregnancy . 'I believe it was on the basis of my ectopic pregnancy because I . cannot think of anything else he would be able to complain about.' After the fiery September meeting Ms Corpe said she had cried in the toilet before facing her colleagues in the newsroom. Mr Rumsey himself has since left ITV . after network bosses accepted his resignation given the failure of . Daybreak to attract an audience. He told the tribunal: 'As a husband and father, my wife and . I have been through various good and bad experiences in pregnancy. 'My first and only reaction was of sadness for Angela and full support for her. 'In all similar matters I’ve acted in a way I would expect any manager to treat my wife. 'In . every circumstance where female workers have told me they are pregnant I . have always been happy for them and told them of my own experiences. 'They . should take great care to look after themselves, with work being far . less important that their health and the health of their child. 'Angela . seemed to appreciate the support I had given her and she certainly did . not raise any complaint with me at that time that I was not being . supportive.' He married Ms Garraway 1998. They divorced in April 2002. On camera: Ms Corpe was convinced she would be offered a producer role after impressing bosses, and believes she was overlooked because of her miscarriage . Still employed by ITV: Ms Corpe has taken on a presenter/producer role elsewhere at the network . Nick . Goodfellow, representing ITV, said Ms Corpe had completely . misrepresented the meeting with Mr Rumsey and she entered the meeting in . an 'agitated state'. Under cross-examination he read from emails where Mr Rumsey was 'sympathetic and kind' on learning about her miscarriage. Delivering the panels judgment, . employment judge Christopher Baron said they accepted Mr Rumsey’s . evidence was a ‘reasonable explanation’ for what he did. Mr Baron added: 'He was misguided, that is accepted. It is not in . dispute that what occurred was far from being best practise in . accordance with the European and Human Rights Commission code or the . company’s equal opportunities policy. 'However, what occurred had nothing to do with the claimant’s pregnancy or her gender. 'It may have been unfair, it may have been unreasonable, but we find it . was not in breach of the Equalities Act. Therefore the claim fails.' Miss Corpe, a former Sky News . reporter, has since accepted a £37,000 a year role with ITV as a . reporter/producer after being offered the job following the grievance . process. She looked upset and declined to comment after hearing the judgment. Representatives for Daybreak also refused to comment on the outcome.","Angela Corpe, 36, claims she was turned down for promotion because of miscarriage .

"By . Chris Brooke and Anthony Bond . UPDATED: . 02:57 EST, 12 July 2012 . Guilty: Hannah Bonser, pictured when she appeared at before magistrates earlier . this year, killed Casey Kearney, 13, at a park in Doncaster . An investigation is underway into why a woman with mental health problems who begged to be admitted to a hospital was turned away before going on to kill a schoolgirl. Hannah Bonser was jailed for at least 22 years yesterday after stabbing Casey Kearney, 13, to death. The 26-year-old had suffered years of mental problems caused by cannabis use and claimed she heard voices in her head telling her to kill. A month before the murder, Bonser begged staff at Doncaster Royal Infirmary to admit her. She described herself to hospital staff as ‘a complete psychopath’. However, she was turned away from the hospital. According to the Daily Telegraph, it emerged yesterday that an investigation immediately began following the murder looking at Bonser's previous contact  with mental health agencies . The investigation will consider whether anymore could have been done to help Bonser. In the months before the random murder of Miss Kearney in a park, Bonser had been warned by police for carrying a knife in public. The defence had urged the jury to find her guilty of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. But she was jailed for life after the jury decided she couldn’t use her mental illness as an excuse for the attack on a complete stranger. Casey was walking through a park in Doncaster at lunchtime on Valentine’s Day when Bonser plunged a knife into her chest. As the killer strolled off to hand herself in to a mental health charity, Casey rang 999 and told the operator: ‘I’ve been stabbed, I’ve just been stabbed,’ before collapsing. She died later that evening in hospital. The teenager, described as ‘mature and responsible’, had taken the bus from her home and was walking to a friend’s house for a sleepover when she was attacked. Scroll down for video .

Attack: Casey, pictured at a family event holding a baby, managed to call police after she was stabbed . Jailing Bonser at Sheffield Crown . Court, Mr Justice Cranston said: ‘Why had Hannah Bonser done this to . Casey, a young girl and a completely and wholly innocent stranger? We . don’t know.’ There was evidence Bonser practised . the knife attack on the door of her council flat and she bought two . large kitchen knives hours before the killing. Graham Reeds, prosecuting, agreed that . Bonser had a ‘personality disorder’ but said she was not a dangerous . schizophrenic who had been misdiagnosed. The jury convicted her after deliberating for just over two hours. Outside court, Casey’s father Anthony Kearney said: ‘There was never a doubt in our minds this was a calculated and deliberate act and therefore deserves the maximum sentence our judicial system allows. ‘However, no sentence will bring Casey . back to us and the severity of Bonser’s actions means we will never . have the privilege of her in our lives again.’ The jury heard Bonser may have exaggerated her mental health problems to get moved out of her council flat. Psychiatrist Dr Nigel Eastman said she . was a ‘malingerer’ who was ‘playing games’ and making things up to . manipulate the system. Yet no one disputed she had serious mental health . problems. Bonser was described by her brother . Ben, 29, as ‘like the girl in The Exorcist’ who was possessed by demons. ‘She was scary, she wanted to tear apart those around her,’ he said. In . 2002, Bonser walked into a hospital on her 17th birthday complaining of . hearing voices telling her ‘to kill people’. She was admitted to . hospital and given anti-psychotic drugs. Later that year she twice . overdosed. The judge confirmed Bonser had a . ‘mental and behaviour disorder due to abuse of cannabis’. She was in . regular contact with psychiatric services between 2004 and 2007 and . given drugs to control her delusions. Last September, Bonser was warned by a . policeman for carrying a knife. She was still hooked on cannabis and . regarded as a ‘strange loner’ by neighbours. In November she was admitted to . hospital after attempting suicide and in January her requests to be . sectioned were rejected as ‘nothing was wrong with her’. A month before the killing, she told . staff at the mental health charity Rethink that she needed to be . isolated because she was a ‘complete psychopath’. Bonser continued to act oddly and on . February 11 told a friend ‘she was going to get revenge on anybody who . had upset her in her life’. She said she was ‘evil’ and needed to be . sectioned. Three days later Casey was killed. An inquiry led by Professor Pat . Cantrill will analyse the actions of social workers, the psychiatric . services, charity workers and police in the case.

Pioneer: Female baseball star Doris Sams was a five-time All Star player during her eight-year career . Doris Sams, the pioneering women's baseball star who inspired a hit Hollywood film, has died aged 85. Sams, a leading player in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and 50s, passed away on Thursday following a three-year battle with Alzheimers. The women's baseball pioneer, a five-time All Star in her eight-year professional career, also inspired the 1992 Tom Hanks film A League of Their Own. Sams, also called Sammye, played for the Muskegon Lassies, and later the Kalamazoo Lassies. She made the circuit's honor team in 1947 and from 1949 through 1952. She averaged more than .300 during each of her last four seasons. One sportswriter called her 'calm and cool at all times.' 'Sammye is the tempering force of the team,' Muskegon Chronicle sportswriter James F. Henderson wrote at the time. 'Where another might become ruffled, she maintains a placid demeanor.' Sams played for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the brainchild of Major League team owners Philip Wrigley and Branch Rickey as a wartime diversion, and they paid some 600 women players between $45 and $75 a game, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Their salary was several times what the mostly working-class players could make in jobs traditionally reserved for women, author Barbara Gregorich wrote in her book, 'Women at Play.' Wrigley reasoned that, if women could be used to build ships and aircraft, they could also be used to fill the nation's ballparks while male players were at war, Sharon Roepke wrote in her book 'Diamond Gals.' 'The women ballplayers would serve as inspirational examples to further the 'manpower' mobilization,' Roepke wrote. Respected: Sams was known by sportswriters for being 'cool and calm at all times' 'In addition to playing ball they would raise money for war bonds, develop youth programs and visit service hospitals.' The 1992 movie 'A League of Their Own' featured actor Tom Hanks as the heavy-drinking team manager depressed about coaching women. After making one player cry, he memorably said, 'There's no crying in baseball.' The women's league's teams were coached by men. Hanks' players included the fiercely competitive Dottie Hinson (played by Geena Davis) and the rebellious, gum-chewing Mae Mordabito (Madonna). Though the film is widely thought to have been directly inspired by the career of wartime baseball star Dottie Collins, players like Doris Sams who blazed a trail as the first superstar female baseball players in the 1940s were also said to be inspiration for the film, which was nominated for two Golden Globes. The Stevens Mortuary Chapel in Knoxville said Sams died Thursday and her funeral service was Sunday. Despite all her honors, Sams remained humble. In a 1997 interview, she said her perfect game 'wasn't so perfect.' 'They hit me like a drum,' she said. 'But it was one of those days when everybody was on their toes. They were catching line drives. You know, the pitcher doesn't do it alone, let's face it. 'They caught line drives and everything else — just unreasonable catches that day.' Friends also recalled a somewhat shy Sams. Legacy: Sams was one of the players who inspired the 1992 film A League of Their Own, starring Tom Hanks and Geena Davis (pictured), though none of the characters were based on her directly. Frances Rader, who had known Sams since childhood, told The Knoxville News Sentinel that when producers of the 1992 movie 'A League of Their Own' wanted Sams to help promote it, she declined because she didn't want to be in the spotlight. Sams' 88-year-old cousin says her legacy will continue to shine. 'She made women more a part of public sports,' Gordon Sams told the newspaper. 'She was an interesting lady and I hope she will never be forgotten.'","Female baseball icon was one of several star players in 1940s and 50s who inspired 1992 film A League of Their Own .

A schoolgirl was left with a badly swollen face after suffering a terrifying allergic reaction to her sunglasses on holiday. Laura Musson’s head, eyes and nose ballooned in size, leaving her features so distorted that even her parents didn’t recognise her. Doctors said she - and her friend, who was also wearing a pair of similar glasses - had both suffered severe allergic reactions and confirmed plastic in the sunglasses was the most likely cause. Before and after: The teenager, pictured left, enjoying her holiday in Majorca, unaware of the damage to her face caused by the sunglasses, right . After seeking urgent medical treatment in Spain, the distraught teenager's parents booked their daughter on the next flight back to the UK for further hospital treatment. Now she wants to warn other holidaymakers about the perils of buying and wearing cheap sunglasses. Laura, from Bottesford, . Nottinghamshire said: ‘It was supposed to be a holiday to celebrate . finishing our A Levels. It was the first time we’d ever been abroad . without our parents but it was totally ruined by a pair of £1 . sunglasses. ‘It was . terrifying. I honestly thought I would die. I was sick and dizzy and . everyone was staring at me because I looked like I’d been badly beaten . up. Laura suffered the extreme reaction to the pair of sunglasses whilst celebrating the end of her exams in Majorca with her sister and friend . ‘I didn’t understand what was happening to me in the hospital so I begged mum and dad to get us home. ‘I was worried I would never look normal again.’ The drama started when Laura, her twin sister Lucy, and a college pal flew to Majorca on June 28th this year. Laura Musson, who said she ended up looking like a character from Avatar, pictured after the swelling had gone down . After a day by the pool wearing her new shades, which she had purchased from a High Street shop, Laura felt her forehead was starting to burn. ‘I thought it was the heat so put more sun cream on even though I had been wearing factor 30 already,’ she explains. It was the next day that horrified Laura noticed her head and eyes were starting to swell. ‘I didn’t know what was happening. I’ve been to sunny places before so I knew it wasn’t the heat. 'I looked (like) a freak. My friend’s head was swelling too.’ But not realising the glasses were to blame, Laura and her friend kept wearing them because they were so ashamed of the way they looked. When that night her friend complained her throat was swelling, panicking Laura called an ambulance. ‘They gave her an injection which helped her swelling go down, but refused to treat me because I wasn’t the patient,’ said Laura. But by next morning, with her face now twice it’s usual size, Laura found a local doctor to inject her with an anti-inflammatory for 50 Euros. ‘He said it would go down but back at the hotel it was getting worse and worse. I sent mum and dad a picture and they didn’t recognise me.’ Soon it was so bad Laura could barely see out of her eyes. It was then she started to suspect the sunglasses were to blame. ‘My twin was OK and she was the only one without the glasses. I knew it had to be them. ‘I looked like a different person, like I had been badly beaten up. 'I knew I had to get to hospital and was starting to seriously panic about what was happening to me. Plastic sunglasses, such as those worn by Laura, contain dyes and waxes which may cause allergic reactions in some. A combination of materials, such as zyl or propionate, as well as nylon and polyamides can, in rare cases, also lead to irritation of the skin. Allergic reactions to plastic sunglasses remain rare, however, but medical experts have warned of other dangers in wearing cheap shades. The sunglasses do not always offer adequate protection from harmful UV rays and wearers may be putting their sight at risk. Too much exposure to such rays can damage the retina and lens of the eye - causing irreversible damage. ‘They told us to keep putting cold water on the swellings but when it became clear nothing was working I was desperate to get home. 'I didn’t want to die in Spain over a pair of sunglasses. ‘I called my parents in tears and they booked us all on the next flight.’ They were waiting at East Midlands airport to meet them off the plane and rush Laura straight to hospital. Mother Sonya broke down when she saw her girl. ‘My mum couldn’t believe it was me. 'I looked like one of those Avatars from the film. She was crying and I was crying.’ They drove straight to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. Doctors confirmed she had suffered a severe allergic reaction to the sunglasses and prescribed a course of antihistamines. The swelling is now starting to go down. But Laura said she has been left devastated after her holiday insurance did not cover her £470 holiday or the early flight home. ‘They ruined my holiday and looks - I thought I was getting a bargain for £1 but they cost me a fortune. As a student I can’t afford another holiday. ‘Don’t buy them, it’s not worth it.’","Laura Musson, 17, who was holidaying away from her parents for the first time, said her head ballooned in size after wearing the sunglasses purchased from a major High Street retailer .

"By . Louise Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 17:41 EST, 12 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:47 EST, 12 July 2012 . An ongoing criminal case against a former top aide to Florida Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll is developing into a swirl of allegations about improper relationships and widespread illegal taping of phone calls inside Carroll's office. The allegations, which Carroll denies, were included in a court filing made late last week by the attorney representing Carletha Cole who was fired from her job. Cole, 48, was arrested last October on charges that she gave an illegally taped conversation with another aide to a newspaper reporter. Sex scandal: Florida governor Rick Scott and his deputy Jennifer Carroll have been mired in allegations from a former aide about affairs and phone tapping . Cole's attorneys made the filing in response to prosecutors' attempts to seal some evidence in the case. In the most sensational claim, Cole said she witnessed Carroll and a top aide, Beatriz Ramos, in a 'compromising position' inside Carroll's office. She also claimed that Carroll's chief of staff secretly recorded conversations routinely at the direction of those working for Gov. Rick Scott, and that the trash can at Cole's desk might have been deliberately set ablaze following an argument between her and Ramos. Cole also said Ramos was living at Carroll's home and at one point she was ordered by Ramos to find adjoining hotel rooms for the pair when they traveled. The disgruntle aide said that she was 'scolded' by Carroll's security team when she placed Ramos next door to Carroll when the lieutenant governor and her husband traveled to Puerto Rico last summer. Sensational: Carletha Cole, 48, was fired from her job and is on trial for giving an illegally taped phone conversation to a newspaper . The agent told her to not do it again, Cole said, but did not explain why. Lieutenant-Governor Carroll, a former Navy officer who is also a mother-of-three, said the allegations are all lies. 'That's . totally false and absurd,' said Carroll, a former Republican legislator . who was chosen by Scott as his running mate in 2010. Carroll . said the allegations are an attempt by Cole and her attorney to get the . criminal charges against Cole dropped. The former aide was charged with . a third-degree felony and could serve up to five years in prison. Carroll said: 'They are trying to pull at straws. All this stuff you mentioned doesn't excuse what happened.' Ramos, whose title is special assistant to the lieutenant governor, did not return a phone call to her office. Stephen Webster, the Tallahassee . attorney representing 48-year-old Cole, stood by the allegations . included in the filing. He said: 'That's the truth. It is what it is.' Webster said his client is a grandmother and minister who had never been in previous legal trouble. He said the filing was made to show . that Carroll, Ramos and Carroll's chief-of-staff, John Konkus, have . reasons to make Cole look bad because they could be witnesses at Cole's . trial. Mr Webster added: 'It's a desperate prosecution that is politically motivated.' The attorney works for the law firm of Steven Andrews, who has clashed with Governor Scott in the past. He filed a lawsuit during the 2010 . campaign attempting to obtain a video deposition Scott had given in a . case against a chain of health clinics he helped start. Political power: Lt. Governor Jennifer Carroll (with Governor Scott) allegedly had a relationship with a female aide . The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) investigation that resulted in Cole's arrest began last September after the agency received a complaint that a secret audio recording had been made in Carroll's office. The agency reported its findings to prosecutor Willie Meggs, the state attorney for the Tallahassee area. It is against Florida law to record someone without consent, but there have been legal questions about recordings made in public buildings. The Florida Times-Union newspaper obtained a copy of the conversation between Konkus, Carroll's chief-of-staff, and Cole, a senior program analyst who also acted as a spokeswoman for Carroll. The Times-Union placed the recording on its website. Konkus can be heard saying that the governor's then- chief of staff, Steve MacNamara, is afraid of Lieutenant-Governor Carroll. Konkus also complained that Scott 'is not leading'. The woman is facing a third-degree felony charge. Her allegations should be considered in that light. Spokesman for Governor Scott . Later in her court filing, Cole stated that she went to Carroll's office door, which was closed. She said she walked in and found Carroll and Ramos 'in what can only be described as a compromising position'. Carroll denied this ever happened. Cole was fired about the time the investigation began after publicly speaking out about infighting in Carroll's office. A sworn statement by an FDLE agent said that investigators looked into Cole's emails and cellphone records and discovered that she had sent the recording to the Times-Union reporter. Konkus, who said the recording was made without his permission, told investigators it was made sometime between June and August 2011. He said he was working with Cole on Carroll's website. But Cole's attorney maintained in his filing with the court that recording went on all the time in the lieutenant governor's office and that Scott's communications teams instructed staff members to 'covertly' record conversations in the office, especially with members of the press for accuracy. They also maintain that Konkus joked about having a 'smart pen' that could record conversations without anyone knowing about it. When reached by email, Konkus said he could not comment on the case and directed questions to Scott's press office. Brian Burgess, a spokesman for Governor Scott, called the allegations about widespread taping and the rest of Cole's assertions 'outrageous'. 'The woman is facing a third-degree felony charge,' Burgess said. 'Her allegations should be considered in that light.' Attorney Stephen Webster made the court filing after Meggs' office filed a motion to keep confidential two documents that the defense wanted to use -  a one-page report summarizing a polygraph test given to Cole where she talked about Carroll and Ramos and an FDLE report regarding the trash can fire in Carroll's office. The prosecutor on the case would not comment about the motion. The official filing stated that the documents should be kept confidential in order to protect a 'compelling government interest' and to avoid harming third parties. The state's motion also contended the documents were irrelevant but could pose a threat to Cole receiving a fair trial because they would generate media interest. A judge held a hearing last Friday where he ruled that the polygraph report would be kept confidential but the FDLE report would remain public.

A further 2,000 troops, including raw Army recruits, could be drafted in to protect Olympic venues if the security shambles gets worse. The Armed Forces were told last week to provide an extra 3,500 personnel for the Games after security group G4S failed to provide enough civilian guards. But military chiefs have begun urgent work on identifying more soldiers who could be deployed in an emergency, and it is understood that a decision on whether to put 2,000 troops on 'notice to move' will be taken tomorrow. Desperate measures: Soldiers patrol the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London. Ministry of Defence officials are making emergency plans to deploy a further 2,000 troops . The security crisis puts an added burden on the military, which already has 48,000 soldiers committed to the Olympics, Afghanistan and other operations across the globe. The plans emerged after G4S chief executive Nick Buckles admitted to MPs that he did not know how many security guards his company would be able to provide when the Games start next week. The firm signed a £284million contract to provide 10,400 guards for the Olympics, but Mr Buckles told the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday that it had a set a revised target of 7,000. Preparations: A soldier attends the Ministry of Defence camp in Hainault Forest Country Park, where soldiers drafted in for the security operation will stay . Defence secretary Philip Hammond, has confirmed that 2,500 of the additional military personnel already committed to the Olympics operation are to be housed in an exhibition centre at Wapping in east London. Tobacco Dock is a grade 1-listed, converted 19th-century warehouse. The remaining 1,000 troops are to be housed in temporary accommodation in Hainault, Essex and on military bases. Ministry of Defence planners contacted units this week to find out whether they could spare any more personnel. The RAF and Royal Navy are understood . to have indicated they have no one available, but the Army and Royal . Marines will have personnel on standby. Personnel . earmarked for the roles include up to 150 recruits from the Infantry . Training Centre in Catterick, North Yorkshire. Instructors could also be . called up. The recruits will have completed only 26 weeks of training. The . majority of the emergency force is expected to come from 7 Armoured . Brigade.

It's the sight every diver fears - a fearsome four-metre long shark eerily drifting into view as the support boat bobs far away on the horizon. But that is what faced divers Dave Richards and Nathan Podmore when they went spearfishing off the western coast of Australia at the weekend. The pair spent a terrifying three minutes trying to fend the shark off with nothing but spear guns and a knife as the animal circled around them. Unnerving: Dave Richards and Nathan Podmore spent three minutes fending off a shark when it approached them in waters off the coast of western Australia . Eventually the shark swam away and the duo were able to make their way back to the safety of their nearby boat. Amazing the dramatic scene was all recorded by a camera attached to Mr Podmore's head. Mr Richards described the frightening attack to Australia's West Australian. He said: 'I was on the top of the water getting ready to go down and I felt something moving behind me. 'I turned around and all I saw was the back section of the shark. Mate, it was a metre away. My heart sank and I just tried to get Nathan's attention.' The divers were ten minutes into the trip when the shocking encounter took place. Deadly: Mr Podmore pokes his spear gun in the direction of the shark as its eye glistens in the water . Squaring up: The shark turns on Mr Podmore an makes a beeline for his speargun . Distant: The pair's boat can be seen in the video 150ft away - too far for the divers to reach . Relief: Nathan Podmore, left, screams with joy after clambering back on to the boat following the encounter, with fellow diver Dave Richards, pictured right . In the video the boat can be seen on the horizon, about 150 feet away and the pair had no choice but to stand their ground. The shark launched the attack close to the surface and the camera shows both men constantly bobbing above and below the water. Incredibly they remained calm throughout the encounter and were able to send the shark on its way by prodding it with their spear guns. As the above video shows, they were understandably overjoyed when they arrived back at their boat unharmed. In an interview with 7News Mr Richards added: 'In the water it just looked massive. 'I think if it wanted to it could have made a meal out of us, really.' On the same day as Mr Podmore and Richards' heart-stopping meeting with the shart, a great white attacked a kayaker off the coast of California.

A tabloids in the country is reporting that the convicted killer of 21-year-old Stephany Flores is planning to marry a mystery woman within the walls of the Lima, Peru prison. The Dutchman’s lawyer, Maximo Altez, denied the tabloid rumours, but added: ‘I’m just in charge of his legal issues, and I don’t participate in his private life.’ Scroll down for video . Tying the knot? Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot, pictured in January, is rumoured to be getting married whilst in prison in Peru . Speaking out: Van der Sloot says in newly-revealed jailhouse letters that he hopes the Flores family can forgive him and blames 'bad legal advice' for his lengthy sentence . Convicted: Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years in prison in the murder of Stephany Flores . Van der Sloot is currently serving a 28-year sentence after pleading guilty to Flores’ 2010 death at the maximum security facility Piedras Gordas in Lima, Peru. The business student was found . strangled in Van der Sloot’s hotel room. The 24-year-old prisoner is . also the primary suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway. She vanished in Aruba while on break with her school friends. Mr Altez told the Daily Beast that the . Peruvian newspaper cited him as their source on the matter, but said: . ‘I deny all of that.’ Van der Sloot is also trying to appeal what he calls a lengthy sentenc . In the letters, believed to have been written last month and released by his lawyer Max Altez, van der Sloot says that he hopes the Flores family can forgive him for his crimes. 'I ask God every day that Stephany's parents can find it in their heart to forgive me,' van der Sloot wrote. But van der Sloot also made an attempt to paint himself as the victim. He . said that he believes he was misled by his attorney when he pleaded . guilty to Flores’ murder and suffers from ‘psychological’ problems that . he believes should have been weighed in the murder case. Van . der Sloot wrote: 'My rights have been constantly abused. My lawyer promised me I would receive 15 years if I plead guilty, I did.' Tale of two women: Stephany Flores, left, was murdered five years after Natalee Holloway, right, went missing in . Aruba. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in the Holloway case, but never . charged . Jailed: Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot now faces extradition to the U.S. for allegedly trying to extort money from Natalee Holloway's mother Beth . He . also referred to himself as a psychological 'mess' in the letters, . which were written in English and contain numerous misspellings and . grammatical errors. 'I have a history of psychological problems which were never taken into consideration,' he said.Van . der Sloot also took the opportunity to address Natalee Holloway, . claiming once again that he had nothing to do with the teen’s 2005 . disappearance in Aruba. He . also faces charges of trying to extort $25,000 from Natalee Holloway’s . mother Beth, promising to reveal the location of the 17-year-old’s body . in exchange for the money. His extradition to the U.S. has been approved in that case, but he must first serve his sentence in Peru for the Flores murder. Taken away: Van der Sloot, centre, is seen escorted by police officers in Lima in this photo from June 2010, after his arrest for the murder of Stephany Flores . Last . month, a Peruvian court ruled that van der Sloot will be extradited to . the U.S. to face trial in an alleged extortion plot against Holloway's . mother Beth. That trial, however, won't happen until he has served his 28-year jail sentence in Peru for the murder of Stephany Flores. The . decision by the Peruvian Supreme Court means that the family of . Holloway, who disappeared in 2005 and has since been declared dead, will . have to wait many more agonising years before they will see van der . Sloot on trial. Natalee Holloway was 17 when she disappeared in Aruba, a Dutch island in the southern Caribbean Sea, during a school trip. Prosecutors said $25,000 was paid to van der Sloot, but nothing was disclosed about Natalee's whereabouts. Altez had recently speculated he thought his client would be extradited within three months, and had believed the U.S. trial would go ahead before the Peruvian murder sentence. Parents: David Holloway, left, is seen . during a hearing in Alabama, while Beth . Holloway, right, is pursued by reporters after a hearing after which . her daughter was officially declared dead . Authorities in the U.S. believe that . the money extorted from Beth Holloway was used by van der Sloot to . travel to Peru on May 14, 2010, . a trip that ended with the murder of Flores, whom he met in . a Lima casino, on May 25. The date is a chilling one to the Holloway family, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen. He . took cash and credit cards from Miss Flores before fleeing to Chile, . where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found.

He was responsible for some of the most memorable moments in the history of British television comedy. And stars of John Sullivan's best-loved show, Only Fools and Horses, have ensured his achievements will be remembered by generations to come. Sir David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst, who played brothers Del Boy and Rodney Trotter in the BBC series, yesterday unveiled a blue plaque in the late comedy writer's honour. Stars: Only Fools and Horses actors Sir David Jason (centre) and Nicholas Lyndhurst (far right) attend the unveiling of the plaque in honour of the show's creator, John Sullivan . They were joined by other members of the cast, including John Challis, who played Del Boy's flashy friend Boycie. The blue Heritage Foundation plaque has been placed at Teddington Studios, in south-west London, where the show was filmed. It joins other plaques at the studios erected in honour of other comedy heroes including Tommy Cooper, Kenny Everett and Tony Hancock. Sullivan died in April last year aged 64 after a battle with viral pneumonia. Genius: Comedy writer John Sullivan was also created shows Just Good Friends and Citizen Smith . Only Fools and Horses was his most famous work and it brought catchphrases such as 'lovely jubbly', 'cushty', 'plonker' and 'this time next year we'll be millionaires' into living rooms across the country. It was first broadcast in 1981 and aired in seven series until 1991, with sporadic Christmas specials in later years. One festive episode in 1996 - in which Del Boy and Rodney became wealthy following the discovery and sale of a valuable watch - attracted 24.3million viewers, the highest UK audience for a sitcom. Sullivan, who was awarded the OBE in 2005, also created The Green Green Grass, Just Good Friends, Citizen Smith and Rock and Chips. He grew up in Balham, South London, born to a plumber father and mother who occasionally worked as a charlady. He failed his eleven-plus and left school at 15 with no qualifications. His first job was as a messenger boy for Reuters. Sullivan then got a job at BBC Television Centre as a scenehand at the age of 16. Always fascinated by literature and the English language, the would-be writer tried to work on as many comedy programmes as he could, in order to gain experience in the genre. During his spare time he wrote sketches. His break came when submitted one of his scripts to Dennis Main Wilson, the renowned BBC comedy producer. It met Wilson's approval and he was immediately commissioned to write more episodes. He was given three months' paid leave to work on the series, which turned out to be Citizen Smith. In December last year it emerged that Mr Sullivan left almost £8.5million in his will.

'Treated like a criminal': The mother of a 15-year-old boy (not pictured) has demanded an apology from prosecutors after he was put on trial for throwing a snowball at a teenage girl . A mother has demanded an apology from the Crown Prosecution Service after her 15-year-old son was put on trial for throwing a snowball in the face of a teenage girl. The teenager was charged with assault by beating and has been dragged to court five times since the February incident. His ordeal until only ended on Thursday when magistrates ruled there was no case to answer and threw the case out. Yesterday, the boy's mother said she was furious at prosecutors for ever bringing the case and denied her son had even thrown the snowball. The woman, who cannot be identified to protect the anonymity of her son, said: 'The past six months have been a nightmare for my son, with this ridiculous prosecution hanging over him. 'We were so relieved when the magistrates said there was no case to answer but we are angry it ever came to this. 'God only knows how much this prosecution has cost the taxpayer. We've been told it's many thousands of pounds. What a waste of money. 'My son has been treated like a criminal and for what? A snowball that may or may not have been thrown, may or may not have hit a person and in any case was not thrown by him.' The maximum sentence for an adult convicted of assault by beating is six months in custody, and the Ministry of Justice said the penalty remains the same for youth offenders - although magistrates would be more likely to take account of a defendant's young age and mitigation when sentencing at a youth court. The teenager was arrested at his home the morning after a teenage girl complained he had thrown a snowball at her at a local recreation area. The boy's mother, who lives with her family in a village near Leicester, added: 'He's only a young boy and was frightened. He was kept in a cell all day and all night.' She said her 'jaw dropped' when he was charged with assault by beating and appeared in court the following day. What cost to the taxpayer? The boy's six-month ordeal finally came to an end this week when magistrates at Leicester Youth Court (above) threw the case out. A spokesman for the CPS (headquarters above) said the prosecution was justified . The court imposed bail conditions which included a 7pm to 7am curfew. The family attended court sessions on five occasions, including a trial at Loughborough, in March, when the case was adjourned. At Thursday's Leicester Youth Court hearing, the teenage complainant and two other witnesses gave evidence. But none could be sure the boy, who had been having a snowball fight with a friend, had targeted the complainant. After listening to the prosecution case, magistrates ruled there was no case to answer. His mother added: 'The whole thing has been totally stupid.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) should have never sanctioned this prosecution.' She said she wanted an apology from the CPS. Speaking after the case, the boy said: 'I just want to put all this behind me now and get on with things. The past six months have been horrible.' A CPS spokesman said there had been 'clear evidence the complainant had been deliberately targeted and that this was more than just a youthful snowball fight.' He added: 'The evidence, including two witness statements, pointed to the fact the defendant had made and thrown the snowball and made comments of a hostile nature afterwards. 'This, coupled with the fact that the complainant was recovering from a serious eye injury, meant a court should be asked to judge the case. 'If, however, during a hearing, evidence by witnesses appears to fluctuate from the statements provided, a court can determine there is no case to answer .' Guidance issued by the Sentencing Council says custodial sentences for juveniles should only be imposed in the most serious cases. A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said: 'The incident was fully investigated and the evidence put before the CPS to decide if charges should be brought.'

Compensation: Award-winning actor David John Birrell, 46, says he was robbed of his good looks after being shot in the eye on-stage with a replica gun. He has filed a £250,000 damages claim . An award-winning actor who says he was robbed of his good looks after being shot in the eye on-stage with a replica gun has filed a £250,000 damages claim. David John Birrell, 46, was blinded in his right eye and left with an 'unsightly' disfigurement when a blank-firing replica Colt 1851 Navy revolver he was using in an on-stage duel backfired during a West End production. Mr Birrell, from Nunhead, South London, is now suing London-based theatre company Donmar Warehouse Projects Ltd, claiming the 'cosmetic disability' he suffered has blighted his career as well as his personal life. The theatre company has admitted . liability for the accident under health and safety at work regulations, . guaranteeing Mr Birrell will receive a payout. However . Donmar Warehouse denies negligence and is seeking a contribution to the . damages from the prop specialists who they say supplied the gun, . History in the Making Ltd, of, Waterlooville, Hampshire. As part of the claim, lodged at the High Court in London, Mr Birrell’s barrister, Stephen Friday, says that the actor suffered 'total and permanent blindness in the right eye' after a blank cartridge in the gun he was firing 'ejected rearwards and at high velocity through the breach cut into the revolver and into his right eye.' The accident, which took place during a production of the Stephen Sondheim play ‘Passion’ at the Donmar Warehouse, in Covent Garden in October 2010, left Mr Birrell with a 'blind right eye' which is 'shrunken and unsightly,' forcing him to now wear 'a cosmetic shell' to disguise its appearance, the document states. The prosthetic eye 'looks as if it is staring (and) looks sunken in appearance' which, coupled with 'scarring and distortion', means 'the overall effect is of marked asymmetry to the upper half of Mr Birrell’s face.' Injury: The accident took place during a production of the Stephen Sondheim play 'Passion' at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden . Mr Friday states that Mr Birrell has . undergone counselling due to his condition and is now at a disadvantage . on the labour market. It is also claimed that the actor has 'lost the facility of binocular vision, has difficulty judging distances and with hand-eye coordination, tends to collide with objects on his right hand side' and that his 'previous interests of photography, cycling fencing running swimming and squash were curtailed.' In their defence to the action, Derek O’Sullivan, for Donmar Warehouse, admits that the theatre company are liable under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998. Mr O’Sullivan states that it is 'accepted' that Mr Birrell suffered an eye injury but that the theatre company is reserving its position as to its extent and severity. The Donmar is also reserving the right to claim against the prop specialists, who are a third party in the action, stating that they have never had the chance to have the gun examined as is was 'seized almost immediately after the accident by Camden Borough Council as part of a criminal investigation, which did not result in a prosecution and has never been returned.' In their defence, lawyers for History in the Making state that the guns supplied had been serviced and cleaned prior to supply to the theatre. Accident: This Colt Navy 1851 is similar to the replica gun which half blinded actor David Birrell . They claim additionally that, in the circumstances of the accident, the contract between History in the Making and the theatre company meant that 'allocation of risk for any accident causing injury is placed on Donmar Warehouse'. History in the Making add that, 'it is currently unknown whether the gun used by Mr Birrell in the accident was one of those supplied by History in the Making and Donmar Warehouse are required to prove that it was.' They go on to claim that 'the principle factor which led to the ejection event was the use by Donmar Warehouse of defective ammunition which was not supplied by History in the Making.' They conclude that what happened to Mr Birrell was 'an accident, the circumstances of which were both outside the control of History in the Making and not reasonably foreseeable at the time of supply.' Mr Birrell who is currently appearing in two productions for the Open Air theatre company in London’s Regents Park, won the Critics’ Award for Theatre in Scotland, the Best Male Performance 2010/11 Award for his portrayal of Sweeney Todd. He was also nominated for the 2010 TMA Award for Best Performance in a Musical.","David John Birrell was blinded in his right eye and left with an 'unsightly' disfigurement following the accident .

A road safety campaigner is being quizzed on suspicion of attempted murder after his car was driven into his family home with his estranged wife and three children inside. Andrew McGarry was arrested after claims the Vauxhall Zafira may have been deliberately rammed through the front wall of the property. The 37-year-old architect is believed to have got out of the blue vehicle before it caught fire. Scene of investigation: The car was driven into the family home and exploded - no-one inside the property was hurt . Police and firefighters arrived at the scene in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester to find the car embedded in the house and engulfed in a ball of flame. At the time of the 7am incident McGarry’s estranged wife Heather, 27, and three children believed to be two boys and a girl aged between two and six were inside the £100,000 house. They all escaped uninjured. Wrecked: Police and firefighters arrived at the scene in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester to find the car embedded in the house and engulfed in a ball of flame . Today Greater Manchester Police said the suspect who was arrested near the scene of the crash was being held at a police station after also escaping injury. They are investigating whether the car was driven at the house deliberately and then set on fire afterwards - or whether the vehicle caught fire as a result of the impact. An officer stood guard at the house the front of which had been badly damaged by fire. The remains of the front wall were piled up in front of the lounge window which had been shattered by the force of the impact. One neighbour said: 'It was about 7am when I heard a loud bang and I went out to see what happened from my front door. I could see the car had collided with the wall and there was smoke and flames everywhere. Crime scene: An officer stood guard at the house the front of which had been badly damaged by fire . 'The next thing we knew was there were police everywhere and a police helicopter flying around. If one of those kiddies had been in the front room we could have been looking at a fatality.' Another neighbour said: 'There was a large bang and I came out and saw flames coming out of the front window. Quite a few people came out too. 'I only moved here in November last year and knew that a woman lived there with three kids and partner. They must have only recently split up because i thought I’d seen them together. 'I’d never heard anything untowards coming from the house or an shouting or disturbances. The children are all very small, I think two are a nursery and one at primary school.' A police spokesman said: 'Shortly after 7.05am on Tuesday 24 July 2012, police were called to Victoria Road in Horwich following a report that a car had collided with the front of a house. 'Police officers and firefighters attended and found that a Vauxhall Zafira had collided with the house and was on fire. 'Three children and a woman were inside the house at the time of the incident but were not injured. A joint investigation is being carried out by police and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service to look into the circumstances surrounding the fire.' 'A 37-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and taken into police custody for questioning.' Roads were closed temporarily whilst forensic officers examined the scene. The incident occurred after McGarry who runs his own design and architect practice campaigned for better road safety in his area after his daughter Lacey - then aged two years old - was knocked down by a car outside their home in September 2010. She survived the impact and made a full recovery but Mr McGarry collected a petition with more than 200 signatures and raised £500 towards a survey to examine better speed restrictions in the area. As a result mobile speed checks were carried out on the busy road last year. In an interview with his local paper McGarry said: 'I get really emotional when I talk about what happened to Lacey, and I am just so glad she is still here. 'I want to thank everyone who is supporting me. The roads will be a lot safer if people are reminded about the 30mph speed limit and how to spot it. 'On roads that have a lot of pedestrians and houses on each side, children can just run out into the road like my daughter did. 'If the driver is doing more than 30 mph, it can be difficult for them to stop and there can be a serious accident.' McGarry set up Facebook and Twitter pages for his firm based at the house but gave no inkling of any troubles at home - posting messages instead about his work designing loft and garage conversions.

The tiny animal, which was wearing a bright pink collar, had its mouth glued shut as well as glue on its paws, probably from where it had struggled to clear it from its face.

Staff are appealing for its owner to come forward, though the worker who found it is willing to take it in as it is such an affectionate kitten. Sergeant Iain Dickinson, of Peterlee Police, has branded those who left the kitten as 'despicable'.

The animal, believed to be two or three years old, had a rope tied around her neck when she was discovered in Detroit. However, it is unclear how she died. Animal welfare association the Michigan Humane Society (MHS) has now offered a $2,500 reward for information about the incident after the black pit bull terrier was found last week. Staggeringly, officials say it is not uncommon for graffiti taggers to target the carcasses of animals. Dumped dog: The dead animal was found on a Detroit street, spray painted with the letters PBS on her flank and a rope tightly tied around her neck . No leads: Animal welfare investigators do not know what the tag PBS means or who committed the crime. They also do not know how the pit bull terrier died . 'Detroit dog': The pit bull terrier breed has a history of being exploited in Detroit . MHS spokesman Kevin Hatman said for graffiti taggers, a dead dog is as much a blank canvas as a wall or abandoned house. He said: ‘Unfortunately, a dead dog is part of the aesthetic of the city. ‘There's graffiti all over this city, a dead dog is like a brick wall. It's a mound of spare tyres, it's an abandoned house. ‘All the dogs that get graffiti tagged are just random acts of animal cruelty.' MHS investigators are yet to . understand the meaning of the graffiti tag PBS found on the dog’s left . flank or who did the spray painting which also covered the dog's back . and legs as it lay abandoned on the road. The dog did not have any discernible . injuries and MHS are awaiting the results of a necropsy (an autopsy on . non-human bodies) to determine her cause of death.. At Detroit Dog Rescue, a no-kill . shelter, founder Daniel Carlisle called pit bulls the ‘Detroit dog’, . estimating that the breed made up 80 per cent of their rescues. He said of the graffiti tagged dog: ‘It happens all the time. This isn't anything new.’ Mr Hatman said that pit bulls are 35 to 40 per cent of dogs rescued by MHS in Detroit which has thousands of homeless dogs. He said: ‘Unfortunately the breed does have a significant history of being exploited.’","The black pit bull terrier was spray painted on her back, legs and tagged with the letters PBS on her flank .

'Targeted': Haresh Sood, 35, says racist notes were left for him shortly before he was axed from his post . A model turned teacher is suing a Catholic school for more than £100,000 after claiming he was subjected to a torrent of racist abuse from pupils and staff. The languages teacher says a  scribbled drawing of his face captioned ‘Farewell Bollywog!’ was left for him in his staff pigeonhole shortly before he was axed from his post. Haresh Sood, who was once named one of Britain’s most eligible bachelors, said he was left another note which read ‘Good Riddance Turbanator!’. The 35-year-old, who is British born but of Indian origin, also says his school register was torn and national flag removed from his classroom and dirtied. He alleges that some pupils at Nottingham’s Christ the King School called him a number of offensive racist names as well as ‘vindaloo’ and ‘chicken curry’. Mr Sood, who at the time was wearing  his hair in a distinctive Afro-like style, says a colleague at the Catholic secondary school told him to shave an Indian flag into his hair and called him a ‘t***’. In paperwork lodged with an employment tribunal, Mr Sood claims school chiefs called a staff meeting and demanded the ‘gutless wonder’ responsible own up. When no one came forward, they  compared handwriting samples from  all staff and called in police, but the  culprit was never caught. Mr Sood, from Nottingham, says he was made redundant from his £22,000-a-year post in August 2008 after complaining about the harassment. He is suing the 700-pupil school for race discrimination, harassment, unfair dismissal and victimisation. He is seeking more than £100,000 in compensation for lost earnings, aggravated damages and injury to feelings. 'Harassment': Mr Sood says a colleague at Catholic secondary school Christ the King, pictured, told him to shave an Indian flag into his hair . In 2003 he was featured by  New Woman magazine as one of Britain’s top 20 ‘hottest single men’. Mr Sood, who joined Christ  the King School in 2006, made the allegations during pre- liminary legal arguments at  Nottingham employment tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal. 'Harrassment': The actor claims he was made redundant from his £22,000-a-year post in August 2008 after complaining . The case has been mired in legal argument as Nottinghamshire County Council has attempted to have many of the 100-plus allegations struck out. Mr Sood claims he suffered racist abuse from children in May 2008 and said the school failed to deal with it. When the ‘Bollywog’ note appeared, he said he was humiliated as his boss called a staff meeting and ‘read out a passage about “wogs” not being allowed on buses in the 60s’, before inviting the ‘gutless wonder’ responsible to own up. Three days later, the second note appeared. Mr Sood, who was most recently working as a legal consultant specialising in employment law, told the appeal tribunal: ‘Other members of staff would not have been subjected to treatment of this nature or, if they had been, the problem would have been treated as a serious matter.’ Mr Sood, a University of  Leicester law graduate, then joined Rushcliffe School, in  Nottingham as a sixth-form  law teacher. He was made redundant in 2010 and sued unsuccessfully for unfair dismissal. Christ the King School denies the claims and is contesting the case, due at Nottingham employment tribunal later this year. The spokesman said the authority was now seeking to ‘recover taxpayers’ money’ spent on defending the allegations from Mr Sood. Mr Sood and Christ the King School declined to comment. A spokesperson from Nottinghamshire County Council said: 'Currently Mr Sood has a number of current claims against his former school, Christ the King School which have been ongoing since 2008 and it would not be appropriate to comment on these claims at this stage. 'However, in addition to the these claims, Mr Sood has previously issued proceedings against another former school, Rushcliffe Comprehensive School, as well as Nottinghamshire County Council separately. 'Mr Sood's claim against Rushcliffe School for unfair dismissal and victimisation was heard by a full Employment Tribunal in June of this year after which all of Mr Sood's claims were dismissed by the Employment Tribunal as groundless. 'Employment Judge Hutchinson made findings that despite Mr Sood having been legally trained and an expert in employment law, Mr Sood had ""sought to wilfully mislead the Tribunal"" over his claims. Nottinghamshire County Council is seeking to recover taxpayers' money directly from Mr Sood which has been spent on defending these proceedings. 'In respect of Mr Sood's claim against Nottinghamshire County Council, this claim has since been withdrawn by Mr Sood and Nottinghamshire County Council is also pursuing its costs in that case.'","Haresh Sood, 35, was one of Britain's top 20 hottest men in New Woman magazine .

A top prosecutor has been accused of hiding evidence in a murder case which saw the wrong man jailed for 25 years and allowed the real killer to walk free and murder again. Ken Anderson won prosecutor of the year for getting a conviction in the case of Michael Morton, from Texas, who was accused of bludgeoning his wife to death in 1986 while their three-year-old son sat in another room in their home. Morton always denied he had anything to do with his wife Christine's death and 25 years later, DNA evidence linked another man to the crime. Scroll down for video . Trial: Ken Anderson won prosecutor of the year for getting a conviction in the case of Michael Morton, center, from Texas, who was accused of bludgeoning his wife to death in 1986 . Innocent: Michael Morton was released on DNA evidence 25 years after being wrongfully convicted of the murder of his wife and is now pursuing a criminal case against the prosecutor accused of hiding evidence . Michael Morton with his wife Christine and son Eric: Christine's grandmother told police at the time that Eric said a 'monster with a big mustache' killed his mom, 'not daddy' Evidence which was said to be hidden from the defense team has lead to a criminal inquiry against Anderson. Mr Morton was jailed for life in 1987 after . being convicted of murder, despite the fact no evidence linked him directly to . the crime and he had no criminal record. His . wife was found dead at their home in Williamson County, Texas, having . been beaten with a blunt wooden object which was never found. His lawyers, who battled tirelessly for years to prove his innocence, found that prosecutors had a statement from both his son - who witnessed the brutal murder - and a neighbor, who saw a suspicious man in the area. Speaking to CBS' 60 Minutes about what it was like to walk free, Mr Morton said: 'It was so alien at first. It wasn't quite real. We stepped out of the courtroom and it was a beautiful sunny day. 'The sun felt so good on my face, on my skin. I can just feel like I was just drinking in the sunshine. Free sun feels different, I know it sounds stupid, but it does.' Accepts no blame: District Judge Ken Anderson won prosecutor of the year for getting a conviction in the case of Michael Morton and a criminal inquiry is now underway to discern if he did any wrongdoing . Taste of freedom: The moment Michael Morton walked free from court after 25 years of wrongful imprisonment with his lawyer John Raley of the Innocence Project . Confinement: The cell Michael Morton had to spend 25 years of his life would not even enable him to fully stretch out, he said prison 'eats at you like rust' Real killer?: When the defense was eventually able to DNA test a bloody bandana found at the scene, the blood of Christine Morton and the DNA of known felon Mark Alan Norwood, pictured, was present . Williamson County District Attorney Ken Anderson told the court that Morton murdered his wife because she wouldn't have sex with him, calling him violent and unremorseful. His defense attorneys suspected the prosecution was withholding evidence the whole way through the trial and it was only recently, after years of legal wrangling that they were able to obtain the file from the original trial. Lawyer for the Innocence Project John Raley said the documents they saw would have proved that Michael Morton was innocent and he would never have been sent to jail. Though an attorney for Anderson denies it would have been enough for a not-guilty verdict. Mr Raley is referring to a police report in which Christine's mother told investigators that her three-year-old grandson Eric witnessed the horrific murder and described in detail about the 'monster' with the 'big mustache' that killed his mother. Answers: Morton says he's not interested in revenge, but wants someone to be held accountable for putting him away . When asked if daddy was there, he said: 'No, mommy and Eric was there,' according to the police report. A neighbor also described seeing a suspicious man 'park a green van on the street' and 'walk into the wooded area' behind the Morton home. This was also never released by the prosecutor, who was legally and ethically obliged to release the evidence. Ken Anderson went on to be named prosecutor of the year in Texas right after Morton's conviction and since 2002 he's been a district judge in the same court where he was tried. The Innocence Project fought for five years to DNA test a bloody bandana found near the crime scene. When they were eventually granted permission, they found the blood of Christine Morton and the DNA of known felon Mark Alan Norwood, who's since been arrested for her murder. In his only public statement made since Morton was acquitted, Anderson admitted a mistake had been made but denied it being his fault. He said: 'I want to formally apologize for the system's failure to Mr Morton...In my heart I know there was no misconduct whatsoever.' In February, a Texas judge agreed with Michael Morton's legal team that there was probable cause to believe Ken Anderson violated the law, and Anderson is now the subject of a special criminal inquiry. During his 25 years in prison, Morton's son Eric - apparently convinced by others of his father's guilt - told him he did not want to have any further contact with him. They have recently been reunited and Morton has received almost $2 million compensation for his wrongful conviction. Speaking about the experience now, he told 60 Minutes: 'I try to be very forgiving. But I'll be honest, not only the actual murderer responsible for this, but the people who put me there. 'I wanted to get back at 'em. And when I finally let that go and put it away, it's like I dropped 25 pounds. I just felt ahhh. 'One of the things driving me is, I don't want this to happen to anybody else. Revenge isn't the issue here. Revenge, I know, doesn't work. But accountability works. It's what balances out. It's the equilibrium.'","DNA evidence linked killing to different man quarter of a century on .

The tropical countries of Cuba, Vietnam and the Seychelles are all being considered as possible locations, Russia's naval chief has confirmed. Sailors in the Russian Navy can look forward to sunnier climes with one of their potential exotic base locations . Exotic: The Seychelles is just one of the tropical climates being considered for the new base . Russia has been sending warships further afield in a bid to increase the reach of its navy in recent years. The move is part of an effort to restore pride project power in a world dominated by the U.S. military. Vice Admiral Viktor Chirkov said in an interview: 'It's true that we are continuing work on providing the navy with basing outside the Russian Federation.' The Soviet Union had a large naval base . in Communist ally Vietnam but post-Soviet Russia opted to vacate the Cam . Ranh base in 2002 - during President Vladimir Putin's first Kremlin . term - because rent payments were a burden on state coffers. River view: The mountainous landscapes of Vietnam could make a nice change from icy Siberian winters . The only Russian naval facility outside of the former Soviet Union is a maintenance and supply facility in the Syrian port of Tartous. However, its future is uncertain because of the conflict in Syria. Chirkov . said Russia was 'working out the issue of creating sites for material . and technical support on the territory of Cuba, the Seychelles and . Vietnam.' Chirkov's wording suggested facilities . in those countries might be less extensive than full-scale naval bases. Navy officials could not immediately be reached for comment. The Caribbean island of Cuba is also being considered for the location of the new base . Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang, who was in Russia and was to meet Putin on Friday, was quoted as telling a Russian radio station that Vietnam has 'no intention of cooperating with any country with the aim of military use of the port of Cam Ranh'.

Two brothers have been jailed for life for decapitating a man after beating, stabbing and shooting him, then setting his corpse on fire. Anthony and Joseph Jenkins killed John Grainger in January this year after the three had been drinking in various pubs in Stockport town centre. A pathologist who later examined Mr Grainger’s body said the injuries were so severe his skull had 'largely distintegrated' and had 'essentially fallen to pieces.' Joseph, left, claimed brother Anthony Jenkins had carried out the attack alone . Mr Grainger, described by his family as 'very sociable and friendly', died in the frenzied attack at the brothers' flat after Anthony Jenkins was kicked out of a nightclub for spraying beer around the dancefloor. Anthony Jenkins, 31, had pleaded guilty earlier in the trial, while his 30-year-old brother was today convicted of murder at Manchester Crown Court. The pair were sentenced to life in prison and must serve a minimum of 30 years and 32 years respectively before they can be considered for parole. Murder victim John Grainger was described as 'very sociable and friendly' Tests showed that the pair had tried to saw Mr Grainger's head off with a bread knife before turning to a motorised saw during the attack in the early hours of January 26. The court heard how Mr Grainger was severely beaten, hit on the head with a hammer, stabbed in the legs and was then shot in the knee and point blank in the head. The brothers took his body to the bathroom where he was decapitated. Earlier in the trial prosecuter Graham Reeds, QC told the court: 'Once dead his body was taken into a bathroom where it was decapitated. His head was put into a plastic shopping bag and his body into a plastic or canvas wheeled holdall. 'His body was then taken along with the head, a can of petrol and the gun, down two flights of stairs through the communal hallway and to a wooded area. 'This was a task for which two people were needed. John Grainger weighed around 12 stone 11 pounds. Once in the wood his body was set alight using petrol to accelerate the fire.' The blaze was spotted by a casino worker on his way home and firefighters alerted police when they realised a body was on fire. The Jenkins brothers were spotted acting suspiciously a kilometre away from their flat, having changed their clothes. Police found six live shotgun cartridges in Anthony Jenkins' pocket and saw blood on his shoe. They then received a radio message about the burning corpse and arrested the pair. Police found large blood stains on the walls and furniture when they searched the flat on Wellington Street, Stockport. The power saw the brothers used to decapitate Mr Grainger was covered in blood and still plugged into an extension lead. The gun was found under a parked car nearby, while a hammer, butterfly knife, bread knife, Stanley knife and razor were found in the bath. The Jenkins brothers had attempted to clean up with a mop and bucket of bleach. Their clothes were in the washing machine. Joseph Jenkins had previously claimed that he went off with a woman after leaving the XXL nightclub, leaving the two other men. Forensic officers and coroners take Mr Grainger's body away from the scene . When he returned to the flat, he told the court he found bloodstained clothes in the hallway and was shocked to be told by his brother: 'That lad John, I’ve done him.' Senior Investigating Officer Andy Tattersall from the Major Incident Team said: 'The Jenkins brothers put Mr Grainger through a horrifically violent and cruel attack before shooting him. What followed was nothing short of macabre.' Chief Superintendent Chris Sykes from Greater Manchester Police’s Stockport Division said: 'The gap left by Mr Grainger’s untimely death has proved impossible to fill but I hope this sentence goes a little way in helping his loved ones get on with their lives.'","John Grainger's skull had 'essentially fallen to pieces'

Anxious: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is under tremendous pressure to make sure his company does well following its IPO . Facebook posted its revenue of $1.2billion this afternoon in its first earnings report since going public. It comes as good news to the social network, which has been struggling to recover its image with investors after its botched initial public offering in May. The revenue report shows that Facebook is up 32 per cent in worth from last year, welcome news for a struggling Wall Street. However, the market closed with shares of Facebook down at $26.84, an 8.5 per cent loss. According to CNET News, the second quarter earnings have a profit of 12 cents a share. Following the botched initial public offering in May, Facebook was under tremendous pressure to perform well financially. The report, released after closing bell today, will reveal the social media giant’s first performance as a public company. But with stocks tumbling from $38 a share down to less than $30 as of July 25th, the news may be grim indeed for the company, helmed by 28-year-old CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Its shares tumbled ahead of its first quarterly results announcement, hurt by a weak quarterly report and a foreboding outlook from online game developer Zynga, which hosts popular games like Farmville. Facebook Inc shares dropped seven per cent to $27.65 in pre-market trading while Zynga Inc slumped a staggering 40 per cent to $3.04 – the two most heavily traded stocks before the bell on Nasdaq. Waiting game: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during afternoon trading on the 24th; investors and analysts are highly anticipating Facebook's earnings report . Tense times: Investors, seen on the floor of the NYSE on July 24, looked apprehensive, left, and right, Facebook's share price fell to a low of $25.87 on June 5th and has shakily landed at $29.34 . And investors are bracing themselves for what could be some very bad news. 'Considering . that Zynga was a recent IPO, it's another black eye for Wall Street. You bring up an IPO and you get burnt again and again,' Joe Saluzzi, . co-founder of Themis Trading LLC in Chatham, New Jersey, told Reuters. Zynga's . results are 'not creating good confidence in the sector as they (social . media companies are) certainly related to each other.' The fate of the two companies is intertwined, with Zynga's games, such as 'FarmVille' and 'CityVille,' helping to make up more than a tenth of Facebook's revenue last year. Late on Wednesday, Zynga slashed its 2012 outlook and the company's quarterly results badly missed Wall Street targets. A number of brokerages cut their price targets on the company on Thursday, including Wedbush, Citigroup and Lazard, casting some uncertainty over Facebook ahead of its inaugural results after the close of trading Thursday. Earlier this week, the options market was forecasting a 14 per cent move up or down in Facebook shares following the results. That means options investors expect the stock to rise to as much as $32 by Friday or to fall to as low as $24. Since the IPOs, shares of Facebook and Zynga have been in a downward spiral. Facebook, at $28.45, is off nearly $10 from its market debut price of $38 in May, and Zynga is at $4.92, nearly half its debut price of $9.50 in December. Excitement: Onlookers in Times Square took pictures of Zuckerberg, seen on a screen moments after Facebook's IPO in May . Despite the steep decline in their share prices, Facebook and Zynga are both trading well above their market valuations. Facebook is still trading at around 70 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. An analysis by Thomson Reuters StarMine puts the company's intrinsic value at a modest $9.72 a share, or about one third its current value, based on estimates of the company's projected growth for the next decade. Earlier in the week, analysts, on average, were expecting revenue in the second quarter to grow 28 percent to $1.15billion. With over 900million users, Facebook is the world's largest social networking company, challenging established Web companies for consumers' online time and for advertising revenue.","Facebook's first revenue report since IPO beat estimates .

A legless skateboarder who made 'high pitched screeching' sounds on his flute for cash has been handed an ASBO for his noisy ways. Viorel Dinu, 23, was arrested after police officers were alerted to a 'high pitched screeching' sound coming from outside John Lewis in Oxford Street, central London. They found the Romanian double amputee, who wheels himself along on his skateboard, playing his instrument with about £150 in takings. The sound of screeching music: Viorel Dinu was fined and ordered to stay out of the City of Westminster for two years . Dinu was charged under a 173-year-old law with using a 'noisy instrument' in a public place for the purpose of obtaining money. But Dinu insists it was his disability, rather than his playing, that was upsetting people. Louisa Ricottini, defending, said: 'My parents used to think that The Beatles were making a screeching noise. 'It is a matter of opinion what screeching is.' Dinu, who has lived in the UK for 10 . months, lost his legs in an accident when he was child, Westminster . Magistrates' Court heard. 'On . July 19 at about 3.45pm the defendant was outside John Lewis in Oxford . Street playing a recorder type instrument which makes a high pitched . screeching noise,' said prosecutor Senghin Kong . Out of tune: Dinu busked outside John Lewis store in London's Oxford Street . 'The defendant was placing himself in a . prominent place blocking the flow of pedestrians on the pavement and . the pedestrians were seen to be recoiling from him. 'He shouldn't have been in the place where he was blocking the flow on a busy street.' Ms . Ricottini said people were not moving away from him because of the . noise he was making but because he was 'somebody who was using the . skateboard as his feet'. Although police referred to the instrument as a recorder Dinu refers to it as a flute, the court heard. Dinu, . who travelled from his home in Nottingham to busk on the streets of . London, has previous convictions for begging outside Selfridges and Gap, . also on Oxford Street. 'Is that causing alarm and distress?' she said. District . Judge Justin Barron told Dinu, who wheeled himself into court on his . skateboard: 'There are very significant problems from begging in this . area in London because so many people are doing it. 'There is no doubt that it is a big problem. What the prosecution are saying to me is that you are a problem. 'It is clear to me that the way that you beg whether it is playing your recorder or whatever does cause harassment. 'I do not accept that this was to do with your disability or being on a skateboard but that they were just being harassed by your behaviour. 'It seems to me that there is pretty good evidence that you are living on the proceeds of begging and busking. 'You are probably making good income from begging and busking. 'I think you had £150 on you that day, that is more than most members of the public would have on them,' he added. The Romanian was handed an ASBO banning him from entering the City of Westminster for two years. He was also fined £35, ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £15 and prosecution costs of £85. Dinu, of Nottingham, admitted using a noisy instrument in a public place for the purpose of obtaining money, under the Metropolitan Police Act 1839.","Busker says it is his disability, rather than his playing, that upsets people .

A teenager used his grandfather’s war bayonet to slaughter a lamb before trying to cook it on a campfire in front of his shocked friend, a court heard. Alex Sleigh, 18, stabbed the animal in the chest before carrying it back to the group of campers who called police. Burnley Crown Court heard how the teenager told police he had intended hunting and killing for his own pleasure and said it would have been more fun if the animal had 'put up more of a struggle'. Cruel: Alex Sleigh stabbed a lamb because 'he was hungry' - telling police he wished it had put up more of a struggle (File photo) Officers then found a cache of weapons under Sleigh’s bed and recovered some 'concerning' documents from his home. Natalia Cornwall, prosecuting, said Sleigh was camping in March this year in Rivington, Lancashire, with a group of about 20 youths. She told the court how Sleigh left the group and returned carrying a dead lamb. When asked where he had got it from, the court heard he replied: 'I have just killed it'. He told the group he did it because he was hungry and then cut off one leg, put it on a skewer and tried to cook it, before throwing it away complaining it wasn't cooking. Some of the group were unhappy and called the police who discovered a knife in his bag and a large bayonet-style knife covered in blood. Sleigh, who has no previous convictions, told the police he had not killed any animals before but had thought of hunting for a while. Alex Sleigh, 18, had gone camping with a group of 20 youths when he killed the animal (file photo of camping tents) Andy Pilkington, defending, said: 'They are concerning offences, to say the least. He has not done it with the intention of killing an animal for any sadistic purposes.' Sleigh, said by a judge to have a 'worrying interest in weaponry and explosives', was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome after the incident and has had treatment. He admitted possessing a bladed article and causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. The teenager, from Blackrod, Bolton, was given a two-year supervision order and was banned from owning or keeping animals for five years. Mr Pilkington said the offences were the catalyst for Sleigh, currently on a work placement in catering, being diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. Sentencing Sleigh, Judge Simon Newell, who had read medical reports from two psychiatrists, told him: 'Both doctors take the view you are not a significant risk to the general public, but there are concerns as a result of Asperger’s as to your future and possible future criminality.' The judge added he hoped funding could be made available for specialist treatment for Sleigh. He said: 'We hope this is one-off behaviour. I am sure it is. I hope that with the support of your family and the probation service you can put in place around you such structures as will help you lead a law abiding life in the future.'","Alex Sleigh, 18, told police he wished the lamb had 'put up more of a struggle'

Mr Mann kept up his counterattack, grabbing three more of the heavy boxes and hurling them, with one smashing the hooded robber on his leg. Another case crashed into shelving, causing a stack of baskets to tumble to the ground. Deterred by the fierce resistance, the would-be robber ran from the shop and fled on foot.

An Olympic coach who helped to bring the 2012 Games' sailing events to Weymouth was crushed to death in an avalanche while skiing, an inquest heard today. David Robinson had been out on the slopes with wife Christine Hughes and a group of friends when the couple were engulfed in the torrent of snow. His chest was crushed by the impact of the thick snow piling on top of him and he was trapped, unconscious, while his friends and rescuers desperately tried to find him. Accidental death: David Robinson was caught in an avalanche while skiiing in Val d'Isere . The 67-year-old father of two, who once coached Great Britain’s sailing team, was eventually found and taken to hospital but died the following day. Speaking at the conclusion of the inquest into her husband’s death today, Ms Hughes, said that she had been 'spooked' that the hearing had taken place in the midst of the Olympic sailing competition. Mr Robinson had put forward Weymouth, Dorset, as a venue for the games. 'It’s quite poignant this, that the inquest, was done in the middle of the Olympics,' she said. 'He was an ex-Olympic sailing coach and it was his idea that they had the sailing at Weymouth when he was the Olympic coach in 1970. 'He would have been absolutely over the moon that they have held the sailing there. He loved the mountains and the sea: Mr Robinson had been Olympic sailing coach preparing Team GB for the '72 Games in Munich . 'He had registered to be a volunteer at the 2012 Olympics and he had suggested that Weymouth would have been a great venue.' Ms Hughes said that her husband had been appointed as one of sailing’s first Olympic coaches in 1970 in preparation for the 1972 games in Munich. 'He had such a love of life, he had so much charisma,' she added. 'He used to say that the best things in life were the sea and the mountains, it’s a shame that it was one of those loves that took him from us so soon. 'However, he would not have wanted it any other way.' As keen skiiers, Mr Robinson and Ms Hughes, from the Hamble, Southampton, were frequent visitors to the Alpine ski resort of Val d’Isere and had been staying there over Christmas in 2010. On Boxing Day they and a group of friends had gone out for an 'off piste' trek on the Combe de Signal slope, aided by professional instructor Wayne Watson. The inquest at Winchester Coroner’s Court, Hampshire, was told that all of them were experienced skiiers but would always go out with Mr Watson, a friend of the couple, for safety reasons. The group had been out at around 8.30am, the morning after snow had fallen in the area - where the risk of an avalanche was relatively low. As part of a further attempt to stay safe they were told to stay around 50ft apart, and Ms Hughes said that each skiier would wait until the one in front of them had cleared the section before setting off. However, one skiier was believed to have stopped unexpectedly - leading French investigators to suspect that the snow mantle had become overloaded, causing the avalanche. Ms Hughes said that she had been standing on the slope when she heard a 'woomph' noise and saw cracks appearing in the snow beneath her. 'The whole thing started to go sideways, I was thinking about what was happening to me,' she said, explaining that she had not seen her husband. 'When I started to go sideways I was on my own there with the snow starting to move, that’s when I thought maybe I should pull my handle.' Off-piste: The mountains in Val d'Isere, France, where Mr Robinson met his tragic end . Each skiier in the group was wearing a backpack with an emergency air bag they could deploy to prevent them from being trapped under the snow. Ms Hughes said she had struggled to inflate her air bags, and was only able to do so once she had already fallen into the snow. 'I was face down in the snow, it was only when I heard the charge go off that I knew the balloons had inflated,' she said. Despite not inflating fully, the bright orange balloons still made her easy for rescuers to spot - unlike Mr Robinson, who was unable to deploy his. The inquest heard that it took rescuers around 20 minutes to find him, trapped under one metre of snow and having suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest. He was taken to hospital in nearby Grenoble but died the following day. 'He would have been absolutely over the moon': Finn class sailors Ben Ainslie of Great Britain, left, and Jonas Hogh-Christensen of Denmark compete in the 2012 Games at Weymouth . A post-mortem examination revealed that his cause of death had been fractured ribs and trauma to the chest, although he also had bruises to his head. Grahame Short, coroner for Central Hampshire, said that he was in no doubt that Mr Robinson was an experienced skiier and that all safety precautions necessary had been taken. 'It’s fair to say that avalanches can be caused by many factors, it was probably as a result of the skiiers on the slope in the area at the same time,' he said. 'That is an inherent risk of skiing. 'The avalanche started and although Ms Hughes was able to inflate her air bag I don’t think that Mr Robinson had a chance to do so because it happened so quickly.' Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Short told Ms Hughes that she had been lucky to escape unharmed from the avalanche. 'So much in these events is an element of chance and he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.'","David Robinson, who was Olympic sailing coach in 1970, had suggested the seaside town as a 'great venue' for the event .

David Cameron and his cabinet colleagues have discussed fully nationalising the Royal Bank of Scotland because they are angry about how little British banks are lending. Senior members of the Coalition want to buy out the remaining 18 per cent of the institution and then ramp up how much it loans out to boost the UK's depressed economy. RBS is already 82 per cent publicly-owned and a further £5 billion would be needed to complete a taxpayer-funded takeover. Deal: British giant Royal Bank of Scotland is already 82% taxpayer owned and the Government is said to have discussed buying up the remaining shares . Chancellor George Osborne is opposed to fully nationalising RBS, which would mean taxpayers taking full responsibility for the bank's toxic debts. But his rival, Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable, is in favour of a split in RBS to create a business bank with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending. A Treasury spokesman told MailOnline: 'This is wild speculation: we are committed to repairing and returning RBS to full health so that it is able to support the UK economy in the future, and the current strategy is working to achieve that. 'The Government’s policy has always been to return RBS to the private sector, but only when it delivers value for money for the taxpayer.' Yesterday the Chancellor launched his latest scheme to free up credit by offering lower interest rates to banks, but some at the top of Government believe forcing RBS to lend more is the only way to push the banks into action and get money to cash-starved businesses in particular. 'We can understand why Labour didn't want to do this: it would be politically disastrous for them to nationalise a bank,' one senior adviser told the Financial Times but added the banking sector would be much less worried if the Coalition made this move. Split: Chancellor George Osborne is said to be opposed to any full takeover of RBS but Business Secretary Vince Cable is believed to be more open to it . This would mean directing the bank to increase its lending to companies, which would be open to legal challenge by the remaining shareholders. The only way to get round this is to buy out those shareholders. A full nationalisation was not on the agenda, an industry source also said, citing several reasons why the Treasury would not have the appetite for such a move. In addition to the extra cost, EU regulators would be unlikely to allow a state-owned RBS to aggressively undercut rivals on lending, and the government would attract more criticism for bonuses, lending and issues like the Libor interest rate rigging scandal if it wholly owned RBS, he said.","Cabinet consider buying remaining 18% of bank for £5 billion .

The ringleader of a gang of men who groomed vulnerable girls for sex has today also been jailed for 22 years for a 'campaign of rape' against a different child in his own community. Shabir Ahmed, 59, led an exploitation ring of nine men who were all imprisoned earlier this year after they abused many young girls in the Rochdale and Oldham areas. He was jailed for 19 years in May following an 11-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court relating to their violent abuse. And today he can be named as he received another prison term - to run concurrently - after he was also convicted in June of 30 counts of child rape in his own area. His identity was kept secret to allow him a fair trial. A jury heard he raped and sexually abused the innocent youngster over many years and treated her as a 'possession' whom he used for his own sexual gratification. Ahmed, of Oldham, will in effect serve an additional three years to the sentence imposed at Liverpool Crown Court. Sentencing him at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, Judge Mushtaq Khokhar was forced to removed Ahmed from the dock before he passed sentence as he was persistently interrupted by the defendant. Before his ejection, Ahmed shouted: 'It’s all lies. It’s all concocted by the police.' He then looked over at the Press bench and snarled: 'What are you looking at?' The court heard that Ahmed remained 'in denial' of his guilt of the repeated rapes of his victim for more than a decade. His victim was 'completely vulnerable' and too young to understand what was happening to her when he first abused her. It then became a case of control and power amid a background of 'intimidation and coercion', said the judge. Jailed: The rapist was jailed again at Minshull Street Manchester Crown Court just two months after being jailed for his part in a large sex gang . On occasion she would protest and cry but Ahmed would continue, he added. The judge said an aggravating feature was that the defendant did not use any protection while raping the girl. The jury in his trial was told that the victim felt a sense of shame about what happened to her, which stopped her reporting it to the police for many years. She had 'rejected the idea of ever marrying or having a sexual relationship with a man of her choosing' because of the impact of what she had suffered. Today the court heard the victim suffered from low self-confidence and had been forced to move away because she cannot face people in her community. Judge Khokhar said: 'Her future prospects are bleak, as she puts it. 'She still lives under fear because of what the defendant might do when he comes out of prison.' Explaining his sentencing, he said: 'These are serious offences but I have taken care in considering whether a life sentence is appropriate in this case. Shame: The abuse of the gang he ran began at two takeaways in the Heywood area of Rochdale, including the Balti House (pictured), which is under new ownership . Also . under new ownership: The Tasty Bites takeaway - now renamed Bakar's and . sold on to new owners - was the other takeaway at the centre of the . scandal . 'Given that the defendant is already serving a 19-year sentence that was imposed earlier this year at another court, I think that in my judgment the public will be protected from him, as will the victim, if I was to pass a determinate sentence in this case which will run concurrently to the sentence he is already serving. 'This was a campaign of rape. There are no extenuating circumstances.' Ahmed's life as an abuser was laid bare by his involvement, kept secret until today, with a sex gang that terrorised a large area of north west England. He and several others raped vulnerable teenage girls - who he told to call him 'Daddy'. The pervert would befriend his teenage victims and ply them with alcohol before carrying out his attacks. The . takeaway worker and former taxi driver was given a 19-year sentence for . conspiracy, two rapes, aiding and abetting rape, sexual assault and sex . trafficking. One of Ahmed's victims in the original grooming case said his public naming-and-shaming had finally brought her some closure. The . girl - who was herself raped by Ahmed after he plied her with vodka . above the Tasty Bites takeaway in Heywood - said: 'I'm just glad people . can know who he is and what he's done. He's just such an evil man. I . know what he's done to me - it's obvious now from this second trial that . he's been doing this for years and ruined a lot of lives. 'If . anybody deserves to spend the rest of their lives in prison, it's him. I'm just relieved it's all over - it's some kind of justice.' Her . father, who watched from the public gallery as Ahmed was convicted in May said: 'He is horrible, evil - the vilest, most . perverted individual.

House of Reeves was founded in 1867 as the Ye Olde Curiosities Shoppe in Church Street by Edwin Reeves, who handed the business down to his son, William. It was one of the few buildings in Croydon to survive The Blitz during the Second World War. After the war, the store changed name and was later passed to Maurice Reeves. It became known as the House of Reeves and the corner where it was situated was named Reeves Corner. A decision has yet to be made about what will happen to the land at Reeves Corner where the destroyed shop stood. Gordon Thompson, 34, was jailed for 11-and-a-half years in April for starting the fire, after changing his plea to guilty three days into his Old Bailey trial.","Destruction of House of Reeves among the most evocative images of unrest .

David takes on Goliath: Richard Gollin, who runs the six-bed roomed Baille na Cille guesthouse, claims that negative criticism posted about his business are false . For millions of holidaymakers, it is an online bible that helps them to pick the best hotels – and avoid the worst. But one Hebridean guest house owner claims some of the candid hotel and restaurant reviews posted by users around the world on Trip-Advisor have harmed his business. Now former college lecturer Richard Gollin is to sue the world's largest travel website in a landmark case. He claims false and negative postings on the website have driven away potential customers. Mr Gollin, who runs the six-bedroomed  beachside Baille na Cille guest house at an idyllic spot in Uig on the west coast of Lewis, claims some of the negative criticism about his business should have been removed by TripAdvisor. He is taking on the might of the international travel guide, which is valued on the US stock exchange at more than £2billion, over suspected malicious postings he says hit his income. In a David and Goliath battle, Mr Gollin, 64, has begun a small claims action at Stornoway Sheriff Court. He believes the website is rife with inaccurate or false guest reviews. Postings include one from a guest who criticised the food and claimed visitors were under-fed. Another review included criticism of extra charges for a phone bill. Mr Gollin said: 'We are the most smallest, westerly remote guest house in Britain and we are taking on one of the largest travel guide companies. 'False criticisms': Baille na Cille has been 'hurt' by postings that Mr Gollin says should have been removed from the travel guide . 'I believe TripAdvisor is in dereliction . of duty in failing to have proper supervision of what goes on their . website. All across the country people should stand up to TripAdvisor.' Mr Gollin claims he has lost bookings as a result of negative and false postings and is seeking compensation from the US-based firm. On TripAdvisor, Mr Gollin's B&B has a mark of four stars out of five, with 41 out of 50 people rating it as 'very good' or 'excellent'. But some people have made complaints: . One user wrote: 'It is in a stunning location however the room was freezing cold and there was no hot water to have a wash.' Another wrote: 'Found the owner patronising and pompous.' Another user said: 'The dining room decor was distateful (sic) to us - filled with war memorabilia. The room was clean, but horribly ordinary.' The amount he is seeking has not been . disclosed, though £3,000 is the maximum limit available under the small . claims procedure. Londoners Mr Gollin and his wife Joanna, 52, the guest house chef, came to Lewis on honeymoon in the late 1970s and later relocated permanently. Mr Gollin worked as a business studies lecturer at Lews Castle College in Stornoway before leaving to concentrate on the guest house. He said: 'Anyone can go on the TripAdvisor site and within two minutes could post a fake review about the Ritz Hotel in London, for example, without even being there – they could just make it up.' Mr Gollin said he asked TripAdvisor to remove false postings but claims the company ignored him. The negative comments posted on the reviews website referred to the meals, the age of the building, the host himself and the beds. TripAdvisor insists in court submissions it is not subject to the law in Scotland and its legal team, from its Massachusetts headquarters, has instructed Stornoway lawyer Angus Macdonald. He is asking Sheriff David Sutherland to throw the case out of court, claiming it is outwith Scottish jurisdiction. Mr Gollin was originally representing himself but has now hired lawyer Duncan Burd. Court papers were lodged yesterday but the case has been continued to a later date. TripAdvisor, owned by the Expedia travel website firm, is valued at £2.3billion. Earlier this year its founder, Stephen Kaufer, defended the site, saying: 'Hotels would ring us saying, ""We've been given a terrible review, take it down"". But that's against everything we are meant to do, which is to create transparency.' Asked about Mr Gollin's case last night, a TripAdvisor spokesman said: 'We do not comment on threatened or pending litigation.'","Mr Gollin says false and negative postings on the travel guide website are driving away business .

Andy Murray, one of Team GB's strong podium hopefuls, has moved within one match of securing at least a silver medal at the Olympic Games after dismantling Spaniard Nicolas Almagro in today's quarter-final. The Scot - who lost only a month ago in the Wimbledon final to Roger Federer - is desperate to earn a gold medal at the Games after his plucky defeat at SW19, and must progress through the semi-final and the final to fulfill his dream. Serbia's Novak Djokovic or France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga await the Scot now, and he could meet world No 1 Federer in the final. Winner: Andy Murray progressed to the semi-finals with ease . Easy: Murray must expect tougher opposition if he is to get the elusive Olympic gold . Being cheered on by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, his Mother, Judy, and girlfriend Kim Sears - the Scot sought to take the game to his opponent. Murray was out of the blocks flying, and was a break up after Almagro's third service game, breaking the Spaniard to love. The Spaniard scuppered his chances to . get back into the game by double-faulting, handing the Team GB player . the initiative, and Murray dominated the opening set from there on, as . Almagro appeared to be struggling with a shoulder injury. Before the match Murray was a strong . favourite to win against Almagro, who is ranked 10th in the ATP tour, . and the Spaniard looked out of sorts against the Team GB player. The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William were at the match to cheer on Andy Murray . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were keen to show their support for Murray by getting involved in the Mexican wave . Thank heavens for that: Murray did his signature salute to the skies after winning against Almagro . Great Britain's No 1 fought back in the last round to see off old foe Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in three sets after a tense encounter. The 26-year-old had to turn the match on its head after going a set down to the wily European. But Almagro provided no such resistance. After a routine first set, which Murray took 6-4, the Spaniard appeared . to be suffering further with his shoulder. A brief encounter: The Duke and Duchess saw Murray beat his opponent in under an hour . Nicolas Almagro seemed to suffer with a shoulder complaint after the first set . Murray did not let up on the world No 10, and hammered him in the second set 6-1 after breaking to love in the first game. After winning he threw his wrist bands in the air, and roared before his signature salute to the skies before leaving the court, proving just how much an Olympic podium place would mean to him. The Briton has an unbelievably busy Olympic schedule, as he is due to partner up with Laura Robson in the mixed-doubles, and if he wants to get on the podium twice, he must play two more singles matches and four mixed doubles matches before Sunday. Come on Andy! Fans gather on Henman Hill (or Murray Mound) to show their support for the Team GB star . Sea of colour: The British turned up to watch the action unfold on centre court . Making her way down: The Duchess of Cambridge makes her way through the crowd to get to her seats as William follows closely behind . The pair were handed a wildcard entry into the Games yesterday, and regardless what happens in the match with Almagro, will be on centre court this evening. After his tearful Wimbledon final defeat to Federer, Murray is on course to take an Olympic medal one way or the other. But with Djokovic or Tsonga lying in wait, it will still be tough for the Scot to achieve gold or silver. Federer meanwhile must make his way through American John Isner later today. Although many of the big names - Isner, Tsonga, Djokovic and Federer - may stand in Murray's way, current Olympic champion Rafael Nadal was ruled out with a knee injury. But British fans should be thankful that Rafael Nadal was ruled out of the tournament with a knee injury he sustained in the French Open. The Spaniard was due to bear the flag for his nation in the opening ceremony, but struggled to overcome the injury he sustained on his way to winning the French Open. William and Kate arrived at court one shortly before play got under way in the third seed's quarter final match against Spain's Nicolas Almagro. Eyes for each other: William and Kate seemed distracted as they chatted between points in the match . Ouch: Almagro seemed to be suffering from a shoulder strain as he succumbed to defeat by Murray . Kate, wearing a royal blue dress, navy blazer and dark glasses, smiled as the crowd greeted the couple with a round of applause as they took their seats in the stand. William, also wearing a navy blazer, chatted to spectators sitting nearby. Murray was given an even greater reception as the match began, with the partisan crowd waving Union flags and roaring at every point he won. The couple clapped enthusiastically as Murray took the lead in the first set, while support for the 25-year-old Wimbledon 2012 finalist also came from his mother Judy Murray and girlfriend Kim Sears. The tennis is the latest in a number of Olympic events attended by William and Kate, who earlier this week visited the athletes' village to meet members of Team GB. Full house: Although there were a few empty seats at the beginning of the contest, the stands soon filled up . The Duke and Duchess looked relaxed as they chatted to each other between the points, and seemed happy to join in the fun with the crowd, taking part in the Mexican waves which spread around the stands during the change-overs. The couple rose to their feet when Murray clinched victory and were given another round of applause as they left the stands, while Murray walked off the court to deafening cheers. Despite the crowd's enthusiasm for the British number one's Olympics bid, there were still rows of empty seats in the stands, particularly in the lower tiers. Hundreds of fans visiting the All England Club without tickets to the match gathered outside the court on Murray Mound to watch the action on the big screen.","Britain's No 1 tennis player wins 6-4 6-1 against Nicolas Almagro in quarter-final of Games .

A thug plunged a hypodermic needle into the neck of a woman as she stood at her front door in a gruesome but apparently random attack. After knocking at the front door, the attacker issued a sinister threat to his 41-year-old victim before thrusting the syringe in her neck and running off. The woman, whose name has not been released, was rushed to hospital for treatment, where doctors tested her for hepatitis and Aids. Hypodermic needles are commonly used by heroin addicts. Used needles can harbour blood-borne diseases that can permanently affect the lives of those who contract them. She was later discharged after tests came back all clear. Today, Greater Manchester Police said officers were investigating a theory that the woman was attacked in a horrifying case of mistaken identity. The thug struck just after noon on Sunday July 29, after knocking on the door of the woman's home in Blackley, Manchester. Police said she opened it to see who it was before the man pushed and threatened her. He then speared her with the syringe before yanking it from her neck and fleeing down the street. The woman has told police she did not know the man who stabbed her - although the assault appeared to be targeted, leading to the theory that it was a case of mistaken identity. Health risk: The woman, whose name has not been released, was rushed to hospital for treatment, where doctors tested her for hepatitis and Aids .

And that was certainly the case this morning as Sarah Attar, the first female track athlete to compete for Saudi Arabia in the Olympics, was cheered every step of the way in her 800m heat. In the end, she completed the two laps of the track nearly 45 seconds behind the winner, but her participation alone represented an historic moment. Scroll down for video . Saudi Arabia's Sarah Attar (centre) waves to the crowd in the Olympic Stadium as she lines up in heat six of the women's 800m this morning . Attar completed the two laps of the 800m in a time of two minutes 44.95 seconds, nearly 45 seconds behind the leader . Attar enters and empty home straight on the second lap of her heat. She wore a white hijab, green long-sleeved top and jogging bottoms to comply with her country's rules on female modesty . Dressed in a long-sleeved green training top, long jogging bottoms and a white hijab, she certainly stood out on the start line in sweltering heat in the Olympic Stadium. And it was quickly obvious that Attar wasn't going to be able to keep pace with the rest of the field as she fell a long way behind. But whatever the sport, Olympic crowds love a plucky trier and Attar was given a standing ovation as she crossed the finish line, almost a full lap behind the others. Her time of two minutes 44.95 seconds was a long way behind that recorded by the winner, Kenya's Janeth Jepkosgei Busienei, who ran two minutes 01.04 seconds. Attar started in lane eight in heat six of the 800m in the Olympic Stadium . Attar, 19, studies art at the Pepperdine University in Malibu, California. She has dual Saudi and American nationality but chose to compete for the homeland of her father . It doesn't matter though, because Attar is making history as one half of the first ever women's team to represent Saudi Arabia. Speaking after the race, she said: . 'It is such an honour to be representing Saudi Arabia. Hopefully this . can make such a huge difference. 'It was such a unique opportunity [to . represent Saudi Arabia], they invited me and welcomed me and to make . that first step for women is just the most amazing feeling ever.' Her run today was four seconds slower than her personal best time. But the 800m isn't Attar's strongest race as she's more comfortable at 1500m distance . The other competitors had long since crossed the line - second from last Elisabeth Mandaba of the Central African Republic was 32 second quicker . Attar is the first female Saudi track athlete to participate in the Olympics after the nation's Olympic Committee overturned a ban on women. She was given a standing ovation as she crossed the finish line . She was all smiles after the race, despite being the slowest competitor . Members of the press scrambled to grab a few words from Attar after the race . Her teammate, the judoka Wojdan Shaherkani, wrote her name into Olympic history on Friday when she was defeated by Puerto Rican Melissa Mojica in a first round bout. The fight only lasted a minute but Shaherkani will forever have the distinction of being the first Saudi female Olympian. The pair were forced to walk behind the male Saudi athletes in the Opening Ceremony parade of nations, a symbol of an ultra-conservative country in which women are actively discouraged from participating in sport. The judoka Wojdan Shaherkani (left), getting to grips with Puerto Rican Melissa Mojica in a first round bout, is the other woman in the Saudi squad . Both were given rapturous receptions by the British crowds as they took part in their events and their presence in London represents a giant stride forward for gender equality in their country. Attar, 19, was born and raised in California and trains at Pepperdine University in Malibu, where she is studying art. She has dual nationality because of her Saudi father Amer and chose to represent the Middle Eastern country. The Saudi Olympic Committee overturned a ban on women athletes in June despite strong opposition from many quarters of society. But . officials demanded that all female competitors would be dressed 'to . preserve their dignity' - hence the modest, long-sleeved garments and . hijab covering the hair. It . was reported before the Games that Pepperdine University had been asked . to remove photographs from an online biography of Attar because they . showed her in a tank top and shorts with no hijab. Noor Hussain Al-Malki of Qatar pulled up injured during her 100m heat . Oman's Shinoona Salah Al-Habsi crosses the line in her 100m heat on Friday . In Saudi Arabia, most women cover their heads and faces in public and wear a black cloak called an abaya. She is one of a number of Middle Eastern track athletes who have competed in hijabs at the London Games, including Noor Hussain Al-Malki of Qatar and Shinoona Salah al-Habsi of Oman. There were similar scenes in the Olympic Stadium when the Somalian 400m runner Zamzam Mohamed Farah finished nearly half a minute after the winner in her heat on Friday. Wearing a blue hijab and 'modest' clothing, Farah was applauded by the crowd as she crossed the line.

"Thought to have valuable loot made of copper, silver and gold in its hold . By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 05:15 EST, 9 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:35 EST, 9 August 2012 . A shipwreck discovered in Tonga is thought to be a famous pirate vessel that sank in the 19th century with a hold full of treasure. Legend has it that the Port-au-Prince was attacked by warriors near the South Pacific archipelago in 1806 and most of its British crew massacred on the orders of King Finau 'Ulukalala II. The British had captured the ship from the French and made into a privateer - meaning it had . permission to attack and plunder boats belonging to . rivals Spain and France. Shiver me timbers: The amazing discovery was made close to the Hai'apai islands in the South Pacific archipelago of Tonga . Walking the plank: A privateer similar to the Port-au-Prince targets Spanish ships, as the historic boat did before heading to the Pacific to meet its end . Secrets of the deep: The wreckage was found by two locals reef just off the island of Ha'ano in Ha'apai, in an area renowned for its rough seas . The Tongans salvaged iron and cannon from the ship before the king ordered it to be scuttled [sunk] with its treasure still on board. The vessel was thought to be lost until a local diver in the Ha'apai group of islands found wreckage with features similar to the folkloric ship last month, tourism ministry spokeswoman Sandra Fifita said. If the wreck is indeed the Port-au-Prince, the treasure is likely to still be intact, she added. 'It is believed that a considerable amount of copper, silver and gold is resting with the wreck, along with a number of silver candlesticks, incense pans, crucifixes and chalices,' she said in a statement. Buccaneers' booty: The ship was scuttled with large amounts of copper, silver and gold in its hold after Tongan warriors raided for iron and cannon . Thrilling find: Tongan King Finau 'Ulukalala II ordered his men to massacre most of the British crew, who were aiming to hunt whales migrating through the Pacific . What lies beneath: The wreckage has copper cladding typical of the period and features similar to the famous ship, according to Tonga's tourism ministry . Ms Fifita said the wreck had copper . cladding on the boat's hull, which Britain's National Maritime Museum in . Greenwich dates to 1780-1850, when such cladding was used to protect . against shipworm and marine weeds. The distinction between a privateer and pirate ship is vague, since their work is generally the same - attacking and plundering other vessels. Privateers are given government authorisation, allowing nations to disrupt their enemy's commerce and pressuring rival powers to deploy warships to protect merchant trade against the raiders. At times, the practice has allowed would-be pirates to operate under a veil of legitimacy. The cost was borne by investors hoping to profit from prize money earned from captured treasure, rather than from public money. Britain used privateering as a way to intercept some of the wealth the Spanish and Portuguese were taking from the New World before beginning their own trans-Atlantic settlement, and a way to assert naval power before a strong Royal Navy emerged. Local divers are now mapping the wreck for further study. Resort owner Darren Rice, one of only . two divers to have visited the site, said it was located on a reef just . off the island of Ha'ano in an area renowned for its rough seas. 'There's . very little left of the ship, it's been pounded by four- to five-metre . [13- to 16.5-foot] swells for 200 years, so there's wreckage scattered . all over the sea floor,' he told AFP. Mr Rice was reluctant to reveal too much about the wreck's location, fearing an influx of treasure hunters. 'We want to make sure the area's properly mapped and everything that's found is photographed and documented,' he said. 'If it's the Port-au-Prince then it's the most significant wreck in Tonga's history.' Asked . if he believed there was a lost trove of pirate treasure on the sea . floor, he said that if the ship is the one it is believed to be: 'It's . there.' He added: 'It will be well and truly buried by now and it'll take a lot of work to get to it.' Journey back in time: Local divers from the tropical island paradise are now mapping the wreck for further study . Adventurer's story: Teenage crew member William Mariner survived the massacre and became a favourite of the king, nicknamed Iron Axe, before returning home to tell his tale . Mr Rice said conditions would be too rough for further dives until November or December and the first priority would be trying the verify that the Port-au-Prince's final resting place had been found. 'That's the most exciting thing to me, not the treasure,' he said. 'Only one ship of that era has ever gone missing in Ha'apai, so if it's not the Port-au-Prince, what is it?' The Port-au-Prince was originally built in France but was captured by the British and set sail from London in 1805. After almost two years at sea, during which it raided Madrid's settlements in Peru and plundered Spanish ships, it planned to hunt whales migrating through the Pacific and made its way to Tonga. A teenage crew member named William Mariner survived the massacre, eventually becoming a favourite of the king and adopting the name Toki Ukamea, or Iron Axe. He stayed in Tonga for about four years before travelling back to Britain on a passing ship, recounting his adventures to amateur anthropologist John Martin in An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands. The book remains one of the main sources for historians studying pre-Christian Tonga.","Vessel found in Tonga believed to be the British privateer Port-au-Prince .

Who knew: The American-hating jihadists imprisoned at Gitmo are clamoring for re-runs of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air . Prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are clamoring for a most unlikely diversion from their monotony: Fresh Prince of Bel-Air re-runs. The 90s TV show starring Will Smith has replaced the Harry Potter books and The Cosby Show repeats as the inmates' favorites. And The Hunger Games books are also said to be a firm favourite with prisoners. 'I just ordered all six seasons,' camp librarian Milton told The Miami Herald of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air series in response to many of Guantanamo's 168 detainees' requests for the show. Milton is a U.S. Defense Department contractor who gave only his first name. And while Harry Potter and The Hunger Games were a hit, one  alleged former jihadist who read tweenie vampire thriller Twilight, panned the book, according to his attorney, who spoke with the Florida newspaper.

Earthquake hits Iran killing at least 87 and injuring 600 others as four villages are totally demolished . International terror alert over 'Marie Celeste' boat found bobbing just six miles from nuclear plant . 'He read Twilight, too,' lawyer Wells Dixon reportedly said of his client, a 45-year-old English-speaking Algerian. 'But (he) wasn't a huge fan.' Milton offered no explanation for the sudden popularity of the Fresh Prince saga, which is a  half-hour sitcom about an inner-city Philadelphia kid who moves in with his affluent cousins in California. Gitmo prisoners, like these at Camp Iguana, wile away their time in cell blocks of up to 20 men, equipped with a flat-screen television bolted to the wall inside a plexiglass box. However, he did say that comedies are widely popular among requested items from the detention center’s 28,000-book-and-video library. Prisoners who had formerly gone gaga over British author J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, the saga about a boy wizard who discovers a secret world among 'muggles,' are now going elsewhere for their daily dose of entertainment. 'They’re over that; it’s been more than a year,' the librarian said. A civilian, Milton maintains the . multilingual collection of books that mostly circulate in Arabic, . Pashto, English and French that reach the four Gitmo lock-ups. But the librarian leaves it to the uniformed military to distribute the books, magazines and video material on the cell blocks. It wasn't prison officials who censured the book, Twilight, as one prisoner reportedly didn't like it nearly as much as his mates dug The Cosby Show . Instead he detects trends by demand and noted that before surging interest in Fresh Prince — the show that first aired Sept. 10, 1990 — The Cosby Show had a period of popularity. Cooperative captives, who make up the majority of prisoners, can watch T.V. communally in their medium security lock-ups, pretty much around the clock. The prisoners wile away their time in cell blocks of up to 20 men, which are equipped with a flat-screen television bolted to the wall inside a plexiglass box. Meanwhile, maximum security captives, who represent about 15 per cent of the prisoner population, can watch the show alone for perhaps an hour or two a day. The Herald reports that they get a special solo viewing cell that lets them watch their favored American sitcoms from a recliner, with one ankle shackled to a bolt on the floor. Prison commanders favor activities — like TV, books, art classes and outdoor recreation like soccer — for keeping captives distracted, and reducing friction among them and the guard force, The Herald reports. Detainees are apparently using the material to hone their English, favoring novels that feature side-by-side translation, Milton told the paper. In addition, he said, he has ordered 10 copies of the Oxford English Dictionary, one each for nearly every cellblock. Also, Army Cpt. Jennifer Palmeri told The Herald two hardcover sets of the popular Hunger Games trilogy are in circulation in the detention center this Ramadan. All the versions are in English, she said. In addition, one captive has been furnished with an audio version of Suzanne Collins' three books -- The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Palmeri, a public affairs officer, would not elaborate. So passe: Prisoners who had formerly gone gaga over J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, are now avidly flipping through The Hunger Games .","Detainees at notorious prison clamor for re-runs of the  '90s sitcom starring as well as The Hunger Games .

The team had to quickly lift themselves following the disappointment of defeat to Argentina in Wednesday's semi-final and controlled the first-half without converting any of their chances. The Kiwis struck a post a minute into the second-half but fell behind in the 45th minute when Reading striker Alex Danson deflected in a pass from captain Kate Walsh for her fifth goal of the tournament.

Unemployed Hazell was charged after Tia's body was found in the loft of the home he shares with his partner and Tia's grandmother Christine Sharp on Friday August 10. Hazell is being represented by top barrister Lord Alex Carlile QC, who successfully defended Princess Diana's Butler Paul Burrell and carried out a review of the government's anti-terror laws. He is receiving legal aid for both his QC and a junior counsel. Lord Carlile warned: 'We do not know what the case against this defendant is, there has been some speculation in the media for example about the cause of death but there is no evidence whatsoever, it is no more than speculation. 'It would be dangerous and possibly foolish to to indulge in speculation that may run the risk of prejudicing a fair trial. We have no idea what the issues will be until we have at least the scientific evidence. 'It is also possible there will be a lot of factual background, with some eminating from family members.' But as the trial will be heard by a High Court Judge a trial date in January 2013 was provisionally set. Hazell is expected to enter his pleas at a hearing on November 19.

A man who lit huge bonfires in his garden onto which he threw chunks of plastic to deliberately annoy his neighbours has been found guilty of harrassment. Serial pest Gordon Clarke - who appeared on TV show Neighbours From Hell in 1995 - repeatedly lit fires in his back garden in Crawley, West Sussex, to send toxic smoke all over the neighbourhood. The 52-year-old - who was jailed in 1998 for harassment, in 2001 for breaking a restraining order and again in 2008 - has caused misery to his neighbours John Ferraira, Lara Sanger and Graham Sanger for the last 20 years, Horsham Magistrates Court heard. Neighbour from hell: Gordon Clarke, 52, threw chunks of plastic on to bonfires to send toxic smoke into his neighbours' gardens . Clarke has already received Asbos for offences including singing Queen song ‘Another One Bites The Dust’ after hearing a neighbour had a terminal illness. During the screening of the 1995 documentary about nightmare neighbours Clarke’s wife Jay bragged how she painted her house pink, bought a goat and wanted to buy crowing cockerels ‘just to annoy locals’. Last week, the court heard how Clarke - who has breached his Asbo preventing him from 'harassing and tormenting' his neighbours at least five times since it was handed out in 2006 - had 'not changed his ways'. The court heard how he repeatedly lit bonfires - some which burned for as long as seven hours - to send smelly smoke into neighbouring gardens. During a two day trial, the court heard from neighbour Lara Sanger, who said Clarke’s behaviour left her 'constantly on edge'. She told the court how on August 29 2010 she was reading a book in her bedroom when stinking smoke started wafting in. She said: 'I shut my windows because smoke was going everywhere. I should be allowed to have the windows open on a summer’s day. 'It all seemed to be a deliberate act to cause annoyance and be as much of a nuisance as possible. 'And it was not just going into the immediate neighbours’ gardens, it was going round the whole neighbourhood. There was a blanket of smoke across the gardens.' She told the Crawley News that Clarke lit another bonfire on August 30 and that he then started ‘shouting’ about building a ‘super smoky’ bonfire the next day. She told the court: 'He said he was going to light a bonfire and that it was going to be bigger and he was going to make it as smoky as possible. 'He was doing it loud enough so everyone would hear him.' Neighbour Graham Sanger said at a previous court hearing about living with Clarke as a neighbour for the last 20 years. He told the court: 'It has ruined the quality of life for myself and many other residents. 'I can’t convey just how much of a detrimental effect this is having.' At an earlier hearing at Crawley Magistrates Court prosecutor Kelly Murror said: 'The Asbo is currently in place to prevent the defendant from using words or behaviour to residents and neighbours that are abusive, threatening or insulting. 'The defendant is accused of persistently lighting fires which produced smoke that was foul-smelling. 'He did not just use wood to keep the fire burning - he lit these fires over four successive days. 'It drove neighbours to put a hose pipe over the fence.' Clarke, who was ordered by the council to stop having bonfires in November 2010 and to attend ‘counselling sessions’ to address his behaviour, denied burning plastic, said he only ‘burned wood from trees chopped down in his garden’. He was, however, found guilty of harassment without violence before the case was adjourned for a pre-sentence report.","Gordon Clarke, 52, appeared on TV's Neighbours From Hell in 1995 .

A white Job Centre worker who was branded a ‘n*****-lover’ by a racist colleague and hounded out of her job by 'inept' bosses has won more than £65,000 in compensation. Julie Davies, 41, was targeted with a string of vile taunting notes at the Department of Work and Pensions in Liverpool. A tribunal ruled that Mrs Davies’ managers failed to protect her from her office’s 'toxic atmosphere' and so she had no choice but to resign in April 2011. Mrs Davies said the hate campaign began after she objected to racist . comments about 2010 X Factor stars Gamu Nhengu, left, and Rebecca Ferguson, right . The first note left on her desk was a picture of a golliwog with the typed message: ‘F*** off n*****-lover’. Other offensive messages in later notes included 'N*****-lover bitch f*** off’ and ‘so just f*** off snobby b****’. Mrs . Davies told Liverpool Employment Tribunal that the hate campaign began . after she objected to racist comments about 2010 X Factor stars Rebecca . Ferguson and Gamu Nhengu. The . customer service agent alleged that she overheard one woman who said of . runner-up Rebecca: 'She is quite attractive considering she’s a . n*****.' She accused another female colleague of saying of Zimbabwe-born Gamu: 'They should just send the c*** back.' Mrs Davies, of Liverpool, has a son from a previous marriage and a granddaughter who are Spanish-Arabic origin. Tribunal: Mrs Davies, of Liverpool, pictured, has a son from a previous marriage and a granddaughter who are Spanish-Arabic origin . She took offence when workmate Shirley McIver referred to them as 'coloured'. When she was challenged, Mrs McIver asked: 'Well what shade of black are they?' The tribunal awarded her £65,172 in compensation for race discrimination, harassment, unfair dismissal and victimisation. The payout included £32,000 for lost earnings, £18,000 for hurt feelings and £10,000 aggravated damages. The DWP said it would be taking forward recommendations from the judgement. Announcing the compensation, employment judge Keith Robinson said Mrs Davies’ bosses could easily have transferred her but 'dragged their feet'. They chose not to call in police; refused to allow Mrs Davies to raise a formal grievance; and did not even mount an investigation into who was sending the notes until the third was received. Instead, after her complaint 'vindictive' managers falsely accused Mrs Davies of failing to handle customers properly and she went off sick through stress before resigning. Judge Robinson said: 'This is a most serious case. The respondent is a government body. 'Receiving extremely unpleasant, depressing and upsetting notes was bad enough for the claimant but the inadequate reaction of both middle and senior management to that situation caused much of the damage.' He said that their handling of Mrs Davies’ complaint was 'inept' and ensured they lost a 'valued and valuable employee' who had worked for them for two years. He added: 'This was a woman who had worked hard for the Department and had an exemplary record and was superb at her job.' Mrs Davies broke down in tears as she recalled her ordeal after the X Factor discussions in mid-October 2010. Shortly afterwards, he was sent three notes between October 25 and November 29. She said: 'I am deeply horrified and disgusted at what I have been the subject of.' Judge Keith ruled: 'These were extremely racist and sexist notes in a government workplace. 'The claimant was genuinely and clearly upset, and who wouldn’t be? 'It was clear that something needed to be done to get Mrs Davies out of the nightmare she found herself in but that was not done by the department. 'An investigation was not put into place until after Mrs Davies received the third note.' The tribunal heard that Mrs Davies suffered anxiety and depression from her ordeal but was trying to set up her own business. It ruled that the two particular women Mrs Davies accused of making racist comments about the X Factor contestants were not responsible. The racist who sent the notes has never been identified. A DWP spokesman said: 'The Department is taking forward recommendations from the judgement. 'We are committed to providing services to everyone regardless of their background. As an employer we will not tolerate any discrimination.' The exact location of the DWP offices was not revealed in the case, and the DWP later refused to reveal it. The spokeswoman then said: 'It is not appropriate'.","A tribunal ruled Julie Davies' managers failed to protect her from the office's 'toxic atmosphere'

The city of steel became the city of gold last night as thousands turned out to welcome Jessica Ennis back to Sheffield for the first time since her Olympic triumph. Cheering fans braved heavy downpours as they waited for up to six hours to catch a glimpse of the 26-year-old and see her given the freedom of the city. Miss Ennis, who won Britain’s first Olympic gold medal in the heptathlon for 12 years, was also presented with a golden Walk of Fame plaque. Still smiling: Ennis beams with pride while showing off her Olympic handiwork in front of the crowd in Sheffield city centre . Happy return: Ennis waves a Union Jack with pride in front of her hometown Sheffield crowd this evening . Jess's gold medal brought out the sunshine after fans waited through heavy downpours for a glimpse of her . Council estimates put the homecoming crowd at 10,000 people waiting to greet the heptathlete . It will be set in the pavement outside . the Town Hall alongside the plaques already there of 16 other of the . city's luminaries including Olympics chief and former runner Sebastian . Coe, Monty Python's Michael Palin, novelist Margaret Drabble, singer Joe . Cocker, actor Sean Bean and rock band Def Leppard. The crowd waiting outside City Hall numbered more than 10,000, according to the official council estimate last night. They did their best to fulfil the instruction to wear something gold –  some draped themselves in gold tinsel, while others waved gold balloons or simply wore the most ‘bling’ thing they could find in their wardrobe. One man held up a sign saying, ‘marry me, Jess’. Some sang ‘Jess is coming home’ to the tune of Three Lions. There were Mexican waves. The sun even came out in time for her appearance as the feelgood factor went into overdrive. At last their heroine arrived, wearing skin tight black jeans, a Team GB tracksuit top and wedge shoes, taking time to sign autographs for fans who had waited outside the back entrance to City Hall. A deafening roar went up as she bounded on stage, smiling broadly and holding up her gold medal for all to see, telling them: ‘This is my home and this is the place that I love.’ ‘I literally cannot believe how many people are here,’ she added. ‘It’s such an amazing feeling, to win a gold medal is enough but to have all you people supporting me is something else. I’m literally lost for words … it’s amazing.’ ‘I can’t thank you enough for the support. Thank you so much everyone, if I could thank you all individually I would but there are so many of you.’ Asked what was next for her after her Olympics triumph, she said: ‘It’s hard. I think this is definitely going to be one of the greatest moments of my life and career. ‘I’m going to enjoy every minute before going back into training.’ Yesterday trees and lampposts along the approach to the City Hall where the civic reception was held were wrapped in gold sheets. A red post box had already been painted gold by the Royal Mail in her honour. First to arrive and bag some of the best spots at the front of the stage - at 12.50pm, five hours and 40 minutes before Jessica Ennis was due to appear - were Phoebe Malone, 14, and her brother Joseph, 13, accompanied by their grandmother Mary Malone, 67. 'She's an inspiration,' said Phoebe. 'I do a bit of sport at school but I think I'll have a bit more of a go at athletics after Jess. 'I watched her on the telly at the Olympics and I think she's great.' Ennis's gold in the heptathlon helped . Yorkshire athletes finish with a total of seven gold, two silver and . three bronze medals, placing the county twelfth in the medal table if it . had been competing in its own right. Some . from God's own country, of course as so proud of their county they . think it really should be regarded as an independent country. Many in . the crowd yesterday had homespun theories for why Yorkshire produces so . many top athletes. Marlene . Thompson, 65, a retired nursing assistant from Huddersfield who, said: . 'It must be somat in the water, as they say. Or because you've got to . walk up hills wherever you go here - Sheffield is surrounded by hills.

Flying the flag: The feelgood factor towards Team GB continued in South Yorkshire today ahead of Ennis's appearance . Famous face: A young fan in the large Sheffield crowd shows her admiration for Ennis with a specially-made face mask . Party atmosphere: The feel-good factor continued in Sheffield in ancicipation of Ennis's return, with locals sporting golden crowns and union jacks . Local favourite: Sheffield residents were out in force in the Steel City this afternoon to welcome back golden girl Jessica Ennis . Welcome back: Fans produced their own Ennis banners to commemorate their golden girl's homecoming . 'Yorkshire people have no edge to them. Jess is a proper Yorkshire girl, down to earth and friendly. She is a symbol of all that is good about Yorkshire. She deserves all the luck in the world. This is a big occasion and I wouldn't miss it for the world.' Ennis's popularity is doubtless boosted by being a 'reight bobby dazzler', to use the local dialect, who 'teks a good likeness' (or, for the benefit of Southerners, 'good looking' and 'photogenic'). Lee Carnall, 40, an engineer from Rotherham, who got in the spirit yesterday by wearing a glittery gold wig and a plastic gold medal, said: 'I'm on a big mission. It's my ambition to meet her, but just to see her and her gold medal up close will be enough.' By 'eck! But her legions of fans include plenty of females too. Pride of Britain: Ennis shows off her heptathlon gold medal, which she clinched during Britain's 'Super Saturday' half way through the Olympics . Wearing cardboard Ennis masks, twins . Imogen and Caitlin Parker and their friend Hannah Hills, all aged 15, . danced with excitement and screamed 'Go Jess!' as a video of her . previous achievements, including her world championship success, was . played on a large screen before she arrived.

Sheffield don't end being any good, but she is an inspiration.' Such . is the incredible 'Ennis effect' that Fatmata Jalloh, 28, a college . student, even suggested her two-year-old daughter Kaysho Stephen could . be a contender for the 2028 Olympics. 'She . likes running around. It may just be her age, but what Jess has done . has got me thinking I should look out for what sports she likes doing . and encourage her as much as I can,' said Miss Jalloh, who is originally . from Sierra Leone and has lived in the UK for eight years. 'Times have been tough for people with . the recession, but the Olympics have given everyone a lift and made us . look to the future.' Ennis was first awarded a Sheffield 'Legends' plaque last year for her athletic prowess, and is now the first person . to have hers given a golden hue.

Domnica Cemortan, 25, was working as a passenger rep for Costa Cruises . When the crash happened in January off Italy she was Captain Francesco Schettino's personal guest on the bridge, having earlier dined with him.  Her luggage was found in his cabin. She was interviewed as a witness by the Italian probe into the sinking and has admitted she shared a passionate kiss with him shortly before the disaster. She said she expects she 'would have ended up in bed' with him but for the crash yet strongly denies any culpability for the horror, insisting instead she is a victim who deserves far higher compensation. 'If I sue the company, everyone else who hasn't settled will do the same,' she said hinting at a possible group action among survivors who have not yet accepted the offer. 'It's hard to get anything done in Italy because of the corruption.' She claimed:  'They will drag it on forever - but they will have to listen to my American lawyer.' Captain Francesco Schettino shared a kiss with Domnica Cemortan shortly before the ship crashed . Speaking in Chisinau, the Moldovan capital, she claimed survivors such as her had been offered 10,000 euro as compensation for hardships caused by the crash, plus 3,000 euro for luggage and 1,000 euro for hand luggage, a total of 14,000 euro or around £11,000.

A boy's devout Christian parents have lost their battle to keep him alive after a judge ruled doctors could withdraw life-support treatment despite their plea to leave the decision 'in God's hands'. Mr Justice Ryder said it would be wrong to keep the eight-year-old alive and possibly in pain when there was no hope he would recover from lung failure. He did acknowledge the boy's parents and teenage sister's beliefs during the ruling on Friday, after they told the High Court they were praying for a miracle and were convinced the youngster was still conscious. Ruling: The High Court in London heard that there was no hope the eight-year-old boy would recover from lung failure . Weighing up the benefits and burdens of keeping the boy alive, Mr Justice Ryder said that 'with a heavy heart' he would rule in favour of the hospital's request to stop life-support treatment. The court heard how the boy, who cannot be named, had been born prematurely and had undergone surgery for several holes in the heart when he was just three months old. He went on to live a normal life until June this year when his health deteriorated following surgery to remove a band around his pulmonary artery. He was put onto a life-support machine which took over both his heart and lung function. A month later, doctors saw no improvement in the boy, the court heard.

She added the family were not afraid of the boy dying but did not believe it was down to them or medical staff to decide when his life should end and how it would be a 'betrayal of trust' if they did. The mother said the case had caused the family 'emotional trauma' adding: 'I would . plead that we might be allowed to have days without this threat hanging . over us that we may be able to spend more time with him.' Meanwhile, the boy’s 17-year-old sister said . her brother had told her that it was his faith that had kept him going until now. She added the hospital's decision to switch off her brother's life support had been 'very quick'. Clinicians made their decision to withdraw treatment last week, which prompted the boy's parents to take the hospital's application to court.

Hundreds of barges are today stranded by low water on the Mississippi River near Greenville, Mississippi, after the U.S. Coast Guard closed an 11-mile stretch of the drought-parched waterway for dredging and to replace missing navigation buoys. The worst U.S. drought in 56 years has left the river there at its lowest point since 1988, a year when a similarly dire drought also stalled commercial traffic on the major shipping waterway. A lack of rain in the area in recent months has reduced water levels, exposing sandbars that experts warn could be . deadly quicksand. Scroll down for video . Drought: Some lightly loaded river traffic, such as this set of barges and towboat near Greenville, is still able to move along the Mississippi River. However, 97 vessels were yesterday stranded by low water in the region . Unsafe: A lowering river allowssand bars to emerge in the Mississippi River near Greenville. Experts have warned that these could be deadly quicksand . Waiting it out: Hundreds of barges are stuck north and south of Greenville (left), while the extent of the drought is clearly visible (right) The sandbars that are revealed look . like beaches, inviting boaters, fishermen and hikers to venture out. Experts agree that can be a very bad idea. Steve Barry, emergency management . chief for the Corps of Engineers office in Memphis, Tennessee, said the . exposed sand looks dry on top but it is really saturated mud. Combined . with the undercurrent of water in the fast-moving rivers, that creates a . true danger. Mr Barry said: 'If it's . really wet sand and there's flowing water underneath it, that's what . quicksand is. 'The other issue is that as the river flows . by it undercuts. You think you're on a sandbar but you're basically on a . ledge. You put enough weight on it and you end up in the river.' Dredging operations near St Louis were . halting river traffic for 12 hours at a time on Monday as the U.S. Army . Corps of Engineers worked to keep a shipping lane wide enough and deep . enough for commercial barge tows hauling everything from grain and . fertiliser to steel and coal, industry sources said. Shippers . have been told for weeks to limit the amount of cargo loaded onto . barges by at least 30 per cent so that they sit higher on the water, and . to limit the number of barges in tows, but numerous vessels have still . run aground up and down the river. Vegetation accumulates in the sand bar in the middle of the Mississippi near Greenville. The worst drought in 56 years has left the river at its lowest point since 1988 . Exposed: A low watermark can be seen on the Mississippi River bridge in Greenville . No other option: A barge and its towboat accumulates alongside the bank of the river . At . least three vessels, all with lighter-loaded cargo, ran aground in . recent days between Caruthersville, Missouri, and Memphis, Tennessee, . the Coast Guard said. The . various river shipping restrictions have reduced the flow of goods to . and from Gulf export terminals and driven up the cost of shipping as . cargo volumes have declined but fuel and labour costs have not. Some shipping lines have idled a portion of their barge fleets due to the currently unprofitable freight rates. Jay O'Neil, senior agricultural economist at Kansas State University, . said: 'All of the grain export houses are impacted by the closures on . the river and, when the river is open, by the reduced drafts. It drives . up the costs of delivering grain to the port and it makes logistics a . bit of a nightmare.' Barge . freight rates were only marginally higher yesterday since only minimal . volumes of grain were being shipped to Gulf export terminals. But . the upcoming Midwest corn and soybean harvest could propel freight . costs higher if river traffic remains severely restricted. The . backup at Greenville included 57 southbound vessels and 40 northbound . vessels as of Monday afternoon, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Ryan . Tippets, adding that there was no timetable yet for reopening that . stretch of the river. He said: 'There's a Coast Guard cutter on scene surveying and remarking the channel (with navigation buoys) right now.' Ongoing battle: A winch and a crane keep a dredging apparatus steady as it sucks up sand from the bottom of a navigation channel near Memphis . Water is churned up at the end of a dredging pipeline connected to a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' dredge . Parked up: At least three vessels, all with lighter-loaded cargo, ran aground in recent days between Caruthersville, Missouri, and Memphis, Tennessee . Hold-up: Trucks and their loads accumulate alongside a grain processing operation . The . river was closed on Friday, according to shipping industry sources, . although navigation restrictions have been in place in the area since a . vessel ran aground at the location on August 11. Earlier this month, an 11-year-old . girl had to be rescued after sand swallowed her up to her waist while . she and her family fished along the Mississippi near New Madrid in . southeast Missouri. Firefighter Jim Russell said the girl began to sink . and the more she struggled, the faster she descended. Mr Russell . and another firefighter found a slab of concrete debris to stabilise . themselves, then had to dig the girl out by hand. She was scared but . unharmed. He said: 'When you get to . knee depth, you can't get out. It just starts sucking . you down in it. It's really like heavy goo. It looks dry on top but . really it's waterlogged.' Lt . Ryan Gomez of the U.S. Coast Guard said the best suggestion is to stay . off sandbars.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 17:36 EST, 17 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:15 EST, 17 August 2012 . Killed: A body found in a wooded area has been positively identified as Michaela Shunick, 21 . Court documents detailing the terms of a plea deal in connection to the killing of Louisiana student Mickey Shunick have shed light on the last terrifying moments of the young woman’s life and her fierce struggle against the man who had admitted to murdering her. Brandon Scott Lavergne, 33, a registered sex offender, pleaded guilty on Friday to killing Shunick, 21, and another woman, 35-year-old Lisa Ann Pate, in exchange for a life sentence without parole. He had initially pleaded not guilty, but had a change of heart after the prosecutors said they are going to seek the death penalty. Court documents made public on Friday reveal that Shunick put up a ferocious fight for her life, spraying Lavergne with Mace and stabbing him multiple times before her assailant overpowered  and gunned her down, according to KSLA. Shunick was a senior at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette when she went missing on May 19. She was last seen at around 2am riding her black Schwinn bicycle from the home of a friend. According to a statement made by Lavergne, he spotted the young woman on the bike and intentionally struck her with his pickup truck, sending Shunick flying to the ground. Lavergne insisted that Shunick get into his truck and he put her bike in the bed of his vehicle. When the 21-year-old grabbed her cell phone to call for help, the 33-year-old man pulled a knife on her. That is when the young woman took out a canister of Mace and sprayed her assailant in the face. As the sex offender was trying to get the burning substance out of his eyes, Shunick grabbed the knife from his hands and stabbed him several times, causing what would later be called life-threatening injuries. Lavergne fought back and grabbed hold of his knife, plunging the blade in his victim’s body at least four times, which led him to believe that he killed her. About 40 minutes later, Lavergne drove to a sugar cane field where he planned to dump Shunick’s body when suddenly she came to, jumped up and once again got hold of the knife, stabbing Lavergne in the chest. Scene: The badly decomposed body was found earlier this week next to jewellery and clothing . Grim discovery: Investigators were led to the wooded area in Lafayette by a detailed tip . That is when Lavergne said he pulled . out a semi-automatic handgun he was armed with and shot her once in the . head. She died instantly. After he dressed his wounds, the 33-year-old got . rid of his bloodied clothes and other evidence of the crime. He drove . the 21-year-old’s remains to an area of an old cemetery in Evangeline . Parish intending to bury her, but was unable to because of his injuries, . so he left the body in a nearby wooded area, covering it with branches . and debris. The following day, Lavergne went to . an area off the Whiskey Bay and dumped Shunick’s bike in the river under . the bridge, where it was later discovered. He continued to his friend's home in or around New Orleans, . where he disposed of the handgun used in the murder and threw the knife . in a Dumpster. According to a police report out of . Jefferson Parish, Lavergne was treated for stab wounds at a hospital on . the night of May 19. The report stated that Lavergne couldn't remember . where and how exactly he was attacked. Killer: Brandon Scott Lavergne (left) pleaded guilty to kidnapping and gunning down Mickey Shunick (right) Last seen: The University of Louisiana at Lafayette student had left a friend's house to ride her bicycle home . Deputies said Lavergne told them . someone at a gas station stabbed him with a knife or another sharp . object when he stopped to ask for directions, but was unable to remember . where the alleged attack occurred. Lavergne told police he returned from . New Orleans on May 20. That day, he went back to where he left his . victim’s body and buried her. He went home and burned other evidence, including Shunick’s book bag and iPod. After police released surveillance images showing Lavergne's white pickup . truck, he left Louisiana and drove to neighbouring Texas, where he set . his vehicle on fire. So as not to raise suspicions in his town, Lavergne then went and bought an almost identical truck. Shunick’s body was discovered on . August 7 in Evangeline Parish. Police revealed they were led to her body by a tip, but would not say where it came from. They . followed a private road past a small cemetery of about 30 headstones . and into a wooded area to the spot where the body was buried, ABC News reported.

Happier times: Mickey on the bike that was found dumped under a highway bridge some days later . Lisa Ann Pate was found murdered in September of 1999 . A month earlier, on July 5, Lavergne was arrested during a routine traffic stop because . troopers said he failed to register as a sex offender from a case dating . back to 2000. In that case, he was charged with aggravated oral sexual . battery. He was released in 2008. He . was reportedly on probation until 2010, and is listed as a Tier 3 sex . offender, the most serious classification. Tier 3 offenders must . register with the national sex offender registry for life, according to . the sex offender website. In response to the guilty plea, . Shunick’s sister released a statement: ‘My sister, Mickey Shunick, was a . warrior,’ Charlene ‘Charlie’ Shunick, wrote. ‘If it wasn't for her, our . community never would have been able to bring down a dangerous man that . harmed multiple people.’ Reward: Her friends issued a . $25,000 reward has been issued for any information leading to her . whereabouts .

Mitt Romney has been criticized for being unemotional in the past, but that seems to be behind him as he joined running mate Paul Ryan in welling up with tears during a campaign event in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin on Sunday. 'Tears filled my eyes, tears filled Ann’s eyes. I’m not sure about the kids, but the rest of us felt very emotional,' Romney said after the event in Waukesha, Wisconsin. The rally was held the day after Ryan was announced as Romney's vice presidential pick. Ryan, the 42-year-old Congressman who still lives in his hometown of Janesville, was undoubtedly the most moved by the strong show of support. 'Hi, Mom!' were his first words. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tender moment: Romney shows support of running mate Paul Ryan who appeared overwhelmed by the reception he received at a Waukesha, Wisconsin event on Sunday . Native son: Ryan, who has been a Congressman for his district in Wisconsin for 14 years, joked that his large extended family took up half of the 10,000-strong crowd . Moved to tears: Ryan, seen with his wife Janna and their children Charlie, Liza and Sam, had a warm repartee with the crowd . 'My veins run with cheese, bratwurst, and a little Spotted Cow and some Miller's,' he said of his Wisconsin roots. 'I like to hunt here, I like to fish here, to snowmobile here. I even think ice fishing is interesting. 'I see my family over there — that’s half the stadium. I have lots of family.' The crowd seemed just as thrilled as Ryan was, and were more than happy to bring that familial headcount up. 'We are all brothers,' one fan shouted. Keeping right up with the joke, Ryan replied: 'You're right, we are all brothers. That wasn't my brother who said that, actually.' Bonding already: Since the announcement of Ryan on the ticket, Romney has seemed energetic . Quite a crowd: Ryan has announced that he will be running for re-election for his congressional seat at the same time as the presidential election because his name is already on the ballot . The Waukesha event which had an estimated 10,000 people in attendance took place the same day as Romney and Ryan appeared in their first sit-down interview since they announced their partnership. Ryan made his name in Republican circles due to the major cuts he has suggested for the national budget and proposed Medicare overhauls. While Romney praised Ryan's attempt to 'save Medicare' and called the diligence that Ryan has shown towards budget cuts- which Romney called 'very much needed'- Romney never actually committed to either. Ryan showed that he was in step with Mitt Romney when it comes to the question of tax returns as he said he will only release two years of tax returns- the same amount that Romney has come under fire for releasing. The pair appeared relaxed and notably open-collared during their interview with CBS's Bob Schieffer. When asked how many years of returns he had to present to the Romney camp during their months of secretive talks leading up to his appointment as the vice presidential candidate, Ryan shied away from a clear answer. Happy together: Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney appeared in their first joint interview which aired on CBS on Sunday night, the day after Ryan was publicly added to the ticket . ‘It was a very exhaustive vetting process,’ Ryan said in the interview, adding that it was confidential and therefore he would not be releasing the exact number of years he had to give to the campaign before getting their stamp of approval. ‘I’m going to be releasing two years,’ Ryan confirmed. Though he put the kibosh on the tax releases, that was not the self-proclaimed policy wonk’s last soundbite on their vision for tax policy. Only a portion of the interview was aired on 60 Minutes on Sunday. Kiss for good luck: Paul Ryan gets a kiss from his wife Janna Little Ryan during a campaign event in his home state of Wisconsin on Sunday, the day after his addition to the ticket was announced . Policy wonks: Romney praised Ryan's analytical focus and said that they both enjoyed drafting policy . Both Romney and Ryan talked about how . their vision is one that differs greatly from the picture that . President Obama’s campaign has painted, of how they reportedly plan to . give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans while forgetting about the . less wealthy. Ryan, who at 42-years-old is the same age as one of Romney's son's, has been yet to be seen wearing a tie since he hit the campaign trail formally on Saturday. Romney. 65, has followed suit, taking off his tie in subsequent appearances and analysts have viewed the move as an effort to seem more relaxed and comfortable with his younger partner. In recent months, Romney has been ditching the necktie more often as he has gained ground and become more comfortable campaigning since he was announced as the presumptive Republican nominee. Ryan said that they plan to ‘take away the tax shelters that are uniquely enjoyed by people in the top tax brackets.’ Some political analysts immediately . pointed as potentially pointed as it is thought that Romney’s reluctance . to release more years or tax filings comes because he may have used . such havens to his advantage. Ryan and Romney appeared at ease with one another during the taped interview that aired on CBS Sunday night and it gave the two men a chance to explain how they envision their relationship should they win come November. Highlighting Ryan’s policy experience that comes as a result of his 14 years in Congress, Ryan said that they would be sure to capitalize on said knowledge if they win the election. ‘I anticipate that there will be certain areas that he will take a lead role,’ Romney said. ‘He would also have a role in helping shepherd legislation on the Hill. I can’t imagine not using him and to have his skill’ when dealing with Congress. A complete suit: Internet commentators noted that, during their announcement on Saturday, Ryan wore a jacked with no tie while Romney wore a tie but no jacket . Insider: Romney praised Ryan's prowess in . Washington, saying that 'There are people that may disagree with Paul . Ryan, but I don't know of anyone that doesn't respect his character and . judgement' ‘He has that almost unique capacity to find people of different parties to come together.’ President Obama released a statement . on the selection of Ryan for the ticket that shows that Democrats will . likely attempt to portray the Wisconsin congressman as a far-right . conservative. 'He is a decent man, he is a family . man, he is an articulate spokesman for Governor Romney's vision but it . is a vision that I fundamentally disagree with,' he said in the . statement. While his congressional record will clearly be scoured over the coming weeks and months, what may become an issue for Ryan is the public perception of Congress in general. Though it has come down from its all-time high of 84 per cent disapproval rating, Congress still faces 76.2 per cent disapproval in the latest polls. Campaign: US Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney (R) and US Republican Vice Presidential hopeful Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan (L) speak with media aboard a charter airplane from Sterling, Virginia to Charlotte, North Carolina, on August 11, 2012 . Happy: Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) campaigns with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on August 11, 2012 in Ashland, Virginia . ‘It’s the worst I’ve seen since I've been in Congress in the past 14 years,’ Ryan agreed, though he placed the blame on President Obama saying that Congress is ‘dysfunctional’ because of a lack of leadership from above. ‘President Obama is picking winners and losers based on personal connections,’ Ryan said. ‘What I see is a new amount of crony capitalism.’ The latest national polls still have President Obama at 4.6 per cent ahead of the Romney-Ryan ticket. The pair appears to be on a charm offensive as the younger Ryan- who, at 42-years-old is the same age as one of Romney's son's- seems to have helped bring out the softer side of the Republican presidential nominee. And according to his wife, that has a lot to do with his easy-going disposition. 'You know, he's pretty low-maintenance. Paul is someone who goes with the flow and has one of the sunniest demeanors and most positive outlooks of anyone I've ever met. So I'd say Mitt'll probably have a lot of fun with him,' Janna Little Ryan told People Magazine. WATCH VIDEO HERE .","Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have first interview since VP pick announced .

Get your brollies ready because a bank holiday is coming and that can mean only one thing - rain. That's the warning from forecasters today as the August break looks set to be a washout for some. According to the Met Office, Britain's weather will get increasingly unsettled throughout this week as temperatures cool. What to expect: Demi, nine, and Chelsea Brookes, 11, sit in the rain on Blackpool Beach. Forecasters say this is what's in store for the bank holiday weekend . And by the weekend some area in the . north and west could see thunderstorms and rain moving in from the west - . however the outlook in the south and east is better with a far greater . chance of some sun. Last weekend's searing heat - which saw some areas hit 32C as Britain baked - won't be repeated as across the UK temperatures dip to the low 20s. Met Office forecaster Emma Sharples said: 'As . we go through the week, Wednesday and Thursday will have a higher . chance of a shower and then as we get to the weekend an area of low . pressure in the west which will bring some showers, although there will also be sunshine. 'It is too early and too bold to say it will be a washout but we won't see temperatures as high as . they got this weekend and it will be less humid, less clear and . temperatures in the low to mid 20s. 'It will still feel fairly warm with . temperatures nearer the average for the time of year.'

The sun never came out in West Yorkshire yesterday, instead the region was swept by torrential showers of rain. Here it is raining in Centenary Square, Bradford . However, Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather Services, warned the rest of the month is shaping up to be 'absolutely dreadful'. He said: 'The South-east will hold on to the good weather probably until Wednesday and we will still see some good temperatures across the region. 'But low pressure is due to take over and things are going to really take a dive by the end of the week, and it is looking pretty horrific for the bank holiday – cold, windy and wet. 'Places that have seen the hot­test weather, particularly the East, are in line for some torrential downpours which could cause some flash flooding. It is a real washout for the last official period of summer.' Parts of Britain enjoyed wall-to-wall sunshine and blue skies over the weekend, bringing millions to parks and beaches.

Ally: Ethiopian PM and long-term friend of the West Meles Zenawi has died following a lengthy illness . After two decades in charge of Ethiopia, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has died. The controversial ruler, who became a friend of the U.S. but was also accused of human rights abuses, lost his long battle with an undisclosed disease. The 57-year-old who held a tight grip over the East African country but became a major US counter-terrorism ally, had not been seen in public for around two months, Ethiopian state television said. Meles died just before midnight on Monday after contracting an infection, state TV announced. Hailemariam Desalegn, who was appointed deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs in 2010, is thought to be in charge of the Cabinet. In mid-July, after he did not attend a meeting of heads of state of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, speculation increased that his health problems were serious. Ethiopian officials gave no details and said the prime minister was in 'very good' health and would return to office soon, but international officials said quietly it was unlikely he would recover. Born on May 8, 1955, Meles became president in 1991 and prime minister in 1995, a position that is both the head of the federal government and armed forces. The U.S. has long viewed Meles as a strong security partner and has given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid over the years. U.S. military drones that patrol East Africa - especially over Somalia - are stationed in Ethiopia. But Ethiopia has long been criticised by human rights groups over the government's strict control.

A benefit cheat who pocketed almost £100,000 over ten years by claiming to be wheelchair bound was caught when police found photos of him hula dancing on holiday. Abdul Esfandmozd, 51, lived in a modest flat in Portsmouth and fooled neighbours and officials by travelling around the city in an electric wheelchair. He claimed to be ‘severely disabled’ and incapable of standing or walking without crutches and was supposed to use the cash to pay for carers. Scheming: Abdul Esfandmozd, 51, fooled neighbours and officials by trundling around his home city in an electric chair for ten years . He received the money by claiming to be 'severely disabled' and incapable of standing or walking except with crutches. Instead, he enjoyed regular holidays to America, Cyprus and Malta and invested in property, Portsmouth Crown Court heard. Forms on which he was meant to list carers' names included former England goalkeeper P. Shilton, athlete D. Thompson and even a Mr D. Duck. The huge scam came to light when council officers noticed his paperwork was not in order. He had not submitted receipts for the care work he was supposed to be buying with the £98,730 of payments. Police raided his home and found photographs of him lifting a woman up on a trip abroad, diving into a pool and dancing. There were also six hours of home videos of him filmed on holiday, in which he was shown walking long distances. Esfandmozd, 51, lived an apparently quiet life in a modest flat in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and was supposed to use the cash to pay for carers . Jailing Esfandmozd for four  years, Judge Sarah Munro QC described him as ‘dishonest and manipulative’. But despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Esfandmozd continued to deny his guilt and even remained in his wheelchair throughout the trial. When the verdict was announced, he shouted at the jury: ‘I am innocent, like Jesus on the cross.’ Prosecutor Matthew Lawson said two of Esfandmozd's friends - Jacqueline Taylor and her son Jason Gubb - posed as his carers to help in the fraud. They helped him launder the money and hide his cash from the authorities so that he could continue to receive his benefits. Gubb, 41, put £51,000 through his bank account, which Esfandmozd used to buy his council flat. And Taylor, 65, was found with £70,000 of Esfandmozd's money. Esfandmozd enjoyed regular holidays to America, Cyprus and Malta and invested in property, Portsmouth Crown Court heard . Pictures found in the raid at Esfandmozd's flat showed him and Gubb enjoying a hot air balloon ride in Bristol. Another showed Taylor on holiday with Esfandmozd in Malta. Mr Lawson said: 'The benefits were means tested and not payable to anyone with assets of over £16,000. 'In order to conceal his assets from . the council and ensure that his benefits continued to be paid he entered . into an arrangement with Jason Gubb and Jacqueline Taylor. 'He paid them £22,000 in return for a charge in that sum over their property. 'He . also purchased his property for £51,000 under the right to buy scheme . with the money passing through Gubb's bank account to conceal its . origins. 'You created a false persona, setting yourself up as a wheelchair user with the specific purpose of defrauding the council.' Judge Munro . 'In addition, Abdul Esfandmozd purchased premium bonds in the names of Gubb and Taylor and purchased another house for £70,000 cash.' Judge Munro said: 'Between 2000 and 2010 you consistently and constantly lied to Portsmouth City Council in order to extract benefits to which you are not and have never been entitled. 'You are in my view one of the most dishonest and manipulative individuals ever to have come before this court. 'When it suits you, you can turn on the charm or turn on the tears. If that doesn't work you resort to threats and violence. 'You created a false persona, setting yourself up as a wheelchair user with the specific purpose of defrauding the council.' Esfandmozd, from Portsmouth, was convicted of two counts of fraud and two of obtaining money by deception. He was also convicted of three counts of entering into a money laundering arrangement after a seven-day trial. Gubb, from Bristol, admitted being concerned in the acquisition of criminal property between June 2006 and March 2007. And Taylor, from Bristol, pleaded guilty to being concerned in the acquisition of criminal property between March 2002 and May 2005. She also confessed to a charge of possessing criminal property from April last year. Gubb and Taylor will be sentenced later this month. Esfandmozd will return to court in November when the Crown Prosecution Service will seek to claw back some of the money he claimed. Michael Lawther, solicitor at Portsmouth City Council, said: 'Esfandmozd is a devious and greedy person who cheated the taxpayer. 'The council was responsible for exposing his fraud. Our internal checks raised suspicions about this case and prompted a full investigation into his financial affairs. 'It became clear he was a major fraudster. This case shows that fraudsters like him do not get away with their crimes.' The lengthy investigation began in 2010 and involved the council, the police and the CPS.","Abdul Esfandmozd, 51, from Portsmouth, claimed to be 'severely disabled'

A man with no arms or legs has made history by swimming across four intercontinental channels after losing all four limbs when he was severely electrocuted. French athlete Philippe Croizon finished the final stage of his marathon swim last Friday, swimming the two mile channel in arctic waters between Alaska and Russia in extreme conditions. The 44-year-old, who had never swum before,  is only the second person to swim the Bering Strait. He will now travel to London to be a French commentator at the Paralympic Games. Amputee makes history: Philippe Croizon, right, has swum all four intercontinental channels with swimming partner Arnaud Chausserie, left, after all four limbs were amputated when he was electrocuted . Arriving in Russia along with swimming partner Arnaud Chausserie last Friday, Croizon has now swum all four channels that link the world’s five continents of Oceania, Asia, Europe, Africa, and America. The final leg of their journey, the Bering Strait, was the shortest of their swims but the toughest as they swum through three degree Celsius water, six foot swells and heavy fog. Croizon became a quadruple amputee when he was severely electrocuted by a 20,000 volt charge while he attempted to install a television antenna on his roof in 1994. The burns to his limbs were so bad that they all had to be amputated but after hitting ‘rock bottom’ he was determined to set himself a seemingly impossible task. Toughest swim: While it was the shortest swim, the two mile channel, Bering Strait, was the hardest with arctic waters, six foot swell and heavy fog . Making a splash: Croizon rests on the shore in the coastal village of Pasar Skow located in Indonesia after completing his swim from Oceania to Asia which took seven-and-a-half hours in May . Wetsuit mishap: Croizon swum from Papua New Guinea to Indonesia in a customised wetsuit, pictured, but on the final journey, his specifically designed wetsuit for the arctic water did not fit and he was forced to wear a thin wetsuit in the icy water . Speaking through his translator Marc Gaviard, Croizon said: ‘The idea was to bring able-bodied and people with disabilities together and prove that having a disability doesn't have to stop you achieving what you want. ‘I hit rock bottom after the accident so I wanted to set myself a big challenge and I decided I should hope for the impossible. ‘Whilst we should look at our differences we should also look at our similarities in what we can achieve.’ From America to Asia: The journey from Alaska's Little Diomede Island to the Russian maritime border near Big Diomede Island, measured about two miles and took the swimmer about an hour and 15 minutes . Stranded during storm: The swimming pair were stranded on Little Diomede Island in Alaska for four days while they waited for a storm to pass before completing their remarkable journey . Not long after his accident, Croizon was inspired after watching an American woman swim the English Channel. Using specially adapted artificial legs fitted with giant flippers, Croizon became the first quadruple amputee to cross the 21-mile English Channel in 13.5 hours in 2010. After he crossed the channel he put his elaborate plan to swim all four intercontinental channels into action, dubbed ‘Swimming Beyond Borders’. He arrived in Alaska three weeks ago to adapt to the harsh weather conditions and during the last swim the pair were stranded on Alaska’s Little Diomede Island for four days while they waited for a storm to pass. Croizon also risked getting hypothermia because he had to wear a thin wetsuit after his customised one did not fit properly. He said: ‘The final stage of the challenge in Alaska was the hardest thing I've ever had to do because the weather conditions were so bad so I was very exhausted when we finished. ‘Water is soothing for me and a much better environment for my body compared to being in a wheelchair. ‘I've got no plans for any big challenges in the near future but “never say never” but now I'm going to get some sleep.’ Exhausted but soothing: Croizon said the last swim was the most challenging but that the water is soothing and much better than being in his wheelchair .","Philippe Croizon finished the last of four intercontinental channel swims on Friday .

Mark Chapman is going before the parole board for the seventh time this week and New York Department of Corrections member Linda Foglia has said that the board would make a decision on whether to release Lennon's murderer by Friday . Chapman shot Lennon in December 1980 outside the Manhattan apartment building where the 40-year old former Beatle lived. He was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. Chapman was transferred in May from the Attica Correctional Facility in western New York to the nearby Wende Correctional Facility. Both are maximum security.

Chapman was denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. He was last up for parole in 2010, but this was denied because his 'discretionary release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community,' said the New York State Division of Parole. Chapman is currently being held in protective custody in a single-person cell and is allowed out for three hours each day. Following his transfer from Attica, Chapman applied to participate in a program called 'family reunion' which allows incarcerated inmates to spend more time with their family members.

On his application for parole in 2010, Chapman said that he killed the much-loved musician because he wanted 'instant notoriety.' 'I made a horrible decision to end another human being's life, for reasons of selfishness, and that was my decision at that time,' said Mark David Chapman in 2010. 'I felt that by killing John Lennon I would become somebody, and instead of that I became a murderer and murderers are not somebodies.' Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, in previous years has submitted a letter requesting that parole be denied.

The bodies of Elizabeth Nass and Rose Mayr were found buried under coal but still seated on edge of the bridge, an autopsy found. They were not hit by the train, Howard County police spokeswoman Sherry Llewellyn said. Both were 19-year-old college students. Nass attended James Madison University in Virginia and Mayr was a nursing student at the University of Delaware. Scroll down for video .

The railroad runs across Main Street in Ellicott City, about 13 miles west of Baltimore. A person who answered the telephone at Nass' home declined to comment as did a family member who answered the phone at a number listed for the Mayr family. Two train operators were not harmed. Officials had to use cranes to remove some of the railroad cars. 'Many of those train cars fell onto automobiles, literally fell onto automobiles with the coal,' Howard County Executive Ken Ulman said. 'So you have massive piles of coal and heavy train cars on top of automobiles.' Residents checked to see if their cars or friends' vehicles had been damaged on Tuesday morning. Several grey CSX train cars were still on the bridge while others could be seen derailed farther down the rail line. A number of cars were in a wooded area of the train track that runs along the Patapsco River. Benjamin Noppenberger lives downtown and said he was getting ready for bed when he heard the derailment. He and his wife thought it sounded like gunshots and waited about 10 minutes to go outside. 'We could see all the cars that fell over. I just saw catastrophe,' he said. Jill Farrell, a 35-year-old assistant professor who lives across the street from the tracks, said she heard what sounded liked squealing brakes and then a huge crash. Massive damage: Coal that spilled from the derailed freight train, bottom, partially covers cars in the parking lot below .

Rich history: An official walks past part of the derailed train; The train was passing through historic Ellicott City, around 13 miles outside of Baltimore . 'It actually sounded like trains went off the tracks, and then silence,' she said. The tracks follow the route of the nation's first commercial railroad between Baltimore and Ellicott City, completed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1830. Young people often party in the nearby parking lot and often hang out on the tracks, despite fences around the area. 'It's just sort of a magnet for teenage high jinks,' said Shelly Wygant of the Howard County Historical Society.

Jim Southworth, investigator in charge for the NTSB, declined to speculate on a possible cause. He said the train was going about 25 miles per hour and was equipped with video recording devices that investigators will review to help them determine what happened. Southworth said the train had two locomotives, was 3,000-feet-long and weighed 9,000 tons.About 100 pounds of coal spilled into a tributary of the Patapsco River, a major Maryland waterway that parallels the tracks, said Maryland Department of the Environment spokesman Jay Apperson. He said much more coal lay along the edge of the tributary, raising concerns it could boost the acidity of the water or threaten aquatic life. 'We could see all the cars that fell over. I just . saw catastrophe.' Witness Benjamin Noppenberger . It is not clear if the women died having been hit by the carriages or if they were in the cars when the accident happened around midnight. The NTSB is currently investigating signals, communication, conditions of the track, conditions of the bridge and equipment. They are also determining if 25 miles per hour was the correct speed for that stretch of track, said Southworth. A track expert is flying in from Chicago. Southworth also noted that the train was equipped with video that can provide information in the direction the train was headed. The incident was the second partial derailment this month in Howard County on the railway's Old Main Line .

Lawyers representing clients on legal aid have spoken of their anger after being told they can claim less in expenses if they travel to court by car. The Legal Services Commission, which operates the legal aid scheme, is cutting the mileage rate for cars from 45p a mile to 25p and urging lawyers to use public transport. The move is part of Government attempts to slash £350 million from the annual £2 billion legal aid bill. Lawyers say they were not notified to the changes to the travel expenses system and that carrying confidential files on public transport is impractical . But many lawyers warn it is impractical and dangerous to catch buses while carrying confidential documents. Now lawyers are to make submissions to the Legal Services Commission to get the mileage rates resorted. Charlotte Riley, crown court department manager at Staffordshire law firm Beswicks where 95 per cent of work is legally aided, said: 'We had no notification of these changes. 'The first we knew about it was when claim forms started coming back, saying the LSC would only pay 25 pence per mile. 'Most of the lawyers are out at court every day, so all these claims add up.' She said: 'The mileage rate has been 45 pence a mile for around 15 years - but now, we are being told we have to justify why we haven’t used public transport. 'Carrying all our confidential files to the bus station and then getting on a bus is not practical. 'I haven’t got anything against public transport but we would end up getting on a bus with clients who would want to discuss cases and, in some cases, it could cost more than paying petrol. 'It also wouldn’t go down very well if we were late for court because of delays on buses. And most of the prisons we visit are in the middle of nowhere.' Stuart Muldoon, from Stevens Solicitors, said: 'Our costs have been reduced automatically without any further consideration. 'The LSC isn’t taking into account the distance we have to travel, or where the court or prison is in relation to public transport routes. 'It can take a lot longer to get to places using public transport but this does not seem to have been taken into consideration. 'We are appealing, but all we get is a note back on our claims saying we should use public transport.' The LSC which runs the legal aid network in England and Wales said: 'The approach to assessing mileage claims has been established for many years, and we outlined the payment rates in 2011 and again in May 2012. 'Legal aid is public money, and where public transport can easily be used to get a solicitor to court, it is only fair to the taxpayer to pay the appropriate amount from the public purse.'","The Legal Services Commission, which operates the legal aid scheme, is cutting the mileage rate for cars from 45p a mile to 25p .

A man sentenced to life behind bars for the rape and murder of his wife in 1994 has walked out of prison after newly-analysed DNA evidence has placed another man at the crime scene. After 18 years in prison, John Grega, 50, left the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield, Vermont on Wednesday with bags of his belongings and an enormous grin. The former NASA subcontractor, originally from Long Island, New York, embraced his overjoyed siblings and mother, who had earlier posted $75,000 bail for his release. Walking free: John Grega walks out of the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield, Vermont on Wednesday after a judge vacated his life sentence and ordered a retrial . 'I always said I would walk out,' Grega told the Brattleboro Reformer as he hugged his family and his attorney, Ian Carleton. 'I never gave up. I feel good.' It comes nearly two decades after Grega was convicted of raping and murdering his wife Christine, . 31, while they were on holiday at a West Dover condominium with their . two-year-old son. His lawyers filed a motion last month to have his conviction thrown out in light of newly analysed DNA evidence that appears to show someone else might have been involved in the brutal killing. A hearing was set for Friday but Judge John Wesley shocked the family when, on Tuesday, he said Grega should be freed immediately on bail. Relief: Grega, who has been behind bars for 18 years, was embraced by his mother, siblings and attorney . Happiness: Grega with his brother Anthony Grega and sister Chrissy DiGiancinto. He was freed after tests earlier this year found an unknown male's DNA on his wife's murdered body . It is the first time a conviction has been thrown out under a 2008 Vermont law that allowed convicted . felons to request DNA testing that might not have been available at the . time of their trials. Accused: Grega, pictured in 1995, was found guilty of raping and strangling his wife to death on holiday . Questions remain about how the prosecutors and defense will handle the 18-year-old evidence and witnesses, Carleton told the Banner. 'This is uncharted territory,' Carleton . said. 'We are all trying to get through this first half hour. I’m sure . we’ll figure out what comes next quickly.'

Fewer than five per cent of executives appointed by top companies in the past two years have been female. While Britain’s biggest companies may have heeded calls to end the male dominance of boardrooms, there is a new glass ceiling in place which means women are not getting top executive positions. There are currently only 20 female executive directors employed by Britain's 100 biggest firms, new figures show. Glass ceiling: Women are not getting top executive positions despite Government moves to encourage companies to recruit more senior women . Despite moves by the Government to . encourage large companies to recruit more senior women, only four out of . the 87 chief executives appointed by FTSE 100 companies in the past two . years were female. According to data compiled by BoardWatch, which tracks the appointments of females to UK boards, none of the 18 executives who joined FTSE 100 boards this year has been a woman. The figures could prompt calls for Britain’s biggest companies to face quotas to recruit more women at senior management positions. Listed companies in the share index include Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Vodafone Group, Aviva and Royal Bank of Scotland. Experts said the recent figures show companies are not doing enough to nurture women at an earlier stage of their careers. 6.5% of FTSE 100 executives are women (up from 5.5% in January 2011) 16.7% of FTSE 100 directors are women . 91 board seats needed to hit Lord Davies’ target . 4.6% of executives appointed by FTSE 100 companies in last two years female . 0% of executives who joined FTSE 100 boards this year were women . Jane Scott, UK head of the . Professional Boards Forum, which compiles the BoardWatch data, said the . lack of female executive appointments was ‘great cause for concern’. Ms Scott told The Times: ‘The pipeline in the executive world seems to be broken.' Only . 6.5 per cent of executive directors, such as chief executives and . finance directors, in the FTSE 100 are women, according to recruitment . consultancy Norman Broadbent. This drops to 4.5 per cent in the FTSE . 200, the next tier. The . number of FTSE 100 female executives has increased from 5.6 per cent, the . level before Lord Davies of Abersoch published his Women on Boards . report in February 2011. But while there has been a hike, experts say the increase has been slow. Inspirational: Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts made it to the top of the company. She is one of only four women to run one of Britain's 100 biggest companies . The . last woman appointed to a top management role at a FTSE 100 company was . Tracy Robbins, who was made human resources director of . Intercontinental Hotels Group in August last year, said Neil Holmes, . director at Norman Broadbent, to The Times. And of those companies in the FTSE 250, not a single woman executive has been appointed in the last three months. Lord Davies of Abersoch was appointed by ministers to investigate the lack of women in boardrooms. His report published last year called upon FTSE 100 companies to reach a minimum target of 25 per cent of female representation on the board by 2015. He rejected the option of setting quotas, which exist in countries such as Norway. The listed companies have stepped up their hiring of female non-executives. Since March, a year-on from the release of the report, 24 women have been appointed to FTSE 100 boards and only 20 men. As a result, the overall proportion . of female directors has risen from 12.5 per cent before the Davies report to . 16.7 per cent. Rare: The overall proportion of female directors has risen to 16.7 per cent but the number of female executives being appointed still has a long way to go . In 1999 just 6.9 per cent of directors in the FTSE index of Britain's 100 biggest firms were women. Experts believe that the report’s targets are on track to be met . ahead of the 2015 deadline. However, of nine executives appointed since March, all were male, according to . BoardWatch. Ms Scott told MailOnline: 'We are now seeing a brighter spotlight directed towards the challenge of growing the pipeline of women senior executives and Executive Directors in UK businesses. 'All the companies we talk to are developing strategies to increase the ranks of senior women in their top executive teams as well as looking for gender balance and diversity in the boardroom' Only four of Britain’s 100 biggest companies are run by women, including Angela Ahrendts at Burberry and Dame Marjorie Scardino at Pearson, the education and publishing group. Many companies are trying to address the problem, by introducing flexible working arrangements and insisting that shortlists of potential new appointments feature women candidates. Earlier this year a report by the School of Management at Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, said firms are good at hiring young women to junior jobs, but few make it to the top. Fashion house: Only four of Britain's 100 biggest companies are run by women, including Angela Ahrendts, CEO of Burberry . One female who has made it to the top is chief executive of Burberry, Angela Ahrendts. She is one of the best-rewarded female bosses in the UK thanks to the stellar performance of the luxury group. Burberry, famous for its distinctive red, black and beige check, has been one of the best performers in the FTSE 100 under her leadership. She received a total of £16million last year in pay, bonuses and long-term incentive schemes that bore fruit in 2011. Burberry said that under her leadership the company produced ‘exceptional returns’ for shareholders in a period of economic turbulence. Last year Burberry delivered record revenue and profit, along with job creation in the UK and abroad.","Only four out of 87 chief executives appointed by Britain's 100 biggest firms in past two years were female .

St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly said Saturday that Steven Elliot Johnson had sex with the then-underage teenager. Johnson's mother, 54-year-old Owida Johnson, was charged with two misdemeanor counts of child endangerment. Scroll Down for Video . Owida Johnson, 54, (left) and her son teven Elliot Johnson, 25, have been charged in connection with the alleged sexual abuse and imprisonment of a 19-year-old girl in Washington Park, Illinois . Washington Park Police are about to transfer the mother and son to St Clair County Jail, Illinois . Both are in St. Clair County Jail. Steven Johnson was being held on $2 million bond, his mother on $15,000 . bond. No court date has been set and Kelly said no attorneys have been . appointed. Speaking to The Associated Press, . Kelly wouldn't comment on whether the charges back up the story the . 19-year-old woman told police about being held against her will and . conceiving a son during the first year she allegedly was at the . Washington Park home. The now-2-year-old boy was taken from the home by a police SWAT team Thursday. Kelly said that there were unsafe and . unsanitary conditions in the home, including exposed wiring, spoiled . food in the refrigerator, animal feces in the house and insect and . vermin activity. He said the two counts of child endangerment involve two children, but would not say to whom the other child belonged. Police say the teenager told them she . met the suspect through someone else and that she visited his home . around the time she was reported missing. The man later wouldn't allow . her to go back home to her parents, according to police. According to the teen, the suspect's . mother helped detain her and helped falsify medical records, police say. The teen told investigators the man and his mother coerced her into . using a false name when giving birth to conceal that she was underage, . according to police. Saved: The teenager's baby is carried away by the SWAT team after it was rescued from the home in Illinois . The young woman has told police she . repeatedly tried to escape the house, which is on Washington Park's . busiest street and next door to a convenience store, just a half mile . from a freeway. But her captor chased her down each time and forced her . back to the home at gunpoint, according to police. Steven Johnson faces a separate . felony charge of promotion of prostitution. Kelly would not say if that . was related to the teenager. Johnson also faces two felony drug . charges and a felony gun charge. Combined, his charges would bring a . maximum sentence of 30 years. Kelly would not comment on the possibility of other charges, saying only that the investigation is ongoing. Washington Park is a village of 4,200 . people tucked on the edge of East St. Louis in one of Illinois' poorest . regions. Known for its strip clubs and poverty, the community has . grappled for years with corruption and violent crime punctuated by the . 2010 shooting death of the village's mayor, John Thornton. The village twice has filed for bankruptcy since 2004, the last time in 2009. The teenager held . as a captive sex slave in a house for more than three years before . escaping with a relative's help initially went there voluntarily but . wasn't allowed to leave when she wanted to go home, an Illinois police . chief said on Friday. Horrific abuse: The teenager told police she escaped her daily torment earlier this week with a relative's help . Washington . Park Police Chief David Clark said the 19-year-old St. Louis woman . bolted from the home on Monday and told investigators her time in . captivity included almost daily beatings and sexual assaults. One . of those attacks resulted in a now-2-year-old boy rescued when a police . SWAT team raided the home next to a gas station on Thursday and . arrested a 25-year-old man and his mother, Clark said. According to Washington Park police, the woman claims she was held . against her will for more than 2 years as a sex slave at the house on . Kingshighway by the 25-year-old man and his family. A boy, aged 16, was also removed from the home in his school uniform, according to BND.com. The police chief said the three days between the teen's report and the raid on the home was largely spent substantiating her story. Clark also said investigators were working a separate sexual-assault case and lacked the manpower to go any faster. No charges have been filed in the case. Clark wouldn't publicly identify the suspect - originally reported as 17-years old - his mother or the teenager, citing the ongoing investigation. He said investigators planned to have the child's DNA tested to determine whether the man is his father. St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly, the county's top prosecutor, told The Associated Press on Friday that conditions in the home were 'definitely deplorable.' Initial evidence suggests that 'some of the details are consistent with what the young lady is saying, and I think there's something to it.' he said. 'We're still trying to figure out what the heck is going on.' Hideaway: A man passes outside the home where the 19-year-old St. Louis woman claims she was held captive for more than three years before managing to escape on Monday . Aided kidnapping: The young woman told police that the mother of the 25-year-old man arrested helped her falsify her name during child birth two years ago to prevent her rescue . Baby: A baby stroller rests alongside the home where the young woman claims having given birth to her kidnapper's child . Clark said the teenager met the man socially 'through someone else when they were partying, and a relationship built,' eventually leading to her visit of his home about the time she was reported missing. 'When she (soon) decided to go back to her parents, he wouldn't allow it,' Clark said. She was listed as a missing . or runaway juvenile on April 6, 2010 in St Louis, Missouri, close to . the state line. She was 15 years old when she disappeared. He said the man's mother helped detain the young woman and helped falsify medical records when she bore her son in the first year of her captivity. The teen told investigators the man and his mother coerced her into using a false name when giving birth to conceal that she was under-aged, Clark said. The young woman has told police she repeatedly tried to escape the house, which is on Washington Park's busiest street and next door to a convenience store, just a half mile from a freeway. But her captor chased her down each time and forced her back to the home at gunpoint, Clark said. Conditions: The home was described by police to have been in deplorable conditions, with six mattresses seen stacked in its backyard .

The village twice has filed for bankruptcy since 2004, the last time in 2009. Neighbors told The Associated Press they had little reason to suspect anything amiss at the bungalow on a parcel cluttered with trash, including a stack of six mildewing mattresses on a concrete slab surrounded by tall weeds. A child's car seat, baby stroller and car tires were nearby. A neighbor, Lakeitha Smith, opened her front door a crack and told the AP that during the few times she saw the young woman outside, the teenager didn't appear bruised or traumatized. Smith said the man would step away from the home at times with the toddler, who 'looked like a healthy baby,' and often came to Smith's house, where he played with her 3-year-old son.

However the police chief said witnesses have not confirmed Tennen's account that he attacked after being asked if he was Jewish at a party close to Michigan State University campus. Detectives also have no evidence that Tennen's mouth was stapled during the attack as he claimed.

East Lansing police did not return further calls from MailOnline today. Earlier this week, Zach Tennen said he was set upon by two men who asked if he was Jewish. The attackers, who claimed to be Ku Klux Klan, then raised their arms in a Nazi salute, saying 'Heil Hitler' and began hitting the teenager. Zach said that while he was passed out, the attackers managed to staple through his gums. He said: 'It was coming up in my two bottom teeth and it started in my gum, so, somehow they managed to staple it.' Vicious assault: Zach Tennen, 19, was recovering at home near Detroit, after he was beaten by two men in an apparent anti-Semitic attack . Violent: Zach indicates where he woke up to find he had a staple in his mouth after being attacked on Sunday . His mother told the Detroit Free Press that around 20 people at the party watched the attack but no one helped her son. He was then thrown out of the party. The teenager also has a broken jaw below his bottom teeth which required being set with wire. His family contacted the Anti-Defamation League, an organization which fights anti-Semitism, on account of the assault. In a statement to MailOnline, ADL Detroit Regional Director Betsy Kellman said: 'We . are horrified by this violent assault and allegations that the student . may have been viciously attacked because he was Jewish.

Zach, who graduated from Birmingham Groves High School last year and studies journalism at MSU, said he had drank alcohol at the party but only a small amount. After his attackers fled, he called a cab to take him to Lansing Sparrow Hospital. The hospital did not call the police but said that it was standard policy to alert authorities if someone reported being a victim of assault. Zach later had surgery at a Detroit hospital to have his jaw wired shut. Brutal: Zach Tennen said the men who assaulted him asked if he was Jewish and then made Nazi signs .

Emaciated and riddled with fleas, this is how two German Shepherd dogs looked when they were taken into care. RSPCA inspectors found the white dogs, named Sapphire and Sammy, had lived in a home smelling of urine and ammonia. They also found a cat called Tigger which, while not as starved as the dogs, was also thin and infested with fleas. Neglected: One of the starved German Shepherd dogs that lived in a home smelling of urine and ammonia in Carlisle, Cumbria . Poor condition: RSPCA found the German Shepherd dogs to be underweight and infested with fleas . The pets' owners, Colin Chester and Kirsty Kendall, have been banned from keeping animals after they were convicted in court of failing to meet their needs. An investigation began after Chester, 35, and Kendall, 22, of Carlisle, Cumbria, contacted German Shepherd rescue charity Second Chance to ask it to take a dog. When the couple handed over Sapphire, a bitch believed to be less than a year old, charity workers were so concerned by the animal's condition that they took it to a vet and alerted the RSPCA. Inspector Chris Towler, from the RSPCA's Cumbria and North Lancashire branch, went to the couple's home with police and was alarmed by what he found. 'We found a further dog in the premises,' he said. 'It was an adult female, white German Shepherd by the name of Sammy. 'This dog was also emaciated and running with fleas and the property smelled of urine and ammonia.'Tigger the cat was also in a poor condition. All three pets have since been rehomed. Suffering: The pets' owners, Colin Chester and Kirsty Kendall, have been banned from keeping animals after they were convicted in court of failing to meet their needs . Chester appeared at Carlisle Magistrates’ Court on July 13, where he pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to meet the needs of the three animals, and one charge of causing suffering to the two dogs due to their emaciated condition. He was banned from keeping animals for five years and was ordered to complete 210 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £500 towards the RSPCA’s prosecution costs. Kendall denied the same allegations, but was later convicted at the same court. She was banned from keeping animals, given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £300 towards the RSPCA's costs. Mr Towler said: 'Throughout the case, lack of finance was clearly an issue. 'While I appreciate that in these times everybody’s tight with money, there are plenty of assisting charities out there who could have helped to prevent this matter and the ultimate suffering of the animals concerned.' Mr Towler praised Second Chance for their initial action, and for their subsequent help in fostering and then rehoming all three pets. 'It has been a good outcome for all three animals and I hope Mr Chester and Miss Kendall think very hard about what they have done,' he added.

It said ‘obstructive’ or ‘combustible’ items - including doormats as well as picture frames - were banned from communal areas because they could potentially pose a fire hazard. The letter, signed by neighbourhood housing officer Abbie Booth, said Stockport Homes was prepared to allow just two pictures in the entire ground floor corridor - one on each side of the hallway. The letter warns anyone who fails to do so will be in breach of their tenancy agreement. Resident Stewart Edge, 64, said he and his neighbours had been ‘gobsmacked’ by the warning.

I think what these people have done is disgusting - but some people don't have any morals, do they? 'If it was for someone else's child we'd feel exactly the same. We had a brilliant event on Saturday and I'm gutted that one or two people have let everyone down like this. 'It was never really our money - I just feel sorry for all those people who donated.' The couple, from Yate, near Bristol, held a pub treasure hunt, auction and a karaoke event to raise money for their Corin's First Steps appeal. Corin was diagnosed with cerebral . palsy when he was 18-months-old and cannot walk unaided and relies on a . walking frame or wheelchair to get around. The charity is trying to find £35,000 . for the brave little boy to have a life-changing operation to help him . walk, plus vital aftercare. They . hope Corin will be able to have the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery . (SDR) that is offered at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. Cash . from their charity fundraiser was stored at the Shireway Community . Centre in Yate - but two thieves forced their way in at 2.15am on August . 20. This CCTV shows the moment two heartless thieves stole £1,400 from a charity saving for an operation to help three-year-old Corin walk . Cashing in: The heartless duo broke into Shireway Community Centre in Yate and stole about £1,400 collected for the Corin's First Steps appeal . The pair, dressed in hooded tops to . conceal their faces, cracked open a safe and took more than £8,000 in . cash - including £1,400 towards Corin's appeal. Support . worker Miss Weeks, who gve birth to her second child, Inaya, 11 weeks . ago, said: 'We believe the thieves might have known the money was there. 'It is horrible to think that they . might have been at our charity event on the Saturday, then took the . money from Corin two days later. 'This operation is really important for Corin's quality of life and it is vital for his future that he has it.' Corin's . operation will cut some of the nerves in the spinal cord to overcome . the tightening of muscles that makes it difficult for people with some . forms of cerebral palsy to walk. While . surgery is available at Frenchay Hospital, seven miles away from the . family's home, it is not routinely available on the NHS and local health . trusts do not tend to pay for it. The family have been told it is . unlikely they will get funding and they are waiting to find out whether . Corin will be able to have the procedure at Frenchay for about £23,000. If not, they will have to go to the USA - where it would cost considerably more. Corin Potts, pictured here when he was just a couple of hours old, relies on a walking frame or wheelchair to get around . The community has been left sickened after the pair forced the safe open and made off the with the life-changing money . The couple, who have raised £28,000 for Corin's operation through their appeal, were delighted when another Bristol charity stepped in to replace the stolen cash. Scott Wright, who runs a charity helping children and families effected by cerebral palsy, and his fiancee Melissa, heard what had happened and felt compelled to help out. He said: 'When I saw the story it made me sick to the stomach. It almost felt personal because my brother has the same condition. 'I cannot imagine what it felt like to put in all the effort and raise all that money, only for some vile toe-rags to steal it.' Police are still hunting the pair responsible for the cruel raid. Neighbourhood Insp Andy Workman, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'The community has really pulled together to raise this cash for Corin and his family. 'I am sure anyone with information about who is responsible for taking this money and causing so much damage to a valued community centre will come forward to help.'","Thieves forced their way into safe hours after family held fundraising events .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 13:28 EST, 30 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:59 EST, 30 August 2012 . Two Missouri farmers who became seriously ill after being bitten by ticks were found to have contracted a new type of disease dubbed the ‘Heartland virus,’ according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both patients were admitted to hospitals after experiencing high fevers, fatigue, diarrhea and loss of appetite. Although their blood count was low, the patients did not suffer abnormal bleeding. They were initially thought to be suffering from a bacterial infection, but that diagnosis was found to be incorrect when their condition didn't improve after being treated with antibiotics. All in the family: The newly identified 'heartland virus' belongs to the phlebovirus family, which has about 70 members - many of them insect-borne . Further tests revealed the men’s blood contained a new kind virus. The bug belongs to the  phlebovirus family which contains about 70 members, many of them carried by flies, mosquitoes or ticks, and can cause disease in humans, Discovery News reported. Hantavirus, spread by deer mice, comes from the same group, and so does the deadly Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Laura McMullan, a senior scientist at the CDC who co-authored the study, said that while the genetic material of 'Heartland virus' appears similar to that of other phleboviruses, the particular proteins it produces are different enough to call it a new species. The new virus' closest relative is another tick-borne phlebovirus, called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus, which was identified last year in China, and causes death in 12 per cent of cases. Possible culprit: Researchers believe Amblyomma americanum, or Lone Star tick, may be one of the hosts of the 'Heartland virus' Another possible relative may be Bhanja virus, a rare condition that has been found in some mammals, birds and reptiles in Asia, Africa and Europe. According to the study published in the August 30 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, a species commonly found in Missouri called Amblyomma americanum, or Lone Star tick, may be one of the hosts of 'Heartland virus.' McMullan said more studies are needed to identify the insects carrying the disease, learn how many people contract it and find risk factors for infection. Because the 'Heartland virus' causes such general symptoms, it could be ‘a more common cause of human illness than is currently recognized,’ the researchers wrote. In 2009, Robert Wonderly, then-57 year old, of Sheridan, Missouri, and a 67-year-old man also living in northwestern Missouri had reported tick bites, NBC reported. Wonderly said his wife plucked a single insect off his abdomen with tweezers, while the other patient said he must have been bitten about 20 times a day for two weeks while rebuilding fences on his property. Epicenter: One of the two patients who contracted the rare illness was bitten by a single tick in his hometown of Sheridan, Missouri . ‘I was getting worse and worse,’ Wonderly, now 60, recalled. The men had all the symptoms of ehrlichiosis, a relatively common but potentially dangerous tick-borne infection. But when scientists looked at the farmers’ blood samples under the microscope, the bacteria was nowhere to be found, leading them to believe that they were onto something new. ‘This particular virus has never been detected before,’ said Dr William L. Nicholson, a research microbiologist who specializes in emerging and zoonotic infectious with the CDC. ‘This is unique to the world.’ The TV station Fox23 reported that the first patient, Wonderly, spent 10 days in the hospital. Two years later, he is still feeling tired and often suffers from headaches. Initially, he had memory problems and loss of appetite, both of which slowly improved. The second patient, who has not been named, was in the hospital for 12 days. Over the next weeks, he too suffered from memory problems, fatigue, and loss of appetite, but the symptoms eventually went away. Dangerous cousin: The new virus' closest relative is another tick-borne phlebovirus, called SFTS virus, which was identified last year in China . The illness was given the moniker the ‘Heartland virus’ in honor of Heartland Regional Medical Center in St. Joseph, Missouri, where the patients were treated, and also because it was discovered in a region commonly known as the nation’s heartland. So far, scientists believe that the two farmers are the only people in the world to have contracted the bug, but they are sure there are more cases out there. While researchers are working to learn more about the new virus, the CDC recommends using repellents that contain 20 per cent or more DEET to prevent tick bites, as well as avoiding wooded areas or areas with high grass. The agency lists 10 tick-borne diseases in the U.S., including Lyme disease, which infected about 30,000 Americans in 2010, as well as anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, which affect about 1,000 people each a year.","New virus belongs to the phlebovirus family which contains about 70 members .

Hearing: Abdullah Khan, 37, denied ignoring her cries for help and failing to notice she had been seriously injured . A 97-year-old woman was left crying out in agony after she broke her neck at a BUPA care home and was given just two paracetamol tablets, a hearing was told. The pensioner was left in her bed for nearly two hours before an ambulance was called. Abdullah Khan, 37, denied ignoring her cries for help and failing to notice she had been seriously injured. The hearing also heard how he did not call an . ambulance to . avoid ‘whingeing’ paramedics. But giving evidence he told the . Nursing and Midwifery Council he did not call an ambulance because he . could not be ‘100 per cent sure’ what was wrong with her. After . a ten minute assessment, he gave the woman two painkillers following . the 6am fall and did not bother to check on her again before his shift . ended at 7.30am, it was alleged. The woman fell in her room at the BUPA-run Old Gates Nursing Home in Feniscowles, Blackburn, Lancashire, on March 20 last year. Senior carer Wendy Aspen took over from Mr . Khan at 7.30am, and an ambulance was called shortly afterwards when the woman's condition was discovered. Lucinda Bernett, chairing the NMC hearing, said: 'Mr . Khan stated he did not want to call an ambulance if he was not 100 per . cent certain as to the need, since the ambulance staff would be . ‘whingeing and upset’ if they were called unnecessarily. ‘As . a registered nurse and the senior member of staff on duty at the time, . it was Mr Khan’s responsibility to call an ambulance. ‘He did not do so. ‘That omission is, in the panel’s judgement, a culpable failure.’ Khan was today found guilty of five failures in the care of patient A before she was eventually taken to hospital. His . evidence was criticised as inconsistent, at times contradicting his . notes made at the time of the incident and some of his own testimony to . the hearing. ‘According to Mr Khan, patient A was mobilising her arms and legs but could not say whether she was in pain’, said Ms Bernett. ‘He recorded that patient A was complaining of ‘pain in neck’. ‘This directly contradicts his oral evidence that she was not able to say whether she was in pain.’ Care . assistant Zulekha Namaji had told the panel resident A was ‘screaming in . pain’ and holding her neck, but Mr Khan had dismissed her concerns . saying: ‘She doesn’t need to go, there’s nothing broken.’ ‘She hadn’t any injuries, no bleeding or swelling, and she was just sat on the commode not saying anything to me’, Mr Khan said. ‘I couldn’t be sure if she was OK or . not, but she was saying she wanted to get up and go to bed. At the time I . saw her she was not crying and I did not see her in pain. ‘If there was any pain, there is no problem to send to hospital, but at the time I saw her she was not crying.’ Khan gave patient A two paracetamol tablets, but was found guilty of failing to document this properly. He . was further found guilty of failing to complete paperwork following the . fall, and claimed he had asked care assistants to do it for him. ‘Mr . Khan had an independent duty, in accordance with his responsibility as a . registered nurse, to record assessments made, treatments administered . and medicines given and could not delegate those responsibilities to a . third party.’ The panel . also decided Khan had failed to give an adequate handover at the end of . his shift, further delaying the calling of an ambulance for patient A.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:08 EST, 29 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:16 EST, 29 August 2012 . France's Hollande has promised to wage war on unemployment . The French government is offering to pay most of the salaries of tens of thousands of young people hired next year, as part of President Francois Hollande's promise to wage war on unemployment. France's unemployment rate is 10 per cent, but 22.8 per cent for those under 25 - an imbalance that many European countries are struggling with. French employers are especially reluctant to hire young people because restrictive labour laws make it very hard for companies to lay off employees. In addition, many industries require a series of often unpaid internships before landing a full-time job or only offer very short-term contracts for those just starting out. Under the plan, unveiled at a cabinet meeting Wednesday, companies that hire a person between 16 and 25 for at least a year will only have to pay as little as 25 per cent of the salary. The government hopes to create 100,000 of these 'contracts for the future' next year and another 50,000 in 2014. It has promised to continue paying its share of the employee's salary for three years. 'We are waging a battle for jobs,' Hollande told cabinet ministers, according to government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem. 'It's the No. 1 challenge of our mandate.' The government will give preference to . young people hired from poor urban or rural areas that have been hit . hardest by rising unemployment. Attempts by previous governments to tackle surging youth unemployment have sparked protests like the one pictured above in Marseille in 2006 . Certain sectors will also be favoured, such as medicine and digital or green technology. The proposal needs to make its way through parliament, but Hollande's Socialist Party has a solid majority there and the issue was a major campaign promise. Hollande has staked his credibility on driving down unemployment and encouraging growth, all while meeting strict budget deficit targets. It's unclear whether he can manage all three - especially since the economy's fate is largely tied up with Europe's wider debt crisis and the wellbeing of its neighbours. An entrepreneur's association immediately panned the idea. 'The jobs for the future are only a Band-Aid, if a necessary Band-Aid, in the face of a government that every day shows itself more incapable of overcoming the difficulties our country is confronted with,' said Guillaume Cairou, president of the Club of Entrepreneurs and CEO of strategy consultancy DIDAXIS. 'How can they not see that this cost is extremely high for the government, even while we should be reducing our deficit?' The government estimates that the programme will cost 2.3 billion euros (£1.8 billion) next year. While France has so far dodged investor concerns that have driven borrowing costs high in Spain and Italy, many economists say its day is coming. While the sheer size of its economy - the eurozone's second-largest - has insulated it, they insist that its declining competitiveness will eventually force it to make the kinds of tough reforms its neighbours are facing.","French premier vows to reverse 10% unemployment .

Resignation: Suzanne Barr resigned today amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior lodged by at least three Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees . A senior Obama administration political appointee and longtime aide to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano resigned Saturday amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior lodged by at least three Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees. Suzanne Barr, chief of staff to ICE Director John Morton, said in her resignation letter that the allegations against her are 'unfounded.' But she said she was stepping down anyway to end distractions within the agency. ICE, a division of the Homeland Security Department, confirmed Barr had resigned. The Associated Press obtained a copy of Barr's letter. Barr is accused of sexually inappropriate behavior toward employees. The complaints are related to a sexual discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by a senior ICE agent in May . In her letter to Morton, Barr said she has been the subject of 'unfounded allegations designed to destroy my reputation' and is resigning 'with great regret.' 'Of greater concern however, is the threat these allegations represent to the reputation of this agency and the men and women who proudly serve their country by advancing ICE's mission,' Barr wrote. Former boss: Barr had been chief of staff for John Morton, pictured, the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . 'As such, I feel it is incumbent upon me to take every step necessary to prevent further harm to the agency and to prevent this from further distracting from our critical work.' Barr went on leave last month after the New York Post reported on the lawsuit filed by James T. Hayes Jr., ICE's special agent in charge in New York. Additional employees came forward with their allegations around the same time. In one complaint, Barr is accused of telling a male subordinate he was 'sexy' and asking a personal question about his anatomy during an office party. In a separate complaint, she is accused of offering to perform a sex act with a male subordinate during a business trip in Bogota, Colombia. She's also accused of calling a male subordinate from her hotel room and offering to perform a sex act. The names of two of Barr's accusers were censored in affidavits reviewed by AP. Homeland Security's office of professional responsibility and inspector general have been investigating the allegations. Prior to the lawsuit, there were no complaints about Barr, according to a homeland security official who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Denial: The suit does not outline the nature of the relationship. Napolitano, pictured, has denied she is gay . In the lawsuit, Hayes described a 'frat house' atmosphere at ICE designed to humiliate male employees under Barr's leadership. James T Hayes Jr, the head of the New York ICE office, filed a discrimination lawsuit against Napolitano earlier this year. The latest affidavits have been submitted to his attorney . Hayes, who was transferred to New York from ICE headquarters in Washington, is asking for more than $4million that, among other things, would cover compensation he believes he is owed for relocation expenses and financial losses associated with his transfer. Hayes' lawyer, Morris Fischer of Silver Spring, Maryland, has declined to comment. The Justice Department is seeking to dismiss Hayes' lawsuit on the basis that he did not state a claim for retaliation. Barr, a 1995 graduate of the University of Arizona, was among Napolitano's first appointments after she became secretary in 2009. Barr started working for Napolitano in 2004, while Napolitano was governor of Arizona. Prior to that, Barr worked for Arizona Republican Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain. In one of the new affidavits, an ICE employee claims Barr said to a senior executive, 'You a sexy m*****-f*****'. It continued: 'She then looked at his crotch and asked, ""How long is it anyway?"" Several employees laughed nervously.' The other witness statement details a . trip to Colombia in late 2009 made by Barr, ICE director John Morton . and Ray Parmer, ICE special agent in charge of Homeland Security .

The affadavit said: 'During this party, Suzanne Barr approached me and offered to' perform a sex act.

Britain's former ambassador to Afghanistan yesterday spoke of his ‘heartbreak’ at the sight of wounded soldiers taking part in the Paralympic Games’ opening ceremony. Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles accused the Government of ‘betraying’ those who served in Afghanistan, because its plan to pull out troops in 2014 would hand large parts of the country to the Taliban. He said it was painful to watch the soldiers bear their horrific injuries so bravely. Hero: Marine Joe Townsend, who lost both legs in Afghanistan, carries the torch into the Olympic Stadium . Eight wounded servicemen and women are in Britain’s Paralympic team, and several others were involved in the torch relay. Sir Sherard, who was Britain’s ambassador in Kabul until June 2010, said that he had been particularly moved by the high-profile involvement of Captain Harry Parker and Marine Joe Townsend, who both lost both legs in separate bomb blasts in Afghanistan. He said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘What breaks my heart is when I saw Captain Harry Parker running down Whitehall carrying the Olympic flame last night and Marine Joe Townsend going into the Olympic stadium also carrying the torch. ‘We are betraying them because we – the diplomats, the politicians, the civil servants – have failed to accompany a perfectly sensible military tactical campaign with a serious political strategy.’ Sir Sherard said politicians on both sides of the Atlantic had failed to use the results of the military effort to develop a lasting peace process in Afghanistan. Heartbreaking: Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles said it was painful to watch wounded soldiers taking part in the spectacular show . He said there was a real danger that the fragile gains made in the country would quickly evaporate when British and American troops leave in 2014. He added: ‘What we are doing, . essentially, is cultivating an allotment in a jungle, and the question . is what happens when the gardeners leave?’ Sir . Sherard said that al Qaeda had been ‘virtually eliminated’ in . Afghanistan but that politicians had failed to invest the will and . resources needed to ‘finish the job’. He . said British troops had done a superb job, but added: ‘We’re in danger . of betraying their legacy, betraying their courage, unless the . politicians, the diplomats, do their job, which is to broker a serious . solution inside Afghanistan and involving all the countries of the . region.’ Barack Obama and David Cameron have both committed to withdrawing all combat troops from Afghanistan by 2014. Critics, . including some in the military, accuse the two leaders of acting for . domestic political purposes and warn that premature withdrawal from . Afghanistan will hand control over large parts of the country to the . Taliban. 'Betrayed': Discus thrower Derek Derenalagi lost both legs when his armoured vehicle hit an improvised device while on patrol in Afghanistan in 2007 . Athlete: Volleyball player Netra Rana sustained serious back and leg injuries in a blast in Afghanistan in 2008 . Sir Sherard called on the US to broker talks with all the main parties in Afghanistan, including the Taliban, along with talks involving the country’s neighbours, particularly Pakistan. But he conceded this was unlikely ahead of November’s US elections as there were ‘no votes in being portrayed talking to the Taliban’. Ministers insist that by 2014 the Afghan security forces will be fully trained and capable of dealing with the Taliban by themselves. But Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, also yesterday accused politicians of failing to match the commitment of the troops. He said that soldiers did not talk of ‘betrayal’, but added: ‘I think there have been some very serious shortcomings politically.’ Colonel Kemp said the West had failed to prevent the Afghan government sliding into the ‘depths of corruption’. And he said it was extraordinary that Pakistan had been allowed to supply ‘such strong levels of support to the Taliban’.

It . was a joint decision, we had been to weddings before and they were all . very serious and I felt quite uncomfortable and I didn't want to feel . like that on our day. 'I wanted a relaxed atmosphere, and . we both love the Beatles, so it made sense, and our first date was . Beatles-themed. It was a common interest and something we both liked and . it brought us together.' Mark and Rebecca's wedding cake was based on the Beatle's 1969 album Abbey Road, which features the iconic shot of the Fab Four walking over a northwest London zebra crossing . The band's iconic 1969 Abbey Road album cover, upon which the Wright's wedding cake was based. Rebecca explained: 'When I first met up with Mark in Liverpool we went on a trip to find all the Beatles places, like Penny Lane. 'So . Mark and his three friends dressed up in the Sergeant Pepper Beatles . outfits, and then four of our friends dressed up in their earlier . costumes of grey suits and wigs.' She added: We had all of our tables named after Beatles' albums and we had a band that played some of their hits. 'Everyone made a huge effort and was dressed up - it was fantastic and brilliant fun.' 'When . the guests were coming in we had 60s music playing, and I had eight . bridesmaids which I requested to wear go-go outfits: short, really . bright dresses. I thought it would be dodgy but they were all fine about it. 'Some . of the guests went to fancy dress shops and made a huge effort - . everyone was dressed up. It was absolutely fantastic and brilliant fun.' Mark said: 'It was the best day of my life - it was so . relaxed and really specific to what we wanted, we were really pleased.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:02 EST, 2 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:14 EST, 3 September 2012 . A mystery consortium is drawing up plans for a four-runway airport close to Heathrow, it was claimed yesterday. The unnamed group of British businesses has commissioned a ‘world-leading infrastructure firm’ to assess potential sites to the west and north of London which could rival, or even replace, Heathrow. The claim came as it emerged that Cameron is to order an independent review of the future of Britain’s airports in a bid to end Coalition infighting over plans for a third runway at Britain’s only international hub airport. Hub: The new airport would have four runways and be within easy reach of London and the midlands . Expansion: Debate has raged for years over a 3rd runway at Heathrow . Demand: It's feared Britain will be left behind without a bigger airport - but campaigners have fiercely fought Heathrow expansion plans . The Prime Minister is hoping the review will secure cross-party support and defuse a row over aviation policy that has split the Cabinet. The consortium in the latest claims is reported to have opened talks with Chinese sovereign wealth funds over the financing of the project, which could cost between £40billion to £60billion. Transport Secretary: Justine Greening is preparing to launch a major consultation on future airport expansion . It is understood experts have been asked to evaluate tracts of land which could take such a large development, with sites in Berkshire and Oxfordshire potentially in the frame. Such a proposal would inevitably face opposition from communities and environmental groups. In a chaotic day yesterday senior Tories appeared to contradict each other on whether the party might revisit its pledge to rule out a new runway at Heathrow. George Osborne told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the Government needed to examine ‘all options’ for expanding airport capacity within the South East. ‘We need more runway capacity in the South East of England,’ he said. ‘Okay, then there’s a question of where it should go – Heathrow, new Estuary airport, Stansted, Gatwick? People have lots of different options. What I would say is let’s examine all the options. Let’s do it now.’ But within an hour Foreign Secretary William Hague took to the airwaves to rule out a U-turn on Heathrow. He told Sky News: ‘The circumstances have not changed, it’s important to stick to that election promise.’ The Conservative Party’s leader in Scotland also weighed in, saying a third runway at Heathrow was essential for both the UK and Scotland. Ruth Davidson said: ‘Priorities – and economic landscapes – change. In politics, you need to be big enough to change your mind.’ Last week the senior backbencher Tim Yeo issued a challenge to Mr Cameron to drop his opposition to expansion at Heathrow. Downing Street insists the Prime Minister will not back down over Heathrow, at least until after the 2015 election. Ministers hope that an independent review will take the political heat out of the situation and force the Lib Dems and Labour to agree a consensus solution. A report yesterday claimed an airport close to the Thames estuary might take only two years longer to build than a third runway at Heathrow. The analysis suggests that plans for a £23billion airport on the Isle of Grain, in Kent, could become a reality within 14 years.","Mystery consortium commissions firm to assess sites in Oxfordshire and Berkshire .

Experts say the potential for interactions between supplements and prescription drugs is substantial . Taking herbal or dietary supplements like echinacea , calcium or iron alongside prescription drugs could cause adverse side effects, as study warned. Other remedies such as St John's Wort, flaxseed, magnesium or ginkgo could also be bad for you when mixed with these medicines, it is believed. The research suggest combining the popular alternative remedies may cause mild-to-severe heart problems, chest pain, abdominal pain and headache, particularly among people receiving medication for problems with their central nervous or cardiovascular systems. Those taking Warfarin, insulin, aspirin, digoxin and ticlopidine had the greatest number of reported adverse interactions with the remedies or supplements. Combining the two affects the process by which some types of drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolised and eliminated by the body, the study warned . Yet scientists said the findings may just be the tip of the iceberg and said people needed to be aware of the health risks involved. But it pointed out herbal and botanical remedies were more likely to have adverse effects than the other dietary supplements, such as vitamins, minerals and amino acids. Emeritus Professor Edzard Ernst from the University of Exeter said: 'Survey after survey shows that large proportions of the population are trying 'natural' remedies for illness-prevention, all sorts of ailments, diseases or for states of reduced well-being. 'Most experts therefore agree that the potential for such interactions is substantial. Despite this consensus and despite the considerable amount of documented harm generated by such interactions, our current knowledge is still woefully incomplete.' The number of interactions between herbal and dietary supplements and prescribed drugs could be under-reported and just the tip of the iceberg, he added. Woman inside a greenhouse laboratory inspecting echinacea, a plant used to ward off colds by boosting the immune system . He called for greater government control and a need to warn of the potential dangers of mixing herbal and dietary supplements with prescribed drugs. He said: 'Patients deserve reliable information, and it is our duty to provide it. We have to become vigilant and finally agree to monitor this sector adequately. 'Each individual doctor can contribute to this process by routinely including questions about alternative medicine use in their medical history taking.' The study was carried out by Dr Hsiang-Wen Lin from the College of Pharmacy in Taiwan who said: 'Consumer use of herbal and dietary supplements has risen dramatically over the past two decades. 'In the USA, for example, it is estimated that more than 50 per cent of patients with chronic diseases or cancer use them and that many patients take them at the same time as prescribed medication. 'Despite their widespread use, the potential risks associated with combining herbal and dietary supplements with other medications, which include mild-to-severe heart problems, chest pain, abdominal pain and headache, are poorly understood.' The study looked at previous research into 213 herbal and dietary supplements entities and 509 prescribed medications and compared the 882 incidents of adverse reactions. More than 42 per cent of the drug interactions were caused by the herbal and dietary supplements altered the pharmacokinetics of the prescribed drugs - the process by which a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolised and eliminated by the body. Just over 26 per cent of the total were described as major interactions.Among the 152 identified contraindications, the most frequent involved the gastrointestinal system (16.4 per cent) and neurological system (14.5 per cent). Flaxseed, echinacea and yohimbe had the largest number of documented contraindications.

If it took a year and ten months to build the warship Sovereign of the Seas in the 17th century, how long would it take to make a 1:84 scale model today? The answer, astonishingly, is two years and seven months – nine months longer than shipwrights took over the original, which was the largest vessel of her time. It will also cost £804.65 for 135 issues of a new weekly magazine showing how to create the 110cm-long replica of the wooden Navy ship commissioned by Charles I and launched in 1637. Readers will have to buy 135 issues if they want to build the entire ship . The magazine will be launched at an introductory price of £1.99 but will cost £5.99 thereafter . The magazine – which has been widely advertised on TV – costs £1.99 for the first issue, then £5.99 per copy after that. Its website says: ‘HMS Sovereign of the Seas is a new magazine that comes  complete with all the parts to build a stunning model of the most powerful warship of the 17th century.’ But a spokesman for pressure group Consumer Focus said: ‘The cost of these magazines can really mount up. ‘Before taking on a long-running . subscription to make a ship or anything else, people should work out the . final cost and decide whether they feel that is worth paying.’ The magazine series includes detailed images showing how to put together the masts, rigging, guns and anchors. The . first edition details the origins of the ship in Chatham Dockyard and . includes a cannon and the first parts of the hull. The finished model is . 90cm high and 40cm wide. Rashid . Lalloo of Premier Ship Models, who has run his model ship-making . website for ten years, said you could buy a similar model ready-made for . around £300. He added: ‘Enthusiasts can buy a complete Sovereign of the Seas kit from a shop and complete it in a few months.’ HMS Sovereign of the Seas cost £65,586 when it was built which is the equivalent of £8million today . A . spokesman for DeAgostini, the firm behind the magazine, said: ‘This . type of partwork provides for a niche modelling audience a very . high-quality model in easy to manage parts. It is a tried and tested . formula much appreciated by our loyal modelling fans and allows . DeAgostini to create and develop beautiful ships to a degree of detail . and scale that is not normally available in the High Street.’ Sovereign of the Seas was the most magnificent ship of her era, with no expense spared during  her construction. The £65,586 cost is the equivalent of around £8million today. She was the first ship to have three full gun decks, carrying 102 guns on the orders of the King, instead of the 90 originally planned. All her guns were made from bronze instead of cast iron, which meant they were much lighter but four times more expensive. Sovereign was known by Britain’s enemies as the Golden Devil because of her stunning black and gold colouring. Her first engagement was the  Battle of Kentish Knock, fought in the North Sea during the First Dutch War in September 1652. Her career ended when she accidentally caught fire at Chatham, Kent, in January 1696.","Replica based on HMS Sovereign of the Seas from 1637 .

He has spent the past 40 years transmitting messages from the dead and reading people’s fortunes, but now professional ‘psychic’ Mark Edward Wilson says it’s time to draw back the curtain on his act. In a new tell-all book called ‘Psychic Blues: Confessions of a Conflicted Medium, the 61-year-old medium, who goes by the name Mark Edward, reveals the tricks of the trade that he has been using since the 1970s to make people believe in his ‘supernatural’ powers. While Edward’s memoir does not reveal any shocking secrets of the profession, it effectively drives home the point of how easily people can be duped, according to the New York Times. Medium: Mark Edward, 61, has been in the psychic business since the 1970s, reading palms and claiming to have the ability to communicate with the dead . For example, the 61-year-old psychic describes the old-fashioned trick in which he would talk to a member of the audience before the show, who would mention that his father’s name was Louis. Then during the performance, Edward would find the man he spoke to earlier in the crowd and say, ‘The name that comes to my mind is Lou. Who is Lou?’ More often than not, the targeted spectator will forget about his earlier encounter with the medium and be amazed at his ability to gaze right into his past. Tell-all: In his new memoir, Psychic Blues, Edward shares his tricks of the trade, among them per-screening the audience ahead of a performance . Edward’s desire to come clean about his supernatural machinations 40 years into his career is rooted in his claim that he belongs to a special cohort of magicians, among them the duo Penn and Teller and James Randi, who both perform tricks and debunk them to teach people how not to get hoodwinked in the future. In an interview with the Times, Edward said that after years of sympathizing with the skeptics while capitalizing on people’s gullibility, he felt he had to choose sides. ‘My conscience — I could no longer do it,’ Mr. Edward said. ‘I’d been walking both sides of the line. My magician friends’ — many of them skeptics — ‘thought I was selling out to the psychics, and the psychics thought I was selling out to the skeptics.’ While Edward strikes a repentant tone in his no-holds-barred volume, he at times defends his craft as pure entertainment and wallows in self-pity as he attempts to straddle both sides of the moral argument. However, the bread-and-butter of Edward’s craft is his ability to make vague, general statements about problems that are common to almost everyone, and which are most likely to hit the mark. ‘I sense that you have relationship issues,’ he told one caller to the Psychic Friends Network where he had worked in the 1990s, ‘which sometimes leave you fearful of the outcome.’ Ambivalent: While Edward strikes a repentant tone in his book, he also reveals that he continues to ply the psychic trade in his off-time . Life imitating art: Like the fictional repentant medium Patrick Jane in the CBS show The Mentalist, left, Edward, right, says it is key for a psychic to be able to read people and know what drives them . Like the fictional repentant pseudo-psychic Patrick Jane (played by actor Simon Baker) in the CBS show The Mentalist, a good medium is able to read people and know what makes members of different socioeconomic classes tick. In one case, Edward told one wealthy man that ‘what seems to be missing for you is a free space where you won’t be judged by your peers or have to succeed.’ Despite his expressly stated regret at having spent years conning gullible people seeking spiritual guidance, Edward reveals in his memoir that he is still in the psychic business. Mythbusters: James Randi, left, has published numerous books on debunking magic and mystery tricks and hoaxes, while the duo Penn (left) and Teller (right) have been known to reveal their ticks on stage . Edward has a day job working for the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation department, but in his off time, the 61-year-old divorced father still reads palms and delivers messages from beyond. In his view, however, Edward is still one of the ‘good guys’ because he does not take his psychic work too seriously, injecting humour and scepticism into his predictions and readings whenever he can.","Mark Edward has been working as a psychic since the 1970 .

Some 35 per cent of all dogs in Britain are overweight. But, made out of gluten-free flour, low-fat peanut butter, bananas and low-fat cream cheese frosting - and occasionally decorated with Bonio biscuits or doggy chocolate drops - Pupcakes won't be adding to the problem. In fact, the sweet treats have proved extremely popular with both dogs and their owners, and have been flying off the shelves of The Airyfairy Cake Boutique.

Completely vegan, Pupcakes are also suitable for humans (if a bit bland for our tastebuds, admits Miss Draper, who has tried them herself), though you should remove the dog biscuit topping or doggy chocolate drops first. And now the boutique has even bigger plans for the future. 'We've . started to do big Pupcakes too now, for bigger dogs like Alsatians,' said Miss Draper. 'They're six or eight inches and would serve about eight or ten people or . one or two big dogs.' Miss Draper used to be just a hobby baker, but took up the craft professionally after being asked to bake a wedding cake comprising over one hundred . lemon cupcakes with iced chicks on top, and a giant cupcake featuring two . 'bride, groom' chicks. She now makes hundreds of cakes every day, mainly for corporate events and weddings. 'But . being a lifelong dog lover and many of our regular customers having . dogs, we decided to start catering for them. We got a request for a bowl . of water for a puppy outside and that was the trigger for us deciding . to welcome them in. 'They're . a bit of a treat and a bit of fun and are creating a bit of a stir. The . feedback has been fantastic - a couple of dogs have tried to push . through the door into the shop and we think it's because they like our Pupcakes so much. 'It's going so well that it is opening up a whole new market to us. We love it and the dogs do too.'

Arsenal fan Chris Webber has celebrated shedding a massive 25 stone in a year by buying his first ever team shirt.

It came after he had a gastric bypass operation last April on the NHS and slimmed down from 37 stone to 12. Arsenal fan Chris Webber from Clacton, Essex, fits into the team kit for the first time after shedding 25 stone . He said: 'Arsenal is the love of my life so finally being able to wear the strip is a dream come true.' 'Up until last month it was impossible to find a shirt that fit me. I’ve never even been to the Emirates because the seats are too small.' 'The last game I went to was in a friendly against Celtic in 1978 - when you could stand up on the terraces.' 'My parents wouldn’t let me have an Arsenal shirt when I was at school because we lived in a mainly Spurs area and they thought it might invite trouble.' 'In my youth I was fit and had football trials at Southend United - so no one was more surprised than me at how big I became.' The father-of-four's incredible weight loss came after he had a gastric bypass operation last April . The father-of-four said his world fell apart after he and his ex-wife Angie, 50, lost their daughter Shannon, when she was born with the umbilical chord wrapped around her neck 16 years ago. Mr Webber turned to food for comfort and his weight ballooned to almost 40 stone. 'In the space of ten years I lost my job, my marriage fell apart and I went from weighing 19 stone to almost 40.' 'I used to visit my friends cafe every day, eat a massive cooked breakfast washed down with cups of sweet tea. After a big roast lunch I would go home and have dinner followed by a takeaway.' 'I couldn’t walk more than a few yards without getting out of breath. I got stuck in the bath twice and my wife eventually fell out of love with me.'

'When I went to visit Abbie in Australia she walked right past me at the airport because she hadn’t seen me for more than a year and didn’t recognise me.' 'I was terrified that other day when I found a lump in my chest, but my daughter Kylie told me it was just my breast bone - I’d never felt it before.' 'I’m very excited about this season - I’ve got a good feeling about it. Of course I’m disappointed that Van Persie has gone, though.'

"By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 09:42 EST, 20 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:56 EST, 20 September 2012 . A mother-of-four had emergency surgery after her brain became riddled with tapeworm larvae. Suki-Jane Taylor, 42, contracted neurosysticerosis in 2009, a parasitic disease of the nervous system, after she was infected by pork tapeworm eggs. The eggs are spread through food, water, . or surfaces that have been contaminated with faeces. The tapeworm larvae travelled to her brain where they formed cysts. When they started to die they caused an aneurysm the size of a tangerine in Miss Taylor's brain. Miss Suki Taylor (right) had major brain surgery to treat a brain aneurysm that was most probably caused by tapeworm larvae . She was rushed to St George's Hospital, in south London, where an MRI revealed the dangerously swollen blood vessel. Surgeons were quick to operate, inserting a shunt in her skull to drain away a build up of fluid. She . suffered a loss of taste and smell as a result of the rare condition . and now suffers from epilepsy and depression. Miss Taylor said: 'If it hadn’t been . for my partner’s insistence that they keep me in at St George’s and I . see a specialist and had an MRI scan they wouldn’t have found the . aneurysm. 'They removed . it straight away and when I was coming around he was talking to my . partner and he said I was two weeks away from death. It was right at the . top of my spine at the back of my brain.' Neurocysticercosis is very rare in developed countries causing just 24 cases a year in the UK and 1,500 cases in the U.S. Infected: The pork tapeworm larvae forms inside cysts (sacs) and can cause tissue inflammation when they die . It is contracted by ingesting eggs excreted . by a person who has an intestinal tapeworm. People living in the same . household with a tapeworm carrier have a much higher risk of getting . cysticercosis than others. It is only spread along a faecal to oral route. Once ingested, the larvae embed in tissues including the brain, forming cysticerci (cyst sacs).  These can cause seizures and . headaches. However, confusion, lack of . attention to people and surroundings, difficulty with balance and excess . fluid around the brain (called hydrocephalus) can also occur. If left untreated the . disease can result in death. Symptoms can occur months to years . after infection, usually when the cysts are in the process of dying, so . it's almost impossible for a patient to know when they picked it up. When the parasites die the brain tissue around the cyst can swell. The . pressure caused by swelling is what causes most of the symptoms. Infections are generally treated with anti-parasitic . drugs in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgery is sometimes . necessary to treat cysts in certain locations. Miss Taylor is now fighting another battle - this time to be moved from her third-floor council flat for fear of having an epileptic fit while alone with her children. Miss Taylor, who has been on the housing list to move since 2001, is currently living in Colliers Wood, south London, with her partner, two-year-old son, 12 year-old-son who has Asperger’s syndrome, and 10-year-old daughter. Miss Taylor, pictured with her children Fred (left), Bertie and Mille, now suffers from epilepsy. Her neurologist said climbing stairs to her council flat is endangering her health . She regularly climbs the three flights of stairs carrying her two-year-old, despite neurologists warning her doing so could cause an epileptic seizure putting herself and her child in danger. She said: 'My balance has gone, my sense of smell and taste has gone and my eyesight has got worse. 'If I carry too much up and down the stairs I can have an epileptic fit.  I can sometimes feel that I have taken the stairs when I haven’t. 'My consultant has said if I am moved to a property where I haven’t got any steps she could take me off of the epileptic tablets. I’m alive and I’m going to see my children grow up, but I have been left by Wandle Housing Association. In a letter to Wandle Housing Association, Miss Taylor’s consultant neurologist described her accommodation as “unacceptable”, calling for her to be moved as a “priority”. A Housing Association spokesman said it . recognised the family had been 'dealing with what is clearly a very . stressful situation' and they were working hard to find a suitable . property for Miss Taylor.

A new piece of stencilled graffiti, possibly by Banksy, has appeared overnight on the wall of a Poundland shop in London. It shows a young Asian boy hunched over a sewing machine with real Union Flag bunting attached - and given the artist's controversial past works, it could be a dark reflection on the imminent Olympics or the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. However, as the pictures below show, someone later removed the bunting, which had been attached high across the wall. Residents near Turnpike Lane in Haringey, north London, noticed the artwork this morning on the side of the nearby bargain store - which sells similar bunting - and has itself been at the centre of controversy. Now you see it... A new piece of stencilled graffiti, possibly by Banksy, has appeared on the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey, north London . The artwork, which was created overnight, shows a young Asian boy hunched over a sewing machine with real Union Flag bunting attached . ... now you don't . Someone later removed all the bunting from the piece . Two years ago, Poundland launched an inquiry after a boy of seven was found to be working 100 hours a week in an Indian sweatshop producing goods for the store (file photo) Two years ago, Poundland launched an inquiry after a boy of seven was found to be working 100 hours a week in an Indian sweatshop producing goods for the store. The child, known as Ravi, was reportedly earning just 7p a hour to make napkin rings for the cut-price chain. The company severed ties with the supplier and issued a statement saying it 'did not tolerate child labour under any circumstances'. All Banksy works can be found on his official website but, as this is not yet the case with the latest piece, it is unknown whether the artist created it. The artist, who has amassed a fortune selling his work at auction, appeared to have secretly painted the wall in the early hours of yesterday morning with the help of two collaborators. Holly-Jade Leathers, 14, who lives on the road, told the Evening Standard: 'I came down here at about four in the morning and there were three guys who looked homeless with their backs to the wall. In July 2010, Poundland launched an inquiry into the 'Indian sweatshop' claims concerning Ravi. The boy was found to be working and sleeping in the factory in Delhi. His ‘wages’ of under £7 a week were sent to his widowed mother in a poverty-stricken rural village hundreds of miles away in the east­ern state of Bihar. The cheap trinkets he decorated were bought by Trishulin Overseas, a Delhi company which supplied the cut-price chain. The bargain store was founded by Britons Dave Dodd and Stephen Smith in 1990, but was sold in May 2010 to U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus for £200million. Poundland has more than 250 outlets across Britain, and employs about 7,000 people. The company confirmed at the time that it had placed orders with Trishulin, but said it was a new sup­plier and they had not yet received any of the goods. ‘Poundland does not tolerate child labour under any circum­stances and will not work with companies that employ children,’ a spokesman said. 'They must have been painting it on the wall somehow because I came back past at six o’clock and it was there in the exact same spot.' Excited locals gathered round to take photos of the artwork, which could b e worth thousands of pounds. Saqib Khalid, 16, who lives nearby, told the paper: 'It’s inspiring to see graffiti on the streets of London which is actually good art and not vandalism.' James Longshaw, 42, who works in new media, said: 'It’s a work of art, so of course I enjoy it. It will probably put house prices up in the area – that’s what has happened in areas where he has been before. 'I don’t see why anyone should object - all it means is the area has arrived. He isn’t attacking the area, he is attacking businesses in the area which exploit people in sweatshops. 'Banksy is promoting an issue by painting this but I don’t think a lot of people will know what it means – they might think it is just any graffiti.' In the past, graffiti by the elusive artist has caused house prices to skyrocket. In 2008, a Portobello Road wall adorned with his name fetched £200,000 on eBay. His work is known for its strident anti-establishment message, which has done nothing to damage his popularity among celebrities and the super-rich – his 2010 film Exit Through The Gift Shop was nominated for an Oscar. Banksy’s famous work includes a vandalised phone box crumpled in half with a pickaxe in its side. He once climbed into the penguin enclosure at London Zoo and painted 'We’re bored of fish' in 7ft high letters. At the 2004 Notting Hill Carnival, the prankster handed out spoof British £10 notes substituting the picture of the Queen’s head with Diana, Princess of Wales head and changing the text 'Bank of England' to 'Banksy of England'.

The small necklaces have amber gems on a string but mothers have complained that some have snapped, sending the tiny stones spilling onto the ground. There are fears that curious tots could put the stones in their mouths and choke - or that they could even strangle themselves with the necklaces. Danger: Amber teething bracelets such as this one could snap and babies could choke on the small gemstones, Trading Standards has warned . Trading Standards officers have issued warnings about the amber teething necklaces and some have been withdrawn from the market. The teething necklaces and bracelets have also been condemned by parenting group Netmums as 'costly and unproven'. But the dangerous products are still widely available online, including at internet giants such as Amazon and eBay. Trading Standards said that the necklaces are also being sold by market traders around the country. A toddler wears a necklace similar to the teething products. There are risks children could strangle themselves (file picture) There are fears that many mothers have already brought them or will do so unaware of the risks. Sarah Ridley, Trading Standards officer at Nottinghamshire County Council said: 'Although the necklaces are designed to be worn, not chewed, there is a serious risk involved in giving any product with small parts to small children. 'Should the beads or clasps become detached, the parts are a choking hazard and the necklace as a whole presents a risk of strangulation.' The necklaces are designed to be worn by babies to sooth and calm them when they are teething - a common problem for babies. A number of different designs and styles are available over the internet and they are targeted at children under 36 months. The prices range from £6.95 for a small bracelet up to £26.95 for some of the necklaces. Many of the necklaces are believed to be made in eastern Europe, where manufacturing controls are not as strict as the UK. The chance of small parts breaking off and choking babies has caused a number of the bracelets to fail safety tests. There are also concerns that magnets found on some of the necklaces and bracelets could stick together inside the stomach if they are swallowed. Customer reviews on Amazon included angry comments from mothers who became panicked after the bracelets snapped while their children were wearing them. One mother wrote last month: 'I bought this for my six-month-old son after hearing good things about it but I had just changed him and he was lying on the floor and managed to snap it.

A graphic film featuring a middle-aged woman traveling to Africa for sex with male gigolos has been praised at Cannes Film Festival. In Paradise: Love,  the first part of a trilogy, director Ulrich Seidl explores the subject of sex tourism among rich, European white women . The film had its gala premiere yesterday where it is one of 22 films competing for the Palme d'Or. Paradise: Love, stars Margaret Tiesel whose search for love turns increasingly predatory. Screened yesterday, Ms Tiesel appears nude through much of the film and has several graphic scenes with Kenyan beach boys . Strong views: 'Women from the rich West exploit young African men. But it's also a business, and they (the men) get something for it,' said director Ulrich Seidl . Margarethe Tiesel plays divorcee Teresa, who packs her teen daughter off to weight-loss camp and heads to Kenya where a friend has assured her that sex is plentiful. Soon she meets Munga (Peter Kazungu) and as their relationship develops Teresa believes he doesn't want money. But soon he starts asking for funds, claiming he needs cash for his sister’s baby, his father’s medical bills or his cousin’s school, but never for himself. The movie stars Margarethe Tiesel as a 50-year-old Austrian whose search for love turns increasingly predatory. Previously a stage actress, this is her first major film role and she appears nude through much of the film and has several graphic scenes with Kenyan beach boys. But the actress told journalists that she did not judge the character's behavior. She said the movie examined female loneliness and the way 'people who are exploited at home travel abroad and become exploiters in turn.' Mr Seidl, who looked at east-west friction in Europe in his 2007 Cannes entry 'Import/Export,' plans the film as the first in a trilogy about modern tourism. The director views his European and African characters with the detached eye of an anthropologist. Seidl began as a documentary maker, and even on his fiction features shoots without scripted dialogue and mixes professional and nonprofessional actors. 'Paradise: Love' had a mixed reception from critics in Cannes. Cast at Cannes: Actors Inge Maux, Peter Kazungu and Margarete Tiesl pose during the photocall . Theory: Ulrich Seidl, one of 22 directors competing for the top prize at Cannes this year, said many Western women were looking for more than a holiday fling, a key difference to male sex tourism in developing countries . Some accused it of reproducing the exploitation of Africans that it claims to examine — or, like the Hollywood Reporter, simply found it 'a psychologically empty wallow.' Others praised the bravery of the actors, who are required to strip naked, physically and emotionally, as they enact the characters' sexual negotiations. 'It wasn't easy, it's true,' Ms Tiesel said. 'It was a challenge to surpass yourself, to go beyond your comfort zone. But in the beginning Ulrich said to me: 'Nothing will happen that you don't want to happen.' So that reassured me.' Mr Seidl said many Western women were looking for more than a holiday fling, a key difference to male sex tourism in developing countries. 'Women from the rich West exploit young African men. But it's also a business, and they (the men) get something for it,' reported news.com.au. But Mr Seidl rejected the suggestion he is a pessimist. 'As a filmmaker my goal is to depict things as honestly as possible,"" he said. ""To deal with social systems, to show them as realistically as possible. Negative, positive, pessimistic, whatever — that's not really the point here.'","Margarethe Tiesel appears nude through much of the picture and has several graphic scenes with Kenyan beach boys .

The price immediately dropped precipitously in the days after the May 18 IPO.  By Monday afternoon, it had fallen 30 percent, to less than $27 a share. 'Zucked': Mark Zuckerberg has aroused so much anger about Facebook's IPO that he has inspired two lawsuits and a new word of disgust -- 'zucked' Analyst firm Bernstein projected Facebook had to fall another $2, to $25, before the company would reach its true value. Such is the anger over Facebook's IPO, the most anticipated in decades, that some critics are claiming it was a 'pump-and-dump' operation -- where the owners of a stock deliberately inflate the value based on false information and then cash out before the price collapses. Others have coined a new word to describe their financial state after Zuckerberg's social media giant went public -- 'zucked.' TMZ reports the new lawsuit, the second in two weeks, names Zuckerberg, along with Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. As evidence of Zuckerberg's knowledge, the plaintiffs cite the Facebook founder's disclosure filings that lists 30.2 million shares of the company he sold right after the stock went public. Initial public flop: Shares of Facebook have fallen 30 percent since Zuckerberg proudly announced the $38 IPO of his social media giant . The sale, at $38 a share, netted him $1.13 billion. If he sold the shares today, they would be worth $800 million. Other big-time Facebook investors, who got in on the company before the IPO, raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from dumping off their stock at $38 a share. The new lawsuit is similar to ones filed within days of the IPO, alleging that top executives knew their stock was going to tank after initial trading. Those suits say Facebook warned the banks behind its IPO that the company would fall short of its expected revenue for the second quarter. The banks knew this information, even as Facebook was selling its $16 billion stock offering to the public, the plaintiffs allege. Instead of coming clean with the damaging news, according to the lawsuits banks like Morgan Stanley shared it only with big investors -- allowing them to stay away from the stock until the price dropped to reflect the lower earnings. Facebook has previously strongly denied the allegations. Morgan Stanley has said it did nothing during the Facebook IPO that it wouldn't have done for any other company's stock offering.","Shares of the social media giant have dropped 30 percent to below $27 .

Doctors at Houston's Memorial hospital live-tweeted brain surgery on Twitter today, complete with graphic video, photos and up-to-the-minute commentary. Beginning at 8.30 a.m EST, approximately 14 million people from Mexico to Australia followed the brain resection on an unnamed 21-year-old girl as Dr. Dong Kim removed a benign tumour from her posterior right temporal lobe. A veteran of up to 300 craniotomies a year, Dr. Kim was involved in the team that treated former U.S Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords last year after she was shot in the head at point-blank range. Scroll Down for Video (Warning Graphic Content) Dr. Dong Kim removed a benign tumour from a 21-year-old girl today and the operation was live-Tweeted onto the Internet . The surgery took roughly four hours from anesthesia through the surgery as Dr. Kim opened a two inch by two inch hole in the side of the patients skull and exposed the brain for 90 minutes as the neurosurgeon removed the tumour. Interaction with the public during the surgery was provided by Dr. Scott Shepard, a neurosurgeon with Mischer Neuroscience Institute at Memorial Hermann in Houston. The surgery was successful as Dr. Kim removed the cavernous angioma tumour from the 21-year-old girl's brain. Dr. Kim during surgery (left) performed the operation at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston and the neurosurgeon (right)  is known for treating U.S Congresswoman Garielle Giffords after she was shot in Tucson last year . The social-media medical team put together by the hospital tweeted every step of the operation, opening up a little known field of surgery to the public. The patient, whose tumour was discovered after she suffered seizures, benefited from the latest advantages in neuro-navigation. Assisted by a MRI map of the brain, Dr. Kim was guided to the tumour exactly like a GPS would a car to its destination. The patient an anonymous 21-year-old girl lies on the surgical table . The surgical team tweeted every aspect and step of the surgery such as this picture of the patients skull with the outline for the area intended for operation marked . X-marks the Spot: Guided by MRI imagery and neuro-navigation technology the team were given a map to the source of the tumour . After the craniotomy removed the piece of skull needed to access the brain, the surgeon used the neuro-navigation to guide a microscope to take the offending mass out of the brain. 'Social media is a very powerful communications vehicle in helping to demystify the process of brain surgery,' said Dr. Kim, who performed brain surgery on former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. 'So our goal of performing this surgery live via Twitter is to educate the general public about brain tumors and take them into the OR to see what happens during a brain surgery. 'Someone may have a loved one who is considering a similar procedure and perhaps they can glean some information from this Twittercast that may help them make a decision about whether surgery is the right choice for them. 'One neat thing about this is we should be able to get actual images of the brain surface itself,' said Dr. Kim. 'Hopefully you'll see video of the brain actually pulsating with heartbeats.' Each aspect of the surgical process was dealt with, from the cold metal surgical instruments to the ultra high-tech neuro-navigation device. Explaining that the anonymous patient would have no immediate access to extra blood because Dr. Kim deemed it unlikely the patient would need any, the surgical process was begun just around 10 a.m according to the New York Daily News. Small snippets of detail were most illuminating, such as the fact that the operating theatre was kept at a relatively chilly 62 degrees Fahrenheit so that the surgeon and the patient did not overheat during the stressful procedure. First cut: Dr. Kim begins the surgery followed by up to 14 million live Twitter followers . The bone-flap was handed to the surgical nurse to keep it sterile during surgery . Every aspect of the operation was explained on the live-feed including the various instruments used in the removal of the tumour . Warning all followers that what they would witness would be graphic, the live Twitter feed was nevertheless viewed by millions. Followers were informed of the two separate preps undertaken before surgery by Dr. Kim as well as the fact that bacteriostatic agents are used to sterilise the scalp. Even though the operation was described as routine by Houston Memorial Hospital before-hand, the hospital was keen to point out that the risks for brain surgery include infection, internal bleeding, stroke and seizures. Handing out little kernels of knowledge throughout the surgery, Dr. Shepard reminded the Twitter feed followers that craniotomy is one of the oldest known surgeries to man, dating back to the Neolithic period where it was understood that drilling into the brain relieved built-up pressure. With the outline of the skull visible where the flap has been removed this is the first glimpse the surgeon and Twitter had of the patients brain . Upon entry to the 21-year-old patients brain this was the first glimpse of the tumour for the surgeon and his millions of Twitter followers . As Dr. Kim peels back the layers of the brain he approaches the benign tumour . The tumour had been causing the patient to experience seizures and was discovered one month before today's operation . Once the distressing sound of drilling was finished, a piece of skull known as the bone-flap was handed to the surgical nurse to keep it sterile during surgery. Once the outermost fibrous layer of the brain known as the dura was peeled back then access to the grey matter was available to Dr. Kim. Using a variety of precise tools, the accomplished surgeon removed the benign tumour and the team began to close the wound and to replace the skull fragment. If the two veins that can be seen centre had been knicked during the operation the patient would have had a stroke . Dr. Scott Shepard was the Internet's guide on Twitter for the operation . Every aspect of the surgery was relayed to Twitter followers . After approximately four hours the team wrapped up their surgery . As bone in the skull does not have to be encouraged to reform, the skull-flap can be simply replaced like a missing jigsaw piece and the nylon sutures used to sew back up the skin. Just before the skull was sewn the team performed the second of two instrument counts just to be 100 percent sure. Then the patient was wheeled into the ICU where she was woken up just 15 minutes after leaving the operating room. Incredibly she will be ready to leave the hospital in only three days. 'The main reason I wanted to do this was for educational purposes,' said Dr. Kim to ABC news.","Up to 14 million people followed the live-commentary on Twitter .

After paying $16 to file a one-page claim to an empty, $340,000 home in an upscale Dallas suburb, Kenneth Robinson moved in furniture, hung a 'No Trespassing' sign in the front window and invited television cameras inside for a tour. But after eight months of defending his use of what he claimed was a little-known legal loophole, Mr Robinson's time in the house ran out Monday. Bank of America wants possession . after foreclosing on the home last month, and a judge on Monday gave . Mr Robinson until February 13 to appeal or move out. Scroll down for video . McMansion: Kenneth Robinson took advantage of a little known Texas law to move into this $340,000 abandoned home in Flower Mound, Texas on June 17 .

'It's been a huge learning experience,' he said in a phone call with reporters. Mr Robinson quickly turned into something of a . local celebrity, creating a website, http://16dollarhouse.com, where he . sold an e-book and offered training sessions for would-be squatters. On the website, he describes . himself as a savvy investor who's part of a 'paradigm shift' in which . people have taken over abandoned homes. Last June, under a law known as . adverse possession, he filed a claim in court promising to pay taxes and . homeowners' association fees while living in the house. He kept the . lawn outside mowed, and the front clean. Mr Robinson told reporters last week while standing at the front door of the two-story, . 3,200-square-foot home with a backyard pool. He declined to discuss his . background or say how much money he made from book sales or seminars . related to his takeover. Squatter: Kenneth Robinson answers the front door at the Flower Mound home . Well-kept: Mr Robinson vacuums the spacious living room of the home he occupied for eight months, to the frustration of his neighbours . He said he started his website - . which describes him as 'poised, measured, insightful and wise' - to keep . the media and others from misleading the public about his story. 'They think some bum off the street . came and paid $15 to get a $300,000 house by filing a piece of . paperwork,' Mr Robinson said. 'That is not the case. That is the sum of . what happened.' 'They think some bum off the street came and paid $15 to get a $300,000 house by filing a piece of paperwork,' Mr Robinson said. 'That is not the case.

Someone who has openly taken . charge of abandoned land for an extended period of time - using a . driveway on a neighbour's property, for example - could try to claim . that land later, he said.

Grey Pierson said the law is often used to resolve disputes between . homeowners over driveways, lawns or other property with shared . boundaries - not to take someone's house. Paperwork: Mr Robinson did months of research on 'adverse possession', filled out the forms for $16 and claimed he legally owned the home . It's not clear how long the home in . Flower Mound was empty before Robinson moved in. Its last owner, William . Ferguson, bought the house for $332,000 in 2005 and appeared to run . into trouble making payments about three years later, according to . county records. Ferguson did not have a listed phone number, and the . records don't indicate where he moved.

Adverse possession statutes can be . found in most states and are often used to resolve disputes between homeowners over driveways, lawns or other property with shared . boundaries. According to Arlington, Texas real estate attorney Grey Pierson, it is not often used to take someone's house as in Mr Robinson's case. Someone who has openly taken . charge of abandoned land for an extended period of time - using a . driveway on a neighbour's property, for example - could try to claim . that land later, however, according to some legal experts.

Until then, anyone trying to . stake claim to a piece of property owned by someone else is just a . squatter, says Brian C Rider, a real estate lawyer and . professor at the University of Texas. County clerks in North Texas said . they have seen such a spike in adverse possession filings that they've . stopped accepting the claims without prosecutors' approval. In a handful . of cases, squatters entered homes that weren't abandoned, but left . empty for a few days. 'We just had people making bad . decisions, taking a portion of the law and applying it in a way that was . not legal,' Tarrant County clerk Mary Louise Garcia said. In one case, an Arlington travel . nurse came home in September to find her locks changed and two TVs . missing, according to a police report. Authorities say Anthony Brown . came to the front door and told her that he had claimed the home and she . was trespassing. When the nurse asked Brown for his . paperwork, he offered to return the home for $2,000, police said. Brown, . who was arrested in October, does not have an attorney listed and did . not respond to messages left on his cellphone. Tarrant County constable Clint . Burgess said authorities have interviewed a handful of people claiming' adverse possession' who said they spoke to Mr Robinson. The Fort Worth . Star-Telegram reported Robinson attended a December eviction hearing for . two charged with burglary. Mr Robinson said then he was attending to show . support for the couple. He says now that he doesn't want to be an example to others. 'The truth is I don't want people to . think that they should go out there and do anything based on what I . did,' he said last week. 'Whether they do it or whether they're not is . solely up to them.' Robinson hasn't been charged with a . crime but police said they responded to several calls from his . neighbours.

"By . Julian Gavaghan . UPDATED: . 10:08 EST, 22 May 2012 . America's most hated mother Casey Anthony has been found ten months after she went into hiding following her sensational acquittal over the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee. The 26-year-old, who has been vilified by the public after a jury found her not guilty despite a string of inconsistencies in her trial defence, was served a court order for a defamation case. She will now face a judge again in connection with the controversial murder probe after investigators staked out her hideout in Florida and served her with a subpoena. Facing judge again: Casey Anthony, pictured posing in a recent racy Facebook snap,  is being sued for defamation by Zenaida Gonzalez, who shares the name with a fake kidnapper made up by Anthony . She is being sued by Zenaida Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter 'Zanny the Nanny' who Anthony initially told police had kidnapped Caylee. Anthony admitted fabricating that story. It later emerged that Anthony, whose acquittal last July has been compared to the infamous OJ Simpson case, did not know anyone by that name and the real Miss Gonzalez is not even a nanny. Now Miss Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008. After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool. It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release from Orange County Jail. Gone: Anthony was acquitted of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee in a trial that ended last July . Concentration: Casey Anthony appears in court with attorney Cheny Mason during her murder trial . Casey Anthony (centre) confers with attorneys Jose Baez, and Dorothy Clay Simser . Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter. She was convicted of four counts of lying to police and is now on probation on an unrelated cheque fraud conviction. The defamation trial is set to begin at the start of the New Year. But, as Anthony had not been seen in public, lawyers for Miss Gonzalez feared she might go missing and decided to track her down. They staked out her home for several days without Anthony appearing to be served a subpoena. Eventually, the defendant's lawyers intervened and said she would attend the court hearing. 'Our investigation team had her whereabouts pinned down,' Miss Gonzalez's attorney Matt Morgan told People magazine. 'Their backs were against the wall, so her attorneys said that they would accept service on her behalf.' Despite going into hiding, Anthony had not entirely shied away from publicity. In hiding: Casey has been spending time with her new boyfriend who she made reference to in the new video . She's back: Sporting short, blonde locks and glasses, Anthony is almost unrecognisable on the YouTube video diary . All smiles: Casey Anthony hugs what appears to be her adopted Yorkshire Terrier Smooch in a photo of the 26-year-old . In October she appeared in a video diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes for herself', although failed to mention Caylee. It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptised again in a bid to  symbolise a new beginning. However, this apparent new devotion to faith has not stopped her revealing a string of racy photographs of herself. Anthony has been in hiding in Florida since she was acquitted last July in one of the most controversial verdicts since the OJ Simpson case. She was released from prison after a jury found her not guilty of killing her daughter Caylee in 2008, after the toddler's remains were found in woods near Anthony's family's home.","Anthony, 26, tracked down to hideout in Florida and served a court order .

Swedish home furnishings giant Ikea hired translators to check the names of 9,000 of its products - to make sure they didn't mean something rude in Thai. The Wall Street Journal reports that the retail chain spent nearly four years on the project to spare the blushes of its South-East Asian clients. And for good reason. Embarrasing: Ikea hired a team of linguists to check their catalog to make sure their home furnishings didn't mean something rude in Thai . The Journal found that 'Redalen' the name of an Ikea bed, 'sounds uncomfortably close to getting to third base in Thailand,' and 'Jattebra' - a grey plant pot - 'could sound like slang for sex'. After realising the embarrassing blunder Ikea hired a team of linguists to make sure that items from its catalog are appropriate when translated from Swedish to Thai. Confectionery retailer Kraft on the . other hand didn't seem to have the same due diligence when researching . Mondelez International, the new name for its global snack foods brand. And were left rather red faced when it emerged that the word sounded like oral sex in Russian. Ikea was founded in 1943 in Sweden by 17-year-old Ingvar Kamprad. The first UK store opened in 1987 and Brits fell in love with its reasonably priced home furnishings and ready-to-assemble furniture. Hailed as the world's most successful mass-market retailer the chain now has 230 stores in 33 countries and hosts a whopping 410 million shoppers per year. But although it's easy to see the appeal of not many would go as far as Julie 'Bunny' Rodgers and Willie 'Bear' Pittman who got married at their local branch this year. Two years after they met at the store in Maryland, US, the happy couple decided their favourite shop was the perfect venue  their nuptials. Bizarrely the racy translation didn't deter shareholders, who last month voted overwhelmingly to adopt the name. Other companies have learned the hard way to take precautions. According to The Huffington Post luxury car manufacturer Bugatti once described a car as being available in the color 'rape yellow.' The mixup was the result of a French to English translation error of 'rapeseed plant.'Similarly, according to the BBC, General Motors was forced to change the name of the Buick LaCrosse sedan in Canada when it came to light that 'LaCrosse' is slang for masturbation in Quebec.And in Germany, 'vicks' can be a term for sex, so Vicks cough drops are called Wicks in Germany, according to the Toronto Star.","Linguists found that 'Redalen', the name of an Ikea bed, sounded uncomfortably close to getting to third base in Thai .

Francis Kasha, a livestock keeper, whose animals were killed in a previous attack says these types of incidents have been on the increase, forcing herders to find a solution on how to protect their animals.

'We gathered as we waited for Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) officials to come and catch the lions, but some people became too rowdy and it was impossible to stop them from killing the lions.' Herders say the KWS, tasked by the government as wildlife custodians, needs to review how they compensate those who lose their animals, which the herders deem as below market value.

Reaction: The outrage the advert has caused echoes the controversy caused in 2008, when the Spanish Olympic basketball team angered Asian rights groups by posing for a photo pushing up the outside corners of their eyes . Disturbing: A group that represents Asians in the United States described the photo as 'disturbing' and 'divisive' On their presentation the advert . agency said its brief was 'to promote travel agency, especially its . Asian destinations, including exclusive ethnic tours.' It said their idea was to 'Make people experience Asian like Asians do.' And their controversial solution was: . 'We created outdoor campaign with titles which can be read only if you . screw your eyes in order to see the world literally as Asians do.' Four years ago the Spanish . basketball team landed in trouble over an advertisement showing the . players from both the men's and the women's team using their fingers to . make their eyes look more Chinese. The pictures, which has been running . as a newspaper spread in Spain since Friday, shows both sets of players . making the gesture on a basketball court adorned with a Chinese dragon. They were part of a publicity campaign for team sponsor Seur and was only used in Spain. It is not the first time that an advertising campaign has been branded racist. Although there are several in the past which have been dubious, even this year PopChips pulled an Ashton Kutcher advert after an internet outcry.

Detectives investigating the fatal shooting of a father in Leeds four years ago have released CCTV footage of a woman fleeing the murder scene. Adam Chadwick, 20, was gunned down when three masked men and the woman burst into his sister's house in the Harehills area of the city in 2008. He was visiting his sister Gemma on June 24 when at 9.40pm the female suspect knocked on the door and asked to speak to 'Michelle'. Scroll down for video . Victim: Adam Chadwick, pictured with his daughter Ruby, was gunned down when three masked men and the woman burst into his sister's house in Leeds in 2008 . She was told that nobody by that name lived there. But an hour later, the woman again knocked on the door and asked for Michelle. Three black men wearing masks and camouflage clothing then barged through the front door of the house. A disturbance followed during which Mr Chadwick, whose daughter Ruby was three at the time, was shot in the head. He died two days later in hospital. It is believed that he was shot in what could have been a case of mistaken identity. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley said: 'There were a number of people involved in this murder and I firmly believe discussions will have taken place among the communities of Leeds about those involved. Vital clue: Detectives investigating the fatal shooting have released CCTV footage of a woman fleeing the murder scene . E-fit: The suspect is in her late 20s, thin and with dark brown hair and prominent cheekbones. Mr Chadwick . 'With the length of time that has passed someone may now feel in a position to come forward and speak to us. 'I would urge that person to think about the potential difference they could make to Adam's family, who are desperate to know why he died and who was responsible.' The woman is known to have knocked on other doors in the area and asked for 'Michelle' prior to the shooting. Despite numerous appeals, including an appearance on BBC show Crimewatch, detectives have failed to solve the case. They have now issued an e-fit of the suspect, who is in her late 20s, thin and with dark brown hair and prominent cheekbones. She was wearing a baggy black fleece or cardigan over a black round-neck top. Previously unseen CCTV footage has also emerged that shows the suspects' getaway car, a Ford Focus C-Max, being stolen from a 48 year-old woman at Oatland Heights in the Little London area of Leeds two weeks earlier.

Mr Chadwick's father Martin said he wants the murder to be solved for the sake of his now seven-year-old granddaughter. He said: 'We want it to be sorted before she gets too old. We haven't lied to her, she doesn't know the full truth of what happened. 'She does keep asking questions, we tell her as truthfully as we can or we dare.'

'Fox in charge of the chicken coop': Paul Mahoney has been made the UK representative at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . A eurocrat who has never been a judge in Britain was last night appointed the UK’s representative at the European Court of Human Rights. Paul Mahoney beat off two other candidates – including a QC who has acted for radical cleric Abu Qatada – to become a £150,000-a-year judge at the Strasbourg court. The 65-year-old worked for the Council of Europe, which runs the human rights court, for more than 30 years. He was its registrar – senior staff lawyer – from 2001 to 2005, and has written in academic papers that the court can ‘make new law’. Horrified Tory MPs likened his appointment to ‘putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop’. He was in post for the hearings which led to the ruling that prisoners must be granted the vote. He was also the legal adviser to the Euro judges who ruled in 1999 that Jon Venables and Robert Thompson did not receive a fair trial for the killing of James Bulger and that it was not up to the Home Secretary to set their minimum punishment period. The court also awarded costs and expenses of £15,000 to Thompson and £29,000 to Venables. Most worrying for Tory MPs are comments made by Mr Mahoney on whether European judges should be allowed to make laws. Academic papers seen by the Mail quote Mr Mahoney as saying that: ‘The open textured language and the structure of the Convention (on Human Rights) leave the Court significant opportunities for choice in interpretation.’ He goes on: ‘In exercising that choice, particularly when faced with changed circumstances and attitudes in society, the Court makes new law.’ Last night, Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘Someone who has spent over 30 years working in the Strasbourg court as in-house counsel, at a time of massive judicial legislation, is hardly the guy to rein it in. ‘It is like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop.’ The European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg: . Mr Mahoney was its registrar from 2001 to 2005, . and has written that the court can 'make new law' Mr Mahoney, an Oxford University-educated barrister, lectured in law at University College London for six years before practising at the bar in London during the 1970s. The other two candidates on the Government’s shortlist were Ben Emmerson QC, who represented Abu Qatada and is a founder of the Matrix Chambers where Cherie Blair is a member, and Raquel Agnello QC, an insolvency and pensions specialist. Mr Raab said: ‘I would have thought an insolvency expert is just what Europe needs right now.’ The list of contenders was drawn up the Ministry of Justice. There was disquiet at Westminster that Ken Clarke’s department had been unable to find a candidate with judicial experience in the UK which, bizarrely, is not a requirement for sitting in the ECHR. The final decision was taken by a vote of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a 318-strong collection of politicians from the Council of Europe’s 47 member countries.","Paul Mahoney has worked for the Council of Europe for more than 30 years, but has never before sat as a judge .

Searching on the internet for illnesses that match your symptoms can actually lead to more beneficial consultations with a GP, say researchers. A study found that patients who bring their own information to a doctor are listened to attentively by their GP and are able to build relationships with them. But despite the increasing popularity of home diagnosis, those involved in the survey said they still trusted their GP’s advice over what they found on the internet. Conversation: The study found that patients who bring their own information to a doctor are listened to attentively by their GP and are able to build relationships with them . The study, undertaken by University College London (UCL), asked 26 patients to discuss the negative and positive aspects of exploring their conditions online before seeing a doctor. The majority of respondents said that GPs often acknowledged their concerns and offered professional support. But some patients felt that their own research unearthed deficiencies in their doctor’s expertise and felt that they were ‘unwilling to admit their lack of knowledge’ and ‘disregarded the information’. Other patients suggested that the abundance of information online intimidated their doctors and said they worried that the doctor felt ‘undermined or threatened’. Professor Roger Jones, editor of the British Journal of General Practice, which is publishing the report, said that doctors are now often faced with informed patients because of the internet. Internet research: The study, undertaken by University College London, asked 26 patients to discuss the negative and positive aspects of exploring their conditions online before seeing a doctor . He said: ‘While this study is based on a relatively small number of patients, it is likely to be indicative of what most GPs are seeing in their consultations every day. 'Patients of all ages use the internet and many now attend their GP appointment with information that they have researched themselves' Professor Roger Jones, editor of the British Journal of General Practice . ‘Patients of all ages use the internet and many now attend their GP appointment with information that they have researched themselves.’ He added: ‘Whereas GPs might have been sceptical in the past, many are increasingly using this as a way of opening up the discussion and engaging patients, which can lead to a more productive consultation.’ Another study released earlier this year, however, found that one in four British women have misdiagnosed themselves on the internet - then bought the wrong product to try to cure their illness. The study, commissioned by feminine health brand Balance Activ, said: ‘Dr Google’ is now the first port of call for women with health concerns, but that online searches rarely provide an accurate diagnosis.'","Study: Patients who bring own research to doctor are listened to attentively .

"By . Sophie Borland Health Reporter, In San Diego . PUBLISHED: . 19:15 EST, 26 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:02 EST, 31 October 2012 . A blood test for pregnant women that can detect Down’s syndrome without the risk of miscarriage has been developed. It can be used in the ninth week of pregnancy – far earlier than existing methods – and  has so far proved to be 100 per cent accurate. Scientists believe the procedure could also prevent hundreds of unborn babies being lost through miscarriages. Safe: The new blood test can be used in the ninth week of pregnancy and has so far proved to be 100 per cent accurate . About 30,000 women deemed at high risk of carrying a Down’s baby face the dilemma of whether or not to undergo tests each year. Currently they are offered a nuchal fold test, which uses ultrasound screening to measure fluid at the back of the foetus’s neck at  11 weeks. Other existing methods for detecting the condition – which causes physical and learning disabilities and raises the risk of  heart disease – are amniocentesis, in which a needle is inserted into the womb to remove amniotic fluid, and chorionic villus sampling, whereby  a piece of placenta is taken for genetic testing. Infants with the condition have three copies of the Chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. However, the checks can cause miscarriage in between one in 100 and one in 200 cases. The U.S. scientists behind the new blood test hope that it will be  available on the NHS within the next five years. But they are also confident women will be able to pay for it privately even sooner, although a price has yet to be announced. The test works by looking at a normal sample of a woman’s blood taken from her arm and analysing the DNA of the foetus. This is present in a woman’s bloodstream just a few weeks into the pregnancy. Scientists then look for abnormalities in the baby’s chromosomes – sections of DNA – which  cause Down’s and other genetic disorders, including Turner syndrome and Klinefelter’s syndrome. At present, the screening  methods for detecting Down’s  and other conditions can be  highly unreliable. Many women undergoing the initial ultrasound are wrongly told their baby is healthy only to later discover it has a disorder. Scientists believe the test could prevent hundreds of unborn babies being lost through miscarriage . The new test has been designed by scientists from the genetic- testing firm Natera working  alongside academics from Colombia University, New York. Jonathan Sheena, chief technology officer at Natera, said: ‘At the moment pregnant women are presented with a really poor choice. ‘They can either undergo a safe but pretty unreliable test to tell if they are carrying a foetus with an abnormality. Or they can go through an uncomfortable, invasive and risky procedure. ‘What we’re trying to do is  give mothers the best information possible. We’re trying to eliminate surprise. We want pregnant  mothers to do whatever they can to prepare.’ Early trials of the test, which  were presented to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s conference in San Diego, show that it has been 100 per cent accurate. It has been tried on 263 women and in all cases was correctly able to detect any abnormalities. In recent years several other  groups of scientists have announced that they are also developing similar tests. But according to these researchers, this latest check is far more accurate. It can also look for twice as many abnormalities including genetic disorders that lead to learning difficulties. Women who discover their baby has one of these conditions will then be offered counselling. Depending on the condition, some may decide to undergo a termination.Presently around 1,100 cases of Down’s syndrome are diagnosed in pregnancy each year,  with around 90 per cent of women opting to have an abortion. For the test to be available on the NHS it would have to be approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the National Health Service’s rationing body. But the scientists are increasingly hopeful that it will be given the green light and will become  available for patients within the next five years.","The blood test can be used in the ninth week of pregnancy - far earlier than existing methods .

Theft: Roberts took a bag when he got in to the warehouse (file picture) A thief who burgled a factory returned to the scene of his crime just days later - when he turned up for a job interview. Robert Anthony Roberts was captured on CCTV leaving Elements Europe, based in Oswestry, Shropshire, with stolen goods. However he was recognised by one of the managers when he returned to the premises three days later as a candidate for a job there. He was arrested after the boss called police. Roberts, 28, pleaded guilty to burglary he appeared before magistrates in Shrewsbury. The court heard how, on March 12, Roberts entered the factory, on the Mile Oak Industrial Estate, as a trespasser. He gained access to a washroom and stole a rucksack containing a wallet, £30 cash and ID cards. When staff realised the items had been taken the firm’s production manager Nick Davies checked CCTV footage. It showed Roberts leaving the washroom with the rucksack accompanied by a Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog. John Barnett, prosecuting, said it was shortly after the burglary that Mr Davies had been carrying out job interviews at the firm. When he recognised one of the candidates as the man he had seen on CCTV footage he contacted the police. Roberts, of Newtown, Powys, Wales, admitted the burglary and told police he did it to feed his £40-a-day heroin addiction. Martin Rogerson, defending, said Roberts had suffered from an 'appalling heroin habit' which was so bad he had lost his job as a roofer working for his uncle. Caught: The burglar was recognised by a manager who saw him on CCTV . He added that, at that time, Roberts had been living in a room in Oswestry and had been walking around the industrial estate looking for work when he got into the room and helped himself to the bag. The court was also told that, since the burglary, Roberts had made efforts to turn his life around. Magistrates heard how, for the first time since childhood, the defendant had been reconciled with his father. Mr Rogerson added that Roberts had - with the support of his family - got himself clean of heroin by completing a self-detoxification programme at his father's home. While the ordeal had been a 'dreadful' experience for the defendant's family, Mr Rogerson added, it was one that had ultimately got Roberts clean of drugs. It emerged during the hearing that a warrant for Roberts' arrest was outstanding, relating to the non-payment of fines. The offence had resulted in Roberts being in breach of suspended sentence order which carries a 45-day custody sentence. However, Mr Rogerson argued that, having finally got clean of drugs and now living and working with his father in a supportive stable environment, prison would be the worst place Roberts could be sent. Magistrates allowed Roberts’ suspended sentence order to continue, but ordered him complete a 12-month community order, with 40 hours of unpaid work, £85 costs and £63 compensation.","Heroin addict was captured on CCTV leaving the premises with stolen goods .

Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino has broken his silence in a controversial TV interview and described the cruise ship disaster which cost 32 lives as a 'banal accident' adding that he did not believe it was 'a crime'. Schettino, 52, is said to have been paid £55,000 for the interview which was broadcast on Italian television late on Wednesday night and the channel which broadcast it was bombarded with complaints after details of the fee emerged - although it has denied handing over any cash. Amazingly he even described himself as 'a victim' claiming that at the time of the incident he was not in charge - although at the end of the hour long interview, he did eventually apologise for the tragedy earlier this year when the Costa Concordia struck a rock and sank off the island of Giglio. Italian television channel Canale 5 was bombarded with complaints following reports it paid Schettino £55,000 for the hour-long interview . The luxury liner had left port two hours before the disaster for a week long Mediterranean cruise and was packed with more than 4,000 passengers and crew, including 30 Britons. It struck a rock which was marked on charts after Schettino ordered a 'sail by salute' and came too close to Giglio. As a result a 70 metre gash was torn in the hull of the Concordia and despite water pouring into the hold Schettino delayed giving the order to abandon ship for more than an hour. He is currently accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship after it emerged he had fled the bridge and escaped on a lifeboat while dozens of passengers and crew were still onboard the 290m long Costa Concordia. In his interview on Canale 5, owned by controversial former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, Schettino said: 'This was a banal accident in which fate found a hole right in the interaction of human beings. 'I think that as a result, a misunderstanding was created and that's why there is all this anger. 'It's as if everyone's head - just like the instruments onboard - went into a blackout. At that moment I had gone onto the bridge and given the order for manual navigation and I was not in charge, the navigation was in the hands of another officer.' Schettino said he blamed himself for being distracted by a telephone call, adding that a 'divine hand' had then guided him saying: 'I realised that something was wrong when I spotted wash and I managed to avoid a full head on collision with the rock.' Schettino has insisted the rock was not on charts and instruments had failed then bizarrely added: 'There is a difference between a sail by salute and a sail, when you perform a sail by salute you slow down and you sail close and you chose the right charts so you know how far you are aware from land. 'If a proper sail by salute had been had been planned then nothing would have happened.' Holiday makers soak up the sun in the shadow of the wrecked Costa Concordia near the harbour of Giglio Porto, where the salvage operation is still underway six months after the disaster . Schettino again insisted that turning the Concordia around and heading back towards Giglio, instead of giving the order to abandon ship immediately, saved lives - although coastguards and maritime experts have contradicted his decision saying that by the time the evacuation was sounded it was listing too much and lifeboats could not be launched properly. Schettino, who was dubbed Captain Coward after he claimed to have 'tripped and fell' into a lifeboat, faces a possible jail sentence of more than 2,500 years, and added: 'I think about prison but at the same time you have to understand ""I did this so I deserve it"" but I don't think a nautical accident is a crime. I don't think I committed a crime. 'That night I made choices as a captain and I still feel a captain. I just want the truth to emerge - whatever it is.' When asked if he felt he should apologise Schettino, who was sweating profusely and had a noticeable tic, said: 'It's normal that I should say sorry as a representative of the system, to everybody. I never thought anything like this could have happened. 'My condolences and deepest sympathies are with the people who are no more, there has been a financial loss, the company and people have been affected, the captain of the ship has also been a victim of all this system but it is all insignificant compared to a mother losing her child. 'That is immeasurable but also for a captain to lose a ship is a pain that cannot be measured.' Schettino also hit out at crew members who had accused him of having relationship with onboard hostess Domnica Cemortan and said: 'We had dinner that night. She is a friend of mine. She is a very sociable person, very nice, a friend to everyone, she is not anything else. 'At the time of the incident she was outside the bridge, she was waiting for her cabin to be prepared and then I would have given her the key.' More than 4,000 crew and passengers were on board the Costa Concordia when disaster struck in January this year, a total of 32 lives were lost . When asked why he had abandoned the ship and refused coastguard commander Gregorio De Falco's repeated demands to go back on board he replied: 'As a captain I have never given an order that could not be obeyed, he asked me to do something that could not be done. 'The thing is that at that moment he had not thought about the fact that the ship was submerged on its right side, that I would have had to swim 300 metres, that is to say throw myself in the sea and try and keep my mobile dry because I was coordinating the rescue which was far more important. 'I never saw any one drown. A coward is someone who in a dangerous situation tries to take advantage. If I had known that the conversation we were having was going to be released the tone would have been different.' Following his interview the website of the show, Quinta Colonna, was bombarded with angry comments towards Schettino. One read: 'I was on the ship that night with two children and they didn't let me onto a lifeboat. Schettino and most of the crew deserve nothing.' Another read: 'Schettino you are a coward. A captain never abandons ship. Shame on you', while others hit out at the payment he was given saying he should donate it to the families of the victims. Schettino, from Meta di Sorrento near Naples, was freed from house arrest earlier this month after a judge ordered him to stay there following the disaster on 13 January and a pre trial hearing is due to take place on 21 July.

"By . Richard Shears . PUBLISHED: . 17:17 EST, 12 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:29 EST, 12 July 2012 . Down on his luck: Former England cricketer Adam Hollioake has appeared in an Australian court this week over £14m debts from a disastrous property venture . Twelve years ago he was  captain of the England one-day cricket team. But this week, after a spectacular fall from grace, Adam Hollioake was in court over £14million debts from a disastrous property venture. Now bankrupt, the 40-year-old has even taken up cage fighting in an attempt to scrape some money together. Bemoaning his downfall, he said of his wife, Sherryn: ‘When we married I was captain of England, good looking, plenty of money, not a care in the world. Now she is married to a fat old guy, not good looking any more, and no money.’ Hollioake gave up cricket and returned to Australia, where he was born, to go into business in 2004. But last year he was declared bankrupt, and this week he appeared in court to confirm how much money is owed to each of his 40 creditors. In an interview with the Daily Mail after his court appearance, he said: ‘Those who grumble about losing some of their money have lost nothing against what I lost, which is everything. ‘But you know, there is one thing that no one can take away from me. And that is the love of my wife Sherryn and my three beautiful kids. That along with my health. Health and a wife’s love are far more precious than money.’ He added: ‘Cage fighting doesn’t pay all that well. It hurts, physically, at times, but I haven’t got my head knocked off yet. ‘But boy, do they love to boo me when I go into the ring. I’m a traitor to the Aussies, after all, having been born here and then ending up in the UK playing cricket for England. I’m less popular than the taxman.’ Hollioake captained Surrey between 1997 and 2003, winning three County Championships, and led the England team in one-day internationals. He also represented his country in Test matches. His brother Ben, also a cricketer, died in a car accident in 2002. Hollioake then retired after his father, John, suggested he could receive a salary of around £100,000 a year if he joined him in a property development company. In the ring: Hollioake has taken part in cage fighting in an attempt to scrape from money together, but say it hurts physically and doesn't pay that well . Hollioake had doubled his money on a house sale in 1994 and believed he could do it again. ‘I was a genius – or so I thought,’ he said. The venture soon turned sour. From living a life of luxury, with more than one home on each side of the Australian continent, he and his family now own no property and are renting. Hollioake said: ‘The lawyers representing the creditors  in court yesterday wanted to know where every cent had gone and it was not a pleasant experience. They wanted to know everything about my life, almost down to how many times I went to the toilet.’ Love: Hollioake, pictured with his wife Sherryn in 2001. He has said his wife's love is far more precious than money during an interview with the Mail . Since his bankruptcy, he said, attempts had been made ‘by enemies’ to paint him as a criminal, but he insisted: ‘I’m no crook. My life is an open book.’ He opened his wallet and added: ‘This is all I have left – just a few dollars. Yet there have been claims that I’ve ripped people off, run away with their money, got it all tucked away, secretly loaded myself up. ‘The truth is, I’ve been left with nothing. Nothing, that is, except the devotion of my wife, Sherryn, and the love of my kids.’ He said he was a victim of the global financial crisis, adding: ‘What happened was mostly out of my hands, although I accept that I did not apply the same professionalism in my business affairs as I did in my cricket.’ He now admits that he made a ‘massive error’. His firm was liquidated in September 2010. Among his creditors is former England and Surrey teammate Alec Stewart, whose claim is estimated to be more than £400,000. ‘Alec understands the position I got myself into, as do the other creditors, apart from one who is determined to stamp me into the ground,’ Hollioake said. ‘There was another man I went into business with when I managed to get a TV show up and running on Channel Nine here in Australia. ‘Things didn’t go well between us – he ended up alienating my friends and business associates. Finally he tried to remove my wife as a director. I had to take him to court to put him back in his box. ‘But even though the court found in my favour and removed him from the directorship he in his anger accused me of stealing money.’ Hollioake showed the Mail a copy of a police search warrant which he said suggested he had indeed stolen cash. ‘Why else would the police want to draw up a search warrant?’ he said. Heyday: Hollioake practices his bowling for an England match in Australia during 2002. He representing the country in both test matches and one day internationals . Royal meeting: Hollioake is given the county championship trophy by the Duke of Edinburgh after his county Surrey's victory in 2002 . ‘However, there is one problem with this document. It wasn’t signed, never executed. It was printed up as a result of a complaint by one of those working against me and of course the police had to get things rolling, but it didn’t get anywhere.’ Hollioake’s determination to fight the damage to his reputation was not helped when it was revealed that he had tried to leave the country without the permission of his bankruptcy trustee, and had been stopped by Australian Federal Police. ‘In fact, I had no idea I wasn’t allowed to leave after being declared bankrupt,’ he said. ‘I was actually on my way to Papua New Guinea to do some charity work, but when it was pointed out to me that travel was not allowed without explicit permission I realised I had made an innocent error.’ He added: ‘In two years I’ll be free of bankruptcy and the first thing I plan to do is to shake the hands of people who have lost money through my property ventures. ‘I am trying to establish whether I am legally entitled to try to pay them back after I  have been dismissed from bankruptcy but either way I feel very badly about what has happened and I hope that I can clear  the air with those creditors one way or the other.’","Adam Hollioake has taken to cage fighting to try and make money .

A British powerboat racer has been killed after his boat flipped and 'barrel rolled' at speeds of 120mph. William Nocker was competing in the first race of the inaugural Gabon Grand Prix in west Africa when the accident happened. The 47-year-old was rushed to a military hospital in Gabon's capital city Libreville but doctors were unable to resuscitate him. His co-driver, Norwegian Kurt Olsen, was also badly hurt and remains in a critical condition in intensive care. Witnesses said Mr Nocker's boat hit two waves and turned over. He had just returned to the sport following a five-year ban for tampering with a competitor's fuel supply. A tribunal upheld charges of gross . misconduct and unsportsmanlike behaviour against Mr Nocker and fellow . racer Rob Lister after it was alleged water was poured into the tank of a . rival boat during the Liverpool Powerboat Grand Prix in 2006. Race promoters H20 Racing said contact had been made with Mr Nocker's father Bill and brother James following the accident. Mr Nocker, originally from Tiverton, Devon, was racing for the Welmax Offshore Racing team. The race - the second round of the Class 1 world offshore championship - was immediately stopped following the accident as safety teams rushed to attend to the injured crew at the scene. As a mark of respect organisers cancelled the next day's second round before abandoning the event completely. The sport's governing body, Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM), has launched an investigation into the cause of the crash and plans to inspect the boat's wreckage.

Dramatic footage of the moment five chimpanzees broke out of their enclosure and wandered among terrified visitors at a German zoo has emerged. The primates mingled with 2,500 tourists thronging Experience Zoo in Hanover last week after escaping from their compound using a ladder they had fashioned together out of tree branches. But while the chimps were content to taste life on the other side of the fence, a five-year-old girl and an an elderly man were hurt in the panic as staff hurriedly evacuated the park. Scroll down for video . Close encounter: A visitor to Experience Zoo in Hanover, Germany, is astonished to be greeted by a friendly chimpanzee, one of five to escape their enclosure, last week . On the prowl: A primate mingles among the 2,500 tourists thronging the popular zoo . The moment shocked visitors were confronted by the apes was captured by visitor Kai Hauser, 34, on his mobile phone. Mr Hauser, who runs and electronic skateboard company, recorded several unexpected interactions between the chimps and startled tourists. He was walking with his girlfriend and her sister's family towards an area called 'Gorillas Hills' when they heard some strange noises. Mr Hauser said: 'Suddenly we heard very loud screaming and noises from apes, like ""Uh uh, ah ah"" through the bushes. 'Nobody saw anything, only the loud screaming from the chimps came through the bushes so it was frightening and everyone on the way stopped walking and was looking around with open mouths. 'Then we heard a women behind the bushes shouting, ""Oh no! Stop, come back."" 'A few seconds later one chimp came around the corner - he was very relaxed and walked up to a man and gave him a hug. 'The chimp looked like he wanted to kiss him... but then he opened his mouth revealing his big teeth and we feared he could bite his chin off.' Stand-off: A family stands still as one of the apes ponders his next move . On his way: The family breathes a sigh of relief as the primate walks away . Much to everyone's relief the chimp let go of the man and walked off, Mr Hauser said. Further footage shows a father holding his daughters' hands as a chimp approaches. There then follows a brief stand-off before the chimp simply walks away. Mr Hauser said: 'Other chimps made their way to the place I was filming. I can't be sure but I think it was three or four different ones that are seen in the clips I filmed. 'My friend took the children and fled to the souvenir shop where they locked the doors to gave the visitors a safe place to hide.' In the footage, some people can be heard nervously laughing as the apes walked through the park. Mr Hauser said: 'It was a mixture between being stunned and scared and excited. Nobody knew if it was dangerous or not so everyone tried to not attract the attention of the chimps. 'The chimps were unpredictable and they showed unmistakably that they were the bosses and this was now their district.' Watch your back: An escaped chimpanzee strolls among many young guests . The chimps scaled the walls of their enclosure (left) using a makeshift ladder. Visitor Kai Hauser recorded the zoo-break on his mobile phone . All gone: The chimp's enclosure, meanwhile, sat empty as feeding time came and went . The final part of the video shows authorities escorting panicked visitors from the park. 'We stayed 15 minutes in the souvenir shop until the keepers guided all visitors out of the zoo,' Mr Hauser said. 'As . we left the zoo you could here the sirens of the police, fire brigade, . ambulances. Police surrounded the zoo with the advice to shoot the . chimps if they passed the zoo fences.' Some 27 police cars raced to the scene . to help steer the animals, which are often aggressive, extremely strong . and capable of killing a human in seconds. They were joined by zookeepers armed with pepper spray. A five-year-old girl hurt herself when she fell over at the sight of them but was not seriously injured. An . elderly man also needed medical attention when he was locked in the . tropical house in 100 degree heat as the chimps roamed outside. Emergency: Guests were hurried to exits for fear one of the escaped chimps might attack a human . Planning their escape? The mischievous chimps photographed the week before their adventure over the wall . Four of the five chimps - seven in total live in the enclosure - tasted freedom and decided they didn’t like it much. They wandered back to the enclosure on their own - but leader of the pack Maxi was enjoying himself on the outside. 'He took himself off to see the head gorilla,' said zoo spokesman Simone Hagenmeyer. 'He was a bit harder to coax back. He’s getting on a bit so we gave him a ladder to climb back into the enclosure.' An inquiry is now underway to determine what happened. The zoo could be faced with a huge bill for the fleet of police, ambulances and fire engines that raced to the scene.","Visitor Kai Hauser, 34, filmed footage of the apes running amok at Experience Zoo in Hanover last week on his mobile phone ."

A £1 billion order for super-fast bullet trains in the UK will be made in Japan in what critics will call a missed opportunity for British industry. The Government is set to announce the deal which will see the First Great Western rail firm bring 500 carriages into service here by 2016. Despite the huge size of the deal, it is expected to only create 500 British jobs with the majority of construction to be done by company Hitachi in Japan. On their way: Bullet trains are a major form of transport in Japan (pictured) and they're coming here with a £1 billion order for 500 carriages expected by 2016 . Critics, including the rail union RMT, will argue that a British company should have insisted the entire fleet be built here to create more UK jobs. The Government will argue that this is the best deal for taxpayers as Hitachi offered the best price and most competitive tender. Sources at the Department for Transport confirmed the order was ‘in the very final stages of negotiation’ and an announcement was expected before the start of the Olympics. Called the Intercity Express Project, the bullet trains will provide extra seating to ease overcrowding, will be faster and are electric and so are more environmentally friendly. Hitachi will build the shells of the trains at its factory in Kasado, near Hiroshima in Japan before they are shipped to the UK where they will be assembled before going into service. Hitachi says the trains shells must . be built in Japan because they use unique technology which would be too . expensive to transfer here for the order. But should the company win more orders it might be possible to build entire trains in the UK. Bullets at St Pancras: The new bullet trains will be similar to the Javelin trains which run from Kent to St Pancras (pictured) Hitachi General Manager Kentaro Masai said: ‘It will be an honour to build these trains. ‘They will have Japanese technology that will make them safe and reliable. ‘We will also use our technology to give passengers a smooth ride. ‘At Hitachi we deliver what we say and these trains will be a good addition to the UK network.’ Once brought to the UK, the trains will be assembled in a new plant in north east England, creating an estimated 500 jobs. New maintenance depots will also operate in London, Bristol and Wales. The carriages, which will be similar to the new high speed Javelin trains in Kent, will replace 125 trains which were introduced in the 1970s by British Rail as the new ‘age of the train’ made famous by a TV advert fronted by Jimmy Saville. They will run from Paddington to Bristol and Cardiff, stopping at Reading, Swindon, Newbury, Didcot and Banbury stations. Aluminium lengths 26 metres long will be welded together to make the trains safer in a crash, Hitachi said. They will also have the latest state-of-the-art electrics but interiors are to be decided by the train operator. Bullet trains have become world famous for their aerodynamic long nosed which allows them to travel as fast as 225 mph.","A £1 billion order of bullet trains for the UK are to be made mostly in Japan .

Britain's washout summer has been blamed on melting Arctic sea ice, as forecasters warned that the torrential downpours and thunder would continue for the rest of the month. The soggiest June since records began has been followed by an equally miserable July, as parts of the UK experienced the average rainfall for the month in just . 10 days. Academics said that layers of melting sea ice across the Arctic Ocean are partly to blame for the relentless rain, as they've pushed cold plumes of air much further south than usual for this time of year. Making a splash: A pair of ice cream vans struggle to drive through the flooded streets of Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, as the north took a battering from the wet weather .

All hands to the pump: Emergency crews took drastic measures to pump out the 3ft of water which had submerged Croscombe today . Making the best of it: Workers at the Farnborough International Airshow seemed in good spirits yesterday despite the relentless downpours . The Arctic sea ice began melting at a . rapid rate in line with the UK's run of dismal summers, leading many to . question the effect of climate change on long-term weather patterns. Despite the woeful conditions nationwide, however, many Britons soldiered on through the floods and showed admirable battling spirit. In Croscombe, Somerset, two ice cream vans were spotted ploughing merrily through flood waters despite the small village being devastated by 3ft-deep swatches of floodwater. The claims from academics came as the Met Office today gave a bleak outlook for the rest of the month, as more unsettled weather it predicted. No go: Fire crews arrive on the scene in Croscombe today to pump out the huge volumes of water in the village . Overflowing: Flood water laps up against a house in Croscombe, one of the areas in the south west worst affected by the deluge . A spokesperson said that until the end of July there will be mostly unsettle patches of rainfall, interspersed only occasionally with sunshine. Weather experts said up to 15mm of . rain could fall in an hour in some places as the period of unseasonably . wet weather that has brought flooding up and down the country continues. The Environment Agency (EA) today has five . flood warnings in place - three in the South West and two in the Midlands - and 26 . flood alerts in place across England.

Olympic effort: The crowds gathered and so did the clouds at Windsor . Castle yesterday as the Olympic Torch was carried through an almighty . downpour . Bleak: Forecasters have predicted that as well as widespread rain today, wet weather will last beyond Friday . London 2012 bosses making contingency plans for the wet weather have ordered 250,000 ponchos to hand out to spectators during the Games. Olympic organisers made the move to battle the effects of downpours and thunderstorms on fans and athletes later this month. Several of the events, including volleyball at Horse Guards Parade and eventing at Greenwich Park, are in temporary venues completely exposed to the elements. The Olympic Stadium, meanwhile, is only two-thirds covered by a roof. Even those who paid top prices for the best seats in the house could find themselves getting a soaking if the heavens open during the opening ceremony or during events. Sports minister Hugh Robertson has said the government has been assured that most of the Olympic venues are 'reasonably waterproof'. A LOCOG spokesperson told MailOnline: 'People in the UK are used to watching sport in good and bad weather. 'Wet weather clothing will be available for spectators to buy if they come unprepared.' The Met Office today joined university academics in citing melting sea ice as a possible factor affecting Britain's weather. Dan Williams, Met Office spokesperson, . said that although they are mainly attributing the rain to 'natural . variability', sea ice being at record low levels for this time of year . was also affecting weather patterns. Jet streams of fast-moving wind have also been blamed for the constant downpours, causing the blankets of low pressure which lead to rain. Matt Dobson, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said earlier this week: 'Our weather is really stuck in a rut because the jet stream is further south than it should be at this time of the year – over France and northern Spain – and we are under a blanket of low pressure on the northern side of it. Mr Dobson said that heavy rain will also sweep through the UK from the south west on Thursday. Large parts of the region were already battling horrendous conditions, including the residents of Croscombe, where 3ft of water submerged the centre of the small Somerset village. Further north, places like Hebden Bridge in Yorkshire, which has already been pounded by relentless flooding, continue to struggle under the deluge of water. While the Met Office has issued an . amber warning of rain for south-eastern areas of Scotland and yellow . warnings across large swathes of southern and northern England. A spokesman said: 'The public should be prepared for the likelihood of localised flooding, particularly in the amber area.' Gemma . Plumb, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, warned that bursts of torrential . rain could fall on already saturated ground, increasing the chances of . flooding. She said: 'Scotland and northern England . will see spells of heavy, persistent rain today and there are . indications that there could be some torrential, thundery outbreaks. 'Elsewhere there will be showers, which could be persistent and heavy in some areas especially across southern and easterly parts of England.' Forecasters predicted rainfall totals of around 20-30mm, but said double that amount could fall in local areas. Ms Plumb said a further band of heavy, persistent rain will move in from the South West during tomorrow, increasing the flooding threat. More showers are expected in England and Wales on Friday. 'The rain is falling on already saturated ground and river catchments are already at very high levels so further problems are to be expected,' she added. Sunday could provide some respite from the rain with drier spells forecast. Showers hit most parts of the UK . yesterday, causing problems to the transport network and public events, . including the England cricket match in Manchester. The A35 in Dorset, which was shut due to flooding, remained closed in both directions between the A37 and A3066 this morning. One of the country's largest agricultural shows was also cancelled after just a day because of the appalling weather. The . annual Great Yorkshire Show in Harrogate began yesterday and was due to . run until tomorrow but organisers decided to pull the plug last night. Not stopping: Residents of Hebden Bridge have not seen the back of the wet weather yet after the downpours continued this week . More on the way: Heavy rain continued to fall on an already sodden Hebden Bridge yesterday . British winemakers are bracing themselves for a poor crop as the washout summer has decimated flowering vines. Sussex was faced with 141mm of rain during the wettest June on record and winemakers are concerned for this year's harvest. Vines flower before turning into fruit, which ripens before being harvested in October. But this year's flowering season has been delayed due to heavy rain, and the Met Office is forecasting continued bad weather next week during a crucial period for winemaking. Roy Cook, who runs Sedlescombe Organic Wines in Robertsbridge, East Sussex, said: 'If it rains a lot during this period we end up with a poor fruit. 'The flowers will just not turn to fruit. Some varieties are more prone than others but it means the yield will be much reduced - the total could be just a tenth of what it could be in a good year. 'You have a decreased quantity to sell and it does cause problems with cash flow.' Peter Hall has run Breaky Bottom Vineyard near Lewes, East Sussex, for 38 years. He said: 'I've had at least 34 cropping years and it would be foolish to deny this will not be one of the more difficult ones. 'I am nervous for the wellbeing of the national crop. This year is unlikely to produce a yield equal to previous ones. In 2011 a hard winter, mild spring and late heatwave helped to produce three million bottles of English wine but next year's vintage is expected to be substantially lower. Julia Trustam Eve spokesman for English Wine Producers said: 'For the next ten days or so wine producers will have to keep an eye out. 'It's still early days and there won't be too many people willing to make a call on what will happen just yet.'","Five flood warnings still in place across UK, along with 26 flood alerts .

But while the immediate risk to his safety may have been obvious, it was an unseen danger which cost him dear in the end – a man with a camera in the next door garden. Mr Holland, 53, has been landed with a £6,000 bill after the neighbour took a picture of him and reported him and his colleague to  the authorities. The furious gardener claims the fee is far too high, but health and safety bosses insist it was ‘sheer good fortune’ that he did not hurt himself or anyone else. Dangerous: John Holland was reported to the Health and Safety Executive after a neighbour trained in assessing chainsaw work saw him up this tree . Mr Holland was working in  Deeping St . James, Lincolnshire, when he was spotted by a local resident balancing . at the top of a 20ft tree. Without wearing the necessary . protective clothing or using safety ropes, he had scaled the tree using a . ladder which was wider than the trunk. Once at the top, Mr Holland wrapped . one arm around the trunk and balanced with one foot on a branch and the . other on the ladder. In his left hand he can be seen holding a chainsaw.

HSE inspector Neil Ward said it was 'sheer good fortune' that no one was hurt when Mr Holland was using the chainsaw, similar to the one pictured .

Three teenagers have drowned after getting into difficulties in rivers and a quarry during the heatwave. The series of accidents at the start of the school holidays has led to warnings for children to stay away from dangerous locations. Last night the body of a 14-year-old boy was recovered by police divers from a waterlogged quarry in Dudley, West Midlands. The teenager, named locally as Augusto Zacarias, had gone missing earlier in the afternoon. The tragedy follows the deaths of two boys on Tuesday in separate incidents. Victims: Aaron Burgess (left) died while cooling off in the River Avon near Bristol and Daniel McCullagh drowned in the River Nene near Woodford in Northamptonshire . Aaron Burgess, 14, died while cooling off in the River Avon near Bristol, while Daniel McCullagh, 15, died in the River Nene near Woodford in Northamptonshire. Augusto is believed to have been sunbathing with friends at a site known locally as the ‘blue lagoon’, when he fell into the 20ft deep water. Police found his body shortly before 8.30pm. Friends had already set up an online tribute page while police dredged the pool for him. Grief: Aaron Burgess's father Jay kneels to read tributes near the site where his son's body was found . One friend, Chloe Stone, wrote: ‘Such a shame, rest in peace sweetie, be sadly missed, always in our hearts.’ Earlier, the father of Aaron Burgess paid tribute to his ‘chip off the old block’. Tribute: Jay Burgess said his son Aaron was a 'chip off the old block' Jay Burgess said his son was ‘always acting the fool’, adding that Aaron was ‘beautiful’. Mr Burgess, of Longwell Green, near Bristol, was joined on the banks of the Avon by more than 50 of his son’s friends, who laid flowers and held a candlelit vigil. Aaron had been sliding down a weir when he disappeared beneath the water at around 5.40pm. Police divers recovered his body six hours later. Earlier on Tuesday, Daniel McCullagh had got into difficulties after jumping into the River Nene at around 3pm. His friends tried to save him when his body slipped under the water, but he was swept away by the strong current. Rescue crews found his body just over three hours later, almost half a mile away from where he disappeared. Daniel’s father Gabriel last night described him as a ‘lovely, funny lad who just wanted to fit in and have loads of friends’. He put a message on Facebook thanking people for their kind words and saying that he and Daniel’s mother were ‘heartbroken’. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents yesterday urged people to stay away from rivers, quarries and lakes and instead head to beaches, lidos and swimming pools. David Walker, head of leisure safety at RoSPA, said: ‘Among the hazards to consider at inland waters are that, even on a hot day, water might be a lot colder than you were expecting and there may be strong currents and underwater debris that you can’t see from the bank. ‘Consider how you are going to get out of the water before you get in, and be honest about your ability to look after yourself.’ Swept away: The scene at Woodford Lock, Northamptonshire, where Daniel McCullagh's body was removed from the River Nene .

A speedboat driver drowned in the River Thames last night after the vessel capsized when three men took it for a high-speed test run. Police divers were tonight trawling the murky water for the man's body after the tragedy which happened near the spot where two men drowned last year. The man's father told bystanders that his son, who was apparently not wearing a lifejacket, could not swim. High-speed horror: The driver of this sunken speedboat drowned in the River Thames at Shepperton, Surrey, after it flipped over when he and two other men took it out for a test run following repairs . 'Thrown out': The 12ft fibreglass boat is believed to have capsized when the driver accelerated on a bend . His friend, who had been tipped into the river with another man, managed to keep his head above water but had to let go as the strong currents threatened to drag them both under. Rescuers pulled the sunken speedboat to the river bank so police could examine it. The drama happened as the three men revved up the 12ft fibreglass speedboat during a test-run on the Thames at Shepperton, Surrey last night, following repairs. Witnesses on the idyllic stretch of the river spoke of the small craft passing their moored boats at speed, before they asked the driver to slow down. As he reached a bend further on, the man was believed to have opened the throttle on the powerboat. Trawling the waters: A police diver drops into the Thames in search of the body of the driver, who was not thought to have been wearing a life jacket . Pleasure boater Jim McCutcheon said: 'The current was very, very strong indeed when I saw a speedboat came up here with three men in it. 'They were going at speed. I told them to ease off because they were coming through a mooring and the skipper said ""just testing"" because they had done some repairs to the engine and were giving it a trial run. 'He did slow down and went through nice and slow and I remember saying: ""You wait until he gets to the bend. He’ll open her up - and he did. 'Unfortunately, I think they were to one side and they were thrown out.' He said throttling up while turning into a strong current would have been like turning into a brick wall. 'That’s the mistake,' he said. 'The biggest mistake of the day was nobody was wearing lifejackets.' He added that he and other boaters had learned the man’s father had arrived at the scene from his home in the New Forest, Hampshire, at around 10pm last night. 'He had a word with a woman,' said Mr McCutcheon. 'He was in a terrible state. He told her his son couldn’t swim.' Tragic: The victim's friend held his head above water, but had to let go as strong currents threatened to pull both of them under . David Green, a local boat builder, was carrying out repairs to his vessel near the scene and had also been passed by the boat. He said: 'It was just a little speedboat, about 12ft. I think if went over because they were all sitting on one edge and the river’s been running really strongly lately. 'I didn’t take much notice when they went past because so many people go above the speed limit because it’s just four knots here. 'It happens because people get big engines and they want to see how fast the boat can go.' He said the first he knew something was wrong was when he heard shouting and looked over to see an upturned hull. 'I just thought it was a sailing dinghy,' he said. 'The (missing) guy’s mate had him in the water. He was holding him up but he had to let go because he couldn’t hold him any longer.' Witness David Green . He added: 'The other one had swum to the other bank. He started shouting and freaking out and saying he was in shock but what can you do? The river’s so strong.' He said that man was rescued by the fire service, who deployed their boat and used specialist underwater equipment to search for the missing man. The other survivor was helped by a group of youths, who took a lifebelt from its stand and threw it to him, before pulling him from the water. Mr Green was one of several people to comment on the fact that the trio were not properly kitted out. 'If they had been wearing life jackets the guy would still be alive. I think it should be mandatory.' Dog walker Duncan Macduff, 38, from Shepperton, was at the scene minutes after the accident. He said it was common for speedboats to throttle up as they rounded the corner. I’ve seen it happen a few times here, he said. 'When they get to the corner they open up round the bend.' Police divers were sent into the water and also used a camera on a pole to search the upturned boat and the banks and river bed. Meanwhile, a police helicopter with a thermal imaging camera hunted for any signs of body heat along the stretch of river. A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'Surrey Police was called to Russell Road in Shepperton at just before 6pm yesterday to reports that a boat had capsized and three people had fallen into the River Thames. 'Officers attended the scene where a teenage boy and a man in his 40s had managed to get to safety, however a third person, a man believed to be in his 40s is still missing.' The trio were believed to have taken to the water in their boat in nearby Walton-on-Thames. Music executive Keith Lowde and Dr Rex Walford drowned in the River Thames at Shepperton in January last year as Mr Lowde was ferrying himself and five friends from a river island dinner party at his home to the shore in pitch darkness.","Boat believed to have flipped over when driver opened throttle on bend .

Sat side-by-side and perched on a fence, five young men with unkempt hair and wearing serious expressions stare into the camera. The year was 1982 and the photo was taken on a self-timed camera during a vacation at Copco Lake in northern California. The men in the picture - John Wardlaw, Mark Rumer, Dallas Burney, John Molony, John Dickson - were high school friends from Santa Barbara, California, who at just 19 had their whole lives ahead of them. 1982: Fresh out of high school, friends (from left to right) John Wardlaw, Mark Rumer, Dallas Burney, John Molony, John Dickson take an impromptu photo while on holiday at Copco Lake in northern California . 1987: Five years later and the men decide to recreate their 1982 photo by adopting a similar pose . 1992: Now approaching 30, the men again strike a similar pose as they establish a five-yearly tradition . Little did they know that they would be taking that exact same photo once every five years for the next three decades. But that's what happened, and the six . follow-up photos are testament to the strong bond of friendship as the . five men's appearances slowly change over the years. The original July 1982 image featured three of the men - all called John - topless in the summer sun. But what sets it apart from other . holiday pictures is the empty coffee jar held by Mr Molony. It contained . a cockroach that the friends had decided to keep as a pet. Mr Wardlaw told CNN: 'For some . reason, we all chose to have dark and mysterious expressions on our . faces. I'm sure we all thought we were being really cool. 'Priorities were so different back then. All I was really thinking about was summer and girls.' 1997: The friends take their photo from a slightly different angle . 2002: Wearing solemn expressions, they seem keen to recreate the atmosphere of the original photo . 2007: The men celebrate the 25th anniversary of the original photo by keeping their tradition alive . 2012: Fast approaching 50, the friends this year celebrated Mr Dickson's (right) upcoming nuptials . Over the next few years, the men - all now at university - continued to make annual pilgrimages to Copco Lake. But it wasn't until 1987 that Mr Wardlaw, a photography enthusiast, decided the friends should try and recreate the 1982 photo. So the men sat in the same order, . adopted the same poses and expressions as they had done five years . earlier, and took a replica image again using a self-timed camera. The only noticeable differences are the men's late-80s hairstyles and a slightly different jar that contained no cockroach. Mr Wardlaw said: 'I think I had a . feeling this might become some cool tradition, but I had no idea we . would still be doing it for 30 years.' Group photo: Taking the picture has become more sophisticated in recent years, with the men desperate for it to turn out as accurate as possible to the 1982 original . Blow-ups: The men pose with large versions of their 1982 and 1987 group photos . In the more recent images, the men have become increasingly particular about replicating the details of the original photo. So some have opted to wear the same clothes, while an 'official' jar and hat have been selected to use every five years. Although the men, now approaching 50, live separate lives, they always gather for their five-yearly vacation to Copco Lake. Over the years, they have been guest at each others' weddings and some have moved out of California. Mr Dickson work as a restaurant . columnist and got married this month - in June, the five friends turned . their get-together into a stag celebration. Mr Wardlaw works in photography and . film; Mr Burney is a teacher; Mr Molony works for UPS, is married and . moved to New Orleans, Louisiana; and Mr Rumer is retired and lives in . Oregon. None of the men has children.","In 1982, John Wardlaw, Mark Rumer, Dallas Burney, John Molony, John Dickson were high school friends from Santa Barbara, California .

The head coach for South Korean’s Olympic sailing team has been sent home in disgrace after he was caught drink-driving. Jae-Cheol Lee, 38, had spent Tuesday evening drinking wine at a welcome party in Weymouth, Dorset, which is hosting all sailing events for the games. Following the function he carried on drinking with other sailing coaches before returning to South Korea’s accommodation at the Olympic Village on Portland at midnight. Going home: South Korea sailing coach Jae-Cheol Lee spent Tuesday evening drinking wine at a welcome party in Weymouth, Dorset, (pictured) which is hosting all sailing events for the games . At 5am he climbed into his MG6 coupe and was spotted by police veering across the road close to the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy. A breath test showed he was more than twice the drink drive limit and Lee was fined and banned from driving for 18 months by magistrates in Weymouth. Hours later the South Korean Olympic delegation in London held an emergency disciplinary committee and decided to send the coach back to Seoul. It was reported that the delegation believed Lee’s ‘reprehensible act’ would have had an adverse effect on the ‘honor and morale’ of the national team. Not the best way to fly the South Korea flag: Lee was ordered to pay a fine and costs totalling £340 and was banned from driving in the UK for 18 months . Julian Lawrence, prosecuting, told magistrates that Lee’s manner of driving had aroused interest in the police. He said: 'Though it was still dark the car’s headlights were not on and as police followed it they saw the vehicle was veering towards the road’s central white line. 'That gave them cause for concern.' He said Lee had been on his own in the car and appeared unsteady on his feet when he got out of the vehicle. Olympic sailing explained: The events start on July 29 and carry on until August 11 . Simon Lacey, defending, told the court: 'Lee had been to a welcome party where he had a few glasses of wine and then, with other coaches he’d met there, had gone for further drinks. 'Around midnight Lee had gone to accommodation the team had in Weymouth and stayed there until he felt it was safe to drive. 'The South Korean Olympic committee will take a very serious view of this and he will probably be disqualified as the national coach.' Through an interpreter, Lee, who gave his address as the Olympic Village on Portland, pleaded guilty to a charge of driving with excess alcohol.

One mum, Lindsey Ambler, 36, of Orton Brimbles, near Peterborough, said all four of her children – Chloe, 13, Megan, 11, Charlotte, 9, and Luca aged seven - plus her three nieces have been sick after visiting the water park this week. When they visited the park on Monday she noticed the water was ""cloudy"" and days later her children were all vomiting, running to the toilet and clutching their tummies. ‘ I scooped up some water in a bucket and noticed that it looked cloudy. ‘We didn't think anything would be seriously wrong at the time but days later my youngest boy Luca was sick. ‘He has had a fever, diarrhoea and upset stomach and hasn't been able to sleep because he's worried about being ill again.’ Peterborough Town Hall: The city council owns the water park . Mrs Ambler added ‘My children are fit and healthy they are hardly ever off school, so being ill is a shock to their systems. ‘That says to me, as a parent, that whatever caused this is a pretty strong bug. ‘My kids have been totally hit for six and I just have to hope that they will recover quickly.’ Investigations into what caused to outbreak of illnesses are continuing, although it may be over a week until the results are known. Another concerned parent, Georgina Farrow, of Werrington, said all three of her children have been sick. ‘They all visited the water park and were fine afterwards but have all had upset stomachs since. ‘As a parent I'm obviously keen to know what caused this and just how serious it is.’ Some parents reported their children have suffered rashes as well as the other symptoms. Mother-of-two Tami Harris took her ten-year-old son Henry and nine-year-old daughter Georgina to the water park on Tuesday. ‘We had a lovely time. The park was absolutely heaving, because of the weather. ‘But since then my two children have been really ill, and I have heard of another 30 others who have been ill as well. ‘My son got a rash on his back and tummy, and then was sick through the night. ‘We went to the doctors, and they said they have never seen anything like the rash before. ‘Henry is still struggling to eat a couple of days later. He said that the water at the park was really cloudy and dirty, and if I had known that at the time I would have told them to get out.’ A spokeswoman for Peterborough City Council, said: ‘It is too early to say exactly what could have caused this bout of sickness. ‘Our environmental health officers are working closely with our colleagues at Enterprise Peterborough to investigate. ‘As soon as we received information we acted swiftly to close the park so that tests can be carried out on the water. ‘We have checked maintenance and cleaning records for the facility and can confirm that they are all up to date. ‘It is our priority to understand what has caused this problem and we will endeavour to re-open the park as soon as this has been addressed. ‘Given the hot weather we are keen to have the park open for the public to enjoy at the earliest possible date, however we must emphasise that public health and safety is our main priority.’","Bretton Water Park in Peterborough has been closed .

It is entirely understandable that when you train so hard for an elusive Olympic gold but fail at one of the final hurdles, you would be upset - perhaps even inconsolable as the life-long dream turns to dust. But this South Korean athlete may have taken her emotions a little too far after bowing out of the semi-finals of the women's fencing following one of the most controversial moments of the Games so far. Fencer Shin Lam was in floods of tears at the ExCeL arena after the biggest controversy of the Olympics so far. Controversy: Shin Lam of South Korea reacts after losing to Britta Heidemann of Germany . The 25-year-old thought she was . through to the final of the women’s epee when, to her horror and that of . her coach Shim Jaesung, the clock was reset from zero to one second. And . when the action resumed German Britta Heidemann, gold medallist four . years ago, scored a do-or-die hit that appeared to have given her a . place in the final against Ukraine’s Yana Shemyakana. The Korean coach was incandescent. He furiously launched an appeal against the decision that had allowed the fight to continue and it was nearly half an hour before it was announced to the crowd - slow-handicapping by this stage - that Heidemann’s win stood. Shin broke down in tears for the second time and while her opponent celebrated she remained on the piste, in what appeared to be a sit-down protest. Contrasting fortunes: Lam was in floods of tears as Britta Heidemann (right) celebrates her win . The crowd was then told she was doing that because a formal appeal was being considered and if she left the field of play it would be deemed an acceptance of defeat. By then the bronze medal match should have started, but that faced a lengthy delay - as did the final to follow. Dream over: Officials lead the fencer away after her appeal . Shin only needed to draw the contest in sudden death because she had been given priority - that is, the onus was on Heidemann to score in the extra minute of sudden death. The crowd could hardly believe their ears just before 7.40pm - nearly an hour after the incident - when they were told part of the rules was that the Koreans had to lodge money for the appeal to be valid. Still Shin remained on the piste, . bringing back memories of compatriot Byun Jong-il’s sit-down strike . during the boxing in Seoul in 1988.The big difference was that Shin was an innocent in all this and just doing what she was told. Just before 8pm an official came onto the piste to encourage Shin to leave, but she was unwilling to move. Alone: Lam refused to leave after the controversial decision was announced . All out for the win: Heidemann (right) scores the final point to secure a controversial victory . Another official came on to assist as she crumbles and burst into tears again. The crowd jeered the losing Olympian as she was escorted from the piste, even though the decision had not been announced. As she was hugged by her coach the announcer asked for respect to be shown to the athletes and judges - and also a big round of applause for the world No 12 as she finally left. Out of luck: Shin lost the bronze medal match against China's Sun Yujie . The coach left as well, still clearly furious about an outcome that the fans had yet to be told about. The final should have been staged by then, but the crowd was not able to see what happened next. The spectators had no idea what was going on back stage. The final decision was that Shin had lost the semi-final and was to compete in the bronze medal match. Amazingly it began a few minutes later, the Korean coach saying: 'We will try to clam her down, even though she is to be extremely stressed'. A cult hero of sorts, Shin somehow summoned up the concentration to take an early 4-2 lead over world No 1 Sun Yujie - every hit being roared by her new-found fans. With the last three-minute period to go it was 9-9, but Shin's agony became complete when Sun took the bronze 15-11 and she was left empty-handed from a night she and the audience will never forget. This morning BBC fencing commentators complained live on air about technical difficulties. Not only did they complain they they were too far from the competitors to see the actual fencing, but their monitors were not working. It has been reported that they were having to stream the contest live in order to provide the service. Not the only one: Gemma Howell was also distraught after she lost her  judo bout through disqualification . Of course Shin won't be the last to show an overt display of emotion when the Olympic dream comes crashing down. Great Britain's judo competitor Gemma Howell was today disqualified from the women's under-63kg judo round of 32. Gevrise Emane, of France, proved to be a tough opponent for Team GB's Howell, but she was more than holding her own. During the latter stages of the bout Howell was adjudged to have illegally grabbed the Frenchwoman's leg which incurred an automatic disqualification. The Team GB martial artist broke down afterwards, as she saw her Games gold slip through her fingers. You're out! Howell looks dumbstruck when she is told she has been disqualified .

Residents of a North Yorkshire village have been left furious after thousands of travellers descended on a stately home for a week-long evangelical gathering without warning. Up to 5,000 members of the Light and Life church have arrived for a convention at the 17th century Carlton Towers, home to Lord and Lady Gerald Fitzalan Howard, since the weekend, outnumbering the 1,800-strong population of Carlton, near Selby. The annual gathering has taken place every year in various locations around the country since 1952. Thousands of gypsies have arrived for a week-long evangelical festival, with North Yorkshire residents complaining of noise and intimidation . Thousands of churchgoers have arrived in cars, caravans and flatbed trucks to the festival at the 17th century ancestral home of the Duke of Norfolk . Residents say the group started arriving on Friday, with churchgoers from as far away as France and America making the journey to the tiny village. They have complained of noise and intimidation by the gypsies, but North Yorkshire police have only been called to one incident where a group of young people trespassed on the local cricket pitch. The force is holding daily security meetings with festival organisers because of the event's large scale, and has put on extra patrols for residents' peace of mind. Hundreds of caravans have been parked for the week at the Carlton Towers estate, which is the ancestral home of the Duke of Norfolk and once featured in an episode of The Darling Buds of May. A local pub landlord complained that he was subjected to verbal abuse and had to work extra hours to cope with the deluge. James Smith of the Forresters Arms said: 'I was abused with the sort of language I have never heard in my life, especially from the young girls. 'I have never seen anything here on this scale before and the village did not know anything about it. 'On Sunday I worked six or seven hours just to sit on the door. 'I had to shut the toilets three or four times, they were a total mess. Carlton Towers, pictured, is in the heart of the picturesque village of Carlton, near Selby, North Yorkshire. Sessions at the Light and Life church evangelical festival include preaching and prayers to 'save' travellers . Mr Smith called for the venue to foot the bill for the running of the event. He said: 'This is affecting everybody's lives and the police have told us it will take four days to empty the site, there are that many cars. 'I'm going to see the police inspector in charge next week to make sure the bill for the event is paid by Carlton Towers and not the taxpayer. We did not know anything about this, we should not have to pay for it.' Local county councillor Margaret Hulme said her house had been disturbed by young people ringing on her electronic gates repeatedly on Sunday night, and other villages in the area were also affected. She said: 'They are not causing any criminal damage but they are intimidating people. 'They are also going into the neighbouring village of Snaith and the clerk of the parish council there said she had to close the offices because so many people were coming in and trying to use the toilets. 'Residents here are absolutely furious.' The main festival tent is adorned with a 'God is Love' banner and can seat 1,800 people for preaching and prayer events. Joe Boswell, a pastor of the Light and Life Church and one of the main ministers at the event, said the historic Yorkshire venue was discovered as a site to host this year's festival partly through prayer. He said: 'We are here to preach the gospel to reach the lost. 'We are evangelical and born in the spirit of God. 'We have had a lot more people than we thought, it is a good problem and a bad one as well. The roads are clear and we are working with police. 'We will be gone on Friday, I will be one of the last ones to leave the field and we will leave it the way we found it. 'There are skips, toilets, and staff here patrolling the road. 'If anyone has any fears that we are staying then that is not what we are here for. 'We are very pleased that the landowners have received us.' Mr Boswell added: 'There are a lot of groups that are coming from the local area that are not staying on this field and we are responsible for anything that happens in the field area. 'But if we are aware of any problems then we can come and help.' A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'The force is aware of a gathering of the Gypsy Light and Life Church at Carlton Towers in Selby District. 'It is an organised private event which has attracted a large number of people. 'The organisers liaised with the force prior to the event which has been held previously in other areas of the country without incident. Officers are present at the site, as they would be for any event of this size, and have not encountered any problems. 'Reassurance patrols will continue until the conclusion of the gathering on Friday.'","5,000 members of the Light and Life church arrive in North Yorkshire, outnumbering 1,800 residents of Carlton, near Selby .

A 101-year-old Rolls-Royce dubbed the ‘Best Car in the World’ is expected to fetch £550,000 at auction. The stunning Rolls-Royce was the height of luxury when it rolled off the production line in 1911 - costing up to ten times more than the average professional's annual wage at around £1500 each. The same amount would have been enough to buy a large house in the country at the time. The car was officially named the 40/50hp but it soon picked up the 'Silver Ghost' moniker from owners and journalists because of its supreme quality. The best car in the world: A 1911 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost is set to sell for £550,000 at auction . Luxurious: The Silver Ghost, which once belonged to Sir Adolph Tuck - the son of Raphael Tuck who made his fortune in the postcard business, has a red leather interior . The classic car, which was first launched in 1906, was even named the 'Best car in the world' by the prestigious publication Autocar in 1907. This particular model was made in 1911 and delivered on April 1 that year to Sir Adolph Tuck, the son of Raphael Tuck who made his fortune in the postcard industry at the end of the 19th century. Sir Adoph had the Rolls-Royce, which comes with its own champagne holder and picnic basket, fitted with a Landaulette body so he could be chauffeur driven around. It was later re-bodied as a period two-seat tourer by Rippon Brothers Ltd, a coach building company with a proud history dating back centuries, which made a chariot throne for Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. With Ghosts very rarely coming onto the open market, this classic example of luxury British engineering is expected to attract global interest when it is sold at Brooklands on September 1. Auction house Historics, which is managing the sale, has set a guide price of £450,000 to £550,000 for when it goes under the hammer. Fully equipped: The Rolls-Royce comes complete with a picnic basket containing champagne and silver goblets . Classic build: The Silver Ghost boasts a 7.4-litre engine and is known for its quality . Edward Bridger-Stille, Historics auction director, said: 'To find a Silver Ghost for sale is a red letter day. 'The Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost is a treasured car, it was so advanced and expensive when it was launched. It could cost the same a country home. 'As an auctioneer there are cars you like to be offered to sell and this is certainly one of them. 'The opportunity to acquire a Silver Ghost as beautiful as this is extremely rare and I anticipate that this significant, museum quality example, should generate interest from all corners of the world.' The Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost was launched in 1906 with Henry Royce building it to showcase the highest level of engineering skill alongside an unrivalled passion for quality. It was an overwhelming success with Autocar calling it the Best Car in the World the following year. Pricey: The Rolls-Royce would have cost around £1500 in 1911 - the equivalent of up to ten times the average professional's wage at the time . This model, which goes by the name ‘Chassis 1557’, was fitted with a 7.4-litre engine which produced between 40bhp and 50bhp. To demonstrate the car’s quality, a Silver Ghost was driven from London to Edinburgh and back in top gear the whole way, managing an incredible 24mpg. In 1977, Chassis 1557 attended the Queen’s Jubilee parade through Windsor Castle to the Silver Ring at Ascot Racecourse. It underwent as full restoration in 2001, and has picked up a number of prizes at concours events organised by the Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts’ Club. Phillip Brooks, a Rolls-Royce historian, said: 'Silver Ghosts are the cars that made the factory’s reputation, and they were wonderful cars in their day and are still wonderful cars now. 'Chassis 1557 would be great fun to drive from John O’Groats to Lands End, or just as easily from New York to San Francisco.'","Named the 'best car in the world' by Autocar a year after being launched .

Thirty two sleeping passengers were killed last night as a fire tore through an express train carriage in India. The horrific blaze broke out on a long distance service from New Delhi as passengers slept in the early hours near the town of Nellore, in Andhra, Pradesh. The most likely cause is believed to be an electrical short circuit as investigators got under way. Killed while asleep: 32 passengers on the express train from New Delhi died when a fire broke out on this carriage . Madhusudan Sarma, a senior administrative officer in Nellore district said: ‘Thirty-two (bodies) have been pulled out from the coach.’ Another 26 people were injured, two critically. One carriage was completely gutted as rescuers struggled with intense temperatures inside the mostly metal structure of the train. Cutting torches were used to open wider access points for the emergency services. Burned to death: While some passengers were able to jump out the windows, others were not so lucky with medical staff carrying many bodies away from the accident scene in body bags . Fatal fire: The blaze completely destroyed this carriage and is believed to have been caused by an electrical short circuit . Survivors and crowds of onlookers watched in horror as the blackened bodies of victims were lifted out of the destroyed carriage and laid in rows along the railway line. Family members of the victims wailed and screamed while other dazed survivors sat around quietly with their belongings. Passenger Shantanu, who gave only one name, told the NDTV news channel: ‘I woke up when people were rushing into our compartment, I was in S-10 which was attached to the S-11 coach that caught fire. ‘There was smoke all around. We tried to open the emergency window, people jumped out of it.’ Nellore chief district official B. Sreedhar said preliminary investigations suggested a short circuit near a toilet had triggered the blaze. High heat: Rescuers and firefighters struggled with extreme temperatures in the mostly metal carriage . No escape: For many passengers there was no way to escape the blaze in rooms with little ventilation and bars over the windows . Railway Minister Mukul Roy said an investigation was underway as rescue officials finished their nearly 12 hour search for bodies. He said: ‘Nothing can be excluded and nothing can be said without an investigation. The train was travelling at 70 mph when it passed through Nellore station, where staff noticed the fire and informed the railway authorities. Long distance disaster: The express train left from New Delhi on its way to Chennai until the blaze broke out in the carriage near the town of Nellore last night . It was less than 120 miles from the train’s final destination, Chennai, the capital city of Indian state Tamil Nadu. India's accident-prone rail network . is still the main form of long distance travel in the country, despite . fierce competition from private airlines. While . new shiny airport infrastructure is springing up across the country, . the Indian railways, a legacy of British colonial rule, often appear . stuck in a time warp. Shock: These women were among the crowd that gathered as rescuers searched for bodies for almost 12 hours . Look on in horror: Survivors and crowds of onlookers watched as rescuers searched the train for bodies and investigators looked for the cause . There were two fatal accidents in May alone, including a collision that killed 25 people near the southern city of Bangalore. Four passengers also died after a train derailed in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sent his condolences over the deaths and has asked the national railways ministry to coordinate the relief effort, his office said. In March, the then railway minister . Dinesh Trivedi unveiled a draft budget for 2012-13 that included a major . safety upgrade to be financed by across-the-board fare hikes. Accident-prone rail: While rail is still India's main form of long distance travel, there was more than 25,000 fatalities on the railways in 2009 . But he was forced to withdraw it and resign after a rebellion from his own populist party, the Trinamool Congress, which objected to increasing ticket prices for the poorest travellers. India's worst rail accident was in 1981 when a train plunged into a river in the eastern state of Bihar, killing an estimated 800 people. The National Crime Records Bureau, which gathers the causes of fatalities across India, says 25,705 people in total died on the railways in 2009. The data is not broken down, but a vast majority of these deaths are people falling from the open doors of carriages or being hit on the tracks, which are mostly unsecured. Surviving passengers: Relatives of the victims were seen screaming and wailing while survivors waited with their belongings, many shocked and dazed by what had happened while they slept . Waiting for the train that never came: Passengers wait at Chennai Central Station next to a list of those injured in the train fire .","The fire gutted a carriage on the express train from New Delhi .

A dog owner allowed one of his Jack Russell's to starve to death with another forced to eat its remains after leaving the pair without food for a month. Shane Maurice Potts, 29, left the animals unattended after moving with his children to stay at his mother’s home. The dogs were left in appalling conditions and although there was a bag of dog biscuits on a worktop - it was just out of their reach. Grim: A dog owner allowed one of his Jack Russell's to starve to death. Simba, pictured, only stayed alive after eating the remains of the dead dog. Simba is pictured after being rescued . A female called ‘Nala’, eventually starved to death while the other, a male called ‘Simba’, stayed alive by eating her remains, . Appearing at Buxton Magistrates Court yesterday, Potts, from High Peak, Derbyshire, admitted two animal cruelty charges. The dogs were discovered by RSPCA inspector Lorna Campbell after a call from a concerned member of the public. She said: 'When I saw Simba at the window it was obvious he was emaciated and when I looked in I saw what I thought was a toy he’d chewed up. 'It took a moment before I realised the full horror of what it actually was, the remains of Nala. It was devastating.' The RSPCA had offered advice to Potts in July 2011, given him neutering vouchers and re-homed a third dog which he had at that time but had no complaints since. Horrific: Shane Maurice Potts, 29, left the animals unattended after moving with his children to stay at his mother's home. The scene inside the flat is pictured . The court heard that Potts and his children had moved into his mother’s house in Chapel-en-le-Frith. He hadn’t been back to his own property for more than four weeks. RSPCA Inspector Campbell said: 'That Simba survived is a miracle. When police gained access he raced past us to a bowl of dirty water in the garden with cigarette butts in it and tried to drink from it. 'The conditions in the house were terrible. The place was covered in faeces and the floor was slippery with urine. 'There was a shredded dog food bag on the floor, an empty tub of gravy granules and chewed towels and of course what was left of his companion. 'Tragically, there was a bag of dog biscuits on the worktop which it looked as though the dogs had been trying to reach but it was just too high.' Potts’ solicitor told the court he was finding it difficult to manage his responsibilities and had moved in with his mother to help. He’s due to appear at Buxton Magistrates Court on August 21 for sentencing. After being signed over to the RSPCA, Simba has recovered and has been happily re-homed.","Shane Maurice Potts left the animals unattended after moving with his children to stay at his mother’s home .

Kiara Mayne Estright, 19, has been convicted of aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a child, as well as simple assault and reckless endangerment. The mother, who lives in Reading, Pennsylvania, was charged last year with the crimes, after she repeatedly showed up at emergency rooms in Reading and Philadelphia to get her son treatment for numerous broken bones. Guilty: Kiara Mayne Estright has been found guilty of abusing her toddler-aged son . The Reading Eagle reported that Estright’s trial lasted three days, and the jury deliberated for hours before returning with their guilty verdict. In total, her son suffered a broken leg, another broken leg after his cast was removed, as well as a broken arm, broken hand, broken collar bone, and a skull fracture. He also had broken ribs. Estright told the court that the injuries came about because her son is highly active. ‘He was always running around,’ she said. ‘I let him be a boy.’ Assistant District Attorney Ellen R. West said that since her son has been placed in foster care, he has not sustained any injuries. She further noted that the entirety of the boy’s many breaks happened when he was between 15 and 22 months, and only when he was in his mother’s care. The Eagle previously reported that authorities were alerted last October after Estright brought her son to the hospital with a broken arm. After authorities were alerted, the hospital staff performed a full body scan on the toddler, revealing several breaks and fractures in various states of healing. At the time, Estright defended herself by saying her toddler broke his ribs after she accidentally grabbed him too hard, and said he fractured his skull by hitting the headboard too hard.","Mother Kiara Mayne Estright, 19, convicted of abusing her toddler .

A prominent plastic surgeon based out of Los Angeles has been arrested after allegedly filming patients without their consent after they had undressed. Dr Lance Everett Wyatt was arrested Thursday and charged with unlawful filming of another and unlawful viewing of another, among other crimes. The surgeon, who specialises in plastic and reconstructive surgery, has appeared on ABC News’ 20/20 as well as TV show The Doctors. Scroll down for video . Peeping tom? Dr Lance Everett Wyatt was arrested yesterday for allegedly videotaping two of his patients surreptitiously while they were naked . Digs: He works out of the East Medical Tower, which is adjacent to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center . Wyatt was arrested yesterday morning after Beverly Hills police felt they had sufficient evidence against him. He faces six counts, including unlawful filming of another and unlawful viewing of another, as well as two counts of sexual battery on another patient. Police were tipped off after one female patient filed a complaint that Wyatt was recording her naked while she was on a follow-up visit. She later brought in a camera she discovered in his office, authorities said. Each count against Wyatt is a misdemeanour. The surgeon’s bail was set at $50,000, which he immediately posted. If he is convicted on all of the charges against him, Wyatt could spend up to two years in prison. Earlier this week, a New York urologist at a prestigious Manhattan hospital was arrested after he was allegedly caught using a pen camera to take pictures up women’s skirts in a crowded subway car. Adam Levinson, 39, was arrested Tuesday after a witness reported the Mt Siani doctor holding a newspaper with the pen camera in its folds, allegedly pointing it up women’s skirts. Noted: Dr Wyatt was once featured on ABC News' 20/20 and also was interviewed for TV show The Doctors . Medical Board of California spokeswoman Jennifer Simoes told the Associated Press that the alleged crimes were discovered after the board received a complaint that Wyatt had videotaped a naked patient during an examination without her consent or knowledge. City Attorney Carmen Trutanich told the Los Angeles Times that Wyatt breaked the ‘sacred trust’ between doctors and patients ‘and he should be held accountable.’ According to prosecutors, Wyatt allegedly recorded two undressed patients who were visiting him for post-operative evaluations. Two time's a trend: Dr Adam Levinson, a New York City urologist, was arrested earlier this week for allegedly pointing a camera pen up a woman's skirt . As NBC Los Angeles’ Medical Editor Dr Bruce Hensel noted that it falls in many doctor’s job descriptions to photograph patients for medical purposes. He said: ‘There are reasons for plastoic surgeons to take photos, before or after, or for computer images to show you how you’ll look, but in those cases, you need to give consent…or it’s not legal.’ Following a joint investigation with law enforcement, an additional victim was discovered. Authorities are concerned there may still be more victims. According to Wyatt’s website, he graduated from UCLA and worked as a fellow for Harvard Medical School, and was named by EBONY magazine as one of the ’50 leaders of tomorrow.’ View more videos at: http://nbclosangeles.com.","Lance Everett Wyatt M.D. arrested Thursday in Los Angeles after allegations made he filmed patients naked without their consent .

Well-off: Anthony Jarrard, 50, had £160,000 in the bank and earned money from fixing and teaching guitar and playing in a popular local band . A benefits cheat who played guitar in a band called Shady Deal has been ordered to pay back more than £157,000. Anthony Jarrard, 50, dishonestly pocketed council tax benefit, jobseeker's allowance, income support and incapacity benefit, while neglecting to declare that he owned a house in Braintree, Essex. The talented musician claimed to be unemployed but earned money from playing in his band, and teaching and fixing the guitar, Ipswich Crown Court heard. He also had tens of thousands . of pounds in savings. The unscrupulous criminal was only caught out when he was arrested for . shoplifting at Halfords in Lowestoft, Suffolk, in 2009 and was found to have a . Halifax bank card in another name. He initially claimed he had found it in the town centre but later admitted the card belonged to him and told officers he had opened the account in a fake name to avoid paying Poll Tax. Suffolk Police's Financial Investigation . Unit began looking into his circumstances and discovered he had been . claiming benefits since 1995. Jarrard had owned his home in . Braintree since 1998 and when he began claiming council tax benefit in . 2003 he had £69,000 savings in his bank account, the judge heard. Jarrard admitted three offences of failing to notify a change in circumstances while claiming benefit. Lies: Jarrard fraudulently claimed council tax benefit, jobseeker's allowance, income support and incapacity benefit, Ipswich Crown Court heard . He also admitted one charge of making a false representation to obtain benefit and was jailed last November for 12 months. Between 2003 and 2010 a . massive £70,000 was paid into Jarrard's account and by March last . year the balance had soared to £158,000. The ceiling for savings to claim benefit was £16,000. 'Addicted to money': Jarrard was jailed last November for claiming £34,000 in benefits while failing to declare that he owned a house in Braintree, Essex and had thousands of pounds of savings . After hearing the offender's available assets were £163,960, Judge Rupert Overbury made a confiscation order yesterday for £157,495. The court decided he had only managed to save up his money because of his 'criminal lifestyle'. Jarrard fiddled more than £34,000 over a period of seven years, the court heard, and will have to  pay £30,338 to the Department of Work and Pensions and £4,507 to Braintree District Council. He claimed incapacity benefit in 2004 after he had an accident. Jarrard insisted he was suffering anxiety and could not raise his shoulder. Judge John Devaux told Jarrard as he jailed him: 'You weren't driven by gambling or a drug addiction. 'It could be said your addiction was money itself.' At Jarrard's sentencing hearing last . November, his barrister Christopher Paxton said the popular local group . played in pubs and clubs around Braintree. But Mr Paxton wryly told the court: 'They weren't the Rolling Stones.' He said Jarrard had lived a frugal and reclusive lifestyle and his claim for benefits had not been fraudulent from the outset. Suffolk Police Financial investigator Rachel Jarvis said: 'The Financial Investigation Unit in Suffolk strives to ensure that those who commit crime and benefit financially will be forced to pay back the profits they have made from their activities. 'This case in particular demonstrates that by applying the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation, we can ensure that criminals do not prosper from acting dishonestly and will be brought to justice.'","Had thousands in savings and owned house .

Team GB can still win bronze, however, and will meet New Zealand in a play-off for third place on Friday. Britain's players would have been hoping that Kate's appearance was a lucky omen as she had witnessed one of the country's greatest Olympic moments the night before. She sat in the velodrome with Prince William and Prince Harry when Sir Chris Hoy won his sixth gold medal to become Britain's most successful Olympian of all time. Team GB's women left themselves too much to do after first-half goals from Noel Barrionuevo and Carla Rebecchi gave Argentina an early lead. Although Alex Danson's late close-range strike set up a grandstand finish it proved to be little consolation. Great Britain were the better side in the second half as they strived to level the match.

Kennedy Jr. told police that on the day before his wife hanged herself, she told him 'everything was her fault.' Papers released Wednesday by the Bedford Police Department in New York include a statement Mr Kennedy gave a detective after Mary Kennedy's body was discovered after she killed herself on May 16. Kennedy said that his wife called him on May 15. ‘She told me she was sorry for everything. She said I was right about everything, and everything was her fault. She then told me she needed me to take care of her,’ he reportedly told Bedford police. How they used to be: Robert Kennedy Jr. and his estranged wife Mary were in the midst of an ongoing divorce battle at the time of her suicide in May . Much of the statement was blacked out so that it could not be read publicly before it was released. The visible portion does not make clear what Mary Kennedy meant by 'everything.' A day after RFK Jr. rebuffed Mary’s desperate plea for his help, she was found hanged in their barn. Depression: The day before her death, Mary called Bobby asking for help and he reportedly refused . The New York Daily News reports that the caretaker on the property told police that RFK said to her that he could not do anything to help Mary because ‘she doesn’t want to help herself.’ The Kennedys, who had four children, were in the midst of a divorce when she died. In the court documents, Kennedy also describes his first sight of his wife's body, but the specifics were blacked out. The police documents include transcriptions of their conversations with the unidentified caretaker, who said that in the days and weeks leading up to the suicide, she became increasingly concerned about Mary’s well-being and went so far as to call Bobby, one of the direct members of the famed Kennedy clan, who had been spending the majority of his time on the West Coast. ‘I noticed some changes in Mary. I thought something was wrong with her. I told Bobby about her, and I told him that she needs help,’ the caretaker reportedly told police, . Among those changes were a resigned attitude and schedule changes- instead of waking up and going to the gym, Mary began spending mornings ‘staying in bed by herself’. At one point, Mary ‘asked me to pray for her, because she got more bad news from her lawyer’. After her death, family members and friends publicly acknowledged that Mary had a long history of depression and alcohol issues, revealing her participation in Alcoholics Anonymous. In spite of his initial rejection of her plea for help, Bobby told police that he called Mary's AA sponsor, named Shannon White. Ms White was also interviewed by police and her story matches that of Bobby's. The compound: The caretaker of the family's Bedford home first sounded the alarm by calling RFK Jr after she searched the house and could not find Mary anywhere on the day she was later found dead . Timeline: Bobby then called Mary's AA sponsor and said that he was going to try to find her but also asked for the sponsor's help. The sponsor was the one to find Mary's body hanging in the barn that afternoon . Family moment: RFK Jr holds his childrens' hands when they laid Mary's body to rest . Bobby called Ms White on the morning of . May 16 describing the couple's conversation the night before and asking . Ms White to check on Mary because 'he was worried that something had . happened to Mary and that she may have hurt herself'. Ms White said that she too received an unusual call from Mary the night before, saying that she was upset after her phone call with Bobby. She added that the call was particularly surprising because she had noted how well Mary had been doing in AA in recent months. The Journal News reports that records show that there was confusion and fear among those closest to Mary on the morning of May 16. Police released the fact that there was a phone call placed from the Bedford estate to Bobby's residence at 7.51am that morning. It appears to have gone unanswered. Summer romance: Conor Kennedy, Mary and Bobby's eldest son, was recently spotted on a romantic trip to the family Hyannis estate with country star Taylor Swift . The caretaker called Bobby that morning, saying that she had searched the house and could not find Mary, prompting her to worry. Bobby then called Ms White, saying that he too was concerned. 'Robert said he was going to look for Mary and I said I would look as well,' Ms White told police. In charge: Conor Kennedy, Mary's son who just recently turned 18, is petitioning the courts to be named the administrator of her estate . Initial reports conflict over whether it was Ms White or the caretaker who first found the body, but The Journal News reports that it was Ms White who found Mary's body hanging in the barn on the compound that afternoon. An autopsy report showed she had antidepressants in her system when she died. The police reports cite an unidentified family friend who says that Bobby called them asking for advice on how to tell his children that Mary had killed herself. 'I suggested telling them himself and gathering people around him who are supportive. I also suggested he clear his calendar to be with them. He said maybe he should take them away somewhere … I said they may need to be close by their mother’s things for a bit,' the person said in the report. They added that Bobby also asked police separately for advice on how to tell the four children, who ranged in age from 11 years old to 17 years old at the time. None of the children were at the home on the day of the death. A judge says he'll likely approve a request from the couple's 18-year-old son Conor, who has recently been photographed romancing country star Taylor Swift, to be named administrator of his mother's estate. Conor Kennedy's lawyer said in Surrogate's Court in White Plains, N.Y. that his client just recently turned 18, qualifying him to administer the estate of Mary Kennedy. A lawyer for Robert Kennedy raised no objection. The judge said he expects to grant Conor Kennedy's application.","Police papers reveal the flurry of dramatic phone calls on the day before Mary Kennedy's suicide .

The JetBlue Airways pilot who disrupted a cross-country flight by leaving the cockpit to ramble about religion and terrorists has had a psychotic episode in prison and requires further mental evaluation, a judge said on Wednesday. Captain Clayton Osbon was charged with interference with a flight crew but was found not guilty by reason of insanity last month. A forensic neuro-psychologist testified in a short, unpublicized trial that Osbon had a 'brief psychotic disorder' at the time of the flight brought on by lack of sleep. Veteran: Clayton Osbon was a respected airline . captain before he went 'berserk' and began running through the cabin of . his own plane. He had to be restrained by a passenger and was taken to a . mental hospital . Emergency landing: The co-pilot was forced to set the . JetBlue plane doesn in Amarillo, Texas, after the Mr Osbon left the . cockpit . Passengers said Osbon left the cockpit . during a March 27 flight from New York to Las Vegas. He ran through the . plane's cabin yelling about Jesus and al-Qaida. The flight was diverted . and safely landed in Amarillo, Texas. After the trial, Osbon was sent to a prison medical facility in North Carolina for evaluation. He was scheduled to return to Amarillo federal court this week for another hearing on whether he should go free or be sent to a mental health facility. Instead, U.S. District Judge Mary Lou Robinson on Wednesday extended Osbon's evaluation period to October 15, with a final evaluation report due to her by the end of that month. Robinson said she was notified by a forensic psychologist that Osbon 'had suffered a psychotic episode'. She did not say what the nature of the episode was, if it was connected to his previous disorder or what prompted it. A message seeking comment was left for Osbon's attorney, Dean Roper. Robinson's order said attorneys on both sides did not oppose the extension. Neuropsychologist Robert E.H. Johnson testified in July that Osbon's psychotic disorder lasted about a week after the flight, according to a hearing transcript. He didn't say how long Osbon had gone without sleeping before boarding the plane, and his psychiatric evaluation of Osbon has been sealed, but he determined Osbon suffered from brief psychotic disorder and delusions 'secondary to sleep deprivation'. Those symptoms made Osbon incapable of understanding why his actions on the flight were wrong, Johnson testified. Fit for trial? JetBlue captain Clayton Frederick Osbon, . pictured being escorted by FBI agents, was found innocent by reason of insanity after being . indicted on one count of interference of a crew on a flight from New York to Las . Vegas . Lost control: Osbon, 49, screamed 'say your . prayers, say your prayers' at horrified passengers after running up and . down the aisle shouting 'Iraq, al-Qaeda, terrorism, we're all going . down' Osbon showed up unusually late for . the March 27 flight. The plane was in midair when he told his first . officer that they wouldn't make it to their destination, according to . court documents. Osbon started rambling about . religion. He scolded air traffic controllers to quiet down, then turned . off the radios altogether and dimmed the monitors in the cockpit. He . said aloud that 'things just don't matter' and encouraged his co-pilot . they take a leap of faith. The first officer then 'became really . worried', according to a sworn affidavit from FBI agent John Whitworth. 'Osbon started trying to correlate completely unrelated numbers like . different radio frequencies, and he talked about sins in Las Vegas.' A flight attendant's ribs were bruised as passengers tried to restrain Osbon but no one on board was seriously injured.

Alex Reid has gone to extreme lengths to win back the heart of his estranged fiancée Chantelle Houghton. With the cagefighter issuing a public video plea for his ex-fiancée to take him back, the blonde reality star was spotted looking emotional outside their former family home in Essex. Since they split less than two weeks ago, they have been involved in a bitter war of words through separate interviews and columns in magazines. Reid, who revealed on Twitter he has dropped his shared publicist with Chantelle, decided to forget the traditional chocolate and flowers approach to forgiveness, instead opting for a more public apology. Scroll Down for Video . Tearful: Chantelle briefly breaks down just hours after Alex Reid released a public emotional message . And instead of resolving their differences in private, the cage-fighter has recorded a video, asking for her to take him back. The video, which was released on Now .

Public Plea: Alex Reid is hoping for another chance with Chantelle after his emotional message . He said: 'Chantelle, I love you, I really love Dolly and I really want us to work. But things really have to change. There's been so many untruths said, . and I feel if I don't say something, it's going to get worse and worse. Things have to change.' Despite filming the speech for everyone to hear, he added: 'You can't keep venting your anger to me in your column.

Essex home on Wednesday morning hours after Reid's comments, and she . seemed to be crying as she bowed her head down while clasping her hand . over her mouth. Perhaps she was moved by his very public plea for another chance. The former Celebrity Big Brother star, who gave birth to daughter Dolly three months ago, announced on Twitter earlier this month that she ended her relationship to Reid after she called the police on him when he allegedly kicked down the door to their Essex house in the early hours of the morning. Putting on a brave face: Chantelle has been trying to keep it together for the sake of their three-month-old daughter Dolly . Reid had previously spoken to Now Magazine about their problems, and attempted to explain the police incident. He said: 'I texted Chantelle two hours beforehand to tell her I was coming home. I rang the doorbell and knocked for five minutes. I called her, she . didn’t answer. So I sent her a text message saying, ""I will knock the . door down."" 'Out of sheer frustration I booted the door. It just came off.' According to Reid, Chantelle regretted calling the police, revealing: 'Chantelle was crying and telling them not to arrest me.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 13:59 EST, 9 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:16 EST, 9 August 2012 . A Florida prosecutor hoping to convict George Zimmerman of murder in the Trayvon Martin shooting made a humiliating blunder when her office released a photo of the teen's body. The documents were released today by the office of Special Prosecutor Angela Corey in the case of Zimmerman, who has been charged with second-degree murder in Martin’s February 26 death. But among the pages of evidence was a photo of Martin taken right after his death, as well as Zimmerman’s college records - which were supposed to be kept confidential. Scroll down for videos . Murder case: George Zimmerman, right, has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, left, in Sanford, Florida . Out of school: Documents revealed that Zimmerman withdrew from Seminole State College about a month after the shooting . The image, published by TheSmokingGun.com, showed the teen's body face-down in a grassy area where he had been shot in a scuffle with Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch captain. The files revealed that officers found Martin’s blood on a bag of Skittles in his pocket, and emails from the Sanford Police Department, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The records from Seminole State College revealed that Zimmerman had been placed on academic probation in 2011 for failing to keep his grade point average above 2.0. They also said that Zimmerman had been granted an administrative withdrawal about a month after the shooting. Meanwhile, Zimmerman will seek to have second-degree murder charges dismissed under Florida's 'stand your ground' law in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, his attorney said Thursday. Appeal: Last month, Zimmerman posted a nearly-2 minute, bilingual video thanking fans for their support . The hearing, which likely won't take place for several months, will amount to a mini-trial involving much of the evidence collected by prosecutors as well as expert testimony from both sides. Although the posting did not say so, legal experts say it's likely that Zimmerman himself would testify since he is the sole survivor of the February 26 confrontation. ""Most of the arguments, witnesses, experts and evidence that the defence would muster in a criminal trial will be presented in the 'stand your ground' hearing,' said the statement posted on Zimmerman's official defence website. Under the law, Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester can dismiss the charges if Zimmerman conclusively shows he fatally shot Martin because he 'reasonably believed' he might be killed or suffer 'great bodily harm' at the hands of the unarmed teenager. Legal battle: Zimmerman, pictured right at an April 20 bond hearing, will fight the charges against him using Florida's 'stand your ground' law . Killed: Trayvon Martin was shot and killed the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman . The law also says a person has no duty to retreat in the face of such a threat. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot Martin after a confrontation in Zimmerman's gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford, where Martin was visiting. The case drew local and nationwide protests because Zimmerman was not arrested for weeks after the shooting. Evidence released by prosecutors, the Zimmerman statement said, shows 'clear support for a strong claim of self-defense.' The statement added that Zimmerman attorney Mark O'Mara 'urges everyone to be patient during this process and to reserve judgment until the evidence is presented in the `stand your ground' hearing.' Defence: Zimmerman is represented by attorney Mark O'Mara, centre, seen walking to the Seminole County Court . Martin's parents have contended that Zimmerman singled out their son as he was returning from a convenience store because he was black and that it was Zimmerman's aggression that led to his death. Zimmerman, who is free on $1million bail, faces a possible life prison sentence if convicted of second-degree murder. If his 'stand your ground' claim succeeds, however, the criminal charges would be dismissed and Zimmerman could not be held liable in any civil action such as a wrongful death lawsuit. Prosecutors would likely appeal a successful self-defence claim. A spokeswoman for special prosecutor Angela Corey declined comment. An attorney for Martin's parents did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. Evidence: Zimmerman has said that Martin broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement, which corroborate with the Sanford police department's photos from that night . Legal experts have said that Zimmerman's credibility is a key to his claim and that he undermined his own cause by deceiving the judge about his finances during an April bond hearing. That alleged deception led to perjury charges against Zimmerman's wife, Shellie. She has pleaded not guilty. Lester, who will also decide the self-defence claim, said Zimmerman 'flaunted the system' by making misleading statements about how much money the couple had raised through online contributions from supporters. The judge revoked Zimmerman's initial $150,000 bond and had him returned to jail, then allowed him to be released on the higher $1million figure with additional restrictions.

As they trudged away from the disastrous Gallipoli campaign, the thoughts of Tommies fortunate enough to have survived inevitably turned to loved ones at home. But one of the First World War soldiers had something else on his mind. Among his belongings was a native tortoise that he had found comfort in caring for as artillery shells exploded around him and bullets whistled past. Veteran: Blake the tortoise was brought back to Britain by a soldier from the First World War nearly 100 years ago. He is now looking for a new home . So when it came to heading thousands of miles back to Britain on a troop ship in 1916, the pet came too. What became of the soldier, known only . as Mr Marris, remained unclear yesterday except that he died many years . ago. But Blake, as the spur-thighed tortoise is called, is still going . strong 96 years later. The story has only now come to light . after his current owner, Marion Skinner, felt she was no longer able to . care for him properly because he was getting a bit ‘geriatric’ and asked . an animal charity to help. Still fit: Dillon Prest (pictured with Blake), general manager at Swallow Equatics in East Harling, Norfolk, said the tortoise is still fit and lively despite his age . Long life: Blake has outlived his first owner by more than 30 years . Ancient: Tortoises often outlive their human owners - with some reaching up to 150 years of age . The retired office manager, 67, from . Neatishead, Norfolk, took possession of Blake in 1983 after advertising . for a female tortoise she could use for breeding. ‘A Mrs Marris . contacted us and said she had a female tortoise she was willing to let . us have,’ she said. ‘When we went to her house we saw it . was male but we decided to take it anyway. While we were there she told . us where the tortoise had come from.’ The sun-baked peninsula of Gallipoli . in Turkey takes its name from an ancient Greek word meaning ‘beautiful . city’. But it became hell on earth during the bloody campaign between . April 1915 and January 1916. Hell: The Gallipoli campaign against Turkey claimed the lives of thousands of Allied soldiers . Bloodbath: The campaign ended in disaster for the Allies after their troops came under heavy artillery fire from Ottoman forces . The Allies launched an attack . on Gallipoli in the Dardanelles in April 1915 during World War I, in a bid to capture the . Ottoman Empire's capital, Istanbul. Troops quickly became . bogged down on beaches under devastating Turkish . artillery fire. The assault was eventually called off in . January 1916 after almost 400,000 casualties on both sides. There were nearly half a million casualties during the campaign, according to the Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs, and many more soldiers became sick due to  unsanitary conditions, especially from enteric fever, dysentery and diarrhea. The British-French operation was . intended to capture Constantinople, now Istanbul, and open a sea route . to Russia. The Turks prevailed and 400,000 lives were lost on both . sides. Mrs Skinner, who has kept more than 20 . tortoises over the years, said the ideal place for Blake – so called . because he lived with the Marrises in Blakeney, near Norwich – would be . his native home in Turkey. There would be problems getting him through . customs, however, so a sunny British garden with plenty of weeds and . wildflowers to munch on would be the next best thing. A warm, dry shelter, such as a . greenhouse or utility area with UV lamp, would also be needed in cold . weather. Wherever he ends up, he does have one other need – he is still . mating despite his advancing years. ‘He’s truly astonishing,’ said Mrs . Skinner. Dillon Prest, who is temporarily . looking after Blake, said: ‘He is really quite fit and raring to go. The . only problem is that he has cataracts, which have proven difficult when . he meets a female tortoise he quite likes.’ Eleanor Tirtasana of the Tortoise Club . in Bracon Ash, near Norwich, which is trying to find him a permanent . home, said: ‘Many tortoises can live well into their hundreds, meaning . they often outlive their owners.’","Tortoise brought home to Norfolk in a soldier's kitbag from Turkey .

Serious: Martin Wheatley is reviewing Libor for the Government and has declared it is 'no longer fit for purpose' Libor could be scrapped completely in the wake of the rigging scandal that has swept through Britain's biggest banks. The Government has asked finance expert Martin Wheatley to head an official inquiry into how the key benchmark borrowing rate is set, and he said today it is 'no longer fit for purpose'. Mr Wheatley has published a paper aimed at trying to restore credibility and trust in a system that was so dramatically and secretly manipulated. Barclays was handed a £290 million fine for their role in the scandal, which eventually forced boss Bob Diamond to stand down. Meanwhile 17 of the world's biggest banks are accused of doing the same and look likely to be punished just as heavily. Mr Wheatley, who who heads conduct regulation for the Financial Services Authority, is openly considering axing Libor completely and replacing it with a rate based on trades that would make it harder to manipulate. And a new independent body could be set up to watch out for any suspicious activity, his report said. Mr Wheatley also wants more powers to prosecute rogue bankers. In a speech this morning, Mr Wheatley said: 'The attempted manipulation of Libor and its European equivalent Euribor have cast a shadow over the industry at large and the construction and governance of the benchmark themselves. Scroll down to hear from Martin Wheatley . Scandal: Rigging Libor cost Barclays its reputation and the job of its president Bob Diamond, pictured . 'It is clear that regardless of the outcome of ongoing international investigations, trust in a vital part of the financial system has been badly damaged and timely action is needed to restore it.' The Wheatley Review, which was ordered by Chancellor George Osborne said any move to using new rates would need to be carefully planned to limit disruption. Libor is an indicator of how much banks are charged to borrow money and can also be a benchmark of their financial health. It is used to set the price of hundreds of trillions of dollars of contracts across the world, including some mortgages and loans to businesses. However, the Libor scandal revealed that the system, currently overseen by the British Bankers' Association, has been abused by traders who lied about their bank's borrowing costs, in order to benefit their colleagues' trading positions or make the company seem more secure. The paper will now allow four weeks for banks and other parties to respond, and final recommendations are expected to be published by the end of next month. Chancellor George Osborne said: 'We've got to have a financial system we can all trust. 'This review shows the Government is acting swiftly and decisively to address the failings of Libor and put right what went wrong. 'We will now be able to make any changes to the law that are needed quickly, instead of waiting years. It shows we made the right decision last month.' The fast pace of the review is designed to allow its findings to be implemented in the Financial Services Bill, which is being discussed in the House of Lords. Peter Vicary-Smith, chief executive of Which?, said: 'Mr Wheatley has said it's vital to rebuild trust in the Libor setting process, but the bigger job is to rebuild trust in banking that has been shattered by one scandal after another. 'The Government and regulator must now thoroughly investigate the impact of Libor rate-rigging on ordinary borrowers and savers, and introduce a collective redress system to properly compensate consumers if they have lost out.'","Martin Wheatley, who is running the Government's inquiry, said today it is 'no longer fit for purpose'

Sarah-Jane Green, from North Yorkshire, had wanted to keep her dress after marrying fiancee David last month, but decided to sell it because she needed money to pay household bills. After she realised the African conman had used a fake PayPal account and she had wasted £100 on postage, Mrs Green emailed him to express her fury. The 33-year-old was amazed when she received an apology from the Nigerian for tricking her into giving away the handmade dress. He wrote: 'Am sorry, (I) am not a bad guy. I don’t know why am doing all this and I want to change, but it’s difficult to do... who is gonna feed me? 'I have a conscience for what am doing and I fear God. 'I know if I don’t stop I will end up in hell.' Mrs Green, from Catterick Garrison, had posted her dress on the Gumtree website and was then contacted by the conman who claimed he wanted to buy it.

Other efforts to deal with the fire . burning on grassland, timber and sagebrush have been hampered by the . weather conditions and the blaze has so far burned at least 28,000 acres or 44 square miles on the east slope of the Cascades mountain range. No injuries have been reported, but at least 900 people have been forced to leave their homes because of the blaze.Several hundred outbuildings have also been destroyed. It is believed the fire started on Monday at a bridge construction site located on Highway 10, between Ellensburg and Cle Elum. Incident commander Rex Reed said that by last night the blaze around Taylor Bridge was ten per cent contained, thanks to a containment line built around the southeast corner of the fire. But the blaze continues to spread and more than 400 firefighters from across the state were now trying to keep the flames away from heavy timber to the north. If the flames reach that abundant source of dry fuel, 'that adds a whole new equation,' said Reed. Joe Seemiller, a captain in Kittitas . County Fire and Rescue, said he and his crews monitored the edge of the fire . near the Yakima River yesterday. They have been trying to keep it from crossing to the other side and placing more homes under threat. 'Unless Mother Nature helps us out here, we're going to be fighting this awhile,' said Seemiller.

Lands Commissioner Peter Goldmark briefly traveled into the burned area where the fire started. In the distance, black smoke rose from a burning home in a subdivision across the river. He said the unusual amount of light fuels created by the cool, damp spring, coupled with high temperatures and windy conditions has created fires so destructive that they are impossible to hold or suppress.

They were preparing to float the Yakima River when they noticed the fire under the bridge from their deck. 'It sort of erupted, and the wind was blowing hard in our faces,' he said. 'It just shot up so fast.' The homes of at least three neighbors were gone, said Mr Rorem, 50, of North Bend. Neighbors .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:26 EST, 25 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:26 EST, 25 October 2012 . A tenth baby has died in the biggest outbreak of whooping cough for 20 years, health officials said today. There were 1,322 confirmed cases in England and Wales in September alone, 300 more than the total figure for 2011 when there were 1,118 cases, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said. They added that there were 6,121 confirmed cases between January and September this year. Babies are given a whooping cough jab when they are eight weeks old, but now the Government recommends vaccinating pregnant women . In total, 10 infants aged under three months have died in England as a result of the infectious disease. Last month the Government said it will offer the whooping cough vaccine to all pregnant women for the first time in the hope they will pass on protection to the foetus in the womb. At present, babies are given a whooping cough jab when they are eight weeks old, followed by boosters at three and four months. They cannot have their vaccine any sooner as their immune systems are not developed enough for it to be effective.  All nine babies who died from whooping cough this year have been under the age of eight weeks. If pregnant women are given the jab, they will make antibodies – . proteins that fight infections – that are passed on to the foetus via . the placenta. This will give the baby protection for the first few weeks . of life. Mothers are being offered the jab at . between 28 and 38 weeks as experts believe this is when their antibodies . will most effectively be passed to the newborns. The Department of Health insists that . the injections are entirely safe and there is no risk they of harming . the unborn baby or cause complications in the pregnancy. Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The medical term for whooping cough is pertussis. The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough which progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive 'whooping' noise. The coughing can last for around three months. Other symptoms include raised temperature and vomiting after coughing. Whooping cough is a cyclical disease with the number of cases peaking every 3-4 years. There is currently a peak occurring. Whooping cough is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, which can be passed from person to person through droplets spread by coughs and sneezes. It can be treated successfully with antibiotics and most people make a full recovery, however measures should be taken to stop it spreading. Children with whooping cough should be kept away from school or nursery until they have taken antibiotics for five days. The same applies to adults returning to their workplace. Young babies under the age of six months are likely to be admitted to hospital as they are most at risk of severe complications, such as serious breathing difficulties. They will be treated in isolation to prevent the infection spreading and will be given antibiotics into a vein through a drip (intravenously).Source: NHS Choices .","There were 1,322 confirmed whooping cough cases in England and Wales in September alone .

'Rich with historical appeal': The gold ingot which is set to go on sale at Bonhams in Los Angeles, California, next month . A gold bar recovered from a ship that sank during the Californian Gold Rush is up for auction - with an estimate set at 211 times it's original value. The ingot, which weighs 40oz and is expected to sell for about $140,000, was part of a 10-ton hoard of gold that went down with the SS Central America in 1857. At the time, the cargo was worth $2million and its loss during a hurricane contributed to the ‘Panic of 1857’ - the world’s first world-wide economic crisis. In 1987 much of the hoard was recovered from the seabed after the so-called ‘Ship of Gold’ was discovered in the Atlantic. The . epic discovery sparked a nine year legal battle after a host of . insurance companies that paid out for the loss 155 years ago claimed . ownership. But it was ruled . that 92 per cent of the bullion should be awarded to the discovery . team, led by Tommy Thompson, whose company Columbus-America Discovery . Group found the ship. Now this Kellog and Humbert ingot from the ship is to be sold at auction. Stamped on its base is the bar’s original value of $743.70 along with ‘Kellog and Humbert’. The reverse is a plain casting save for the serial number 648 repeated at the top. Paul . Song, director of the rare coins department at auctioneers Bonhams, . said: 'This is a highly impressive example that sports gleaming . yellow-gold colour and few imperfections as made. 'It is a piece rich with historical appeal that is an indelible link to the great Californian Gold Rush. 'This . lot includes a certificate of authenticity from the Columbus-America . Discovery Group and signed by Tommy Thompson, indicating it was . recovered from the SS Central America. 'We are delighted to offer such a rare and unusual piece related to the Gold Rush.' This engraving shows the sinking of the SS Central America, which sank in a storm of the coast of the Carolinas with the loss of 426 lives and £1.3million worth of gold cargo . The . gold ship, a 278ft-long sidewheel steamer, had 578 passengers and crew . on board when she left the Panamanian port of Colon on September 3 1857, . bound for New York under the command of William Lewis Herndon. After . a stop in Havana, she continued north up the U.S. east coast until, on . September 9, she was caught in a Category 2 hurricane off the coast of . the Carolinas. After two . days rocked by the fierce tempest, the Central America's sails were . shredded, she was taking on water, and her boiler was on the verge of . being extinguished. Her fate . was sealed when one of the seals to the paddle wheels sprang a leak . and, by noon that day, her engineers could keep the boiler's fire . burning no longer. The resulting fall in steam pressure . shut down both the pumps that were keeping water at bay and the paddle . wheels that had kept her bow to the wind. In . an attempt to draw attention to their plight, passengers and crew flew . the ship's flag upside down, a universal sign of distress, to try to . signal a passing ship. None came. A bucket brigade was formed and her passengers and crew spent the night fighting a losing battle against the rising water. Treasures: These gold nuggets, bars and coins from the SS Central America lay on the ocean floor for over 140 years until their recovery in 1987 by U.S. firm Columbus-America Discovery Group . The SS Central America was recovered by Ohio-based treasure hunters Columbus America Discovery Group using a remote-controlled submarine in 1987. The group, led by Tommy Thompson, located the wreck using Bayesian search theory, where a number of factors are taken into account direct the search for lost objects. Significant amounts of gold and other artifacts were then recovered and brought to the surface using another remote-controlled sub built specifically for the recovery. After the Mr Thompson announced the find, 39 insurance companies filed a suit claiming they had a right to the gold, on the grounds that they had paid out the damages for its loss in the 19th Century. The team that found it argued in court that the gold had been abandoned and, after a legal battle, they were awarded 92 per cent of the treasure trove in 1996. The total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $150million. One recovered ingot weighing 80lb sold for a record $8million and was recognised as the most valuable piece of currency in the world at that time. As the ship passed the eye of the storm, engineers made vain attempts to relight the boiler. The second half of the storm then . struck. Without power the Central America was carried along with the . hurricane, unable to escape the powerful winds. The . next morning two ships were spotted and 153 passengers, mainly women . and children, managed to make their way over in lifeboats. However . the intense winds and heavy seas pulled the Central America and the . rest of her company away from any hope of rescue. By 8pm that night, the . ship sank with them - and her precious cargo - still aboard. When she left on her fateful journey . the value of the gold was $2million. When the cargo was brought up the . gold recovered was estimated to be worth as much as $150million. Also being sold at the same auction . are two rare $50 gold coins that were struck in 1915 to celebrate the . completion of the Panama Canal. A . rare round version of the Panama-Pacific Exposition coin is expected to . sell for $80,000 and an octagonal coin attached to a gold chain with a . key at one end and corkscrew at the other is tipped to sell for $20,000. The auction takes place at Bonhams in Los Angeles, California, on September 2. Also up for grabs: These two rare $50 gold coins, struck in 1915 to celebrated the completion of the Panama Canal, are expected to reach £50,000 when they go under the hammer .",Loss of the ship led to 'Panic of 1857' - the first world-wide financial crisis .

Nearly 1,900 firefighters were . battling the blaze in rugged, densely forested terrain as it threatened . 3,500 homes in the towns of Manton, Shingletown and Viola, about 170 . miles north of Sacramento. ‘These . are the largest number of homes we've had threatened so far this year,’ state fire spokesman Daniel Berlant said. ‘The grass, brush and timber . up here are so dry, and once the lightning with no rain struck, the . flames began to spread quickly.’ The . fire has destroyed seven homes while blackening more than 25 square . miles. It was just 30 per cent contained after beginning Saturday. The fire forced the closure of Highway 44 and other roads, and prompted the declaration of an emergency in Shasta County. The . Red Cross set up an evacuation center at a sports complex in Redding, . where dozens of people, from the elderly to infants, as well as about a . dozen dogs, were given refuge. One . evacuee, Bonnie Maloy, who escaped her home in Shingleton, along with . her husband Bill, described the scene as they fled the flames. ‘Frantic at first, then I said, “Let's . calm down,” and we got everything that's important, things we couldn't . replace: animals, kids, photo albums,’ she said.

An airline magnate told a court today how he paid for crooked tycoon Asil Nadir to live in luxury as he defended himself against £29million theft charges. Turkish . businessman Hamat Bagana, gave 70-year-old-Nadir a total of £4.5m, which was . used to rent a Mayfair townhouse, pay lawyers’ bills and buy a £44,000 . silver Range Rover Vogue for his 28-year-old wife Nur. The 71- year- old, said it had been an ‘honour and a . privilege’ and his ‘moral duty’ to support Nadir, who was a ‘hero’ to . his generation. Facing charged: 70-year-old-Asil Nadir with his 28-year-old wife Nur . Nadir, now 70, claims he has been penniless since the collapse of his Polly Peck business empire in the early 1990s and has not had a bank account or credit card since. Prosecutors say this represents a ‘straightforward sham’ designed to hide his true wealth from the authorities. Nadir is fighting attempts to reclaim nearly £29m he was convicted of stealing from the firm earlier this year following a mammoth seven-month trial. He was originally due to stand trial over the missing millions in 1993, but fled to his native norther Cyprus before the case against him began. Mr Bagana, who owns Turksih airline Onur Air, claims he handed over £4.5m to the former Polly Peck boss as a gesture of generosity for promoting business in Turkey and northern Cyprus. Mr Bagana, who first met Nadir around 25 years ago, said: ‘When Mr Nadir made the decision to return to London he asked me a question. Respect: Airline magnate Hamat Bagana said he paid for crooked tycoon Asil Nadir to live in luxury because he was a 'hero' ‘He said this is going to be a long and expensive process. ‘He said, “I don’t have the resources to provide for that process."" ‘Then he asked me whether I would support him, help him in that respect and I answered him by saying I would do that. ‘A second matter was related to the living standards in London. ‘Because I was going to provide the finances for that purpose he asked me this question, not quite so directly but in a way. 'I answered him by saying, “When you return to London you must live by the standards that you had in the past when you used to live in London, that you have been used to. ‘”I will provide the finances to make sure you are able to do that.' 'However, I was personally against his idea of coming back to London.’ Asked what had expected to get out of giving Nadir the money, he replied: ‘He didn’t give me anything other than his friendship.’ Questioned further about his motives, he said: ‘Mr Nadir is a hero to my generation. ‘The initiatives he started in both northern Cyprus and Turkey in his time have been responsible for the current economic success of both countries, which he did under the umbrella of his company PPI.’ Mr Bagana told the court he had visited Nadir’s northern Cyprus home several times and had found it to be ‘tastefully furnished but chiefly economical.’ The two discussed wine and champagne, business and politics, he added. Nadir claims the only work he has done since 1993 is to work as a modestly-paid consultant for the Cyprus Today newspaper. At the conclusion of his trial in August this year, Nadir was convicted of 10 counts of theft relating to the disappearance of £28.89m - around £61.6m in today’s money - between 1987 and 1990. He was cleared of three counts alleging he stole £6.5m. Nadir, of Eaton Square, Belgravia, central London, denied 13 specimen counts of theft. Prosecutors said the specimen represented the theft of £146,050,000 and US$6,424,724 through 64 transactions. Mr Bagana is trying to retrieve the £250,000 security he paid for Nadir’s bail on his return to the UK. Later, Nadir’s sister Bilge Nevzat gave evidence by videolink from Northern Cyprus. She said Nadir had not worked while in exile. She said: 'He was stuck in half an island that was not recognised by anyone.' The hearing was adjourned to Friday. After the case, Nadir’s wife Nur, 28, said reports that she was in Jordan were untrue. She said: 'I am in Cyprus and I am thinking of moving to Istanbul.'

'Disturbing': Kasik is accused of threatening to kill his daughter's volleyball coach and rape members of his family . A father has been accused of threatening to kill a high school volleyball coach and rape members of his family after his daughter was put on the bench during a game. John J Kasik, 61, allegedly lost his temper when his daughter was taken off the court and replaced by her sister during a volleyball game at her high school in Chicago, U.S. Furious Kasik is said to have followed the school's athletic director to his home after the game and shouted that he would kill him, before leaving a string of sinister text messages and voicemails for the coach of the team - including one in which he threatened to rape his wife and daughter. Kasik, of Lisle, Illinois, has been . charged with telephone harassment, battery and disorderly conduct . following the 'disturbing' incidents, according to DuPage County State's . Attorney Robert Berlin. 'It's disturbing for a number of reasons,' Mr Berlin told the Chicago Tribune. 'It's a parent obviously not using good judgment.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:10 EST, 14 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:56 EST, 14 August 2012 . A woman claiming to be Chad 'Ochocinco' Johnson's former mistress has revealed they had a four-month relationship earlier this year as his now-wife Evelyn Lozada planned their wedding. Beverly Shiner, 30, told RadarOnline  she first contacted Johnson through Twitter and they went on have a passionate affair from January to May behind his fiancée's back. The claim comes just days after Johnson was arrested for allegedly headbutting his wife of a month after she confronted him over a receipt for condoms she found in his car. And, if these latest claims are to be believed, it seems Lozada, who married Johnson in July, was justified in fearing her husband was cheating on her. 'Mistress': Beverly Shiner, a 30-year-old mother of two from Boston, said she had a four-month affair with NFL player Chad Johnson while he was engaged to Evelyn Lozada, who he is accused of attacking . Shiner, a mother of two from Boston, said she enjoyed a four-month relationship with Johnson, who asked her out for dinner after she contacted him on Twitter. 'I Googled him before we met and saw he was engaged, but at the time there were reports that she had broken it off because she thought he was cheating, so I assumed they had split up,' she said. Despite later discovering women's toiletries in the bathroom of his Foxborough, Massachusetts home and realising he was still engaged, Shiner said she still slept with him. Johnson took little care to hide their affair, Shiner said. As he watched the Super Bowl with his wife and children, he was texting his mistress 'saying he was missing me', she claimed. Not-so-happy couple: Shiner claims they were conducting the affair while Johnson was engaged. He married Evelyn Lozada on July 4 at Le Chateau des Palmiers on the island of St. Maarten . Shiner added that she too had little respect for Evelyn, who she followed on Twitter to find out when she was out of town. Once she overheard Johnson treating his wife-to-be dismally, she said. 'He called Evelyn and asked if she could order a pizza to be delivered for him, and even had her pay for it on her credit card,' she said. 'I thought it was odd and wondered if she was really his fiancee or just a secretary.' But the affair ended in May after the couple spent a 'passionate night together', according to RadarOnline. As she went to visit him again at his home, he did not respond to her calls, she said. She arrived at his house and could hear him inside, but he refused to let her in. When the spoke the next day, he wouldn't apologise and claimed he had been sleeping, she said. 'I got upset and told him, ""You are not the guy I thought you were""', she said. He responded: 'You’re overstepping your boundaries a little bit. I’m not your man, keep your comments to yourself,' she said. Released: NFL star Chad Johnson bonded out of . jail 16 hours after being arrested for allegedly headbutting his new . wife Evelyn Lozada, right, outside their home in Davie, Florida on . Saturday night . Despite this treatment, Shiner said Johnson truly cared for her and told her he wanted to move in with her and have children together. He said he did not care if his fiance found out about the affair. 'He said, ""I’m not doing anything different than what every other man is doing,2 he thinks it is fine to cheat. I feel he was completely disrespectful and he led me on,' she said. Johnson's lawyer did not respond to a request from MailOnline for a comment on the allegations. They come as Lozada, who stars in Basketball Wives, spoke out for the first time since the alleged attack on Saturday night in Miami, Florida, and it was revealed she has filed for a divorce. After Johnson allegedly headbutted . Lozada, he has since been kicked out of the Miami Dolphins and VH1 dropped the . couple's reality TV series, Ev and Ocho. 'I am deeply disappointed that Chad has failed to take responsibility for his actions and made false accusations against me,' Lozada said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight. Charged: Johnson has been charged with battery . and domestic violence. According to the police report, his wife fled to a . neighbour's house fearing for her safety after Johnson attacked her . 'It is my sincere hope that he seeks the help he needs to overcome his troubles. Domestic violence is not okay and hopefully my taking a stand will help encourage other women to break their silence.' Allegations: Dolphins star Chad 'Ochocino Johnson' has been charged with headbutting his new wife in a car in Davie, Florida . TMZ reported that she filed for divorce after just six weeks of marriage, claiming their marriage was 'irretrievably broken'. Johnson . and his wife were at dinner when she confronted him about a receipt she . had found for a box of condoms, said Davie police Capt Dale Engle. The argument got heated and continued on the drive home, he said. When they arrived in their driveway in Davie, the 34-year-old Johnson head-butted Lozada, she told police. According . to the police report, Johnson started screaming at his wife, yelling, . ‘I don’t give a f***! I don’t give a f*** about my career!’ Fearing for her safety, Lozada fled to a neighbour’s house and called 911 from there. In newly-released 911 call recordings, an unidentified male neighbor is heard . speaking in hushed tones as he urges . emergency operators to send police to his home but to avoid alerting the . press. 'I have somebody here at my house . that was in a little domestic dispute with their husband and I think we . need to have a police officer come over here and talk to her,' the . neighbor says. He says . that the woman had a . 'nice cut on her forehead'. 'I think it was just a misunderstanding but we're worried that he's going to come and get upset,' the neighbor explains in tapes on the The Miami Herald. 'I don't want the police to come with their lights on but I just want them to come until everybody calms down.' Court appearance: Johnson appeared at Broward County court on Sunday morning, where he was charged with battery and domestic violence and had his bond set at $2,500 by Judge Mindy Solomon . The responding officer who filed the . report said that Johnson admitted to having an argument but said that . Lozada had head-butted him. Lozada sustained a 3 inch laceration . on her head while Johnson suffered no injuries. She was treated at a . hospital for the cut to her forehead. Johnson, . who changed his last name back to Johnson from Ochocinco after his July . 4 wedding to Lozada, was held Saturday night in Broward County Jail. He . was at 1 p.m. on Sunday on $2,500 bond after appearing in court that . morning, where he was charged with battery and domestic violence. His defense attorney, Adam Swickle, said a no-contact order has been issued that prevents Johnson from contacting Lozada. It . is not the first time Johnson has been accused of attacking a woman, as . he was found guilty of hitting an ex girlfriend 12 years ago, when she . accused him of cheating on her, TMZ reported. Lovers' quarrel: The argument that ended in Johnson's arrest broke out when his wife, Evelyn Lozada, left, confronted him about finding a receipt for condoms . Johnson was arrested for misdemeanor domestic battery in L.A. on . February 7, 2000 when he was 22 and just about to start playing football for Oregon . State University, the website reported. He . was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to serve 45 days in . jail, but he struck a deal that allowed him to avoid the jail sentence . for community work. He was . also required to complete a 12 month batterer's counseling program, . which TMZ reported he failed to complete for years until the judge gave . him more community service. He has since . stayed out of trouble with the law – a fact he mentions in his 2007 . autobiography Ocho Cinco: What Football And Life Have Thrown My Way, . according to the site SB Nation. In a passage addressing an alleged . altercation with an NFL employee, Johnson writes: ‘You see, the . funniest part is that people think I’m so bad, but do you see one arrest . on me since I got to the NFL? 'Do you see me getting suspended for using . drugs or steroids? Do you see anything about me beating up my . girlfriend or some other guys? No, none of that.’ Switching teams: Johnson signed with the Dolphins in June, four days after he was released by the New England Patriots . Johnson signed a one-year deal with . the Miami Dolphins - worth just under $1million - in June to revive his . career after he was released by the New England Patriots - but the . Dolphins have now cut ties with the wide receiver, after team officials . met with him following his release from jail. The team announced via the team's website and Twitter late Sunday that they terminated Johnson's contract. A six-time Pro . Bowl receiver with Cincinnati, he caught only 15 passes in 15 games for . the Patriots last year after they acquired him in a trade for a pair of . draft picks.

A mother and father will stand trial for child abuse after two of their children were found bound and blindfolded in a Walmart parking lot, a practice the couple claimed was to guard against demons. Adolfo Gomez, 52, and his 44-year-old wife Deborah were jailed on June 13 when police . found two of their children - a boy, five, and his seven-year-old sister - tied up and with duct . tape over their eyes outside a Walmart in Lawrence, Kansas. Both will be tried on two counts on child abuse, Douglas County Judge Paula Martin ruled on Tuesday. Mr Gomez faces an additional count of obstruction for resisting arrest. The Gomezs' three other children, aged 12, 13 and 15, were in the family's SUV unrestrained. All the children are now in protective custody. Scroll down for video . Adolfo Gomez (left) and his wife Deborah Gomez were arrested after police discovered two of their five children bound and blindfolded in the parking lot of a Walmart store in Kansas . Five other charges of aggravated endangerment were due to be refiled by the district attorney before the couple's arraignment. The Gomezs next appear in court on Thursday. The pair sat in . court on Tuesday in orange jail pants and T-shirts and appeared to be . listening intently to the testimony. Police Detective Randy Glidewell . testified that when he interviewed Adolfo Gomez on the day of his  arrest, the father said he had been listening to an online preacher . who was predicting the end of the world and that a 'darkness had come . over the house' where the family lived in Northlake, Illinois. 'And the world was coming to an end, and that's why they left,' Glidewell added, referring to the father's comments. The detective also said Adolfo Gomez . told him he hadn't slept in nine days, and that Gomez was particularly . concerned about one of the younger children. Gomez described the child as 'acting like he was possessed'. 'He was scared (the child) would hurt some of the kids,' the detective added. Possessed: Deborah Gomez reads court documents shortly after she was arrested when two of her children were found bound and blindfolded in a Walmart parking lot while she shopped inside . Lawrence police officer Hayden Fowler . also testified that one of the older children told him there were 'demons' in their Northlake home and outside their . SUV in the parking lot, and that the coverings on the vehicle's windows . were there to keep the demons out. Adolfo Gomez's lawyer, Skip Griffy, . said during the hearing that blindfolding and binding the younger . children was part of the family's religious beliefs, and that it was not . done frequently or as a punishment but as a way to protect the children . from demons. Mr Griffy said: 'Their actions were taken out of their religious beliefs, that these children were possessed.' He added that the children had no injuries. Angela Keck, a lawyer for Deborah . Gomez, distanced her client from Adolfo Gomez, saying the woman had no . control over her husband. Ms Keck said: 'She was doing her best . to protect herself and her children when Mr Gomez was having a kind of . religious experience. You have not heard anything that these children's . lives were in any danger in any way.' Ranting: Adolfo Gomez is arrested in Lawrence, Kansas after tying up his children out of a belief that they were possessed . However Debby Moody, assistant Douglas County district attorney said that the 'danger to these children was real'. She said: 'These types of bindings and blindfolds come into play when you're talking about ... prisoners of war.' Deborah Gomez was involved in the . abuse and when presented with an opportunity to help, 'she went shopping . for duct tape, two tarps and a baseball bat'. These were the items police discovered in the mother's shopping cart at Walmart when the children were found. The prosecutor described the tying up of the children as a 'team effort'. Officer Fowler told the court that the couple's eldest daughter told him that their parents believed her younger siblings and their home was possessed by demons. The child also said  the family had . recently watched online videos about demons and 'a fallen angel'. Case: Adolfo Gomez (pictured) and Deborah Gomez were charged in Kansas after two of their children were found bound and blindfolded at a Walmart . The older daughter said they were . going to attempt to cast the demons out the younger children but did not . say how they planned to do that. He said the daughter told him 'if the demons were to die (the children) would die also'. The family had been . traveling from Illinois to see a family member in Arizona when their SUV . broke down on Interstate 70. They stopped in Lawrence and . were in the Walmart parking lot when Linda Baranski, 64, called the . police after seeing one of the bound children outside the vehicle in the . store's parking lot. During Tuesday's hearing, Ms Baranski . testified that she noticed the child when she pulled her car into the . parking lot. She said the child was sitting 'flat on the cement, and . they were bound and I thought gagged, and they were rocking back and . forth'. 'I thought it might have been some sort of abduction,' Baranski said during her testimony. Baranski said Adolfo Gomez then caught her eye and appeared angry when he motioned for her to leave. 'He motioned in a kind of angry way . as if to say get out of here,' Baranski said. She said she then pulled . into a parking spot and called the police. Mr Gomez was standing near the vehicle when an officer approached it in response to Baranski's 911 call. 'When (the man) saw the officer, he tried to get away from him,' Lawrence police spokesman Sgt. Trent McKinley said. The . man ducked inside the vehicle and the officer, concerned that the man . could be reaching for a weapon, used a stun gun and put him in . handcuffs, McKinley said. Found: Police spotted a boy, 5, on the ground beside a van (pictured) with his hands and legs tied up and a blindfold covering his eyes . 'Unusual': Police found the children's mother inside Walmart (pictured) shopping while her daughter, 7, was inside the car also bound and blindfolded . The Gomezs had previously been . charged with child endangerment in 1998 for leaving the two children . they had at the time, aged one and two, alone in their Naperville, . Illinois apartment for up to eight hours as they worked at night. An official at the time said the case was 'among most severe cases of neglect I've seen since I've been on the job'. Deborah . Gomez, who had pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor, ran into legal . problems in 2001 for failing to take part in parenting counseling as . part of the condition of her guilty plea. Meanwhile, Adolfo Gomez has been arrested for several crimes, including three cases of driving while intoxicated. He also spent time in prison on theft and burglary charges in the 1980s.

Police arrived to find numerous underage drinkers with a beer keg, liquor bottles and cups of alcohol at the home in Durango, Colorado, . at 11.20 p.m. on Sunday, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Caught: Sydney Spies, left, shot to fame after her racy yearbook photo was rejected by her school. She has now been arrested along with her mother, Denise 'Miki' Spies, right, at a party at their home . When partygoers spotted the police, they . hopped over a chain-link fence in the back garden and ran up a steep . hill behind the house, The Durango Herald reported. Police approached Miki Spies, 45, and she allegedly refused to give her name or date of birth. She then 'broke into a full sprint for her front door', according to an incident report. Officers chased her to her bedroom where she tried to slam the door. After a struggle, she was arrested. Her daughter had allegedly tried to stop police from catching her mother. When the teen was arrested for obstructing a police officer and put in a patrol car, she attempted to escape. 'She nearly kicked me in the groin,' an officer wrote in his report about the teenager's struggle. Her mother was charged with contributing . to the delinquency of a minor and misdemeanor counts of obstructing a . police officer and resisting arrest and released on $10,000 bond. Uproar: Spies had submitted this photograph for the yearbook but the committee deemed it inappropriate . The younger Spies was also released, on $500 bond. On Facebook page on Monday evening, she posted: 'I just love being targeted. What a bunch of BS.' But it's not the first arrest for her mother, who was charged with  resisting arrest, obstructing a police officer and trespassing for making noise in a church park early on June 24, records show. As she was arrested, she began yelling that police were only called because she was a lesbian and shouted obscenities about Christians at the church's pastor, who had asked her to be quiet. As police carried her to the car, she went limp and appeared as if she had been drinking. 'She . asked how long I had been a police officer,' an officer said in the arrest report. 'I answered that I was . approaching my seventh year. She then said, ""Well, you suck at it"".' Not shy: The exposure following the scandal led to a small movie role in a Syfy movie for Spies . She has pleaded not guilty to all three charges and has a pre-trial conference on Tuesday. It . is not the sort of attention Spies wished to garner after hitting . headlines for the provocative photograph that was rejected by the . yearbook committee at Durango High School in January. When she submitted a second . photograph - of her wearing a strapless dress - the group rejected it . again, claiming she was showing too much skin, and she and her mother . challenged the decision. Amid the furor, Sydney and her mother . protested outside the school and appeared on the Today show to discuss . the photograph, which shows her wearing just a short yellow skirt and a . black shawl. 'I honestly think it describes who I . am,' Sydney told Today host Matt Lauer. 'People can take it however they . want, but I'm an outgoing person, and I really do think it's artistic.' The exposure landed the aspiring model and actress a role in a movie on the Syfy channel, which will air on Halloween. Speaking out: Sydney and her mother on the Today show after the story broke in January. Her mother allegedly tried to run away from police when they found underage drinkers in her home . Protest: The Spies challenged the yearbook committee decision by protesting outside the school . She will play a character named 'Missy' in . the science-fiction station for a movie called . American Horror House, Spies revealed earlier this year. Sydney Spies told the Westwood newspaper in Denver: 'The head of the Syfy network said he wanted me to be in a movie. So they got hold of me and my mom and flew me out to Louisiana.' She has now completed her senior year but decided not to attend her graduation ceremony. Instead, she has been focusing on her prospective career as a model and actress although these latest photographs - mugshots - are perhaps not what she had in mind.

His wife Hannah, 32 - who has fought cancer twice - has remained at Northside Hospital in Cumming, Georgia, since July 2, after a rare bacterial infection ravaged her body. To save her life, Mark had to make . the heartbreaking decision to allow doctors to amputate her hands and . feet after she suffered circulatory problems and went into septic shock. Scroll down for video . Battle: Hannah Rinehart, pictured with her husband Mark and their dog Brownie, has had both hands and feet removed after she caught a rare infection from the puppy's saliva . Mr Rinehart, a high school teacher and member of the Georgia Army National Guard, knows that when his wife gets out of the hospital, he needs to be there for her day in and day out. But with just 20 sick days, his fellow teachers stepped up, donating their own time off so he can care for his wife at home, while still collecting a paycheck and health benefits. But the school district has no policy in place that will allow Mr Rinehart to use the donated days. Rinehart was joined by friends, family and colleagues at a school board meeting on Thursday night, where he pleaded with Gwinnett County Public Schools to allow for him to use the time off. According to Snellville Patch, Mrs Rinehart's father, Doug Johnson, told the board: 'As a little girl, [Hannah] would run and jump into my arms and give me a great big hug. 'Unfortunately that little girl no longer has hands or feet. In fact, she is currently fighting for her life in the ICU of Northside hospital.' District spokeswoman Sloan Roach told CBS Atlanta that allowing Mr Rinehart to use the donated days would change policy, and the district would have to take the its 22,000 employees into consideration. Fighter: Hannah was more susceptible to the infection as her immune system was weakened by two bouts of cancer - Hodgkin's lymphoma - and subsequent bone marrow transplants . Struck down: She has been in hospital for almost a month after being admitted with a temperature of 103 . The school board did not vote on the . policy change at Friday's meeting, but have said they are working with . the district's human resources department to see what can be done. Mr Rinehart said in a blog post on Saturday night that he has not heard any news from the board its decision. Meanwhile, Hannah Rinehart's recovery is continuing. Hannah Rinehart became ill after contracting capnocytophaga. It had a significant effect as her immune system had been weakened by cancer and two bone marrow transplants. The rare infection is only usually a danger to elderly, infirm or those with underlying diseases. Capnocytophaga is found in the throat of mammals and can be passed to humans through bite wounds. The bacteria can cause septicemia, meningitis, rare eye infections and endocarditis - an inflammation of the heart. Symptoms often include fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, confusion, muscle pain or malaise. It can also bring on septic shock. When discovered, it can be treated with anti-microbial medications. Doctors believe she contracted capnocytophaga, . an infection usually found in the saliva of dogs. Mr Rinehart said he . did not know if their one-year-old puppy, Brownie, bit her. Hannah has beaten cancer twice since the age of 18; she suffered twice from Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was in remission for seven years. She underwent two bone marrow transplants, which weakened her immune system and made her more susceptible to the bacteria, MyFoxAtlanta reported. Despite these struggles, her husband, a schoolteacher and national guardsman, said she has always been upbeat. 'You see people around who have had a . tough time and are bitter about it,' Mr Rinehart told WXIA. 'She's not; she's . always excited about living. She's a fighter, I married a fighter. 'It's just another stage in our life. I know when she comes out of this she's going to . be smiling just as big as she was before.' Another issue affecting the Rinharts is the cost of her care when she is out of the hospital, including prosthetic devices and alterations to their home and vehicles. A fundraiser that will include an auction and blood drive is scheduled for September 29 at the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Atlanta. Donations are also being accepted by Operation Appreciation, an outreach organisation dedicated to supporting the members of the Georgia Army National Guard, at www.OperationAppreciation.org. Source: Doctors believe she contracted capnocytophaga from their dog as it lurks in animals' mouths . Positive: Her husband Mark said he knows Hannah will be grateful just to be alive and appreciate every day . Mr Rinehart said he has been given support and advice from other families who have also endured quadruple amputations and looks forward to being in touch with more. 'We are loved and supported by so many . people I can't begin to send thank yous out but I can keep trying,' Mr . Rinehart, who has been sleeping in the hospital, said.

A third of the fish caught in British waters are being landed abroad by foreign fishermen, it was claimed yesterday. Trawlers owned abroad – but flying British flags – are accused of taking the fish away from the country in a flagrant abuse of our strict quota system. Across Europe fish stocks are in long-term decline, with current British levels estimated to be 90 per cent lower than a century ago. Abusing the system: Foriegn-owned trawlers are accused of taking fish away from Britain . Many blame the Spanish for accelerating the process. The foreign fishing companies are allowed to register their vessels in the UK and then buy or lease fishing quotas that were meant to be for British boats. It is reported that, under this system, just five Spanish ships registered in one county are allowed to catch more hake in British waters than the entire Scottish trawler fleet. The Spanish vessels reportedly have quotas for 1,650 tons of hake, compared with the Scottish fleet’s allowance of 1,570 tons. According to government records, the five ships are part of 15 Spanish-controlled trawlers ‘based’ in Fleetwood, Lancashire – but which are said to never land their catch there. One of the vessels registered in the once-thriving port is the O Genita, which fishes from a UK quota. It is owned by the Vidal family, who were recently ordered to pay fines and costs of £1.62million for illegal fishing. A judge at Truro Crown Court (above) last month accused a group of foreign skippers and employers of 'systematic and repeated abuse' of limits imposed to protect British fish stocks . Passing the sentence at Truro Crown Court in Cornwall last month, Judge Graham Cottle accused the skippers and their employers of ‘systematic, repeated and cynical abuse’ of the limits imposed to protect British fish stocks. According to the latest figures compiled by the Marine Management Organisation, British-registered fishing boats landed 606,000 tons of sea fish in the UK and abroad last year, worth £719million. About a third of this – 196,000 tons – was landed overseas. Critics say that even when foreign boats land their catch in British ports, the fish are loaded straight into lorries and taken abroad. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘It is vital that Britain continues to receive a benefit from all UK registered boats. We are reviewing the policy to ensure this remains the case.’",Current British fish stocks 90 per cent lower than a century ago .

A homeowner who stabbed a burglar to death has spoken of how the terrifying night has destroyed his life and he has been left dependent on a cocktail of medication to help deal with the trauma. Vincent Cooke, 40, was confronted on his doorstep by two thugs who then forced their way into his £350,000 home in the Cheshire stockbroker belt last year. In the struggle that ensued, Mr Cooke grabbed a carving knife to protect himself and fatally stabbed 37-year-old robber Raymond Jacob. Earlier this month a judge sentenced his accomplice Michael Thorpe, 34, to ten years in jail for aggravated burglary. Last night Mr Cooke, who now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, described how the terrifying confrontation last September has ruined his life. 'If you'd said to me a year ago that I would kill a man, I would never had believed it.' Mr Cooke is now on anti-depressants, sleeping tablets, beta-blockers and painkillers to help him deal with the terrifying ordeal. 'I used to love coming home from work and preparing dinner for my family. Now I can’t even see a knife without recoiling.' He said that if we watches a TV programme with blood in, he will suffer from nightmares, waking up screaming and sweating. He explained he can go without sleep for days, mulling over what would have happened if he had done something differently. Mr Cooke, a boss of a courier firm, said he is desperate to go back to work, but is currently too tired to return. After the stabbing Mr Cooke, who said he acted in lawful self defence, was questioned for 12 hours and later released without charge but was kept on bail for almost a month until he was told he would not be charged. Vincent eventually grabbed a kitchen knife to protect himself and fatally stabbed 37-year-old robber Raymond Jacob  left.  Accomplice, Michael Thorpe, 34,  right, was recently jailed for ten years for aggravated burglary . He and his family have since left their luxury home after suffering nightmares about the tragedy and have only just returned six weeks ago. Mr Cooke had been at his his £350,000 home in Bramhall, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, last September watching an evening film when he heard the door bell ring. He thought it was his wife Karen, his wife of 14 years, returning from picking up their 13-year-old son Anthony from a friend's house. He described how he joked in high-pitched voice 'Who is it?' and the answer was 'Gas.' Scene of ordeal: Mr Cooke was confronted on his doorstep by two thugs who then forced their way into his £350,000 home in the Cheshire stockbroker belt last year . Mr Cooke said the door buckled as it was kicked in and the men who had had hoods over their faces demanded to know where his wife and son were and told him they knew he had money in a safe as well as jewellery and a Rolex. Mr Cooke was surprised at the level of detail the men knew about his life, but at the trial it emerged that the raiders had been given information about Mr Cooke’s safe from the victim’s uncle who helped him run a transport storage firm. After being frogmarched around the four-bedroom home to look for valuables, Mr Cooke was opening the safe when Karen and his son Anthony, 13, returned home and stumbled on the robbery. Mrs Cooke who is also now on anti-depressants and suffers panic attacks, recalled: 'Vinnie shouted at me, ""We are being robbed. There are two of them. They have knives. Get out.’""I grabbed Anthony, screaming, and ran to a neighbour, who called 999.' Mr Cooke said that was when Jacob started to attack him and lunged at him with a knife. He managed to twist away from him and grabbed a kitchen knife from a set left on the windowsill. He recalled: 'I didn’t choose the carving knife — but in a way I am pleased I did or it would be me that was dead.' Mourning: A friend of Jacob is comforted by another as she lays flowers at the scene of the stabbing last year . Mr Cooke -  who was also stabbed in the scuffle -  said he knew he had nicked him a couple of times, but due to the thick jacket Jacob was wearing he was not sure if it had just gone into the material. During the trial the court heard Mr Cooke explained 'I felt like I was now fighting for my life, if I did not stab him first he would stab and kill me.' Mr Cooke managed to break free but then heard screaming and saw Jacob fighting for his life and dialled 999. Paramedics were unable to revive Jacob and he was declared dead at the scene. Thorpe was arrested later after a neighbour spotted him fleeing the scene in a Citroen Berlingo and made a note of the registration plate. He later claimed he and Jacob had been invited into the house by Mr Cooke to discuss a business deal importing trainers, but a violent row broke out and Jacob was killed. Police forensic investigators outside the home in Bramhall, Greater Manchester, where Jacob died of knife injuries after an attempted burglary . During the trial Mark Kellet, prosecuting said: 'In a victim impact statement from Karen it said stress and anxiety had been caused to the whole family caused by having men in the house. 'It had an effect in terms of mental health and a financial impact and impacted Anthony in particular and they had to move out of the area at a time when Anthony was involved in GCSE’s. Moving away from family and friends has a significant impact on him and what happened to his house.' Jacob had dozens of convictions for burglary, robbery and theft. He once served an 18-month prison sentence for beating a man unconscious and leaving him looking 'like a piece of meat'. In a statement issued at the time he was vindicated Mr Cooke said: 'I hope to now be able to get on with my life but will never forget the day that I had to fight for my life. 'I just want to get my life back on track. I’m still very traumatised by what happened. I’m still having nightmares every night about this incident.' Earlier this month a judge sentenced his accomplice Micheal Thorpe to ten years in jail for aggravated burglary. Passing sentence, Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told Thorpe: 'For anyone who lends themselves to an enterprise of this nature, it would be perfectly obvious that you would scare the victim with a knife by brandishing it and it was foreseeable that it might be used. 'It is natural to put up a fight, that is what happened in the kitchen, the complainant came upon a knife, not surprisingly in the kitchen, and sought to defend himself and his property and it was after that struggle between the two men that your accomplice was stabbed.'Judge Mushtaq Khokhar .

The first wife of Ian Huntley says she is determined to make the Soham murderer's time in prison as tough as possible as she spoke about finally moving on with her life. Claire Evans said she was 'not going to go away' and vowed to continue campaigning to have the killer's luxuries taken away from his cell in Frankland Prison. She also told how she wanted to set the record straight about 'lies' she believes she has been subjected to in the ten years since the murders of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.

Ms Evans, 36, endured years of physical and mental abuse at the hands of Huntley, now 38. He sexually assaulted her, attacked her in the shower and hacked off her hair so that no other man would find her ­attractive. She was even forced to abort their baby after Huntley ­threatened: 'Have that child and I’ll do things to it.' Ms Evans, who has since married for a . third time and is now a mother of two, told in an earlier interview with . the Sunday Mirror how 17 years ago Huntley came within seconds of . killing her as he tried to crush her windpipe. Speaking to ITV's This Morning, Ms Evans, 36, said she only now had the strength to give her version of events. 'It's hard. But at least this is my side of the story - at least its the truth that's being told this time, at least its not a pack of lies that's out there...

'I need to move on for my children's sake. I have to put my children first.' The pair met in 1994, eight years before the murders of Holly and Jessica, while they were both working in a food factory in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. Huntley, then 20, was a cleaner while Ms Evans, who was 18, worked as a ­production operator. They kissed at the factory's Christmas party and a whirlwind romance followed. Within days Ms Evans had moved into Huntley’s one-bedroom flat and a month later he had proposed. Killer: Huntley is serving two life sentences with a minimum of 40 years for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman . The pair got married in January 1995, and soon after the relationship soon became abusive and his behaviour increasingly more bizarre and psychotic. She said: '(After the wedding day), we . got home - and everyone's got a different sense of humour... and I was . being sick and he poured a bottle of alcohol over me... he laughed. 'You could put it down to sense of . humour, it wasn't my sense of humour but it was his sense of humour.

Ms Evans told how she went from a healthy size 12 to a minuscule size four because of the stress. But although she felt trapped, she believed she had no alternative but to stick with Huntley. Killed in Huntley's bathroom: Cambridgeshire schoolgirls Holly Wells (left) and Jessica Chapman, in Manchester United football shirts . She has also revealed she was forced to make the heart-breaking decision to have a termination to abort his child - because she was so scared about what Huntley would do to it. When Huntley eventually found out about the termination, he beat her up. He finally granted Ms Evans a divorce in 1999. She married his brother Wayne in July 2000, but that relationship ended four years later. By 2002, Huntley had got together with Maxine Carr, 35, and the pair moved to ­Soham, Cambridgeshire, where he got a job as a school caretaker and was living in a house in the grounds. On August 4, when Holly and Jessica went out to buy some sweets, they passed Huntley’s house.

A New Jersey teenager left permanently brain-damaged after being struck by a baseball off a metal bat will receive $14.5million in a lawsuit settlement announced on Wednesday with Little League Baseball, a sporting goods chain and a bat manufacturer. Steven Domalewski was 12 years old when he was struck in the chest by a drive line while pitching in a youth game in 2006. The hit caused his heart to stop for more than 15 minutes, resulting in a severe damage to his brain. Domalewski, now 18 years old, lives in Wayne, New Jersey. His family had claimed the metal bat used in the game was unsafe because baseballs could carom off it at much faster speeds than wooden bats. Closure: Steven Domalewski, center, and his parents, reached a $14.5million settlement with a bat manufacturer, Little League Baseball and a sporting goods chain over his 2006 injury . ‘The Domalewskis are still saddened by the tragic events of June 2006, but this settlement provides them with some relief and comfort that Steven will get the care he needs for the rest of his life,’"" said the family's attorney, Ernest Fronzuto. ‘He still can't perform any functions of daily life on his own.’ Stephen D. Keener, president and CEO of Little League Baseball Inc., said the settlement guarantees that ‘Steven Domalewski will receive the lifetime care he will require as a result of this tragic accident, a type of accident that is extremely rare in youth baseball.’ Game gone wrong: Steven was 12 years old when he got hit in the chest by a line drive while pitching in a youth baseball game in 2006 . Fronzuto said the settlement precluded him from discussing its details, including whether any of the defendants admitted liability. On June 6, 2006, Domalewski was pitching when the batter rocketed a line drive off the metal bat he was swinging. The ball slammed into Steven's chest, just above his heart, knocking him backward. He clutched his chest, then made a motion to reach for the ball on the ground to pick it up and throw to first base to get the runner out. But he never made it that far. The ball had struck his chest at the precise millisecond between heartbeats, sending him into cardiac arrest, according to his doctors. He crumpled to the ground and stopped breathing. His father, Joseph, a teacher who had been on the sideline with the rest of the team, said he and a third base coach from the other team both ran onto the field, where Steven was already turning blue. Someone yelled, ‘Call 911!’ Within 90 seconds, a man trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation who had been playing catch with his nine-year-old daughter jumped over the fence and started to work on Steven. Paramedics got to Steven within minutes, placed an oxygen mask over his face and rushed him to a hospital. But the damage had been done; his brain had been without oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes. Bad timing: The ball struck Steven, right, in the chest in the millisecond between heartbeats, sending him into cardiac arrest and depriving his brain of oxygen for 15-20 minutes . Life derailed: The 18-year-old boy has a very limited vocabulary and has to attend a school for special needs children in Clifton . ‘Pretty much, he died,’ Joseph Domalewski said in a 2008 interview with The Associated Press. ‘It was just so fast. The thud, you could hear. When it hit him, that seemed to echo.’ Domalewski was playing in a Police Athletic League game, but Little League was sued because the group certifies what specific metal bats are approved for — and safe for — use in games involving children. Mr Domalewski told NorthJersey.com that the tragic accident has left his son nearly blind in one eye and with a very limited vocabulary. The teen also cannot get around without assistance and regularly sees a chiropractor and physical therapist. Steven Dombalewski’s case has made headlines nationwide and attracted attention to the controversial use of lightweight aluminum baseball bats in games involving children. Daily struggles: The injury has left Steven, left, nearly blind in one eye and unable to walk without assistance . Since 2006, several towns in northern New Jersey banned the use of non-wooden baseball bats, and the New York City Council followed suit, putting in place a similar restriction on high school games. Little League reached an agreement with the major manufacturers in the early 1990s to limit metal bats' performance to that of the best wooden bats. Little League said in 2008 that injuries to its pitchers fell from 145 a year before the accord was reached to the current level of about 20 to 30 annually. Rick Redman, a spokesman for Hillerich and Bradsby, manufacturers of the Louisville Slugger brand bat used in the fateful June 2006 game, confirmed a settlement had been reached, but declined further comment. The Domalewski family have claimed that the Little Slugger brand aluminum bat used on the day Steven got injured is much lighter that stronger than wood bats . The Domalewski family have claimed that the aluminum bat used when Steven got injured is much lighter that stronger than standard wooden bats, or even metal bats made some 30 years ago. ‘We hope that this settlement will bring about some changes,’ the family's attorney said.","Steven Domalewski was struck in the chest by a drive line at age 12 .

Quite a catch: Molly Palmer poses with the 12-foot marlin that took her and her team more than four hours to pull from the water . Cheating would have been easy and . tempting. The Big Island Invitational Marlin Tournament runs in part on . an honor system and Palmer, her captain and crewmates put up roughly . $9,000 to enter last week. But the Kailua-Kona angler said it wasn't a question of whether or not to cheat — her team just wanted to reel in the big catch. So they disqualified themselves and Palmer's crewmates helped pull the monstrous fish aboard. 'The question was only can I land the fish or not,' Palmer told The Associated Press. 'I didn't come here to set world records. I didn't even really come here to win money. I came here to catch fish and that's just what we were there to do.' Palmer's fish weighed in at 1,022.5 pounds, well over the record of 950 pounds for a woman using a 130-pound line, tournament organizer Jody Bright said. Little help: It took Mrs Palmer's entire fishing team to reel in the fish weighing a half-ton and a world record if it wasn't for a rule eliminating fish pulled up with the help of others . Officials at the International Game Fishing Association were not immediately available late Wednesday. 'I've had people try to slide things past me for a whole lot less money, for a less important thing than a world record,' Bright said. 'We don't have officials on the field like you do in baseball or football or anything like that,' he said. 'Everybody's playing on the open ocean playing field and since there's nobody there checking to see if you stepped out of bounds or any of that sort of stuff there's a whole lot of opportunity to do things nobody would know of.' Bright said most of the fish caught during the three-day tournament were released, while those that died would be sold at market for seafood and marlin jerky. Method: Mrs Palmer, seen standing beside her husband, weighs just 160 pounds and would need to get the marlin higher in the water to make it easier for her to reel in her line . Neal Isaacs, the boat's captain, said the team knew the fish was big — but not necessarily a world record — when they saw it start jumping to free itself from the line nearly 40 minutes after it was hooked. The battle then became about whether the boat could position itself to give Palmer enough leverage to reel it in, he said. She didn't want to give up, but the fish stayed in deep waters and eventually died on the line, drifting directly below the ship, Isaacs said. 'We pushed it, but her husband suggested we get out of the chair before she passed out,' Isaacs said. Angling is as much about math and physics as the open-water adventure. Palmer, at 160 pounds, needed to get the marlin more than six times her weight positioned higher in the water to make it easier for her to reel in her line without attracting sharks or breaking the line or any of the boat's equipment. 'It was a bad decision that stopped me more than my physical limits,' she said.",Molly Palmer misses a world record for her 1022.5lb fish because of a rule prohibiting her from not reeling it in herself .

A quick thinking schoolboy has been hailed a hero after rescuing a little girl from a runaway car rolling toward a busy main road. Seamus Buckley, 14, leapt into action when he saw the driverless car on a collision course with a four-year-old girl fastened in a safety seat. Seamus managed to free the terrified girl, jump in the car and pull the handbrake on before the car reached the main road junction in Dalton, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire yesterday. Quick thinking hero: Seamus Buckley, 14, leapt into action to save a four-year-old girl trapped in a driverless car rolling toward a busy intersection . The girl’s mother had left the car momentarily to dash into a pharmacy to collect a prescription when the drama unfolded. Seamus had been playing football at Dalton Youth Centre when he noticed the girl screaming and banging frantically on the car window. The teenager from East Herringthorpe said: 'I’d been playing football with my mates. I was walking round to the front doors when I heard this screaming and saw the girl banging on the car window. ‘I tried to stop the car with my hands at first but couldn’t so I opened the door and told her to undo her seatbelt. ‘Then I carried her to the kerb, ran back and got in the car to put the handbrake on. ‘I didn’t really think about what I was doing as it was happening. I think it’s something anyone would have done.’ Proud father Adrian Buckley, 42, said: ‘It’s just his natural reaction - that’s him. ‘He’s easy going and doesn’t make a big deal out of things. Mother leaves car momentarily: The girl's mother left her daughter in the car to dash to the pharmacy when it started to roll toward this busy intersection . ‘He just saw the girl screaming and banging on the windows and says he did what anyone would have done.’ Youth centre leader Shaz Maxwell said the girl’s mother never leaves her daughter alone. She said: ‘The mum had just popped in to pick up a prescription and said she never normally leaves the child on her own. ‘We don’t know if she left the brake off or if the child managed to take it off. ‘The mum was so upset but she did come back later and gave him a hug and say thanks again.’ Ms Maxwell had also heard the girl’s screams but Seamus was the first to reach the girl. She said: ‘I heard the scream and went running but Seamus had got there already. ‘It was his quick thinking that saved the young girl because if the car had veered any further it’s a blind bend and it would have been hit by something coming round the corner. ‘Normally we keep the (youth centre) doors open. It’s lucky that we didn’t this time because Seamus was heading round the corner to get a drink when he noticed the car.’","Seamus Buckley, 14, rescued the girl after he heard her screaming and banging on the window of the car as it rolled toward a busy main road .

It is a move that is sure to leave Superman fans divided - and would make his former beau Lois Lane green with envy. Superman and Wonder Woman, romantically linked in the past, have finally hooked up to become the world's most powerful superhero couple. The romance follows the relaunching of several much-loved superhero characters by DC Comics last year. Power couple: Superman and Wonder Woman will officially become an item in the forthcoming Justice League comic . The story behind some much-loved characters were altered as part of the move, with Superman's relationship with former lover Lois Lane erased. Superman and Wonder Woman will finally pair up following a 'significant event' in the new comic Justice League #12, according to the Guardian. The link up will make sense to many fans, as the pair are in a line of work that requires them to hide their powers from mere mortals, while they both sometimes work very anti-social hours. Jealousy: Lois Lane (pictured left with superman) would not be impressed with news of his new relationship with Wonder Woman (right, played here by Lynda Carter) The front cover of Justice League features the two superheroes kissing in a passionate embrace. Other changes introduced for Superman by DC Comics include the death of his adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent and the end of him wearing his distinctive red pants outside his blue suit. The next Superman film, Man of Steel, is due for release next year, with British actor Henry Cavill playing the superhero in the title role. Russell Crowe will play Superman's father, Jor-El, with Amy Adams as Lois Lane. There are rumours Wonder Woman, famously played by Lynda Carter in the 1970s TV series, will also be made into a film.","Superhero favourites finally become an item after being romantically linked .

At the height of Britain's property boom, no eye-wateringly expensive farmhouse conversion was complete without a gleaming Aga in the high-spec kitchen. But in 2012, with the country still firmly in the grip of recession, sales of the pricey cast iron cookers are in decline - prompting the manufacturer to target China as a new market for growth. Announcing a sharp drop in half-year profits, Aga Rangemaster blamed the lack of activity in the property market as customers delayed buying big ticket items. Some Aga models can cost over £5,000. The firm, which also produces . fridges, sinks and stoves, said it expected markets in the UK and in . Ireland to remain tough 'for some time'. Half-year pre-tax profits at the Leamington Spa-based company were £1.6 million - compared with £4.2 million a year earlier. Revenues in the first half were 1.8 per cent lower at £119.2 million. Aga Rangemaster is planning to concentrate on boosting sales in North America as well as China in a bid to rejuvenate profits. Chief executive William McGrath said: 'With the established UK and Irish markets likely to remain weak for some time in the current economic environment, the onus is on new markets such as China and on raising market penetration in markets like North America, where our market position is not yet fully developed.' He said the firm was busy developing new products, including a five-oven electric Aga due to be launched next month, and had driven sale volumes of its classic Aga four per cent higher with the help of promotions and stock clearances over the half year. The Aga cooker was invented in Sweden in 1922.

Ministers should do more to ensure that recipients of British aid money do more to collect their own taxes properly, MPs said last night. The Commons International Development Committee said that if poorer nations collected their own taxes effectively, they would not have to rely on British taxpayers quite so much. They said a reliable flow of tax revenues offered countries a far better route out of poverty than reliance on foreign aid donations. Afghanistan war widows line up to receive monthly ration in Kabul. The Commons International Development Committee said that if poorer nations collected their own taxes effectively, they would not have to rely on foreign aid . The MPs urged the Department for International Development to support the revenue authorities in developing nations to improve the collection rates of income tax, VAT and local property taxes. While most government departments have had to endure severe cuts, but DfID is enjoying increases to take its budget up to 0.7 per cent of GDP. Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Bruce said: 'The aim of development work is to enable developing countries to escape from over-reliance on aid. 'Supporting revenue authorities is one of the best ways of doing this: it represents excellent value for money, both for the countries concerned and for UK taxpayers.' The committee said it was essential that the governing 'elites' within developing countries paid - and, critically, were seen to pay - the correct amounts in personal taxation. 'Tax is an issue of fundamental importance for development,' its report said. 'If developing countries are to escape from aid dependency, and from poverty more broadly, it is imperative that their revenue authorities are able to collect taxes effectively.' But the MPs said efforts to improve . tax collection were hampered by new Treasury rules for multinational . companies which give them an incentive to shift profits into tax havens. Recent . changes to so-called 'controlled foreign companies' rules mean that . less tax money will flow into the coffers of developing countries. One . aid agency, ActionAid, has estimated that it could cost developing . countries up to £4billion in lost tax revenues, and the committee said . the Government should consider reversing the changes 'as a matter of . urgency'. Recent . changes to so-called 'controlled foreign companies' rules mean that . less tax money will flow into the coffers of developing countries . Sir Malcolm said: 'The Government is committed to supporting economic growth in developing countries to reduce their dependency on aid. While this is clearly the right thing to do, it would be deeply unfortunate if the Government's efforts were undermined by its own tax rules.' The report said that ministers should introduce rules requiring companies to publish financial information on a country-by-country basis to discourage cross-border tax evasion. So far the Government has been reluctant to act unless other EU countries are prepared to follow suit, but the MPs said Britain should now be prepared to go it alone. Lucia Fry, ActionAid's head of policy, said: 'Tax avoidance is now a major global concern, and the UK needs to take into account the impact of its own tax regime on the world's poorest countries. 'This lost revenue could enable poor countries to put more teachers in schools and nurses in hospitals, as well as ultimately helping end aid dependency.' A spokesman for the Treasury said the controlled foreign company rules were there to protect UK tax revenues and were not designed to protect those of other countries. The changes were designed to encourage investment and drive growth in the UK. 'It is not sustainable for developing countries to protect their revenue using our tax rules, a much better way is to build their capacity and capability to collect the tax that they are due,' he said.","Department for .
