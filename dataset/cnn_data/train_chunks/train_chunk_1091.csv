"Ched Evans affair has been made even worse by giving in to the mob . Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor has issued a fresh apology for appearing to compare Ched Evans' attempt to clear his name with the campaign for justice over the Hillsborough disaster. Taylor made the comments in a radio interview after it emerged that Evans' proposed move to Oldham had collapsed amid threats to club staff and their families. His remarks provoked outrage among a number of Hillsborough families and their supporters. An initial apology on Radio Merseyside earlier on Friday prompted Dr Phil Scraton, the academic who was the primary author of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, to claim Taylor had compounded his 'crass and insensitive' comments. VIDEO Gordon Taylor's apology for connecting Hillsborough and Ched Evans . Ched Evans' move to Oldham Athletic was called off after threats were made to staff members . PFA chief executive related Evans' attempt to clear his name to the battle for justice that followed Hillsborough . It is with great sadness that today I have withdrawn from talks with Oldham Athletic. I would like to thank the club, and those who have supported me in my lawful quest to find work. I apologise to the club's supporters, sponsors and all those effected by the last 72 hours. Sadly the 'mob rule' tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if I joined them. The most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of Oldham's new stand it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair. Upon legal advice, I chose not to discuss the events in question. My silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth. I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effect that that night in Rhyl has had on many people, especially the woman concerned. Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so. Taylor has now issued another apology accepting it had been a mistake to link the two issues and issued a statement on the PFA's website. He said: 'I would like to apologise unreservedly for linking the Hillsborough case with the situation involving Ched Evans. 'The last thing I intended to do was to upset anybody connected to the Hillsborough tragedy, I can only apologise.' Taylor said he had 'long been a supporter' of the Hillsborough families, adding: 'I know the people involved and I will be very happy to ring them and let them know that. 'The point I was making was not to embarrass or upset anybody at all among the Liverpool supporters. I'm very much an admirer of them and they know that.' Evans, pictured with girlfriend Natasha Massey, hasn't secured a return to football with the Latics . Evans was linked with old club Sheffield United and Hartlepool, and won't move to League One Oldham . Scraton had reacted to Taylor's initial apology by telling The Guardian: 'In his telephone interview this morning on Radio Merseyside, Gordon Taylor apologised for any offence he may have caused to the Hillsborough families. 'He then proceeded to compound yesterday's crass, insensitive and wholly inappropriate comments by stating that, 'Ched Evans is a totally different case but he has the same belief of his innocence.'' Evans, now 26, was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman. He maintains the sex in a Rhyl hotel was consensual and protests his innocence. He was released from prison in October, after serving half of a five-year sentence. Taylor mentioned Evans' situation alongside events that followed the Hillsborough tragedy, which resulted in the deaths of 96 Liverpool supporters at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in Sheffield. After years of fighting by the families of those who died, new inquests into the deaths began last year and are continuing in Warrington. Speaking about Evans' case on Thursday, Taylor had told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'He would not be the first person or persons to have been found guilty and maintained their innocence and then been proved right. 'If we are talking about things in football, we know what happened, what was alleged to have happened at Hillsborough. And it's now unravelling and we are finding it was very different to how it was portrayed at the time - indeed by the police at the time.' Margaret Aspinall, chairman of Hillsborough Family Support Group, said Taylor's comments were offensive but he shouldn't resign. She said: 'I accept his apology and I think it's ridiculous for everybody to ask for his resignation. He phrased his wording wrong. 'There is no comparison and I did find it offensive because you cannot compare what we went through with Ched Evans. 'I don't think he meant it, I think he didn't put his brain into gear. 'He's apologised now and I think we should leave it at that.' Barry Devonside, whose 18-year-old son Christopher died at Hillsborough, told the Liverpool Echo: 'My feeling is that it was a gaffe on Gordon Taylor's part and it's not the first time Taylor, in his position at the PFA, has made a gaffe. 'He is a man who, in my opinion, seriously needs to think before he opens his mouth. 'It's an absolute disgrace that he should compare Hillsborough to Ched Evans.' Oldham Athletic Chief Executive Neil Joy, reads out a statement in relation to Ched Evans on Thursday . FA Chairman Greg Dyke says there is no basis for the governing body to intervene . It has been widely reported that Oldham Athletic will not be signing Ched Evans, which we can now confirm. The whole issue has divided opinion and the club has been put under unbearable pressure as a result. Proceeding could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence. As a consequence the deal could not go ahead. As a club we condemn all crime including rape and irrespective of any appeal procedure it was always the case that we were prepared to withstand the barrage of abuse that is evident within the country and on social media. We deplore and condemn the vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff whilst this process has been in the public domain. Finally, we would like to place our gratitude to all who have supported the club during this difficult period, including the club staff, who have acted with professionalism at all times. We understand Ched has released his own statement on his website. The club will not be making any further statement on this matter.","Ched Evans was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2012 .

"Ched Evans is currently searching for a new club after serving half his five-year sentence for rape. He would be by no means the first player to be imprisoned and make a return to the pitch. We chart some of the other convicted footballers who have continued with their careers. Ched Evans (right) and girlfriend Natasha Massey leave her parents' home in Alderley Edge on Thursday . Joey Barton . In May 2008, Barton, then playing for Newcastle United, was sentenced to six months in prison after being found guilty of common assault and affray during a violent attack in Liverpool city centre just after Christmas 2007. He served 74 days of this prison term - less than half - and walked free from Strangeways prison in Manchester on July 28. On July 1, 2008, Barton was handed a four-month sentence suspended for two years after admitting a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former Manchester City team-mate Ousmane Dabo in May 2007. The incident had ended his Sky Blues career. When Barton left jail in July 2008, he went straight back to Newcastle and returned to Premier League action the following month. He remained with the Tyneside club until 2011 before joining Queens Park Rangers, where he still plays. He spent a season on loan at French club Marseille in 2012-13. Joey Barton is released from Strangeways prison in Manchester in 2008 after spending 74 days inside . Tony Adams . In December 1990, Adams was imprisoned for four months after being caught drink-driving. He was four times over the legal limit when he crashed his Ford Sierra into a wall in Rayleigh, Essex. Adams was freed in February, having served half his sentence and returned to the Arsenal team. The defender did overcome his alcohol addiction a few years later and founded the Sporting Chance clinic to help sports men and women suffering from addiction to drink, drugs and gambling. On the pitch, Adams was highly successful, leading Arsenal to Premier League and FA Cup Doubles in 1998 and 2002. Tony Adams was imprisoned for four months in December 1990 after being caught drink-driving . Lee Hughes . Striker Hughes was playing for West Bromwich Albion when he was sentenced in August 2004 to six years in prison for causing death by dangerous driving. Hughes lost control of his Mercedes near his Warwickshire home and went on to the wrong side of the road before colliding with a Renault Scenic. One passenger in the Renault was killed and two others severely injured. Hughes was released in August 2007, three years into his sentence. He was immediately sacked by West Brom after his conviction but signed a two-year contract with Oldham Athletic after his release. Hughes tried to draw a line under the affair, saying: ‘After today I do not intend to discuss or make comment about the events which led to my imprisonment. I have made this decision, not out of protection for myself, but with regard to the privacy and respect for the families involved. I made dreadful mistakes and decisions that will live with me for the rest of my life. It also greatly affected my immediate family, including my wife and children, and I will never forgive myself for this.’ He scored 25 goals in two seasons for them before later playing for Notts County, Port Vale and, presently, Forest Green Rovers. Striker Lee Hughes pictured outside Coventry Magistrates Court in November 2003 . Luke McCormick . Goalkeeper McCormick had his contract terminated by Plymouth Argyle after a car crash in June 2008 that killed two children. McCormick was driving back from the wedding of former team-mate David Norris when his Range Rover collided with a Toyota Previa on the M6 in Staffordshire. He was charged by police with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, driving with excess alcohol in his blood and driving with no insurance and was sentenced to seven years and four months’ imprisonment in October that year. McCormick was released in June 2012 and later that year signed for Conference South team Truro City. He moved on to Oxford United in 2013 and is now back in goal for Plymouth. Plymouth Argyle goalkeeper Luke McCormick arrives at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court in June 2008 . Duncan Ferguson . Ferguson received a three-month prison sentence for his on-field headbutt on Raith Rovers defender John McStay while playing for Rangers in 1994. The Scotland international became the first footballer to be jailed for assaulting a fellow professional on the pitch. Ferguson moved to Everton after serving his time and played there until 1998, becoming a hero with the fans for his uncompromising approach. He spent a season at Newcastle before returning to Everton until his retirement in 2006. Duncan Ferguson headbutts Raith Rovers defender John McStay during a Scottish league match in 1994 . McStay (right) speaks to referee Kenny Clark (centre) after the incident as Ferguson looks on . Gary Croft . Croft made an unwanted piece of football history in January 2000 when he became the first player to wear an electronic tag during a game between Ipswich Town and Swindon Town. Croft had just been released from prison after serving just a month of a four-month contract for driving while disqualified and perverting the course of justice. Croft had to wear the tag, clearly visible around his left ankle, for three weeks and couldn’t play evening matches because of a curfew that demanded he be home by 7pm. Croft continued to play for Ipswich despite his prison term and later turned out for Cardiff City, Grimsby Town and Lincoln City. Marlon King . King has sustained a football career at a fairly high level despite a string of convictions. In May 2002, when at Gillingham, he received an 18-month prison sentence for receiving stolen goods after being caught at the wheel of a stolen BMW convertible worth £32,000. Gillingham continued to pay his salary while behind bars and after he was released on licence after five months, he returned to the Gillingham team within two days. In 2009, King was sentenced to 18 months in prison for sexual assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm after punching a 20-year-old girl in the face during a night out in Soho. Wigan Athletic cancelled his contract but he returned to football with Coventry City in September 2010 following his release. He moved on to play for Birmingham City and, briefly, for Sheffield United before being sent to prison again in May last year. King received an 18-month sentence for dangerous driving after leaving a man seriously injured following a car crash in April 2013. Marlon King, then playing for Middlesbrough, arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court in February 2009 . Jan Molby . Liverpool star Molby was sentenced to three months inside for dangerous driving in October 1988. He was briefly at Walton Prison in Liverpool before being moved to Kirkham Open Prison. Despite Molby’s concerns, Liverpool stood by him and he returned to the team in January 1989, a month or so after his release. He remained at Anfield for another eight years. Jermaine Pennant . In March 2005, while on loan at Birmingham from Arsenal, Pennant was handed a three-month prison sentence for drink-driving and driving while disqualified. Pennant, then 22, had crashed his car into a lamppost in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He was released on parole after 30 days and was ordered to wear an electronic tag at all times, including in matches for Birmingham. He remained with the club for another year before signing for Liverpool in a £6.7m deal. Jermaine Pennant (centre) is escorted to Aylesbury Magistrates' Court in March 2005 . Mickey Thomas . Thomas was playing for Wrexham towards the end of his career in 1993 when he served 18 months in jail for a counterfeit currency scam. He was passing faked £10 and £20 notes to the club’s trainees. Thomas, who also spent time at Chelsea and Manchester United during his career, later said he felt the sentence was unjust. ‘The judge made an example of me. He was enjoying it: a full house, with all the media there. If I’d been anyone else, I probably wouldn’t have gone to jail.’ Still, his time inside resulted in plenty of anecdotes for his after dinner speaking tours, one favourite being: ‘So Roy Keane’s on 50-grand a week. Mind you, I was on 50-grand a week until the police found my printing machine.’ Thomas didn’t return to Wrexham after his release and ended his career at Welsh side Porthmadog.

"Ched Evans has issued another statement after his proposed deal to join Oldham Athletic collapsed on Thursday. The convicted rapist was in talks to join the League One club, despite widespread opposition. However, the Latics pulled the plug after intolerable pressure from sponsors and fans. An Oldham board member was told his daughter would be raped if the club agreed a deal with the striker.

Evans was released from prison in October, with his potential return to football sparking widespread debate . Evans looked set to to sign a two-and-a-half year deal with Oldham before they made a last-minute U-turn. The 26-year-old has apologised to the Latics for the media storm surrounding the club, but blamed ‘mob rule tactics’ for the club’s decision to finally back down to the pressure and deny him a return to the game. He said: ‘It is with great sadness that today I have withdrawn from talks with Oldham Athletic.

"Restaurant chain Nando’s have become the latest company to end their relationship with Oldham over the impending signing of Ched Evans. Convicted rapist Evans looks set to return to football with the League One club and could sign a two-and-half-year deal as early as Thursday. Oldham owner and chairman Simon Corney said: ‘There is an 80 per cent chance of us signing him. It’s not straightforward and there are some legal issues. We believe he has served his time.’ Oldham Athletic's deal to sign Ched Evans is at an advanced stage and is set to be announced on Thursday . Evans, pictured with his fiancee on Tuesday, is set to sign a deal with the League One club until 2017 . Evans (pictured in Cheshire on Sunday) will earn a salary comparable with his Oldham Athletic team-mates . Nando's have ended their relationship with Oldham due to the impending signing of Evans . Speaking exclusively to The Jewish Chronicle, Corney added: ‘There might be a cost implication, but you have to stick to your principles. We weren’t surprised by the backlash.’ However, Nando’s - who had been involved with promotions at Oldham – tweeted: ‘RE Oldham signing: we’d have liked to continue our involvement with fan prizes at matches but feel we can no longer continue our association.’ Nando’s announcement came after Verlin Rainwater Solutions cut their ties with the club, which included sponsoring a stand at Boundary Park. Company director Craig Verlin said: ‘It is with great regret that Verlin Rainwater Solutions will no longer be associated with Oldham Athletic.

A statement from the company said: ‘This partnership has been based on mutual respect based on family and community. ZenOffice do not agree that the current path OAFC are embarking on espouses these values. Therefore it is with much regret that we confirm we will end our association with Oldham Athletic if the move goes ahead to sign Ched Evans.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nando's have been involved with promotions at Oldham Athletic .

"Oldham Atheltic have revealed the club's fans and staff received death threats as the club attempted to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. The League One side were forced to pull out of a deal to sign the former Sheffield United striker after intolerable pressure from sponsors and fans  extended to threats and 'vile abuse' on social media aimed at the club's staff.

Saunders, who was last in work as manager of Wolves, will step in and be in charge of Sunday's clash with Colchester. John Gregory has stepped down as Crawley Town manager with immediate effect . A club statement read: 'Crawley Town can confirm that team manager John Gregory is stepping down from his position with immediate effect. 'John will be undergoing a major open-heart surgery operation at the beginning of January and afterwards will need a lengthy period of recuperation. This operation needs to be done as soon as possible but is not stress-related. 'The club have appointed Dean Saunders as interim team manager. Dean will be responsible for every aspect of the playing side including coaching, player recruitment and scouting.

"Crawley striker Matt Harrold played in goal for the entire second half and won his first man-of-the-match award for the club as only a 96th-minute equaliser denied them the win over MK Dons. The 30-year-old replaced goalkeeper Brian Jensen after he dislocated his finger in the 39th minute and, with no replacement on the substitutes' bench, Harrold was told to go between the sticks. Harrold had never played in goal during a match or in training before, and admitted feeling a little awkward that his first man of the match came from stopping goals rather than scoring them. Crawley's stand-in goalkeeper Matt Harrold punches clear during the League One draw with MK Dons . Harrold earned his first man-of-the-match award by playing in goal for Crawley during the 2-2 draw . 'I've never played in goal before. Not even in training,' Harrold told BBC Surrey after the 2-2 draw. 'I got pressured into it because everyone just looked at me and said ""you're big"". 'It's a bit embarrassing because it's my first man of the match for the club. It was such a late goal to concede and we're all devastated but we would have taken a point when I went in goal. 'It was a bit like playing with 10 men because we dropped deep and they hung high balls up at me but I did enjoy it. I felt comfortable in there in the second half after having a bit of a shocker when I first came on.' The draw means Crawley remain in the League One relegation zone but Crawley Town interim boss Dean Saunders was proud of Harrold's performance in goal. 'The fourth official put the board up with five minutes extra and played 96,' he said. 'Eventually there're so many people in the box that one of the balls has dropped to them and it feels like we've lost two points. 'We've got one goalkeeper at the club which I find unbelievable really but we have one keeper at the club and I was hoping we could get through this game and next week I can address it.

"Nobody was more relieved than Ritchie Humphreys as Chesterfield staged a remarkable second-half comeback to keep alive their hopes of an FA Cup fourth round meeting with Derby. The Chesterfield midfielder presented Lyle Taylor with a goal in the 44th minute - and looked to have sent Scunthorpe towards the next round. Taylor latched on to a weak header by Humphreys to advance and drill the ball past goalkeeper Tommy Lee. Scunthorpe players look on with dejection after Jay O'Shea late equaliser earned Chesterfield a replay . Lyall Taylor fires the ball home from close range to give Scunthorpe a 2-0 lead against Chesterfield . It was a key moment in the tie because Chesterfield were threatening to hit back after going behind to a 19th minute strike from Alex Davey. Davey, whose loan from Chelsea has been extended until the end of the season, finished in style when he collected a clearance just outside the area. It was a massive setback for Chesterfield, who won their third round tie against MK Dons only four days earlier after being ordered to replay it because they used an ineligible player in the first meeting. They responded to Davey's goal by creating a string of chances for Armand Gnanduillet, Romuald Doyle and Eoin Doyle, but failed to take any of them. Taylor celebrates in front of the home faithful after doubling the Irons' advantage . And Chesterfield piled on the pressure in the second-half, with Sam Slocombe saving brilliantly from Sam Clucas in the 57th minute. They pulled a goal back in the 71st minute when Doyle stroked in a penalty after a foul on Gary Roberts. And Chesterfield got their deserved equaliser when Roberts pulled the ball back and O'Shea drilled the ball beyond Lee in the 85th minute. Scunthorpe also went close to a stoppage time goal when Madden's shot was well saved by Lee. Alex Davey looks to get hold of the ball ahead of Gary Roberts as Scunthorpe searched for another goal . Chesterfield manager Paul Cook said:'It was a fantastic comeback, but it was the least we deserved. 'We conceded goals against the run of play in the first-half and it is always hard to come back from 2-0. We were very disappointed with their second goal because that is always important in any games. 'But we know our lads are fit and it's a credit to everyone at the club that we came back so well. 'Scunthorpe are a very good side and we showed how both of us want to play Derby. Now whoever goes through will deserve to go through.' Hakeeb Adelakun is tacked by Sam Clucas during the first half of the cup encounter . Chesterfield boss Mark Robins said:'It was certainly an entertaining tie. Chesterfield are a good sde with a depth of squad that is better than ours. We have to put some square pegs in round holes and it makes a difference. 'The second goal gave us a good cushion, but we knew they would put us under pressure. We knew it was coming and we talked about it and tried to organise. 'It's up to the players to cut out the danger and we did it until later in the game when we looked a little bit tired and they made changes that made a difference.'","Scunthorpe and Chesterfield face a replay after 2-2 draw at Glanford Park .

"It has been a long 20 minutes but, finally, Phil Jagielka is smiling. Everton’s captain has been dealing with thorny issues that have blighted his side’s campaign when the topic of squad discontent arises. Such is the way of life on Merseyside that when one of the city’s teams fares badly, stories of in-fighting, a kerfuffle on the training ground or a manager and player at loggerheads spread like wild fire. Inevitably, as Everton have slithered down the table, such tales have emerged from Finch Farm . ‘You hear some weird stuff,’ said Jagielka, rubbing his head in bemusement. ‘I think the best one (recently) was that Bainesy (Leighton Baines) had a fight with someone. Now I don’t know if you know Bainesy, or if you’ve seen him, but he’s a lover not a fighter! Phil Jagielka is confident Roberto Martinez's side have the players to push further up the league . Jagielka insists morale in Everton's dressing room remains high despite a topsy-turvy start to the season . ‘To be fair, it has been something for us to talk about and it makes us chuckle. I don’t know where half of the stuff comes from but that is the way it goes. The only good thing about those stories is that it gives us a little bit of a laugh at the training ground. ‘We appreciate the people that make up the really funny stuff it keeps us going on a day to day basis People are always going to talk, pundits can have their own opinions and papers are going to be written but there is not much we can do to stop that.’ One thing Jagielka and Co. can stop, though, is the downturn in fortunes they have experienced. Everton were a breath of fresh air last year but this campaign has been one of inconsistency and disappointment. Jagielka has been through a lot during almost eight years at Goodison Park, experiencing a lot of good times under David Moyes and Martinez, but he has not had to stand in front of the dressing room and deliver a talk to his colleagues about what they might lose. Given the players Martinez has available, it is difficult to envisage a point where Jagielka will be talking about relegation fights but the miserable performance at Hull on New Year’s Day was the moment he realised Everton could no longer explain their performances as a blip. Jagielka has rubbished claims suggesting Leighton Baines (right) was involved in a bust-up . Everton are struggling despite Martinez being able to call on the likes Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku . ‘I don’t sit there at home hoping I have to make rallying cries,’ said Jagielka, who took over the role of club captain after Phil Neville retired in 2013. ‘But I do go round and speak to players individually or in little groups. That’s just how I am as a character. ‘We have not got to panic stations and hopefully it won’t get to that stage. But we have lost four league games on the run and we have a tough one ahead. We need to turn things round as soon as possible because four points above the relegation one isn’t where we want to be.’ When you look at the team Martinez will put out against the champions, you cannot help but feel they are in a false position. Ross Barkley, Kevin Mirallas and Romelu Lukaku certainly have the ability to threaten City but they have not been able to put it together at Goodison. It has left the famous old stadium muted and apprehensive but there were signs during the 1-1 FA Cup draw with West Ham on Tuesday that, perhaps, it is flickering into life once again. If it does, the energy from Everton’s crowd and team could give City an uncomfortable afternoon. Lukaku scored in the last minute against West Ham to earn a third-round FA Cup replay . ‘When results are going well everything takes care of itself,’ said the England international. ‘When it’s not people are down, everyone is a bit more quiet. At games fans are a bit more on edge, expecting us to turn it round, and you can feel the anxiety not only from fans but players as well. ‘We are desperate to give them something to shout about. We are fully aware that we’ve not been performing well enough. You can’t expect to go into a game when fans haven’t seen you win for a month and expect them to chant for 90 minutes. That just never happens.’ They will if they beat City. So why is Jagielka so sure Everton can upset the odds? ‘I’ve got a hell of a lot of confidence that within the squad,’ he replies. ‘We have people that will dig in but we need to start showing that and get results. We need to back up that theory.’","Everton captain Phil Jagielka is confident his side will address poor form .

"West Ham United supporters reacted furiously after being asked to pay a £75 deposit on their season tickets for next year. The Hammers, who will move into the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 campaign, want supporters to pay the fee by April 17. That has prompted annoyance from a number of fans online - although the payment will be deducted from the ticket price, which is due on May 31 in line with previous years. West Ham United fans reacted furiously after being asked to pay a £75 deposit on next year's season tickets . Vice-Chairman Karren Brady pointed out the club had spent big on the playing squad recently . Andy Carroll celebrates scoring at Upton Park - a ground West Ham are set to leave in 2016 . The Olympic Stadium in Stratford will house the Hammers from the start of the 2016-17 season . Ladies' player Stacey Little took to Twitter to complain about the ticketing situation . West Ham Ladies midfielder Stacey Little was among those who took to Twitter to complain. 'I may play for West Ham but I'm also a West Ham fan who PAYS MY HARD EARNED MONEY like everyone else for my season ticket & I will have an opinion on this,' she wrote. 'Instead you have to pay a £75 NON REFUNDABLE deposit!!! Or pay it in full. Oh & the deadline date has also been brought forward again. That's what you get for being a loyal fan!!!' Demand is high for season tickets, given it will be their last term at Upton Park. They have increased by five per cent having been previously frozen since the club's promotion to the Premier League. One fan said: 'So West Ham keep going on about how they are making football affordable. Yet they are putting season ticket prices up by 5%. They have a lot more demand for the last season at the Boleyn so they decide to make as much money from it as possible.' But vice-chairman Karren Brady pointed towards the significant investment into Sam Allardyce's squad - particularly last summer. 'Since 2010, our commitment to the fans has been to restore the Club's long-term financial health, while at the same time investing substantially in improving the playing squad,' she said. 'I may play for West Ham but I'm also a West Ham fan who PAYS MY HARD EARNED MONEY like everyone else for my season ticket & I will have an opinion on this,' she wrote. 'Instead you have to pay a £75 NON REFUNDABLE deposit!!! Or pay it in full. Oh & the deadline date has also been brought forward again. That's what you get for being a loyal fan!!!' 'The nine signings we made last summer have all made a big impact and we are planning significant further investment in the playing staff this summer. 'We are also improving the financial situation at the Club and are on course to meet our target of being clear of external debt by the time we move to our stunning new home on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. 'After last year's price freeze across the board, I am pleased we have been able to once again freeze prices for junior supporters. For everyone else we have capped the increase to all tickets at five per cent, the equivalent of just £1.58 per game for price-band 4 or £2.37 per game for price-band 1. 'Over the past five years, the increase in the price of a renewed Season Ticket at the Boleyn Ground has tracked at approximately 40 per cent below the rate of inflation (RPI), meaning a Season Ticket still represents fantastic value for money.' The price of a West Ham season ticket has gone up by five per cent for next season . Joint-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold added: 'It is clear that our final year at the Boleyn Ground and our first year at the new Stadium will be two seasons that no West Ham fan will want to miss. It is in response to that demand - and the pressures of managing it - that we are beginning next season's renewals and sales process earlier than normal. 'As long-standing advocates of making football more affordable, we are pleased to confirm that we will be freezing Under-10s and Under-16s Season Ticket prices for a second consecutive year. 'With prices starting at just £110 for Under-10s and £235 for Under-16s, we are hoping as many young Hammers as possible can be part of what is sure to be an exciting and emotional 19 games.' Stacey Little was right to speak out. It was from the heart, with a genuine concern as a fan - not as captain of the Ladies team. And as a season ticket holder myself, I have to say I too was very disappointed by the news, at first. Requesting a £75 early deposit seems to be quite cheeky. It feels unfair to loyal supporters, many of whom have been attending home games for 10, 20, 30 years. The message appeared to be 'Pay up or lose your seat'. Of course, that isn't the case at all and there is a perfect logic to all of this. Demand for tickets has reached unprecedented levels at West Ham. Every Premier League game this season has been a sell-out so far and there are several-thousand supporters signed-up to a waiting list, hoping to get their hands on any leftover seats for next season's farewell to the Boleyn Ground. This is a more of a measure to ensure a smooth transition for the eventual move to Stratford in 2016. And providing the team continue to play well, there'll be no further complaints from yours truly!","West Ham United supporters need to pay deposit by April 17 .

"Washington at New York, 5pm . Oklahoma City at San Antonio, 7.30pm . Cleveland at Miami, 10pm . LA Lakers at Chicago, 1am . Golden State at LA Clippers, 3.30am . (Times GMT) While the rest of the sporting world will be tucking into turkeys and families will be unwrapping gifts, Christmas Day will be just another day at work for the best basketball players in the world. The NBA will once again serve up an action-packed festive feast on Christmas Day with five marquee match-ups set to take place in one of the highlights of the basketball calendar. There's plenty to look forward to as well with an early start at Madison Square Garden, LeBron James returning to his former team Miami and a rematch of the Western Conference Finals between San Antonio and Oklahoma City. But all that is just the early part of the day. Late on Christmas night, Kobe Bryant will lead his Los Angeles Lakers into Chicago and there is a tasty treat to end the day when the Golden State Warriors visit the Los Angeles Clippers. Here is our preview of Thursday's basketball feast, which begins at 5pm UK time. Watch the NBA Christmas Day games live on BT Sport or via NBA LEAGUE PASS at www.nba.tv . The NBA will be in full swing on Christmas Day with five games on back-to-back throughout the day . LEBRON RETURNS TO MIAMI . The best player in the world returns to south Florida and to the team he led to back-to-back NBA titles. James departed Miami in the summer to return home to Ohio and the Cleveland Cavaliers, and his former fans on South Beach will get their first chance to see him in action since he left. On the other side will be Luol Deng, the British star who made a name for himself in his decade with the Chicago Bulls and is now looking to lead the new-look Heat in life after LeBron. LeBron James returns to Miami on Christmas Day when his Cleveland Cavaliers take on the Heat . James will return to the place where he won back-to-back NBA titles with the Miami Heat . 'At first it was a strange feeling playing on Christmas Day but now I’ve gotten used to it. I really like how the NBA has made it a real family festive day where people come out to arena’s all over the US to support the league. It’s something I really enjoy being a part of. 'I haven’t spent Christmas Day in London for so long, I’ve got used to all my family being with me in the US. I remember how brilliant London looks at this time of year. It always has so many Christmas decorations and lights which was really cool to see!' The Cavaliers travel to Florida hot on the heels of the Chicago Bulls in the Central Division and seeded fifth as things stand in the Eastern Conference. After some teething problems early on while trying to bed in new signings James and Kevin Love with point guard Kyrie Irving, Cleveland are beginning to emerge as a force in the East and will be one of the leading contenders come play-off time. In Miami, the Heat have made a steady start to the season and currently occupy a low play-off position but they are below 500 this season and will want to improve on that. Can Deng team up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to stop the Cavs on Christmas? Britain's Luol Deng will be in action for a new look Miami Heat team on Christmas Day . Christmas Day games have been a tradition in the NBA dating all the way back to the 1940s in the league's early years. The games provide some marquee match-ups featuring the best players and teams in the league. It is also the first time in the season that NBA games are screened on free-to-air national television in the United States. WEST COAST SHOWDOWN . The Golden State Warriors have been the best team in the league in the first part of this season, going on a 16-game winning streak that saw them surge to the top of the Western Conference standings. Steph Curry and Co have lit up the league and look like the team to beat in a Western Conference that is always extremely competitive. But it will be no Christmas walkover for the Warriors and they had better come out to play at the Staples Center when they face the Los Angeles Clippers. The Clippers are leading the chase of the Warriors in the Pacific Division and the likes of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin will be hoping to close in on their rivals with a big win on Thursday night.

This season has been far from easy for the San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder, and the Western Conference rivals will be looking to get one over each other on Thursday. The Spurs beat the Thunder in a thrilling Western Conference Finals last year, avenging their defeat at the same stage of the play-offs in 2012. The Thunder are on the road to recovery having been without their two superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook for a large part of the last few months through injury, but they still have a long way to go to make the play-offs. San Antonio, meanwhile, have been without the likes of Tiago Splitter and Patty Mills while Tony Parker, Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard have also had their problems with injury and the need for a rest. Both teams are battered and bruised, but that will only serve to make Thursday's game even more important and exciting. Reigning NBA champions San Antonio Spurs will take on Oklahoma City Thunder on Christmas Day . Oklahoma City have missed their two superstars Kevin Durant (left) and Russell Westbrook (right) HIGH-FLYING BULLS TACKLE KOBE'S LAKERS . Kobe Bryant will head to Chicago for the first time since passing Bulls legend Michael Jordan into third place on the all-time scoring list. Bryant is often likened to Jordan, who is widely regarded as the greatest player to ever play the game, and he will be looking to make a statement against the team with whom MJ enjoyed so much success. The Bulls find themselves well placed in the Eastern Conference with a top-four seeding, and Derrick Rose finally looks to be over the injury problems that have plagued him over the last two seasons and also the start of this campaign. Given the strength of the Western Conference, the Lakers are already at the stage where they will need a miracle to reach the play-offs. But Kobe will be motivated to lead his side to a win with the eyes of a nation watching after they've tucked into their turkeys.

WIZARDS LOOK TO CAST A SPELL AT THE GARDEN . The day's action begins at Madison Square Garden when the Washington Wizards make the short trip north to take on the New York Knicks. The Big Apple is far from a happy place at the moment with the team in all sorts of trouble. Only the Philadelphia 76ers have been worse than the Knicks this season, leading to criticism of new coach Derek Fisher. But the Knicks, who head to London to take on the Milwaukee Bucks in January, would like nothing more than a win to lift the gloom at the Garden. It will be no easy feat, though, against a Washington team that is hot on the heels of Toronto and Atlanta at the top of the Eastern Conference standings.

"With his black notebook in hand, Alan Pardew started the task of reshaping Crystal Palace during their 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Saturday. This has been his first full week working with his new charges since replacing Neil Warnock in charge. So what were the first noticeable signs of change from the Warnock regime? Alan Pardew celebrates with a smile after Crystal Palace beat Tottenham 2-1 on Saturday . Possession . Following the FA Cup win over Dover last week, Pardew promised his team will take risks with the ball. They certainly lived up to that billing yesterday, keeping the ball on the deck; looking to play their way out of their defensive third rather than clearing their lines as was often the case under Warnock. One passage of play in the 14th minute in particular showed clear signs of Pardew's influence. The long-ball remains an option, but the instructions to keep the ball were fully apparent. The Crystal Palace boss reacts during the second half against Tottenham on Saturday evening . Pardew celebrates with his backroom staff during Crystal Palace's victory over Tottenham . Barry Bannan . The diminutive Scot was a peripheral figure under Warnock and Tony Pulis. But the playmaker has started both of Pardew's games at Palace and looks like he's being reintegrated into the club's first-team plans. That, of course, could change when Mile Jedinak returns from international duty, but for now the former Aston Villa man is back in the game. He was substituted, having been booked in the first-half, and Spurs took the lead just four minutes later. Pardew celebrating after Dwight Gayle scored the penalty to level the game at 1-1 . A Crystal Palace fan with a 'Pardew here to the rescue' sign at Selhurst Park on Saturday . Versatility in attacking . Warnock's Palace was based on getting the ball wide to the likes of Yannick Bolasie, Jason Puncheon or Wilfried Zaha, relying on their pace to get behind opposition. There was still an element of that under Pardew, but without Bolasie, who is on Africa Cup of Nations duty, Palace explored alternative avenues of attack. There was crisper passing in front of the Tottenham back-four, the way they carved open the Spurs back-line for Glenn Murray's excellent chance in the 35th minute was testament to that. It doesn't look as if Palace will be one trick ponies under Pardew.

"Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher has questioned whether Liverpool did enough to keep Steven Gerrard at Anfield. Steven Gerrard is on the verge of agreeing a £3.9million deal to join LA Galaxy on an 18-month contract, according to reports from the US. The Liverpool captain announced he would be leaving the club after 26 years at Anfield and has confirmed he will move to the MLS at the end of the season - with David Beckham's former club the clear favourites to sign him. Negotiations are understood to be taking place that would see the former England captain join the defending MLS champions in July. The MLS Board of Governors are believed to have approved the deal because the league will pick up a $750,000 supplement from the Galaxy. Steven Gerrard (centre) is reportedly close to signing an 18-month contract with LA Galaxy . The Liverpool spoke to LFCTV in an exclusive interview released on Saturday afternoon . Gerrard is expected to take retired Landon Donovan's place as one of three Designated Players . The MLS operates under a salary cap structure, whereby each club has three Designated Player places that can be used to sign high priced stars. The Galaxy already have US defender Omar Gonzalez and former Liverpool striker Robbie Keane (who shares the same agent as Gerrard) - but the third place has been freed up by Landon Donovan's retirement following victory in the 2014 MLS Cup. An MLS representative said the league is 'not able to provide additional insight into a potential player agreement.' In an emotional interview, Gerrard admitted that the prospect of reduced playing time next term was a major factor in making what he described as 'the toughest decision of his life'. ‘I think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team,’ said Gerrard during an exclusive interview with LFCTV on Saturday. Gerrard stretches during a training session ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup clash with Wimbledon . Gerrard has confirmed that the prospect of less playing time next season influenced his decision to leave . Gerrard could join up with former Reds striker Robbie Keane who helped the Galaxy win the 2014 MLS Cup . ‘I’m bright enough to realise it is the right thing for everyone, but when you’ve been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time, it was a very difficult conversation to have. ‘I accept it and I’ll continue to give everything I’ve got, whether I’m starting, coming off the bench or whatever, but that was the key conversation that swung me to deciding to come away for a short while. ‘The reality is I am going to be 35 in the summer. I’ve been here for a long time, I’ve been coming to this training ground since I was eight. I always knew it was going to end one day and that it was going to be an emotional decision. That decision is here.’","Steven Gerrard announced he is leaving Liverpool at end of the season .

"Wilfried Bony has revealed that negotiations over his prospective move to Manchester City are ongoing while his agent expects the deal to be completed within 'a few days'.

Although Bony claimed 'I am waiting just like you' to find out when the deal will be completed, the player's agent Francis Kacou confirmed City are the only club in the frame and that he expects the transfer to be completed soon. 'Talks are going on and we are waiting but we hope soon things will happen, said Lacina. 'It looks like it is going to happen.

"Steffon Armitage will not be considered for selection by England for the upcoming Six Nations but his form at No 8 means World Cup dream is NOT over. Stuart Lancaster names his squad for the Six Nations later this month and will again ignore overseas-based players, most notably Armitage, under RFU guidelines. The England head coach, however, is expected to exercise the 'exceptional circumstances' clause by selecting the Toulon back row in his pre-World Cup training squad in May. Steffon Armitage has not been selected by England since he moved to France in 2011 . Armitage is widely considered one of the best players in Europe, if not the world, and Lancaster has been impressed by his form at No 8 over the last year. It has been a problem position for England since Lancaster took charge in 2012 and he is keen to explore his options. Gloucester No 8 Ben Morgan won England's man of the series in the autumn but there are concerns over Billy Vunipola's fitness and big-match temperament. With few other alternatives and given his form for Toulon, it is becoming harder to ignore Armitage. The former London Irish back row, 29, won European player of the year last season . Lancaster has been reluctant to bow to calls for the 29-year-old to be selected as he has kept faith in captain Chris Robshaw and Northampton's Tom Wood on the flanks and Morgan and Vunipola at No 8. But with the World Cup just eight months away and following a disappointing autumn series he wants his best players available for assessment in May. The Six Nations is likely to come too soon for Bath rugby league convert Sam Burgess but he too is likely to be picked for the end-of-season training camp, which will include over 40 players. Bath's Sam Burgess (centre) is also set to be selected by Stuart Lancaster for May's training camp . Armitage saw a move to Bath fall through in October, seemingly scuppering his hopes of adding to his five England caps before or during the World Cup. But should he impress Lancaster in May then he may well be pulling on the Red Rose again come the World Cup kick-off on September 18.","Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage has not played for England since 2009 .

"Swansea manager Garry Monk hopes striker Bafetimbi Gomis will be competition for Wilfried Bony and not a replacement. The France international scored his first goals for two months with two in the 6-2 FA Cup victory over League Two side Tranmere on Saturday. Gomis will become the Swans' first-choice striker with Bony missing for at least a month due to Ivory Coast duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, but Monk remains hopeful the pair can work together on the top scorer's return. Swansea manager Garry Monk wants to keep Manchester City target Wilfried Bony at the club . Bony has scored nine goals in 22 games for the Premier League outfit so far this season . Asked whether he was expecting phone calls from clubs enquiring about prized asset Bony, Monk said: 'I hope not. I can't afford to lose players. 'We haven't got a big squad as it is but what we do have is quality. I am looking to add, I'm not looking to lose any players.' Gomis scored twice late on at Prenton Park but by then the match was already won after Nathan Dyer, Tom Carroll and Mo Barrow put the visitors 3-0 ahead inside 58 minutes. Tranmere showed they were not willing to capitulate, with Max Power and Cole Stockton scoring either side of Gomis' first, but substitute Wayne Routledge and Gomis gave the scoreline a slightly flattering appearance. On Gomis, Monk added: 'Strikers thrive on goals, that's what they are here for. Bafetimbi Gomis will fill the void left by Bony while he is competing at the Africa Cup of Nations . 'Bafe is a quality striker, I have said that all along, and you saw the type of performance he put in and he can take that into this period ahead now. 'He has had limited game-time. He has shown glimpses of what he can do already but the two goals and the performance he put in will do him the world of good. 'They are top goals he scored and it wasn't just his goals, it was his performance and the way he took the goals, his composure.' Tranmere boss Micky Adams admits the FA Cup exit allows his team to concentrate on the priority of safeguarding their Football League status as they currently sit in the bottom two of League Two. 'I am trying to improve the squad and that is going to be the focus now,' Adams said. 'We were never going to win the cup and our league campaign is important to us now and we have to pick up the points. 'We can't worry about other teams, we have to worry about ourselves and if we show the same desire and application we showed against Swansea we will be fine. 'Since I've been here every time we have conceded a goal or lost a game we have always bounced back and I hope that will be the case at Morecambe next week.' Micky Adams believes his side's defeat by Swansea could be a blessing in disguise .","Wilfried Bony has been linked with a £25m move to Manchester City .

"Manchester City are set to sign Wilfried Bony after opening talks with Swansea over a £30million deal for the Ivory Coast striker. Both clubs confirmed on Tuesday that negotiations are under way, although a transfer fee and personal terms have yet to be agreed. Swansea are demanding £25m up front plus £5m in add-ons, and Bony wants to double his earnings to £120,000 a week. Although the 26-year-old is at a training camp in Abu Dhabi preparing for the Africa Cup of Nations, his representatives were discussing terms with the Premier League champions on Tuesday night. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony is closing in on a January move to champions Manchester City . The Ivory Coast international has scored more Premier League goals (20) than any other player in 2014 . Wilfried Bony - 20 . Sergio Aguero - 16 . Edin Dzeko - 14 . Yaya Toure - 14 . Daniel Sturridge - 13 . Wayne Rooney - 13 . City must ensure that any deal falls in line with the financial limitations imposed on them by UEFA for breaching financial fair play rules. Manuel Pellegrini would also have to cut one foreign player from his Champions League squad if he wants to register Bony for next month’s tie with Barcelona. But Pellegrini realised he needs a fourth senior striker after seeing Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic all sidelined by injury last month. Speaking during a press conference on New Year's Eve, the City manager said: 'I think that is just one of the 20 or 30 names I have read from the beginning of the season until today that we are [supposedly] interested in. Bony holds off Jordan Henderson (left) during a Premier League match against Liverpool in December . Injuries to players including Sergio Aguero (left), Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic have left City short up front . 2006-2008: Issia Wazi . 2007-2008: Sparta Prague B (loan) 2008-2011: Sparta Prague (59 apps, 22 gls) 2011-2013: Vitesse (65, 46) 2013-NOW: Swansea City (54, 25) 2010-NOW: Ivory Coast (32, 11) 'I don't think we are going to be too busy in this window. We have restrictions about the amount of money and about the number of players we can put in the Champions League, so I don't think it will be a special transfer window for our team.' The potential move for Bony, who is also a target for Real Madrid, would be against Swansea manager Garry Monk's wishes after he stated on Monday that he hoped no players would leave the Liberty Stadium in January. Asked whether he was expecting phone calls from clubs enquiring about Bony, Monk said: 'I hope not. I can't afford to lose players. 'We haven't got a big squad as it is but what we do have is quality. I am looking to add, I'm not looking to lose any players.' Bony is expected to be absent for several weeks as he takes part in the Africa Cup of Nations during January . City's interest is unsurprising since Bony scored more Premier League goals than any other player during the 2014 calendar year - racking up 20 strikes to place him above City's leading scorer Sergio Aguero (16), while Yaya Toure and Edin Dzeko netted 14 apiece. However, speaking to Sportsmail in January after netting his 18th goal in a 1-1 draw with Crystal palace, Bony said: 'I really don't care about statistics.' The 26-year-old insists he is more concerned with achieving  personal ambitions while dismissing the perception that he is an easy-going guy. 'I have to be in control,' he said. 'I must. It is very important. 'I am a hard person - I am not an easy guy. I want always to be in control, everything I do in football and outside. At the end of the season I want to do this, after next season I want to do that. 'Goals, objectives. I know who can help me, who can't help me. The people who can help, from the beginning I talk to them: ""I want that and that - you have to help me. And if you help me, I help you."" Swansea manager Garry Monk (right) had previously said he hoped Bony would not be leaving in January . 'I like to use my power. Wherever we go, in the disco or anywhere, I am always talking about this every day. 'I always tell my friends - Roland Lamah, (Wayne) Routledge, Jonathan de Guzman - if you have time to put in a cross do it because you know I am good with my head. You don't have to be in the box, give me the ball. 'If I head the ball one time it can be a goal. I try to be there in the right place. If I am not there, it is my mistake. 'Didier Drogba texts me to say: ""Don't let anyone destroy your objectives."" My objective is 20 goals with Swansea this season, then the World Cup and in the future I want to play the Champions League. No one will destroy my objectives.'","Manchester City have confirmed  talks have started over a January transfer .

"Swansea manager Garry Monk has urged striker Bafetimbi Gomis to build on his two-goal performance in the FA Cup against League Two side Tranmere. The France international struck late on in the 6-2 third-round victory, but his overall display has given his manager encouragement for the future, especially with Wilfried Bony away at the African Nations Cup with Ivory Coast. 'Gomis probably hasn't had the amount of minutes he would have liked; he's still played of course but in terms of why I brought him to the club you could see it there today,' said Monk.

Gomis celebrating with team-mates Marvin Emnes (left) and Wayne Routledge (centre) 'Hopefully he takes it into this next period now, he will be the first choice, and he is ready to go and hopefully he produces performances like that.' Nathan Dyer, on-loan Tottenham midfielder Tom Carroll and Gambian youngster Mo Barrow put the Swans into a comfortable lead just after half-time, before Max Power fortuitously benefited from charging down goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel's clearance. However, Gomis and substitute Wayne Routledge struck - either side of Cole Stockton's header - to ensure there was no late drama. 'We were very comfortable and I thought we controlled the whole game,' added Monk. 'We managed to get some good goals and played some good football at a place where it can always be difficult. 'They got a couple of goals which could have made it tricky but we responded really well, but I think we controlled it from start to finish.' Swansea boss Garry Monk has urged Gomis to keep on scoring after his goals against Tranmere . Swansea will be without Wilfried Bony (right) who is at the African Nations Cup with the Ivory Coast . Rovers boss Micky Adams has greater concerns than the FA Cup with his side second-bottom of League Two and admitted the gulf in class was too much to bridge without some luck, which they did not get. 'I think there are key moments in the game and my players are saying there is a definite handball for the first goal,' he said. 'If we come in at half-time at 0-0 it is a different game but, having said that, I thought Swansea's application and attitude was spot on - we were hoping to catch them on an off-day. 'When we are chasing the game the scoreline flatters them somewhat but that is the difference, that is what you pay all your money for goalscorers and they have had them today and they showed their quality.'","Bafetimbi Gomis scored twice in 6-2 FA Cup victory over Tranmere .

"Swansea City proved they are not a one-man team by rattling in six goals without star man Wilfried Bony who is away on African Cup of Nations duty and the subject of reported £25million interest from Manchester City. French striker Bafetimbi Gomis scored twice as the Premier League side emphatically swept aside the challenge of League Two Tranmere – 81 places below them in the football pyramid. An entertaining match yielded five goals in the last 20 minutes alone. Swansea, Capital One Cup winners in 2013, made nine changes from their previous Premier League game against QPR but bombarded Tranmere's goal before stand-in skipper Nathan Dyer broke the deadlock from 12 yards though home fans claimed he'd handled the ball before slamming a shot past Owain Fon Williams. Swansea's stand-in captain Nathan Dyer was on the score sheet to put his side ahead against Tranmere at Prenton Park .

Referee: Paul Tierney . Attendance: 10,007 . England under-21 international Tom Carroll, on loan from Spurs, extended the lead early in the second half with his first goal for the club and then Mo Barrow made it 3-0 from Gomis' cross early in the second half. After that it was party time with both defences going AWOL and Swans goallkeeper Gerhard Tremmel suffering a nightmare. His clearance rebounded against Max Power to allow Tranmere to pull it back to 3-1 but Gomis, a Crystal Palace target, made it 4-1 after 77 minutes. The tit-for-tat continued with Cole Stockton making it 4-2 following a Tranmere corner before substitute Wayne Routledge, allowed to play after his red card at QPR had been rescinded, fired in Gomis' pass. Gomis then scored with the final touch of the game though it was nice to see the 10,007 inside Prenton Park also applauded Tranmere off for their efforts. 'We controlled the game from start to finish, played good football and scored good goals,' said Swansea manager Garry Monk. 'Strikers thrive on goals and Gomis is a quality striker.'

"Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis has been backed to fill the void left by Wilfried Bony's departure to the African Nations Cup. Gomis has been very much in top goalscorer Bony's shadow since his summer move from Lyon, starting just four Barclays Premier League games and scoring only once - the decider in a 2-1 home victory over Arsenal in November. But Gomis, who has been linked with a move to Crystal Palace in the January transfer window, will start his second game in the space of 48 hours in Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie at Tranmere and Swansea boss Garry Monk expects the 29-year-old Frenchman to seize his chance. Bafetimbi Gomis has been been backed to be lead the line for Swansea while Wilfried Bony is away with the Ivory Coast . 'Bafe has been waiting for his chance to stake his claim,' Monk said. 'It's been difficult but unfortunately for him Bony has been in good form in the first half of the season. 'I've tried to give him game-time but Bony's been scoring goals. 'I'm sure it's been in Bafe's mind that this chance has been coming up and I think you will see a real, real player in this period.' Gomis arrived in Swansea on a free transfer but with a big reputation having scored over 100 goals in French football for St Etienne and Lyon and winning 12 caps for France. But he has been unable to dislodge Bony as Swansea's primary striker with the Ivorian having finished 2014 as the Premier League's top scorer and started 2015 with the last-gasp equaliser in the 1-1 draw at QPR being his ninth of the campaign. Gomis has played second fiddle to Bony this season since his move from Lyon . Bony has been linked with a potential £30million move to either Chelsea or Manchester City in January but Monk insists Gomis will keep the shirt if he performs well while his striking rival is away on international duty. 'I've said it's Bafe's shirt to lose no matter what happens,' Monk said. 'If Bafe's in good form when Bony comes back then he will keep the shirt. 'It's a good period for him to really stamp his authority on the team and I've proved it already this season that I'm consistent with players. 'The players that have come in and put on good performances have stayed in the team and warranted the shirt.' Wilfried Bony has been in fine form for Swansea this season but is heading off to the Africa Cup of Nations . Swansea have hardly time to pause for breath during a demanding festive schedule which has already taken them to Hull, Liverpool and QPR over the past fortnight as well as having a Boxing Day visit from Aston Villa. So Monk will utilise his squad at Tranmere, who are 22nd in League Two and managed by former Swansea boss Micky Adams, with several fringe players set to receive an opportunity in the absence of Bony, the suspended Jonjo Shelvey and injured winger Jefferson Montero. Midfielder Ki Sung-yueng is also away on international duty with South Korea at the Asian Cup in Australia and skipper Ashley Williams could be among those rested, but Monk insists Swansea will not be taking their lowly opponents for granted. Swansea City manager Garry Monk has backed Gomis to be a success at the south Wales club . 'We won't allow any complacency and that message will come from me through to the players,' Monk said. 'I've played at Tranmere and it's a tight, bobbly pitch and difficult conditions in which to play football. 'They'll be looking forward to playing against a Premier League side and they'll be up for it. 'But I take it very seriously and we'll have to use our experience because we've got players in the squad who have played in these types of games. 'We will have to make changes because we've had so many games, but hopefully we can use that experience to get us through to the next round.'","Bafetimbi Gomis has been backed to fill Wilfried Bony's boots .

"Swansea winger Wayne Routledge has successfully appealed against the red card he was shown against QPR on New Year’s Day and will face no further punishment. Routledge was sent off for his reaction to a strong tackle from Karl Henry in the 86th minute of the 1-1 draw, with Henry booked for the challenge. The dismissal had left Routledge facing a three-match ban but that has been lifted after his appeal was upheld. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sportsmail's Big Match Stats for QPR vs Swansea . Swansea winger Wayne Routledge looks shocked as he is sent off by referee Anthony Taylor . A Football Association statement said: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing on Friday 2 January 2015, Swansea City’s Wayne Routledge has had his claim for wrongful dismissal upheld. 'Routledge was dismissed during his side’s 1-1 draw against Queens Park Rangers on New Year’s Day for violent conduct. 'The three-match suspension has therefore been withdrawn with immediate effect.' Routledge reacts after Karl Henry (floor) had dived in recklessly to challenge on him . Routledge’s red card was one of a number of decisions from referee Anthony Taylor which upset Swansea - as QPR goalkeeper Rob Green should have been sent off for handling outside his area early in the match. Swans boss Garry Monk described Henry’s challenge on Routledge as a 'leg-breaker' and said the officials were mistaken in believing Routledge had kicked out in response. 'It’s a leg breaker,' Monk said. 'I think everyone knew in the stadium apart from the official and then the double whammy of our player getting sent off for apparently kicking out. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony consoles Routledge after he is sent off by Taylor . 'He doesn’t kick out at all. I just hope justice is done not just for us but for football in itself. 'I’m losing a bit of faith. It’s hard for us to keep faith when we continually have decisions like this, big moments within games. 'That sounds like me moaning, I’m not at all. I’m just telling you the facts. Swansea manager Garry Monk (second left) was furious with the decision to show the red card . 'I hope the red card gets rescinded because that will 100 per cent be the right thing to happen. 'We’ll be appealing for sure. My player goes from nearly having his leg broken to getting sent off, I don’t see how that can happen.' Despite the red card, Swansea mustered a stoppage-time leveller through Wilfried Bony, cancelling out Leroy Fer’s strike for the hosts.","Wayne Routledge given red card for reacting to Karl Henry challenge .

"Jose Mourinho has heaped praise on Cesar Azpilicueta, claiming that the full-back possesses all the attributes required in a winning team. Speaking ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie against Galatasaray on Wednesday Mourinho said that winning the Champions League was the pinnacle for every player and manager in Europe. But the 51-year-old also added that the Blues' opponents would be tricky customers to deal with, especially in the cauldron of the Turk Telekom Arena. Scroll down for video . The Happy One? Jose Mourinho's second coming at Chelsea has seen him portray a more relaxed persona . Mourinho was speaking during an interview to promote Adidas Gamedayplus . On the rise: Mourinho heaped praise onto Cesar Azpilicueta following a string of outstanding displays . Old boy: Samuel Eto'o was reportedly furious with manager Mourinho over claims about how old he is . 'Champions League is the competition I think everybody wants to win in football,' said Mourinho, speaking to sponsors adidas. 'The competition where normally every big club is, so obviously it's the competition that every club wants and every player, every coach dreams to win. 'Azpilicueta is the kind of player I like a lot. I think a team with 11 Azpilicueta's probably could win the competition because football is not just about the pure talent. 'Football is also about character and personality and Azpilicueta has all those traces of a winning personality. 'Last . season I played against Galatasaray so I know the team, the atmosphere, . how difficult it is to play against them, especially in Turkey but not . just in Turkey. 'They . are a very experienced team, top players, big atmosphere at home, . people that know how to compete and people that know how to create . difficulties. 'For sure by playing the first game at Istanbul they're . going to give us a difficult tie.'

Solid: Terry's defensive displays have raised the question of whether England will miss him in the World Cup . Up for the task: Chelsea players are put through their paces ahead of Wednesday's match against Galatasaray . Out in the cold: Ashley Cole has spent a large part of the season having to warm himself on the bench . Earlier this season Azpilicueta went to great lengths to teach people - including his teammates to pronounce his surname. He produced a handy video which can be seen below. Mourinho's comments must come as a further knock for Ashley Cole with the left-back having lost his place in the starting line-up to the 24-year-old Spanish defender. Cole has started just 19 matches this season but despite Mourinho's apparent lack of faith in him, the aging leftback looks set to be offered a one-year contract extension. The manager also reiterated his belief that his side are one in transition and they remain too inconsistent to challenge for honours this year. Despite Mourinho's claim Chelsea have lost just once in their last 12 league matches, since losing 3-2 to Stoke on December 7, having brushed aside rivals Manchester City, Liverpool, Manchester United and Everton in that time. However, an extra time loss to Sunderland in the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup and a fourth round exit in the FA Cup at the hands of league opponents City have seen an unusually early exit for the Blues on the domestic cup front. Wise heads: Terry (L) and Lampard (C) have been an integral part of Chelsea's rise in recent year . In the zone: With 13 seasons at Chelsea Lampard has plenty of experience in the Champions League . 'We are not yet a stable team, we are . not yet a team ready to perform consistently game after game, week after . week,' admitted Mourinho. 'We . are a team with little up and downs. Four victories, two defeats, I . think it shows a little bit the quality of the team but at the same time . we will beat that inconsistency.' The Special One also took the time to . speak about Brazilian play maker Oscar who has been paramount to much . of Chelsea's success this season. Having . sidelined Juan Mata to give the 22-year-old a more prominent role, . Mourinho acknowledged that Oscar is still continuing to grow as a . player. Brazilian wonder: Oscar takes aim during Chelsea's hard fought victory against Everton on Saturday . Copycat? Oscar's celebration after scoring a goal is reminiscent of Gareth Bale's trademark heart celebration . Flying high: Oscar takes on Michael Carrick during Chelsea's 3-1 demolition of Manchester United in January . 'Oscar has a fantastic talent; he plays a . second year in Chelsea, he plays more or less a second year also in the . Brazilian National team so he's coming step by step. 'Physically he needs time to put himself in a top condition, tactically he's a very open boy that wants very much to learn. 'Obviously technically he's a typically Brazilian talent so Oscar has also everything to make some history in the competition.'

"It was once a vibrant city, packed with neat rows of colourful homes surrounded by lush green parks. But now all that remains is a husk of Tacloban; the place that so many called home is now a grey and barren wasteland after deadly Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines city, crushing everything in its way. These heartbreaking aerial photos show how every corner of the city was torn up by the deadly storm. Scroll down for video . The official death toll from the disaster rose to 1,774 today, though authorities have said they expect that to rise markedly . Tacloban, a city of about 220,000 . people on Leyte island, bore the full force of the winds and the . tsunami-like storm surges Friday. The official death toll from the . disaster rose to 1,774 today, though authorities have said they . expect that to rise dramatically. They fear estimates of 10,000 dead are . accurate and might be low. The dead, decomposing and stinking, litter the streets of the city or are buried in the debris. Most . of the city is in ruins, a tangled mess of destroyed houses, cars and . trees, as these pictures show. Malls, garages and shops have all been stripped of food and water . by hungry residents. The . loss of life appears to be concentrated in Tacloban and surrounding . areas, including a portion of Samar island that is separated from Leyte . island by a strait. It is possible that other devastated areas are so . isolated they have not yet been reached. Most of the city is in ruins, a tangled mess of destroyed houses, cars and trees. Malls, garages and shops have all been stripped of food and water by hungry residents . Desperately needed food, water and medical aid are only trickling into this city that took the worst blow from Typhoon Haiyan - five days after the deadly storm hit. Nearly a week after what could be the . Philippines' deadliest disaster, aid is coming - pallets of supplies and . teams of doctors are waiting to get into Tacloban. But the challenges . of delivering the assistance means few in the stricken city have . received help. Presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said relief goods were getting into the city, and the supply should increase now that the airport and a bridge to the island were open. 'We are not going to leave one person behind - one living person behind,' he said. 'We will help, no matter how difficult, no matter how inaccessible.' The U.N. said it had released $25 . million in emergency funds to pay for shelter materials and household . items, and for assistance with the provision of health services, safe . water supplies and sanitation facilities. Pallets of supplies and teams of doctors are waiting to get into Tacloban - but the challenges of delivering the assistance means few in the stricken city have received help . The . USS George Washington is headed toward the region with massive amounts . of water and food, but the Pentagon said the aircraft carrier won't . arrive until Thursday. The U.S. also said it is providing $20 million in . immediate aid. Aid . totaling tens of millions of dollars has been pledged by many other . countries, including Japan, Australia and Britain, which is sending a . Royal Navy vessel. 'We need help. Nothing is happening. We haven't eaten since yesterday afternoon,' pleaded a weeping Aristone . Balute, an 81-year-old woman who failed to get a flight out of Tacloban . for Manila, the capital. 'There . is a huge amount that we need to do. We have not been able to get into . the remote communities,' U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said in . Manila, launching an appeal for $301 million to help the more than 11 . million people estimated to be affected by the storm. 'Even . in Tacloban, because of the debris and the difficulties with logistics . and so on, we have not been able to get in the level of supply that we . would want to. We are going to do as much as we can to bring in more,' she said. Doctors in Tacloban said they were desperate for medicine. Medics at a small makeshift clinic said they had treated around 1,000 people for cuts, bruises, lacerations and deep wounds . In Cebu, to the . southwest of Tacloban, the Philippine air force has been sending three . C-130s back and forth to Tacloban from dawn to dusk, and had delivered . £400,000 of relief supplies, Lt. Col. Marciano Jesus Guevara said. A lack of electricity in Tacloban means planes can't land there at night. Guevara said the C-130s have transported nearly 3,000 civilians out of the disaster zone, and that the biggest problem in Tacloban is a lack of clean drinking water. 'Water is life,' he said. 'If you have water with no food, you'll survive.' A team from Médecins Sans Frontières, complete with medical supplies, arrived in Cebu island Saturday looking for a flight to Tacloban, but hadn't left by Tuesday. A spokesman for the group said it was 'difficult to tell' when it would be able to leave. 'We are in contact with the . authorities, but the (Tacloban) airport is only for the Philippines . military use,' Lee Pik Kwan said in a telephone interview. There . are reports there is no evidence of any organized delivery of food, . water or medical supplies, though piles of aid have begun to arrive at . the airport. Some people lined up to get water from a hose, presumably . from the city supply. Thousands of typhoon victims were trying to get out of Tacloban. They are camping at the airport in a desperate bid to try and leave the ruined city . Doctors in Tacloban said they were desperate for medicine. At small makeshift clinic with shattered windows beside the city's ruined airport tower, army and air force medics said they had treated around 1,000 people for cuts, bruises, lacerations and deep wounds. 'It's overwhelming,' said air force Capt. Antonio Tamayo. 'We need more medicine. We cannot give anti-tetanus vaccine shots because we have none.' The longer survivors go without access to clean water, food, shelter and medical help, the greater chance of disease breaking out and people dying as a result of wounds sustained in the storm. Thousands of typhoon victims were trying to get out of Tacloban. They camped at the airport and ran onto the tarmac when planes came in, surging past a broken iron fence and a few soldiers and police trying to control them. Most didn't make it aboard the military flights out of the city. There is growing concern about . recovering corpses from throughout the disaster zone. 'It really breaks . your heart when you see them,' said Maj. Gen. Romeo Poquiz, commander of . the 2nd Air Division. 'We're . limited with manpower, the expertise, as well as the trucks that have . to transport them to different areas for identification,' Poquiz said. 'Do we do a mass burial, because we can't identify them anymore? If we . do a mass burial, where do you place them?' The city is now a grey shell of what it was: Tacloban bore the full force of the winds and the tsunami-like storm surges on Friday . Most Tacloban residents spent a rainy night wherever they could - in the ruins of destroyed houses, in the open along roadsides and shredded trees. Some slept under tents brought in by the government or relief groups. 'There is no help coming in. They know this is a tragedy. They know our needs are urgent. Where is the shelter?' said Aristone Balute's granddaughter, Mylene, who was also at the airport. 'We are confused. We don't know who is in charge.' Damaged roads and other infrastructure are complicating relief efforts. Government officials and police and army officers are in many cases among the victims themselves, hampering coordination. The typhoon destroyed military buildings that housed 1,000 soldiers in Leyte province. There were other distractions, including a jailbreak in Tacloban. Army Brig. Gen. Virgilio Espineli, the deputy regional military commander, said he wasn't sure how many of the 600 inmates fled. Officials fear estimates of 10,000 dead are accurate and might be low. The dead, decomposing and stinking, litter the streets or are buried in the debris. At Matnog, the port for ferries leaving for Samar island, dozens of trucks piled high with aid were waiting to cross. In Manila, soldiers loaded pallets of water, medical supplies and food into C-130 planes bound for the disaster area. For now, relief has come to a lucky few, including Joselito Caimoy, a 42-year-old truck driver. He was able to get his wife, son and 3-year-old daughter on a flight out of Tacloban. They embraced in a tearful goodbye, but Caimoy stayed behind to guard what's left of his home and property. 'People are just scavenging in the streets. People are asking food from relatives, friends. The devastation is too much. ... The malls, the grocery stories have all been looted,' he said. 'They're empty. People are hungry. And they (the authorities) cannot control the people.' The storm also killed eight people in southern China and inflicted hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to farming and fishing industries, Chinese state media reported Tuesday. The Philippines, an archipelago nation of more than 7,000 islands, is annually buffeted by tropical storms and typhoons, but Haiyan was an especially large catastrophe. Its winds were among the strongest ever recorded, and it may have killed more people than the previous deadliest Philippine storm, Thelma, in which about 5,100 people died in the central Philippines in 1991. The country's deadliest disaster on record was the 1976 magnitude-7.9 earthquake that triggered a tsunami in the Moro Gulf in the southern Philippines, killing 5,791 people.","The official death toll from the disaster rose to 1,774 today, though authorities have said they expect that to rise .

"Ashley is sick of women being made to feel guilty for having a  baby 'too late' At some point in the past few years, for me at least, Fertility has really become the F word. It's a notion that inspires guilt and regret in those of us over 40 as we are pummelled daily in the press for 'leaving it too late' and panic for those in their 20's and 30's, regularly admonished to forgoe both financial and emotional security in order to have babies immediately, in particular by successful, insanely wealthy television presenters who did nothing of the sort. For women in the thick of it, it's getting to be rather ugly. Regularly patronised by (predominantly male) doctors and lectured by smug married, financially well off mothers who offer unsolicited advice – fertility just isn't fun anymore. Additionally, I think the words that most of us associate with fertility with are other F words, like failure or fear. The failure to establish a stable relationship with a man who also wants children in his early 30's (which by the way is almost none of them) or the failure of your body to do what you always believed it could do. As a first time mother at 40, I understand these feelings all too well. Having your fertility tested, prodded, talked about and analysed at the same moment you are passionate about having a baby is utterly terrifying, no matter what your age or challenges. As an older woman who wants to get pregnant it is especially unpleasant. You are often made to feel as if you did something wrong. You know what? You didn't. Life and opportunities happen the way that they do for some of us and some things are simply out of our control. That is, if you believe in creating a child with someone you love, who is stable and emotionally involved, which I did. As I headed like an unstoppable bullet train towards 40, fertility became the word I most dreaded reading in newspaper headlines, most of which were heralding yet another new study outlining yet again how the odds were stacked against me. The sad truth of the matter though, as it is with most unpleasant realities, these things can't really be avoided; they exist whether we like them or not. And whilst It's undeniable that there is a lot of fear surrounding this word 'fertility', waiting to develop courage to tackle it is just another form of procrastination. As someone once said, the most successful people take action while they're still afraid. Next week is National Fertility Week aiming to help couples who are trying to get pregnant . And so, if you're like me, National Fertility Week, kicking off October 27-November 2nd is something you approach in equal parts scepticism and trepidation. From what I can gather, the thinking behind it is well intentioned. It's a week-long endeavour offering both men and women information geared to help increase understanding of fertility issues, which affect one in six couples in the UK. Susan Seenan, Chief Executive of the Infertility Network UK, says, 'Almost everyone will know someone who has experienced difficulties conceiving, which hopefully will encourage people to support the week.' There are some good resources available, if you know where to look. It's not all hype and it's not all bad news. And so, if you are someone for whom the word fertility has taken on a particularly unpleasant connotation, perhaps it's time to gently nudge yourself back into the conversation. Three of the UK's top female fertility experts are getting involved. And their voices are worth listening to. For the first time ever, mini-clinics will be offered free of charge to the public, giving women and men the chance to ask questions and gain insight into fertility options . During the week, the UK's leading fertility expert and 'Eat Yourself Pregnant' author Zita West is taking questions and offering advice at Crussh, Fit Food & Juice Bar locations all around London. For the first time ever, mini-clinics will be offered free of charge to the public, giving women and men the chance to ask questions and gain insight into fertility options. These mini-clinics will cover all aspects of fertility: including the role of nutrition, fertility MOTs and IVF information, as well as prepping for IVF. In honour of the event, Crussh will be designing a Zita West 'fertility juice', (from 'Eat Yourself Pregnant') and 50p from the sale of every Deep Cleanse Green Juice will go to the Infertility Network, the UK's leading infertility support network. To get dates and times contact ZitaWest.com or crussh.com . Zita says, 'My aim is to bring fertility awareness to the high street through consultation, in an environment where women and men can have their questions answered by me and my team of experts.' Zita's clinic, under the leadership of the renowned fertility expert Dr George Ndukwe has one of the highest IVF success rates in the world, if that is bit of a push. Launching October 31st, The Baby-Making Bible author Emma Cannon's new e-book, 'Fertility to Family.' Emma says, 'A major part of what I do as a practitioner is to support couples through fertility treatment; giving the patient some fine-tuning with acupuncture, helping the body and helping to create a calm mind. 'I know that food and thought are two of the core pillars that underpin a foundation for health. The process of going through IVF provides it own challenges and there is much you can do to support that process through preparation and during IVF treatment itself.' Emma outlines a healthy eating plan that assists with natural conception as well as a week by week diet for those going through the IVF process, available from October 31 on Amazon. Champneys in Tring is doing a fertility retreat with fertility specialist Dr Marilyn Glenville. The author and expert will offer those attending the 21-23 November course information on how to improve their chances of getting pregnant naturally. Marilyn, who wrote the best-selling Getting Pregnant Faster says: 'I see so many couples in my clinics struggling to conceive, it's always satisfying to help individuals better understand their bodies and what factors can affect their fertility, ensuring they are in the best possible shape to conceive.' Whether we like it or not questions and issues surrounding fertility are here to stay. The announcement this week that some companies are going to pay for female employees to freeze their eggs merely proves that these conversations are just beginning. When asked about overcoming fears on the road to finding success, Bill Cosby once said, 'Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it.' That's what I'll be doing during National Fertility Week anyway.","Ashley is sick of the stigma that surrounds fertility .
She says that it is often a subject that inspires guilt and regret in women .
She hopes that National Fertility Week will help to change that ."
"A mineral formed by biological processes has been found in rocks that were 12 miles (20km) beneath Earth’s surface 100 million years ago. If the finding is confirmed, it will be among the deepest signs of life ever discovered. And it could also have implications for life on other worlds, suggesting that more regions of Earth are habitable than we anticipated. Scientists from Yale University have found evidence for ancient underground life. A mineral called aragonite (stock image shown) was found in rocks that are now on the surface. A specific mix of carbon isotopes suggests the aragonite found came from subsurface methane made by microorganisms . The finding was made by a team from Yale University on Washington state’s Lopez Island. The mineral found in the rocks was something known as aragonite, which can form both biologically and by natural processes. However, in this instance the scientists found a specific mix of carbon isotopes that indicate it has biological origins. Back in June 2011 scientists were left stunned by the discovery of a worm that lives deeper than any known animal on Earth. The discovery of Halicephalobus mephisto, a new species, 2.2 miles (3.5km) below the surface in a South African gold mine amazed scientists as it had previously been thought that only single-celled bacteria could survive at such depths. The worm - a bacteria-feeding nermtode that is just 0.02 inches (0.5mm) long - was found at various depths of between 0.6 and 2.2miles (0.97 and 3.5km). It lives in the 48°C (118°F) water that seeps between cracks that are deep below the surface. 'It's like finding Moby Dick in Lake Ontario,’ Lead researcher Dr Tullis Onstott, of Princeton University said at the time. Carbon dating suggested they have lived at such depths for between 3,000 and 10,000 years in an environment with just 1 per cent the oxygen levels found in oceans. The worms may have originated on the surface but were washed down into the cracks of Earth’s crust by ancient rainwater. The findings suggest this aragonite came from methane made by microorganisms. ‘These really light signals are only observed when you have biological processes,’ Philippa Stoddard, an undergraduate at Yale University, told Live Science. The aragonite was found in an outcrop 165ft (50 metres) long that lies in a fault zone 1.9 miles (3km) thick called the Lopez Structural Complex. It’s thought the life may have originated in a subduction zone deep beneath the surface of Earth where two tectonic plates came into contact. Here, it may have been possible for water to be embedded in the subsurface rocks. Over 100 million years the rocks were gradually pushed upwards and are now seen on the surface. Exactly what sort of life it would have been is not known, but it would likely have been simply bacteria or other simple microorganisms. If life did survive at these great depths, it would have had to endure temperatures of more than 122°C (252°F). High pressure may have enabled life to live even at such high temperatures underground, but nonetheless it would be an extreme environment in which microorganisms could survive. And discovering life in such environments could aid scientists in their hunt for life on other planets besides Earth. The discovery was made in an outcrop of rocks on Washington state’s Lopez Island (shown). 100 million years ago these were 12 miles (20km) underground before being gradually brought to the surface. Life could have survive in the rocks between tectonic plates . It’s thought the life may have originated in a subduction zone (shown) deep beneath the surface of Earth where two tectonic plates came into contact. Here, it may have been possible for water to be embedded in the subsurface rocks. Over 100 million years the rocks were gradually pushed upwards . As life is found in more and more extreme environements, it raises hopes that some form of past or present microbial life may be found on other worlds in our solar system besides Mars. And it may ultimately force us to rethink the characteristics that enable us to label a planet beyond the solar system 'habitable', suggesting even more may be habitable than thought. ‘At low surface pressures, bacterial life is know to remain active to temperatures of about 122°C [252°F],’ the researchers write. ‘Biomolecules are stabilised by pressure, so bacterial life should extend to higher temperatures within the Earth's interior. ‘We suggest that the Lopez Island aragonite veins are evidence of this deep life.’ The team presented their findings at the Geological Society of America’s annual meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia. Life has already been found in a variety of bizarre environments on Earth. Here tiny crabs and other sea life live next to a hot hydrothermal vent on the ocean's floor. The heat and minerals expelled by the vent allow these creatures to survive without sunlight. The latest discovery could have implications for finding alien life .","Scientists from Yale University have found evidence for ancient underground life on Washington state’s South Lopez Island .

"America's position as the world's leading power inevitably makes it a love-it-or-hate-it nation. Such is the complexity of global politics and conflict, its reputation is constantly in flux - whether its providing humanitarian aid with one hand or diving into a war with the other. But a new survey has been released which could well give Washington a clearer idea about where to focus its attention in the coming years. The Washington haters: Figures from the Pew Research Center reveal the top ten biggest critics of the U.S. based on a survey of citizens from 44 countries . Friction: The biggest anti-U.S. sentiment comes from Egypt, which will come as a blow to President Obama, who made a speech in 2009 (above) that promised to seek a 'new beginning' for the U.S. and Muslims . According to the Pew Research Center, which questioned citizens in 44 countries, anti-American sentiment features strongly in the Middle East, while many of those in favour come from Europe and Asia. The biggest anti-American sentiment currently comes from Egypt, where 85 per cent held an unfavourable view of Uncle Sam. Meanwhile, only 10 per cent showed support for the U.S., which is viewed as having failed to oppose the overthrow of long-serving president Hosni Mubarak by the Muslim Brotherhood. The figures will come as a blow to President Barack Obama, who made an impassioned speech in Cairo in 2009 that promised to seek a 'new beginning' for the U.S. and Muslims in the wake of 9/11 and the subsequent Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Fanbase: Many in favour of the U.S. come from Europe and Asia, with The Philippines its biggest supporter . Pro-Moscow militants guard the MH17 crash site: In Russia, pro-America reaction has plunged 28 points in just one year to 23 per cent in large part due to America's opposition to its intervention in Ukraine . America is in more danger than it has been for years because of the Islamic uprising in Iraq, a top U.S. intelligence official has warned. Lt General Michael Flynn said Washington had been taken by surprise by the lightning offensive by ISIS despite knowing about their growing influence months ago. He was speaking a national security forum in Aspen, Colorado, where various counter-terrorism officials warned that the U.S. was being threatened by several emerging threats in the Middle and Africa. Asked if the United States was safer than it was a few years ago, he said: 'My quick answer is we're not.' But he said officials are 'working to organize ourselves better,' it was reported by ABC News. Second in the list is Jordan (with 85 per cent against and 12 per cent in favour) followed by Turkey on 73 per cent. Meanwhile, in Russia, which comes fourth, pro-America reaction has plunged 28 points in just one year to 23 per cent, while the number of critics has risen to 71 per cent. This is perhaps unsurprisingly due to Washington's opposition to Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea earlier this year and its ongoing antagonism in Ukraine, where pro-Moscow rebels have been blamed for shooting down flight MH17, killing 295 people. Palestinian territories complete the top five, with 66 per cent, but the 30 per cent who do like the U.S. is the highest since the survey started in 2002, according to GlobalPost. At the other end of the spectrum, however, American still has its fair share of fans. The Philippines are its strongest backers with 92 per cent and just 6 per cent opposed, followed by Israel (84 per cent), which GlobalPost notes has been sent some $115billion by the U.S. in foreign aid since the Second World War. In third place is South Korea (82 per cent) then Kenya (80 per cent) and El Salvador (80 per cent). In Europe, Italy comes out on top, with 78 per cent in favour.","85% have anti-American feelings in Egypt, according to a new survey .

"Posing provocatively on a sofa while wearing a tight glittering dress, it's easy to see how this curvaceous blonde caught Prince Harry's attention during his now-infamous night in Las Vegas. Carrie Reichert claims she kissed the young Royal in a naked 'drunken fumble' and that she was alone with Prince Harry in his hotel room for up to 20 minutes during a party in Nevada's Sin City last month. Since the scandal broke Prince Harry has been inundated by media attention, but newly-released photos of Carrie reveal that the 32-year-old is not averse to playing up for an audience. Scroll down for video . Tell-all: Blonde Carrie Reichert claimed  she was alone with Prince Harry in his hotel room for up to 20 minutes during a party in Nevada's Sin City last month . Strike a pose: The Royal was completely naked during their tryst, she claims, while she stripped down to a string bikini . The series show Carrie in a variety of poses including a snap of her in a cut-out black . swimming costume wearing sunglasses, which looks as if the beautician has . taken the photo herself in a mirror. In another photo seemingly taken on the same night as one of her posing on a sofa, Carrie is shown leaning against a balcony window with one leg against the glass while holding a large wineglass in her hand. She is the first woman to speak out about Harry's wild night in . Vegas, where he was pictured frolicking naked with a young woman during . a game of 'strip billiards'. Asked about the latest account to come out about the prince’s antics in Las Vegas, a St James’s Palace spokesman flatly denied the girl’s claims. ‘The story is untrue,’ they said. And a source close to the prince also questioned the woman’s account, saying: ‘This lady was not present with Prince Harry on the night in question or on any occasion.’ Invitation: The British-born beauty said she was approached by one of the Prince's entourage who invited her to party with them in his penthouse . Speaking out: The 32-year-old is the first woman to speak out about Harry's wild night in Vegas, where he was pictured frolicking naked with a young woman during a game of 'strip billiards' While she stripped down to a string bikini, she claims that Harry was completely naked during their tryst. However, despite the intimate nature . of their rendezvous, Carrie insisted their kiss was 'fun' and 'not . romantic'. She also claimed that, in spite of many people stripping off . at the party, it was not an orgy. Instead, she said, Harry was a 'gentleman' but added he was completely 'wasted'. Carrie looks more demure in a photo from her LinkedIn webpage in which she details her career and education . The spa-owner, . who had been visiting from San Diego with a group of girlfriends, . claims she was hand-picked to join the Prince's party after his friends . spotted her near the swimming pool at the Encore At Wynn hotel, it was . reported. The British-born . beauty said she was approached by one of the Prince's entourage who . invited her to party with them in his penthouse. She told The People: 'I'm not going to pass an opportunity to party with Prince Harry.' When she got upstairs, she said, the party was in 'full swing' with guests - and Harry - already naked. Wild times: Harry's partying in Vegas got him into serious trouble, forcing him into hiding when he got back afterwards. She added: 'Harry was already . undressed. It was just crazy, he looked actually delirious. There was a . pool table and he was playing air guitar with pool sticks.' Carrie said Harry took her by the hand and led her from the living room to his bedroom soon after introducing herself to him. Harry was already naked and she removed her dress to reveal a string bikini before she kissed him, she said. The pair then had a conversation about her childhood links with Britain before enjoying a 'drunken fumble'. She . added: 'We kissed for 15 to 20 minutes. I am sure someone stumbled in . as there were people going in and out of rooms all the time. We kissed . again and he said ""That was great"".' Controversial: Harry's now infamous trip to Vegas has been put in a little more context following today's news he is back in Afghanistan . The Prince had been spotted clearly enjoying himself with friends and young women at a pool party in Vegas . Carrie said they then both rejoined the party in the living room and carried on drinking until she went back to her hotel room. Harry was photographed on a mobile . phone in just a necklace with a naked female playmate hiding behind him . having played a game of strip pool in his VIP Las Vegas suite. Another . showed him giving the same topless woman a naked bear hug, which have . since been seen by tens of millions across the world. As well as the embarrassment, it did raise security fears about how well the prince was protected on his Vegas trip. Despite Met sources saying that there . was no security breach and that officers were not there to protect his . reputation, it is believed two of  Harry’s most high-ranking personal . protection officers have already been interviewed by their bosses back . in London. They were accused of watching him . being photographed playing ‘strip billiards’ in his Las Vegas hotel . suite but failed to take any action.","British-born beauty claimed she was alone with the naked Prince in his room .

"Ten years ago Porto, led by an enigmatic young coach by the name of Jose Mourinho, shocked the footballing world by winning the Champions League. But that same summer the team was dismantled. Mourinho jumped ship to join Chelsea, taking Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira with him for a combined fee of more than £30million, while the team’s playmaker Deco was lured to the Nou Camp by Frank Rijkaard. On Monday, Manchester City finally completed the signing of Eliaquim Mangala, for a fee of £32m, which took Porto’s income from transfer fees since they conquered Europe sailing through the £600m mark. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Eliaquim Mangala score with cheeky back heel volley for Porto . Shelling out: Defender Eliaquim Mangala cost Manchester City £32 million from Porto this week . VIDEO City finally announce £32m Mangala . Not the first: Deco moved to Barcelona immediately after Porto won the Champions League in 2004 . Rock at the back: Ricardo Carvalho was bought by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in 2004 as well . In the 10-year period between Mourinho’s touchline dash at Old Trafford and Mangala treading the now familiar path between Estadio do Dragao and the Premier League, 15 players – including the young centre-back – have left the club for more than £15m. And of the £614m transferred into Porto’s coffers, £145.8m of has come from English clubs. Chelsea got the ball rolling when they signed Carvalho and Ferreira, before going back to Portugal to take Jose Bosingwa off the 27-time league champions’ hands. The three Portuguese defenders cost Porto £2.5m in total, with Carvalho a product of their youth system. Chelsea spent 25 times that to take them to Stamford Bridge. Manchester United dabbled, unsuccessfully it has turned out, in Porto merchandise when they bought Anderson (a £4.4m signing from Brazilian side Gremio) for £27.2m. Liverpool splashed out £11.4m on midfielder Raul Meireles. And this summer it has been Manchester City’s turn – the Premier League champions showing patience to add Fernando and Mangala to their squad after courting the pair for more than six months. Porto’s expenditure during 2004-2014 stands at £293m, less than half the amount they have pulled in through player sales. In only one of the past 10 seasons have the club spent more than they have recouped in transfer fees, when they splashed out £35.2m in 2010-11, with Joao Moutinho, James Rodriguez and Juan Manuel Iturbe among those to join – three players that later left for a total of £75.2m. Cultured: Midfielder Joao Moutinho signed for Monaco alongside James Rodriguez two years ago . Moving on to better things: Rodriguez has just been sold to Real Madrid from Monaco after a good World Cup . 2004: Paulo Ferreira to Chelsea – £17.6m . 2004: Ricardo Carvalho to Chelsea – £26.4m . 2007: Anderson to Manchester United – £27.2m . 2008: Jose Bosingwa to Chelsea – £18m . 2010: Raul Meireles to Liverpool – £11.4m . 2014: Fernando to Manchester City - £13.2m . 2014: Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City - £44m (we are saying £32m) Their track-record for buying players at low prices from lesser-known clubs and selling them on at a huge profit is remarkable. Take Mangala for starters. Bought for just under £6m from Standard Liege in 2011, sold for five times that three years later. Rodriguez cost them £6.5m the previous year and fetched £40m when they sold him on to Monaco last summer. Then there’s Radamel Falcao. The Colombia striker signed for around £5m from River Plate in 2009, scored 72 goals in 87 games in all competitions, including 17 (SEVENTEEN) during their successful Europa League campaign in 2010-11. This prompted Atletico Madrid to break their club transfer record and shell out £41.4m on the striker. Other huge money-makers include Pepe, bought for £1.7m from Maritimo and sold to Real Madrid for £26.4m, and Lisandro Lopez, who joined for £2m from Argentine side Racing in 2005 and moved to Lyon for £21.1m four years later. Their scouting work in South America particularly stands out; Falcao, Rodriguez, Lopez, Anderson, Iturbe – all bought for a pittance and sold on for eye-catching fees. And that profitable passage shows no sign of drying up, with Jackson Martinez, Juan Quintero and Hector Herrera likely to be the next set of Porto players to move to pastures new for massive amounts for massive amounts. Destined for stardom: Anderson left Porto for Manchester United in 2007 for £27m - it hasn't quite worked out . If you've got the money: Raul Meireles (right), here battling Anderson, joined Liverpool . 2004: Paulo Ferreira to Chelsea – £17.6m . 2004: Deco to Barcelona – £18.5m . 2004: Ricardo Carvalho to Chelsea – £26.4m . 2007: Anderson to Manchester United – £27.2m . 2007: Pepe to Real Madrid – £26.4m . 2008: Jose Bosingwa to Chelsea – £18m . 2008: Ricardo Quaresma to Inter Milan – £21.7m . 2009: Lucho Gonzalez to Marseille – £16.8m . 2009: Lisandro Lopez to Lyon – £21.1m . 2010: Bruno Alves to Zenit – £19.4m . 2011: Radamel Falcao to Atletico Madrid – £41.4m . 2012: Hulk to Zenit St Petersburg – £48.4m . 2013: Joao Moutinho to Monaco – £22m . 2013: James Rodriguez to Monaco – £40m . 2014: Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City - £32m .","Received £614m in transfer fees in last decade, including the sale of Deco .

"'Highly respected': Mohammed Saleem Chaudhry, 75 who was stabbed to death in Small Heath, Birmingham, last night . A grandfather was stabbed to death just yards from his front door as he walked home from prayers at his mosque. Muhammed Saleem Chaudhry, 75, was discovered in a pool of blood by neighbours who were alerted to screams. He had been stabbed three times in the back and his head had been stamped on during the attack on Monday night. Yesterday his devastated family told of their grief at the loss of a ‘defenceless old man’, as police struggled to determine a motive for the brutal attack. Neighbours said the area had been blighted by gangs. The ‘highly respectable’ father of seven – who suffered from arthritis and walked with the aid of a stick – is not believed to have been targeted in a mugging gone wrong because his wallet was found in his clothing. Officers said they could not rule out the possibility the grandfather of 22 was the victim of a racist attack, and may have been followed for some or all of the half-mile journey from his mosque, but there was no evidence to support either theory. He was attacked opposite a primary school at 10.30pm, after leaving evening prayers at Green Lane mosque in Small Heath, Birmingham, where he prayed five times a day. Mr Chaudhry, a retired baker, was returning to his wife of 50 years, Said, who was in bed at the time of the incident. Yesterday, one of the couple’s five daughters, Shazia Khan, 45, said: ‘The surgeons told my mum they had never seen stab wounds so brutal before. ‘He was attacked in the evening on his own. To me it looks premeditated. I am utterly devastated.’ Her brother, Shahid, added: ‘My mum is absolutely devastated. Her world has fallen apart.’ Scroll down for video . Detectives have launched a murder inquiry after 75-year-old Mohammed Saleem Chaudhry was stabbed to death in this lane in Small Heath, Birmingham . Police officers were called by the ambulance service to Little Green Lane, in the Small Heath area of the city, shortly after 10.30pm, after reports the pensioner had suffered serious injuries . The scene in Little Green lane with the junction of Arsenal Street, . Small Heath, Birmingham, where a highly respected member of the community was stabbed to death . A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out later to determine the exact cause of death . Mr Chuadhry's nephew, Javid Iqbar, told how he had found his uncle, who carried a . walking stick, lying in a pool of blood after a frantic phone call from . his aunt. Mr Iqbar, 53, said: 'My auntie called me just after 10.30pm, and straight away I knew something must have been wrong. 'She just started shouting at me to come quickly, that Mohammed . had been hurt and she needed help. I raced round to their house and I . saw a figure lying in the street, with the neighbours standing over him. 'I dashed over and he was lying there motionless, in a pool of blood - he had obviously been very seriously attacked. 'The neighbours had heard shouting in the street and looked outside, and they saw him lying there. 'He had been on his way home from Mosque, where he had been for evening prayer. It was only a short walk from the house. 'They called an ambulance straight . away and woke up my aunt. My aunt was crying and begging for help. The . paramedics arrived and were trying to save him - they rushed him . straight to hospital and I followed them in my car. The stabbing happened in Little Green Lane in Small Heath, two miles from Birmingham city centre . 'When we got there, he was rushed . away at once, and then the doctors came out and told us that there was . nothing they could do. It was the worst night of my life. Our world fell . apart, my aunt is devastated. 'We can't understand why anyone would want to hurt Mohammed. He is a real family man and would never do anything to hurt anyone. 'I have no idea why he was attacked - . he was just a defenceless old man, walking on his own, late at night. This is a very tightly knit community, and everyone has been rocked by . the news. I just hope whoever did this will be brought to justice.' He lived with his wife, Said Begum, in a terraced house off Little Green Lane, just yards from where he was stabbed.

He was very well-respected in the community. He's such a lovely man. I just can't believe it. Everyone, old and young, knew him. 'Neighbours have told us they heard screams and called for an ambulance. It's thought he may have tried to fight off his attacker.' She said the father of seven and grandfather of 22 used to walk to the mosque five times each day. He had lived at the property off Little Green Lane with his wife for some 25 years and used to work at the RHM Bakery, which is now a Morrisons supermarket, before retiring some years ago, his daughter added. 'We just hope the police find who did this. It was him today, it could be someone else tomorrow.'To kill a defenceless old man who had a walking stick - well, it's just terrible.'

"The leader of an Islamist militant group which has abducted hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls today vowed to sell them as sex slaves despite international outrage at the kidnappings. Abubakar Shekau, the head of Nigerian extremists Boko Haram, said he would 'sell on the market' more than 270 girls captured by his fighters last month. The group – whose name means 'western education is forbidden' – snatched the children during a raid in the village of Chibok in northeast Nigeria last month, the French news agency AFP reported, citing a video it had obtained. In the video, Shekau declares: 'I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.' He is seen dressed in combat fatigues . standing in front of an armoured personnel carrier and two pick-up . trucks mounted with sub-machine guns. Scroll down for video . A grab taken from a video obtained by French news agency AFP which shows the leader of Islamist group Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau (centre), vowing to sell hundreds of captured schoolgirls as sex slaves . Shekau (centre) claimed responsibility on Monday for the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls during a raid in the village of Chibok in northeast Nigeria last month . His message comes after former . British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is now a UN special envoy on . education, led calls for Western governments including Britain to assist with their rescue. A . Foreign Office spokesman said the British government is in talks with their . Nigerian couinterparts and 'security services' but declined to say if that . might include special forces such as the SAS, according to the Daily . Telegraph. US Secretary of State John Kerry over the weekend also promised help. 'The . kidnapping of hundreds of children by Boko Haram is an unconscionable . crime and we will do everything possible to support the Nigerian . government to return these young women to their homes and to hold the . perpetrators to justice,' he said. The brazenness and sheer brutality of the school attack has shocked Nigerians, who had been growing accustomed to hearing about atrocities in an increasingly bloody five-year-old Islamist insurgency in the north.

Six armed men stand beside him with their faces covered. For the first 14 minutes, he takes a . swipe at democracy, Western education, efforts for Muslims and .

'Western education should end. Girls, . you should go and get married,' he said. 'I will repeat this: Western education should fold up. I abducted your girls.' 'I will sell them in the market, by Allah,' Shekau said, claiming his group was holding the girls as 'slaves'. 'I will marry off a woman at the age of 12. I will marry off a girl at the age of nine,' he said elsewhere in the video. Unconfirmed . reports from local leaders in Chibok suggested that the girls had been . taken across Nigeria's borders with Chad and Cameroon and sold as brides . for as little as $12. Demonstrators have taken to the streets of Nigerian cities including Lagos and Abuja in recent days to voice their displeasure at their goverment's failure to ensure the safe release of more than 200 school girls taken hostage over two week ago . Former Nigerian Education Minister and Vice-President of the World Bank's Africa division Obiageli Ezekwesilieze leads a march of Nigeria women and mothers of the kidnapped girls of Chibok, calling for their freedom in Abuja on April 30 . The kidnapping occurred the same day . as a bomb blast, also blamed on Boko Haram, that killed 75 people on the . edge of Abuja and marked the first attack on the capital in two years. The . militants repeated that bomb attack more than two weeks later in almost . exactly the same spot, killing 19 people and wounding 34 in the suburb . of Nyanya. The girls' abductions have been hugely embarrassing for the government and threaten . to distract attention from its first hosting of the World Economic . Forum (WEF) for Africa, this week. The apparent powerlessness of . the military to prevent the attack or find the girls in three weeks has . triggered anger and protests in the northeast and in Abuja. Last . month, authorities arrested a leader of a protest in Abuja that had . called on them to do more to find the girls. The arrest has further . fuelled outrage against the security forces. In . a televised 'media chat', President Jonathan pledged that the girls . would soon be found and released, but also admitted he had no clue where . they were. A social media campaign to raise awareness globally about the kidnapping is gaining momentum with celebrities including Mary J Blige adding their support . The failure to rescue the girls is a massive embarrassment to Nigeria's government and President Goodluck Jonathan . With . outrage growing over the failure to rescue the girls, thousands of . Nigerians took to the streets of the country’s largest city Lagos on . Thursday to protest at their government’s inability to find the victims. Protesters . around the world have also harnessed the power of social media using . hashtags including #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurDaughters to . demand that more is done. Celebrities . including singers Mary J Blige, Janelle Monae and Deborah Cox have . retweeted the call for more to be done to rescue the school girls. ‘If . 230 girls can go missing for this long and nobody knows how to find . them, then something's very wrong with our country,’ said Tokumbo . Adebanjo, 45, a travel agent and mother. ‘I feel the pain of those other mothers. Obviously the government are not doing their job.’ President Goodluck Jonathan has said . security forces are doing all they can to find the girls and the . Associated Press has reported that his government is in negotiations . with the terrorists who are demanding an unspecified ransom for the . students' release. News of negotiations comes as parents had claimed the girls were being sold into marriage to Boko Haram militants. The students are being paid 2,000 naira ($12) to marry the fighters, Halite Aliyu of the Borno-Yobe People's Forum told The Associated Press. She said the parents' information about mass weddings is coming from villagers in the Sambisa Forest, on Nigeria's border with Cameroon, where Boko Haram is known to have hideouts. The girls are between 16 and 18 years old and had been recalled to the school to write a physics exam when they were seized. About 50 of the kidnapped girls managed to escape from their captors in the first days after their abduction, but some 220 remain missing, according to the principal of the Chibok Girls Secondary School, Asabe Kwambura. Two of the girls have reportedly died from snake bites. The protests come as parents say the girls are being sold into marriage to Boko Haram militants . Attack: The militants struck in Chibok, in northwestern Nigeria, last month . The . demonstrators, including pregnant women, relatives of the girls and . civil servants, waved banners saying ‘Bring Back Our Girls’, the somber . mood of their rally accentuated by torrential rain that drenched . everyone. ‘The . leaders of both houses said they will do all in their power but we are . saying two weeks already have past, we want action now,’ said activist . Mercy Asu Abang. ‘We want our girls to come home alive - not in body bags,’ she said. The . demonstrators began their march outside the Hilton Abuja, one of . Africa's most expensive hotels, where in a week's time Nigeria will be . hosting the World Economic Forum under tight security, to be maintained . by 6,000 soldiers. A . senator from the region where the girls were taken has said the . government needs to get international help to rescue the girls. Boko Haram especially opposes the education of women.

"Fears that Americans were aboard doomed Malaysia Airlines flight 17 lingered into Thursday evening as the nationalities of 41 of the 298 dead remained unverified. The nation gasped earlier in the day when a widely shared Reuters story cited sources that put the number of Americans aboard at 23, but state authorities in the U.S. did not confirm any of those casualties. Now the Department of State must cut through the fog of confusion and misinformation to determine if any Americans perished when a surface-to-air missile knocked the Boeing 777 back to Earth. Scroll down for video . American victims? John Kerry's State Department has found that none of the MH17 passengers checked in with U.S. passports . Hours after the plane exploded over eastern Ukraine, the Department of State could do little to put American minds at ease. At nearly 8pm Eastern, the agency's press office said: . 'At this point we do not have any confirmed information about . casualties.  We offer our condolences to the families and loved ones of . all those affected by this tragedy. 'We are closely monitoring the . situation and are seeking additional information.  The U.S. Embassy in . Kyiv is in close contact with Ukrainian authorities on this incident.' As the evening wore on it appeared that no news could be seen as good news. The White House issued a statement confirming that they are still seeking information 'to determine whether they were any American citizens on board'. And as this search continues, pro-Russian separatists who control the area where the Malaysia Airlines flight was brought have announced they will allow FBI and NTSB officials access to the area in an 'advisory role'. Many press reports, however, used Reuters' citing of a source inside Ukraine to put the number of American deaths at 23. Debris: Smoke rises up at the plane's crash site near the village of Grabovo, Ukraine on Thursday afternoon after the Boeing 777 was shot down, killing all 298 onboard . Accounting for the dead: While Reuters early on cited a source that put the number of Americans dead at 23, that figure was not verified by any United States officials. However, many Netherlands nationals perished on their way to Kuala Lumpur. Here, people lay flowers in front of the Embassy of the Netherlands in Kiev Thursday . Reuters continued to keep that number on their website while noting: 'U.S. President Barack Obama said it was unclear whether Americans were aboard.' Meanwhile, other nations were certain they could begin to grieve the loss of their own. As of Thursday evening, Malaysia Airlines said victims hailed from the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Philippines, and Canada.

"The release of a new Hollywood comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean despot Kim Jong Un would be an 'act of war', one of his officials warned today. The U.S. faces 'stern' and 'merciless' retaliation if it fails to block the release of the film, said an unidentified spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He didn't mention the movie by name but was clearly referring to 'The Interview', which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco and will open in U.S. cinemas in October. Stepping into role: In the film  American born Korean actor Randall Park plays Kim Jong-un . The film tells the farcical story of a talk-show host and his producer who land an exclusive interview with Kim, and are then asked by the CIA to assassinate him. The 'reckless U.S. provocative insanity' of mobilising a 'gangster filmmaker' to challenge the North's leadership is triggering 'a gust of hatred and rage' among North Korean people and soldiers, the spokesman said. The film's release would be considered an 'act of war that we will never tolerate,' he said in remarks cited by North Korean state media. The threat came after North Korean agricultural workers held a rally in Nampho, south of Pyongyang, yesterday to vow to take revenge on the United States. The rally was held one day before the anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War. Thousands of workers stood in formation holding their right hands in a fist as they protested America's involvement in the three-year bloodbath, which began on June 25, 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea with weapons supplied by the Soviet Union. Anti-US rally: North Korean agricultural workers hold a rally in Nampho, south of Pyongyang, on June 24, 2014, to vow to take revenge on the United States . Anniversary eve: The rally was held one day before the anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War . Today marks the 64th anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War in which more than 1.2million soldiers died on all sides. Memories of that war are particularly painful in the North, where several cities, including Pyongyang, were all but destroyed by U.S. airpower. In Seoul, South Korean and American war veterans came together during a ceremony to commemorate the fighting. Meanwhile, an undated picture was released on Wednesday by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling North Korean Workers Party, showing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visiting a construction site of an orphanage in Pyongyang. The leader is seen cackling in the images.

Serious business: Kim Jong-un gestures during the visit . Salute: South Korean war veterans salute during a ceremony to mark the 64th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War in Seoul, South Korea on Wednesday, June 25 . A spokesman for Kim had earlier criticised The Interview, in which North Korea's Dear Leader is played by American born Korean . actor Randall Park. In the film's trailer, a . secret agent played by Lizzy Caplan says Kim must be stopped as his . people believe anything he says including 'that he speaks to dolphins . and doesn't pee or poo.' Kim . Myong-chol, executive director of The Centre for North Korea-US Peace and an unofficial spokesman for Pyongyang, dismissed . the movie. He told the Telegraph its assassination plot represents America's desperate foreign policy as a whole. Kim Myong-chol . told the paper: 'There is a special irony in this storyline as it shows . the desperation of the US government and American society. 'A . film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the U.S. has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. And let us not forget . who killed [President John F.] Kennedy – Americans.' International incident: James Franco and Seth Rogen's latest feature, The Interview, depicts the pair trying to kill the country's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un - and North Korea is not amused . Special access: James and Seth play talk show host and producer that have been chosen to interview the leader . The spokesman said America's history of backing political assassinations should be a concern to Barack Obama. 'In fact, President Obama should be careful in case the US military wants to kill him as well.' As for Rogen and Franco, while the Supreme leader may check out their film, it will never hold up compared to British films which the spokesman said were far better and realistic. Myong-chol said: 'James Bond is a good character and those films are much more enjoyable.' His love for Bond films is a little ironic considering in Die Another Day the spy is imprisoned and tortured in North Korea. North Korea, which has no independent press, often holds foreign governments responsible for the content of their media. Pyongyang regularly warns Seoul to prevent conservative papers from mocking or criticising its leadership, something banned within authoritarian North Korea, where the Kim family is revered. It is not the first time a Hollywood comedy lampooned a North Korean leader. Kim's late father Kim Jong-il was also targeted for assassination by the puppets of Team America. In that film, the leader is killed only to reveal that an alien cockroach was living inside his body and it survives and flies off on a rocket ship.","Threat comes on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War .

"The ex-professional footballers who planted a pompous flag in the moral high ground this weekend made me laugh. Some of them claim they never dived or went over easy in their careers but you can guarantee when they were playing they all appealed for a free-kick or a penalty they knew for certain wasn't theirs. There are levels of cheating, or trying to con the ref, and some may well be seen as worse than others. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley goes down during his side's 2-1 win against West Ham on Saturday . Barkley dived and won a free-kick after Hammers captain Kevin Nolan (right) avoided contact with him . But the reaction to Ross Barkley's dive has been totally over the top, and some well-respected football pundits need to have a broader view of the modern game - and not just throw in cliches because they know it pleases the public. Barkley went down without being touched, got straight up, didn't appeal for anything, and carried on playing. The referee Mark Clattenburg blew his whistle for a foul on the Everton player. So what exactly did Barkley do wrong? Those football observers in this country who have an unhealthy obsession with eradicating diving from the game will focus more on young talented English players, and they don't deserve it. It's all very worthy, but all so very unrealistic as well. For a start, Barkley does not have a reputation for cheating. So why pick on him after one incident? Barkley, pictured with West Ham's Mauro Zarate, is one of the most skilful players in the Premier League . Referee Mark Clattenburg awarded Everton a free-kick after Barkley's first-half dive . Secondly, some top players with a reputation for diving – Cristiano Ronaldo, Arjen Robben, Luis Suarez and even in the past, George Best – are footballers who like to have the ball at their feet and run with it. Defenders kicked them more than they kicked the ball. Why wait to be hacked down? If you're a skilful player who can skip a tackle, why stay on your feet and wait for your ankle to get smashed if you can avoid the potential injury and go down for a free-kick? Barkley is a player who runs with the ball – a rare breed from this country and we should be protecting him. He's not a baby, he will have to put up with knocks, kicks and bumps. But there's a limit. Of course Kevin Nolan didn't even make a challenge on Saturday in that incident, but Barkley has every right to protect himself. Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo (left) has a reputation for going down easily when challenged . Barcelona's Luis Suarez has been accused of diving to win free-kicks and penalties during his career . Everton fans will remember a foul from Nolan that caused an injury to Victor Anichebe, then a Toffee, which robbed the Nigeria international of his chance of playing in the 2009 FA Cup final. In fact it was such a bad foul Anichebe sued for loss of earnings. The case was settled out of court, Anichebe receiving a six-figure sum. Roberto Martinez is spot-on when he said after the game that Barkley had every right to 'expect contact.' Diving isn't something that should be taught or encouraged but it is very much a part of the global game of football and it's about time England faced that reality and got cuter in their approach. I don't want to win a fair-play trophy, I want to win a real one. If Barkley is kicked all over the pitch in the final game of the season, and then decides he's had enough so he dives for a penalty to secure Everton a top-four place in the final minute, the same high-principled ex-players-turned-pundits will be wailing and weeping. It makes you wonder if they've ever played the game. This challenge from Nolan (right) left then Everton striker Victor Anichebe seriously injured in February 2009 .","Ross Barkley dived to win a free-kick in Everton's win against West Ham .

"Danny Willett picked up the second European Tour title of his career after carding a final-round six-under-par 66 to convincingly win the Nedbank Golf Challenge in Sun City, South Africa. The Englishman holed six birdies on Sunday to finish 18 under for the tournament and seal a four-shot victory, beating fellow countrymen Ross Fisher and Luke Donald to the prize. It was a frustrating final round for Donald, who came into the final day leading by a shot on 13 under, but could only close with a one-over 73.

He ended up finishing two shots behind Fisher, who registered seven birdies and three bogeys in a final-round 68. Marcel Siem finished three shots further back on nine under after shooting a 68, while Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat was fifth on seven under. Willett's only other victory came at the BMW International Open in 2012 and he put this win down to an aggressive approach. 'My caddie John and I spoke at the start of the week and came up with a good game plan, to be aggressive off the tee on this golf course,' he said. 'It's visually very intimidating, but I've been driving the ball really well and we wanted to give ourselves a lot more wedges and nine irons into holes, whereas some guys are just laying back. 'We put a new Callaway driver in the bag a few weeks ago and it's been tremendous. Fellow countryman Ross Fisher finished second and conceded that Willett was 'too good' on the final day . 'It was just one of those weeks where the swing felt good and it came off. South Africa is a place that's suited me in the past and I've played well golf down here. 'I love the place, love the people - everything about it is great. It's been a truly fun test of golf.' Despite not finishing on top Fisher was pleased with his performance and felt there was little else that he or Donald could have done to prevent Willett's win. 'I'm delighted,' he said. 'I felt like I played great all week, and I finally started to hole a few putts today which was nice, but unfortunately for me and Luke, Danny was too good. 'I've been playing some really good golf for a long time and it's nice seeing the results starting to come good. 'I don't think Luke or I should be too disappointed.

'There are a lot of positives from the week,' he said. 'It's nice to put myself back in position. I could have played a bit better today, but I still would have had to shoot five under just to tie with Danny. 'He played really focused golf today and hats off, he's a deserved winner.

"When Susan Knight noticed her baby daughter had an irritation in one of her eyes, she assumed it was due to a pre-existing squint. But when Millie was three, surgeons correcting her eye condition noticed scarring on her right retina. After several trips to Great Ormond . Street, Millie was diagnosed with the rare condition known as Toxocariasis - which she had caught after ingesting the eggs . of the Roundworm parasite, Toxocara. There are around 50 cases reported each year in the UK, usually in young children. Millie, 13, has been on antibiotics since a parasite infection affected her vision. Undaunted, she now hopes to be part of the Team GB Winter Paralympic Ski team in the future . Toxocara is found in the faeces of dogs . and cats, and can contaminate the soil in gardens, parks and even . playgrounds. If accidentally ingested, the roundworm eggs hatch into . larvae that penetrate through the walls of the digestive tract and in rare cases can . migrate to the eyes and cause serious sight problems. Millie, who lives near Canterbury and had grown up on a farm, had spent her young life surrounded by animals and picked up the parasite when she was one. However, in her case the infection had remained dormant for several years and she had displayed no symptoms. Then when Millie was six the condition reactivated - unusually this time in her left eye. She experienced bouts of feeling poorly but it wasn't until her teacher noticed a decline in her sight at school that doctors realised what must have happened. Her mother said: 'We looked after all manner of animals when Millie was young, from sheep to household cats and dogs. 'Millie first contracted the condition at around the age of one, which remained undercover for years until it finally attacked when she was six. During a three week period, Millie had lost a lot of her sight. 'We were first referred to an optometrist and then swiftly to Great Ormond St Hospital, as Millie’s vision became worse. 'Millie ended up having to make weekly visits to Moorfields Eye Hospital, where the infected eye was treated with steroids. She has been on antibiotics ever since.' Millie has scarring in her central vision and is classified as B2 in disability terms - a stage between being blind and visually impaired. Toxocariasis is a rare infection caused by roundworm parasites (Toxocara). It is spread from animals to humans via their infected faeces. Ocular larva migrans is the least common but potentially most serious . type of toxocariasis. The condition can develop if the roundworm . parasites move into the eyes. The main symptoms of ocular larva migrans are blurred or cloudy . vision and irritation of the eyes. Left untreated, ocular larva migrans . can result in permanent vision loss, although only one eye is usually . affected. It affects around 50 people a year and usually affects young children. Treatment involves taking medication to kill the parasites. Most people will quickly make a full recovery and won't experience any long-term complications. Source: NHS . But . Millie wouldn't let the condition hold her back. Her mother said: 'She was as cool as cucumber and has coped so well. I'm very proud of her.' Millie had gone on a skiing holiday in France just before her sight deteriorated and was determined to continue with the sport. 'She really took to it and loved it,' Susan said. 'It is difficult as she can't see much of what she's skiing on and other people. 'But she never thinks of it as difficult, as she doesn't know any different. She also has headphones so she can talk to me while she's skiing.' Now 13, Millie has just returned from Austria, where she has been training with the . Team GB Winter Paralympic Ski team. She hopes to compete in the 2018 games, which will be held in South Korea. The best way to help prevent the rare condition is for dog owners to not only clear up after their pets but to regularly worm them as well. Maggie Fisher from the European . Scientific Counsel of Companion Animal Parasites, explains: 'The Roundworm (Toxocara) lives in animal faeces but can survive even . once owners have cleaned up after their pets. 'In fact, Toxocara is such a . resilient parasite it takes bleach and plenty of elbow grease to . eradicate it completely. 'The only way to be sure your pet is not . spreading this parasite is to worm regularly – this can be undertaken on . a monthly basis to break the life cycle of the parasite.' However, research from the ‘It’s a Jungle Out There’ report from Bayer Animal Health revealed that 75 per cent of owners do not regularly worm their pet, while half don't clear up after their dogs.

It was far from plain sailing for the world number 385, who had entered the final day with a four-shot lead before a poor start allowed Thanyakon to go two shots clear after nine holes. A two-hour rain break seemed to stall the Thai's momentum, however, and Harrington fought back to restore parity with his rival heading to the 18th. The Irishman skewed his tee shot to the edge of a hazard but Khrongpha failed to capitalise, finding the water with his second and registering a double-bogey six. Harrington recovered his composure, sinking a 15-foot putt to make par and secure a dramatic victory.

"Britain and its NATO allies spent billions freeing Libyans from the evil clutches of Colonel Gaddafi, but what exactly has replaced him? Democratic elections are still some way away, there's serious unrest in several cities and today a United Nations report reveal that up to 8,000 pro-Gaddafi supporters were being held by militia groups in Libya. Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay claimed they are being held in appalling conditions and are being abused and tortured. While Amnesty International state that detainees have died after being tortured by militias in detention centres. Tension: Libya's former rebel fighters, at a checkpoint near the town of Bani Walid. The new government says it will strike back if Gadaffi . supporters were behind deadly clashes in the town. Their claims were strengthened by . allegations of brutality in Misrata by the aid agency Medicins Sans . Frontieres, who have pulled out their staff. The organisation's medical staff said . they were were being asked to patch up detainees mid-way through . torture sessions so they could go back for more abuse. The agency said it was in Misrata, . about 130 miles east of the Libyan capital and scene of some of the . fiercest battles in the conflict, to treat war-wounded detainees but was . instead having to treat fresh wounds. Meantime, the UN's Mrs Pillay said the problem was down to militias working outside of government control. She added: 'The lack of oversight by the central authorities creates an environment conducive to torture and ill treatment. My staff have received alarming reports that this is happening in places of detention that they have visited.' Abuse claims: Ibrahim Mohammed says he was tortured at the . hands of the Gharyan city forces earlier this month. His claims support assertions by the United . Nations that torture and violence is widespread . General Director of MSF Christopher Stokes reinforced the UN assertions and said: 'Patients were brought to us in the middle of interrogation for medical care, in order to make them fit for more interrogation. 'This . is unacceptable. Our role is to provide medical care to war casualties . and sick detainees, not to repeatedly treat the same patients between . torture sessions. The agency said it has raised the issue with the authorities in Misrata and with the national army. 'No action was taken,' said Stokes. 'We have therefore come to the decision to suspend our medical . activities in the detention centres.' Rights . groups have repeatedly raised concerns about torture being used against . people, many of them sub-Saharan Africans, suspected of having fought . for Muammar Gaddafi's forces during Libya's nine-month civil war. Regime change: The UN insist abuses are still commonplace following the fall of Libyan dictator Gadaffi, right. While yesterday Libyan Defence Minister Osama Juili, left, said that the government was control of the country. Reports of the mistreatment and . disappearances of suspected Gaddafi loyalists have embarrassed Libya's . ruling National Transitional Council (NTC), which had vowed to make a . break with practices under Gaddafi and respect human rights. The allegations are also awkward for the Western powers which backed the anti-Gaddafi rebellion and helped install Libya's new leaders. The NTC has appealed to its citizens not to carry out reprisals against Gaddafi loyalists and it says it will investigate any abuses. There was no immediate comment from the NTC on the aid agency's allegations. The ability of the government in Tripoli to rein in torture is limited because, in most cases, it is carried out by locally based militias who are outside the NTC's chain of command. Human rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday it had evidence of several detainees dying after being subjected to torture, including some in Misrata. It quoted one man who said he had been tortured earlier this month in the headquarters of Misrata security forces. 'They took me for interrogation upstairs. Five men in plain clothes took turns beating and whipping me,' Amnesty quoted the man as saying. 'They suspended me from the top of the door by my wrists for about an hour and kept beating me. They also kicked me.'","8,000 loyalists loyalists being ill-treated by militia men - human rights report .

"Famous face: William Middleton who now has an embarrassing nickname - Bucket Heid . He hit the headlines after an embarrassing photo emerged of him with his head trapped inside a public litter bin. And now William Middleton has a suitably mortifying nickname to match - Bucket Heid. The 53-year-old had to be cut free by firefighters on Sunday as a bemused crowd in Aberdeen city centre looked on. Unfortunately for Mr Middleton, someone caught his ordeal on camera and posted the image online. Within 24 hours it had been seen by 4,000 people.

It was . shocking,’ he added. I was looking for my hat. I was stuck for about 20 . minutes. It was stinking. I’m now known as Bucket Heid.’ A passer-by dialled 999 and Grampian Fire & Rescue Service arrived about 5.45pm. Firefighters managed to cut free the . homeless man within 15 minutes, using a high-powered saw, but his . predicament had already attracted attention.

"John Humphrys said he is not a Google Glass convert . Here is a sentence I never thought I’d write. I am at the cutting edge of technology. Scoff as much as you like — and those who know me best will scoff the most — but the photograph accompanying this article provides some of the proof. It shows me wearing Google Glass — and only the privileged few can claim to have done that. Privileged? That’s a matter of opinion. I’ll address later the question of whether this particular piece of technology is, as Google claims, going to change the world, or whether it’s just rather pointless. But the fact is, I’ve tried it and you almost certainly haven’t, and I’m rather pleased with myself. Childish, maybe, but there it is. Not so long ago I’d have sneered at it. I was rather proud of being the very last journalist in the BBC newsroom to abandon his ancient typewriter for a computer — and it was not my choice. I came in one morning to discover that it had gone. My boss had had it removed and he personally escorted me down to the basement of TV Centre and ordered me to spend the morning being taught to use a computer. I hated it. Typing, for me, was as much a therapeutic as a creative process. I loved the buzz that came from hammering the keys as the deadline for the Nine O’Clock News drew nearer and I hated the delicate computer keyboards. If you were less than gentle with them, they broke. That was probably the beginning of my hostility to computer technology. When mobile phones made their first clunky appearance, I remember chairing a conference and agreeing with one of the expert speakers who said confidently they would never catch on because people would simply be too embarrassed to be seen appearing to talk to themselves in the street. Remember how we used to call them ‘poser’ phones? As for carrying one around, why would I want to do that? When texting arrived I wrote an article in these pages regretting the damage it was doing to the English language and I could see no reason to type out a message laboriously on a minute keyboard when you could make a quick call instead. Well, I’ve been converted — up to a point. I have not become a happy-clappy evangelist waving my arms in the air and shouting ‘Hallelujah!’ whenever the latest smart phone hits the shops. I am still profoundly irritated when the eyes of the person I’m trying to have a conversation with flicker to their phones just in case a new message has popped up — or when they talk long and loudly into them on the quiet coach of a train. The broadcaster was trying the Google Glass on Channel 4's Gadget Man presented by Richard Ayoade . So, not quite a Damascene conversion. But I do carry a mobile and use it for emails and apps  and photos and, yes, I text  pretty regularly. I am about to abandon my ancient answer-phone system — if only because I have grown to hate the voice of the woman who tells me so imperiously when I am trying to retrieve messages that I have entered the wrong pin and I can see perfectly well that I haven’t. I often read newspapers online and books on a tablet and I wouldn’t dream of spending hours slogging around shops to buy a lawnmower when it takes a couple of clicks on my laptop. The positive explanation for my conversion is technology works. The internet saves you time and money, and all those fears about being robbed blind if you dared risk putting your credit card details on a website proved pretty much unfounded. I love being able to carry dozens of books wherever I go and choosing what to read without needing an extra suitcase. It’s nice not getting lost in a strange city (well, not so often) because an app can give me a map, and how did we manage without search engines? All these benefits have been obvious for years, but the real reason for my own ‘conversion’ is, I think, a negative one. The fear factor has gone. This may seem perverse given so many of us complain endlessly about the tyranny of the mobile and how you will be turned into a block of salt if you are ever more than 18  inches away from yours. Every sentient parent worries about their children becoming slaves to their tablets, wasting their lives playing idiot games or, much worse, becoming victims of those monsters who stalk social media websites. The arms of the glasses is a touch pad and the wearer can scroll through text by sliding their finger along it . But the reality is that we are perfectly capable of controlling computer technology rather than allowing it to control us. To blame the mobile for the way society has changed is a bit like blaming the 19th-century inventor Henry Bessemer, who made cheap steel possible, for the Blitz. Mobiles are tools. Very useful tools, but that’s all they are. It’s not the fault of the Bessemer furnaces that bombs were made: it’s ours. And it’s not the fault of the internet that children are exposed to vile images or sexual predators. It’s the fault of the people who peddle the filth and, ultimately, our own fault for letting them get away with it. One answer, as this newspaper’s campaign has helped show, is more rigorous policing and much greater pressure on the internet service providers. As for those who spend their lives tweeting and then complain about being insulted, there’s no law that says you have to read the stuff. As a journalist, I think Twitter is a great way of finding out very quickly what lots of people think about lots of subjects, but I have neither the time nor the inclination to give a running commentary on my own boring life. Those who do the most complaining about the tyranny of technology are, I suspect, always the earliest of the  so-called early adopters. They are the people who must have the latest high-tech gadget the moment it appears and then must show the world they have it by using it. To ask whether they really need it is to miss the point entirely. Humphrys said he prefers his smart phone to Google Glass and said it does the same things . In my own case, when I started carrying a mobile I thought I was being terribly clever by keeping my number secret. I regarded it as a portable phone box: terrific for making calls when I was away from home, but I was damned if I’d be at everyone’s beck and call wherever I was at whatever time of day or night. That was stupid — and not only because once you call them they’ve got your number. The answer was obvious. Switch off. If they want to contact you, they send a text. And if you want to be contacted, you reply. Perfect. Which takes me, finally, to those funny specs I’m wearing in the photograph. Mine were supplied by the people from the Gadget Man programme on Channel 4 who were trying to tempt me to take a rather more adventurous approach to technology. To complete the story of my technological conversion it would be nice if I could say: ‘Yes! Just what I’ve always wanted: a tiny computer built into my glasses.’ The glasses are fitted with a miniaturised camera and web browser that displays digital information on a tiny screen in front of your eye. The arm of the headset is a touch pad. By sliding your finger up and down it, you can scroll through the text. Tapping the arm acts like clicking a computer mouse. Obviously there’s no keyboard, so you tell the glasses what you want them to do — they have a microphone, a tiny speaker and motion sensors to respond to head movements. And the image and the sound are surprisingly clear. The glasses are fitted with a miniturised camera and web browser that displays digital information on a tiny screen in front of the wearer's eye . So I’m a fan? I’m afraid not. I did feel slightly foolish wearing them, but you’d expect to get some odd looks if people see you talking to your glasses. So I asked my youngest son, who is in his teens and therefore really is at the cutting edge, what he thought about them. He said he’d feel rather silly wearing them on the street, too. Maybe that will change when (if) everyone has them. But there are other, bigger problems. I’m uneasy at the thought that the wearer can be videoing you without your even being aware of it. There’s the question of safety, too. I don’t fancy the idea of someone doing 70 in the outside lane of the motorway and watching a movie with one eye. The boss of Google says, as you might expect, that he wears his all the time. I think that’s scary. I don’t want to look into the eyes of someone and wonder whether they’re looking back at me or whether they are in an electronic world from which I’m excluded. But Google Glass is undeniably clever. You tell it to take a picture and that’s what it does. You ask it to give you directions or the weather forecast or show you a film or even translate something into other languages and it appears before your very eyes — or, rather, eye. Terrific. But I’ve already got something that does all that. It’s called a smart phone. And I’ve grown to like it.","The broadcaster and journalist said he is not a convert to Google Glass .

Mr Magola, 55, said: 'I found out I could train myself to manipulate lifeless objects as I studied for my degree in the early 90s. 'I have since spent years perfecting the technique and exploring further into human magnetism. 'I can defy gravity because I load myself with energy and - like moving a limb - can make objects do as I wish like a real life magnet. Villain: Sir Ian McKellen as Magneto in X Men 3 The Last Stand . 'I am determined to develop my unique powers further in the future and I'm currently working with telepathy and healing to see how psychokinetic energy can be put to a use that will benefit mankind.' In the hit X-Men comics and films, Magneto, who is played by Sir Ian McKellen, has the ability to manipulate electromagnetic fields meaning he can stop bullets in their tracks and levitate huge metal objects like submarines and tanks. Mr Magola's powers may seem like something out of a comic book, with many people struggling to comprehend his abilities - others flatly refuse to believe him. But the father-of-one refuses to be branded a 'fake' or 'cheater', revealing that his superpowers could potentially be mastered be everyone. Mr Magola added: 'Magnetic people prove with mind power they are capable of lifting objects of different materials off the floor without aid. 'This can be done with the head or palms of the hands to hold objects vertically, horizontally or in circular movements. 'Some magnetic people are also capable of lifting objects from the floor with the palm of a gloved hand or even with talcum powder on the skin. 'You don't have be a scientist to see the difference in the demonstrations between magnetic people and sceptics, who attempt to fool people uses cheating techniques.

One of Mr Magola's . main goals is to scoop a $1million prize - unclaimed for five decades - . set for anyone who can prove they have supernatural powers. The One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge was launched by famed magician and sceptic James Randi in 1964 for anyone who can show evidence of faith-healing, telepaths, psionics, dowsing, precognative psychic friends with astral bodies, past life remembrance, or spectral manifestations of any kind. Mr Magola is in training to banish popular myths surrounding human magnetism - as many claim people simply have 'sticky skin' - and intends to beat the feat in the near future. Mr Magola claims that after researching the phenomenon of psychic energy he developed the ability to exert mind over matter and connects himself to objects . Mind power: Mr Magola claims his powers allow him to manipulate plastics as well as metals . He added: 'I have been waiting many years, training and researching techniques, in order to challenge for the $1million prize.

'Unfortunately to date, no one has passed the preliminary tests, but we always welcome new challengers.' The control and power of psychokinesis is largely unknown, but many parapsychologists believe people can train their mind in order to affect the physical world. Metaphysics expert Dr Ellie Crystal said: 'Everyone has the potential to be able to be telekinetic. 'Telekinesis is created by higher levels of consciousness. It cannot be created by 'wishing it' to happen on the physical level. 'The energy to move or bend an object is created by a person's thoughts created by their subconscious mind.'","Miroslaw Magola, 55, claims he uses mind power to lift metals .

"Cruel online trolls could face Federal Police charges if they refuse to remove offensive posts after being handed warnings as part of a government battle against cyber bullying. Social media giants such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram will also face charges if they fail to comply with new rules about removing hurtful comments. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications Paul Fletcher announced new laws will be brought in by the end of the year and will provide the government with the ‘ability to serve notices to bullies’. Scroll down for video . In the last year in Australia 463,000 young people have been bullied online (stock photo of a child shown) Speaking at the Protecting Children & Youth Online conference on Tuesday, Mr Fletcher outlined the need for the new laws. He explained how children, parents and teachers are often ‘unsure of what to do when they have been the victim of cyber-bullying’. ‘Cyberbullying can have very serious effects, including anxiety, depression, behavioural problems and even suicidal thoughts,’ Mr Fletcher said. He pointed out how ‘the posting of humiliating or harmful photos, videos, or rumours is often exacerbated by other social media features (such as ‘comments’, ‘shares’ and ‘likes’) which can rapidly promote and spread the damaging content’. Social media giants such as Twitter, Facebook (left) and Instagram (right) will also face charges if they fail to comply with new rules about removing hurtful comments . Paul Fletcher pointed out how social media can exacerbate problems with features such as ‘comments’, ‘shares’ and ‘likes’ Mr Fletcher said evidence suggests children want the material taken down quickly but it is often difficult to work with the social media companies to make this happen. As part of the cyberbullying crackdown, a Children’s e-Safety Commissioner will be appointed to administer a two-tiered scheme for social media sites. Tier 1 is a voluntary scheme, and if sites fail to adequately address cyberbullying issues under the voluntary scheme, under Tier 2 there will be a formal legal requirement and civil penalties for a failure to comply. The e-Safety Commissioner will also have the ability to serve notices against a person who has posted cyberbullying material targeted at an Australian child. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications Paul Fletcher announced the new laws during a speech on Tuesday . However, unlike the social media sites, that person will be referred to police instead of being fined. ‘The legislation will not include the power for the Commissioner to fine end users who fail to respond to a notice, because we are wary of imposing fines on children. ‘Rather, the next steps available to the Commissioner, if the recipient of the notice fails to respond, will include going to court to seek an injunction; and referring the matter to the police,’ Mr Fletcher said. The newly-appointed Commissioner will act as the person for schools, police and parents to turn to when they don’t know what to do about a cyberbullying incident. The move comes after the government commissioned a report by researchers at the University of NSW, the University of South Australia, the University of Western Sydney, the Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre and the National Children’s and Youth Law Centre to understand the scale of the cyberbullying problem. The report highlighted how there is not currently enough legal help for those being bullied and that over a 12 month period, 20 per cent of Australians aged 8-17 have been taunted online. This means that in the last year in Australia 463,000 young people have been bullied online. It found cyberbullying was most prominent in children aged between 10-15. Meanwhile, 87 per cent of secondary schools reported at least once instance of cyberbullying in 2013, as did just under 60 per cent of primary schools. The new laws will only relate to children and not adults who are being cyberbullied, Mr Fletcher confirmed. Mr Fletcher said children, parents and teachers are often 'unsure of what to do when they have been the victim of cyber-bullying’ A spokesman for Mr Fletcher explained: 'In our society, there are a range of areas where we put in place extra protections for children in recognition of the fact they are not necessarily able to make judgements or protect themselves in the same way that adults are. 'Consistent with this principle, the Coalition’s measures focus on greater protections for children against the threat of online bullying. The policy we took to the 2013 election was specifically to enhance online safety for children.' He added that there are no plans to introduce additional measures in relation to adult cyberbullying. 'Of course, there are existing criminal laws which apply to using the internet to menace and harass, and adults who are the victims of cyberbullying are able to use these laws, just as children are,' he said. Mr Fletcher said in his speech on Tuesday: 'Some have seen them [the new laws] as a threat to freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is a vitally important value – and so we have sought to carefully limit any impact on freedom of speech with two specific design features. First, these measures will apply only to communications directed at children; they have no impact on speech between adults.'","Around 463,000 Australian children were bullied online in the last year .

"A Mexican national who fatally beat a former Baylor University history professor in 1997 was executed Wednesday night in Texas. Ramiro Hernandez-Llanas, 44, was lethally injected in the state's death chamber in Huntsville. In October 1997, while he was in the U.S. illegally, Hernandez-Llanas led 49-year-old Glen Lich from his house by telling him . that there was a problem with a generator, then repeatedly clubbed him . with a piece of steel rebar. Armed with a knife, he then attacked Lich's . wife. She survived and testified against Hernandez-Llanas, who also had . been linked to a rape and a stabbing. Ramiro Hernandez-Llanas was executed by lethal injection Wednesday evening in Texas for the  1997 fatal beating a former Baylor University history professor . Just 10 days before the murder, Lich had given Hernandez-Llanas a job helping with . renovations at his ranch near Kerrville, about 65 miles northwest of San . Antonio, in exchange for living quarters. Strapped to a gurney inside the death chamber, Hernandez-Llanas asked for forgiveness. 'I'm happy... I am sorry for what I have done,' he said, speaking in Spanish during a nearly five-minute final statement. 'I'm looking at the angel of God.' He blew kisses to family members and also thanked prison officers and the warden. 'I say this with a lot of love and happiness: I have no pain and no guilt. All I have is love,' he said. As the lethal concoction took effect, he snored loudly twice, then appeared to go to sleep. He was pronounced dead 11 minutes later, at 6:28 p.m. Hernandez-Llanas was the second Texas inmate to receive a lethal injection of a new supply of pentobarbital. Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials have refused to identify the source of the powerful sedative, contending secrecy is needed to protect the drug's provider from threats of violence from capital punishment opponents. Texas and other states that have the death penalty have been scrambling for substitute drugs or new sources for drugs for lethal injections after major drugmakers — many based in Europe with longtime opposition to the death penalty — stopped selling to prisons and corrections departments.Hernandez-Llanas' appeals were exhausted, and the Texas parole board on Tuesday refused to delay his death sentence or commute it to life in prison.

On Wednesday, the Mexican government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement condemning the execution. 'This is the fourth case of a Mexican being executed in clear violation of the judgment of the International Court of Justice,' the ministry said. 'The Government of Mexico expresses its most vigorous protest at the failure to comply.' Hernandez-Llanas was in Texas after escaping from a Mexican prison, where he was serving a 25-year sentence for a 1989 bludgeoning murder in Nuevo Laredo. He was linked to the rape of a 15-year-old girl and a stabbing in Kerrville. While awaiting trial, evidence showed he slashed another inmate's face with a razor blade. In prison, he was found with homemade weapons. 'This is exactly why we have the death penalty,' Lucy Wilke, an assistant Kerr County district attorney who helped prosecute Hernandez-Llanas, said ahead of the execution. 'Nobody, even prison guards, is safe from him.' Hernandez-Llanas was the sixth prisoner executed this year in Texas, the nation's busiest death penalty state.","Ramiro Hernandez-Llanas beat 49-year-old Glen Lich with a piece of steel rebar repeatedly .

"Prince Harry is planning on proposing to his girlfriend Cressida Bonas by the end of the year, royal insiders have predicted. The Prince, 28, has been dating the 24-year-old dance student since July last year but sources have claimed the relationship has become far more serious and they are bracing themselves for an engagement announcement. Harry sparked rumours earlier this month when he whisked Cressida off on a romantic African safari, just like his brother William did with Kate in 2010 when he asked her to marry him. Sources claim Prince Harry is on the verge of proposing to girlfriend Cressida Bonas . The Daily Star Sunday quoted sources who said Prince Harry has joked in private that a proposal could be made 'any day' now. The insider told the newspaper: 'The way it's looking now people close to Harry and Cressida predict an engagement by the end of the year and a spring wedding. 'Cressida is The One. People have heard Harry talking about how special Cress is and about getting engaged.' The source claims the Prince, an Apache helicopter pilot, has proved how serious he is about their relationship by taking her to Africa to show her the work he does with anti-landmine charity the HALO Trust in Angola. It was a cause championed by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales and is also one close to his heart. Prince Harry recently sparked engagement rumours by taking Cressida on safari in Botswana following a charity trip to anti-landmine charity the HALO in Angola . The charity is close to Prince Harry's heart and was one championed by his mother Princess Diana . His mother visited minefields being cleared by the charity just before her death in 1997. Their safari trip to Botswana also echoed the holiday Prince William and the future Duchess of Cambridge had in Kenya when he proposed to her in October 2010. According to The Daily Star Sunday, Kensington Palace is preparing itself for an engagement announcement and security teams are even accommodating it in their duty rotas. Dancer Cressida, who recently graduated from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Greenwich, avoids the public eye wherever possible and the couple are very careful about being photographed together. Sources say that Cressida Bonas (pictured right with sister Isabella Calthorpe) is The One . However, they were seen arriving at Kings Cross Station together following the society wedding of the year of Thomas van Straubenzee and the Duke of Northumberland's daughter Lady Melissa Percy in June. Prince Harry's ex Chelsy Davy was a bridesmaid at the wedding. The pair split for good in 2011 after a seven year, off-off relationship and it is believed the pressures of the intense spotlight contributed to the break up. Other than Cressida, Chelsy is the Prince's only serious relationship although he has been linked to a number of blondes. He has previously dated lingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce but they split in August 2011. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said it was a private matter and declined to comment.

"From the outside, Ukraine's Ministry of Revenue building looks rather non-descript. But step inside and a secret world of pleasure awaits... at least it did until the country's government collapsed in February amid violent protests. Instead of the standard company gym, tax officials had an array of luxuries to keep them entertained - from a giant jacuzzi and boxing gym to a sauna, massage tables, and even a salt room. Scroll down for video . Ukraine's Ministry of Revenue building looks rather non-descript from the outside but it houses many surprises, including a boxing gym . Phil Black (front left), from CNN, was recently given a guided tour of the premises, which revealed the astonishing extent of corruption while the country was under the watch of now ex-president Viktor Vanukovych. Above, the massive jacuzzi in one of the 'secret' rooms . A ceiling fresco in one of the tax ministry's entertainment rooms (not coming to an HMRC office near you...) Phil Black, from CNN, was recently given a guided tour of the premises, which revealed the astonishing extent of corruption while the country was under the watch of now ex-president Viktor Vanukovych. Behind one locked door, for example, lies a boxer's paradise. Lower-level tax workers assumed the room contained a secret jail, as they often heard yelling from within. The noise was, in fact, bareknuckle fighting matches which were put on for the entertainment of government VIPs. Another room reveals even more surprises... and is just the place to unwind after a hard day's work milking the system. Behold the massive jacuzzi (with complicated control panel); angelic fresco on the ceiling; a deluxe sauna; plus a cold-water bucket room for that post-steam cool-down. Right up there in 'things least likely to be found in a tax office'... a stand-up tanning booth . The salt room - walls, floor, and ceiling covered in sodium chloride - was also made available to dignitaries of the corrupt regime . After a busy day massaging the figures, what better way to unwind than a trip to the massage table? The average Ukrainian wage is less than a dollar an hour - but such details did nothing to assuage the guilt of the government cronies. And it was a different sort of guilt - namely gilt - which greeted dignitaries when they went to the bathroom: gold glitter decorations at every turn to make the call of nature that much more bearable. Down the hall lie yet more forms of relaxation: a cryo sauna - a form of extreme cold therapy - for the elite; and a stand-up tanning booth. And finally, the piece de resistance in the last chamber: a salt room. Here, the walls, floor and ceiling are all covered in the white stuff, which is apparently good for you to breathe in. It's just a shame they didn't care so much about the health of their country. Spending a penny? More like spending a fortune in the tax office bathroom . The exterior of the revenue office gives little away to reveal the extravagances that lie within . Anything to say, tax minister Klimenko? The former minister responsible for the tax office, Alexandr Klimenko, was unavailable for comment. According to security video, he was last seen fighting his way through a metal detector at Donetsk airport as he made a desperate attempt to flee the country. The footage, from February 22, appears to show Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka, Klimenko and their bodyguards in chaotic tussles. The pair, who were close allies of Vanukovych, were blocked from leaving the country. A huge portrait of Alexandr Klimenko, the minister responsible for the tax office, hangs on a wall in the building . It was the same day Pshonka was ousted from the fast-collapsing regime with a vote of no confidence in Ukraine's parliament, as deadly clashes raged in the streets of the capital Kiev. Days later, Pshonka's opulent mansion near the capital Kiev was stormed by anti-government protesters, who revealed it was filled with crystal chandeliers and plush golden furniture. Opulent to the extreme, the lavish estate was just one of several extravagant homes inhabited by the country's former leaders and top officials. The house in the village of Gorenichy outside Kiev was having its value assessed by experts after its owner went on the run. However, it was only one of Pshonka's homes. He also had the use of a hunting lodge around 20 miles away on a compound with two other lodges, one of them for the use of the deposed president Yanukovych. The hunting estate was also entered by opposition activists, who reportedly found guns and removed files. The scale of the opulence of homes used by public officials is seen by opposition activists as proof of large-scale corruption among the country's elite, one of the key causes of public anger which led to the protests in Kiev and other cities.","Also in the building: massage tables and cryotherapy chamber .

"A couple returned home from the cinema to find a naked man had beaten their grandparents to death and was raping their two-year-old daughter. Touch Chea, 71, and his wife, Sorn Sreap, 73, were found dead in Anchorage, Alaska, on Saturday night from significant blunt force injuries. Police said both Sreap and the toddler were raped. Officers arrested Jerry Andrew Active, 24, as he fled the east Anchorage homicide scene wearing just his boxer shorts. Suspect: Jerry Andrew Active tries to shield his face during his arraignment on charges of murder and sexual assault of a minor in the Anchorage jail court on Sunday . Active was arrested about a block from an apartment where the bodies of Sorn Sreap and Touch Chea were found dead on Saturday night by their granddaughter, who had returned from a trip to a movie with her husband . Registered sex offender: Active spent time in jail in 2010 and 2011 for a similar attack four years ago and was on probation . The registered sex offender was later charged with first and second-degree murder, sexual assault and burglary. Active was on parole for an almost identical attack he committed four years ago, according to the Anchorage Daily News. In 2009 he entered a home in Togiak and sexually assaulted an 11-year-old girl while the family slept. He then attacked three members of the family. The 24-year-old served time in jail for attempted sexual abuse of a minor and trespassing in 2010 and 2011, court records show. He was charged with violating his probation this . spring and was supposed to be on probation until 2014. Police said the younger couple, who . are in their twenties, went to a movie on Saturday night with their son and left . the two-year-old in the care of Chea and Sreap. They returned shortly before 8pm and found the door locked from the inside by the chain, but peeking through they could see the body of one of their grandparents. The father told police he forced his way in through a window and discovered the bodies of Chea and Sreap. They then discovered a naked man in the bedroom with their daughter. His wife called 911 and police dispatchers heard screaming over the phone. She reported a man had broken into her home and killed her . grandmother, Sreap. The man was described as being naked with several . tattoos. The wife, who is . pregnant, and her husband tried to keep the suspect from leaving and a . struggle began, Police Sergeant Slawomir Markiewicz said. The suspect, by then wearing boxer . shorts, was able to get away after a few minutes of fighting, Markiewicz . said. Officers found Active about a block away. 'He did offer some resistance but he was arrested,' Markiewicz said. The suspect apparently entered the apartment through a window, Markiewicz said. The two-year-old was taken to hospital for a forensic physical examination, and it was discovered that she had also been physically assaulted. She was taken to a hospital where she underwent surgery for her injuries. Scene: The victims were part of an extended family that lived in a ground-floor, east Anchorage apartment with their granddaughter and her husband . Accused: The registered sex offender was charged with first and second-degree murder, sexual assault and burglary . Merciless: Active entered the apartment through an open window and locked it from the inside so he could commit the horrific acts . The double homicide happened Anchorage, Alaska. Police said they were affected by the brutality and the ages of the victims . Social media: Active had a number of menacing and ominous pictures on his MySpace account . Investigators were affected by the brutality and the ages of the victims, police department spokeswoman Anita Shell said. 'They said this was the worst thing they had ever seen in their lives, and these are seasoned detectives,' Shell said. Police Sergeant Slawomir Markiewicz said yesterday that there are no indications that the victims were connected to the suspect. 'It doesn't appear that he knew them,' he said. 'It looks like a totally random act.' The . victims were part of an extended family that lived in a ground-floor, . east Anchorage apartment with their granddaughter and her husband, who . are the parents of the toddler and her four-year-old brother. The younger couple's 90-year-old great-grandmother also lives in the apartment and was at home during the incident. Markiewicz said the case is unusual. 'It's certainly very rare to see this kind of violence - a complete stranger, sexually assaulting and murdering someone,' he said. The bodies of Sreap and Chea were taken to the state medical examiner's office for autopsies. Names of the toddler and her parents were withheld.","Touch Chea, 71, and Sorn Sreap, 73, found dead in Alaska .

"Hacked to death: Lt Col David Parkinson (right) was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja (left), in Kenya . A former Parachute Regiment colonel has been hacked to death by a gang of machete-wielding  robbers in Kenya. Lt Col David Parkinson, a nature reserve manager, was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja. It is understood the 58-year-old retired colonel died defending the mother of his two children, who managed to escape by fleeing to a secure ‘panic room’. The distinguished soldier was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where Prince William spent his gap year as a 19-year-old and where he proposed to Kate Middleton nine years later. Lt Col Parkinson, a former grammar school pupil from Brighton, was awarded an OBE at St James’ Palace by Prince Charles in 1998 for his military service. The father of two was attacked at 2am yesterday in his home in the Lolldaiga Hills, a 49,000-acre wildlife ranch in the foothills of Mount Kenya. There were unconfirmed reports that he may also have been shot, in addition to being attacked with broad-bladed machetes known as pangas. Last night, Kenyan police said the retired soldier’s hand was cut off as he struggled with the intruders in order to give his wife enough time to reach safety. Local police chief Maurice Tum said the robbers gained entry by smashing the windows and ordered Lt Col Parkinson to hand over money and guns. Tragedy: Lt Col David Parkinson was killed in the farmhouse of the Lolldaiga Hills ranch in Kenya (pictured) He added: ‘A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely. 'The . wife hid in the strong room. It was this decision which saved her. She . came out and found her bleeding husband and contacted the police.’ Lt Col Parkinson, who served in the Army for 30 years, became manager of the ranch after leaving Lewa in 2008. Before taking up his place at St Andrews University, Prince William spent his gap year at Lewa, helping with various conservation projects. In 2010, he and Kate holidayed there, staying in a secluded rustic log cabin where William proposed. The Duchess said: ‘He’s a true romantic and we had a wonderful holiday in Africa. It was very romantic and it was a very personal time for both of us.’ Last night the Duke of Cambridge, who is a patron of Lewa, said he was ‘saddened’ to hear about Lt Col Parkinson’s death. Mrs Parkinson, who owns a local arts and crafts company called Mitumba Art, was taken to hospital and treated for shock. 'Saddened': The soldier was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where Prince William (right) spent his gap year as a 19-year-old and where he proposed to Kate Middleton (left, with Prince George) A friend and neighbour said: ‘He was very . dynamic, doing an amazing job in Lolldaiga for both conservation and . the community. He was a very well-liked man.’ Lt Col Parkinson joined the Army in 1973 after graduating from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. 'A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely' Maurice Tum, local Kenyan police chief . Known to his fellow soldiers as Parky, he joined the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces, before becoming chief instructor at Sandhurst. On his last tour before retiring, he commanded the British Army training organisation in Nairobi. In 2003, he and his wife permanently relocated to Kenya where he took up his post with Lewa, a growing conservation and community development project. The couple sold their home in Hassocks, West Sussex, for £500,000 three years later. They have two daughters, Anna, 33 and Renate, 29. Lt Col Parkinson took up the post with Lolldaiga Hills at the start of this year. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in Kenya and our team at the High Commission in Nairobi are providing consular assistance.’","Lt Col David Parkinson, 58, attacked as he slept beside wife Sonja .

"Call for vigilance: Metropolitan Police's Assistant Commissioner, Cressida Dick has warned that UK Muslims are guilty of 'complacency and passivity' over the threat from home-grown jihadists . Muslim communities in Britain are guilty of ‘complacency and passivity’ over the threat from home-grown jihadists, the UK’s top counter-terrorism officer warned last night. The Metropolitan Police’s Assistant Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said there were many cases where ‘warning signs’ about extremists were not brought to the attention of authorities. She also indicated some Muslims were too accepting of radical views, saying it was the police’s ‘greatest challenge’ to make them ‘wholly hostile to violent extremism’. Her comments came as the Government was confronted with a damning assessment by a former head of the military of Britain’s capacity to confront terrorism. Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, chief of the defence staff until last year, said the military was ‘not good enough’ to deal with the global threat from jihadis. The crossbench peer, formerly General Sir David Richards, called for a rise in defence spending and warned that without it, the effectiveness of the Armed Forces would inevitably deteriorate further. He told the Lords that militant jihadism was the biggest threat to the ‘free world today’, adding: ‘Are our Armed Forces in a fit state to play their role in dealing with these and other risks to our way of life? … The answer must be that it’s not good enough but it’s some consolation that it’s better than any other allied nation except the US.’ Another senior police officer backed Miss Dick’s remarks. Sir Peter Fahy, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, said a lot of extremists were radicalised ‘in their own community’. He said propaganda videos of Syria made the conflict look like a ‘Boy Scout camp’ when the reality was ‘very brutal, very callous’. ‘We mustn’t over-emphasise the power of the internet,’ he said. ‘We know that a lot of people have been radicalised in their own community by people who themselves have given this very perverted message.’ He added that police needed the ‘whole of the community to counter this narrative’. 'Brutal': Sir Peter Fahy, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester said propaganda videos of Syria made the conflict look like a 'Boy Scout camp' when the reality was 'very brutal, very callous' The Government’s former counter-terror adviser Lord Carlile called for ministers to bring back powers used to control terror suspects, which were watered down after pressure from Nick Clegg. He said it was impossible for police and security services to follow jihadis returning to Britain from Syria or Iraq  and said ministers were wrong to ‘abandon’ control orders which had protected the public. Miss Dick, who leaves her role tomorrow, made her comments in an address to the Royal United Services Institute think-tank. She . said there is less ‘alertness’ among British Muslims about extremism . compared with those in other countries. But she said violent images from . Syria and Iraq were forcing them to confront the problem. Police . were using the conflicts to try to convince families and friends to . turn in loved ones if they suspect them of extremist activities . Damning: Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, chief of the defence staff until last year, said the military was 'not good enough' to deal with the global threat from jihadis . She said: ‘In the UK we want to depend more on families, schools, friends, health professionals, employers, observing changes in behaviour and having the confidence to come forward. We do have frequent examples of this, but also many examples of warning signs being missed, ignored or not being brought to the attention of the authorities.’ Miss Dick added: ‘In the UK, it will be communities that defeat terrorism and it remains our greatest challenge to support the development of communities that are wholly hostile to violent extremism and to identify, support and protect those who are vulnerable to radicalisation.’ But she said that communities also need to ‘stand up to them and reject them’, adding: ‘The daily awful news stories underline the scale of the challenge and are, I believe, reducing complacency and passivity.’","Police chief says 'warning signs' not brought to attention of authorities .

"Damien Hirst's Diamond skull. The multi-millionaire is one of Britain's wealthiest artists . You could hear the champagne corks popping all over London this week when the Tate Modern art gallery in London announced the biggest corporate sponsorship deal it has ever struck: at least £5m over the next 11 years. Their benefactor is the South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai and you can see why the industry giant might want to forge links with Tate. Tate Modern gets more visitors than any other modern art gallery in the world: a whopping 4.7 million last year. It also has what must surely be the most magnificent spectacle any gallery has to offer: the view from the north-facing windows across the Thames to the majesty of St Paul’s cathedral. Shame about the stuff inside. Actually, that’s not entirely fair. There is plenty of good stuff inside. But there is also a great deal of pretentious rubbish and the clue to why that is so lies partly in the gallery’s name. There’s a crucial distinction between ‘modern’ and ‘contemporary’ art. Modern art dates back to around 1870 and the decades that followed gave us Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet, Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Cezanne and, of course, Pablo Picasso in Spain. Contemporary art has given us such figures as Damien Hirst (he of the diamond-encrusted skull and pickled shark) and Tracy Emin and the Chapman Brothers. It may seem unfair to compare them to some of the greatest artists who ever lived, but that is what we are invited to do by galleries like the Tate, which hang their works alongside one another. Most of us know precious little about what makes an artist great. We can, of course, employ the ‘Dunno nuffin’ about art but I know what I like’ formula — or we can put our faith in the experts. Surely if art galleries around the country are stuffed to the gunwales with the work of a handful of artists whose work sells for vast amounts of money, that must prove something? Well, yes, but maybe not what you’d think. Or hope. The BBC’s brilliant arts editor Will Gompertz, who was the director of Tate Media in a previous incarnation, has long been sceptical of the value of much that passes for contemporary art. So he did something very simple — and immensely revealing. He phoned the owners and directors of modern art galleries and, promising anonymity, asked how many of the artworks on their walls they thought had no right being there. They said at least a quarter of them. So why did they put them there in the first place? Because there is a serious conflict of interest in the art world that leads to what ceramicist Grayson Perry — himself one of our most accomplished artists, though often better known for his cross-dressing than his pots — describes as a ‘conspiracy of silence’. Its root cause is that public museums and galleries around the world feel they have an obligation to show the work of so-called ‘brand name’ contemporary artists, but they struggle to survive financially. So a deal is struck. Hirst poses in front of his artwork entitled 'The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living' in the Tate Modern art gallery in April 2012 . Art dealers are more than happy to give a top museum a cut-price bargain on one of their artists because they know that if their work is shown in a major public collection it can hugely increases the value of the work. And if the dealer can’t quite afford to sell at such a low price he might solicit a contribution from one of his rich clients, who also just happens to collect work by the very artist in question. And there’s another link in this chain of self interest. This wealthy individual might also be on the board of the gallery or museum, or a member of one of its many fundraising groups. The collector, like the dealer, stands to gain from an increase in the value of the artist’s work now that he or she is represented in a major collection. So everyone’s a winner. Except you and me of course. If the curators shower praise on ‘their’ artists’ work — even if some of it is palpably rubbish — how are we meant to know that they are effectively compromised? 'If the curators shower praise on ‘their’ artists’ work - even if some of it is palpably rubbish - how are we . meant to know that they are effectively compromised?' As Will told me, if they question the quality of an artist once he or she is represented in the institution’s collection, they risk alienating the wealthy collectors and patrons and even the art dealer who might well represent other artists the museum would like to collect. The upshot is that any public debate about the quality of an artist’s work — such as you expect in theatre, music or literature — is quashed because of compromises and conflicts of interest. As to the intrinsic quality of contemporary art and, God help us, ‘conceptual’ art, where the ‘idea’ behind the work is more important than the way it looks . . . well, here I’m fortunate enough to have my own vast experience to draw on. Two weeks at Chelsea College of Art and Design to be precise. Eight years ago I was foolish enough to take part in a BBC2 programme called Art School. For ten nights the cameras watched me and four other ‘celebrities’ being taught to become artists. I agreed to appear because I can’t draw, can’t paint and if I’m given a lump of clay to mould I end up producing something that looks exactly like a lump of clay. It hurts. I hated it when my children asked me to draw a dinosaur, then wondered why I’d drawn a dustbin with legs. I thought it unlikely that after a fortnight I’d sketch like Leonardo or paint like Rembrandt,  but I did expect to learn something. And indeed I did. I learned most conceptual art is banal, pretentious rubbish without merit or meaning. It does not become art because the ‘artist’ says so. Perhaps my biggest mistake was expecting to be taught technique. Every time I bleated at the teachers about it they’d give me rather pitying looks and suggest that other things are far more important. It’s true that an artist with skill but nothing to say is not a true artist. But if you don’t have the basic skill you can’t say anything. The rot set in more than 40 years ago. Richard Philp, an old friend of mine who’s now a distinguished dealer in antiquities, was a student at the Cardiff School of Art. Shortly after he left in the late Sixties, the word went out to art colleges around the land that traditional teaching was passe. Modern artist Tracey Emin's 'To Meet My Past' Four poster bed . A generation later one of our leading sculptors, Michael Sandle, said: ‘I don’t teach my students how to draw any more; it’s likely to ruin their career’. So if not the basic skills, then what? Experimentation. Ulrika Jonsson and I spent an afternoon in Chelsea messing about on a bed. I’d better explain. Our ‘project’ was to take an old mattress, a scruffy wig, a water melon and a set of kitchen knives and turn them into a work of art. I had a bit of fun stabbing the mattress with a knife and Ulrika stuffed bits of hair through the holes. It was hilarious nonsense, of course, but not according to the critic and curator Sacha Craddock, who was wheeled out every afternoon to appraise our work. She informed us that we had brought out its ‘mattressiness’. I promise that was her word. Thanks to the efforts of Ulrika and me, it had become a work of art. I’m not suggesting for a moment that you can make good art only by applying paint to canvas or a chisel to a block of marble. Of course artists must experiment with new materials and new techniques. In his early years Damien Hirst and many other Young British Artists, as they became known, made many people see art in a different light. But great art must appeal to our hearts as well as our heads. As for my own artistic tastes, when asked to choose the one artist I’d like to have hanging on my walls I’d plump for JMW Turner, which is a bit ironic in a way because he was, in his time, seen as something of an iconoclast. You can imagine his stuffier critics ridiculing some of his later works in which, instead of painting recognisable figures or solid objects, he would create an impression of what he saw. ‘Pah! Nothing but a charlatan,’ they might have fulminated. ‘Can’t make out a bally thing! Just a splodge of paint!’ What his admirers recognised was that he was painting the effects of light. In one of his most famous works, ‘The Fighting Temeraire’, the old warship is exquisitely portrayed in all its fine detail. But a few years later, when he painted a locomotive roaring towards him in ‘Rain, Steam and Speed’, you can barely recognise any solid objects. You don’t need to. The beauty and power of the painting makes you feel you’ve been hit by the steam train itself. It leaves you gasping. You wonder how he did it. It may be a truism, but one test of a great artist is surely whether his art survives. Turner not only survives in his own works but in the influence he had on other great artists — Claude Monet in particular and the Impressionist movement that succeeded him. The great British artist Francis Bacon, famous for his trios of contorted figures, said art must speak ‘directly to the senses’. The only sense most contemporary art speaks to is the sense of ridicule.","Tate Modern this week announced £5m sponsorship over the next 11 years .

"This is the moment a suspected Irish bomber blew himself up after it was believed that he forgot about the clocks going forward an hour for British Summer Time. Police are investigating whether the man, who was allegedly seen running from the scene covered in blood, had injured himself in the blast because he had got his timings wrong when the clocks changed. Officers suspect the bomber planted an explosive device under a Volvo SUV in the centre of Dublin and that it had either gone off too early, or he had returned to the car to investigate why it had not detonated. Blast: An Irish bomber blew himself up after it was believed he forgot about the clocks going forward an hour for British Summer Time . Police believe the high-grade explosives then went off in his face, leaving him with injuries to his head and upper body. Witnesses said they saw a man running from the scene at around 11pm on Sunday with blood on his face, before he climbed into a taxi. 'This certainly was a high-grade explosive used in this bomb. It wasn’t garbage stuff,' a police source told the Daily Mirror. 'It would appear the bomber got his timings wrong.' The source added that the bomber may not have realised just how powerful the explosives were, and that had anyone been in or close to the car at the time of the blast they could have been killed. Probe: Police are investigating whether the man had injured himself in the blast because he had got his timings wrong due to the clocks changing . The car, belonging to a local businessman, was destroyed in the explosion, and the doors and windows of a nearby house were blown out. The Army's bomb squad was deployed to the site of the explosion, close to St Patrick's Cathedral. Police do not believe the attack was linked to paramilitary activity, but instead involved criminal gangs.

"The BBC is managed by a group of men and women who are brilliant at three things. The first — and easily the most important — is persuading their superiors their job is vital to the well-being of the Corporation even if no one is quite sure what that job actually is. The title offers little help. The grander it is, the less it means — but it will almost certainly contain the words ‘strategic’, ‘governance’ or ‘director’. Preferably all three. Parodying Auntie: Hugh Bonnevile and the cast of W1A, which BBC veteran John Humphrys has lauded . Their second is avoiding taking any  decision for which they can be held responsible. They do this by surrounding themselves with clever young people who do all the work and get all the blame when something goes wrong. If it goes right, naturally the director takes the credit. And their third is to demonstrate by thought, word and deed their unswerving loyalty to the man at the top of the organisation: Baron Hall of Birkenhead. John Humphrys, presenter for the Today programme on Radio 4, believes the BBC has always been over-managed . Not that he is ever accorded that title. He is referred to only as ‘Tony’, the better to give the impression they are the closest of friends and Tony hangs on their every word. Their principal activity is holding endless meetings at which nothing is  decided, but a great deal of time  and coffee are consumed and an even greater deal of management jargon is spoken. The more opaque and meaningless the jargon the better. That way, accountability can be avoided and responsibility ducked. If no one really understands what the hell is going on, no one can be held to account for anything. Their contact with the real world beyond London W1A is limited, if not non-existent. Now at this point dear reader (or should I address you as ‘dear licence-fee payer’?), you’ll be wondering why I, as a more or less loyal servant of the BBC, have decided to sign my professional death warrant with such a savage attack on the organisation that has provided me with a pretty decent living for nigh on 45 years. The answer, as you may have guessed, is that the BBC I have described is a fictional organisation. It is the creation of some clever scriptwriters for a new BBC2 comedy series beginning tonight and starring Hugh Bonneville as Ian Fletcher,  ‘Head of Values’ at the BBC. The last time we saw Fletcher was in Twenty Twelve — that wicked satire on the people who brought us the Olympics. This sequel is very funny, too, unless you are a BBC boss in real life. In which case you might, perhaps, worry that your critics will view it more as fact than fiction. You might also worry how the more humble mortals who work for the BBC, and have never risen through the ranks to breath the intoxicating air of the senior management corridors, will view it. I’d be lying if I said there weren’t some of my colleagues who will be punching the air the morning after the programme is broadcast and shouting: ‘Spot on! They’ve got the bosses bang to rights!’ It would be odd if they didn’t. Humphrys (pictured) believes that the BBC is no different from any organisation, arguing that many corporations have too many bosses and staff that think higher-ups are too overpaid . I doubt there is a large organisation anywhere in the world where senior management is loved by all (or even most) of its workers. Or where the workers do not think there are too many overpaid bosses. Why should the BBC be any different? I am on record as saying the BBC is over-managed. It always has been. When I joined the BBC in the Sixties, I was told my patch would be the North-West of England and was ordered to set up my base in Liverpool. I was to work out of Castle Chambers, an office building in the heart of the city, where the North-West Representative of the BBC was based. The Representative (I can never think of him without the capital letter) was a dapper little fellow called Reg. But only to his closest friends. To young pond life like me, he was Major HRV Jordan Retd, JP, BA (Hon) and he was a very grand figure indeed. Reg had an extremely large office with a well-stocked cocktail cabinet and two elegant young secretaries. Not one, you will note, but two. Their duties, it is fair to say, were not onerous. 'W1A' cast: (Left to Right) Simon Harwood (Jason Watkins), Siobhan Sharpe (Jessica Hynes), Tracey Pritchard (Monica Dolan), Ian Fletcher (Hugh Bonnevile), Will Humphries (Hugh Skinner), Lucy Freeman (Nina Sosanya), Anna Rampton (Sarah Parish) Reg graced the office a couple of times a week to sign a few letters and occasionally drove up the coast to Blackpool for lunch with ‘my friend, the Mayor of Blackpool’ in his large plum- coloured Jaguar and white cotton driving gloves before returning to his home in the Wirral. Perhaps Reg’s relationship with His Honour and one or two other municipal worthies in the North-West was, as he insisted, invaluable to the well-being of the BBC. Whether it repaid the considerable sum forked out by the unwitting licence-payer is debatable. And he was not alone. There were many of them here and abroad. Our Representative in the United States, where I was later sent to open a television news bureau, had a far grander suite of offices in New York and an apartment in the UN Plaza with stunning views over the East River that would not have disgraced a Saudi prince. All that was more than 30 years ago. The Representatives have long since been given their marching orders and many similar anachronistic posts abolished — not, it must be said, without a fight. The grand offices have gone, too. Even some of the most senior bosses in New Broadcasting House must slum it with the rest of us. But there are still plenty of places to hold meetings and Lord knows they are kept occupied. The BBC bureaucracy is alive and kicking. And it’s not just me saying that. It’s Tony Hall, too. One of the first trips he made when he became Director General was to the U.S. to see the Google and Apple operations. Back in London, he wrote this: ‘To launch an initiative, one of our colleagues had to speak to two people at Google. ‘To get agreement to do the BBC’s first eBook, someone at the BBC had to speak to more than two dozen.’ There’s not a programme-maker in the BBC who wouldn’t say Amen! to that. Back in the Eighties, I returned from filming a famine in East Africa with some powerful material. I rang the office of the controller of BBC1, Michael Grade, and asked his secretary if he could find the time to look at it because I thought it would make a decent documentary. Half an hour later, I was sitting in Grade’s office. He put his feet on the desk and watched the first ten minutes.‘OK,’ he said. ‘I’ll get it scheduled for a few weeks’ time.’ And so it was. That same process 30 years later would take many months and almost as many meetings as Eisenhower held to plan the D-Day landings. Mercifully, Hall wants to change that. He says the BBC’s meeting culture ‘hampers creativity’. He wants to halve the number of pan-BBC boards and steering groups — a ‘bonfire of the boards’, in his words — to speed up decision-making and ‘release some of the resources wasted on bureaucracy for programmes.’ Anyone who thinks it will happen overnight does not know the BBC. Yet tonight’s programme is an encouraging sign. An organisation that can take the mickey out of its own management quite so ruthlessly shows it’s got the message. And that’s a start.","Humphrys argues that the BBC is over-managed, and always has been .

"A teacher has admitted to having sex with a cheerleader after she was confronted with naked photos she had sent him, authorities have said. Ashley Elizabeth Zehnder, a 24-year-old biology teacher at Pasadena High School in Houston, Texas, has been charged with having an improper relationship with a student. Zehnder met the 17-year-old student, who was a member of the cheer squad, while she worked as assistant cheer coach, according to court documents. The investigation began when Zehnder went to school officials and complained about a naked picture that was being swapped among students, KTRK reported. Accused: Biology teacher Ashley Zehnder, pictured in court, allegedly had sex with a 17-year-old student . 'Secret life': Zehnder, pictured with her  boyfriend, allegedly started the relationship with the student in May . Officials at Pasadena Independent School District began investigating on October 1 and when staff asked the boy how he got the image, he admitted she had sent it to him through Snapchat. He also admitted to staff that they had been in a sexual relationship since May 2014, KHOU reported. Prosecutors say Zehnder, who has a boyfriend, had a sexual relationship with the student throughout the entire summer, KTRK reported. Zehnder initially denied the relationship, but when confronted with the photograph, she admitted that she had sent the naked photo to the teenager through Snapchat. Prosecutors say she had sex with the student for the entire summer, KTRK reported. Claims: Zehnder, left with her boyfriend and right, resigned from the school earlier this month after being confronted with naked photos she had allegedly sent the student using Snapchat . Scene: She taught biology and worked as assistant cheer coach as Pasadena High School in Texas . She resigned from her position on October 9. 'These charges are very serious and this behavior will not be tolerated in Pasadena ISD,' the district said in a statement. 'When an educator violates the trust of a student, it makes it difficult for the majority of teachers who genuinely care for the safety and well-being of students.' Zehnder has since been charged with an improper relationship with a student, a second-degree felony charge, and is out of jail after posting a $10,000 bond. According to her Facebook page, she is in a long-term relationship.","Ashley Zehnder, a biology teacher and assistant cheer coach, 'had a months-long sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student on the cheer squad'

"Top Gear stars used a car number plate for ten days after being warned that furious Argentinians believed it was an offensive reference to the Falklands War, the show’s producer has confirmed. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson was sent a tweet on September 19 from an Argentinian car website claiming the numberplate on his Porsche, H982 FKL, was chosen as a reminder of the 1982 conflict in the Falklands between Britain and Argentina. The show’s producer Andy Wilman confirmed Clarkson read the tweet but said the crew did not change the licence plate until September 30. Scroll down for video . The Porsche 928GT had a licence plate that read 'H982 FKL', which locals believed was in reference to the Falklands War . On a blog post about the incident, Mr Wilman wrote: ‘The first time we realised the plate could be a problem was on the third night of our shoot in Argentina, when Jeremy was scrolling through Twitter and spotted a comment on one of the auto fan sites next to a photo of the plate. I remember his surprise and concern.’ The post then explains that the team spoke to officials in Ushuaia and agreed the plates would be removed when they arrived there in ten days’ time. The tweet to Clarkson was sent by Autoblog Argentina, which had a picture of the car with the phrase ‘1982 Falklands?’ It was followed up with a further 14 tweets written in Spanish complaining about the car. Despite this, the crew continued with the number plate and drove around areas of Argentina including Calafate and Tierra del Fuego. When they reached Ushuaia on September 30 the plate was changed. However by then animosity had reached boiling point and the crew were forced to flee a baying mob. Writing in The Sun yesterday, Clarkson said: ‘I didn’t see the car until I arrived in Argentina. Did I notice the plate? Not until three days later. Jeremy Clarkson (pictured left) has said he didn't see the car until he arrived in Argentina . Police in Tolhuin, Argentina, also found matching 'BE11 END' number plates (pictured) in the Porsche . ‘Our producer immediately contacted local government to ask if it would be a problem when we arrived in Ushuaia, a city from which the doomed warship Belgrano sailed. They said yes and that we should change it before entering the city.’ When contacted by The Mail on Sunday last night, Mr Wilman said: ‘We decided to keep the number plate on until Ushuaia because taking it off would have been illegal. Once we arrived in Ushuaia we took it off as that is where the war issues are most sensitive, and replaced it with one sent over from the UK.’ Jeremy Clarkson and fellow presenters Richard Hammond (left) and James May (right) pictured in Argentina where their convoy was attacked by locals furious over Clarkson's number plate .","Top Gear  used the number plate for 10 days despite warning it was offensive .

"Stuck: Firefighters had to break apart a chimney to extract Genoveva Nunez-Figueroa, 30, who had gotten stuck while trying to break into a home . A woman who was rescued from inside a California home's chimney had recently been dumped by the homeowner, whom she'd met online. Genoveva Nunez-Figueroa had been on a few dates with the occupant, identified only as Lawrence, weeks before she allegedly tried to break into his home. And it wasn't the first time she'd been caught at Lawrence's home. He told KABC she was there two weeks before and she ran off when he threatened to call police. 'It’s actually the second attempt for her trying to access the inside of my house from the roof,' he told CBS LA. 'I'm going to be a little more cautious of who I invite into my house now,' he said, though he didn't specify whether it was property or Lawrence himself that Nunez-Figueroa may have been after in the home. Lawrence said he'd recently ended things with the 28-year-old. Firefighters responded to the scene were forced to take apart the chimney brick by brick and then squirt dish soap inside to free Nunez-Figueroa. Neighbors first heard the sound of a woman crying coming from atop the two-story home early Sunday. When police arrived, they found Nunez-Figueroa still conscious but stuck near the top of the flue. Firefighters used handheld demolition hammers to remove bricks from the chimney in order to get down to where Nunez-Figueroa was trapped. Once they reached her, they poured soap down the chimney to make removal easier, according to Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Captain Mike Lindbery. Up on the rooftop: Genoveva Nunez-Figueroa was rescued from a chimney Sunday. She and the homeowner used to date after meeting online, he told reporters. And he claims she's been on his roof before . Demolition: Using handheld jackhammers, firefighters went to work tearing apart the chimney to free Nunez-Figueroa . Repeat offender: The homeowner claimed that this was not the first time that Nunez-Figueroa had attempted to break in through the roof . 'Chimney flue was lubricated with dish soap prior to hoisting patient,' read the accompanying caption to a photo of the rescue tweeted from Lindbery's account. Nunez-Figueroa was lifted out of the destroyed chimney and taken to the hospital for an evaluation before being arrested for illegal entry and giving false information to a peace officer. 'I’m feeling better, not so weirded out anymore that that person isn’t in my chimney anymore,' the homeowner said. 'Trying to figure out what I’m going to do with my chimney since it’s in pieces but better my chimney than probably me,' he added. Nunez-Figueroa's family has offered to pay the homeowner for his destroyed chimney. Lubrication: Firefighters sprayed liquid dish soap down the flue in order to make it easier to extract Nunez-Figueroa .

"Free: David Bolam (pictured in an undated YouTube video) has been released after being captured by Islamic militants in Libya five months ago . The British teacher held hostage for five months in Libya was released after a ransom was paid to militants, a report claims today. David Bolam, 53, who was principal at the International School in the coastal city of Benghazi, was abducted in May, but it was not reported at the request of the government and his family. A source said his release came after 'negotiations involving local political factions', but BBC News reports that money was handed over to his captors. A ransom demand had been made to the school, according to the report, but it was unclear how much was paid and who raised the cash. Mr Bolam flew back to the UK on Thursday night. His freedom came as Islamic State militants in Syria killed a second British hostage after the UK government refused to pay for their release. A video purporting to show the beheading of taxi driver Alan Henning, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was circulated on the Internet on Friday. Mr Henning was snatched by militants while delivering aid in the IS-occupied city of Al-Dana. His killing came three weeks after a video was published purporting to show the beheading of another British aid worker, David Haines, who was abducted while accessing refugee camps in the north of Syria. Since Mr Henning's murder, his family have accused the government of not doing enough to try to rescue him or otherwise secure his release. In August, a group of rebel militants called Jaysh al-Islam – Army of Islam – issued a video of Mr Bolam, from Craven Arms, Shropshire, appealing to David Cameron to help with his release. Looking haggard and having grown a long beard, he said he had been held for a ‘very long time’ but that his health was ‘good’. He also mentioned a prisoner swap by the United States – most likely referring to the exchange of five Afghan Taliban officials for US soldier Bowe Bergdahl. He stated: ‘I ask the British Government and Prime Minister David Cameron: Please, please, please do the same to allow me to go home, back to my family. ‘And I ask my family and friends and anyone else who hears this: Please can you do something to let the Government understand I need to go home soon. 'Please, please do something to help me.’ Murdered: Allan Henning, left, from was murdered by Islamic State militants this week, three weeks after the murder of David Haines, right. Both had been delivering humanitarian aid to refugees in northern Syria . Since the fall of former Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Benghazi, where the uprising began, has been left a lawless place where Islamist militias do battle with criminal gangs. In 2012, the U.S. envoy to the city was killed when militants stormed the consulate, setting fire to the building, in protest over a film they believed insulted their religion. A former teacher at the International School in Benghazi said most other teachers had left after a 'massive gunfight' near the grounds and the fatal shooting of a colleague. Ged O'Connor Challis told BBC News said Mr Bolam had stayed on when others left because he 'believed in what he was doing.' He called Mr Bolam 'single-minded and stubborn' but added: 'He is a very bright person. He is an English teacher - one of the best I have ever met.'

(File picture) The Foreign Office said in a statement: ‘We are glad that David Bolam is safe and well after his ordeal, and that he has been reunited with his family. 'We have been supporting his family since he was taken. We do not comment on the detail of hostage cases.’ A source told the Telegraph that if a ransom had been paid it could encourage future kidnappings. They added: 'This is not an easy policy to follow - sometimes it is agonising - but it is right.' The Foreign Office was reportedly not involved in the ransom negotiations that secured his release.","David Bolam, head of the International School in Benghazi, snatched in May .

"Though sported Frank Sinatra, button down shirts can draw frowns of disapproval and some even suggest it can dash a chap’s career prospects . At last there’s an answer to the raging style debate that has male fashionistas hot under the collar: just when you can wear a button-down shirt? Though sported by Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra and even 007, in some circles it’s a look that draws frowns of disapproval. Some even suggest it can dash a chap’s career prospects. Now menswear store Burton has laid out the rules in a style guide. Its advice is: ‘DO wear a button-down for a smart/casual look – open-necked or with a thin knitted tie, with dark denim or more formal trousers.’ And holding up the ultimate male style role model as an example, the guide adds: ‘Button-downs can also be worn with a blazer – like Roger Moore did as James Bond.’ It is also permitted to wear the style with a sports coat ‘and with brogues if wearing chinos or even desert boots with a soft-shouldered suit and silk knitted tie’. However, wearing a button-down is not recommended for black tie events or weddings – unless dress is specified as smart-casual – and City workers and aspiring lawyers are advised they might risk their future by wearing such a garment. The guide concludes: ‘Unless you know you can get away with it 100 per cent, don’t take chances.’ The debate may not completely be over yet though. Style guru Peter York, author of The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook, said yesterday that wearing a button-down shirt with a tie in a casual outfit was ‘classic’, adding: ‘It’s a preppy US-look.’ Robert Johnston, style director at GQ magazine disagreed, saying that it made men appear like ‘they have been dressed for school by mother’. ‘If you turned up to work wearing one then you should be sacked.’ He joked: ‘Frank Sinatra could get away with it, but he would look good in a bodybag.’","Menswear store Burton has laid out rules for wearing a button-down shirt .

"Sting: Habibur Rahman, 27, sold our reporter equipment to fit on to card slots and read unsuspecting bank customers' private data . A crook who uses eBay to sell electronic devices that clone bank cards at cashpoints has been unmasked by The Mail on Sunday. Known as skimmers, the matchbox-size machines fit on to card slots to read unsuspecting bank customers' private data, enabling criminals to clone their cards and steal cash in a widespread fraud that costs Britons many millions of pounds each year. Despite being illegal under the Fraud Act 2006, dozens of skimmers have been sold in the UK for prices up to £765 on auction website eBay. Among the sellers was Habibur Rahman, of East London. Contacted by an undercover reporter about buying a skimmer, Rahman, 27, said: '[It's] good money if ur patient and put the time in. It's all about time. 'I have some customers buy these on a regular basis. So they must be doing sumthing right. People who buy it they no what they are doing. It works just need to no the right places to get ur money [sic].' Our reporter bought a panel used with a skimmer to disguise a pinhole camera that records a customer's PIN. The item cost £65 and arrived in the post within days. The Mail on Sunday traced his eBay seller address to a £300,000 three-bedroom terrace house in East Ham, London. There, a man whose photograph is on Facebook under the name Habibur Rahman claimed he had never heard of him. When told about this report, he shouted: 'Get off my property.' Later that day the listings were taken off eBay. An analysis of Rahman's eBay account revealed he has been selling skimming devices for at least six months and has made 42 transactions, including sales of skimmers, skimmer spare parts and camera panels. Trade body The UK Cards Association said skimming was responsible for £43.4 million of fraud last year. Michael Kemp, founder at security consultants Xiphos Research, said: 'This type of equipment used to be extremely difficult to get hold of. What is scary is that it is now openly available to anyone on eBay.' Scroll down for video . The matchbox-size machines fit on to card slots to read unsuspecting bank customers' private data, enabling criminals to clone their cards and steal cash . Home Affairs Select Committee member Nicola Blackwood said: 'It seems to me that offences under the Fraud Act may well have been committed in this case and it is hard to see how card fraud will ever be stamped out while the sale of credit-card skimmers is being facilitated by online retailers in this way.' A spokesman for eBay said: 'We co-operate fully with the police and other authorities to help keep eBay free of any items of concern.' Contacted by email yesterday, Rahman replied: 'Your so dumb, you think anything works. Only to exploit stupid people who think this might work [sic]. In reality nothing ever works and I would like you to be able to show proof that I even sold you this item.'","Habibur Rahman, 27, uses devices that clone bank cards at cashpoints .

"A Royal Navy engineer is sailing to Africa as part of Britain’s ebola task force just days after learning the virus has killed eight members of his family and infected a further six. Christian Blango, 28, from South London, is on a mission to Sierra Leone after hearing that ebola had spread through his family’s village. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Blango turned down an offer of compassionate leave after he told Navy top brass of the deaths. Mercy mission: Christian Blango, 28, from South London, is heading to Sierra Leone after hearing that ebola had spread through his family’s village. The Royal Navy engineer is sailing as part of Britain's ebola task force . Naval airman Blango said: ‘This is personal now and the deaths in my family have made me even more determined to help people suffering with ebola. ‘Even my commander asked me not to go because of my family circumstances but I still wanted to go and help. I am proud to do my part and to contribute to the vital humanitarian work. ‘I was aware of the ebola situation in Sierra Leone but it never occurred to me it would affect my own family. I was prepared to go before I knew that my family was involved but knowing that has made me even more determined. ‘I just want to help, not only because of my family, although that has made me more passionate.’ At sea: RFA Argus is expected to remain in Sierra Leone for six months, where it will deliver food and medical supplies to remote areas of the country . He told his father: ‘Somebody has got to do something about it and I’m very pleased we have decided to provide aid. Sierra Leone does not have the infrastructure needed to cope and it would be a disaster for the country if we didn’t help. It is an honour for me to play a part.’ Blango joined the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) in 2009 after obtaining an engineering degree from the University of Greenwich. He is currently sailing to Sierra Leone aboard British hospital ship RFA Argus. His job on board is to service and maintain three Merlin helicopters which, once the vessel arrives off the coast of the country’s capital Freetown this week, will deliver food and medical supplies to remote areas. Blango was able to speak to his parents from Gibraltar last week while the ship docked to allow vehicles to be driven aboard. He told his father, Columba, that he was in a good mood after being granted shore leave and finding a McDonald’s restaurant near the docks. Last night 58-year-old Columba Blango, a former Mayor of Southwark, in South East London, said: ‘Christian joined the Royal Navy for the purpose of humanity. ‘He loves it and he knows he is doing the right thing now, and he considered it his duty to serve his nation. ‘His mother and I are very proud of him. When we’ve spoken to him we’ve tried not to ask him too much about his ebola mission but he seems very positive about what he’s doing. After the terrible family news I was surprised he was emotionally ready to go but he is and I am encouraging him every step of the way.’ Christian Blango was born and raised in Britain but visited his extended family in Sierra Leone as a 17-year-old. On September 11, three of his cousins living in the village of Moyamba Junction, situated 100 miles east of Freetown, began displaying symptoms of the virus. The following day rescue workers from the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres took swabs which led to them being diagnosed with ebola. They subsequently died. Victims: On September 11, three of Blango's cousins living in the village of Moyamba Junction, situated 100 miles east of Freetown, began displaying symptoms of the virus. Above, health workers in Sierra Leone . Then on September 17, two more cousins were diagnosed and later lost their lives. Since then a further nine of his cousins have contracted ebola. Of these, three have died and six are receiving medical treatment. The 28,000-ton RFA Argus set sail for Sierra Leone ten days ago. Once she arrives, she is likely to spend up to six months there. Last night, the Ministry of Defence declined to comment. More than 10,000 people have been infected with ebola, according to figures released yesterday by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Of those, 4,922 people have died, the WHO said. The ebola epidemic in West Africa is the largest ever outbreak of the disease with a rapidly rising death toll in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There have also been cases in three other West African countries, Spain and the United States. The UN health agency said yesterday the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases has risen to 10,141, with about 200 new cases since the last report, four days ago. But even those figures are likely to be an underestimate, the WHO has warned, as many in the hardest hit countries have been unable, or too frightened, to seek medical care. A shortage of labs capable of handling potentially infected blood samples has also made the virus hard to track. It comes as authorities in Mali confirmed the death of the country’s first ebola patient, a two-year-old girl who had arrived from Guinea. And the governors of New Jersey and New York have ordered a mandatory, 21-day quarantine of all medical workers and other arriving airline passengers who have had contact with victims in West Africa.","Christian Blango is sailing to Africa as part of Britain's ebola task force .

Shabazz Suleman, 18, a pupil at the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe – alma mater of Justice Secretary Chris Grayling – had a place lined up at a leading university after achieving good A-level results this summer. Suleman, nicknamed ‘Bazz’ by friends, had previously travelled to the Syrian border with an aid convoy last summer. Scroll down for video .

Police have accessed computer files at the school relating to Suleman. Authorities are also monitoring social media. A former pupil says Suleman sent him a private message via the Twitter account @KavkazIslamist, writing: ‘I’m in Syria LOL [laugh out loud]. Doing aid work.’ On the same account, Suleman appeared to express support for violence to establish an Islamic state.

It is around the corner from the teenager’s £400,000 detached family home. When approached by this newspaper, Suleman’s mother claimed her son was doing aid work.

"This is a vision of what might be the future of Wimbledon, the world’s greatest tennis tournament which starts tomorrow. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the All England Lawn Tennis Club is planning a multi-million-pound expansion on to the golf course that borders its famous courts. It has been confirmed that the new Wimbledon will incorporate a venue to stage the qualifying tournament for the showpiece Grand Slam  event – these matches are currently played in nearby Roehampton. Courting controversy: In dotted red line, next to the existing tennis site, the boundary of Wimbledon Park Golf Club - and our vision of what the future might hold . Now speculation is mounting that in years to come it will feature a spectacular new show court, a hotel and even a statue of current men’s champion Andy Murray. In an exclusive interview with this newspaper, All England Club chairman Philip Brook revealed the club will expand on to land currently leased out to the neighbouring Wimbledon Park Golf Club. The All England Club bought the freehold of the golf club from Merton Council for £5.2 million in 1993. The golf club’s 800 members – who include former Cabinet Secretary Lord O’Donnell and television presenters Ant and Dec – have been told that the All England Club has rejected pleas for a new lease. The decision is a bitter blow to golf club members who had hoped they would be allowed to keep a nine-hole course. Mr Brook said: ‘When we bought the golf club’s land we had the long term in mind and when the lease runs out, building courts there and moving our qualification event from Roehampton to on-site will make sense. ‘It’s a few years away and we’ve so much to do already with what we are planning at the moment that we are focused on that.’ Facing the boot: Wimbledon Park Golf Club, which has 800 members including Lord O'Donnell and television presenters Ant and Dec is set to close. It is a bitter member for golfers who hoped they would be able to keep the nine-hole course . ‘The only way to stay at the top is to keep working hard to continually improve. It’s that ethos. We look  at our rivals, they look at us. ‘We consider ourselves to be the premier tennis tournament in the world and we want to stay there.’ Sources close to the club say this ambition requires major developments and envisage long-term projects including a new amphitheatre-style show court, more corporate hospitality venues, a shopping village, public catering, picnic areas and a top lakeside restaurant. Dipesh Patel, director at Pattern Architects, who is working on a stadium design for the 2022 football World Cup in Qatar, said: ‘If I were advising Wimbledon, I would tell them that for the new site they should focus on more hospitality including exclusive suites and high-end restaurants. ‘The inclusion of an iconic feature, such as Murray Mound, is also essential. Those are the details that people know around the world and have helped Wimbledon become  the force it is today.’ Money is no object for the tennis club. The Wimbledon tournament generated £37.8 million profits in 2012. The club has predicted it will raise £100 million from debentures alone before 2020. Officially, there is still 27 years before the golf club’s lease expires but there is already talk of the tennis club offering the golfers a sweetener to leave far sooner. A recent letter from the golf club to members said: ‘We should most sensibly assume that our lease will not be renewed in 2041, not even for a nine-hole course.’ Celebrity players: Ant and Dec, pictured before the 2012 Masters at Augusta, frequently use the golf club which looks set to close . One member said: ‘It’s terribly sad to lose a 100-year-old golf club. The council should never have been allowed to sell it [the freehold]. I know we could have bid for it but it was our members’ money being pitted against the might of  the tennis club, and we didn’t have a chance.’ If the All England Club wants to include new permanent structures on the golf course, it will have to upgrade the planning status of the land. ‘That won’t be a serious problem,’ said the golf club member. ‘The tennis club knows how valuable the tournament is to Wimbledon and the council will do all it can to help them. The last time there was a really serious difference of opinion the All England Club threatened to move their whole operation to Basingstoke and the council caved in immediately.’ Tennis fans hoping for an autograph from a Wimbledon star face disappointment after the club built a tunnel so players don’t have to mingle with the public. The tunnel, shown in a plan above, goes from a car park outside the grounds into the players’ lounge. There will be guards at its entrance. Club chairman Philip Brook said: ‘We have built it to protect the privacy of the players. Fans will still be able to get autographs at a designated area.’ The club has not confirmed if the tunnel will be open this week.

"Excited fans of Martin Freeman are being made to delete photos snapped on their mobile phones during his performance of Richard III after falling foul of theatre rules. The acclaimed West End production has attracted people who want to see the Sherlock and Hobbit star in the flesh as the villainous Shakespeare character. Many are first-time visitors to the theatre and they are taking pictures as a souvenir, in defiance of both copyright laws and theatre etiquette. Ban: Hobbit fans who are going to the theatre to see Richard III just so they can take photos of Martin Freeman are being made to delete their photos . Culprits spotted by staff at London’s Trafalgar Studios are made to delete images before they leave the auditorium, while those who aren’t spotted but later post them online have been made to remove them due to copyright infringements. One blogger wrote: ‘A woman two rows ahead of me took pictures of the set before the performance and was immediately noticed by an usher, who told her she had to delete all pictures – and then stood there until she did. Serious business!’ Another theatre-goer was made to pixelate the image she posted. She wrote: ‘The staging and set design are brilliant. Hobbit-mania: Many fans flooding into to see Richard III are believed to be first-time theatre goers there just to see Martin Freeman (above as Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit films) in the flesh . Here’s a definitely illegal photo of the stage, which is now edited to be unrecognisable because I was asked to remove it due to copyright infringement.’ It is not the first time Freeman’s fans have upset the theatre establishment. Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday revealed how they were criticised for applauding the actor without waiting for an interval or the final curtain. Huge hit: Martin Freeman (left) as Dr Watson in hit show Sherlock, alongside Benedict Cumberbatch (right) who plays Sherlock Holmes . One usher told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We have never seen such a big problem. There is a new audience who have not been to the theatre before and don’t know the etiquette. 'Martin Freeman is such a big star that they think it is OK. Audiences are warned when they come in not to take photos, so there is no excuse.’ A production spokesman said: ‘The designers have the copyright to their set designs. 'That, added to the fact that part of the staging is for the enjoyment for new audiences, means that no photography is permitted.’","Acclaimed West End show attracting floods of Hobbit and Sherlock fans .

"It has become the first port of call for cash-strapped families trying to keep down their grocery bills. But shoppers at Aldi in Britain are paying prices almost double those at the discount chain’s European outlets. The retailer has won an increasing share of the UK market with its money-saving offer, but The Mail on Sunday has discovered items including fruit, meat and alcohol cost even less at Aldi abroad. A comparison using a basket of common groceries found that the chain offers far better value in Germany, Spain and France than in Britain. Scroll down for video . A comparison of common groceries found that Aldi offers far better value in Germany, Spain and France than in Britain, with a basket in London costing £44 but just £23 in Marbella, Spain, and £26 in Paris, France . The basket, which included grapes, milk, chicken and wine, came to £44.92 at a store in north-west London. In the Spanish resort of Marbella, the items were valued at £23.13, while in Berlin the goods cost £23.38. At a store in Paris, the bill for the basket was £26.64. The difference in price is all the more surprising because there is no VAT on most foods in Britain, unlike other European countries. However, the UK does pay hefty duty on alcohol compared with our Continental neighbours. The figures also fly in the face of sterling’s current strong position against the Euro. This means that you should actually get more for your pound buying goods from abroad. Aldi markets itself as a bargain place to buy alcohol but our investigation found European stores offer shoppers much better deals on wine, beer and spirits. Six bottles of 330ml beer in England cost £3.99 but Spanish shoppers pay just £1.19. And six larger 500ml bottles cost £1.45 in France and £1.34 in Germany. British shoppers pay £4.99 for a bottle of Bordeaux Superieur red wine, while in Germany a bottle of Bordeaux Chateau Tour St. George costs only £1.97. British shoppers pay £4.99 for some brands of red wine, while in Germany the same bottles cost just £1.97 . In Spain, only one non-national red wine was available – a Rubinello Chianti at £3.15. Meat was also cheaper abroad – a 1.65kg chicken came in at £3.99 in Britain, equivalent to £2.42 per kilo. In Germany a 1.4kg bird is £2.60, or £1.86 per kilo. France charges £1.95 per kilo and it is £1.71 per kilo in Spain. Two pints of semi-skimmed milk in Britain will set you back 79p, which is 39.5p per pint. In Germany two and a half pints cost 51p, or 20.4p per pint. And 2.5 pints cost 55p in France, equal to 22p a pint. In Spain, 1.75 pints is priced at 62p, or 35.4p per pint. Tony Baines, joint managing director of corporate buying at Aldi, said: ‘The difference in grocery prices is not specific to Aldi. We offer our customers the best quality product at the most competitive price. ‘Shoppers know we offer the best value in the UK and won’t be beaten on price. ‘Aldi shoppers can save 30 per cent to 50 per cent on their weekly shop when compared to prices at other UK supermarkets.’","Basket of goods in London cost £44 while same items cost £23 in Marbella .

"Piece of cake: Fans of the show have said Paul Hollywood isn't just interested in Kate Henry's (pictured) delectable desserts . After serving up a succession of perfect pies, it was perhaps inevitable that Kate Henry would win the coveted ‘star baker’ award on last week’s episode of the Great British Bake Off. But according to fans of the hit BBC series, it seems judge Paul Hollywood isn’t just impressed by Kate’s ability to produce faultless flaky pastry and delectable desserts. A number of viewers took to Twitter after Wednesday night’s programme to comment on the flirting between Hollywood and Kate, a furniture restorer from Brighton – and claimed they were more interested in watching the pair making eyes than pies. One Twitter user wrote to Hollywood: ‘We’re watching your little smiles to certain #GBBO contestants, very very very closely – Kate Henry particularly. Watching u.’ Another wrote: ‘The chemistry between Paul and Kate #ooft #GBBO’, while one tweeted: ‘Paul Hollywood mainly wants a bite out of Kate #gbbo’. Other fans claimed the attraction was mutual, suggesting that Kate, a 41-year-old mother-of-one, was flirting too and that viewers could ‘tell by her eyes’. However, it seems that some of the tweets touched a nerve with Hollywood, with one user claiming their account had been ‘blocked’. Hollywood, 48, made headlines last year when he split from his wife Alexandra over his affair with Marcela Valladolid, his co-star on the American version of the TV baking competition. However, Hollywood has since been reunited with Alexandra, and publicly acknowledged that his affair was ‘a big mistake’. Alexandra, 50, also spoke earlier this year of reconciling their marriage: ‘It has been a tough year – it’s really hard when you have your life splashed all over the papers but you’ve got to get on with it and make the best of what it is.’ 'Little smiles': Fans claimed the attraction was mutual, suggesting that Kate, a 41-year-old mother-of-one, was flirting too and that viewers could ‘tell by her eyes’ A number of viewers took to Twitter after Wednesday night’s programme to comment on the flirting between Hollywood and Kate, a furniture restorer from Brighton .","Viewers took to Twitter to comment on the flirting between the pair .

"Sir Cliff Richard, pictured, was interviewed by detectives over a child sex abuse allegation . Sir Cliff Richard was interviewed yesterday by detectives investigating claims that he sexually assaulted a schoolboy at a Christian rally almost three decades ago – and denied the allegation. The veteran star returned to Britain and voluntarily met officers from South Yorkshire Police but was not arrested or charged, said his spokesman. He ‘entered South Yorkshire police premises by arrangement,’ said a statement released by the force, and was interviewed under caution. It is claimed that he assaulted a . youngster under the age of 16 at an event held by American evangelist . Billy Graham at Sheffield United’s Bramall Lane stadium in 1985. The development comes nine days after a controversial raid by police on the 73-year-old’s £3.1 million Berkshire apartment that was broadcast live on the BBC. Last night his spokesman said: ‘Sir Cliff Richard voluntarily met with and was interviewed by members of South Yorkshire Police. He was not arrested or charged. ‘He co-operated fully with officers and answered the questions put to him. Other than restating that this allegation is completely false and that he will continue to co-operate fully with police, it would not be appropriate for Sir Cliff to say anything further at this time.’ Earlier, the police chief leading the investigation into Sir Cliff accused the BBC of a ‘cover-up’ over how its journalists learned the star’s property would be raided. The Corporation has received 762 complaints over its live coverage of the incident. Sir Cliff was furious it was broadcast on TV before he had been spoken to by police. It led to an outcry from fans and MPs. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the claims of a cover-up were a ‘matter of deep concern’. Scroll down for video . Cliff Richard was at his house in Portugal (pictured) when the raid on his UK home took place . He was left furious after the BBC screened the search live while he had been given no prior warning . He has summoned the South Yorkshire chief constable and BBC director general Lord Hall to appear before his committee on September 2. Lord Hall has insisted that BBC journalists ‘acted appropriately’ in their coverage of the story. It emerged last week that Sir Cliff has pulled out of a visit to the US Open tennis championships in New York and turned down the freedom of his adopted Portuguese home town of Albufeira. He also cancelled an appearance at a charity event at Canterbury Cathedral next month because he does not want the event to be ‘overshadowed by the false allegation’. Sir Cliff . reacted with fury earlier this month after learning that police were . searching his £3million apartment in Sunningdale, Berkshire - while the . BBC filmed live - when he had no prior notice. He . was on holiday in Portugal at the time and has since met lawyers in the Algarve before returning to the UK ahead of . yesterday's meeting with police. Since . his arrest, a number of celebrities have come out in support of the . former pop star, while others have criticised the handling of the raid. Cilla Black said in a statement earlier this week: 'Cliff is a very close friend of mine and has been for a million years. Sir Cliff, left, has denied abusing the boy at a Christian rally attended by US preacher Billy Graham, right . 'I, like everyone else, was shocked to hear of these allegations and I am absolutely positive that they are without foundation.' Former BBC journalist Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, has described the investigation as a 'witch-hunt' and attacked the BBC for an 'error of judgment'. The BBC has refused to reveal its source, but says it did not find out from South Yorkshire Police, which carried out the raid. South Yorkshire Police sources have blamed staff working on Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police-led inquiry into historic sexual abuse, for the leak. The police chief leading the case has criticised the BBC over the ‘improper and unauthorised’ way journalists had learned that officers were set to search Sir Cliff’s £3million home. Chief constable David Crompton said he had complained to the BBC about an article on its website stating the force had deliberately attempted to ‘ensure maximum coverage’. He added: ‘This appeared to be an attempt by the BBC to distance itself from what had taken place and cover up the fact that it had initiated contact with the force about the story.’ Sir Cliff Richard, pictured with his friend John McElynn, was staying in Portugal when police raided his home .

"New look: Strictly Come Dancing viewers were not keen on Claudia Winkleman's (left) new hairstyle . For years, her distinctive fringe and heavy eye make-up made Claudia Winkleman instantly recognisable as the presenter of the Strictly Come Dancing spin-off show It Takes Two. So it was hardly surprising that viewers were left reeling when the 42-year-old star appeared to have undergone a dramatic makeover in preparation for her new role on the main programme, replacing Sir Bruce Forsyth as co-presenter alongside Tess Daly. With a new shaggy hairstyle, and a hot pink top and skirt by designer Roland Mouret replacing her traditional black outfits, Claudia provoked a wave of criticism on social media, with some viewers describing her new look as ‘awful’ and others urging her to bring back her ‘sooty eyes and long fringe’. Some viewers even embarked on a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #BringBackClaudiasFringe. One wrote: ‘Claudia Winkleman looks like she’s wearing a towel and didn’t have chance to get ready.’ Another said: ‘Why the hell hasn’t Claudia Winkleman got her eye liner on? It’s the reason I love her!’ And one comment read: ‘Was it just me or did Claudia Winkleman look awful last night? She looked 10 years older.’ However, some welcomed the presenter’s change of appearance. One viewer wrote: ‘I loved Claudia Winkleman’s new look on #StrictlyComeDancing – nice to see her out of black, with less eye make-up and a shorter fringe.’ More than 5.8 million people tuned in on Friday to watch the first competitive show of this year’s series.

"Mother knows best: Georgina Clark whose daughter did not 'run off' with the former deputy headmaster at her school . It is a sex scandal that has rocked one of the country’s leading private girls’ schools and resulted in the resignation of the deputy headmaster accused of having an affair with a former pupil. But now the mother of the girl at the centre of the storm has denied any affair took place and accused The Godolphin and Latymer School of ‘hanging my daughter out to dry’. Speaking for the first time, Georgina Clark told The Mail on Sunday that her 19-year-old daughter Helena Skelly had not had a sexual relationship with married teacher Phil Culling, and said that the teenager had been wrongly portrayed as a Lolita. Mr Culling, 41, was forced to step down last week because of his alleged romance with aspiring singer Helena, who left the school last summer. But her mother insisted that Ruth Mercer, the headmistress of the £17,000-a-year school in Hammersmith, west London, had taken the action because she and the governors were ‘paranoid’ about its image. Parents received an email from Mrs Mercer informing them Mr Culling had ‘resigned his position as deputy head with immediate effect’ because his role had become ‘untenable’. Mrs Mercer had reportedly confronted her deputy about the relationship after being told the pair had moved in together. But Mrs Clark, 52, speaking at her home  in Tadworth, Surrey, denied that there was a relationship, saying: ‘Is my daughter close to Phil Culling? Yes. Has she had a sexual or physical relationship with him? No. ‘The school has hung my daughter out to dry and she has become the centrepiece of all this but there’s no substance to it. ‘It was a parent who rang the school – I don’t know who. But my daughter is innocent and now she is being made out to be some sort of Lolita. Helena Skelly is a talented musician and has aspirations of becoming a singer-songwriter . Helena Skelly was a former pupil at The Godolphin and Latymer School where Phil Culling was the deputy headmaster. The school motto is an ancient Cornish phrase, Francha Leale Toge, which translates as 'free and loyal art thou' ‘I utterly believe my daughter when she says that there is nothing going on between her and Mr Culling. She’s devastated by all this. ‘She’s my child and I just want to protect her – we are very close. Helena would have come to me first, without question, if there was anything going on. It’s an extraordinarily expensive school, and I think the school is so paranoid about profile that it cannot afford a scandal.’ In a further twist, Helena’s former boyfriend said last night he had been told two years ago she had fallen in love with an older man. Lifeguard Josh Rosario, 19, from Hampton, Middlesex, revealed: ‘We dated briefly two years ago for about a month. Things didn’t work out and afterwards a friend told me she had fallen in love with an older man.’ Talented: Helene Skelly left school last summer and has ambitions to become a singer-songwriter . Mr Culling was head of music and became close to Helena after helping her with her goal of becoming  a singer-songwriter. But Mrs Clark insisted that her daughter and Mr Culling had done nothing improper, saying: ‘There has been no inappropriate behaviour between my daughter and Mr Culling in my view. ‘Yes, he was supportive to her at school. Yes, he plays the piano with her when she performs. But he’s not sharing a flat with her, he’s not sleeping with her and I have no idea why he has left his wife now. My little girl is a consenting adult but she has not had an affair with that man.’ Mr Culling is thought to have moved out of the £600,000 four-bedroom home he shared with his wife Rebecca in Isleworth, Middlesex. It is understood that the school decided not to involve the police because the romantic side of the relationship is believed to have taken place after Helena left the school. The headmistress declined to comment last night, but the school has previously confirmed that a teacher had resigned after failing to maintain standards of behaviour expected  of staff.","Helena Skelly, 19, is 'close' to former teacher Phil Culling but not sexually .

"The first photographs of Helena Skelly, 19, and Phil Culling, 41, together . The deputy headmaster and the teenage former pupil whose  affair brought scandal to a leading public school have been seen together for the first time since news of their relationship broke. Phil Culling, 41, went to an acoustic gig where aspiring musician Helena Skelly, 19, was performing. He watched adoringly as she sang about forbidden love. Before Friday night’s show, attended by around 30 fans, the pair shared an intimate kiss. And . throughout her 40-minute set, Mr Culling smiled encouragingly as Miss . Skelly, wearing a short lacy dress and high heels, played guitar and . sang about heartbreak. He passed her drinks and chatted with her . friends . She . told the audience at The Troubadour, in Earls Court, west London that . since the scandal broke, ‘I’ve had to delete all my social media, which . is the worst time to play a gig.’ She . said one song was ‘about wanting relationships to work out but not . knowing how they’re going to go,’ while another  mentioned ‘the love of . my life, but only to borrow.’ After . the performance, she sat on his lap at the venue, which has previously . played host to Bob Dylan, Adele and The Rolling Stones’ Ronnie Wood. Later she smoked cigarettes and chatted to friends while he sat quietly. The pair left at 10.45pm with him carrying her guitar. An onlooker said: ‘At first I thought he was her father but then they kissed. Smokers' paradise: Helena Skelly and Phil Culling (seen far left) outside the Troubadour Club in west London .

She gave him coquettish looks while she sang and it all seemed a bit odd.’ Parents at the £17,000-a-year Godolphin and Latymer School  in Hammersmith last month received an email from headmistress Ruth Mercer, saying that Mr Culling had ‘resigned his position as deputy head with immediate effect’. She added: ‘His position had become untenable. The right thing for him to do was to leave.’ Helena Skelly played an acoustic gig at The Troubadour, in Earls Court, west London, on Friday .

"Chelsea defender Ashley Cole and Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick will not be on the plane to Rio with the rest of the World Cup squad next month, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. England manager Roy Hodgson will announce his World Cup squad tomorrow with a dramatic cull of ageing stars as he turns to youth for this summer’s campaign. Hodgson has chosen a 23-man squad packed with young legs to cope with the soaring temperatures and sweltering humidity of Brazil. The team’s oldest members will be Frank Lampard, 35, and Steven Gerrard, 33. Boys not for Brazil: Chelsea left back Ashley Cole (left) and Red Devil Michael Carrick (right) have been left out of Roy Hodgson's squad for the World Cup this summer . Cole, 33, once seen as one of England’s ‘golden generation’, has struggled to get into Chelsea’s first team this season. He will be replaced by Southampton left-back Luke Shaw, 18, who has garnered critical acclaim for his performances this season and become a multimillion-pound target for Manchester United. Carrick, 32, will be forced to make way for Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, 20, tipped as one of the future stars of the squad. The young ones: Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw have been selected for the England squad . Arsenal pair Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) and Jack Wilshere (right) are both included despite suffering injuries this season .

"When Fiona Bruce’s team of experts on the BBC show Fake or Fortune examined this seascape, they were convinced they  had found a lost masterpiece by John Constable. Delighted owner Gillie Dance was told the painting, Yarmouth Jetty, could be worth as much as £250,000, and a smiling Bruce declared: ‘Well I don’t think that could have gone any better really.’ But boat experts are now challenging the verdict – claiming the experts made a ‘glaring mistake’. The original: Constable's painting of Yarmouth Jetty hangs in the Tate . During the show, Constable specialist Sarah Cove told Bruce: ‘I think there are sufficient things that look like Constable that if I had to come down on one side of the line or the other I would say I do think it is a Constable.’ The painting, which had been stored under a bed for decades, underwent further analysis by Anne Lyles, a former curator at Tate Britain – who said she was ‘convinced it was likely to have been painted by John Constable’. However yachting experts say the boats that the painting depicts were not seen in British waters until almost a century after Constable’s death in 1837. Presenter and the painter: Fiona Bruce (left) was amazed when the Fake or Fortune expert told her the painting could be worth as much as £250,000; John Constable (1776-1837) was a Romantic painter. Born in Suffolk, he is famous for his landscape paintings . Dan Houston, the editor of Classic Boat magazine, pointed out that three of the watercraft have a sail and mast arrangement known as a Bermudan rig, first tested in these seas in the 1920s. The boat in the middle of the picture also looks like a J class from the 1930s because of its ‘spoon bow’ hull, he added. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘I don’t think that Constable was blessed with exceptional foresight. It seemed as if the BBC was intent on proving this was a Constable, regardless of the facts.’ And Jamie Campbell, an historian at the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club in Lowestoft, said: ‘Not only was the rig wrong but the sail colour wasn’t authentic either. The picture may be technically correct as a painting but I fear the content just isn’t right.’ A Fake or Fortune spokesman said: ‘This information is part of a larger story which we will consider including in future episodes.’","Painting stored under a bed for decades analysed by Tate Modern expert .

"It is the part actresses have been clamouring for since the BBC announced the remake of its classic bodice-ripper series Poldark. And today The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the central character of Demelza will be played by 21-year-old Eleanor Tomlinson, who has appeared in Hollywood blockbuster Jack The Giant Slayer and the BBC drama The White Queen. She will follow the late Angharad Rees into the role of the fiery servant who falls in love with Captain Ross Poldark in Winston Graham’s series of classic novels. Eleanor Tomlinson, 21, right, is to follow the late Angharad Rees, left, to play the central character of Demelza in remake of the BBC's classic bodice-ripper series Poldark . Producers have promised that a post-watershed slot will ensure the 18th-Century romantic saga is steamier than the original. The original series ran for 29 episodes from 1975 to 1977 and attracted audiences of up to 15 million when it was screened at 7pm on Sundays. It had such an impact that churches in Cornwall even changed the times of evening services to avoid a clash. Last night Ms Tomlinson told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I will do my utmost to do justice to the spirit of Demelza. Aidan Turner will play the title character of Poldark . She’s such an iconic character, who was so brilliantly played by Angharad, and I will do my very best to try not to disappoint the army of Poldark fans out there. ‘I am conscious of the fact that the original series had a huge following and was tremendously popular.’ Welsh actress Angharad died two years ago, at the age of 63, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. One of the executive producers of the new show, Damien Timmer, added: ‘Demelza is the heart of the story and it is a real coup that she will be played by Eleanor. ‘Angharad Rees made a big impact in that role and people really loved her. But we have gone back to the source material and we believe a new audience will fall in love with Eleanor. Demelza is an incredibly complex character and we needed someone who has the potential to play the character for hopefully many series to come.’ The story follows the fortunes of Poldark, an Army officer who returns home to Cornwall from the American War of Independence to find his former life in tatters. His late father’s estate is in chaos and the love of his life, Elizabeth is engaged to his cousin. Poldark then sets about repairing the family name, but also marries Demelza, the servant girl he has made pregnant. Other key roles have gone to Lark . Rise To Candleford star Ruby Bentall, who will play Poldark’s cousin . Verity, and Icelandic actress Heida Reed, who will portray Elizabeth. Mr . Timmer said: ‘We looked at many actresses but Ruby and Heida stood . apart. Heida plays Elizabeth, who left Poldark for his cousin. It’s a . complex, difficult role and there is something incredibly likeable and . sympathetic about her. ‘Ruby is a true star in the making with a big future and we are very lucky to have such a talented cast.’ Verity: Norma Streader, left, found fame in the 1975 show, she will be replaced by 'rising star' Ruby Bentall . Elizabeth: Jill Townsend, right, was Poldark's great love, a role which will be taken by Silent Witness actress Heida Reed, left . In the original series, Verity was played by Norma Streader and Elizabeth by Jill Townsend, while Robin Ellis was the dashing Poldark. The new eight-part series, due to air next year, will feature Irish film star Aidan Turner in the title role. Winston Graham’s son Andrew said: ‘I am thrilled that producers Mammoth Screen are bringing my father’s novels freshly to life with such authenticity to the original books. We already have a brilliant Ross in Aidan Turner and now we have the two people he loves. I am sure Eleanor as Demelza and Heida as Elizabeth will be perfect. Ruby Bentall is also an excellent actor and is a great choice as Verity.’","Eleanor Tomlinson, 21, is to play the central character of Demelza .

"A payday loan company exposed by The Mail on Sunday last week for targeting hard-up families and locking them into a spiral of debt is also preying on unemployed people. The Cheque Centre, one of Britain’s biggest payday lenders, sends staff to stand outside job centres and tells them to hand out leaflets offering loans with sky-high interest rates. The latest allegations were made by a Cheque Centre whistleblower who contacted  this newspaper after our investigation last week. Easy money: Manager Stephen Hunt holds cash in a separate branch of the loan shop which featured last week . The female employee, who did not want to be named, said: ‘The logic is that if people are at a job centre, they are in receipt of benefit and therefore able to pay back the loan. ‘Our area manager told us that if we wanted to get our figures up, we needed to stand outside the local job centre and hand out leaflets with the promise of a loan of up to £1,000. ‘The way he said it was, ‘‘If you want to up your game then you need to do it. Job centres are what bring the results in.’’ 'I didn’t want to lose my job so I went and did it.’ A Cheque Centre spokesman said: ‘We take any allegations very seriously. Following on from last week’s article, we launched an investigation  which will now be expanded.’ Last night, welfare reform Minister Lord Freud said the payday lender’s behaviour was ‘bordering on the immoral’.

"The shameful tactics used by one of Britain’s biggest payday loan companies can be exposed by The Mail on Sunday today. An undercover investigation into high street chain The Cheque Centre – which claims to be ‘a responsible lender’ – reveals how it preys on vulnerable customers and cash-strapped families, locking them into spiralling debt. Our shocking investigation reveals how: . Scroll down for video . Easy money: Manager Stephen Hunt holds cash in a separate branch of the loan shop which featured last week . An employee tells the reporter about the ruthless conversations some have with clients . The revelations came as the Financial Conduct Authority announced new rules clamping down on the industry. A . Mail on Sunday reporter, posing as a trainee manager, worked in one of . the company’s 496 branches where he secretly filmed staff describing the . firm’s heartless tactics. The . Cheque Centre, which turned over £374 million last year and whose . adverts are fronted by celebrities such as Scottish football manager . Ally McCoist, claims it offers loans for everyday emergencies,. But our investigator watched as a stream of customers, often on benefits, asked to borrow as much money as possible. Demanding: Sophie Grafton, 22, is the company¿s area manager for the South-East of England. She sent out emails last week to Cheque Centre staff at the Hounslow store ordering them to sign up more customers for payday loans . Staff admitted that they knew many of the people would use the cash for drink or gambling. Concerned . about the number of people visiting the branch who smelt of alcohol, . our reporter asked his boss, manager Stephen Hunt, what the company’s . policy was on handing them loans. Hunt replied: ‘That is OK in this . place or we wouldn’t serve half our customers otherwise. Use your . judgment. I’ve never not served anyone.’ Last year the firm promised to clean up its act after staff were seen leafletting benefits claimants, even stopping mums with prams in the street. But our reporter, based at the Hounslow branch in West London, observed staff canvassing the high street. One worker admitted during a previous sales drives they had been ordered to target council estates. He said: ‘When I was training we had a map. So you get a particular area where we would give leaflets to – blocks of flats.’ The controversial company also came under fire last year after it chased a desperate father-of-two for repayments and even took money from his bank account as he lay in hospital after a failed suicide attempt prompted by his mounting debts. Our investigator filmed as one member of staff explained how this ruthless practice, known as ‘swiping’, works. The technique is allowed as long as the salesman has got the customer to sign a continuous payment authority, giving the company power over their bank account. The salesman boasted: ‘Say the loan is £220 and they’ve only got £50 in their account. We’ll take that. Consequently you’ll get customers coming in and saying, “You’ve taken this much out of my account and I’ve got to feed my kids.” ’ His reply? ‘Sorry madam, this is our right. You shouldn’t have taken a loan, should you?’ The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby weighed into the paydoay loans controversy last year, promising the Church of England would try to help borrowers itself. Politicians and regulators have sworn to clamp down on the sector and on Friday the Financial Conduct Authority published ‘get tough’ rules. CHAIN: The company turned over £374million last year and claims to be a responsible lender that is dedicated to helping people in financial difficulties . Customers can borrow a maximum of £1,000 for 30 days at a rate of £29.99 for every £100 borrowed. If they borrow £1,000, they will owe £299.90 at the end of the month. If the customer cannot repay in full they are encouraged to pay the interest and roll the loan over. The following month they do the same, so each month they pay almost £300 in additional fees. The annual percentage rate (APR) is 3,873 per cent. The regulations, which come into . effect on April 1, will require lenders to make proper checks that . borrowers can afford the loans; limit how often loans can be ‘rolled . over’ to just two; limit the use of the continuous payment authorities . and require lenders to help customers who can’t repay to find free . advice services. Our . investigator found rolling over debts was rife at The Cheque Centre. On . Thursday, the day before dozens of loans were due to be repaid, the . store received £23,000 for customers it expected to roll over their . debt. Hunt said: ‘We’ve just had £23,000 delivered today. The way they (the company) look at it is we’ve got 48 people who are going to pay all their loans off then they’ll all be back again to reloan.’ On several occasions our reporter observed customers being offered rollover loans, even if they had defaulted. Some had been borrowing for as long as 18 months and had received more than a dozen consecutive loans. The reporter watched people on benefits being given approvals in minutes. Even if they failed the credit check they were encouraged to sell or pawn gold and mobile phones for cash instead. Hunt told our reporter: ‘If a customer comes in and the loan declines, you say, “Well do you have any unwanted gold or phones? You don’t need no credit rating for  that.” ’ The company then offers paltry prices for valuable goods . Worker Kyle Alawooja said: ‘For an iPhone 4s they (the company) will take £20. You’ll find customers are so desperate they’ll take it. You would be surprised. ‘The question is how did they get it? Is it really theirs or have they stolen it? A lot of the customers, I’ve thought, “That’s not their phone they’ve stolen it.” But you’ve got no way of proving it.’ Staff are under huge pressure to sell loans. Sophie Grafton is area manager for south-east England. The 22-year-old pressured staff to drum up business last week, demanding they improve the amount of loans they were issuing. One email to the Hounslow store said: ‘Still on zero?! Change this now please!’ Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has led the campaign for payday loan companies to have tough restrictions, said: ‘What The Mail on Sunday’s investigation has found doesn’t surprise me because I’ve been warning about the techniques of these companies for years. ‘Once you are on their list you are absolutely hunted down and squeezed dry. These practices are completely unacceptable. This is an industry which is full of bad practise. The conduct of these companies is beyond the pale.’ Last night a spokesman for The Cheque Centre said it was investigating The Mail on Sunday’s findings. They added: ‘Our focus has to be on treating our customers fairly and lending responsibly. If it were found that a small number of individuals are not following the strict policies and processes in place to protect our customers, then that is something we would immediately address.’ Victims of The Cheque Centre have told of their misery in a series of harrowing posts online.

"Nazir Afzal, of the Crown Prosecution Service, has defended taking celebrities to trial over historic sex abuse claims . The chief Crown prosecutor who put Coronation Street actor William Roache in the dock over historic sex abuse claims has hit back at critics who accuse him of mounting a ‘witch-hunt’ against celebrities. Nazir Afzal used the example of an investigation into Jimmy Savile, which took place in 2008, while he was still alive, and was not brought to trial, to justify putting Roache, 81, through four weeks in the dock. He insisted he had no regrets and would continue to bring cases regardless ‘of who makes the complaint or who the complaint is against’. Mr Afzal, head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the North West and the national leader on sexual exploitation of children, declined to comment on the Roache case after it ended in unanimous acquittals earlier this month. But he told delegates at a Barnardo’s conference in Manchester: ‘I recognise that I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t. Everybody now accepts the decisions taken back in 2008 over Jimmy Savile, for example, were wrong. We were the first to accept that in 2012. ‘But if we’d prosecuted in 2008 and the jury had acquitted, would people be saying, “You shouldn’t have brought those cases”?’ The prosecutor acknowledged that he had been hurt by the wave of criticism directed both at him and the CPS as a whole. ‘I’ve been called the Witchfinder General, the Celebrity Hunter and a host of other names. But criminal justice is not a ducking stool. It’s due process: proper, thorough investigation followed by a prosecutor review, continuing review and the testing of witnesses in acourtroom.’ Mr Afzal steered away from actually naming the Coronation Street actor, merely telling delegates: . ‘There was a case last week in which a man went to trial innocent and left that trial innocent.’ Later in his speech he asked: ‘Do you all know the case I’m talking about?’ There were murmurs of assent among the delegates. The prosecutor suggested that, rather than being a disaster,  the Roache case had actually demonstrated the inherent fairness of Britain’s jury system. ‘I would not want to live in a country in which  everybody charged with an offence is convicted of that offence,’ he said. Tried: Former Coronation Street actor William Roache (left), 81, and former BBC presenter Stuart Hall, 84 . Afzal said he approached the Roache case ‘like any other’. ‘What mattered were the allegations and the evidence and nothing else,’ he insisted. He went on to say: ‘It seems to have been overlooked by many that the trial judge, independent of prosecution and defence, decided that there was sufficient evidence for the case to progress.’ The criticism of Afzal is in stark contrast to the praise that has been heaped upon him in the past. Both the Prime Minister and the Attorney General commended him for his decision to prosecute the Rochdale grooming gangs when others had baulked at doing so. And his pursuit of Stuart Hall was so thorough the entertainer eventually had no option but to plead guilty to a series of historic sex attacks on girls as young as nine.","Nazir Afzal used 2008 Jimmy Savile investigation, when he was not brought to trial, to justify putting William Roache through four weeks in the dock .

"Being expelled from school is not usually a cause for celebration. But when these two public school runaways were told their places at £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College were ‘untenable’ they gave each other a high-five. Edward Bunyan, 16, and Indira Gainiyeva, 17, attracted headlines worldwide after fleeing their Jesuit Catholic school in cold and wet Lancashire to the sunny Dominican Republic. High five! Edward Bunyan, 16, and Indira Gainiyeva, 17, are pictured sharing a high five together on the day they were told they would not be able to return to £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Lancashire . Romance: Edward - who appears to be smoking in the pictures - also leaned in to kiss his girlfriend's neck . Both sets of parents are allowing the pair to stay together, after saying the teenagers are 'madly in love' Another . private school has been lined up for both the teenagers as their . families believe it would be too disruptive to separate them – though it . is thought they will have to sign a ‘good behaviour contract’. The . replacement, Mount St Mary’s College in Sheffield, is expected to give . them a rigorous interview in which they must show they have mended their . ways. A source said: . ‘They will face an exacting interview and the school will want to know . they are serious and  committed about their education at Mount St . Mary’s. ‘They could be . asked to sign a “good behaviour contract” which would mean the school . could expel them if they infringed the school rules in any way.’ Laurence . McKell, head teacher at the £25,000-a-year college, said: ‘They will . both go through the usual application procedure, an interview, and . we’ll  have to look at their school record  and academic grades before . accepting an application.’ The headmaster of Stonyhurst says he will allow the couple 'one last chance' at education and has arranged interviews for them both at Mount St Mary's College near Sheffield . Edward (second right), was also seen haggling over a scooter with his cousin (second left) Edward then rides away on the back of the bike. The pictures were taken on the same day girlfriend Indira Gainiyeva, 17, and he were told they would not be able to go back to their school . He said he could not comment on whether there would be any ‘specific conditions’ for the two pupils. The young couple fled their 400-year-old boarding school in Clitheroe . on January 13, telling friends they wanted to escape the rain. They were found in the Dominican Republic a week later, sharing an apartment in the resort of Punta Cana. Edward’s . mother, Susannah Bunyan, 56, from Canada, and Indira’s father,  Ravil . Gainiyev from Kazakhstan, flew out to be with them. Last night, they were all said to be  flying out of the country. Andrew . Johnson, head of Stonyhurst, is understood to have asked the parents to . remove their children from the school with immediate effect. He said . the Mount St Mary’s interviews were the teenagers’ ‘last chance to make a . success of their sixth-form education’. Mr Gainiyev, 50, said: ‘I don’t think  we can part them now. If they are together it will be a good motive for them to study.’ The decision came as Indira’s mother Firuza, 44, blamed Britain – as well as young love – for her daughter’s disappearance. Speaking from the family mansion in Kyzylorda, Kazakhstan, she said: ‘There are many shades in this story. For example, how did she manage to leave the country? How did Britain let them go at their age? Why did this other country let them in? ‘I think it was both love and a strict school,’ she added. ‘They ran away, then they got scared, they  are children. Thank God, they can go back to studying. They will get on with their education. ‘I only thank God she is alive and healthy. And I thank God she will be back at school.’ The young couple fled from the 400-year-old Roman Catholic boarding school in Clitheroe in the early hours of January 13, after telling friends they wanted to escape from the rain. They took a taxi to Manchester airport and boarded a plane to the Dominican Republic, where they were found, a week later, staying in an apartment in the resort of Punta Cana. Indira’s father Ravil and Edward’s mother Susannah flew out to be with them and they are all now staying in a five-star all-inclusive resort. The families are expected to fly back within the next few days. Escapade: Indira Gainiyeva, left, and Edward Bunyan, right, are pictured at the five-star beach resort they fled to . In Punta Cana yesterday, Mrs Bunyan declined to comment but Mr Gainiyev was pictured trying to reason with his daughter, who was clearly upset. A relative of Indira said that the girl feared having to return to conservative Kazakhstan after an internet backlash in her home country. The relative said: ‘She told her father, “How can I go back to school, and how can I live anywhere now? I face shame and disgrace. I cannot live calmly in Kazakhstan, everyone will point a finger at me”.’ An official statement released yesterday by Stonyhurst said that Edward and Indira’s parents withdrew their children from the school after long-distance phone discussions with the head about the repercussions of their children’s behaviour. But The Mail on Sunday understands that decision was made after Mr Johnson made it clear to all parties that the pupils’ continued position at Stonyhurst was untenable. Tropical: One of the sandy beaches enjoyed by the runaways . A school insider said: ‘Although they have not been formally expelled, the effect is exactly the same – they won’t be returning  to Stonyhurst. Both pupils have been withdrawn at the headmaster’s request.’ The Mail on Sunday understands that Edward and Indira have been offered interviews at £25,000-a-year boarding school Mount St Mary’s College near Sheffield. Past pupils include Victorian  poet Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Lofting, who wrote the Doctor Dolittle books. Mr Johnson said he helped to arrange the interviews after both pupils had given an account of  their behaviour to their parents,  and apologised. ‘I have spoken to the head there and as a result have secured interviews for both Edward and Indira  at the school. It is now up to them to take it forward,’ he said. ‘They have both said sorry for what they have done and for the distress they have caused and we wouldn’t want to leave them high and dry, no matter what they have done. They have been given a  last chance.’ 'Untenable': The students cannot return to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire . Mr Johnson added: ‘In a way, what has happened has been a lesson to others who might be contemplating the same thing. ‘Pupils may have first thought that this was some kind of exciting adventure, but they soon saw all the trouble that Edward and Indira’s actions have caused. ‘They also saw that sooner or later they had to face the consequences of their actions, which have led to Edward and Indira being unable  to return to school. ‘All of a sudden it no longer looks like such a good idea. That in itself is a very powerful deterrent.’ A member of the Gainiyev family said yesterday that Indira’s wealthy father accepted that his daughter wanted to continue to study with Edward. The relative said: ‘He now wants  to see her at this new school with Eddy, and that both of them can do as well as possible so they can go  on to good universities.’","Indira Gainiyeva, 17, and Edward Bunyan, 16, fled school for five-star holiday in Dominican Republic more than a week ago .

"The 81-year-old actor who was convinced he would be jailed 'on one count or another' Coronation Street star Bill Roache has launched a bitter attack on the judge who presided over his rape trial, accusing him of ‘bias’ and ‘working for the prosecution’. ‘He mauled me,’ said the 81-year-old actor who was convinced he would be jailed ‘on one count or another’ of the two rapes and four indecent assault charges he faced during his 17-day court case. And, extraordinarily, even at the very moment his friends and supporters celebrated his acquittal, Roache believed he was ‘going down’ – as he misheard the jury foreman’s verdict as ‘guilty’ due to a chronic hearing problem. It was only when his burly minder clapped his hands and shouted: ‘Get that man out of the dock!’ did he realise he was a free man. Roache revealed: ‘I didn’t hear the verdict properly, I didn’t hear a couple of “nots”.  I thought I had gone on two [charges] – I just heard guilty, guilty. I really thought they had got me.’ The actor condemned Mr Justice Holroyde for being biased – an accusation supported by his barrister, Louise Blackwell QC, who unusually made two applications to have the jury discharged due to the ‘unfairly biased nature’ of the judge’s summing up. ‘In my view the judge wasn’t impartial. The judge was biased, he mauled me. I thought that was it,’ the star said. ‘My QC was absolutely brilliant. She challenged the judge over his summing up, it was so ridiculous. ‘The judge sent the jury out and my barrister said, “Your summing up is biased”. It was unprecedented. ‘He brought the jury in and I thought he was very different. But in the end, I thought he was still biased. The judge just didn’t like me. ‘Judges, they work for the prosecution, in my opinion. I didn’t realise this.’ His comments were made at a meeting of the Circle Of Love, a spiritualist group of which he has been a member for a number of years. He is pictured attending this meeting with his daughter Verity to the left . Asked about his costs, a jubilant Roache said: ‘I’ll get everything back. When you win, you get everything back.’ His comments were made at a meeting of the Circle Of Love, a spiritualist group of which he has been a member for a number of years. The Mail on Sunday was allowed exclusive access to the group’s meeting in Ashton-under-Lyne near Manchester just hours after the court case ended on Thursday. Relieved but exhausted, the father of four mingled with the congregation and spoke candidly of his ordeal as supporters came up to hug and congratulate him. He told them: ‘I was resigned to going down on one charge  or another. It’s not about truth, or about justice, it’s a game.’ He explained how chronic tinnitus caused him to mistake the jury foreman’s fateful words. ‘My family were weeping and it wasn’t until my security man started clapping and the judge said, “You may leave the dock” that I realised I was a free man. The jury got it right.’ The father of four mingled with the congregation and spoke candidly of his ordeal as supporters came up to hug and congratulate him . It was during a break with tea,  coffee and biscuits that Roache delivered his blistering attack on the trial judge . Asked about when he would return to Coronation Street, Roache said he would be back in August. He said: ‘I’m going in to have a meeting with Granada next week. They’ve said the storylines are written until July. They just can’t fit me in until August because the scripts are so far in advance.’ Asked about whether he would be taking a break, Roache replied: ‘I may pop away for a few days at a spa. I’m taking one day at a time. We’re all right now.’ The actor arrived at the meeting  in a black Range Rover accompanied by his daughter Verity, 31, and her boyfriend. He hugged and kissed members as he stepped into the Seraphina Holistic Centre at Ashton-under-Lyne for the two- hour meeting. The actor arrived at the meeting  in a black Range Rover accompanied by his daughter Verity, 31 . At the start of the candlelit session, a woman strummed a guitar and sang about love, then the group’s 28-year-old leader James Wood  delivered a rambling sermon on love and world peace, before the group held hands and meditated. Roache closed his eyes and bowed his head. As he meditated, one of the speakers encouraged the group to ‘bring love into the room’. It was during a break with tea, coffee and biscuits that Roache delivered his blistering attack on the trial judge. The soap star, who was suspended from Coronation Street while on remand, spent much of the two hours talking intensely to founder member Ann Rogers, who earlier had talked about establishing ‘peace and love on this earth’ so subsequent generations would ‘never know fear’. Roache, the world’s longest-serving soap actor, having played Ken Barlow in Coronation Street since its launch in 1960, had name-checked group leader Mr Wood on the steps of the court after the verdict. He said: ‘I would like to thank James and the Circle Of Love for their love and energy that has brought me to this place and this time, and I look forward to being with them this Friday night.’ The pair shared an emotional reunion at the meeting, as they embraced and James offered words of support to the actor. Mr Wood became a member of the Circle Of Love three years ago, after being introduced to Ann Rogers through a mutual friend. Since  then he has become a close confidant of  Roache. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Mr Wood, of Appleton, near Warrington, Cheshire, said: ‘Bill is a dear friend and I am pleased that  he has drawn support from the  Circle Of Love. ‘I know we’ve been painted in the press as a weird cult, but people find our message difficult to understand, because it’s so simple.’ At the start of the candlelit session, a woman strummed a guitar and sang about love, then the group's leader James Wood  delivered a sermon on love and world peace . Mr Wood explained that the ethos of the cult was to ‘bring peace to the earth through encouraging people to love each other’. Roache was first drawn to spiritualism in the late 1960s when he joined a druid movement, explaining years later that his beliefs helped him cope with the tragic death in 1984 of his 18-month-old daughter Edwina. Two years ago he joined the Circle Of Love, saying he wanted a ‘more spiritual path’. He has attended regular group meetings, even during his time  on remand. Towards the end of the trial, Ms Blackwell drew up a list of 30 points which she said should not have been put before the jury in the summing up, and made an application that the trial should be scrapped. After consideration, Mr Justice Holroyde said: ‘I don’t accept the submission that the content or tone of my summary of the evidence thus far could give rise to any inference of leaning towards the prosecution or against the defence.’","Coronation Street star, 81, was cleared of six charges of sex abuse .

"Stun guns that deliver an electric shock five times more powerful than a police Taser are being sold on eBay, a Mail on Sunday investigation has found. The weapons, which are disguised as torches, paralyse victims instantly and leave them in excruciating pain. In some cases the stun guns have been linked to brain damage and even death. Illegal: This stun gun, bought on eBay by the Mail on Sunday, was advertised as a torch to get round the website's safeguards . For sale: The devices, disguised as torches, were available on eBay - which MPs described as 'extremely concerning' Last night politicians accused eBay of fuelling an alarming new threat on Britain’s streets and of ‘sacrificing public safety in the name of recklessly making profits’. The auction website claims it bans the sale of illegal weapons, but The Mail on Sunday was able to buy three illegal stun guns  and two pepper sprays within  minutes. The packages, bought for as little as £9, arrived days later from Poland, Lithuania, Italy, and America. The stun guns were advertised on the site as ‘Flashlight with electric ring flash’ to get round eBay safeguards that prohibit the use of the terms ‘stun gun’ and ‘Taser’. A reporter handed the weapons to the Metropolitan Police at the London office of The Mail on Sunday. Officers said the force’s firearms unit, SCO19, would launch an investigation into the eBay stun guns, and its 31,000 officers would be briefed about their danger. After this newspaper alerted eBay, the auction site removed the listings from its website. However, just hours later dozens more were back on sale. Tory MP Michael Ellis, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, last night called on the website to review its procedures. He said: ‘It is extremely concerning that eBay is sacrificing public safety by not banning these illegal weapons in the name of recklessly making profits. Danger: The MoS was also able to buy pepper spray from a vendor based in Utah . ‘They are extremely dangerous and, if they fall into the wrong hands, it will be extremely worrying. It’s all very well eBay saying it removes the items as soon as  it finds them, but it is not enough and the company should have more people trawling the site looking for weapons. It’s basic common sense.’ According to the eBay listings, the stun guns are capable of  discharging ten milliamps – five times the amount of controversial Tasers used by police. Ebay retailer Jaroslaw Jagielski, 52, sold us a stun gun online for £19. When approached by a journalist at his home in Zary, Poland, he said he had sold 150 worldwide, with at least ten of them in the UK. He said he had ‘no idea’ that the stun guns were illegal in Britain. ‘I am just a businessman,’ Mr Jagielski said. ‘How should I know what the politicians don’t like in England?’ The other stun guns were bought from Lithuania and Italy while the pepper sprays were bought from eBay shop Xtreme Motors, in Utah, America. Possessing the weapons is a criminal offence under Section 5 of the Firearms Act and anyone caught with one faces up to ten years in prison. Firearms expert Roger Gray inspected the weapons for The Mail on Sunday and said they were ‘sinister and potentially deadly’. Mr Gray, a retired Metropolitan Police sergeant and former tactical adviser for the Met’s firearms unit, said: ‘The eBay listing says they are five times as powerful as Tasers used by the police, but they have been bought online so could be even more dangerous. ‘The fact they are disguised to look like a torch is even more worrying because they could  easily be hidden from police. ‘The pepper sprays are just as bad, and if one of them went off in a crowded Tube carriage it would cause mayhem.’ In 2012, an American Heart Association study documented eight cases of people in the US who have died or suffered significant brain damage following a cardiac arrest linked to being shot with a Taser. Forensic physician Dr Jason Payne-James said: ‘The problem with the sprays bought off eBay is that, although they say that they are pepper sprays, you haven’t got a clue what they actually contain. 'There’s no quality control so it could be anything and it might be toxic.’ In a very severe case, he added, sprays could cause pulmonary oedema – potentially fatal fluid in the lungs. The auction website said it removed illegal products once they were found but admitted it could not guarantee unlawful items would not slip through the net. A spokesman said: ‘We are investigating the cases raised where our control systems did  not prevent sale of the items to a UK address.’ Preventing banned weapons entering the UK is the responsibility of the UK Border Force. A spokesman said: ‘Attempting to possess and smuggle prohibited weapons into the UK is a  serious offence and ignorance of the law is no excuse. ‘Make no mistake – just because it is legal to buy or own an item in another country does not mean it is legal to bring it into the UK.’","Weapons cause excruciating pain, paralysis, and are linked to deaths .

"The ancient villa belonging to Ben Hur’s arch-nemesis, the real life Roman general Messalla, is set to be buried under concrete, under plans to develop a suburb of Rome. Officials in Ciampino outside Rome want to build ten apartment blocks for social housing on the site of the consul’s home, despite evidence that the land contains archaeological treasures dating back two thousand years. Last year archaeologists working in the magnificent villa’s mosaiced baths area found seven seven-foot-tall, complete statues of the Niobids, the children of Niobe and Amphion who were killed by Apollo and Diana— in what would have been an ancient swimming pool. The villa was discovered close to the Via Appia where other ruins, including the Circus Maxentius are also found . The characters were the inspiration for the stories, of the poet Ovid of whom Messalla was patron. Ovid was a guest at the villa, according to historians. Aurelia Lupi, who was working on the dig, said it was ‘the kind of discovery an archaeologist makes once in a lifetime.’ While the discovery of the villa halted the building project, the municipality has asked the regional authority to rescind the construction ban. A decision has yet to be made but under current rules construction could be moved just a few feet away from the villa. The villa has now been placed on the roll call of sites most at risk of being lost to civilisation, the World Monument List. Archaeologists have  warned ‘the growth of the densely populated city of Ciampino is having an impact on the site of old ruins . The authors of the list said the site was ‘a jewel’. They warned ‘the growth of the densely populated city of Ciampino is having an impact on the site, as the municipality plans to build new public housing near the archaeological area’.

"Eleven soldiers, including a two-star general, are being quarantined at a US Army garrison in Italy for 21 days after returning from an Ebola aid mission in Liberia. The troops are  the first wave American military personnel sent to disease-ravaged West Africa and thousands of US service members could potentially face 21 days in isolation before being allowed to return home. Among those being held in quarantine at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza, Italy, is Major General Darryl K Williams, the commander of US Army Africa who personally led the first part of the military's aid mission in Liberia, CBS News reports. Major General Darryl K Williams, the commander of US Army Africa, is among 11 American soldiers being quarantined in Italy after working in Liberia . Providing aid: The US military is building a hospital and several testing stations around Liberia and helping with logistics for health workers in the country . The United States, Britain and France have all sent resources to West Africa to combat the spread of Ebola after the disease infected more than 10,000 people and killed more than 5,000 . It is not yet clear whether all troops who are sent to West Africa will be forced to spend 21 days in quarantine. However, President Barack Obama has committed up to 5,000 military personnel to help stop the spread of the deadly virus, which has sickened more than 10,000 and killed nearly 5,000 people. Today, the CDC updated its policy and recommended only a voluntary quarantine for high-risk Americans returning from West Africa. This comes despite several states, including New York and New Jersey, initially demanding mandatory quarantine for returning health care professionals. The American troops were met by Italian carabinieri military police wearing full hazmat gear as they landed at the Army base in norther Italy - about 45 miles west of Venice, CBS reports. Major General Gary J Volesky, commander of the 101st Airborne Division, is now on the ground in Liberia after assuming command of the growing US military presence in the country on Saturday. A 25-bed hospital for infected health care workers in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, should be fully operational by the first week of November. The facility will be staffed by American doctors and nurses. The military has also set up testing labs across the country. Up to 5,000 US troops will be sent to Liberia to help international doctors and Liberian health officials combat the disease. The military has said they are at low risk of being exposed to Ebola . About 600 US service members are currently on the ground now in Liberia and thousands more have been committed to fight the disease. 'You need our support demonstrated with action not words, and action is exactly what we are going to provide,' Maj Gen Volesky said. One hundred American troops had left from the base in Vicenza to help with logistics of fighting the outbreak in Liberia. They were checked twice a day for any contagion while on assignment. While they were away the mayor of Vincenza, Achille Variati, had requested the Italian government to prevent any contact between the military and the towns people on their return. The mayor had said: 'On their return they must not be contact between the military and the civilian population for three weeks. 'They cannot leave their barracks for all the period of incubation three weeks. To be sure of this the soldiers must be monitored during this period.' Ebola Disaster Assistance Response Team leader Tim Callaghan, CDC epidemiologist Frank Mahoney and  Major General Darryl Williams were on the ground in Liberia. The three are pictured here at a press conference last month at the US Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia . The city has a troubled relationship with the American military after several rapes of local women allegedly by military, and an incident in which three drunk soldiers allegedly ran over and injured a group of pedestrians. Responding to rumours that some of the soldiers were infected with ebola, the mayor said today: 'The Prefect and the military authorities have assured me that all the American soldiers returned from Africa are healthy. Not a single one has symptoms of ebola. They are all being constantly monitored, according to official protocol.' The military has said soldiers in West Africa will not be in direct contact with Ebola patients and that their risk is very low. All personnel who spend time in West Africa are also required to monitor their temperatures to ensure that they have not caught the disease. Ebola is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of infected people. However, the quarantine in Italy reveals that the Department of Defense is stepping its precautions in the wake of Dr Craig Spencer show symptoms of the illness after returning to New York following aid work in Guinea. He went out to restaurants, rode the subway and hit up a bowling alley in Brooklyn before coming down with symptoms.","Eleven American soldiers have been quarantined at the US Army garrison in Vincenza, Italy, after returning from Liberia .

"Pope Francis has called for abolition of life imprisonment calling it a 'hidden' death sentence. Francis denounced what he called a 'penal populism' that offers revenge for victims instead of pursuing true justice. He told representatives from the International Association of Penal Law: 'It is impossible to imagine that states today cannot make use of another means than capital punishment to defend peoples' lives from an unjust aggressor.' Pope Francis has called for abolition of life imprisonment calling it a 'hidden' death sentence . During talks with the International Association of Penal Law, the pope said even those only under suspicion of crimes were being punished and that pretrial detention was being used unlawfully . Francis said the media and politicians advocated 'violence and revenge, public and private, not only against those responsible for crimes, but also against those under suspicion, justified or not'. Catholic teaching does not proscribe capital punishment, the pope said. According to the Catechism, 'the traditional teaching of the church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor'. But modern advances mean that cases in which execution is an absolute necessity 'are very rare, if not practically non-existent,' he insisted. The pope, who lived for many years under the repressive junta regime in Argentina, which was responsible for the forced disappearance and murder of thousands of civilians, said that there was a misconception in today's world that all social problems can be cured through punishment, 'as if different diseases could all be cured by the same medicine'. He said that Christians must also oppose life long incarceration as a 'a hidden death penalty'. The Vatican recently eliminated life imprisonment from its own penal code. He said that cases in which execution is an absolute necessity 'are very rare, if not practically non-existent' 'All Christians and men of good faith are therefore called upon today to fight, not only for the abolition of the death penalty – whether it is legal or illegal and in all its forms... and this, for me, is linked to life sentences. A sentence of life (without parole) is a hidden death penalty.' It remains to be seen whether the pope's words have any effect in the U.S. where 60 per cent say they are in favour of the death penalty. One third of Americans were raised Catholic but half of foreign born residents of America are of Catholic backgrounds. Francis also condemned the process of extraordinary rendition, used by the CIA since the September 11th attacks. He said some states used 'extra-judicial executions' as an unintended consequence of an action. Francis also warned against the use of pretrial detention. He said it is being used improperly as another form of unlawful punishment that is 'hidden behind legality'. He said: 'In the world today, torture is used not only as a means to achieve a particular purpose, such as a confession or an accusation - practices that are characteristic of a doctrine of national security - but also adds to the evil of detention.' He continued: 'Criminal code itself bears responsibility for having allowed, in certain cases, the legitimacy of torture under certain conditions, opening the way for further abuse.'","Francis said it was 'impossible to imagine' states couldn't find alternatives .

The shelter had three different escape routes: by the theatre, in a shaft by the tennis court and underneath a pond. It was also equipped with a double set of steel, gas-proof doors, and a sophisticated air filtering system that could provide oxygen for 15 people for 3-6 hours. But Marco Placidi, president of 'Underground Rome', said really it wasn’t as secure as Mussolini's later, more hi-tech bunkers, because it was only a few metres underground. He added: ‘And it must have been very inconvenient because the bunker was located in the garden some 100-150 metres away from the living quarters.’ Now the historic site is set to be opened to the public.

When the fascist leader began to believe that his life was under threat he had some 12 bunkers for the private use of him and his family built all over Rome in preparation for an allied bombardment. In fact it was in July 1943 the Commander of the Royal Air Force (RAF) asked permission from Winston Churchill to eliminate Il Duce. Their plan was to simultaneously bomb his official residence, Villa Torlonia and fascist HQ in Piazza Venezia. But Foreign Minister Anthony Eden had doubts about the plot’s success and feared the collateral damage on civilians and the Eternal City. Last year engineers carrying out maintenance work on the foundations of former fascist headquarters came across an iron hatch which led to another unknown bunker. There are no official records of the unfinished bunker which was designed only for Mussolini himself and his mistress, Claretta Petacci. Mussolini was exiled from Rome in 1943 and fled to the Apennine mountains. He was rescued by Nazis but his safety was shortlived - in April 1945 both he and Petacci were captured by partisans and executed.","Bunker deep beneath Mussolini's home in Rome has opened to the public .

"The price of olive oil  is set to soar after a widespread failure of the annual harvest in large parts of Italy. A wet summer in combination with a fruit fly blight has led to some producers not harvesting at all this year. The price is expected to rise by £2 a bottle after production fell by up to 80 per cent in some areas of Italy, a farmers' cooperative said. Bad year: A wet summer in combination with a fruit fly blight (pictured) has led to some olive oil producers in Italy not harvesting at all this year . Silvio Bandinelli of the Tuscan Olive Growers Coop said: ‘The new oil will cost 2-3 euro more per litre compared to last year, or an average of 10 euro a litre. Some producers have decided not produce extra virgin because the flavour of the oil will be too acidic. Others have cut their losses by not harvesting at all, according to the Confederation of Agricultural producers in Italy (CIA). Renzo Modesti of CIA in Florence said that the hot spring followed by a wet summer had led to a poor start to the year. He explained: ‘Because of this we were already expecting a harvest of less than 20 per cent. But the arrival of the fruit fly has blown everything up in smoke. No virgins: Some producers have decided not produce extra virgin because the flavour will be too acidic . Bad crop: The olive fly lays its egg in a hollow in the olive and when hatched the larvae tunnels its way out gnawing at the flesh destroying the fruit . Liquid gold: The price is set to rise by £2 per bottle . 'There are so many small and medium producers who this year will not harvest because the fly has eaten all their olives leaving only the skin and the stone.' The olive fruit fly or Bactrocera oleae, lays its egg in a hollow in the olive and when hatched the larvae tunnels its way out gnawing at the flesh destroying the fruit. Only those larger farms with technical prowess to treat their trees with pesticides managed to reduce their losses by around a third. Filippo Chiocchini, who owns an organic farm Poggio al Sole near Florence, said he had suffered losses of 30,000 euros. He wrote on Facebook:’The organic farms have been hit worse than the others by this fatal year. It’s a shame to give up the harvest but this is real farming which depends on natural methods.' Paolo Calosi owner of a farm in in Sesto Fiorentino, Tuscany, where 1000 trees were hit by the fly, said: ‘Unfortunately this year we will not produce extra virgin oil because the fly has damaged all the trees. 'This will produce a very acidic oil which cannot be sold as extra virgin. 'It will in any case have a nasty aftertaste with a marked woody flavour.' Roberto Nocentini of Coldiretti Tuscany said: ‘It’s difficult to quantify the loss in production because the situation changes not only from area to area but from grove to grove. Italy may have to import olive oil this year.'","A wet summer and fruit fly blight had led to a bad olive harvest in Italy .

"How? Mother Firuza Gainiyeva, 44, questioned how her daughter and her boyfriend were allowed to leave Britain . Two teenage runaways who fled their top British public school to go on a Caribbean holiday were effectively expelled by the headmaster yesterday and told not to return. Indira Gainiyeva, 17, and Edward Bunyan, 16, will not be returning to the prestigious £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, after their parents travelled to  the Dominican Republic to bring them home. Andrew Johnson, headmaster of Stonyhurst, a Jesuit Catholic school, is understood to have asked the parents to remove their children from the school with immediate effect. He said another Jesuit boarding school had offered the pupils an interview to give them ‘a last chance to make a success of their sixth-form education’. The decision came as Indira’s mother Firuza, 44, blamed Britain – as well as young love – for her daughter’s disappearance. Speaking from the family mansion in Kyzylorda, Kazakhstan, she said: ‘There are many shades in this story. For example, how did she manage to leave the country? How did Britain let them go at their age? Why did this other country let them in? ‘I think it was both love and a  strict school,’ she added. ‘They ran away, then they got scared, they  are children. Thank God, they can go back to studying. They will get on with their education. ‘I only thank God she is alive and healthy. And I thank God she will be back at school.’ The young couple fled from the 400-year-old Roman Catholic boarding school in Clitheroe in the early hours of January 13, after telling friends they wanted to escape from the rain. They took a taxi to Manchester airport and boarded a plane to the Dominican Republic, where they were found, a week later, staying in an apartment in the resort of Punta Cana. Indira’s father Ravil and Edward’s mother Susannah flew out to be with them and they are all now staying in a five-star all-inclusive resort. The families are expected to fly back within the next few days. Escapade: Indira Gainiyeva, left, and Edward Bunyan, right, are pictured at the five-star beach resort they fled to . In Punta Cana yesterday, Mrs Bunyan declined to comment but Mr Gainiyev was pictured trying to reason with his daughter, who was clearly upset. A relative of Indira said that the girl feared having to return to conservative Kazakhstan after an internet backlash in her home country. The relative said: ‘She told her father, “How can I go back to school, and how can I live anywhere now? I face shame and disgrace. I cannot live calmly in Kazakhstan, everyone will point a finger at me”.’ An official statement released yesterday by Stonyhurst said that Edward and Indira’s parents withdrew their children from the school after long-distance phone discussions with the head about the repercussions of their children’s behaviour. But The Mail on Sunday understands that decision was made after Mr Johnson made it clear to all parties that the pupils’ continued position at Stonyhurst was untenable. Tropical: One of the sandy beaches enjoyed by the runaways . A school insider said: ‘Although they have not been formally expelled, the effect is exactly the same – they won’t be returning  to Stonyhurst. Both pupils have been withdrawn at the headmaster’s request.’ The Mail on Sunday understands that Edward and Indira have been offered interviews at £25,000-a-year boarding school Mount St Mary’s College near Sheffield. Past pupils include Victorian  poet Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Lofting, who wrote the Doctor Dolittle books. Mr Johnson said he helped to arrange the interviews after both pupils had given an account of  their behaviour to their parents,  and apologised. ‘I have spoken to the head there and as a result have secured interviews for both Edward and Indira  at the school. It is now up to them to take it forward,’ he said. ‘They have both said sorry for what they have done and for the distress they have caused and we wouldn’t want to leave them high and dry, no matter what they have done. They have been given a  last chance.’ 'Untenable': The students cannot return to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire . Mr Johnson added: ‘In a way, what has happened has been a lesson to others who might be contemplating the same thing. ‘Pupils may have first thought that this was some kind of exciting adventure, but they soon saw all the trouble that Edward and Indira’s actions have caused. ‘They also saw that sooner or later they had to face the consequences of their actions, which have led to Edward and Indira being unable  to return to school. ‘All of a sudden it no longer looks like such a good idea. That in itself is a very powerful deterrent.’ A member of the Gainiyev family said yesterday that Indira’s wealthy father accepted that his daughter wanted to continue to study with Edward. The relative said: ‘He now wants  to see her at this new school with Eddy, and that both of them can do as well as possible so they can go  on to good universities.’","Indira Gainiyeva, 17, and Edward Bunyan, 16, fled school for five-star holiday .

The book compiled by David Geisser, a 24-year-old soldier from Zurich who originally trained as a professional chef, includes delicacies from the three popes' home nations of Argentina, Germany and Poland. Pope Francis seemingly has a sweet tooth and has introduced 'dulce de leche', a caramelised milk pudding popular in Argentina, to the Vatican menu, as well as traditional Latin American empanadas. John Paul hankered after the Polish favourite, Pierogi, a stuffed pasta dish, and demanded it while recovering from a 1981 assassination attempt. Benedict was keen on Bavarian dishes such as wurstel salad and baked cherries with cream. The recipe book, published this week in German, contains the recipes preferred by his colleagues in the guard as well as various popes and prelates. Recipes favoured by Vatican Secretary of State, cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the prefect of the Papal Household monsignor George Gainswein also figure in the collection. Papal choice: Pope Francis, left, has a penchant for traditional Latin American empanadas, right . Swiss Guard commander Daniel Anrig said 'A soldier can only fight and wage war when he has eaten well, and enough.' But he left no doubt as to where his loyalties lie. 'There is nothing like Italian cuisine, it is the best in the world,' he said. Swiss Guards are the Swiss soldiers who have served as bodyguards of the Pope since the 16th century and are responsible for the security of the apostolic palace. They must be single Catholic men aged between 19 and 30, and at least 5ft 8.5ins tall. They swear allegiance to the Pope and are famous for their Renaissance-style uniform, with a plumed feather in their helmet, leggings and a high ruff collar.","Francis's favourite foods are empanadas and dulce de leche, book reveals .

"An international human trafficking ring forced migrants to sell their organs as payment for their journey from Africa to Europe, an Italian police investigation has revealed. Five people have been arrested as part of the probe into the gang, which allegedly arranges the harvesting of kidneys and other organs of migrants arriving in Europe by boat. Italy, with its southern-most province Lampedusa just 80 miles from Africa, is the gateway for many seeking new lives in Europe. Almost 150,000 have made the journey so far in 2014. Around 3000 have died attempting the journey this year. Uncertain journey: Five people have been arrested as part of the probe into the gang, which allegedly arranges the harvesting of kidneys and other organs of migrants arriving in Europe by boat . Unseaworthy: The group of Libyans and Eritreans allegedly demanded that asylum seekers pay €1,500 (£1,200) up front to board one of the often overcrowded and unseaworthy boats . The group of Libyans and Eritreans allegedly demanded that asylum seekers pay €1,500 (£1,200) up front to board one of the often overcrowded and unseaworthy boats. Those who could not immediately pay the full price were given the option of paying after arrival, according to court documents seen by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. Upon landing in Italy, the gang decided whether to 'use them as manpower or organ donors,' according to the arrest warrant. Investigating magistrate Tiziana Coccoluto wrote that the situation of the migrants was like that of slaves, with the gangsters having the power to sell them off to other criminal groups. Decision: Upon landing in Italy, the gang decided whether to 'use them as manpower or organ donors,' according to the arrest warrant . Tragedy: Police suspect that other gang members are responsible for the tragedy off the island of Lampedusa last year that killed 300 people on October 3 2013 .

Around 3000 have died attempting the journey this year . The gang's 'treasurer' Michael Brhane, was among those arrested, along with four other men - Haile Seifu, Russom Gebrem Michael Henok, and Tesfay Bahta - who allegedly worked as cashiers collecting money owed in Italy. The five face charges of human trafficking aiding illegal immigration. Police suspect that other gang members are responsible for the tragedy off the island of Lampedusa last year that killed 300 people on October 3 2013. The evidence found is thought to be only the tip of the iceberg of the international trade in organs. The bodies of migrants lacking organs are often found in the north african Sinai desert, Alganesh Fessaha, an activist campaigning against trafficking, has warned. Last year, one of the world's most wanted organ traffickers, Gedalya Tauber, a retired Israeli police officer, was arrested in Rome. He was previously convicted of recruiting from impoverished neighbourhoods in Brazil buying kidneys for as little as $3000, for mainly the Israeli market. The operation would then take place in a hospital in Durban South Africa with clients paying as much as 20 times the sum received by the donor.","Italian police have smashed trafficking ring made up of Libyans and Eritreans .

"An Italian miner was permitted to be off sick for 35 years after claiming he was claustrophobic. Coal miner Carlo Cani started work in 1980 and retired early, drawing a pension despite hardly ever putting in a day's work over a 35-year career. The case is just the latest example of how thousands of state workers in Italy find loopholes in the rules to duck out of their job. Carlo Can't... An Italian miner was off sick for 35 years after claiming he was claustrophobic. Stock image . Mr Cani admits he took an immediate dislike to mining and began doing everything he could to avoid venturing down the mine shaft in Sardinia where he was employed. The 60-year-old managed to take years of sick leave, apparently with the help of accommodating doctors. Over the years he faked amnesia and haemorrhoids, rubbed coal dust into his eyes to feign an infection and on occasion staggered around pretending to be drunk. He was able to stay at home listening to jazz. He was also granted extended time off on reduced pay when demand for coal from the mine dipped. But despite years sat on the sofa, he was still officially an employee of the mining company, and entitled to a pension. Mr Cani acknowledges: 'I reached the pensionable age without hardly ever working. I hated being underground. He explained: 'Right from the start, I had no affinity for coal.' 'I invented everything – amnesia, pains, haemorrhoids, I used to lurch around as if I was drunk. I bumped my thumb on a wall and obviously you can't work with a swollen thumb,' Mr Cani told La Stampa. 'Other times I would rub coal dust into my eyes. I just didn't like the work – being a miner was not the job for me.' 'I had no affinity for coal': Carlo Cani admits he took an immediate dislike to mining and began doing everything he could to avoid venturing down the mine shaft in Sardinia where he was employed.

"The EU has attacked Britain over its pioneering food 'traffic light' system . British efforts to combat the swelling obesity epidemic have been torpedoed by meddling Eurocrats. The EU has attacked Britain over its pioneering food 'traffic light' system, in a case that could end up in the European courts. The system is designed to help parents and consumers make healthy choices, by labelling food items red, green or orange according to their fat, salt and sugar contents. Health professionals are losing the battle in the war against obesity. Six in ten British adults and one in three children are now obese. The European Commission opened infraction proceedings against Britain in February after Mediterranean countries complained that the system would damage the sales of their high fat exports such as Nutella, olive oils, salamis and cheeses. Brussels said the scheme could be 'discriminatory' because it 'discourages certain purchases, penalises industry and distorts the functioning of the internal market.' Spokesman Miguel Sagredo said the European Commission has sent a letter of formal notice to Britain that requires a reply within two months. Sagredo said: 'The commission will seek information from the UK authorities on how this system will negatively affect the marketing of several products. ' 'The concern that we have is that the system is likely to make the marketing of some products more difficult and therefore hinder or impede trade between EU countries.' The 'simplistic' character of the traffic light system might in certain instances create misconceptions among consumers, he said. The European Commission opened infraction proceedings against Britain after Mediterranean countries complained that the system would damage the sales of their high fat exports such as cheese . Italy says it stood to lose 6-700million euros a year in sales in the traffic light system . National farmers association Coldiretti claims the scheme fails to distinguish between junk food and traditional products with high fat that are part of a balanced healthy Mediterranean diet. It said : 'The aim of the traffic-light system is to reduce the consumption of fat, salt and sugar, but it's based only on the presence of certain substances, rather than on the actual quantities that are consumed,' said in statement. 'Paradoxically, this ends up excluding things like extra-virgin olive oil from diets, while promoting sugar-free fizzy drinks, misleading consumers about the real nutritional value (of the items)'. But the scheme, which is voluntary and fully legally compliant with EU food law, has been praised in other quarters, with BEUC, the European Consumers' Organisation, calling for it to be extended throughout the EU. The World Cancer Research Fund today defended the UK’s ‘traffic light’ food labelling system. In a statement it said: 'World Cancer Research Fund UK was instrumental in lobbying for a food labelling system to help consumers understand the nutritional content of food products. 'In the UK, where obesity linked to poor diet is an important public health issue, the traffic light system means consumers can make informed choices about the food they eat. 'World Cancer Research Fund UK believes that the simple red, amber and green guide helps consumers make informed food and drink choices and so reduce their cancer risk. 'A consistent front-of-pack labelling system was something WCRF UK sought as part of the wider fight against rising rates of obesity.'","The EU has attacked Britain over its pioneering food 'traffic light' system .

"Prices of Italian wine are expected to rise in UK supermarkets due to a 15% drop in wine production . Italian wine makers are facing their worst harvest for 50 years, after record summer rains decimated the crop. With sick plants and up to a third less quality grapes on the vine in some areas, prices are expected to rise in UK supermarkets. The vineyards are on track to produce 41m hectolitres of wine this year, a 15 per cent drop on last year's harvest, the Ministry of Agriculture said. It means Italy is on track to lose its crown to France as the world’s biggest wine producer. After a washout summer, Puglia and Sicily in the south are set to be the worst hit regions, with production down by a third. Only some central areas will see a small rise, with the harvest falling across the whole north of the country. ‘2014 risks being classified it the most meagre harvest since 1950,’ Coldiretti, the country's biggest agricultural association said. Prosecco farmers have had to work very hard throughout August to maintain the quality of the grapes. Enologist Arturo Ziliani said :‘We have had a scrupulous cull of the grapes on the vine necessary to preserve the quality of the vintage. 'As a result we expect a fall in quantity of around 30 per cent. ‘ . Only one fifth of the grapes have so far been picked, Coldiretti said, with the harvest set to continue to November as some grapes ripen late. Ziliani said: ‘We will remember 2014 as the latest harvest in 15 years. ‘ . Some vineyards have refused to produce their best wines this year, not wishing to compromise on quality. Experts said that prices hikes due to will generally be passed on to consumers. Barolo will rise to around 800 Euro per hundred litres while Pinot Grigio will see a modest rise, an investigation by Italian website Wine News predicted. But the consortia of Prosecco producers said the cost of a glass of bubbly will stay the same-it will not pass on the costs of lower production to consumers.

"Accused: Gucci heir Guccio Gucci has been arrested for alleged fraud worth 800,000 euros (£650,000) Gucci heir Guccio Gucci has been arrested for alleged fraud worth 800,000 euros (£650,000). The Florentine fashion entrepreneur, named after his great grandfather, the world famous fashion label’s founder, is accused of removing hundreds of thousands of pounds from the coffers of his own fashion company to pay off personal debts, before declaring bankruptcy. Mr Gucci, who worked at the family company for 12 years before leaving in 1989 has been put under house arrest following the seizure of 400,000 euros. Financial police said Mr Gucci, the owner of the fashion brand TobG, which named a handbag after the Duchess of Cambridge, declared bankruptcy in December after removing 800,000 euros in cash and assets from the company. According to police he transferred all the assets to a new company with a head office in Perugia. The investigating magistrate in Florence wrote in the arrest warrant: ‘Gucci, the great-grandson of the founder of the label Gucci, skilfully exploited the goodwill of some individuals with few scruples to pursue his intents. ‘We are not looking at the classic example of problems of a company that has failed because of the crisis. The operation was a complex one and was designed almost entirely to pay off some debts.’ Prosecutor Christine Von Borries said that Gucci acting with another conspirator ‘emptied the coffers of the company so as to render debt collection by the Italian Inland Revenue of 386,000 euros for the years 2007-12 impossible.' Patrizia Reggiani, left, who was dubbed the Black Widow, serving 18 years for mudering Maurizio Gucci, and Guccio Gucci, right, who founded the fashion label . The dynasty has been plagued by rifts and infighting. In 2012 the fashion heir and his brother Alessandro were sued by Gucci for trademark infringement. The company has also taken legal action against three others members of the families for using their famous name to launch products. Patriarch Guccio Gucci originally founded the label as a family-owned saddlery and luggage shop in Florence in 1920, later adding handbags. In 2012 Guccio Cucci and his brother Alessandro were sued by Gucci for trademark infringement . His son Aldo was convicted of tax fraud in the US in 1986 and served a year in a Florida jail. Guccio's grandson Maurizio took over as chairman but was accused by his cousins of forgery. In 1995 he was shot dead outside his office.

"Two years ago, English expatriate Patricia Wilson disappeared from her house in South West France - her body has never been found . It is two years since English expatriate Patricia Wilson disappeared from her house in South West France, and the police arrested her gardener and sometime lover. The trail of blood and destruction suggested a brutal murder. Jean-Louis Cayrou, 52, who was arrested for her alleged murder after traces of Patricia’s blood were found in his car, remains in custody, yet no date has been set for a trial. Her body has never been found. And only now – after it was sealed off as a crime scene – has her partner been able to move back to the house they shared in an attempt to press police to bring her killer to justice, and to find her body. Speaking exclusively in the sitting room of the pretty stone farmhouse in the Aveyron area that they bought six years ago, former businessman Donald Marcus’s voice drops to a whisper as he points to the far end of the house. ‘She was killed in the adjoining barn and dragged through the kitchen diner into here before her body was pulled down through the French windows and down the steps into the garden,’ he said. ‘There was a massive sweep of blood showing the trail. The house was trashed, everything upended and flung around as if someone was in a rage.’ The scene – which triggered a huge air and land search in this deeply forested countryside criss-crossed by rivers and jagged ravines – is clearly still vivid in the 56-year-old’s mind. He was back in Britain seeking medical treatment when Patricia, then 58, disappeared, and the gruesome scene was described to him by friends who went to the house after becoming worried she had not been seen. Cayrou has denied killing Patricia despite evidence of DNA found in and on his car that matched that of the vivacious brunette, claiming he had stumbled across the bloody scene and fled because he feared he would be blamed. ‘I had the house industrially cleaned before I set foot in it again,’ Donald says. ‘I’ve come back because I want justice for Pat. ‘I have no doubts she was murdered her and I beg the killer to tell us where her body is. ‘If they don’t, I will never be able to put her to rest. My life is invested in this house – it is all I have left. But I see what happened here vividly and I have to think: “It is just a house, the house we loved.” I have nowhere else to go. My whole life is here. Tied up in this house.’ Former advertising executive Patricia met Donald in 2004 at a pub in Yorkshire. They fell in love and built a house together and got engaged – she had never married and he was divorced and childless. Donald Marcus, who moved to rural France with Patricia after they met in 2004, was in the UK receiving treatment for multiple sclerosis when Patricia was killed . Later, they decide to move to rural France in search of a stress-free, healthier and happier life. Money was not a problem. Their house sold for £400,000, Pat cashed in a £115,000 pension pot to add to her savings and Donald sold his business renovating old properties for £185,000 to add to his own substantial savings. They pinpointed Aveyron in the Midi-Pyrenees, a sparsely populated, though tourist-driven area with its gorges and medieval towns and villages. They fell in love with Les Landes Basses, a wisteria-clad fermette with outbuildings and 11 acres including a small river and lake near the village of Vabre-Tizac. They paid £260,000 at the height of the market and spent a further £85,000 on renovations. With the French housing market in freefall, Donald has been told it is now worth less than £150,000. Back then it seemed perfection. ‘Who could not love it?’ he says. ‘We were so happy. There are a lot of ex-pats here and we quickly made friends. We were very social and enjoyed the relaxed way of life. We worked together on the house. Accused: Jean-Louis Cayrou (left) has denied murdering Patricia. but remains in custody. Smears of Patricia's blood were left at the crime scene (right) and were also found in Mr Cayrou's car . ‘I read we were victims of “living the dream”. We weren’t – we knew exactly what we were doing and could afford to do it. And then I became ill and everything stopped.’ Several months before Patricia disappeared, Donald returned to England after he started to lose feeling in his legs, frequently falling. ‘It was embarrassing,’ he says. ‘The French doctors seemed baffled so I decided to go home. Pat stayed here and I didn’t realise I would be away for so long. I took one small bag.’ In Leeds he was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis with no chance of remission. He is now confined to a wheelchair with limited movement from the chest down, barely able to pull himself on to a sofa or bed. He sleeps at one end of the sitting room, having converted an adjoining space into a wet room. A specially equipped and modified van allows him to shop and visit the local bar for company. ‘I was always coming back,’ he says firmly. ‘When I told Patricia on the phone of the diagnosis, she burst into tears and said she would convert the downstairs around me and then I could come home. She never wavered in that.’ But as Donald stayed in England seeing specialist after specialist, Patricia turned to an itinerant local man, Cayrou, who lived in a caravan, for help with heavy jobs and the garden. Police believe they became lovers in the April and he moved into the house. She told at least one friend it was finished with Donald and he would not be returning. Friends suggest she had a turbulent, at times violent relationship with Cayrou and threw him out three months later, four weeks before her death. He couldn’t accept it and pestered her constantly by phone, even breaking into her house to frighten her, with his hand on her throat. She became increasingly worried for her safety. The exterior of the property, in Aveyron in the Midi-Pyrenees, where Patricia was allegedly murdered . Donald says he knew nothing of the drama and still spoke regularly by phone to Patricia while planning their new adapted future. ‘I knew nothing of any lover until she disappeared – was killed,’ he claims. ‘But I don’t blame her and never have. I don’t judge her – I love her. She was a woman alone dealing with this house. ‘It’s said that he’s nice and charming and, well, she was vulnerable. These things happen.’ Speaking in a monotone voice caused by his condition and heavy medication, Mr Marcus is a shadow of the vibrant, fit man who arrived in France filled with dreams of a new beginning with the woman he had fallen in love with four years earlier. ‘Who would have believed when we set off for France that it would end like this?’ he says. ‘Every time someone says, “well, it can’t get worse,” I tell them: “Oh yes it can.” Yet if I could go back in time and do it all over again – I would.’ Later this month, Donald will attend a hearing for an official certificate of death to be issued. He says: ‘Because we were not married my rights are limited. Our joint account and thousands of pounds of my money has been frozen and can’t be released until she is declared dead. I just want what is mine.’ Donald is certain he will end his days in the house he and Pat adored. He talks of having a ‘wake’ for her next spring. ‘I haven’t had time to grieve,’ he adds. ‘Maybe that will help, even if there is no body.’","Advertising executive Patricia Wilson met Donald Marcus in a pub in 2004 .

"Shrien Dewani, pictured at his trial, 'threw a pizza party for 500 people days after ordering the hit on his new wife, Anni', her family claim . Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani threw a pizza party for 500 people days after allegedly masterminding a hit on his new wife, her family allege. The millionaire businessman was also so controlling during his engagement to Anni Dewani that she described him as behaving 'like Hitler', her‎ father Vinod Hindocha has claimed. Mr Hindocha said he was upset by the party - which took place six days after her murder in 2010 - because it was not in keeping with the family's Hindu religion. He said: 'I was offended by this as it is customary that no parties are held during the period of mourning yet Dewani did this stating that Anni loved pizza and chips and the pizza party was a memorial service to her. 'All the elder people - not just we relatives - were disappointed and questioned that such a party had been planned.' Dewani is accused of organising the murder of his wife in a staged carjacking as they drove through a Cape Town township. Mr Hindocha told police how his Swedish daughter often fought with Dewani during their courtship. After one row she told him 'not to regard her as a possession and threatened to leave him and return to Sweden,' he said. 'She also stated, ""Pappa, he is like a Hitler - but don't worry - I will get married.""' On one occasion she was so upset by Dewani she announced she would 'manage her own life' after their wedding, he said. ‎Mr Hindocha also told how 'arrogant' Dewani upset the family after his daughter's death and allegedly 'manhandled' her body. He said Dewani insisted on helping his elder daughter Ami, 37 and her cousin Sneha, 31, prepare the Swedish engineering graduate for her funeral. He added: 'It serves to mention that this is out of the ordinary in the Hindu custom as only females are tasked with this when a female dies. 'After their return from the funeral parlour both Ami and Sneha came to report to me that some strange thing had happened at the parlour. 'Ami stated that Dewani had attempted to place some gold bangles onto Anni's wrist and when he experienced trouble doing this, tried to force then on and then asked for some soap, hoping this would solve the problem. 'Ami had then stopped him as she as of the opinion that he was manhandling Anni's body. She also thought him to be insensitive, as he rushed them along, stating that had to leave the funeral parlour.' Dewani is accused of organising the murder of his wife in a staged carjacking as they drove through a Cape Town township . Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, said he was upset by the party which he claims took place six days after his daughter's death in November 2010 . Dewani also refused to allow his wife's mother and other family members to spend just 30 minutes with the body to pay their last respects privately, saying there was not enough time, Mr Hindocha claimed. The next morning he said the care home tycoon stormed into the funeral parlour and forbade the Hindochas, who were gathered around Anni, from putting roses in her coffin. Mr Hindocha added: 'l was the first person to walk up to the coffin to do so but when I tried to, Dewani refused, stating ""I don't want this coffin to look like a dustbin"". 'He also gave me a look I can only describe as vicious. 'The roses were placed in a corner. After the ceremony Preyen intervened and handed the roses to Dewani to place in the coffin.' Dewani threatened to call off Anni's memorial service if any of the Hindochas attended, claiming to have been upset by his father-in-law, it was claimed. ‎Mr Hindocha also told how as suspicions grew over Dewani in the days after the murder, the businessman's brother Preyen took him to to a meeting with the the now disgraced PR guru Max Clifford. He said: 'Preyen asked me to accompany him to a man called Max Clifford where he wanted me to make a statement denying that there was any animosity between the two families… he also wanted me to sign a document stating this but I declined.' ‎Mr Hindocha made his claims in a statement given to police which formed part of the case against Xolile Mngeni who was earlier convicted of shooting Anni. Mngeni died in jail on Saturday from cancer. Dewani, from Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, denies murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice.","Shrien Dewani allegedly threw a pizza party 6 days after wife Anni was killed .

"A parliamentary aide who claims to have had gay sex with honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani is expected to give evidence at his trial. The unnamed adviser – said to mix in high circles at Westminster – allegedly met the millionaire businessman at The Hoist gay nightclub in London. He is understood to have had sex with him on several occasions and claimed that Dewani was a ‘submissive’ who enjoyed dressing up in leather. Sources have confirmed the aide is scheduled to appear at Cape Town’s Western Cape High Court next week as a prosecution witness. Trial: Shrien Dewani on the stand in South Africa where he has admitted being bisexual and to using male prostitutes. Today it was revealed that a British parliamentary aide is expected to give evidence . Dewani is accused of orchestrating the murder of his 28-year-old wife Anni in a staged carjacking on their honeymoon four years ago . Dewani, 34, is accused of orchestrating the murder of his 28-year-old wife Anni Dewani in a staged carjacking during their honeymoon four years ago. As his trial opened this week, he dramatically admitted to being bisexual and having sex with male prostitutes and men he had met online and in clubs. The aide, who lives in London, is understood to have come forward after Dewani’s then spokesman, Max Clifford, denied that he was gay in the weeks after the murder. He first met Dewani 11 years ago when the care home tycoon was in his early 20s. Dewani was said to be well known on the London gay scene and often attended Hoist in Vauxhall, south London, which has a ‘strictly enforced’ dress code consisting of leather, uniform, rubber and other fetish clothing. The aide is said to have talked to officers from Scotland Yard who passed the information on to the South African authorities.

Mrs Dewani was left feeling ‘embarrassed and hurt’ by his actions, she said in a statement made to Scotland Yard detectives and passed on to South African prosecutors.

"Missing: Alice Gross was last seen on August 28 . Scores of foreign killers and rapists living in Britain are being monitored only by email. They merely have to write to probation officers in their homeland every fortnight saying where they are living. The revelation comes as the hunt for Arnis Zalkalns – the Latvian murderer wanted over missing Alice Gross – became the biggest since the 7/7 terror attacks. The 41-year-old has been allowed to enter and leave Britain repeatedly since he arrived here in 2005 – a freedom that has raised serious questions about the supervision of EU criminals. Between 30 and 50 convicted Latvians living in the UK are being supervised by probation officers from the Baltic state. Harry Fletcher, a former official with the probation union Napo, said it was common in Eastern Europe for no travel restrictions to be imposed when offenders leave jail. In Latvia, the authorities do not even have a postal address for ex-offenders. Yet British murderers are subject to stringent supervision for the rest of their lives, having to report to probation teams and seek permission to travel abroad. Mr Fletcher, who is a director of the Digital Trust, a charity that campaigns against online abuse, said: ‘It appears that there are scores of people coming in from European countries, including Latvia, who have been convicted of a range of offences from theft to murder who the British authorities are not aware of. ‘They are able to come here as long as they check in through email. But the system is open to abuse as an email account can be falsified. This is a legal loophole that needs closing.’ Scroll down for video . Jean Taylor, founder of campaign group Families for Justice, said: ‘For these serious criminals to be let into Britain without anyone knowing of their past, then to learn that there is no proper monitoring, even in their own countries, is a farce and an insult to their victims.’ Scotland Yard learnt of Zalkalns’ murder conviction last week only after making urgent inquiries through Interpol when he became a suspect in 14-year-old Alice’s disappearance. Officers believe he may have fled back to Latvia. Talent: Alice Gross performing a song in a video released by her family after the 14-year-old disappeared . Searches have intensified since police discovered that their prime suspect, who calls himself ‘Wolf’ on social media, had served six and half years in jail in his native Latvia for the murder of his wife in 1997. Zalkalns went missing from his home in Ealing, west London, on September 3. Convicted: Arnis Zalkalns served six and half years in jail in  Latvia for the murder of his wife in 1997 . Alice was last seen on August 28 walking along the Grand Union Canal, also in west London, followed by Zalkalns on a bicycle 15 minutes later. The mountain bike has been found at an address Zalkalns used about a mile and a half from the last sighting of Alice. Six hundred officers from eight forces are scouring ten square miles of land and three miles of canals and rivers. Police frogmen and sniffer dogs were last night exploring the waters and towpaths near Ealing Hospital and Brent Lodge Park. Alice is from nearby Hanwell. Detective Superintendent Carl Mehta, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘Our thoughts continue to go out to Alice’s family as our search continues in a bid to find her. We will not stop our hunt for Alice.’ Last night a Latvian police source said: ‘We have been asked by the British police to start searching for Arnis Zalkalns in Latvia. 'There is a possibility he might have fled here so we are doing everything we can to help.’ Zalkalns has not accessed his bank account or used his mobile phone since he went missing. His passport was left at his house which he occupied with his girlfriend and their young daughter. He left in the dead of night. Last sighting: CCTV images show a man believed to be Zalkalns crossing Brentford Lock at around 4pm .","Criminals merely have to write to probation officers in homeland fortnightly .

"Pope Francis urged bishops to say 'speak their minds' today as a historic sex conference got underway at the Vatican. The pope hailed the synod of bishops as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to review Catholic teaching on controversial topics such as abortion, contraception and gay unions. The so-called Extraordinary Synod on the Family is discussing the results of a survey on relationships and sex sent to every diocese worldwide earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis delivers a speech to cardinals and bishops gathering for the Synod of the Families at the Vatican . Around 200 bishops will spend the next two weeks addressing the gulf between what the Church says about issues such as divorce and pre-marital sex, and what many followers actually do. 'You have to say what you feel the Lord tells you to say, without concerns of human respect and without fear,' Francis instructed the bishops at the start of their meeting. At the same time, he urged the nearly 200 cardinals, bishops and priests gathered for the synod to listen to one another with humility 'and welcome with an open heart what our brothers say.' The discussions beforehand have already caused bitter arguments among senior clergy. Reformist cardinals have already proposed allowing the divorced and remarried to take Communion. This is currently banned as the church does not recognise divorce so remarried people are regarded as adulterers. But conservative bishops are totally opposed to this move, believing it is a threat to the institution of marriage. In his opening speech the pope hailed the synod of bishops as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to review Catholic teaching on controversial topics such as abortion, contraception and gay unions . Other possible changes, such as the blessing of gay civil unions, would be even more contentious. Pope Francis seems determined to shake up the Church and has shown some signs of liberal views. 'Who am I to judge,' he said when asked about gay priests last year, and he previously baptised the child of a gay union in Argentina. While insisting he is a 'son of the church,' Francis has also said the church must show more mercy and be a 'field hospital' for wounded souls. Conservative churchmen are hoping that the synod will simply reaffirm church doctrine and make it better understood by Catholics. On the eve of the synod Francis said that the church should be less judgmental of those in non-conventional living situations such as couples who live together before marriage. He told an Argentine newspaper: 'What should the church do ? Expel them from their breast? or approach them and try to bring them close and teach them the word of God? I am in favour of the latter position.' Vatican Swiss Guards  salute as Pope Francis arrives for the morning session of the two-week synod . Opening the conference he warned the bishops not to merely express what they thought he wanted to hear. He urged participants: 'Say everything that you feel.' 'After the last consistory a cardinal wrote to me saying it was a shame that some cardinals did not have the courage to speak their minds out of respect for the pope thinking perhaps that the pope thought something different to them. This is not good.' In a bid to encourage debate, the Vatican is restricting public information about what is said behind closed doors during the synod. In the past it has released texts of individual bishops' comments.","Meeting will review Catholic teaching on a number of controversial topics .

"Police in Tuscany have seized over 160,000 litres of top dollar Brunello in a million pound wine scandal that has scandalised Chiantishire. Hundreds of thousands of bottles of cheap table wine were falsely labelled as two of the country’s most respected reds Brunello di Montalcino and Rosso di Montalcino wines, which can sell for up to £100 a bottle, it is alleged. The massive bust comes just months after opera star Andrea Bocelli became the victim of a scam in which cheap plonk was passed off as premium Brunello di Montalcino and Chianti from his estate in Tuscany. Hundreds of thousands of bottles of cheap table wine were falsely labelled as two of the country’s most respected reds Brunello di Montalcino and Rosso di Montalcino wines, it is alleged. Pictured are four bottles of Rosso di Montalcino . Financial police in Siena said on Tuesday they seized the wine, ‘with an estimated value of nearly one million euros, as part of an anti-fraud operation.’ A wine expert allegedly replaced the Brunello with rough wine, costing as little as 80p a litre, before using his influence with local producers to obtain official state labels and other authentic documents, invoices and transport records. The scam is thought to have cost wine producers in Tuscany, where Chianti and Brunello di Montalcino wines are produced, hundreds of thousands of pounds in lost sales. The enologist now faces charges of commercial fraud, illegal access to computers, aggravated and continued embezzlement. The massive bust comes just months after opera star Andrea Bocelli (pictured) became the victim of a scam in which cheap plonk was passed off as premium Brunello di Montalcino and Chianti from his estate in Tuscany . In May it was reported how Andrea Bocelli was scammed by conmen after they produced tens of thousands of fake bottles of his own branded wine - and sold it for up to ten times the price. The rip-off versions of Bocelli a Lajatico were sold in Italy and abroad alongside fake bottles of other classic Italian wines, such as Chianti and Brunello. Investigators trawled wine cellars, shops, supermarkets and bottling factories to uncover the scam.","Hundreds of thousands of bottles of cheap wine falsely labelled, it is alleged .

"Ashya King's brain cancer treatment will start next week after a series of successful tests at Prague's Proton Therapy Centre today. The five-year-old's father Brett admitted that his unwell son 'will be scared' but his mother Naghmeh will be there to hold his hand and both have 'every confidence' Czech doctors will cure him. Ashya was flown by private jet from Spain to Prague, where he is expected to start pioneering treatment for his brain tumour next week after being monitored by experts today. Scroll down for video . Good news: Ashya King leaves the Prague clinic this afternoon clutching a teddy  bear after a day of tests that mean his cancer treatment can start next week . Brett King, father of the five-year-old Ashya King, spoke today and believes that the care his son will receive abroad will save him . Doctors  warned Mr King that his son will suffer headache-like-pain as he inspected the proton beam machine that will treat him. He said: 'I'm so happy we can finally bring Ashya here. It is incredible, I have every confidence in it. 'It is daunting and Ashya will be scared but his mother will be holding his hand.' With his devoted parents by his side, Ashya King finally arrived at hospital in the Czech Republic yesterday – as his father declared: ‘It’s all worthwhile – he will get better.’ Just days ago, his parents were in a Spanish prison cell after being arrested for removing the youngster from an NHS hospital in Southampton without doctors’ permission and taking him abroad. But following a public outcry, the couple were released and reunited with their son, before being allowed to transfer him to Prague for the proton beam therapy treatment they desperately want for him. In a statement, the Proton Therapy Centre said: 'If all goes well and the physicists will be able to prepare Ashya's irradiation plan in four days already instead of standard 10 days, he will start the first irradiation on Monday . 'His plan takes 30 irradiation visits and is combined with chemotherapy. 'The chemotherapy will be applied by specialised oncologists at Motol University Hospital, where Ashya is hospitalised with his mother.' Fresh start: Ashya King arrived at Prague's Proton Therapy Centre this morning for tests before treatment his parents have 'every confidence' will cure his brain cancer . Family: The unwell five-year-old was again with his parents Brett and Naghmeh as he was wheeled into the clinic . Love: Brett King gives his son a kiss ahead of crucial tests to determine what care he can receive . As Ashya was stretchered from the ambulance yesterday, his father Brett, 51, said: ‘It’s amazing, I’m excited. Power to the people. ‘When you see my son you see why the whole thing we’ve been through has been worthwhile to get him better. He will get better.’ Ashya’s mother Naghmeh, 45, added: ‘I’m so happy to be here.’ Their emotional arrival came as it emerged Ashya’s treatment is expected to cost up to £70,000 – and could be paid for by the NHS. Miloslav Ludvik of the Motol University Hospital – where Ashya will stay while he is treated at the Proton Therapy Centre – said it was a ‘good question’ who would foot the bill. He said: ‘We are not concerned about the financial issues at the moment, what matters is treating the child. Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45,  were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow Ashya to undergo proton therapy in Eastern Europe . Visit: Yesterday Brett King visited the facility where his son will have proton beam therapy . 'But there are three options for payment eventually. Either the parents will pay, or the NHS will pay under new EU regulations or the parents will pay and then take the bill to the NHS for reimbursement.’ The NHS funds proton beam therapy abroad ‘whenever it is considered clinically appropriate’. However, NHS England does not fund proton therapy for medulloblastoma – the cancer that Ashya has – because of concern that patients not fit enough to travel would be delayed from receiving radiotherapy and subsequently have a reduced chance of a cure. Last year 99 children were fully funded by the NHS to go abroad for proton beam therapy. One method of funding is the S2, an arrangement between the NHS and the state healthcare provider in the EU country patients are visiting, which requires prior approval. A spokesman for University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘It is good news that Ashya’s treatment can be resumed without delay and we are delighted for him that the situation has now been resolved.’ Ashya is expected to be taken to the Proton Therapy Centre today for assessment, and if all goes well a six-week treatment programme will start next there on Monday. British paediatricians who treated Ashya have insisted that proton therapy is not suitable for his type of tumour. They want him to receive conventional radiotherapy. After being taken from Britain to Spain and then being isolated from his parents and family, Ashya King arrived in Prague for cancer treatment yesterday . The couple stroke young Ashya's head as they arrive in Prague yesterday. The five-year-old's mother said she was 'so happy' to be in the Czech Republic . The family travelled on a private jet from Malaga to Prague after being released from prison where they spent 72 hours . An ambulance carrying the child arrives at the centre where Ashya's treatment is expected to cost £70,000 . The five-year-old's mother Naghmeh accompanied him on both ambulance journeys in Spain and the Czech Republic . Ashya's parents removed him from Southampton hospital on August 28 without doctors' consent . The £30million Proton Therapy Centre where Ashya King is to be treated boasts state of the art cancer-fighting technology. Built in 2012, the gleaming white lobby of the five-storey building on the outskirts of Prague appears more like a modern hotel – complete with an 18ft tropical fish tank and red sofas. The centre says its treatment is more accurate than conventional radiotherapy because proton beams stop once they reach their target. For brain tumours, this reduces the radiation doses to other parts of the body by 60 per cent and halves the risk of secondary tumours, staff claim. A course of treatment takes from five to 30 visits. Sessions never last more than 30 minutes.

"Desperately ill Ashya King was left alone in hospital last night after his parents were locked up for a further 72 hours. Brett and Naghmeh King had begged a Spanish court to be allowed to visit their five-year-old son’s bedside. But a judge ruled they must stay in custody pending a decision on their extradition back to Britain. Lawyers and relatives say the pair are being treated like criminals for smuggling their son abroad to treat his aggressive brain tumour. Scroll down for video . Devoted: The Kings with Ashya at Southampton hospital before they took him to Spain . Ashya’s brothers have also apparently been barred from seeing him in hospital and the family fears his health will deteriorate rapidly without their love. In another day of drama: . Ashya’s parents took him out of Southampton General Hospital last week after reaching deadlock with doctors over his treatment. They fled to Spain where they hoped to sell their holiday home in the Costa del Sol to pay for specialist treatment in the Czech Republic. Mr King, 51, said doctors refused his pleas to consider referring Ashya for the proton beam radiotherapy in Prague and claimed they threatened to get a court order if he interfered with his son’s medical treatment. Arrested: Brett and Naghmeh King (pictured being pushed into a police car outside Velez Malaga police station) appeared before a Madrid court today, accused of neglecting their dying five-year-old son Ashya . On trial: A police van holding Brett and Naghemeh King, sweeps into the National Court in Madrid, Spain this morning ahead of their hearing - they were remanded in custody for a further 72 hours . Cancer sufferer: Terminally ill boy, Ashya, five, was found alive by police in Spain but is under police guard in hospital and his family are banned from seeing him . He and his wife, who have seven children, made it to Spain but were arrested and hauled before an extradition court in Madrid after British police issued a European arrest warrant. The King family’s Spanish lawyer, Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz, said: ‘The parents are so sad, they are desperate. They have been slandered and their reputation has been destroyed. ‘They are here just to help their child and to get them the best treatment possible. They didn’t abandon England. ‘They didn’t need any permission because if you are a parent you have custody. This couple love their children dearly and much of what’s been said about them is manipulations and lies.’ The lawyer said the Kings’ eldest son Danny, 23, had been allowed to see Ashya in hospital in Malaga yesterday. But another brother Naveed, 20, said none of the family were allowed to see him and a source said all visits would be banned without permission from a judge. The source said Ashya was under police guard and no visits had been approved. Naveed told Channel 4 News: ‘We’re not allowed to go and see Ashya at all. There is police standing outside his hospital room. We are not allowed to go and see him.’ He said it was the first time Ashya had been alone in hospital, adding: ‘His health may deteriorate because he’s not being entertained and [kept] happy.’ Counter-argument: Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz, laywer for British couple Brett and Naghemeh King speaks to the press outside National Court in Madrid and said the couple were victims of false detention and libel . Friends of the family have organised an online petition calling on Mr Cameron to help the family. By 8pm last night more than 48,000 people had signed it. A public appeal for donations to pay for Ashya’s treatment at a private clinic in Prague had also raised more than £10,000. The Proton Therapy Centre there said it would consider Ashya for treatment immediately if he was eligible, but it would have to be approved by his doctors in Britain or Spain. It confirmed his father had contacted the clinic on August 20 to request the treatment for his tumour, known as a medulloblastoma. Treatment of paediatric tumours at the centre typically costs up to £65,000. Defence: Naveed King said his parents ensured his brother Ashya had exactly the same resources available to him at hospital when they took him to Spain, including this chargeable power-chord for his feeding line . Mr King, who runs a property management company, was said to have researched the clinic online before asking doctors at Southampton General Hospital to refer Ashya there for treatment. In a video blog posted on YouTube before his arrest he said he had pleaded for the proton beam therapy but said doctors said it would not help Ashya’s type of tumour. Mr Diaz said: ‘They will be taking legal action against the doctors who libelled him [Mr King] in the hospital and they will file a criminal complaint for false detention and libel.’ Southampton General Hospital’s medical director Dr Michael Marsh said the hospital had referred patients for proton therapy but it was not suitable for every case. He added: ‘We very much regret the communication and relationship with the King family had broken down. Our first concern is for Ashya’s welfare.’ Mr and Mrs King are expected to appear before the Audiencia National – Spain’s central criminal court – in Madrid again on Thursday to learn if they will be extradited back to Britain. Both are Jehovah’s Witnesses but their family insists their beliefs have not influenced their actions. British police have travelled to Spain and yesterday defended the decision to have the couple arrested.

"A toddler survived thanks only to a ‘miracle’ after suffering a severe allergic reaction to Nurofen, her parents said yesterday. Macey Marsh’s face broke out in scores of agonising sores and blisters after being given a child’s dose of the painkiller on the recommendation of her GP. She spent ten days in intensive care with her eyes glued together by mucus as doctors warned her terrified parents, Matt and Sarah, that even if she did live, she might lose her sight. Scroll down for video . Macey Marsh, pictured left before the incident, suffered a horrific allergic reaction to a dose of Nurofen for Children. Doctors warned her parents she was unlikely to survive after her entire body began to blister . To her parents' relief, Macey pulled through after nine days, but may still have permanent damage to her sight . Macey's father said: 'There were times when we were unsure if our little girl would pull through at all, let alone with her eyesight intact' But to their overwhelming relief, she recovered and reopened her eyes after nine days. Now they must wait to discover if she has been left with permanent damage to her sight. The youngster was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a sometimes fatal condition caused by a violent allergic reaction to a virus or a medication. Mr Marsh, 37, a photographer of Chertsey, Surrey, said: ‘The thought of  losing her was just unbearable. We hit rock bottom. ‘Doctors explained her eyes may have started attaching to the inside of her eyelids and her corneas could be so severely damaged she may never see again. It was terrifying. ‘It’s an awful condition, you’re lucky to survive it. ‘She was still blind and her skin was blistering all over her body.’ Her parents Sarah and Matt (pictured before the incident) had taken her to the local GP surgery when she appeared unwell. There, a locum GP prescribed the Nurofen for Children . After nine days of fighting for her life, Macey opened her eyes. A spokesperson for Nurofen said the reaction the toddler had suffered was extremely rare . The family’s nightmare began six weeks ago, when the couple took their daughter to their GP because she had a rash and puffy eyes. A locum told them she was ‘run down’ and advised taking Nurofen alternated with Calpol. When her parents checked on her the morning after giving the medicine, her eyes were stuck shut with mucus. Stevens . Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a severe adverse reaction to a medication. It . was named after two U.S paediatricians who described it in 1922. The condition is incurable and 40 per cent of people who contract the condition do not survive. It affects around two people per million and is more common among women. Symptoms include skin rashes, blisters in the mouth, ears and nose and swelling of the eyelids. If left untreated the condition can result in death. Possible complications include permanent blindness and lung damage. Once diagnosed doctors will immediately stop the patient taking the offending drug. Treatment includes IV fluids and high calorie formulas  to promote healing. Antibiotics are given when necessary to prevent secondary infections such as sepsis. Pain medications such as morphine can make the patient more comfortable. They took her to A&E where scarlet . fever was diagnosed and she was sent away with penicillin. The next . morning, her face was covered in blisters that were starting to burst . and she was in agony. Her mother, a BA stewardess, called an ambulance and Macey was treated . by infectious diseases experts at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, South . London who diagnosed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. She was given . morphine and moved to intensive care. Her parents said they were told it . would be a miracle if she survived. Thankfully, she recovered after . nine days. ‘Words cannot describe what that was like,’ Mrs Marsh told . the Daily Mirror. Mr Marsh said: ‘We’ve still got a very long road . ahead of us and it could take another year for her face to heal . properly. Luckily, she’s starting to act like her own bubbly self . again.’ The condition, which affects one in 500,000 children and young . adults, was named after two US paediatricians. SJS causes the cells in . the top layer of the skin to die before shedding. A spokesman for . Nurofen said: ‘We are very sorry to hear about Macey Marsh’s condition . and we wish her a swift and full recovery. ‘Stevens-Johnson Syndrome . is an extremely rare but known reaction to a multitude of triggers such . as infections, medications or illness. ‘The exact cause for the reaction is currently unknown and the reaction is unpredictable.’ She . said that although ibuprofen, the active ingredient in Nurofen for . Children, has been associated with rare cases of the syndrome, there is . no confirmed causal link.","Macey Marsh was prescribed a child's dose of the drug last month .

"A jet skier who saved the life of a little girl when she drifted half-a-mile out to sea on a boogie board says he only did what anyone else would have done. Tony Barraclough was on the beach at Rozel, Jersey, when he heard Rebecca Chambers, the girl's mother, frantically screaming. The 52-year-old hopped onto his jet ski and found little Jemima relaxing on her boogie board half-a-mile from the shore. Scroll down for video . Saved: Jemima Chambers, four, had no idea she drifted half-a-mile out when she fell asleep on her body board . 'I was putting the jet ski back on the trailer when I heard a woman shouting ""Where is she?""' he said. 'I . just told the woman to trust me, and that we would find her. The mother . jumped on the back of the jet ski with me and we headed out of the . harbour. 'I just did what anyone would have done. 'I'm no hero. 'When the mother said ""I don’t know how to thank you’ I just told her ‘don’t let it happen again.""' The Virgin Atlantic pilot added: 'She was a hell of a long way out. 'She was four years old and couldn’t exactly wave for help. 'She would have been even further out if we hadn’t got to her when we did. 'Thankfully . the jet ski is so fast we were able to find her and get her out really . quickly. She was oblivious to what was going on.' Relief: Her mother Rebecca (pictured) panicked as she looked back at the shore to see Jemima was missing . Desperate search: The family raised the alarm on Rozel Bay, Jersey. A jet skier powered out to sea to find her . Mrs Chambers lost sight of the . four-year-old when she went swimming in the sea, leaving her daughter in . the shallow water with her siblings and cousins. When she returned, the child was a speck on the horizon after drifting off on the board. When Mr Barraclough and Mrs Chambers reached her, Jemima was oblivious to how far she'd gone. Jemima and her three siblings spent three nights . staying with their aunt Rachel Le Marquand and her two children at her . home in Jersey last week. The . families had spent most of Wednesday afternoon playing in the sea at . Rozel Bay when the women decided to swim around the harbour. But . when they returned to where Jemima had been playing with cousins Emily, . ten, Jamie, six, and siblings Mollie, eight, Caspar, six, and Bruno, . two, they realised she was missing. Mrs . Chambers, from Ashleworth, Gloucestershire, said: ‘I was only gone a . short while and as I came back I realised Jemima wasn’t with the others . on the shore line. ‘I asked . the children where she was and they all pointed at this speck on the . horizon. It honestly just looked like a buoy which was floating out at . sea. She had gone well beyond the sea wall and out really far. Playing around: Jemima (pictured on a previous holiday) had been playing in the sea with her five cousins . Water baby: The four-year-old, from Gloucester, loves body boarding in Jersey, where her family lives . ‘It . was amazing. This man just appeared by my side as I was starting to . panic and before I knew what had happened I was on the back of his jet . ski, off towards her. ‘My . heart rate is still coming down from it all. I still can’t believe how . lucky we were.’ She said Jemima had not realised how much danger she was . in. ‘She thought she . hadn’t gone that far, when we got there I saw her eyes widen when she . realised just how far the shore line was. ‘It . could have been a lot worse had she realised how far out she was, she . could have panicked, lost her board and who knows what might have . happened. ‘She was never in . any difficulty, I think she was just in a very relaxed state, she had . her board, a life jacket and a wetsuit on. ‘I . think the combination of high tides and strong sea winds swept her out . that far. It apparently happened in a matter of minutes, one minute she . was there, the next she wasn’t.’ Appeal: The family, from Gloucester, are now appealing to find the jet skier that saved Jemima in Rozel Bay, Jersey, so they can thank him . Mrs Chambers said she now regrets leaving the children alone, albeit for just a few minutes. ‘I . think I was lulled into a false sense of security because they were . just paddling in the really shallow water,’ she said. ‘In hindsight, . because of that I made the poor decision to go for a swim myself and my . attention was not as focused as it should have been. ‘I . don’t think Jemima’s realised the full impact of what could have . happened, she was more excited about the jet ski ride. That was the . highlight of her holiday. We are so thankful to that man, it could have . been so much worse if it hadn’t been for him. ‘I . realised when I got back to the shore and made sure she was OK ... I . never thanked him properly. I’d love to be able to do that.’ Mrs . Le Marquand, 43, who lives on Jersey, said: ‘We spotted this dot off . the headland – we couldn’t even make out it was a body but it was her. ‘She’d floated right around the corner, far too far out to swim. ‘Luckily, . there was a man on a jet ski nearby. He didn’t shout at us for being . bad parents – he jumped on his jet ski with my sister and zoomed off. ‘I . don’t think the kids really realised quite how serious the situation . was. They were in fits of giggles and thought it was marvellous that . their mummy was on a jet ski.’ No . one is sure how far Jemima would have been swept out had she not been . rescued so quickly, but her shaken mother said ‘the tide and the current . were definitely against her’. She added that although there had been a lifeguard on duty, ‘he was a little way from where we were’. Mrs . Chambers is a qualified paediatrician who now looks after her children . full-time. Her husband, Mungo, a cosmetic surgeon, was at work while his . family were at the seaside.","Tony Barraclough saved four-year-old Jemima Chambers when she drifted .

"Injured veterans have said huge delays in receiving compensation from the Ministry of Defence are like a ‘form of torture’. Some former servicemen are still waiting three years after their claim was lodged, they said yesterday. One veterans’ group said the average waiting time for its members had increased nearly threefold since 2010. Injuries: Some former servicemen are still waiting for compensation from the Ministry of Defence three years after their claim was lodged, they said yesterday (file picture) It recently emerged the Government has paid nearly £20million in compensation to Iraqi civilians since 2003. The MoD insisted such claims are handled completely separately. It said it takes four to five months to receive payments for injury, illness or death caused while in service. Former RAF Sergeant Alex Ford dismissed this as farcical, calling the delays ‘a little form of torture’. Mr Ford served in Afghanistan and suffered a slipped disc. He left two years ago to care for his wife, a staff sergeant, who also hurt her back. Veteran Ian Bleakley, 46, said his life has been put on hold after almost a year waiting for compensation. Ian Bleakley in Iraq during the first Gulf War . The former Lance Bombardier in the Royal Artillery has had 11 operations since a shell fell off an arms truck on to his shoulder during the first Gulf War. He had to be signed off his job at the Child Support Agency last year as a result of post-traumatic stress. He said: ‘Things took a nosedive with my PTSD. I’ve never been in a darker place.’ Mr Bleakley, who was in the Army for 13 years, applied for compensation in November but has heard nothing. He said: ‘Every day I just wait for the post. I phoned them last week and they apologised and said, “you have to understand there’s just a backlog”. ‘They said they hoped I would hear within the next four weeks but couldn’t say for certain. I’m not holding my breath. They need to take on more staff. It’s as simple as that.’ He said: ‘For anything other than a plain and simple clear-cut case, you are talking at least a year for anything to happen.’ Afghanistan veteran Chris Yates, of the Royal Engineers, is still waiting for a full review three years after a truck tailgate collapsed on him. He suffered prolapsed discs, a paralysed bladder, severe kidney damage and mental side effects. So far he has received only an interim payment of £3,000. He told the BBC: ‘The last time I phoned them I was told my claim had been passed on to a case worker, but it’s now just in another queue. ‘They said it might be weeks before I hear anything as they’re completely snowed under with thousands of backlogged cases. ‘This is my pension… There is no light at the end of the tunnel.’ The National Gulf Veterans and Families Association said official figures for 1991 Gulf War claims showed waiting times rose from 82 days in 2010 to 219 days in 2014. Labour MP Madeleine Moon said: ‘We ask people to put their lives and futures on the line. If people are injured… they should have the financial help we as a nation have covenanted to provide.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are committed to dealing with all claims as quickly as possible but it is crucial every claim is considered on a case-by-case basis. ‘We have significantly improved our processes over the last three years so the average waiting time is now around four to five months.’ The MoD has so far paid out £19.3million on claims made by Iraqis against British troops, with many more yet to be heard. An MoD spokesman said: ‘It would be wholly wrong to suggest UK veterans are left waiting while we deal with compensation claims for Iraqi veterans.’","Veterans' group: Members' average waiting time up threefold since 2010 .

"Ashya King could fly to Prague for potentially life-saving treatment as early as tonight after his parent’s were finally given permission to take the desperately ill boy out of a Spanish hospital. Brett and Naghmeh King were granted their wish by a High Court judge – eight days after they removed him from a Southampton hospital following a row with doctors and drove to Spain. The five-year-old brain tumour patient will fly by private jet to a specialist hospital in the capital of the Czech Republic as soon as possible after he was deemed in a 'perfect condition to travel'. Family lawyer Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz said today that the youngster could fly to Prague as early as tonight, Sunday, or Monday at the very latest. Scroll down for video . New hope: Brett, pictured outside the Malaga hospital with his son Danny today, and Naghmeh King were granted their wish by a High Court judge - eight days after they removed him from a Southampton hospital . Urgent treatment: Ashya's mother Naghmeh and father Brett, pictured leaving the Malaga children's hospital today, asked for the five-year-old, pictured last year, to be transferred to a private hospital 560miles away . Best course of action: Ashya's parents now hope that it is not too late for their son to get the treatment he desperately needs to prevent the cancer cells from regenerating . The family's lawyer Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz (pictured on Sky News today) said the youngster could fly to Prague as early as tonight, Sunday, or Monday at the latest and said he was in a 'perfect condition to travel' Ashya is expected to receive a course of chemotherapy at a children's hospital before being given proton beam therapy which his parents believe will give him the best chance of survival. The lawyer said: ‘We’ve got the judge’s order. We’re very happy. It’s wonderful news. We’ve got a private jet virtually ready to take Ashya out of hospital.’ He also said the brain tumour patient was in 'perfect condition' to travel at the moment and had been playing with his family and toys. Mr Justice Baker made the decision after receiving a detailed plan outlining the treatment Ashya will receive. He was also provided with evidence that the boy’s parents have enough money to pay for the treatment at the Proton Therapy Centre and travel costs. The extraordinary development came hours after Ashya’s family were effectively ‘held hostage’ by a Spanish hospital which refused to release him. His parents asked for him to be moved from the state institution to a private hospital 560miles away so he could start chemotherapy. 'Overjoyed': Ashya in hospital with his mother Naghmeh. The five-year-old will fly by private jet to a specialist hospital in Prague as soon as possible to start a course of proton beam therapy . The children’s hospital in Malaga treating Ashya had refused to allow him to leave without permission from the British courts, telling his parents: ‘He’s going nowhere.’ August 28: Brett and Naghmeh King wheel their Ashya out of Southampton General hospital after disagreements over his care. Family flee to Spain. Six hours later, hospital alerts Hampshire police. August 29: Police warn ‘time is running out’ for Ashya as he needs specialist equipment. He becomes a ‘ward of court’ in the UK. August 30: European Arrest Warrant issued. Members of the public spot the family. The parents are arrested and Ashya is taken to a children’s hospital in Malaga. August 31: Ashya’s brother Naveed posts a YouTube video denying neglect. Southampton hospital claims that it offered the family a second opinion. Parents appear at a Malaga court before being transferred to Madrid. September 1: Parents told they will stay in custody after they refuse to be extradited. September 2: Kings freed after arrest warrant dropped. September 3: Ashya and his parents are reunited. Kings are told they must submit Ashya’s treatment plan for approval by  doctors. A charity agrees to cover the cost of proton beam therapy. September 4: Negotiations continue over Ashya’s treatment. September 5: Ashya was due to fly out to Prague for treatment after a judge agreed to allow his parents to take him there. Meanwhile, the family’s lawyer stoked up bad feeling by saying that a British court had no right to decide the boy’s future because it did not have jurisdiction in Spain. As pressure to resolve the impasse mounted, Mr Justice Baker held a telephone conference with lawyers yesterday afternoon to thrash out a resolution. Ashya’s parents now hope that it is not too late for their son to get the treatment he desperately needs to prevent the cancer cells from regenerating. The couple want him to have proton beam therapy rather than traditional radiotherapy. Last week they fled to the south of Spain where they were arrested following a manhunt and forced to spend three nights in separate cells in a Madrid prison. Following a national outcry, they were released and reunited with their son. As he is still a ward of court, the parents had to submit a care plan to doctors at Southampton General yesterday. Ashya’s grandmother said: ‘At 4pm yesterday, we’d lost all hope. Now, he’s on his way to Prague.’ Patricia King added: ‘We’re overjoyed that he’s finally getting treatment and we are so relieved.’ The seriously ill boy remains a ward of the High Court. However, this will be dropped when he reaches the Prague hospital. Experts there have studied Ashya’s records after they were sent over by the University Hospital Southampton Trust on Tuesday night. The treatment is likely to cost between £60,000 and £65,000. The Proton Therapy Centre claims its therapy is less than half the price of comparable treatment in the US. Family lawyer Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz had said that the decision to make Ashya a ward of the court had ‘no validity under international law’ because he is in Spain and not Britain. ‘The High Court can say it’s got custody but Ashya is in Spain and under international law it can’t execute the ward of court power,’ he said. Pioneering: The treatment room at the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague, where Ashya is expected to arrive to begin the treatment which is not available on the NHS . Next stop? Tonight it remained unclear whether the boy was flying straight to the private clinic in Prague (pictured) or was stopping off at the Clinica Universidad de Navarra, in Pamplona, northern Spain . Earlier Mr Diaz said: ‘Ashya  will be going to a private clinic in Navarra. His parents are very happy with the doctors they have contacted, with the treatment that has been proposed and with the results of that treatment.’ A source at the Malaga hospital said: ‘The director of the Materno-Infantil Hospital received a formal request for Ashya’s transfer to Navarra Hospital. We have replied saying his parents must obtain the permission of the High Court first and until that happens, he’s going nowhere.’ The source said the hospital was puzzled by the request for the move to the private Navarra facility because the family would have to pay for treatment it was currently getting for free.","Parents Brett and Naghmeh King granted their wish by a High Court judge .

"The father of Ashya King yesterday claimed British authorities threatened to remove his son for 11 years after he challenged doctors over his treatment. Brett King said he fled abroad with his wife and seriously ill child after being warned that the youngster would be taken away until he was 16 with no contact with his parents or siblings. He made the claim as his son was stretchered out of a pioneering cancer treatment centre in the Czech Republic clutching a teddy bear after doctors found no immediate signs of cancer regrowth since recent surgery on his brain tumour. Scroll down for video . Five-year-old Ashya leaves the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague clutching a teddy bear after doctors found no immediate signs of cancer regrowth since the most recent surgery on his tumour . British doctors opposed the plan to take Asha to the Prague clinic, saying it was not suitable for his condition, but the family disagreed and sparked an international manhunt when they removed him from hospital without permission and took him to the continent. Mr King said: ‘They said to me if I question anything and ask questions as a father…they would take my son away from me, not just for the treatment but until he was 16. ‘I wouldn’t be able to see my son for 11 years. ‘I said to my wife this is something so serious that our son could be taken away until he is 16. ‘Eleven years without us, he wouldn’t know his parents, his brothers, his sisters or anyone. ‘We knew we couldn’t let that happen. ‘We couldn’t question them any more. We couldn’t let them know our feelings because one mistake on our side and they’d take him away.’ His father Brett King speaks to the media after leaving the specialist treatment centre in the Czech Republic . Inside he spoke to doctors in a planning room where the preparations for his treatment were discussed . Ashya’s parents removed him from Southampton General Hospital without the permission of doctors late last month and took him to Southern Spain where they planned to sell a holiday home to fund the alternative treatment. University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust have repeatedly said they absolutely refute the suggestion that the King family was threatened. After being tracked down they were arrested and thrown into a Spanish jail for three nights. They were released following a public outcry and reunited with Ashya who had been removed and put into a hospital in Malaga. This week they succeeded in transferring him to Prague where he is due to start full treatment at the Proton Therapy Centre next week. As part of the preparations he was yesterday put under general anaesthetic and measured for a specialist cocoon pouch and had an MRI scan. Mr King leans over his son to kiss him on the cheek as they arrived at the centre this morning . Ashya previously had major surgery to remove a brain tumour on 24 July and a further operation on his brain on 22 August. Mr King said outside the Prague clinic: ‘The good news is that there is no visible signs that he has any regrowth of cancer. ‘We will find out in the next couple of days with a spinal tap if there is any microscopic cancer in his fluids, but we are hoping not.’ He said the proton beam machine his son would be treated with looked like ‘something like Nasa’. Ashya’s parents had opposed the British doctors plans for traditional radiotherapy, preferring proton treatment which they believe is more accurate and has fewer side-effects. Mr King and his wife Naghemeh were warned that their son could have been taken away from them for 11 years if they questioned any decisions made by the authorities . Mr King said: ‘As a father I was not prepared for any other treatment, treatment that would be so strong it would be worse than the illness itself. I have complete confidence here that they will give my son the best possible start. This is all we wanted for him from the beginning. ‘If a child needs treatment they should give them the treatment. It’s not for the parents to say the hospital should do it.’ Portsmouth City Council have offered support to the family to help educate the couple’s other school age children who are currently still in Spain while their parents look after Ashya. Mr King said: ‘I don’t want to get into any more trouble for my children being out of school. ‘We have told the English authorities that they are not being schooled in England and that we are exploring other avenues of either going to school here in Prague or in Spain.’","Brett King said his son could have been removed from them for 11 years .

"Campaigner: Actress Angelina Jolie . When celebrities lend their names to a good cause, it rarely fails to attract some welcome publicity. The trouble is, the main beneficiaries are usually the stars themselves, according to a study by British academics. And while only a cynic would suggest they are motivated by anything more than a selfless desire to help others, their efforts do little to make people remember the charity they are supporting. Instead, the study found, appearing altruistic makes stars such as Angelina Jolie, Robbie Williams and Emma Watson more popular. Two thirds of people could not link any celebrity with a list of seven well-known charities and aid organisations that they supported, the research found. And most who donate do so because of personal or family connections to the issues, not because of the stars supporting them. Many charities and aid groups now rely heavily on celebrities to help promote their cause. Miss Jolie is the face of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, which campaigns to combat rape in conflicts. Harry Potter actress Miss Watson was recently appointed a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and Williams helped launch Soccer Aid, which raises funds for Unicef. But the research concluded that even though celebrities are doing it for the right reasons, they ‘often do better’ out of the attention than their causes. Professor Dan Brockington, of the University of Manchester, and Professor Spencer Henson, of Sussex University, said: ‘Our survey found that while awareness of major NGO brands was high, awareness of celebrity advocates for those brands was low.’ The seven organisations mentioned in the survey of 2,000 people included Christian Aid, Action Aid, Amnesty International and the Red Cross. Jane Cooper, of Unicef UK, said: ‘Celebrities have a unique ability to reach millions of people, many of whom may not normally be engaged.’ Singer Robbie Williams has several charitable achievements under his belt, including helping launch Soccer Aid which raises funds for Unicef .","Study found that celebrities who do charity 'often do better' out of attention .

"Injured veterans yesterday claimed huge delays in receiving compensation from the Ministry of Defence was like a ‘form of torture’. Servicemen described suffering ‘mental anguish’ after sometimes still being left waiting for full payouts three years after their claim was lodged because of the backlog. One veterans' group said average times for cases to be processed for its members had increased nearly threefold since 2010. Injured veterans yesterday claimed huge delays in receiving compensation from the Ministry of Defence was like a 'form of torture' (stock picture) Criticism of the delays comes after it was revealed that that the government has been forced to pay nearly £20million in compensation to Iraqi civilians since 2003. The MOD said the Iraqi claims were handled completely separately from veterans. The MoD insisted that waiting times for injured servicemen have improved and are now around four to five months for payments for injury, illness or death caused while in service. But former RAF Sgt Alex Ford dismissed this as ‘farcical’. ‘For anything other than a plain and simple clear-cut case you are talking at least a year for anything to happen,’ he told the BBC. ‘It adds to the whole mental anguish of it, you literally have no timescale. ‘You don't know when the case is going to be resolved and you're left wondering about the postman each day... ‘You think, ‘maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow?’ Afghanistan veteran Sgt Ford suffered a slip disc during his 25 years in the RAF. He left the service two years ago to look after his wife who also hurt her back whilst serving as a staff sergeant. The couple have both suffered forms of depression. Afghanistan veteran Chris Yates, from the Royal Engineers, is still waiting for his case to be fully reviewed three years after a truck tailgate gave way and collapsed on him while on duty. He suffered a prolapsed discs, a paralysed bladder, severe kidney damage and mental side effects including depression. Labour MP Madeleine Moon, who sits on the defence select committee, said it was 'offensive' for the government to suggest a 'claiming culture' had caused the backlog . So far he has only received an interim payment of £3,000. He told the BBC: ‘The last time I phoned them I was told my claim had been passed on to a case worker, but it's now just in another queue. ‘They said it might be weeks before I hear anything as they're completely snowed under with thousands of backlogged cases. ‘I was medically discharged in April 2014, so this is my pension that hasn't been sorted. ‘All my income has stopped and I'm not able to work. ‘There is no light at the end of the tunnel... Everything has been taken out of my hands.’ The National Gulf Veterans and Families Association said official figures it had been provided about claims relating to the 1991 Gulf War showed the average waiting had jumped from 82 days in 2010 to 219 days in 2014. Labour MP Madeleine Moon, who sits on the defence select committee, said it was ‘offensive’ for the government to suggest a ‘claiming culture’ had caused the backlog. She said: ‘We ask people to put their lives and futures on the line, the work that they do is tough. 'If people are injured, if people's lives are changed that dramatically that they need financial compensation to be able to deal with the day-to-day grind of living with an injury, they should have the financial help that we as a nation have covenanted to provide.’ An MoD spokeswoman said: ‘We are committed to dealing with all claims as quickly as possible but it is crucial that every claim is considered on a case by case basis. ‘These claims are often complex and may require additional information from third party groups so it can take time to ensure everyone gets the compensation they need. ‘Last year we dealt with around 36,000 claims and we have significantly improved our processes over the last three years so that the average waiting time is now around 4-5 months.’ The MoD has paid £19.3million compensation for personal injury claims made by Iraqis against British troops for the five years our forces were in Iraq after 2003. The average handout to each of the 321 individuals is £60,000 with many more claims yet to be heard. The MoD said complaints civil claims from Iraqi civilians were dealt with by a completely different department and should not be compared. A spokeswoman said: ‘It would be wholly wrong to suggest that UK veterans are left waiting while we deal with compensation claims for Iraqi veterans. That simply isn’t what is happening.’","One veterans' group said average times had increased threefold since 2010 .

"Startling: Details of the alleged case were revealed in a letter to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan . A successful Christian school could face closure after failing to invite religious leaders from other faiths to speak to pupils, it has been reported. The school is under threat of being downgraded by Ofsted inspectors for breaching new rules designed to promote ‘British values’ such as tolerance and individual liberty. They were introduced in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal, where Birmingham schools were infiltrated by hardline Muslim groups. The Christian Institute, which is giving legal support to the small independent school in the Home Counties, has written to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan disclosing the details of the case, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph. The group expressed fears that there are ‘disturbing consequences’ for religious schools which are falling foul of measures intended to combat extremism. Inspectors are understood to have warned the head that the school, which was previously rated as ‘good’, that it would be downgraded to ‘adequate’ for failing to meet standards requiring it to ‘actively promote’ harmony between different faiths because it had failed to bring in representatives from other religions. They warned that unless the school could demonstrate how it was going to meet the new requirements, there would be a further full inspection which could, in a worst case scenario, lead to it being closed. It was among 40 schools across the country given lightning inspections last month in the aftermath of findings that Islamists had imposed strict religious practices on Birmingham state schools. Ofsted rules state that inspectors must ‘consider the effectiveness of safeguarding arrangements’ including ‘the approach to keeping pupils safe from the dangers of radicalisation and extremism’. The Christian Institute – which is planning a legal challenge to the consultation, arguing that it was rushed through – fears the new guidelines could be used to clamp down on the teaching of anything deemed politically incorrect on issues such as marriage. Scroll down for video . Simon Calvert, deputy director of the Institute, reportedly told Mrs Morgan: ‘Worryingly, evidence is already emerging of how the new regulations are requiring Ofsted inspection teams to behave in ways which do not respect the religious ethos of faith schools. ‘The new requirements are infringing the rights of children, parents, teachers and schools to hold and practise their religious beliefs.’ The letter was by the Christian Institute's Simon Calvert (pictured). The school's identity was not revealed . Listing recent cases involving criticism of Anglican, Roman Catholic and Jewish schools by Ofsted, he added: ‘The Christian Institute is currently working with an independent Christian School which has been marked down by Ofsted for not promoting other faiths. ‘Astonishingly it was told it should invite representatives of other faith groups to lead assemblies and lessons, such as an imam. The wording of the regulations inevitably results in these kind of outcomes. ‘While we obviously support attempts to address the problem of radicalisation, the current regulations fail to do this.’ A Department for Education spokesman said last night: ‘The Independent School Standards are designed to ensure every school prepares children for life in modern Britain. We make no apology for demanding high standards and the promotion of tolerance and respect of all faiths and cultures. ‘We have received a letter from the Christian Institute’s legal representatives and are considering our response.’","Details of case revealed in complaint letter to the Education Secretary .

"Empire: Fergus and Judith Wilson announced yesterday they are offering their entire, 1,000-home portfolio for sale . Britain's biggest buy-to-let landlords are expected to pocket £250million after putting their property empire on the market. Fergus and Judith Wilson announced yesterday they are offering their entire portfolio of nearly 1,000 homes to whoever pays ‘top dollar’. Former maths teacher Mr Wilson said he would be ‘broken-hearted’ to let go of the empire he has built up around Kent’s M20 corridor since 1992, at one point buying homes at the rate of one a day. But the 65-year-old has suggested he might launch a political career by standing as police commissioner for Kent, despite a recent conviction for hitting an estate agent. He was criticised earlier this year after saying he preferred to let his properties to Eastern European migrants as they were less likely to default on rent payments than Britons on benefits. Only a year ago he insisted he had no plans to sell his portfolio, which is mainly in Ashford and Maidstone, after surviving the property crash during the recession. But yesterday he said: ‘We are selling up the whole lot. The market has recovered and passed the 2007 level. ‘An intermediary is handling it. Is it China money, Indian money, Saudi money? We will see. I am sure there will be much interest. 'I would like it to end up in English hands but it is a case of who will pay top dollar.’ He pledged that existing tenants will be protected, with their rental contracts switched to the company or landlord that buys the portfolio. ‘I will be broken-hearted to say goodbye to my property portfolio but I cannot take it with me. It has been a lot of fun over the years,’ he added. Homes on the Park Farm estate in Ashford, where the Wilsons own scores of two and three-bed properties, are worth around £185,000, up £35,000 from their 2009 low. The couple, who have two daughters, live in a £2million home near Maidstone, which doubles as an office. Scroll down for video . For sale: The white house is one of the properties they have bought around the M20 corridor in Kent since 1992 . Twenty-two stone Mr Wilson was fined more than £1,500 at Folkestone Magistrates’ Court in April after being convicted of attacking an estate agent following a dispute about a boiler. He is appealing. And he told his local paper last month he would consider standing as Kent’s police and crime commissioner if the embattled incumbent, Ann Barnes, quits. He had put himself up as an independent candidate for the role in 2012 but pulled out before the election. Mr Wilson said yesterday that after selling up he would be prepared to help the Government on housing policy but only if they ‘pay me enough money’.","Fergus and Judith Wilson have built up the empire in Kent's M20 corridor .

"Rebecca Jones, 30, was arrested over the falsification of medical records at Labour-run healthcare trust . A nurse yesterday admitted neglecting nine vulnerable patients in a scandal-hit Labour-run healthcare trust. Rebecca Jones, 30, was arrested over the falsification of medical records as part of what is thought to be the biggest criminal investigation into alleged harm and neglect of patients at an NHS hospital. Fourteen staff have been suspended from the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales as part of the ongoing probe into neglect. Families of patients have alleged that failings are even worse than the Mid Staffordshire Hospital Trust scandal because of the attempts to ‘supress’ wrongdoing. Jones admitted wilfully neglecting nine patients ‘lacking capacity’ between February 2012 and February 2013. One of the mistreated patients was mother-of-five Lilian Williams, 82, who died in 2012 after a string of failings. An inquiry found she was denied life-saving medication, allowed to starve for days and left in agony because her prosthetic leg was not taken off at night. Under devolution, the NHS in Wales is controlled by Labour rather than the Coalition based in Westminster, and at the time of the failings, the trust’s board was chaired by a former Labour MP, Win Griffiths. When Labour’s first minister in Wales, Carwyn Jones, was alerted to the scandal of poor nursing standards at the trust, his government waited over a year to order an investigation. Jones sat in the dock at Cardiff Crown Court alongside fellow nurses Lauro Bertulano, 45, and Clare Cahill, 41, who are also charged with wilfully neglecting patients but have yet to enter pleas. Prosecutor Catherine Richards told the court: ‘The allegations against nurse Bertulano relate to some of the same patients as Jones. ‘It is an unusual case but we are not alleging any joint enterprise or collusion.’ All three nurses allegedly failed to check patient’s blood glucose levels and then falsified official hospital notes to cover up the mistake. The nurses, who were working on a specialist ward that dealt mostly with stroke patients, are currently suspended from their jobs. The three, from Bridgend, South Wales, worked at the 548-bed Princess of Wales Hospital which has also been heavily criticised over patient waiting times and quality of care. The Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales where Rebecca Jones worked as a nurse . An independent report found a ‘lack of suitably qualified, educated and motivated staff.’ Peter Walsh, chief executive of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said: ‘We have heard from a number of people with serious concerns about care at the hospital.’ One of the mistreated patients, mother-of-five Lilian Williams, 82, who died in 2012 after string of failings . All three nurse were released on bail on the condition they do not contact any nursing staff or visiting the hospital unless for specific medical treatment. Judge Eleri Rees said she would sentence Jones at a later date depending on whether other nurses plead guilty or are charged with similar offences coming from the police investigation. Judge Rees said: ‘At least one defendant has faced up to their responsibility to the matters and I make no comment about any of the others.’ Earlier this year it emerged that Welsh cancer patients are flooding into English hospitals for treatment they are being denied at home. The number crossing the border has quadrupled from just 3,471 a decade ago to 15,450 last year, fuelled by a lack of access to the National Cancer Drugs Fund and longer waits for vital scans.","Rebecca Jones, 30, was arrested over the falsification of medical records .

"Under new sugar guidelines, women would be restricted to five teaspoons  a day and men seven teaspoons . Officials are urging people to halve their sugar intake to as little as five teaspoons a day to prevent obesity levels continuing to soar. But they have been accused of failing to take proper action against the food industry to  help the public meet the strict targets. Guidelines from scientists advising Public Health England, the agency given the job of tackling obesity, yesterday stated that women should have no more than five to six teaspoons of sugar a day, and men seven to eight. A 330ml can of fizzy drink contains around seven teaspoonfuls, so would meet this limit on its own. Currently, Britons consume an average of 15 teaspoons daily, mainly due to the high volumes of sugar hidden in everyday items such as fruit juice, muesli, yoghurts, sandwiches and ready meals. As reported in yesterday’s Mail, experts are advising parents to ban fruit juice, squash and soft drinks from the dinner table and give their children only water and milk. Senior doctors and academics want the Government to force food manufacturers to cut sugar levels, ensure products are clearly labelled and impose a tax on soft drinks. But Public Health England merely said it would ‘consider’ these ideas as part of a nine-month consultation process that will eventually report to ministers next spring. PHE simply issued a document suggesting a number of ideas the Government could consider to help the public meet these targets. These included fruit juice  and smoothies being banned  from the five-a-day fruit and  vegetable guidelines because they are so high in sugar. The organisation – set up last year to tackle public health issues – also said it would ‘explore further approaches’ such as adding a tax to soft drinks and banning junk food adverts before the 9pm watershed. Other plans include discouraging supersize portions at coffee chains, fast food outlets and cinemas. But ministers last night remained non-committal and said the PHE document would help ‘inform’ the debate about sugar. Around one in four adults are considered obese although this is predicted to rise to half the population by 2050, driving up levels of diabetes and heart disease. Campaigners accused the officials of not doing enough to tackle the obesity epidemic. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘This is all delaying tactics. We’ve had delaying tactics from this government for years. They’re not going far enough. ‘We need tough, firm action with the industry. They need to take immediate action rather than sitting on the fence yet again.’ Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist at Croydon Hospitals, South London, said: ‘This doesn’t address the availability of sugar everywhere. The food industry have not made any promises to reduce sugar. ‘We want this to be translated into something that’s meaningful for the public. We want them to slash their sugar levels by 40 per cent within four years.’ The Government has been accused of ‘cosying-up’ to the food industry and in so doing, failing to address the obesity epidemic. Too much sugar in the diet is known to be one of the primary reasons for the obesity epidemic and rising rates of Type 2 diabetes . Its flagship obesity policy, the . responsibility deal, allows food firms to set their own targets for . cutting sugar, salt and fat and for clearly stating the number of . calories that products contain. It . has already emerged that five of the seven members of the Scientific . Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which drew up yesterday’s guidelines on . sugar, have financial ties to the food industry. They . include the chairman, Ian MacDonald, professor of metabolic physiology . at Nottingham University, who has worked as a paid adviser for Coca-Cola . and Mars and whose research has been funded by Unilever, the world’s . biggest producer of ice cream. Others . include a consultant for the world’s largest chocolate producer, Barry . Callebaut, and scientists whose research has been funded by Unilever. Public . Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ‘We want to help people make . healthier choices and get the nation into healthy habits.

"You may be admiring your tan after a glorious weekend – but don’t get too attached to it. For we have just a 25 per cent chance of enjoying a sizzling summer, the Met Office claimed last night. Forecasters made a series of predictions based on weather models. Don't get used to it: Londoners were enjoying the sun near to Tower Bridge on Monday, but the hot weather is not likely to last, says Met Office . They said there is just a one in four chance of temperatures being above average from this month to August. Above average is defined as any temperature higher than 15C (59F). And the odds of a particularly dry summer, with less than 175mm of rain, were just 15 per cent, making drizzly weather more likely. The said average temperatures for the summer months were likely to range from lows of 10C / 50F to highs of 18C / 64F. The average rainfall from June to August is set to be 241mm.Thankfully the odds of a particularly cold summer, below 13.75C / 55F, are low at 10 per cent. Go while you can: Forecasters at the Met Office say there is just a one in four chance of temperatures being above average from this month to August . Tan up: Two friends sunbathe on Southsea Common, Portsmouth on Monday to make the most of the sunny weather . But the chances of it being wetter than usual, with up to 450mm of rainfall, are higher at one in five. The Met Office makes longer term forecasts to enable emergency services and other bodies to make contingency plans for extreme weather conditions. But these are harder to make with absolute accuracy. The Met Office’s 30 day outlook last night stated: ‘The weather is expected to settle down with many areas having some warm sunshine, although showers are still likely in the northwest. ‘From mid-June to early July, the indications are that the weather will be close to what is climatologically normal for this time of year – giving us a tendency for occasional spells of unsettled weather interspersed with fine and warm spells, much as we have seen recently.’ In the shorter term warm, changeable conditions are expected today and tomorrow, but will give way to sunnier weather on Thursday. Andy Ratcliffe, forecaster for Meteogroup, said: ‘These next few days will see showers with warm temperatures and breezy conditions. Later in the week will be dry and sunny as a high pressure system moves across England. ‘By the weekend the high pressure system will move south west leaving the north susceptible to more showers.’ The warmest place in the UK today is expected to be London where temperatures will reach 22C / 71F, and the coldest place will be the coast of Cumbria where temperatures will be around 15C / 59F. The wettest area today will be Powys, where 15 mm of rainfall is expected.","The summer weather is not here to stay, says Met Office forecasters .

"Failures: Dr Bijan Saha is facing sanctions after being accused of taking mobile phone calls during appointments, storing drugs dangerously and failing to respect patients' privacy . An elderly doctor is facing sanctions after being accused of taking mobile phone calls during appointments, storing drugs dangerously and failing to respect patients’ privacy. Patients described Dr Bijan Saha as ‘terrible’ and advised others to avoid his surgery ‘like the plague’. They complained the 73-year-old GP discussed private medical conditions in front of reception staff and other patients, and took personal calls during consultations. Others complained he wrote prescriptions for them before they had even described their symptoms. The surgery in Sittingbourne, Kent, where Dr Saha is the only GP, was found to have serious failings after an unannounced inspection by the Care Quality Commission. It found he was failing to meet all 11 standards that are monitored and this was having a major impact on patients. The CQC would not discuss the nature of the action it is taking for legal reasons. Patients had difficulty making appointments at the practice – which closes for five hours in the middle of each day – and were forced to use other  services such as walk-in centres. One, Brian Woodruff said he changed surgeries after his ‘awful’ experience there. The 52-year-old, who runs a dog-sitting business, said: ‘Dr Saha is just a rude man. When you went in to speak to him he had never finished his notes on the previous patient. He wouldn’t listen to anything you told him. ‘I suffered with depression and I felt he just fobbed me off with a prescription or some pills. I’ve changed doctors and feel so much better.’ Another patient said: ‘I’ve been with this surgery for 13 years and it just gets worse. What do I pay national insurance for? When I need a doctor I can’t get an appointment. When I do see the doctor, they never listen and are writing a prescription before I’ve even finished my first sentence.’ One patient said of the surgery online: ‘Twice during my consultation the doctor answered their mobile phone and from the conversation that I heard was discussing matters unconnected with the surgery. ‘I would advise anyone considering this GP practice to avoid it like the plague.’ Another said: ‘This is a terrible surgery. The staff are rude and never answer the phone.’ Complaints: Patents complained the 73-year-old GP discussed private medical conditions in front of reception staff and other patients, and took personal calls during consultations . Damningly, the report revealed: ‘Medicines were not handled appropriately or stored correctly. Medication prescribed for a named individual was being used for general administration to others. ‘Repeat prescriptions were issued without reviews, and were often printed by administrative staff. This procedure had led to a prescribing error which could have had very serious consequences. There were no formal processes to ensure security of prescription pads or stocktaking of medicines.’ Staff who chaperoned people during intimate procedures had not been give criminal records checks. In addition, the waiting area was found to be dirty, with all the waiting room chairs badly stained. Michele Golden, CQC’s head of GP inspection in the South, said: ‘The issues we have identified at Dr Saha’s practice are very serious. People using this practice are currently at unacceptable levels of risk.’ Dr Saha, who could earn up to £82,789 a year, was pictured yesterday during his five-hour break getting into his car with a personalised number plate. He said: ‘I’m extremely sorry, I don’t want to say anything.’","Patients described Dr Bijan Saha, 73, from Sittingbourne, Kent, as 'terrible'

"A murderer walked out of prison and went on the run for nine years – even claiming benefits, obtaining a passport and going abroad on holiday. The disappearance of Hell’s Angel David Richards, 53, should have triggered a  manhunt after he absconded from a Derbyshire open prison in 2005. But local police refused to look for him, leaving him free to reinvent himself as a respectable member of society. Murder victim: Michael Groves, left, with his younger brother Marcus. David Richards and his girlfriend attacked Michael with a wrench, hammer and knife before writing 'Hell's Angels' on the wall with his blood . He rented a flat, claimed thousands in benefits, went to Ireland on holiday and even complained to police that youths had been throwing stones at his window. Richards was only recaptured after the Daily Mail was tipped off about him, traced his whereabouts and spent a week urging police to act. Last night, his victim’s shocked family demanded an urgent inquiry into the farce, which raises serious questions about measures to manage dangerous offenders. Louise Bull, 42, whose 16-year-old brother, Michael Groves, was murdered by Richards, said those responsible for the ‘disgraceful failings’ should be named. She added: ‘My family were fobbed off again and again. We deserve to know what went wrong so it can never happen again.’ Richards was jailed for life with his girlfriend in 1984 for Michael’s frenzied, drug-fuelled murder at their West London flat. They attacked him with a knife, hammer and wrench, leaving him with 56 injuries. They then wrote ‘Hell’s Angels’ on the wall in his blood. Richards was sentenced to at least 16 years, but was deemed so dangerous that he was still in prison in 2005 – 21 years later. However, just months before his release, he walked out of Sudbury Prison, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, because he was stressed and fed up with being bullied, according to his parents. Instead of mounting a manhunt, Derbyshire Police merely logged his disappearance on a national database. It took no further action, even after being contacted by the Daily Mail. Instead it was left to the Met Police, which dealt with the original murder, to travel to Wolverhampton and arrest Richards. Detectives discovered the former Hell’s Angel in a flat near his parents, where the keen odd-jobber was known for helping neighbours. Richards had been able to register for disability and housing benefits, claiming he was unable to work because he has difficulty walking. His mother Patricia, 79, said: ‘As far as we were concerned, he was a free man. ‘He never hid from anyone and was even claiming disability benefits. He’s got one leg longer than the other and walks with a crutch and a stick. ‘He can’t work but he’s so helpful to everyone and he’s just a lovely, kind man. It’s ridiculous that he has been arrested after so much time. He only had a few months to serve. We thought he was free because no one came for him. ‘He’s had a passport for heaven’s sake, so he’s not exactly been lying low.’ Absconded: Just months before his release, Richards walked out of Sudbury Prison, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, because he was stressed and fed up with being bullied, according to his parents . Mrs Bull, a nurse from Fareham, Hampshire, said she was stonewalled by police when she asked what was being done to find him. In 2005, a police family liaison officer even refused to tell her which prison he walked out of because of the killer’s ‘right to privacy’. She said: ‘I’m ecstatic he’s been caught. Now I want him to serve the time he should’ve served in the first place. ‘People need to explain how this can possibly have been able to happen and those responsible for doing nothing need to be named. ‘My family got the real life sentence. He took everything away from us and we miss my brother at every special event, every family occasion. I have spent the last nine years full of anger and living in fear.’ A Met spokesman said Richards was arrested on Friday and remains in custody at a West Midlands police station. He said: ‘On Monday, June 2, the Met was contacted by the Daily Mail regarding Richards who was wanted by police having absconded from HMP Sudbury. As a result, officers attended an address in the West Midlands where Richards was subsequently arrested.’ His capture follows the disappearance of an armed robber known as the Skull Cracker, which ignited a row about open prisons. Michael Wheatley, 55, walked out of a Kent jail last month, holding up a building society in Surrey before being caught. Ministers said inmates should no longer be transferred to open conditions or allowed on temporary release if they had absconded before.","David Richards, 53, walked out of HMP Sudbury, Derbyshire, in 2005 .

The . heaviest rain is expected in Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and along . the east coast, where some parts could see a fortnight’s worth of rain . in a few hours. The Met Office also issued a yellow warning – a moderate . risk of severe weather – alerting people to potential travel chaos as . ‘heavy and persistent’ rain sweeps up the country. Officials warned households to ‘be prepared’ for possible flooding. Its . alerts, including several for  villages along rivers in the Home . Counties, said: ‘There may be some flooding of low-lying land and roads, . some disruption to travel and possibly flooding to individual . properties.’ The wet weather is due to a depression blowing in from the Continent. A . Met Office spokesman said: ‘Looking ahead through the rest of this week . there is more rain to come, particularly for eastern and north-eastern . England, while Scotland, especially the north, has the best of the warm, . sunny weather.

With . strengthening winds, this will make it feel quite unpleasant at times.’ But, it added: ‘Things should turn generally drier, brighter and warmer by the weekend.’ There . is little consolation in the Met Office UK outlook for June 2 to June . 9, updated yesterday, which warned: ‘The weather is likely to stay . changeable with showers or longer spells of rain accompanied by breezy . conditions at times, particularly across western areas at first.’ The . outlook for June 10 to 24 is hardly any more encouraging: ‘Changeable . weather looks more likely than not to persist into mid-June. ‘As . such, conditions would then be mixed with showers or longer spells of . rain, particularly for western areas, interspersed by some drier, . brighter periods for most parts of the UK.

"Victim: Mother-of-three Sabeen Thandi, 37, was forced her to wear a hijab head scarf and pressurised into an Islamic marriage by husband Mohammed Badiuzzaman . A husband who strangled to death his pregnant wife two weeks after police arrested him for threatening to kill her with a hammer was sentenced to life imprisonment today. Mohammed Badiuzzaman, 34, pleaded guilty to murdering mother-of-three Sabeen Thandi at the Old Bailey earlier this month. Before the killing he told colleagues he planned to kill his wife, bragged that UK jail was ‘easy peasy’ and ranted about Oscar Pistorius. He was today sentenced to a minimum of . 17 years in prison by Judge Christopher Moss QC, who described the . defendant as ‘manipulative, devious and controlling’. Mrs . Thandi was strangled at her home in Forest Gate, London, in July last . year, a fortnight after she obtained a restraining order against her . husband, and after police had arrested him for making death threats. Police . officers are now under investigation by the Independent Police . Complaints Commission for releasing Badiuzzaman before he went on to . kill. Badiuzzaman had forced . Mrs Thandi into a Muslim marriage and had moved in with her two months . after they began dating in November 2012. He . was controlling, preventing her from leaving the house alone, forcing . her to throw away ‘revealing’ clothes and instead wear a hijab because . otherwise she would ‘feel his wrath’. The security guard even tried to sell her home by visiting an estate agents and pretending he owned the property. Doctor’s . receptionist Mrs Thandi grew sick of Badiuzzaman’s abuse and visited . solicitors in Watford in June last year seeking a divorce. She took out an order from Watford County Court on June 17 against Badiuzzaman to prevent him from entering her home, as she feared for her children’s safety. But two days later Badiuzzaman became enraged after discovering Mrs Thandi was in love with a man in Pakistan whom she had met on Facebook, named in court as only as Majid. Badiuzzaman duped his wife into getting into the car with him on the premise of taking her to work, but instead he drove her around for three hours and threatened her. He said he had a hammer in his car boot and that if she did not revoke the order against him she would never see her son again, and that police would ‘find parts of her body in bits in bin bags’. Mrs Thandi pleaded with her solicitors to revoke the order, and they proceeded to call the police. Badiuzzaman was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill and unlawful imprisonment. While being cautioned he made no comment and grinned at police, but he was later released. Jailed: Badiuzzaman, 34, strangled his pregnant wife Sabeen Thandi to death after police arrested him for threatening her with a hammer . In the early hours of July 7 police received two silent 999 calls from the home the couple had shared and were met by Badiuzzaman at the door who said his wife was at work. He was calm and made conversation with officers but when they searched the property they found her lifeless body under a duvet in the bedroom. Badiuzzaman told police: ‘I’ve killed my wife.’ But when paramedics asked him to tell them what he had done so that they might attempt to save her, he said he did not know. Mrs Thandi was taken to Newham University Hospital where she was confirmed dead, and a post-mortem gave the cause of death as strangulation. Before the killing he had told colleagues he intended to ‘stab’ Mrs Thandi and had talked for an hour about high-profile domestic violence murder cases of Oscar Pistorius and Shrien Dewani. He told colleagues ‘they have got away with it’ and ‘jail in Britain is easy peasy’. Sentencing Judge Moss said: ‘From all that I’ve heard about you I have no doubt that you are a manipulative, devious and controlling person with a serious anger management issue. ‘It’s clear from the way in which she died that you intended that she should die. You strangled her in her bedroom in her own home.’ He added: ‘You murdered your estranged wife in her own home which you were excluded from by order of the county court. ‘It’s clear from the evidence in the case that this was an order you deserved and which you had no respect for, indeed you resented it. ‘You have deprived those children of the love and care of their mother in their formative years of their lives. You had no conceivable defence.’ The judge said he took into some account the fact that the defendant had pleaded guilty one day before the case was listed, and that he had shown some remorse, but added: ‘I suspect you feel sorrier for yourself than those affected by your actions.’ Officer in the case, Detective Inspector Euan McKeeve said: ‘We are very satisfied with the outcome of the case. Domestic violence in all its forms is totally abhorrent and cannot be tolerated. There’s likely to be some learning from the IPCC investigation, but because that investigation is ongoing I am unable to comment further at this time.’ Hertfordshire Police and the Met Police are now being investigated by the IPCC in relation to the incident. An IPCC spokesman said: ‘The investigation is nearing conclusion, with most lines of enquiry completed by investigators. ‘We have interviewed ten officers and a civilian staff member from the Metropolitan Police Service under misconduct caution, in relation to their contact with Mrs Thandi prior to her death on 7 July 2013. Two officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary have also been interviewed under misconduct caution, in relation to their contact with Mrs Thandi on 19 June 2013. ‘We have also taken statements from several independent witnesses, and are keeping the family updated on the progress of our investigation.’","Mohammed Badiuzzaman admitted killing mother-of-three Sabeen Thandi .

"British Gas staff who doubled customers’ energy bills were treated like celebrities and rewarded with luxury all-expenses paid trips including limousine and helicopter rides, whistleblowers have claimed. Employees who made the highest profits by ensuring customers were sold the most expensive deals possible were sent on holidays to places such as Monaco, Rome and Iceland. It emerged last month British Gas paid staff bonuses for inflating business customers’ bills – and churches and charities were targeted because they had fewer resources to shop around. Rewarded: Whistleblowers say employees who made the highest profits by ensuring customers were sold the most expensive deals possible were sent on holidays to places such as Monaco, Rome and Iceland . Staff have monthly targets to bring in up to £120,000 in profit each, and some exceed targets by 200 per cent. Sales agents view vulnerable customers as ‘gold dust’ because they are  easier to talk into poorer deals. After the Mail revealed the practice, energy regulator Ofgem said it would examine the evidence and take ‘firm action’ if it found British Gas had not been ‘honest and transparent’ with its customers. It can now be revealed that employees making the highest margins were flown to five-star hotels in glamorous destinations and enjoyed treats such as rally driving, gambling and limousine and helicopter rides. Their food and drink was paid for and often they were given spending money. Other rewards included vouchers, 3D TVs, laptops, theatre tickets and PlayStations. A whistleblower who won a holiday said: ‘You were treated as if you were a celebrity. They spent thousands on each person for these trips.’ Despite British Gas’s claims that its culture was changing, staff can still see their commission multiply 24 times for inflating prices, said a current employee, although luxury trips have been phased out. The employee of ten years said: ‘We are encouraged to charge as much as we can. If the customer is a charity, or someone who doesn’t speak English, they are so easy to mislead, it’s gold dust to us. British Legion is great because the volunteers are elderly. Revelation: Ofgem said it will investigate the claims revealed in the Mail last month (file photo) ‘Staff are having to be ruthless. You can’t allow for guilt if you are going to make a living. You have to adopt a hard-nosed attitude.’ Employees selling gas at base price for a one-year contract earn £18, but if they double costs to 5.5p per unit over three years they earn £435. A 3p price rise would cost the average business £1,700 more. A former employee applied these practices and said her monthly profit target was £80,000. She said: ‘I was hitting my targets by preying on vulnerable customers. ‘We’d tell those people: “This is your best price”, even though it wasn’t.’ When she asked bosses if the practices were ethical she was told ‘This is a business, this is how we operate’. Charities targeted include the Scouts, the British Legion, John Storer House Foundation – a community project – and James Smith’s Almshouse Charity – a residential home for the elderly. Stephen Beynon, British Gas Business managing director, said his company ‘utterly refutes any suggestion that contracts have been negotiated inappropriately, or that customers are misled’. He said that data analysis showed that charities were getting better than average deals. An Ofgem spokesman said: ‘We welcome this further information from the Daily Mail, and would encourage anyone with information that an energy company is not complying with our rules to get in touch.’","Whistleblowers: Those producing high profits went to Monaco and Rome .

"Cadbury is to stop selling chocolate bars aimed at individuals containing more than 250 calories as part of a government anti-obesity initiative. The former British favourite, controversially bought by American-owned confectionary firm Mondelez International in 2010, will phase out its most calorific bars as part of a drive by the Department of Health to crack down on obesity. The Dairy Milk bar and a half, Dairy Milk Whole Nut bar and a half, and Dairy Milk Fruit and Nut bar and a half, are among the products affected. These are all aimed at individuals. Axed: The Dairy Milk bar and a half (pictured) is among the products affected by the announcement . Individual bar: The Dairy Milk Whole Nut bar and a half (pictured) is also affected by the changes . No more: The Dairy Milk Fruit and Nut bar and a half (pictured) will also be phased out by Mondelez International . Family-sized bars are not affected by the change because they are meant for sharing, thus do not fall under the initiative. Earlier this year, hundreds of foods and drinks companies were asked to outline moves they will make to help people make healthier choices as part of the Department of Health’s voluntary Responsibility Deal. Mondelez said at least two other food brands it owns could be altered in size, indicating that a corresponding price decrease for those items could be on the cards. It did not say which but the company also produces popular products like Philadelphia cheese spread and Belvita breakfast biscuits. In a statement the firm said: ‘Mondelez International knows it has a part to play in helping people lead healthier lives. ‘One way do to this is to help consumers reduce their calorie intake, which is why we signed the calorie reduction pledge. ‘As . part of this pledge, we have committed that, by the end of 2015, all . our single serve (bars) confectionery products will be 250 calories or . less.’ The Department of Health’s anti-obesity deal with food firms has been criticised because it is voluntary. Alterations: Mondelez said at least two other food brands it owns could be altered in size, indicating that a corresponding price decrease for those items could happen. The Bournville site in Birmingham is pictured . As a result, Coca-Cola, Kellogg, Danone have so far ignored requests to lower the number of calories in their products. Ministers aim to cut the calories consumed in England by five billion per day. Sainsbury, Kraft Foods, Nestlé, Tate & Lyle and Unilever, have also failed to join the joint pledge on calorie reduction. Public Health Minister Jane Ellison . welcomed the food companies which did co-operate with its health . initiative, but said more efforts were needed. 'Whilst it is very encouraging to see so many companies getting behind the Responsibility Deal, we know there remains more to be done' Jane Ellison, Public Health Minister . She said: ‘Whilst it is very encouraging to see so many companies getting behind the Responsibility Deal, we know there remains more to be done. ‘We cannot credibly tackle the major public health challenges our country faces without engaging with the companies that play such a big part in people’s lives and it is vital that momentum is maintained.’ In the UK, 67 per cent of men and 57 per cent of women are either overweight or obese, according to the Global Burden of Disease study. More than one in four children are overweight or obese, and more girls are overweight than boys. In 2012 the Cadbury’s single Dairy Mail shrunk by eight per cent in size from 49g to 45g. Despite the reduction in size, the price of the bars has increased by a penny to 60p. In 2011 Cadbury reduced the size of the 140g bar of Dairy Milk to 120g, losing the equivalent of two chunks.","Dairy Milk, Whole Nut and Fruit and Nut bar and a half products affected .

"The fact that Bryan Bedder even made it to a hospital is incredible. Now able to feel his legs, doctors are astounded. The revered celebrity photographer was surfing between jobs at Art Basel in Miami on December4 when he slipped, fractured his C5 vertebrae, and fell into paralysis. But one month in bed couldn't tear him away from his camera. As part of his motor skills therapy, he has taken photographs of every single visitor who has come to his side since he was transferred to his home city of New York. Journey: Bryan Bedder was left paralyzed after he fractured his C5 vertebrae while surfing on December 4 . Documentation: As part of his rehabilitation, Bedder has photographed every visitor - mainly fellow snappers . It took days of practice to even pick up a camera. The moving shots posted to Bryan's Instagram page include numerous photographers and photojournalists, as well as his wife Shawness Prestidge, young daughter Marlow, mother, and brothers - who gave him a shave. Bryan remains in a head brace and doctors have no clear diagnosis of when or if he will fully recover. After plummeting into a sand bar on the beach, Bryan remembers taking a breath then blacking out - with his face in the water. A trip outside: Bedder's melancholic photographs capture his slow, difficult journey through photos of others . Artistic: He had been in Miami for Art Basel shooting celebrities and art for the photo company Getty Images . The other side of the lens: Many of his subjects are usually behind the lens, like photojournalist Tony Behar . Friends: Bedder has been supported by friends, including photographer Michael Loccisano, throughout . Moving: The images, such as this of painter Jimmy Sheehan, capture day to day life in the New York hospital . Each photo captures the subject plus clinical elements of the hospital, like the poster behind Mark Von Holden . Strangers spotted him and rushed to pull him out of the water, saving his life. According to Shawness, spinal surgery has helped bring feeling back to his legs. The biggest hurdle now is his hands. 'Bryan's leg movement, very suddenly came back in a big way,' Shawness wrote on Bryan's GoFundMe page. 'So we are feeling very positive about that.' Recovering: Bedder can now feel his legs after undergoing spinal surgery and rehabilitation sessions . Devoted father: He has been helped along by his young daughter Marlow, who is regularly with him in the ward . Support: His wife Shawnelle Prestidge is with him every step of the way helping him raise funds for treatment . 'Helping mom stay hydrated in Miami': This is a shot of Bedder showing his strength very soon after his fall . Brotherly love: His brothers came to visit and give Bedder a shave while in his hospital bed . She continued: 'It's his hands and fingers that will be his biggest challenge. 'This poses the greatest hurdle considering that Bryan is a photographer. 'He is so determined, that I know his sheer will is going to propel him to work HARDER than ever... but his triumphs may still fall short... 'So if there are any C5 photographers out there, please let us know your suggestions.' Before: Shawnelle posted this image of their family on the GoFundMe page of a healthy pre-fall Bryan .

"Joan Cartwright said she now fears for her life after learning the murderer is due to be released . The widow subjected to a vile hate campaign at the hands of triple  killer Harry Roberts last night told how she was ‘terrified’ that he was to be released next week. Joan Cartwright, 71, said nobody had told her about the release of the career criminal – who has threatened to kill her and her husband – and she learned about it only because the story was published in the newspapers. She said the decision had left her in fear for her life, and she attacked the Parole Board for their decision, saying Roberts is a ‘sick man’ incapable of remorse. ‘I’m absolutely terrified at the thought of Harry Roberts being released,’ said Mrs Cartwright, who runs a sanctuary for around 100 animals. ‘I’m frightened he will send someone to kill me.’ She added: ‘He shouldn’t be afforded any human rights for what he’s done. What about the human rights of the police officers and people he has killed?’ Five years ago Roberts’s bid to be released from jail was rejected after it emerged he had terrorised Mrs Cartwright and her family after she complained about his behaviour while working on day release in her animal sanctuary in the East Midlands. Their evidence meant the Parole Board deemed him too dangerous to be back on the streets. Mrs Cartwright told how she and her late husband, Peter, who died of a heart attack eight years ago aged 68, had been forced to give evidence by the police and prison authorities. Despite being assured that they would be protected, documents detailing their statements were leaked to Roberts and sent to him in his prison cell. It was this blunder by the authorities that allowed him to carry out his campaign of harassment which has made their lives a misery. Under the noses of prison guards, he rang her from jail up to five times a week. And there was a series of sickening attacks on her animals. Mrs Cartwright broke down in tears as she recounted how one of her horses was hacked to death and almost decapitated in an axe attack the night before Roberts’s parole hearing in November 2005. In other assaults between 2002 and 2006, a horse lost an eye after being battered with an iron bar; a donkey died after its pelvis was shattered, probably with a baseball bat; the family’s pet cat was electrocuted; and a peacock was strangled. Mrs Cartwright was not invited to give evidence to the latest Parole Board hearing. Incredibly she learned of his impending release from a local councillor who knocked on her door on Thursday following media reports about his release. ‘I nearly collapsed,’ she said. ‘We were assured he would never come out, so I was shocked.’ Harry Roberts was jailed in 1966 after shooting dead two policemen and another person. The criminal was allowed to work at the animal sanctuary on day release from 2001 until a complaint into his behaviour was made. He is pictured (right) in 2009 . It was confirmed this week that Roberts, 78, is to be freed from prison after spending 48 years behind bars for the cold blooded murder of two policemen and another person in West London in 1966. He is expected to be released from Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire next week. The Mail has learned he is likely to use a false name and will be initially assessed at a probation hostel. Then he is expected to be transferred to a warden-controlled hostel. He will be entitled to a state pension and housing benefit. News of his impending release has been condemned by relatives of his murder victims, police leaders and senior politicians, who say he should die in prison. The murderer was sitting with two accomplices in his van near Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London preparing for an armed robbery when he opened fire on twounarmed officers. Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, and Constable Geoffrey Fox, 41, were killed in the attack on August 12, 1966. The case shocked the nation, and Roberts would have hanged for it – but the death penalty had been abolished the year before. But by 2001 he was working on day release from an open prison at the animal sanctuary. The job was supposed to be a prelude to his release the following year. ‘No-one ever told us who he was, to us he was just another worker,’ Mrs Cartwright added. ‘Nobody told us about his criminal past or that he was one of the country’s most notorious murderers.’ Now, knowing he is about to be released, she says she is unable to sleep and is constantly in fear of attack. ‘My life has been ruined, I’ve had no life for the last 15 years,’ she added. Police Constable Geoffret Roger Fox (right) and Temporary Detective Constable David Bertram (left) were killed in the attack . Detective Sergeant Christopher Tippett was also murdered by Roberts in 1966 when he shot them dead . ‘I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, every night when I lock up the animals I’m wondering if they will still be there in the morning. ‘If the authorities had done their job properly then none of this would have happened.’ Mrs Cartwright was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack on her horse and underwent counselling paid for by the Home Office, but she still breaks down when discussing what happened to her animals. Today her home is protected by £65,000 of state-of-the-art CCTV and security. Up until two years ago she also had police panic alarms – with a direct line to armed response units – installed in her property. Now she is hoping they will be re-installed should Roberts be freed, although she is not convinced the police will be able to protect her family. ‘He’s a sick man who has done some dreadful things. He won’t show any remorse for what he’s done – not in a million years.’","Harry Roberts worked at Joan Cartwright's animal sanctuary on day release .

"Two British newlyweds who died from a suspected drugs overdose in India may have killed themselves in a Romeo and Juliet-style suicide pact, a relative said today. The bodies of James and Alex Gaskell were found  on a hotel bed surrounded by sleeping pills, anti-depressants and empty bottles of cough syrup. Police say the couple – both teachers with first-class degrees – died of an overdose in their locked room near the Taj Mahal. A book called The Cult of Tara: Magic and Ritual in Tibet, a travel bag, mobile phone and other holiday paraphernalia can also be seen on their double bed. Mrs Gaskell's stepfather, Greg Pyke, said the couple may have taken their own lives in despair after being 'continually smacked in the face' by the country's shocking levels of poverty. Scroll down for video . Old-fashioned romance: The couple in 2012 (left) and smiling at a temple days before their deaths (right) In the days before their deaths, he said Mrs Gaskell told how her idealistic view of life in India had been shattered by the reality. Mr Pyke also described how her husband 'hated social injustice' and said he had been 'quite depressed' in the run-up to their travels. Alluding to Romeo and Juliet, the architect told The Times: 'Something could have triggered James into a bit of a despair and, you know, he does something daft and she follows. 'They’re both philosophical characters. 'They were incredibly close and although I would have said Alex was inherently a much stronger personality and more balanced, I could conceive of a situation where, if James could take his life, then Alex could follow him.' The shocking scene in their hotel room is a stark contrast to the happy image that Mrs Gaskell, 24, had posted a few days earlier of the couple smiling in front of a temple in Delhi. Her 27-year-old husband had posted a series of messages on Twitter outlining his casual attitude to drugs. His final tweet, on Sunday, two days before their bodies were found, said how easy they were to obtain in India. ‘Codeine under the counter here. With Valium, Xanax and Lyrica. Winning,’ he wrote. Earlier he said: ‘One prescription in India (after you have told the doctor what to write) will take you faaaaaar...’ In another post he said: ‘I am absolutely off my face on drugs.’ Tragic waste: Mr Gaskell pictured as a schoolboy . India is a popular destination for drugs tourists keen to acquire powerful prescription medicines from chemists, with few questions asked. It is unclear whether the couple died from an overdose of prescription drugs or from another substance. Although Mr Gaskell made no secret of his craving for pills, relatives of his wife insisted yesterday she was anti-drugs. The couple, who married last November, were found dead in the Hotel Maya in Agra. As well as strips of coloured capsules, police discovered a prescription for the anti-anxiety drug diazepam. Mr Gaskell was found lying on his side while his wife was slumped in a crouched position. There was evidence in the room that one or both of them had been sick. Rajesh Gupta, who owns the hotel which is a popular haunt for backpackers, said the couple checked in on Monday night. He said: ‘Later they ordered the dinner at 9pm and by 10pm our room service went with dinner. He knocked on the door and James Gaskell opened the door and took the dinner – he didn’t allow our employee inside the room and closed the door. ‘They booked only for one night and were supposed to inform us about an extended stay. ‘When they didn’t come down, our hotel staff knocked their door at 11:30 am on Tuesday, but there was no response and door was locked inside. He informed the manager quickly who later informed the police. ‘Later police arrived and found that both were dead on the bed. Both the television and air conditioner were on. Died: James Gaskell, 27, and his wife Alexandra, 24, pictured together in India just weeks before their death . Drugs paraphernalia: Police found these strips of tablets - thought to be sleeping pills and anti-depressants - next to the couple's bodies on the bed in their hotel room along with bottles cough syrup (not pictured) ‘Police found five empty bottles of cough syrup, strips of sleeping pills, anti-depressants and a medical prescription from the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi, mentioning a drug called diazepam – used to treat anxiety disorders.’ Shalabh Mathur, who is a police chief in Agra, said: ‘From the prescription, it appears that the woman had some sort of headache. ‘A lot of anti-depressants, pain killers and other medicines were found in the room. ‘There were no apparent signs of any struggle or forced entry into the room. We have looked at all possible scenarios and it looks like a case of a drug overdose.’ Ish Anand, the Delhi doctor who prescribed Mr Gaskell the diazepam, said: ‘He said he’d been on the medicine for a long time and he had come to me for a repeat prescription. 'He was addicted to these pills so it’s not safe to come off them immediately, he has to come off them slowly. So I gave him a different dose as a repeat prescription. ‘You need to slowly reduce your intake, it is very serious if you stop taking them immediately, so I felt it reasonable to give him another prescription. Travelling: The couple, both teachers, arrived in the country in July before visiting Agra in early October . Clues: Police forensics officers gather evidence from the hotel room where the couple were found dead . India is seen as a honey-pot for so-called drugs tourists because of the easy availability of prescription medicine. On social media, James Gaskell made it clear – even before he left Britain for India – that he was aware drugs would be more easy to obtain there. Both prescription and over-the-counter drugs in India have come under increasing scrutiny this year, amid claims over safety lapses, falsified drug test results and the sale of fake medicines. Earlier this year, a UN report warned that prescription drug abuse was on the rise in India – with medicines being mixed with dangerous substances. Drugs enter the region’s illicit markets through various channels, being diverted from India’s pharmaceutical industry and smuggled from Afghanistan, the report said. ‘Prescription drug abuse is growing in India,’ the report added. Concerns over India’s over-the-counter and prescription drugs have been expressed by US regulators. Margaret A Hamburg, of the Food and Drug Administration, visited India in February to express her growing unease with the safety of Indian medicines because of ‘recent lapses in quality at a handful of pharmaceutical firms’. India’s pharmaceutical industry supplies 40 per cent of over-the-counter and generic prescription drugs consumed in the US. ‘He seemed stable, calm, alert and walked well. It was a medicine that I just continued to give him; it wasn’t a new prescription. 'He was very well informed about the medicine and I felt he knew what he was doing.’ Mrs Gaskell’s stepfather Greg Pike told the Mail that her husband took drugs to treat depression. ‘This wasn’t two young people on a drug-fuelled trip around India,’ he insisted. ‘They went to there to experience the Indian way of life and the culture. ‘Alex has always been very wary of drugs and drug culture. She just wasn’t interested.’ The 67-year-old architect added: ‘James was a very intense young guy. He had really strong views about social injustice and there were a lot of things in the world he was unhappy about. He was like a student from the 60s. ‘It’s no secret that James had bouts of depression. That maybe came from all the things that he had going around in his head. I know he had taken anti-depressants while out in India.’ Mr Pike, of Marple Bridge, Cheshire said: ‘They had been planning the trip to India for some time and we were surprised when they decided to get married first. It seemed an old-fashioned idea.’ The couple both taught languages at Manchester International College and wanted to teach English abroad on an extended work-holiday that would take in Indonesia. ‘It wasn’t just a holiday, they planned to be away for some time,’ said Mr Pike. Mrs Gaskell’s mother, Anna-Louise, 46, was said to be too upset to speak last night. Mr Gaskell’s mother Ann Palmer, who runs a consultancy business, refused to comment at her home near Sevenoaks in Kent. His father Phil, who lives in Wilmslow, Cheshire, posted on Facebook: ‘I can’t understand how I should feel at the moment, my mind is blank. Just very sad.’ Family member Diane Gaskell said on Facebook – beneath a picture of James as a schoolboy: ‘He was a cutie, and when I see him and Alex at their wedding reception never in a million years would I have dreamed this would happen. The couple were found dead after checking into the Hotel Maya (above), in Tajganj area of Agra, on Monday . The two were found in their hotel room, in Agra, India, which is located near the Taj Mahal (pictured) ‘They were such a lovely couple who had their lives in front of them.’ Mrs Gaskell was keen on photography and had studied the subject at Liverpool’s John Moores University. She gained a Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages to start working alongside her husband in Manchester. Mr Gaskell graduated in 2012. The couple, who had been dating for five years before they married, went to India in early July. Soon after arriving in India Mr Gaskell was prescribed anti-psychotic drugs by a doctor and tweeted: ‘Chemically coshed. Not in a good way. Some Indian doctors are insane.’ Additional reporting: Christian Gysin, Liz Hull and Francesca Infante .","James and Alex Gaskell found beside wide array of prescription drugs .

"Dramatic new forensic evidence could clear a university student convicted of the brutal murder of her married lover's young wife. Mindy Sanghera, a Sikh now aged 30, was jailed for life in 2007 after a jury found her guilty of murdering the 17-year-old pregnant wife of playboy businessman Sair Ali, a Muslim. But the case against her was largely based on circumstantial evidence – there was no forensic proof that she stabbed Mr Ali's wife Sana more than 40 times and plunged a knife into her womb at his family's £500,000 home in Bury, Greater Manchester. Prison chic: Mindy Sanghera was allowed to wear full make-up as she posed for pictures at Foston Hall women's prison in Derbyshire  where she is serving a life sentence . Sanghera's legal team have now unearthed what they consider to be 'compelling new evidence' for the case to be referred to the Court of Appeal and her conviction quashed. They say fresh analysis of mobile phones suggests someone used or accessed the victim's phone after Sanghera had left the home, while new tests show Sanghera could not have escaped through a small kitchen window without leaving forensic traces. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which refers cases to the Court of Appeal, is 'actively pursuing' new lines of inquiry. The twist in the case comes as pictures emerged of Sanghera inside Foston Hall women's prison in Derbyshire, where she is serving a minimum 14-year life term. Wedding day: Sair Ali and his teenage bride Sana, who was stabbed 40 times at her home in Manchester . The case against Sanghera her was largely based on circumstantial evidence – there was no forensic proof that she stabbed Mr Ali's wife Sana . The photographs, showing her in full make-up and in a variety of poses in the prison garden and carpeted landing, are likely to raise questions over whether convicted killers should be afforded such privileges. She also has her own cell, complete with TV, radio, kettle and washing facilities. In a submission to the commission, her lawyer, Julian Young, said the phone analysis 'puts an almost totally different complexion on the case'. He added: 'It is submitted that the evidence points strongly to the fact that whoever accessed the mobile telephone was the murderer.' A key part of the appeal concerns Sanghera's footprint, which was found near a window in the kitchen. The prosecution said that the student climbed through this after butchering her love rival. But Sanghera insists Sana let her out through the door and then locked it. She says she had gone to see the young bride to tell her that her husband was a love cheat. In legal papers, Mr Young says his client accepts she stood near a window to try to close it. But he adds that a videoed reconstruction shows it would have been difficult for her to get through it easily and without leaving forensic evidence. At the time of the murder, in May 2007, Sanghera was two years into an affair with Mr Ali and had learned he had gone through with an arranged marriage to his teenage cousin Sana. Days after contacting police to say she had been at their home hours before Sana's body was found, Sanghera was charged with murder. Her lawyers say detectives were too quick to rule out other possible suspects and motives. Born to a hard-working Sikh couple, Sanghera was a straight A student on the brink of graduating from Birmingham University's dentistry school. Mr Ali, who ran his own mobile phone business, had led a playboy lifestyle, conducting affairs and frequenting nightclubs. He admitted at the trial that he had 'sinned'. He met Harmohinder Kaur Sanghera, known as Mindy, in 2005, and they conducted their affair in hotel rooms. When Sanghera found out Sana was pregnant, she became consumed with jealousy, her trial heard. Sanghera admitted visiting Sana when Mr Ali was out at Friday prayers, but said she had left her alive and well, and at her trial the defence suggested Mr Ali had killed her. In 2009, the Court of Appeal threw out her case. At home in Shirley in the West Midlands, Sanghera's parents Paul, 52, a postman, and Suki, 51, who works at Marks & Spencer, said their daughter is determined to clear her name. Mrs Sanghera said: 'From day one, Mindy has told the truth.' Mr Ali now lives overseas and could not be reached for comment. His father refused to comment.

"A judge has attacked Britain’s most senior policeman over’s his force’s treatment of the innocent man framed by disgraced Met commander Ali Dizaei, saying he had ‘thrown him to the wolves’. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was blasted over his force’s reluctance to pay damages to web designer Waad al-Baghdadi, whose evidence helped bring down the lying police chief. In an extraordinary broadside, His Honour Judge Freeland QC attacked Sir Bernard’s claim that the Met was not responsible for Dizaei’s conduct. Extraordinary broadside: His Honour Judge Freeland QC (left) blasted Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (right) over his force's reluctance to pay damages to an innocent man . He added that Mr al-Baghdadi had been to ‘hell and back’ by twice giving evidence against Dizaei, who arrested him unlawfully while serving in the force. Details of Judge Freeland’s attack on the Yard boss can be revealed after the Mail won a battle lasting several months to obtain transcripts of the court showdown between lawyers representing Mr al-Baghdadi and Sir Bernard. The Met had previously declined to comment when asked if it had been rebuked by the judge during a hearing at the Central London County Court – at which no journalists were present. This meant the Mail had to make a special application to get transcripts of what was said. Dizaei, 52, was first convicted of framing young businessman Mr al-Baghdadi in a street row over money in 2010. He was jailed for four years, but his convictions for misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice were quashed by the Court of Appeal a year later. The Iranian-born commander - dubbed a ‘Criminal in Uniform’ by the head of the police watchdog - was found guilty for a second time at a retrial in February 2012 and received a three-year prison sentence. CCTV: Scotland Yard Commander Ali Dizaei (right) after he arrested Waad al-Baghdadi (left) at Hammersmith police station in west London in July 2008 . A panel of judges headed by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, has since thrown out another appeal bid by Dizaei, a former president of the National Black Police Association who repeatedly played the race card to bully cowardly Yard bosses into tolerating his conduct. Now it can be revealed that in the aftermath of Dizaei’s second conviction, Mr al-Baghdadi, 30, launched a damages claim against the Met over his ordeal. At the Central London County Court barrister Rajeev Shetty, representing the Met, said that the force was not responsible for Dizaei’s actions and suggested that Mr al-Baghdadi should sue the former officer for damages instead. But Judge Freeland said Mr al-Baghdadi ‘has at least in part been put through hell and back again because he has given evidence in support of a prosecution where his name has been pilloried in cross examination’. ‘He has achieved partial vindication by virtue of the jury convicting Dizaei twice,’ he added. ‘But here he is asserting his civil rights, only to be thrown to the wolves by the Commissioner, I assume on cogent instructions at the highest level.’ The judge paid tribute to Mr al-Baghdadi’s stand against Dizaei, whom he described as being ‘a blatant and downright liar’. ‘Without Mr al-Baghdadi’s evidence there would have been no prospect whatsoever of convicting Dizaei,’ he added. Ordeal: The judge said web designer Waad al-Baghdadi (left) had been to 'hell and back' by twice giving evidence against disgraced Met commander Ali Dizaei (right), who arrested him unlawfully . Clearly irritated by the Met’s stance, the judge ruled: ‘I hold that the defendant (the Met) must inexorably and inevitably and beyond any reasonable argument be responsible for his actions, which are manifestly so closely connected with his office as a police commander employed by the Metropolitan Police Service.’ Coverage in the Mail: Dizaei, 52, was first convicted of framing young businessman Mr al-Baghdadi in a street row over money in 2010 . It is understood Mr al-Baghdadi received a ‘substantial five figure sum’ from the Met. Scotland Yard declined to comment on how much compensation it had agreed to pay Mr al-Baghdadi. ‘His Honour Judge Freeland found that the Commissioner was vicariously liable for the torts committed by former Commander Dizaei. An apology did not form part of the settlement,’ said a spokesman. Asked whether the judge had criticised the Met, the spokesman said: ‘Various arguments were put forward by both parties for the judge to consider. The judge found in favour of the claimant.’ Last Autumn Scotland Yard sparked fury after it paid off Dizaei to escape an embarrassing public legal battle. The ex-Met officer had launched a claim against his former employer for racial and religious discrimination and hoped to win a payout of more than £1million. In return for Dizaei dropping his legal claim, the Met and its oversight body the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (Mopac) made a contribution towards Dizaei’s legal costs – thought to be worth more than £50,000 – but did not pay him any compensation. In addition, Mopac said it was seeking to seize a large portion of Dizaei’s police pension. A Mopac spokesman said last night: ‘We can confirm that a decision to forfeit a portion of Mr Dizaei’s pension has been approved. This decision is now subject to a judicial review in the Crown Court.’ Mr al-Baghdadi could not be reached for comment.","MAILONLINE EXCLUSIVE .

"This middle class woman has been unveiled as one of the trolls accused of targeting vile internet abuse at Madeleine Mccann's parents. Scotland Yard is currently investigating the posting online of hundreds of hate messages aimed at the McCanns, whose daughter disappeared during a family holiday to Portugal in 2007. Detectives have decided to act after being given a dossier from McCann family supporters which catalogues the abusive remarks – including death threats – aimed at the couple on Twitter, Facebook and online forums. And Brenda Leyland, 63, who has posted dozens of messages attacking the McCanns using the Twitter handle @sweepyface, has been identified as one of them. Scroll down for video . Brenday Leyland, 63, , using the Twitter name @sweepyface, is one of the trolls targeting the McCann parents . The woman was tracked down to the picturesque village of Burton Overy in the Leicestershire countryside . When Sky News' Martin Brunt tracked Mrs Leyland down to her house in the idyllic Leicestershire village of Burton Overy and confronted her, she remained defiant about what she had done. When asked why she was using her Twitter account to attack the McCanns, who live with their younger children, nine-year-old twins, in Rothley, Leicestershire, Mrs Leyland replied: 'I'm entitled to do that.' And when Mr Brunt told her that she had been reported to police, and that Scotland Yard was considering a dossier of Twitter accounts said to show a 'campaign of abuse' against the McCanns, she paused as she got into a 4x4 and replied: 'That's fair enough.' The crime correspondent said he was later invited into Mrs Leyland's house, where she told him she 'had questions for the McCanns' but 'hoped she hadn't broken the law' by posting tweets in which she spread rumours about the McCanns' marriage, and said she hoped they would suffer for ever. The messages were among those posted by internet trolls who wrongly believe that Kate and Gerry, both 46, had some involvement in the disappearance of their three-year-old daughter Madeleine in Portugal in 2007. The couple, who were cleared by police from any part in their daughter's disappearance, have been told by trolls to 'burn in hell'. Troll: Mrs Leyland, 63, lives in Burton Overy, Leicestershire - the same country as Mr and Mrs McCann . These are some of the abusive messages, including one by @sweepyface, top right, directed at the McCanns . Some messages are even directed at Madeleine's younger twin siblings, now aged nine. According to Sky News, 'manipulated images' involving the McCanns – many of them graphic – are also in wide circulation online. The majority of those who post the vile messages use anonymous social media accounts, so their true identities are disguised. But detectives, who are now in talks with the Crown Prosecution Service after being handed a 65-page dossier on the campaign of abuse, are confident they can identify the culprits. The dossier – compiled by members of the public who sympathise with the McCanns – calls on police and MPs to crack down on such abuse. Under the 2003 Communications Act, it is an offence to send messages online that are grossly offensive. Abuse: The messages have been posted by internet trolls who wrongly believe that Kate and Gerry had some involvement in the disappearance of their  daughter Madeleine in Portugal in 2007 . Among the messages in the dossier is an exchange on a message board which reads: 'These two should burn in hell'… 'I will supply the petrol'… 'I'll supply the lighter – happily'. Other posts include: 'We need some numbers for some assassins' and 'I want to see them… trampled by horses.' Also, several trolls claim to live near to the McCanns. One troll who claimed to live in their village posted: 'I'm going round with the cuffs and bags.' Another troll who claimed to live locally said: 'Saw KM at the gym today, gave her a look of utter disgust, managed to hold my tongue though.' The dossier's authors claim that at least six Twitter accounts have been set up principally to abuse the McCanns and their supporters. The campaigner spearheading the appeal – who has asked to remain anonymous – told Sky News: 'We're very worried that it's only going to take somebody to act out some of these discussions, some of the threats, and we couldn't live with ourselves if that happened and we had done nothing.' Former police chief and online child security expert Jim Gamble said: 'I'm deeply concerned by the behaviours displayed… I think the time has come for the hardcore few in the midst of this group to be investigated.' A spokesman for Scotland Yard said today: 'We can confirm we have received a letter and documentation on 9 September which was passed to officers from Operation Grange [the police review into Madeleine's disappearance]. 'They are assessing its contents and consulting with the CPS and the McCann family.' Detective Inspector Michael Kilkenny of the Metropolitan Police told the campaign group: 'In consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service and the McCann family, the material will now be assessed and decisions made as to what further action, if any, should be undertaken.' Last night the McCanns declined to comment.

"Jailed: Emily Fox, 26, is one of dozens of teachers to have had relationships with pupils in the last year . At least two teachers are banned from classrooms every month over ‘inappropriate relationships’ with pupils, figures reveal. A total of 28 were expelled from the profession last year after misconduct proceedings over their disgraceful behaviour towards youngsters. The figure can be revealed days after a lesbian PE teacher at a leading private school was jailed for 15 months for having sex with one of her pupils. Emily Fox, 26, who taught at the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, exchanged hundreds of sexually explicit messages with the 15-year-old girl. They struck up a friendship which developed into an ‘intense’ bond that involved kissing and later sexual touching, a court heard. Now, after a Freedom of Information request from the Daily Mail, the Department for Education has released figures showing the scale of the problem of teachers who lust after pupils. They reveal that 28 members of the profession were banned last year after disciplinary proceedings were brought by the National College for Teaching and Leadership over alleged inappropriate relationships with pupils. A further five teachers kept their jobs after facing misconduct hearings over the same issue. The DfE said it could not provide corresponding figures for previous years from the General Teaching Council, which had responsibility for disciplining teachers before the National College for Teaching and Leadership was set up. The revelations follow a string of high-profile cases involving teachers who tried to forge inappropriate relationships with pupils. In June last year, married maths teacher Jeremy Forrest was jailed for five-and-a-half years for child abduction and sexual activity with a child, after a case which hit the headlines here and abroad. Forrest, 30, prompted an international manhunt when he ran away to France with a 15-year-old female pupil. Their relationship began after the teenager developed a crush on him at Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Over four months they had sex in his car, at his home and at hotels, often without contraception, before Forrest took the teenager abroad. His victim, now 16, had vowed to stand by him but has since been reported to have found a partner nearer her own age. In July, Andrew Eades, 25, was banned from the country’s classrooms for life after setting up a mobile phone to record in a toilet at Kingsthorpe Community College in Northampton. Scroll down for video . High-profile: Jeremy Forrest went on the run with a teenager and had sex with her over a period of four months . Another case involved a teacher at a Preston school who sent Facebook messages to pupils asking about their sex lives. Stephen Griffiths, 36, was banned from teaching for at least two years after a panel found he was guilty of unacceptable conduct while employed at Fulwood Academy. A 49-year-old married woman teacher who sent inappropriate messages to a boy pupil at her school was also kicked out of the profession. Yvonne Preston, who taught at Castle Hall School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, sent him cards containing phrases such as ‘you light up my world like nobody else’ and ‘just being with you breaks my heart’. She was barred from teaching until at least July 2016, when she can apply to have the ban lifted. London maths teacher Nkosana Brown, 33, who sent messages to a pupil sending her ‘kisses all over your body’, was banned for a minimum of five years.

"Paul Gambaccini said he went through 12 months of trauma when he was put on police bail over allegations of historic sexual offences . Veteran DJ Paul Gambaccini yesterday backed the Home Secretary’s plan to limit the time suspects can be kept on police bail without charge. The 65-year-old broadcaster, who spent a year on bail before being told last week he would not be prosecuted over historic sex abuse allegations, said he welcomed Theresa May’s proposals with ‘enthusiasm’. Concern over the issue has grown after a number of high-profile cases in which people were left in limbo for long periods before learning that they would not face trial. Scotland Yard was criticised after Gambaccini and entertainers Jim Davidson and Freddie Starr were left on bail for months over sex allegations in the Operation Yewtree investigation set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal. None were prosecuted. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, 74, spent 11 months on police bail before being told this year that he would not be charged over sex abuse claims investigated by North Yorkshire Police. Elsewhere, dozens of journalists have been repeatedly bailed as police investigate allegations of phone hacking and bribery. Mrs May told chief constables yesterday that the Government would look at introducing a statutory limit on how long suspects could be kept on ‘pre-charge bail’. Paul Gambaccini, pictured in a radio studio in 1995, has welcomed proposals to limit the time suspects spend on police bail after his own 12 month ordeal . Theresa May, the Home Secretary, has announced a consultation into the way police bail is used to prevent suspects having to wait for months or years to learn if they will be charged . Freddie Starr (left) spent 18 months on police bail before he learned he would not be charged. Comedian Jim Davidson (right) was on police bail for eight months. Both were arrested under Operation Yewtree . Gambaccini, who was cleared last week after what he called ‘12 months of horror and trauma’, said: ‘I hope it leads to change that will prevent future injustices. If my ordeal can help prevent other persons from a similar fate, it will have been worthwhile.’ Figures compiled by BBC Radio 5 Live from 40 police forces show 71,526 suspects are on bail – 5,480 of them for more than six months. Operation Yewtree was set up in the wake of sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile . The force average is 1,788 suspects bailed, compared with 1,689 last year. Speaking at the annual conference of the College of Policing, which sets police standards, Mrs May said she was pleased senior officers were ‘developing evidence-based guidance to bring consistency, transparency and rigour to the way pre-charge bail is used in criminal investigations’. The Home Secretary added: ‘But in parallel we must also look at statutory time limits on the use of pre-charge bail to prevent people spending months or even years on bail only for no charges to be brought.’ Law Society president Andrew Caplen said there should be a limit of 28 days to stop people being left ‘in the wilderness’ as police decided whether to charge them. He said: ‘Not only does keeping someone on police bail interfere with their liberty, it means police investigations can be slow, making the justice system less efficient and with a negative effect on complainants and witnesses.’ John Harding, of legal firm Kingsley Napley, said: ‘This affects thousands of non-celebrities every day, often with devastating impact.’ College of Policing boss Chief Constable Alex Marshall said police bail was ‘an important tool’, but added: ‘There are concerns about variations in the time people remain on bail.’","Paul Gambaccini, 65, was arrested under Operation Yewtree .

Rescue workers remove a body from the debris of a building collapse in Rosny-sous-Bois, Paris, this morning . ‘The area has been evacuated, and alternative accommodation is being provided in a local sports hall,' said the fire brigade spokesman. Spokesman Gabriel Plus said around ten people had been rescued from the building. 'We could still find living victims in the hours to come,' he added. Cause: Philippe Galli, Seine-Saint-Denis prefect, said the explosion was 'most probably' the result of a gas leak . Dramatic: The blast had ripped through half of an adjacent apartment block, leaving what was left of the destroyed flats exposed . Theory: France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who has visited the scene, said that a gas leak was among the theories being considered for the cause of the blast . Philippe Galli, Seine-Saint-Denis prefect, said the explosion was 'most probably' the result of a gas leak. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve visited the scene, but could not confirm a theory that the explosion was caused by a gas leak. 'I’m here to give my support to the emergency services,' he said. 'My thoughts are with the families involved, and the huge amount of suffering they are going through.' Before: The four-storey building in Rosny as it looked before this morning's explosion . Location: The explosion took place in Rosny-sous-Bois, a north eastern suburb of Paris . Mr Cazeneuve said a gas leak was an early theory, but added that 'we must be careful’ about rushing to conclusions as the the cause of the explosion. He said that the 22 people living in the remaining two thirds of the building have been given emergency accomodation as the rest of the structure is at risk of collapse. Speaking at a socialist party conference in La Rochelle, Prime Minister Manuel Valls began his speech by sending out a 'message of solidarity' to the victims of the explosion.","Child, eight, and  woman, 80, killed as blast causes building to collapse .

"Sir John Sawers called for Britain’s overseas intelligence service to be more agile in response to the threats posed by the uprisings in the Middle East . The head of MI6 yesterday launched a thinly-disguised attack on the West’s inadequate response to the Arab Spring. In a rare public intervention, Sir John Sawers called for Britain’s overseas intelligence service to be more agile in response to the threats posed by the uprisings in the Middle East. ‘If you decide not to [rebuild], as we did in Libya, partly because of the scars from Iraq, then you topple the government and you end up having nothing in its place,’ he said. ‘And if you don’t intervene at all, you end up with a situation like you have in Syria. These are real dilemmas.’ Sir John, British ambassador in Cairo between 2001 and 2003, said the Arab Spring – a series of populist uprisings in North African dictatorships between 2010 and 2012 – demonstrated that revolutionary change is impossible to manage. It will normally end up worse for Western interests and values, he added. ‘We saw it in Tehran in 1979, and we’ve seen it in Egypt over the past few years,’ he said in an interview with the Financial Times. His comments will embarrass David Cameron and Nick Clegg, both of whom have been accused of over-the-top reactions to the uprisings. In 2011, Mr Clegg infamously described events in Egypt as ‘incredibly exciting’. Hundreds had already been killed or beaten when the Deputy Prime Minister told ITV: ‘It is incredibly exciting what is going on, it reminds me so much of the time when the Berlin Wall fell, the power of the people out on the streets, in a regime which two weeks ago everybody thought was one of the most stable regimes in the region.’ Mr Cameron visited both Cairo’s Tahrir Square and the Libyan capital Tripoli in 2011. He also addressed the United Nations on the exciting implications of the Arab Spring, saying: ‘Where there was fear, now there is hope and an optimism and belief that is truly inspiring.’ Protesters in Tahrir Square, Cairo, show their support for Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate . But in recent months, the Foreign Office has had to coordinate the rescue of hundreds of Britons stranded in Tripoli which is still mired in turmoil. Libya has since lurched ever closer to fragmentation and civil war after Islamist-led militias seized the airport in Tripoli and proclaimed their own government. Sir John, whose job title is traditionally known as ‘C’, retires in November after five years in post during which he has not been afraid to speak out about his security concerns. Thousands of Libyans celebrate the arrest of Gaddafi's son Saif al-islam and the partial fall of Tripoli in Benghazi, in 2011 . In 2010 he suggested the war on terror was too focused on Afghanistan even as the US and UK were pursuing a military surge against the Taliban. He told the Financial Times yesterday: ‘Terrorists were bobbing up elsewhere in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia and so on, and they weren’t getting anything like the attention that the terrorist threat from Afghanistan was.’ On secondment to Baghdad in 2003, shortly after the US-led invasion, Sir John told London that Iraq was descending into chaos. Last November, he appeared before the Intelligence and Security Committee of MPs and peers and was asked why the security services had failed to predict the fall of the Soviet Union, 9/11 and the Arab Spring. He said that was not their job, telling the committee: ‘We acquire the secrets that other countries don’t want us to know... we are not all-knowing specialists in what’s going to happen next month or next year.’","Sir John Sawers called for Britain’s overseas intelligence service to be more agile in response to the threats posed by the uprisings in the Middle East .

"Celebrity divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth has been fined after being caught ploughing his £50,000 Mercedes into a parked car and then speeding away from the scene. The cigar-chomping solicitor, renowned for helping ex-wives land huge divorce settlements, was captured on CCTV crashing into the VW Polo – shunting it yards down the street – while trying to reverse in one of London’s most exclusive roads. He owned up only after the footage, from a resident’s security camera, was handed to police who confronted him with the evidence. Scroll down for video . Fined: Solicitor Raymond Tooth, nicknamed Jaws, with fellow celebrity lawyer Fiona Shackleton . The vehicle’s owner, 23-year-old Tom Gayner, said: 'It seems so unfair that the punishment for a hit and run accident like this, even though nobody was injured, is just £600' Twice-married Mr Tooth, 74, whose reputation has earned him the nickname Jaws, could have been fined a total of up to £10,000. But magistrates decided he should only have to pay £600, a £30 ‘victim surcharge’ and £85 costs, and be given five penalty points. Now the owner of the Polo – which was written off – has claimed the sentence was too lenient and will not act as a deterrent. Mr Tooth – whose motto is ‘Don’t get even, get Tooth’ – once helped Sadie Frost reportedly scoop a £4million lump sum, a £2million house and a £15,000-a-month allowance from Jude Law. Other previous clients include Cheryl Barrymore, who received £3.5million from husband Michael, and Eimear Montgomerie, who walked away from her marriage to golfer Colin with £15million. He also advised Roman Abramovich’s former wife Irina on their split, which was estimated to have cost the oligarch hundreds of millions. Video of the incident in Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea, shows Mr Tooth’s Mercedes reversing slowly into a parking space in March. Then, with the manoeuvre seemingly completed, it suddenly ploughs into the Polo parked behind before speeding away. The vehicle’s owner, 23-year-old Tom Gayner, told the Daily Mail: ‘It seems so unfair that the punishment for a hit and run accident like this, even though nobody was injured, is just £600 and five penalty points. The sentence seems unduly lenient – certainly it is no deterrent for these type of offences.’ Mr Gayner, who works in sports marketing, lives with his society GP father and mother in Upper Cheyne Row. Plenty of room: CCTV shows Mr Tooth begin to reverse his Mercedes along Upper Cheyne Road, in Chelsea . Getting closer: He continues towards Tom Gayner's Volkswagen Polo, which is parked on the street . Oops!: The Mercedes went on to plough into the Polo, which Mr Gayner says was written off in the incident . The road was in the headlines in 2004 when one of its residents, City banker John Monckton, was stabbed to death during a robbery at his home. Around that time a number of households clubbed together to buy CCTV cameras to improve security. Mr Gayner said he was abroad when his car was damaged but his mother and a neighbour trawled through hours of CCTV footage which was then handed to police. He added: ‘The insurance company paid out for the value of the car. It was worth a little over £2,000 when it was written off.’ Mr Tooth lives in an £8million house in Chelsea while his law firm, Sears Tooth, is based in Mayfair. He pleaded guilty when his case was heard before Bromley Magistrates on August 27. He was fined £300 after admitting driving without due care and attention, and ordered to pay a £30 surcharge plus £85 costs. Mr Tooth also admitted a separate charge of failing to stop at the scene of an accident and was fined a further £300. Driving without due care carries a maximum sentence of a £5,000 fine and up to nine points. Failing to stop after an accident can result in up to ten points, a £5,000 fine and six months in jail. Last night Mr Tooth said: ‘Whilst I cannot give you a detailed response, I can say that I told the police the particular mitigating circumstances, of which the court were informed, and presumably they were taken into account. ‘All that happened was whilst parking in the middle of the day I reversed into a parked car, having suffered a severe abdominal pain seconds before.’","Raymond Tooth reversed his car into a parked VW Polo on a Chelsea street .

"The former senior detective who brought two of Stephen Lawrence’s murderers to justice claims Scotland Yard chiefs have lost interest in the case. Clive Driscoll, who retired from the Metropolitan Police a few weeks ago, also alleges his successful investigation into killers Gary Dobson and David Norris was hampered by ‘disruption tactics’ from within the force. He added senior officers in the Met had discussions about holding back certain documents from the Ellison Review, the independent inquiry that looked into allegations of police corruption in the Lawrence case. Clive Driscoll brought two of Stephen Lawrence¿s murderers to justice. He claims Scotland Yard chiefs have lost interest in the case . He warned: 'One bad decision around disclosure undoes the remarkable work that police officers do up and down the country. 'For me, just be open and honest, warts and all.' Supporters of Mr Driscoll, who reached the rank of detective chief inspector and enjoyed the trust of Stephen’s parents Neville and Doreen, claim he was cruelly forced out of the Met as part of its drive to cut costs. They also say his departure reflects the force’s dwindling interest in Stephen’ s case, which has cost the force tens of millions of pounds in terms of different investigations, public inquiries and compensation to the black teenager’s family. Loss: Stephen Lawrence was 18 when he was stabbed to death near a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993, in a racist attack by a gang of white youths . Stephen’s close friend Duwayne Brooks, who witnessed his murder, says he has lost confidence in the Met as a result of Mr Driscolls’s enforced departure in May. But Yard sources insist the force remains committed to bringing other members of the gang who murdered Stephen to justice, and point out that with more than 30 years’ of police service, Mr Driscoll was eligible to retire on a full pension. Stephen Lawrence was 18 when he was stabbed to death near a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993, in a racist attack by a gang of white youths. After years of bungling and failed inquiries, Mr Driscoll eventually led an investigation that brought the case to court successfully. Dobson and Norris – two of the original five prime suspects named as Stephen’s killers by the Daily Mail in 1997 - were convicted of murder in January 2012, following a forensic breakthrough in the case. But Mr Driscoll said there had been officers inside the Met who did not want a 'successful prosecution'. He told BBC2’s Newsnight programme: 'There were certainly people I think in senior levels in the Met that weren’t enthusiastic about the investigation. I certainly felt that.” He felt so concerned about what he described as “disruption tactics” that he said he emailed some senior officers with his fears. In his interview with Newsnight, he did not elaborate on his concerns. He said relationships between the Lawrence family and the Met were as bad as they had been just after Stephen’s murder and said the Met must now be as transparent as possible to rebuild the trust of the public. He said: 'I believe we are in a position today where we have an opportunity to learn and we have an opportunity to put right some of the wrongs.” Responding to the retired detective’s claims, Duwayne Brooks told Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday (wed) that he had yet to speak to anyone from the new team of Met officers now investigating Stephen’s murder. ‘I would like to see more convictions. I would like to see everyone involved convicted,’ he said. He said he didn’t know whether he would be able to trust the police, in aftermath of Mr Driscoll’s departure. ‘The way Clive has been treated is not how I would expect the Metropolitan Police to treat somebody who has just got a conviction…a conviction nobody thought was possible,’ he said. Jocelyn Cockburn, Neville Lawrence’s solicitor, told Today: ‘Like Duwayne Brooks has said, it is unfortunate that after a successful conviction, the murder (inquiry) team that had Mr Lawrence’s full confidence has been changed. 'There is a feeling that the murder investigation is being closed down. Mr Lawrence will need some persuasion that is being vigorously pursued.’ She said Mr Lawrence is seeking a further inquiry into claims of a ‘lack of transparency and cooperation’ in the Met with the 1998 Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen’s murder, which considered whether corruption had blighted the initial inquiry into his death. ‘If Mr Driscoll is saying there were attempts to derail the (most recent) murder investigation, then I would consider that to be new,’ she added. The Met said no relevant Stephen Lawrence material had been intentionally withheld from the Ellison Review of the Lawrence case and its policy was to be open and transparent. It added it was still committed to continuing the Lawrence investigation.","Clive Driscoll led investigation to catch the teenager's killers .

"A Scotland Yard report on the Plebgate affair shows ‘industrial levels of dishonesty by police working in Downing Street’, a senior Tory MP said last night. David Davis hit out after the Met published a series of documents summarising its inquiry into the aftermath of the incident, which resulted in four police officers being sacked. The Met also identified a female officer who texted a colleague two days after the incident to declare that she could ‘topple’ the Tory government. And it released new CCTV footage, of the heated disagreement between diplomatic protection officer Toby Rowland and then Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell at the gates of Downing Street in September 2012. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage of the plebgate row shows a passer-by watching as the then Tory chief whip attempts to cycle out of the main gates of Downing Street . The new material - released by Scotland Yard from its investigation into the Plebgate affair 'dubbed Operation Alice' - shows the witness stopping to watch the confrontation . The witness turns back on himself after seeing Mr Mitchell told by police officers to wheel his bike through the side entrance . Previously-unseen CCTV images of the Plebgate row reveal that a passer-by witnessed the confrontation between police and Mr Mitchell. The man, who is clearly seen following the exchange, has never been traced. Today’s CCTV footage shows Mr Mitchell cycling down the middle of the street and then talking to three officers at the gate while a fourth stands nearby outside. In the original police account, several members of the public are said to have witnessed the exchange and were ‘visibly shocked’. A Dispatches documentary for Channel 4 challenged this with images obtained from CCTV shot from within Downing Street. But today's separate CCTV footage shows there were at least three members of the public outside the gates at the time of the row. At least one appeared to be listening to the exchange. PC Rowland alleges Mr Mitchell called police officers ‘****ing plebs’ during their exchange. Mr Mitchell denies he used the word ‘pleb’ but has apologised for swearing. Tory MPs and supporters of Mr Mitchell said that, despite the report being a ‘police report into the police’, it still showed dishonesty by officers working in Downing Street. They said serious questions must now be asked about whether the Diplomatic Protection Group in charge of guarding No. 10 was fit for purpose. Mr Davis, a former shadow Home Secretary, said: ‘What we have got here is evidence of industrial-scale dishonesty. There was a pack of policemen telling a pack of lies. This involved serious collusion between police officers who set out to harm the democratically elected Government. ‘Despite their attempts to justify their action on security grounds, it transpires that the only written guidance was that ministers should have ‘unfettered access at any time of day or night and at any entry point’. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This overdue report offers further evidence of the concerted deception used by police officers to stitch up Andrew Mitchell. ‘It’s shocking that specialist officers recruited to protect Downing Street saw fit to engage in such an outrageous plan to topple a senior minister. It’s a serious blow to public confidence in the police.’ Further details were also revealed of how a policewoman on duty in Downing Street on the night of the Plebgate incident texted a colleague two days later to say she could bring down the Government. WPC Gillian Weatherley saw, but did not hear, what happened between Mr Mitchell and PC Rowland. In the text, which had grammatical errors and was sent on September 21, 2012, to a colleague referred to as Officer 18, Weatherley wrote: ‘This will make you feel better, I’m the officer that stopped the chief whip leaving Downing St in Wednesday. He didn’t swear at me but Toby that let him out the side gate. I could topple the Tory government x.’ At a misconduct hearing, Weatherley said she had known the recipient of her text for more than 20 years and the message was just ‘banter’.But a month later, on October 21, a text message was sent from her phone number to a neighbour called Nick. It read: ‘Not today but I’m at the front gates tomorrow so I still have time to bring the government down…’ Weatherley lost her job after she failed to provide an honest account of her role in the handling of an email by PC Rowland that described the incident. She denied having passed on PC Rowland’s email when she had in fact sent a picture of the email to a colleague. This was passed to a newspaper. Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell was targeted by a police conspiracy after swearing when blocked from cycling through the main Downing Street gates . CCTV footage shot from within Downing Street and published by Channel 4's Dispatches programme was held up by Mr Mitchell's allies as proof that there was no sign of any passers-by said to have overheard him rowing with police . In April, two of the most senior officials in the scandal-hit Police Federation quit – days after the Daily Mail revealed that the union, unhappy about proposed cutbacks, had hired a PR firm to mastermind a ‘guerrilla’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the Government in the run up to Plebgate. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Patricia Gallan, who led the inquiry into Plebgate – codenamed Operation Alice – said: ‘We understand the public interest in this case, which is why we have taken the unusual step of publishing this material. ‘Ultimately four police officers have been dismissed from the Met, one of whom was sent to prison. Every serving police officer has cause to feel let down by those colleagues who fall below the standards we all strive to uphold.’ The report also unearthed details of Mr Mitchell’s previous altercations with police in Downing Street. A former head of security and business continuity at No 10, who is not named, said there were two incidents dating back to 2011 when the Tory MP swore about not being allowed through a rear entrance. Mr Mitchell is involved in two potentially expensive libel actions over Plebgate. He is suing the Sun newspaper over its original report about his row with PC Rowland, who, in turn, is suing Mr Mitchell over comments he made at a press conference last year. The case is due before the courts in November. PC Rowland is being backed by the wealthy Police Federation. Critics say the police should not be able to bring civil suits against members of the public, because it could stop them challenging an officer’s version of events.","Fresh evidence published today from police investigation into Plebgate .

"The parents of the innocent Brazilian shot dead by anti-terror police revealed last night they received £300,000 compensation from Scotland Yard – but want more after learning police ‘spied’ on them after the tragedy. The figure – far higher than previously thought – was disclosed by the couple as they said they would sue the force again over claims that undercover officers gathered private information about them after Jean Charles de Menezes was killed at Stockwell Tube station in South London in July 2005. In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail at their home, a modest smallholding near the remote town of Gonzaga in south-eastern Brazil, they said they felt ‘violated’ at the thought of the police intruding on their privacy as they were grieving. 'Violated': The parents of Jean Charles de Menezes, Matozinhos, 75, and Maria, 69, believe they deserve more . Mr de Menezes’s father Matozinhos Otomio da Silva, 75, said: ‘We are a humble couple, and since Jean’s death we have both suffered with our health. We don’t want to be greedy, but we could really do with some extra money.’ Mother Maria Otomio de Menezes, 69, said of the ‘spying’ claims: ‘It makes me feel sick. They ruined everything for us, and now we’re hearing that they didn’t even respect our right to grief in privacy. ‘There are no excuses that could justify that. Nobody has contacted us about this. ‘They probably think that because we’re poor Brazilians we won’t find out and we don’t need to know.’ Mr de Menezes, a 27-year-old electrician, was shot seven times in the head by officers who mistakenly thought he was a terrorist. An inquest jury later found the Met guilty of health and safety failings over its bungled operation but no officer faced criminal charges. Details of the privacy intrusion which allegedly followed the de Menezes tragedy were outlined in a damning report on the activities of a now disbanded Metropolitan Police undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS). Officers from the SDS collected information on 18 justice campaigns – including those concerning Mr de Menezes and the Stephen Lawrence case – which resulted in ‘collateral intrusion’ on family members. Shot by mistake: Jean Charles de Menezes . The Met said it regretted ‘enormously’ the distress caused. Mr de Menezes’ parents said they had not been officially informed of the allegations or received any correspondence from the Met since settling compensation with them in 2009, although their lawyers in London have been notified of the spying scandal. Mr de Menezes’s father said: ‘We went to London twice for the inquiry into Jean’s death, and both times our hotel rooms were booked and paid for by the police. ‘Now I’m wondering if we were being watched and listened to while we were in there. ‘It was the policemen who killed Jean who were being investigated, but now it turns out that Jean’s family and friends were being investigated. They admitted they’d got it wrong and Jean wasn’t a criminal, but then they treated us as if we were criminals. ‘I think it is unforgivable. If having our son taken from us wasn’t enough, they were also spying on our suffering and grief. It makes us feel violated. ‘We’re all told that Britain is a free country where people’s rights are respected, but we’ve seen something very different.’ The couple said that with the money they received from the Metropolitan Police, they bought a piece of land and a house in the nearby town of Gonzaga, which they rent out for £70 a month. Mr de Menezes’s mother added: ‘We wanted to leave something for our other son, Giovan, and our three grandchildren. As well as the rent we get our pensions, but it’s only enough to survive. ‘For our lives to really change for the better, we needed a lot more than what we got. But no amount of money could have paid for my son’s death. They could have offered me the whole of London, I would have preferred to have my son back here alive. ‘I’ve never understood why they killed him without even asking any questions. He was a hard-working lad who was just trying to make a life for himself, and help his family too. How did he end up being mistaken for a terrorist?’ In 2009, the Mail revealed the de Menezes family had reached an out-of-court settlement with the Met but would receive reduced compensation because they were so poor. Sources said the undisclosed six-figure award was scaled down on the grounds that they could not have expected much cash support from their son. Although the amount was covered by a confidentiality clause, sources said it would have been much higher if Mr de Menezes had left a widow and children or came from a wealthy family. But when he died his parents were subsistence farmers living in a dilapidated one-bedroom shack in the rainforest. Above the road into Gonzaga, a sign reads: ‘Land of Jean Charles de Menezes. Victim of terrorism in London. Here we value life.’ The parents of Stephen Lawrence – who received £320,000 from the Met for the blunders that blighted the initial police investigation into his murder – could also be in line for more compensation in the light of the spying allegations.","Parents of Jean Charles de Menezes received £300,000 from Scotland Yard .

"‘Cowboy’ parking squads hired by High Street firms are hitting hundreds of thousands of drivers with £100 ‘fines’ and using threats to make them pay up. The companies – employed by fast food chains, retailers and railway operators – issue what appear to be official penalty notices, similar to those used by council traffic wardens. They then extract huge sums from drivers who are sometimes just a few minutes late in returning to their cars. However, the tickets do not have the same legal standing as official fines. Many are being issued unfairly and – in some cases – without proper legal authority. Scroll down for video . Warning: A branch of McDonald’s Drive-Thru with parking restrictions advertised at the entrance . The ‘bounty hunter’ tactics are an unintended consequence of the outlawing of clamping on private land in 2012. Private firms who used to fleece motorists with clamps have simply switched tactics and now issue £100 tickets to those judged to have overstayed. But consumer groups say High Street names such as McDonald’s are letting their reputations be dragged through the mud due to their association with suspect firms hired to police their car parks. Have you been the victim of private parking cowboys? Contact the Daily Mail via parking@dailymail.co.uk . Some offer a limited free parking period while others charge. But the parking firms often issue tickets safe in the knowledge that many drivers will simply pay up even though they often have an excellent chance of winning an appeal. If tickets are ignored, firms often follow them up with threatening letters – sometimes purporting to be from baliffs. But the notices are not backed by criminal law and cannot be enforced without a County Court order. The Daily Mail can reveal that McDonald’s has a contract with MET Parking Services – which has links to an ‘unfit’ debt collection agency and a firm of solicitors which was shut down because of staff dishonesty. MET is contracted to make sure vehicles do not stay beyond a permitted time at 104 of the fast food giant’s car parks. But there have been claims that its wardens are placing £100 penalty notices on cars even when families are simply eating inside the restaurant. MET also polices 21 car parks belonging to Chiltern Railways, which runs services through Buckinghamshire to the West Midlands. Fast food chains, including McDonalds, shops and railway operators employ companies like MET Parking Services, who issue what appear to be official penalty notices, similar to those used by council traffic wardens . Last night Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘Private parking companies are part of a bounty hunting fad which has risen up over the past few years and is making an industry of penalising people without good reason or for their simple human mistakes. ‘Big brands like McDonald’s don’t seem to appreciate how this new industry operates or the sense of anger and injustice that it produces in its victims and who are also their own customers.’ AA president Edmund King said that ‘cowboy tactics, scaremongering and bullying’ were being used by many private parking companies. ‘Often motorists know that they are in the right but when they get a letter that looks like an official fixed penalty notice, followed by a letter that looks like an official bailiff’s letter, they pay up because they are scared.’ He said that the British Parking Association is paid for by the car parking industry, a situation akin to ‘inmates guarding the jail’. Retired Scotland Yard superintendent Bernie Gravett said: ‘MET Parking do not have staff on site. Rather they operate mobile patrols to rotate around a group of car parks. Their operative will walk into the car park and issue a Parking Charge Notice or PCN. ‘The PCN has all the appearance of a lawful Penalty Charge Notice issued by the authorities.’ In 2012, MET Parking was one of six firms that had their access to the DVLA database of number plates, names and addresses suspended for a period for issuing misleading information to motorists. If people refuse to pay the penalty fee, the company passes the case on to a debt recovery firm such as Roxburghe Debt Collection, of West Byfleet in Surrey. Wheel clamping on private land was made illegal two years ago following campaigns by the Daily Mail and motoring groups. As a result, most companies switched to using parking penalty notices. But many are wrongly applied, leading to thousands of drivers being chased for money they do not owe. The notices are not backed by criminal law and can be enforced only in the civil courts. A driver in a private car park is deemed to have accepted the rules and terms, providing these are spelt out clearly on substantial signs that can easily be seen. If they stay longer than allowed, they are deemed to have agreed to meet the appropriate sanction which can be a £100 penalty, cut to £50 for swift payment. A driver hit with an unfair penalty cannot be compelled to pay unless the company first gets an order from the County Court. The firms rarely do this as it is too expensive. Instead, they rely on threats of legal action. Earlier this year, Roxburghe was declared ‘unfit’ to hold a credit licence by the Office of Fair Trading. Its tactics include arranging for a solicitor’s letter to be sent to the driver, generally adding more than £200 in charges. Some of these were issued under the name of GPB Solicitors in Stratford-upon-Avon. Last October, the Solicitors Regulatory Authority looked into the firm’s practices and closed it down. It found there was ‘reason to suspect dishonesty’ on the part of an employee. Roxburghe is appealing against the OFT’s decision that it is ‘unfit’. Incredibly, its managing director is Gary Osner, who sits on the board of the British Parking Association, which, in theory, is responsible for policing parking companies. McDonald’s said: ‘All parking contractors that we work with are approved by the British Parking Association and are required to meet strict standards which address appropriate levels of charges and behaviours demanded from staff.’ MET Parking insisted its staff issue penalty notices only when they have good evidence that a driver has stayed beyond the permitted time. Chief executive David Marks said: ‘When we receive an appeal in respect of a charge notice that has been issued, we consider all the evidence provided, any mitigating circumstances and the decision process agreed in respect of each individual site with our clients. ‘Should the motorist’s appeal be unsuccessful we offer them the opportunity to appeal to POPLA, the independent appeals service.’ Roxburghe did not respond to requests for a comment. However, it issued a statement earlier this year saying: ‘We have consistently provided the highest levels of service to our clients and their customers.’ An 80-year-old diabetic was targeted by McDonald’s private parking wardens after suffering a medical emergency while parked at its outlet at Gatwick airport. Charlie Webley, right with his daughter Sharon, needed to wait at the restaurant longer than planned to ensure his blood sugar had stabilised before he could to drive on safely. Two days later a parking penalty notice arrived from MET Parking. It had captured the details of the car using automatic number plate recognition cameras and the official DVLA database. After the firm was told about his condition it doubled the charge from £50 to £100 because it was not paid within 14 days. Mr Webley, from Strood in Kent, had travelled to the airport last summer to pick up his daughter Sharon, who owns the car.

"Emily Fox was jailed for 15 months for her relationship with the teenage girl . A lesbian PE teacher at a leading private school was jailed for 15 months yesterday for sex acts with a girl of 15. Emily Fox, 26, exchanged hundreds of ‘sexually explicit’ messages with the girl. The pair struck up a friendship in late 2012 but from Easter last year developed an intense bond that involved kissing and later sexual touching, a court heard. Fox was a teacher at the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire – where fees are up to £25,000 a year. The relationship was discovered in August last year when a revealing email was printed inadvertently and seen by the parents of the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Fox, from Bath, last month admitted four counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust. The first count related to ‘touching by kissing’, the rest to more intimate touching. Sally Mealing-McLeod, prosecuting, told St Albans Crown Court that contact between the pair began in November 2012. She said: ‘Initially it was what one could really call a friendship. However, that changed around Easter 2013 and ... became far more intense.’ The prosecutor said the girl told the teacher ‘she loved her as a friend’. She said the matter came to light when the victim tried to print an email but the printer did not work. The prosecutor said: ‘A week later the father was using the printer when that document was printed. It clearly disclosed some sort of relationship.’ The prosecutor said an ‘abundance’ of evidence to support the charges was discovered in WhatsApp messages between the pair, including ones that were sexually explicit. ‘There are hundreds and hundreds of those messages,’ she added. Dee Connelly, mitigating, said Fox had shown bravery in admitting the offences. She had wanted to be a teacher from a young age and accepts her career is now ruined. Fox took an overdose in 2011 and suffered depression after her parents moved to America, the court heard. Judge Stephen Gullick told Fox he had no doubt she was a gifted teacher. But he said: ‘You were always aware that the relationship was not only wrong but also unlawful.’ He said that this type of behaviour was ‘extremely grave’. Fox, 26, (pictured left and right) had been teaching at the school for two years before striking up a friendship with the teenager. She was sentenced to 15 months in prison at court yesterday after earlier pleading guilty to various counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust . Abuse of trust: Fox was a games teacher at the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Herfordshire when she had sex with a student . He . sentenced Fox to concurrent sentences of one month, six months and two . of 15 months. She will also be on  the sex offenders’ register for ten . years. Fox dabbed tears from her eyes as she sat in the dock. She shrugged to her parents as she left the court.","Emily Fox exchanged hundreds of 'explicit' messages with pupil .

"A British tourist whose leg was severed when a New York taxi driver lost control and pinned her against a wall is now out of intensive care. Sian Green, 23, has started rehabilitation for her injuries following the crash in late August. Her lawyer said leaving the ICU ward Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan's Kips Bay, and beginning her rehabilitation marked a 'milestone in her recovery'. Lawyer Daniel Marchese also said Ms Green was in good spirits, according to NBC New York. Miss Green, from Leicester, was starting a holiday in the Big Apple with her friend Keshia Warren, when the horrific incident happened. The girls were eating hot dogs outside the Rockefeller Centre, on Sixth Avenue, when the unlicensed yellow cab driver mounted the curb and crushed her. Scroll down for video... On holiday: Sian Green, right, is now beginning rehab and has left the intensive care unit after her leg was severed when a taxi mounted the pavement in Manhattan, New York City, last month. She was eating a hot dog dog with friend Keshia Warren, left, on the first day of their holiday . Both her legs were severely injured; one was severed at the shin. Taxi driver Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon, 24, has defended his actions, saying 'it's not my fault,' it's just accident'. (sic) He has argued that he accelerated away from cyclist, Kenneth Olivo, 'who attacked his vehicle' because he was afraid he was going to be assaulted. Olivo, 40, of Manhattan, had recently spent 10 days in jail after pleading guilty in April to menacing after accidentally kicking a dog and then telling the owner's friend that he would 'kill you and your family'. He also has been arrested at least 24 times in the past - but has not been charged over the incident that saw driver Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon injure the part-time model Miss Green.

The 24-year-old cabbie was not licensed to drive the cab he was using and was originally said to have been arguing with a cyclist when he tried to step on the brake but hit the accelerator instead. Initial action was taken by the Taxi and Limousine Commission to suspend his licence, and although he only got a summons after the accident, he could eventually be given felony charges. The incident happened on August 20 and Miss Green, a fashion buyer graduate from De Montfort University, has been in intensive care ever since. After the crash, her friend Miss Warren wept as she desperately tried to stem the flow of blood from Miss Green’s legs with a passer-by’s dog leash.

"The married socialite expecting Simon Cowell’s baby was accused of being a ‘gold digger’ on Thursday. Lauren Silverman has allegedly issued the X Factor boss with a string of outrageous demands, telling him she wants marriage and her own reality TV show before she will allow him access to the child. And in divorce papers filed two weeks ago by her estranged spouse Andrew Silverman, Lauren was accused of being 'cruel and inhuman' towards her husband. Despite the controversy surrounding her, Lauren looked in good spirits and smiled for the cameras as she made her first public appearance since news of the unplanned pregnancy broke on Wednesday morning. Scroll down for video . Carrying on as per usual: Lauren Silverman was seen visiting a shop near her home in New York on Thursday amid reports of 'gold digging' behaviour . In an official statement later that day, Lauren said: 'I am committed to sorting things out with Andrew as amicably as possible to ensure the well-being of our son. I would hope for some space and privacy in order to work through this.' Her lawyers, Robert Cohen and Bernard Clair of Cohen Clair Lans Greifer & Thorpe LLP, added: 'We are working to resolve this situation in a fair and reasonable way that protects the best interests of our client and her son.' MailOnline can reveal that Lauren and her estranged husband Andrew worked together to co-ordinate their statements, each emphasising that their seven-year-old son Adam was their joint priority. Agreement: It's thought that Simon tried to reach an agreement with Lauren before the story went public . Mr Silverman's stated: 'My top priority is protecting my seven . year old son while working to resolve all outstanding issues with my . wife.  Hopefully people can respect the interest of our child during . this process.' However, Mr Silverman's brother, . Alexander, said what had unfolded in the last few days was ‘an . unbelievable story of betrayal. It is a sad story and a tragic story’. Mrs Silverman, 36, had been holed up . with her mother Carole and son at the £2.5million . family home in the Hamptons, New York. Cool character: Lauren looked unfazed about the drama surrounding her love-life as she popped to the shops . Mrs Silverman, who is said to be . ten weeks pregnant, emerged to walk her son to his school bus wearing a white linen blouse which seemed to . hint at a slight bump underneath. She later stepped out in a black clinging linen dress. Meanwhile Cowell, 53, faced the press for the first time since the news broke at a television studio 2,500 miles away in Los Angeles. He . refused to answer questions about the baby at an ill-timed X Factor . press conference, instead calling the matter 'private' and insisting the matter was 'sensitive'. Stride: Lauren wore a black maxi dress featuring a split up one side which revealed her leg as she walked . TV star: Lauren reportedly is keen to have her own show like the Kardashians . It has emerged . that Mr Silverman has cited Cowell in divorce . papers. The move, clearly designed to embarrass Cowell, could potentially force him to reveal details of the alleged affair in court. And a friend claimed that the . Silvermans were far from being an ‘estranged couple’, as has been . suggested. Breaking cover: Simon Cowell was peppered with questions about the pregnancy at an ill-times X Factor press conference in Beverly Hills on Thursday; he told the press it was 'private' Still smiling: Cowell looked in good spirits despite the controversy surrounding his personal life . It is claimed Mr Silverman, a real-estate developer and . millionaire casino owner, recently upgraded his wife’s engagement ring . with a ten-carat diamond. Yesterday Mrs Silverman was accused . of issuing Cowell with a string of demands – but the claims made against . her are alleged to have come from Cowell’s supporters, so could be . designed to win favour for the multi-millionaire. A source claimed: ‘Lauren is now . going around telling people that she will be in charge of all his . [Cowell’s] properties around the world and has demanded a country home . in the Cotswolds. Motherly support: Lauren was spotted shopping with her mother Carole, who could have passed as she her sister, on Thursday . All smiles: The married socialite, who is pregnant with Simon Cowell's child, seen leaving a holiday home in the Hamptons with her son on Thursday morning . She has also threatened not to allow him access to the child unless he marries her. ‘Lauren has also started to push Simon to turn her into a reality TV . star. She wants her own show like the Kardashians and has already . apparently started filming the pregnancy. 'Simon is horrified and has . said no. He [Cowell] is already talking about creating separate baby . wings in all his homes for Lauren and the baby. ‘His mansions are huge and he will effectively be allowed to carry on with his own life without disruption. ‘He has no problems looking after his . heir apparent – that is all he is interested in and he will ensure . Lauren has a roof over her head in order to raise his child.’ Happy: Lauren looked completely carefree and showed a hint of bump in her white shirt as she left the home where she is spending time over the summer with her son . Shy: Andrew Silverman kept his head down after a source closed to Cowell told MailOnline that Andrew named him in the divorce ‘to cause the utmost embarrassment’ to the star . Others around Cowell, who is believed to be worth £225million, claimed a wedding was not on the cards. One said: ‘Simon does NOT, NOT, NOT . plan to get married to her [Lauren]. Simon is gearing up for a . potentially ugly child support battle. ‘He tried desperately to reach an agreement with Lauren before it went public but she surprised Simon and leaked the news. ‘Simon was hoping to reach a . financial agreement with her and then release a joint statement but . Lauren is savvy and wants to be famous and when he refused her opening . demands for marriage she leaked it.’ Her first husband: The former couple's divorce was finalised December 6, which granted them joint custody of their eight-year-old son . Cowell and Miss Silverman are said to . have first met on holiday in Barbados around seven years ago, and . struck up a relationship around 12 months ago. Even the music mogul’s closest friends were unaware that they were seeing one another. Cowell could be hauled in front of a US court to give evidence about his . affair with his former friend’s wife after being listed on court papers . as co-respondent. Lauren posted a picture of the pair of them together to her Instagram page cuddled up together during a holiday. Along with the picture she wrote: ''Me and my lil Simey monster #simoncowell x' Mr Silverman, 37, is understood to have learned his wife was expecting . Cowell’s baby only last month. He filed the papers at Manhattan’s . Supreme Court on July 15. Brave face: Cowell's former fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy smiled widely as she arrived at his home in Beverly Hills following the baby news being made public . She's still all white: Mezhgan headed inside the house to chat to Cowell . New York is a no-fault divorce state, meaning that couples do not need a reason to end their marriage. But Mr Silverman is said to feel so betrayed by his wife and his . long-term friend that he has filed for a divorce on the grounds of . adultery in an attempt to shame the pair in public. This is heavily discouraged by  lawyers because of the huge costs and the often bitter fallout it causes between couples. Demands: Lauren has reportedly asked Simon, pictured leaving an LA studio on Wednesday, for her own TV show . Under US law, Mr Silverman is required to prove his wife’s infidelity, . even if she and Cowell admit to the affair. It means Cowell would have . to reveal evidence of his meetings with Mrs Silverman, such as hotel . receipts and text messages. He would also have to take a paternity test to show whether or not the . baby was his. If adultery is proved, he will be asked to foot Mr . Silverman’s legal bills, which could come to more than £200,000. A source close to Cowell told the Daily Mail last night: ‘This has all . turned into a mess for him. This is not the way in which he wanted it to . come out. He is now worried about the sponsorship deals he has for his . various shows. Naught minx: Lauren's ex-husband Andew Silverman - pictured with the couple last year - cited adultery as the reason for their divorce and named The X Factor star as a 'co-correspondent' History: In October 2012 the pair were pictured house hunting alongside som friends in Los Angeles . ‘Companies like Pepsi are not going to be pleased with the headlines about Cowell fathering a child with a married woman. ‘His sponsors could argue that he has brought their brands into disrepute. ‘Many aren’t particularly happy about being associated with his shows as . they are struggling with ratings and they could now use this as an . excuse to break out of their contracts. Simon is now worried he may lose . valuable sources of income.’ Representatives for Cowell refused to comment last night.","Lauren branded 'cruel and inhuman' to her husband in divorce papers .

Miss Green – who said she was determined not to let the injuries ruin her life - was taken to Bellevue Hospital in New York where she is now recovering after surgery. Mr Justino, 44, said Miss Green was a ‘strong girl, a brave girl’. ‘From the shin down, it was gone,’ he added. ‘He hit the girl, she flew up in the air. ‘Her left leg was severed, the other was mangled. So I just grabbed my belt, went over, lifted her up, put it on, held it. She was conscious the whole time, the poor thing. I wished she had passed out.’ Last night, Miss Green’s parents Jason and Sonia said their daughter was ‘being very strong’ as she started to come to terms with what had happened. At their semi-detached family home in Leicester, locksmith Mr Green, 42, said:  ‘She is in recovery now and they have had to amputate what’s left of her foot.

Himon is originally from Bangladesh but now lives in the Bronx. The New York Post also revealed that the taxi driver injured a passenger in a crash in 2010, which was the first year he worked as a taxi driver in the city. Later that year he was also fined $50 (£32), before getting nine points and $415 (£266) in fines for three violations in 2011. He ran a red light, did 65 in a 45mph zone and performed an illegal turn.","Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon, 24, injured Sian Green, 24, on Tuesday .

"Arrested: Lauri Love, from Suffolk, is alleged to have stolen 'massive amounts' of confidential information, including details of military servicemen, by breaking into thousands of computers . The British son of a Baptist minister has been arrested and charged with hacking into the computer networks of the US military and Nasa, causing millions of dollars of damage. Lauri Love, an activist in the Occupy movement, is alleged to have stolen ‘massive amounts’ of confidential information – including details of military servicemen – by breaking into thousands of computers. The 28-year-old from Stradishall, Suffolk, is said to have bragged in messages with his co-conspirators: ‘You have no idea how much we can f*** with the US government if we wanted to’. Neighbours of his family spoke of their shock at seeing him arrested in the quiet, rural community. Love was described as a ‘sophisticated . and prolific’ hacker in court documents filed in New Jersey, where he is . charged with one count of accessing a US department or agency computer . without permission and another charge of conspiracy. He was arrested . on Friday at his parents’ semi-detached home in Suffolk, from where he . is thought to have hacked the computers. The operation was carried out by the National Crime Agency, the new elite force known as 'Britain's FBI'. Love could be extradited to the . US, where if convicted he faces up to ten years in prison and a fine . for twice the damage caused. The US government said Love worked with . two other people in Australia and one in Sweden – who have not been . charged – ‘to disrupt the operations and infrastructure’ of the federal . government. From October 2012 until July this year it is claimed he . hacked into thousands of government computer systems – including those . of the US Army, US Missile Defense Agency and Nasa – and left behind . ‘back doors’ through which he could return to get sensitive data. The . hacking ‘substantially impaired the functioning of dozens of computer . servers’ and caused ‘millions of dollars in damage’ to government . agencies, according to the indictment. It includes pieces of instant . message conversations Love allegedly had with his partners as the hacks . took place. In one from July [2013], he seems to brag about infiltrating . Nasa networks. He allegedly wrote: ‘lol Nasa. Ahaha, we owning lots of . Nasa sites … I think we can do some hilarious stuff with it.’ In . another post, he wrote: ‘This stuff is really sensitive. It’s basically . every piece of information you’d need to do full identity theft on any . employee or contractor for the [government agency].’ It is claimed that . Love, who used the online pseudonyms ‘nsh’, ‘route’, ‘peace’, ‘shift’ and ‘love’, planned to use social media, including Twitter, to publicise . the attacks. Scroll down for video . Love, 28, photographed here during an Occupy protest at Glasgow University, has been charged with allegedly hacking into the computer systems of the United States army, Nasa and other federal agencies . In one message he planned to announce an attack ‘so it . rolls along the morning news in US and gets Europe for the afternoon and . evening.’ Last night, at his parents’ home, Love said after being . released on bail: ‘I can’t say anything right now. I only just got home . after being at government headquarters today. ‘My dad is ill and my . parents both work at the prison so it wouldn’t be fair on them to talk . about what’s going on with all this just at this moment.’ Love’s . father Alexander Love, 60, a Baptist minister, works as a chaplain at . HMP Highpoint North. His mother Sirkka-Liisa Love, 59, also works at the . category C prison as a teacher. Last night neighbours in the small . Suffolk village told of their shock at the allegations. Student Kayleigh Streeton, 18, said: 'My brother came home and saw police cars park up outside and they were taking computers away. 'We knew there was something going on but it wasn't until we heard it on the news that we realised what he was accused of. 'You didn't see him around the estate much and, when you do see him out, he mostly keeps to himself. His parents are friendly with their neighbours and they seem like nice people.' Another resident said: 'We didn't have any suspicions and to think something like that might have happened under our noses is certainly a surprise.' Love’s father, who is Scottish, was previously . minister at the London Road Baptist Church in Lowestoft. A worshipper . there said: ‘Alexander was a very respected minister in the town.’ Raid: Love was arrested at his parent's home in the village of Stradishall on Friday from where he is thought to have hacked the computers . Love . was a leader in protests at Glasgow University, where he was a student. He helped organise demonstrations including a . sit-in as part of a protest against cuts to higher education. He is also believed to have been a high-profile figure in the Scottish Occupy movement, part of the protests which swept throughout much of the world in 2011, and has been pictured at Occupy marches. Love, who is believed to have studied physics, maths and computing, was apparently involved in 2011's 'Hetherington House Occupation', in which dozens of protesters took over an unused university building in Glasgow and stayed there for seven months. The . charges against Love were filed at the federal court in Newark, New Jersey, because he  allegedly used a server in the state as part of his activities. He . also faces charges in Virginia for other alleged intrusions. The . National Crime Agency said Love had been arrested under the . Computer Misuse Act and had been released on bail until February. Daniel . Andrews, director of the US Army’s computer crime investigative unit, . said: ‘Computer intrusions present significant risks to national . security and our military operations.’ In the past, convicted hackers and leakers have faced stiff penalties in the U.S. - former soldier Bradley Manning, now known as Chelsea, was this year sentenced to 35 years in prison for passing official secrets to WikiLeaks. Gary McKinnon was not extradited to the United States to face hacking charges . Lauri Love's indictment for allegedly hacking into U.S. government computers has raised parallels to the case of Gary McKinnon, who fought a 10-year battle to avoid being extradited to America. Mr McKinnon, from Wood Green, North London, was first arrested in 2002 after U.S. authorities told the police that he had hacked into military computer systems, deleting key files and leaving a message saying: 'Your security is c***.' The American government insisted that the 47-year-old was a grave threat to national security - but Mr McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome, said that he was searching for proof that the authorities had covered up the existence of aliens. In 2005, Mr McKinnon was placed on bail following the signing of a controversial new treaty which allows the U.S. to request the extradition of suspects from Britain without having to provide solid evidence of their guilt. He would have faced up to 70 years in prison if convicted of hacking - and said he feared he could be sent to the terrorist prison camp in Guantanamo Bay. Medical experts said that he would be very likely to kill himself if confined to an American prison. Mr McKinnon fought a decade-long legal battle, backed by supporters including the Daily Mail, but was defeated in the House of Lords, the High Court and the European Court of Human Rights. However, in October last year Home Secretary Theresa May blocked his extradition on the grounds that it would be 'incompatible with Mr McKinnon's human rights' due to the high suicide risk. Two months later, he learned that he would not stand trial in Britain either. Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, ruled that the chances of a successful conviction were 'not high' and that it was therefore not in the public interest to pursue Mr McKinnon further.

"High-life: Nadir and Nur in 2010 . Conman Asil Nadir was awarded nearly £2million in legal aid during his marathon trial, official figures revealed last night. The runaway tycoon’s lawyers racked up a £1,987,743 bill at taxpayers’ expense – as he flaunted his wealth by renting a £23,000-a-month central London property and giving his young wife a new Range Rover. Details of the 73-year-old’s enormous legal aid bill, revealed following a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mail, will reignite the row about ‘fat cat’ defence lawyers who earn vast amounts from the public purse. Nadir – who is now in jail in the UK –  stole almost £29million from his Polly Peck empire, then fled to his native Cyprus before returning in 2010 and vowing to clear his name in court. Despite claiming to be a penniless bankrupt, he was chauffeured to the Old Bailey every day during his seven-month trial in a gleaming Jaguar. His glamorous wife Nur – 43 years his junior – was regularly seen shopping in the designer boutiques of Bond Street as her husband sat in the dock. Wearing her trademark Chanel sunglasses, Cartier watch and favourite £4,000 Hermes Kelly handbag, she was seen strutting through the West End carrying expensive purchases from Harrods. Her mid-trial birthday present from her husband – a Range Rover Vogue – had a personal number plate AN02NUR, standing for ‘Asil Nadir love to Nur’. But despite assembling a high-powered legal team, Nadir was convicted of plundering tens of millions from Polly Peck and jailed for ten years in 2012. He was ordered to pay £5million compensation or face a further six years jail. Last night the Serious Fraud Office said the £5million payment had now been made ‘in full’ but was unable to say how the supposedly broke tycoon had paid up. A spokesman said: ‘You would have to ask Mr Nadir himself.’ Nadir built Polly Peck from an East End rag trade company into one listed on the FTSE 100 during the Thatcher boom years. It collapsed when he was arrested by the SFO in 1990. Three years later, while awaiting trial on 66 counts of theft, he fled Britain in the middle of the night for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. After 17 years, he returned to the UK in a private jet. Owing to the complexity of the case, his trial did not start until January 2012. The jury found he raided the company to pay for his multi-million-pound property empire, racehorses, antiques, fast cars and jewellery. But on the orders of the judge, he will have to serve only half of his sentence, meaning he is eligible for release in August 2017. Fraud investigators suspect Nadir has tens of millions of pounds stashed away in secret accounts or offshore trusts. Asil Nadir pictured arriving at the Old Bailey with his wife Nur during his trial in 2012. The 73-year-old was convicted of plundering tens of millions from his Polly Peck empire and jailed for ten years . He could even be returned to Cyprus – where he has a £3million villa – before 2017 if he makes a successful application under the ‘prisoner transfer’ scheme. In the 1980s Nadir donated £440,000 to the Conservative Party which it has refused to return despite his conviction. Allowing him to go home might leave the Government open to charges it was doing a favour for a disgraced former party donor – meaning it is unlikely he will be repatriated before the General Election next year. According to the Ministry of Justice, Nadir’s solicitors earned a total of £769,352 and charged a further £189,303 in ‘disbursements’ for defending the disgraced tycoon. His barristers received £1,029,088. When he was convicted two years ago, his wife Nur said he was innocent and announced he would appeal, which could land taxpayers with a further multi-million-pound bill. It was thought his Kuwait-born wife planned to stay here while her husband’s appeal is heard before returning to Northern Cyprus. But reports emerged last November in the Turkish-language media, that she was demanding a £5million divorce. Last night, she dismissed the claims, telling the Mail: ‘No, I have not divorced Mr Nadir.’ The Ministry of Justice said that since Nadir’s conviction, the Legal Aid Agency had recovered £153,039 from him, towards his legal costs. It added: ‘We absolutely agree legal aid costs must represent better value. We are cutting fees in criminal legal aid cases.’ Nadir’s lawyer did not respond to questions from the Mail.","Asil Nadir was awarded nearly £2million in legal aid during marathon trial .

"Ready to rock: Liam Gallagher after his band Beady Eye's gig in Ibiza on Wednesday. He has been told not to come home by his wife - for now... Liam Gallagher’s furious wife has banned him from home following allegations he fathered a love child, it was claimed yesterday. All Saints singer Nicole Appleton is said to be livid at reports her rock star husband has a secret baby with a New York Times journalist. A friend said: ‘Nicole has told Liam not to come home, at least not for a few weeks, and is furious.’ There was no sign of Miss Appleton, 38, at the couple’s £2.7million five-bedroom townhouse in Hampstead, North London yesterday. Gallagher, 40, is in Spain, where he appeared unfazed as he downed cocktails. He was being comforted by a mystery brunette in a black bikini, who stroked his head as they lay beside a hotel pool in Ibiza. Starting at 11.30am, the former Oasis frontman drank more than a dozen mojitos and several tequila shots as he laughed and joked with friends. The previous night his new band Beady Eye had performed at the Ibiza Rocks festival. Afterwards he was said to have looked ‘happy and relaxed’ as he mingled with female fans and posed for photographs at Pikes Hotel, a favourite celebrity haunt in San Antonio, and danced topless on his room balcony, which overlooks the bar, until 2.30am. Gallagher, who will fly to Alicante today to play at the Benicassim festival, has made no public comment on what his spokesman says is ‘gossip’. The seven-month-old girl, Emma, was born in January to blonde showbusiness writer Liza Ghorbani following a long-running affair, according to the New York Post. Last year Gallagher bought a £1.6million apartment in New York, close to Central Park and not far from where Emma is being raised. Gallagher has ‘admitted she is a beautiful child because she has “rock star genes”’, the New York Post claimed. It alleged Gallagher’s relationship with Miss Ghorbani ended only after Emma was born. Their trysts began after the music journalist met the former Oasis frontman in 2010 and wrote a glowing interview for the New York Times, entitled A Night Out With Liam Gallagher. The simpering article recounted how the British singer ‘turned heads’ at the Ritz-Carlton hotel bar and ‘sauntered’ down Central Park West looking like ‘he’d just stepped off Carnaby Street in London circa 1969’. Unmarried Miss Ghorbani, 39, has told friends their affair ended and then resumed again, according to another newspaper, the New York Daily News. It quoted a friend as saying: ‘It went on until she told him she was pregnant. He cut it off. He was so paranoid his wife would find out.’ Scroll down for video . 'Livid': Miss Appleton, left, and Gallagher have a 12-year-old son. They were married in 2008. It has been claimed his affair with Miss Ghorbani began after she profiled him for the New York Times . Gallagher has taken steps to prevent the story spreading, instructing London law firm Harbottle & Lewis to write warning letters to newspapers making inquiries about the singer’s reaction to the claims. He is also reported to have hired a lawyer in New York to defend himself against a paternity suit brought by Miss Ghorbani at the Manhattan Family Court. She is  alleged to be seeking £2million. After paying for the medical costs of the birth herself, Miss Ghorbani began the legal action and arranged a DNA test for her baby. Gallagher’s lawyers are taking unspecified ‘action’ against the New York Post for naming him as the father, but yesterday it made further claims. A source told the newspaper: ‘Liza met Liam when she interviewed him and they began an affair [which] continued until around three months after the birth of the child. He ended the relationship when she told him she was suing him for child support. Simpering: The glowing New York Times profile of Gallagher written by . Miss Ghorbani describing how the British singer 'turned heads' at the . Ritz-Carlton . ‘Liza isn’t after millions of dollars, she is simply seeking child support and no amount has yet been set. If they don’t settle on a figure, the case will go to a public trial.’ Miss Ghorbani, who specialises in interviewing rock stars, was not at her Manhattan apartment yesterday. She was said to be staying with her parents at their £500,000 house in McLean, Virginia. Her mother Sylvia, 63 – who was born in Lancashire and moved to America aged 19 – declined to comment. She is a teacher at a local school, while her husband, Iranian-born Daryoush, 65, runs his own mobile home business. Friends claim that Gallagher left it to another family member to break the news of the love child allegations to his mother. A source said: ‘They thought Liam should have done it himself. ‘His family have also advised Liam to see a top lawyer for the court case – and to consult a top divorce lawyer as well. ‘They are concerned for Liam. They say he’s “chaos” and that they are worried that he won’t stop his partying lifestyle until he makes himself ill.’ Friends of Canadian-born Miss Appleton say she never suspected her husband would be unfaithful despite wide-spread reports of him cheating on his first wife. Gallagher married his first wife, actress Patsy Kensit, in 1997. But only a couple of months later he fathered a child with singer Lisa Moorish. Their daughter Molly is now 15. Gallagher and Miss Kensit had a son, Lennon, now 13, in 1999. In 2001, Gallagher had another son, Gene, now 12, with Miss Appleton, whom he married in 2008. In the same year, Gallagher boasted he was a ‘top dad’ who had turned his back on a rock’n’roll lifestyle to be there for his family. The singer revealed he had never intended to become a father but insisted: ‘Once you get your missus pregnant, you’ve got to step up to the plate.’","Former Oasis singer told not to come home - 'at least for a few weeks'

"Former Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell is facing a large tax bill after investing in a children’s film based on the comic-strip cat Garfield, it emerged last night. The ex-Government chief whip has been identified as an investor in a film-financing company which has been declared a tax avoidance scheme by the authorities. People who invested in the scheme are to receive ‘accelerated payment notices’, ordering them to settle up. Among them is Mr Mitchell who put money into a film called Garfield: A Tale Of Two Kitties. The 2006 ‘semi-comedic romp’ was  savaged by critics. Investor: Former Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell is facing a large tax bill after investing in a children's film based on the comic-strip cat Garfield . Other movies which benefited from his cash included X-Men: The Last Stand, according to BBC2’s Newsnight programme. Last night it was unclear how much money Mr Mitchell, who resigned from Government over the notorious ‘Plebgate’ incident, will be told to pay. But the debt could not come at a worse time for the Tory MP, who is involved in two potentially expensive libel actions. The politician is suing The Sun newspaper over its original report about his row with a diplomatic protection officer called Toby Rowland, whom he allegedly called a ‘****ing pleb’ at the gates of Downing Street. Mr Mitchell denies he used the word ‘pleb’. PC Rowland is, in turn, suing Mr Mitchell over comments he made about him at a televised press conference last year. However there is mounting speculation that Mr Rowland’s legal proceedings against Mr Mitchell could be dropped, following negotiations involving the Association of Chief Police Officers. Mr Mitchell’s case against The Sun remains scheduled for the High Court in December. According to Newsnight, Mr Mitchell – a former investment banker whose wealth was  estimated to be £2.2million in 2012 – invested in Ingenious Film Partners 2 in the 2000s. According to its promoters, it was a vehicle that encouraged people to invest in British film. But according to HMRC, it was created to generate inappropriate amounts of tax relief for its investors. Film: Mr Mitchell put money into a film called Garfield: A Tale Of Two Kitties. The 2006 'semi-comedic romp' was  savaged by critics . This week, HMRC listed Ingenious Film Partners 2 as one of 1,200 candidates for ‘accelerated payment notices’. This is a power that takes effect this week meaning that investors can be asked to repay all tax that HMRC thinks they should have paid before going to court. Other well-known figures who invested in Ingenious Film Partners 2 include William (now Lord) Waldegrave, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, and Michael Grade, former chairman of the BBC. All insist they invested in the scheme to support the film industry. Ingenious said: ‘HMRC has failed to distinguish between commercial businesses and tax avoidance schemes and have, without proper consideration, deemed all film arrangements to be tax schemes.’ As a minimum, investors in Ingenious Film Partners 2 could put in £36,000. If they put in that much, Ingenious would then loan them a further £64,000 to invest, taking their stake up to £100,000. That would be used to buy shares in film productions which, in their first year, created a £90,000 loss. According to Newsnight, top-rate taxpayers who invested in the scheme could choose to write off that loss against their taxes. This meant that in return for putting in £36,000 in cash, they would get about the same amount in tax relief very fast – and end up owning a £100,000 stake in a group of films. If it is challenged and HMRC wins a subsequent case, the Revenue can keep the money. If it loses, it must refund the cost of the process. Mr Mitchell said: ‘When the last Labour Government introduced tax incentives to invest in the British film industry, along with many other investors, I did so through Ingenious Films. I resigned from Ingenious when I was in Government and always pay all tax when due.’ Lord Grade said: ‘The Labour Government at the time promoted a policy to stimulate investment in the British film industry through tax incentives. The Ingenious Fund gave effect to this policy.’ Lord Waldegrave said: ‘It was presented as a genuine film investment partnership.

"Provocative: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange addresses a meeting . at the United Nations in New York via videolink from Ecuador's . London embassy . David Cameron faced acute embarrassment last night as Wikileaks fugitive Julian Assange mocked Britain in an address to the United Nations in which he bragged about being a ‘free man'. The leaks campaigner addressed a UN meeting in New York over a satellite link from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Speaking via videolink from the embassy study, Assange said: ‘I speak to you today as a free man because despite having been detained for 659 days without charge, I am free in the most basic and important sense - I am free to speak my mind. ‘It is thanks to the United Nations that I’m able to exercise my inalienable right to seek protection from this arbitrary and excessive action taken by governments against me and the staff and supporters of my organisation’. Mr Cameron had earlier addressed the UN General Assembly on the second day of his visit to New York calling for greater backing for ‘emerging democracies’ in the Arab world. But fears that his speech would be overshadowed by the Wikileaks campaigner were borne out when Mr Assange accused the United States of persecuting his organisation and torturing Bradley Manning, the US private accused of supplying WikiLeaks with hundreds of sensitive diplomatic and military cables. The Wikileaks founder’s speech came as it emerged that Ecuador’s foreign minister plans to hold talks with the UK Government tomorrow to try to resolve the deadlock over Assange’s continued presence at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Addressing a UN conference called ‘Strengthening Human Rights’, in his typical grandstanding style, Assange spent 14 minutes railing railing against the US government for investigating WikiLeaks - and claimed credit for sparking the Arab Spring. He accused the US government of detaining Bradley Manning without charge and mistreating him - telling the UN that Manning was ‘degraded, abused and psychologically tortured.’. Scroll down to watch Julian Assange's appearance at the UN... 'Degraded, abused and psychologically tortured': . Assange last night accused the US government of detaining Bradley . Manning, the alleged source of Wikileaks' embassy cables, without charge and mistreating him . Assange also accused the United States . of harassing his organisation claiming the ‘FBI produced 42,135 pages . of WikiLeaks-related activity; less than 8,000 concern Manning’. In his speech Assange said the US was ‘trying to erect a national regime of secrecy, a national regime of obfuscation’. He tore into President Obama and said that he was ‘distorting’ facts ‘for his own gain’. Assange said: ‘There is a time for action and a time for words. The time for words has run out. ‘It is time for the US to cease its . persecution of WikiLeaks, to cease its persecution of our people and to . cease its persecution of our alleged sources. Assange, an Australian national, . spoke on the day that it emerged he has been labelled an ‘enemy of the . state’ by the US government. The classification, which puts him in . the same bracket as Al Qaeda, means he could face the death penalty if . convicted of a crime in America. Embarrassed: Prime Minister David Cameron had earlier spoken to the UN on the second day of his visit to New York calling for greater backing for 'emerging democracies' in the Arab world . Big moment ruined: Fears that Mr Cameron's speech would be . overshadowed by the Wikileaks campaigner were borne out when Mr Assange . accused the United States of persecuting his organisation . Today marks 100 days since Mr Assange . sought political asylum in an effort to avoid extradition to Sweden . where he is wanted on rape and sex abuse charges. Mr . Assange arrived at the embassy on June 19, after a court ruled he could . be sent for trial. During his appeal, which went all the way to the . Supreme Court, he was allowed out on bail and since losing the case he . has refused to leave the embassy . An official from the Ecuadorian . embassy said that foreign minister Ricardo Patino planned to meet UK . Foreign Secretary William Hague at the United Nations in New York . tomorrow. He said: ‘We hope . that tomorrow’s meeting will mark the beginning of a new chapter in . seeking a solution to the present situation. ‘For . the part of the Ecuadorian government we are more than willing to find . an amicable answer that respects the values of international human . rights and the integrity of sovereign nations.’ A Foreign Office spokesman also confirmed the meeting was scheduled to take place tomorrow. Dozens of police officers have been on . guard outside the building in Knightsbridge, central London, ever since . - at huge cost to taxpayers. Police outside the Ecuadorian embassy last month: Mr Assange was granted political asylum by the government of Ecuador last month and has remained in the embassy ever since . It is thought the saga has already cost taxpayers some £1million in court, legal and policing costs. Mr . Assange claims he fears extradition to the United States over the . activities of the whistle-blowing website if he travels to Sweden. He was granted political asylum by the government of Ecuador last month and has remained in the embassy ever since. Ecuador’s foreign minister Ricardo . Pantino also addressed the United Nations yesterday on the subject of . political asylum, referring specifically to the Assange case. Mr Assange is thought to be planning an appeal to the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which could delay the process by years. Ecuador has called for Britain to allow Mr Assange safe passage to the South American country. But the Government has made clear he must be arrested if he steps outside the building. The Foreign Office was left humiliated when Ecuador published a letter in which British diplomats threatened to storm the embassy and arrest Mr Assange if he refused to come out.","Wikileaks founder spoke to a meeting of the UN in New York via satellite link .

"Rush job: JK Rowling has admitted to rushing some of the Harry Potter books to meet tight publishing deadlines . The Harry Potter novels won her millions of readers, not to mention untold riches. But JK Rowling says she is still not happy with them – and may yet rewrite some sections. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: ‘You think, “God I wish I’d had another year to rework it”. There were a couple of the Potters where I definitely knew they needed another year, where I had to write on the run. ‘I read them and I think “Oh God”. Maybe I’ll go back and do a “director’s cut”, I don’t know.’ Miss Rowling, 47, was speaking ahead of the publication of her first adult novel, The Casual Vacancy. She said this book was inspired by her own mental health problems. She has previously spoken about how she considered suicide in the 1990s while living in Edinburgh and suffering from depression. In an interview with US TV network ABC, Miss Rowling said she had ‘compulsions’ as a teenager. She said: ‘We have an adult character in the book who has obsessive compulsive disorder. These are things I know from the inside. When I was in my teens I had issues with OCD. ‘Compulsions, like checking things, it was very common. Double checking, triple checking. It’s an anxiety disorder.’ The mother of three, who has built up an estimated £560million fortune through the Potter books, said she has not felt depressed for ‘more than a decade’ since she started writing them. She said: ‘It cheered me up a lot. Harry gave me a job to do that I loved more than anything else.’ Miss Rowling told the BBC it was ‘very likely’ her next book will be for children. She has previously admitted that the . pressure of following up the seven Harry Potter novels led her to . consider publishing The Casual Vacancy under a pseudonym, although she . later decided that it would be ‘braver’ to be honest. Daniel Radcliffe in the title role in the cinema . adaptation of Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince: The series has . made Miss Rowling a multi-millionairess . Miss Rowling told the BBC that her . life as a single mother in the early Nineties informed much of the class . issues in her latest opus, which she feels reflects the situation today . in austerity-stricken Britain. 'I would say there's a whiff of the . early-Nineties about the way these issues are being discussed right now. It's painfully familiar to me,' she said. 'In hard times the desire to . stigmatise and to blame seems to become ever stronger.' Days before its official launch, . excerpts from her first book in the post-Harry Potter era began to . emerge online – and it is clear that it is for grown-up eyes only. Adult themes: Miss Rowling's latest book The Casual Vacancy hits bookseller's shelves tomorrow . While . the full text of The Casual Vacancy is a closely guarded secret, an . American journalist who has read it in the offices of publishers Little, . Brown has revealed some of the book’s more risque passages. Far from her usual wizard descriptions . of fantastical battles between good and evil, Miss Rowling’s new tale . is said to be one of class warfare, prostitution, heroin addiction and . teen sexuality. A female character is introduced with the description that the ‘leathery skin of her upper cleavage radiated little cracks that no longer vanished when decompressed’. At another point in the book, the reader meets a ‘lustful boy’ who sits on a school bus ‘with an ache in his heart and in his b****’. And the author’s usual fans may  also be shocked – if not a little perplexed – by the mention of one girl’s  ‘miraculously unguarded v*****’. The 47-year-old, who has three children, previously revealed that she was ready for a change in genre after years of writing magical tales. ‘I had a lot of real-world material in me, believe you me,’ she told the New Yorker magazine. ‘The thing about fantasy – there are certain things you just don’t do.  You don’t have sex near unicorns. It’s an ironclad rule. It’s tacky.’ However, she insisted her decision to write for adults was ‘not that I just wanted to write about... sex’. ‘I think there is a through-line,’ she added. ‘Mortality, morality, [they are] the two things I obsess about.’ The Casual Vacancy will appear on the shelves at booksellers tomorrow. The full interview with Miss Rowling will also be broadcast tomorrow on Radio 4's Front Row at 7.15pm.","Author also tells how her life as a single mother in the early-Nineties informed her latest book .

"It will go down in history as one of the most glamorous celebrity weddings of all time. But the honeymoon is over for Amal  Clooney who jetted out to Greece today to advise the country’s government on how best to persuade Britain to return the Elgin Marbles. Dressed in a simple white cardigan and khaki trousers, the new Mrs Clooney was spotted chatting happily to British Airways staff at the check-in gates at London's Heathrow airport. She later landed in Athens to a flurry of media attention. The 36-year-old, and her boss, Geoffrey Robertson QC, of London’s Doughty Street chambers, will hold a series of meetings with government officials during their stay, relating to the return of the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British Museum.

Center of attention: It comes two weeks after the 36-year-old married George Clooney in a lavish wedding in Venice, Italy, on September 27, which reportedly cost around £8million . It comes two weeks after Mrs Clooney married actor George Clooney in a lavish wedding in Venice, Italy, on September 27, which reportedly cost around £8million. Since the ceremony, the human rights laywer has changed her professional name to Amal Clooney - losing her maiden name - according to a listing on the website of Doughty Street chambers. It reads: 'Amal Clooney is a barrister specialising in international law, extradition and criminal law.' Mrs Clooney's choice of the Greece trip as her first official duty after her honeymoon was perhaps a wedding present to her husband who, earlier this year, waded into the centuries-old dispute over the Elgin Marbles, favouring the Greek side. The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, removed the Parthenon Marble sculptures from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803. The relics, known as the Elgin Marbles, are sculptures mostly by Phidias and his assistants. Visit to Greece: Perhaps her decision to make this her first official duty after her honeymoon was a wedding present to her movie star husband who, earlier this year, waded into the centuries-old dispute . Recently married: Fluent in French and Arabic, Lebanese-born Mrs Clooney is a barrister specialising in international law, human rights, extradition and criminal law . Statement: Mrs Clooney has represented clients in cases before the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as in domestic courts in the UK . In good spirits: Mrs Clooney is pictured smiling as she arrives at the Hotel Grande Bretagne in central Athens . In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon and his agents removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum. They were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting. They were bought by the British Government and are still on display in the British Museum. Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail. In February, while attending the Berlin Film Festival to promote The Monuments Men, Mr Clooney was asked by a Greek journalist whether Britain should allow Greece to reclaim its historic art. Smiling: Mrs Clooney's appearance comes following her lavish wedding, which reportedly cost about £8million . Sparking: She travelled with just her diamond eternity wedding band, but not her massive engagement ring . Happy: Mrs Clooney smiled as she arrived at the five-star hotel, which calls itself a 'historic landmark' in Athens . Press attention: The human rights lawyer attracted a lot of attention from the media as she landed in Athens . He replied: ‘You have a very good case. Maybe it wouldn’t be a bad thing if they were returned. That is a good idea, a fair thing to do.’ The Hollywood star’s involvement in the debate was not entirely welcomed. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘I suspect George Clooney doesn’t know the history of the Elgin Marbles and the legal entitlement Britain has to them.’ And a British Museum spokesman said at the time that trustees ‘feel there is a public benefit to having the sculptures in our collection remain part of our collection’. Greece says it is no longer an issue of ownership and that it would accept them back as a permanent loan, but the museum said the Greek government would first have to relinquish its claim to them.

Doughty Street chambers yesterday confirmed Mrs Clooney had travelled to Athens, where she will remain until Thursday, at the invitation of the Greek government ‘in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British museum’. A statement said: ‘Mr Robertson and Mrs Clooney were first asked to provide legal advice to the Greek government on this matter in 2011. Culture: Elgin Marbles at the British Museum.

They began arriving by chauffeur-driven taxi boats for the nuptials shortly before 6.30pm on the day, with Damon the first to arrive. Wave after wave of guests were ferried to the waterfront entrance of the exclusive hotel over a period of 20 mins, which culminated in Mr Clooney's arrival just before 7pm as the sun was setting. On the water: Mrs Clooney wed her Academy Award-winning beau last month in a romantic ceremony in Venice . Other celebrities in attendance included Emily Blunt, Vogue editor Anna Wintour, Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber, and John Krasinski. After the celebrations, it is understood the bride and groom jetted off to Marrakech for their honeymoon. Last weekend, it was reported that Mr and Mrs Clooney splashed out £10million on a sprawling Grade II-listed manor house in Berkshire. The Elgin Marbles are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants. The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce,  removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803. In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon. On display: The Elgin Marbles (pictured at the British Museum) are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were created by Phidias and his assistants . As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site. His agents subsequently removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum. Earl: The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce (pictured), removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire . The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around £70,000. The scupltures were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism. They were bought by the British Government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum. They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery. Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail. In February, while attending the Berlin Film Festival to promote The Monuments Men, George Clooney was asked by a Greek journalist whether Britain should allow Greece to reclaim its historic art. He replied: ‘You have a very good case. Maybe it wouldn’t be a bad thing if they were returned. That is a good idea, a fair thing to do.’ Amal Alamuddin Clooney's law firm Doughty Street chambers yesterday confirmed that she had travelled to Athens, where she will remain until Thursday, at the invitation of the Greek government. Her visit is ‘in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British museum’, it said. The authenticity of Elgin's permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal. However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognizable.","Amal Clooney, 36, arrives in Athens for talks on returning Elgin Marbles .

"Britain's biggest bank has been attacked by US authorities for 'turning a blind eye' to large-scale money laundering by drug cartels, terrorists and rogue regimes. The US Department of Justice yesterday accused HSBC of an 'astonishing record of dysfunction' in allowing hundreds of millions of illicit dollars through its branches. The bank is said to have had such a 'ringing endorsement' from Mexico drug gangs that it became known as the 'place to launder money'. Dirty money: HSBC's headquarters in Mexico City, where the bank is said to have become known as 'the place to go' for money laundering among Mexico's drug cartels . The revelations put renewed pressure . on trade minister Lord Green for his former role as boss of HSBC. The . Tory peer was chief executive of the bank from 2003 to 2006 – and US . authorities say the worst wrongdoing took place between 2002 and 2010. The blistering attack in the US was . launched as HSBC was forced to pay a record £1.2billion settlement for . money-laundering activities and breaching sanctions against regimes . including Cuba, Iran, Libya, Burma and Zimbabwe. In a further humiliation HSBC agreed . to spend £430million on a 26 point 'know your customer' plan to ensure . it doesn't do business with terrorists or drug gangs in future. HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver said the bank is 'profoundly sorry' for the failings. Yesterday, Lord Green, who left the . bank with a £19.1million pension pot, was urged by Labour's Chris Leslie . to clear up 'lingering' doubts about his failure to stop the scandal. Apologetic: HSBC chief executive officer Stuart Gulliver said the bank was 'profoundly sorry' for any part they may have played in money laundering . Dysfunctional bank: Lanny Breuer, Assistant Attorney General of the U.S. Department of Justice accused HSBC of 'turning a blind eye' and allowing billions of pounds to be laundered through their U.S arm . The shadow Treasury minister said Lord Green should reveal 'what he knew and when'. An email published in a probe by the . US Senate suggested Lord Green was warned about wrongdoing as far back . as January 2005 by the bank's former compliance chief, David Bagley. Lord Green, 64, has previously claimed 'he has no case to answer' but refused to comment yesterday. Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney . general of the US Department of Justice's criminal division said: 'HSBC . is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight – and . worse. The record of dysfunction that prevailed at HSBC for many years . was astonishing.' Mr Breuer said one transaction with Iran involved 32,000 ounces of gold that went directly to the Iranian Central Bank. Under fire: Trade Minister Lord Green previously claimed he had no 'case to answer' regarding money laundering taking place during his time as head of HSBC but emails suggest he was warned as early as 2005 . In a further damning detail, he . revealed that Mexican drug gangs used the bank so often they built . special boxes to fit into the HSBC teller's slots. He added that the bank was not being . stripped of its licence to trade in the US because it would mean . 'innocent' people in America would lose jobs. The Department of Justice said at . least £550million in proceeds from drugs trafficking from Mexican and . drug cartels was laundered through HSBC in the US. Cashwash: The posters on the right show how money has been laundered from Mexico through HSBC . It also accused the bank of helping . countries evade sanctions, with £410million from Sudan, Libya and others . sent to HSBC accounts in the US. Loretta Lynch, US Attorney for the . Eastern District of New York said that the 'woefully inadequate' compliance systems meant that HSBC became known as 'the place to launder . money'. The client list included Sinaloa, . Mexico's most powerful gang, which has been behind over 20,000 killings . since 2006. Murders by the cartel often involve beheadings. Some are . filmed and put on the internet to warn rivals. The extent of the scandal emerged in . July when senior HSBC executives were hauled before a powerful Senate . committee. The bank has been braced for a fine ever since, putting aside . £930million to cover a settlement. A UK Government spokesman said: 'At . the time of the report's publication HSBC expressed its regret that . there were failures of implementation and Lord Green has said that he . shares that regret.' HSBC said it increased spending on US anti-money laundering ninefold to £150 million between 2009 and 2011.","HSBC accused of ignoring money laundering by Mexican drug cartels .

"He is a man who has never cared about his face, or shown much regard for how he looks.

"This is the heartwarming moment a teenager with Down's syndrome is mobbed by his teammates after scoring the winning try during a school rugby match. Ethan Plumb, 15, had always wanted to be part of the rugby team at Ysgol Brynhyfryd school in Denbighshire, but was unable to play due to his condition not allowing him to take part in contact sports. However, after four years of sitting on the sidelines, Ethan from Llandyrnog, finally got his chance to play for his school against opponents Bala's Ysgol y Berwyn in the final minutes of a match after it was arranged by the team captain.

He then dives to the floor with the ball scoring the winning try in the match played at Denbighshire Rugby Club . And in the dying seconds, Ethan scored the winning try prompting him to be mobbed by his teammates as they crowd around to celebrate with him. A video showing the heartwarming moment filmed at Denbighshire Rugby Club was then posted to Youtube and has now gone viral after being shared thousands of times. The video starts by claiming to show 'just a normal school game' and 'just a normal try' before Ethan is seen catching the ball.

'It was a magical moment for Ethan, his family and all the staff who came to support him and the team. 'A special mention must go to Ethan’s teammates who looked after him, encouraged him, and even made efforts to help him with his maths by asking him to assist with the numbers on the back of the shirts before the game. 'I don’t think I’ve ever been prouder of being a teacher at Ysgol Brynhyfryd than I was last night. 'We have some truly special students at our school.' The video then ends with the team's captain, Dyfan Humphreys adding: 'I thought it was a great chance to do something that would hopefully mean a lot to him. Everyone that was there could tell it was a special moment. On the video uploaded to Youtube, an email sent by head of year Huw Griffiths announces that Ethan has scored . Mr Griffiths then goes on to praise the team and said he had never been prouder of the school . 'He’s a good lad and he deserved his moment.' The video has now caught the attention of the rugby world with former Wales captain Ryan Jones tweeting: 'Absolutely magical - well done everyone at #YsgolBrynhyfryd. WELL DONE ETHAN #mustwatch' Mr Tomos-Griffiths explained: 'It’s been seen in places including Mexico, Australia, Transylvania, Ireland and Taiwan,” he said. 'We had a novelist from South Africa get in touch who had just written a book about a boy who plays rugby. 'After seeing the video, he decided to dedicate his book to Ethan and to the school, and it’s now gone to the printer. 'Ethan deserves it. He had been asking Dyfan, the captain of the rugby team, if he could be in the team. 'It was unbelievable. Lots of the staff and his family were there, and the reaction of the pupils showed how much it meant to them. A video showing Ethan's heartwarming moment filmed at Denbighshire Rugby Club was then posted to Youtube and has been viewed thousands of times . 'Everyone at the school thinks a lot of him. After the staff showed the video to their registration classes, Ethan’s been getting lots of pats on the back from other pupils. 'I’ve told him he’ll need an agent now, and I’ve asked if I can have the job!' While Gwyneth Day, head of PE at added: 'The best part of this whole experience for Ethan is that it evolved from an idea by one of the Year 11 boys, who wanted him to be part of the team. 'Playing in a competitive sporting environment allowed not only Ethan but his teammates and opponents to develop the core values of teamwork and respect while having fun, which reflects what education should be about. 'Thanks must also go to Ysgol Y Berwyn, who made this event possible.'","Ethan Plumb, 15, had always wanted to be part of his school's rugby team .

"Doctors treating Formula One racing legend Michael Schumacher are continuing efforts to bring him out of his artificial coma despite reports to the contrary. Germany’s news magazine Focus stated that doctors had abandoned their attempts following 'complications'. But, responding to the article, Schumacher’s manager said that despite the process taking a long time, it was 'unchanged'. Scroll down for video . 'Misinterpretation': A report in the German media that doctors had abandoned attempts to bring Michael Schumacher (pictured with his wife Corinna) out of a coma has been denied by his manager . Denial: Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said the waking-up process remained 'unchanged' Sabine Kehm said: 'This phase can take a long time, which, much to our regret, can lead to many misinterpretations.'

The seven-time world champion is receiving round-the-clock care in intensive care in Grenoble University Hospital. Wife Corinna, 44, with whom he has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. Last week French investigators closed the official inquiry into his accident, ruling out any criminal wrongdoing. 'On hold': A German magazine claimed the slow waking-up process had been halted last week . Stricken: Seven-time F1 champion Schumacher with his wife Corinna in the Dolomites, Italy . The accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in an off-piste area. Schumacher lost control when he hit a rock and ended up smashing his head into a bolder 34 feet further down the mountain. His family issued a statement earlier this month saying that they 'strongly believe' he will recover. The . family said the most important element of his recovery was not the . speed but that it progressed in a 'continuous and controlled way'. The update came in the wake of reports that Schumacher had contracted pneumonia. Concerned: Corinna Schumacher arrives at Grenoble University Hospital Centre where her husband is being treated . Hope: Felipe Massa has claimed he saw Schumacher's mouth move as he spoke to him . The . statement said: 'Michael's family would like to again express their . sincere thanks for the continuous sympathy coming from all over the . world. 'The good wishes they receive help the family and we are convinced . they also help Michael, who still is in a waking up process. 'As . often in such situation, no day is like the next.

Manchester City players have had bedrooms at their new training complex fitted with sleep-inducing wallpaper . As well as the rest-aiding designs, £150,000 has been spent on special mattresses and luxurious pillows. The new 80-bedroom base, which sits alongside the football club's stadium, also features pool tables, arcade games and a social area.

"He may be one of the world's most composed men - but many have wondered whether his ice cool exterior extends to the golf course. Now, thanks to three of his playing partners, Barack Obama's golf game and his behavior while playing the frustrating sport can finally be revealed. And those hoping for a sign of human weakness - such as a club-throwing temper tantrum after pulling a shot left or leaving a putt short - will be sorely disappointed. Scroll down for video . Lefty: The left-handed president has spent roughly 1,000 hours playing 214 rounds of golf since he was elected to office in 2008 . According to the unnamed fairway companions, the president is an 'honest' stickler for the rules, who never gives up and even makes fun of himself when he hits a duff shot. One partner, speaking to the The New York Times, said: 'If you came down from Mars and saw his disposition on the golf course, you would think he would be a pretty good president. 'He's honest, he keeps his composure through terrible adversity, he's unruffled, he smiles, and he doesn't quit.' Unlike previous head of state Bill Clinton, who was not above claiming presidential pardons for lost balls, Mr Obama scores every shot he takes, one of his playing partners says. Hard at work: Barack Obama, pictured on a putting green outside the White House with Vice President Joe Biden in 2009 . All smiles: The president is said to be as composed on the golf course as he is in politics. One playing partner said Obama makes fun of himself when he hits a bad shot . The president's love of the sport is well-documented - it is estimated he has spent roughly 1,000 hours playing 214 rounds since he was elected in 2008. But his aptitude for the game has remained something of a secret. Unlike Clinton, who released his scores to the press, Obama's trailing media circus is kept out of sight when he's on the tee. Another playing partner who spoke to the New York Times suggested Obama's game has come on leaps and bounds - as a few years ago 'he didn't have a picture-perfect swing'. This was backed up by former NBA legend Michael Jordan, a single-figure handicap golfer, who described the president as a 'hack' player - declining to include him in his dream four-ball match. Presidential sport: Obama plays with former head of state Bill Clinton (L) and watches his shot during a round of golf at the Mid Pacific Country Club in Kailua, Hawaii (R) And short video clips posted online by people who happened to catch him on a course earlier in his presidency revealed he had bad posture when he stood over the ball. He also often made the age old mistake of failing to keep his head down during his swing, golf pros said. But his dedicated practice while in office seems to have paid dividend though - as it is rumored Obama's scorecard is now regularly hitting the mid-80s. In an interview last August, he described how he had come agonizingly close to (a 15ft putt) 'breaking 80' - a proud achievement for any  amateur golfer. Improvement: The president's dedicated practice while in office seems to have paid dividend as it is rumored his scorecard is now regularly hitting the mid-80s . The president embraces former NBA player Alonzo Mourning as he arrives to play golf at Grande Oaks Golf Club in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 2013 . A third playing partner described the president as a picture of composure on the golf course. He said: 'He makes a bad shot, and he makes fun of himself. You make a bad shot, and he makes a joke with you. He just seems happy to be out there, so the poor play doesn't bother him.' Hawaii has been one of Obama's favorite golfing getaways since being elected - he recently made a sixth visit to the islands since becoming president. Influential friends: Obama is pictured driving a golf buggy at Hawaii's Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course with Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key in the passenger seat . There, his playing partners are a collection of childhood friends, White House officials and the occasional world leader. This year he spent an afternoon at the Kaneohe Bay course with the Malaysian Prime Minister, reports CNN.

"A mysterious illness doctors are comparing to polio has struck down up to 25 children in California over the past year, leaving them with paralyzed limbs and a bad prognosis. The children, aged between two and 16, all suffered paralysis of the arms or legs and some experienced respiratory difficulties. 'What's . we're seeing now is bad. The best case scenario is complete loss of one . limb, the worst is all four limbs, with respiratory insufficiency as . well. It's like the old polio,' Keith Van Haren, a pediatric neurologist . at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital in Palo Alto, California, told USA Today. While the symptoms appear like polio, tests reveal that none of the children have the disease that plagued 20,000 Americans a year before a vaccine was created in 1955. Only three countries in the world still have polio: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. Scroll down for video . First known sufferer: Sofia Jarvis, four, contracted the illness as a two-year-old and still has a paralyzed left arm . One answer for the small outbreak could be a rare virus in the same family as polio. While studying five of the sick children to present at a medical conference, neurologists discovered that two of them tested positive for enterovirus 68, a rare virus that can cause polio-like symptoms. Before the development of a vaccine in 1955, some 20,000 American children were infected with the illness every year. The virus mostly affected children under the age of three, which is why it was also called infantile paralysis. Polio is spread from person to person, mainly through ingesting contaminated food or water. Most who become infected with the virus are asymptomatic, meaning they don't even get sick. But one to five in 1000 cases can experience paralyzation. Most paralyzation cases are caused by spinal polio which leads to paralysis in the legs. Unfortunately for those who caught spinal polio before the immunization, there was no cure and paralysis was permanent. Polio has since been eradicated in U.S. and most of the world. Only three countries have had polio uninterrupted: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. Other countries have experienced outbreaks of polio after eradication. The recent turmoil in Syria has led to cases being reported there, as well as in Somalia and Kenya. In the U.S., children receive four doses of the inactive polio vaccine (IPV) to guard against the illness. The other three children either weren't tested or weren't tested soon enough to have yielded results. There are more than 100 types of enterovirus that infect 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. each year. While enterovirus can sometimes cause serious symptoms, most people who catch the virus don't get sick or only see mild symptoms. This specific brand of enterovirus was first discovered in California in 1962 when four children got sick with the respiratory illness. Since 2000, the CDC has recorded just 47 cases. But enterovirus 68 doesn't account for all the cases. Pre-schooler Sofia Jarvis tested negative for the virus, and she was one of the first-known cases in the outbreak. In 2012, then two-year-old Sofia was admitted to hospital with breathing problems. Her mother, Jessica Tomei, 37, told MailOnline that her daughter Sofia began wheezing and vomiting and was rushed to hospital. She spent four days in hospital after being diagnosed with asthma and was discharged. Tomei knew something else was wrong. The . toddler had full use of her left arm when she left the hospital but 24 . hours later at a follow-up appointment, Tomei noticed the girl wasn't . moving her left arm. She was taken for an MRI scan but neurologists couldn't work out what caused her paralysis. 'I . will never forget his face, when he came out to tell me the findings of . the MRI,' Tomei says of the radiologist who read Sofia's MRI scan. 'He actually took her images to a pediatric neuroradiology conference to gather more opinions.' Mysterious afflication: The polio-like illness has affected up to 25 children in California . Sofia has undergone intense physical and occupational therapy to restore function to her arm, but nothing helped. She had surgery nerve transplant in April 2013 but Tomei says the family may have to wait a further two-and-a-half years before they know if it was effective. Right now, Sofia's arm is completely flaccid and her muscles are shriveled from lack of use. 'Sofia was completely healthy one day and paralyzed the next week,' says Tomei. She can't think of anything that could have caused her daughter's sudden serious illness, except a virus that went around her sons' school. Now . four, Sofia improved little after her illness and now has a paralyzed . left arm, weakness in her left leg and some breathing problems. Otherwise, she is a happy, healthy pre-schooler, and Tomei is grateful the mystery illness wasn't worse. 'We know we are lucky that the virus did not affect other areas of her spine as that may have caused paralysis of her legs or worse, all four limbs,' she says. 'As . we were leaving the doctor's office, I noticed that she went to grab . something with her left arm and she stopped, midway,' Tomei told USA . Today. Van Haren and other California neurologists searched recent medical files and found that there were more cases. Mid-century disease: Iron lungs in the Hynes Memorial Hospital in Boston during the Polio epidemic sweeping Massachusetts in 1955 . The California Department of Public Health's neurological surveillance team began to investigate the mystery illness. Dr Carol Glaser, leader of the team investigating the illnesses, called a doctor's request for polio testing for a young patient 'concerning' because polio has been eradicated in the U.S. and the child had not traveled overseas. The symptoms sometimes occur after a mild respiratory illness. Glaser said a virus that is usually associated with respiratory illness but which has also been linked to polio-like illnesses was detected in two of the patients. Van Haren will present five cases of the disease at the American Academy of Neurology's upcoming annual meeting in Philadelphia. All five experienced paralysis of the limbs that became most severe within two days. None had recovered any limb function after six months. 'We don't have a final case count, but it's probably in the neighborhood of 25 cases, all in California,' Van Haren told USA Today.","An unknown illness has affected up to 25 children in California .

"Makeshift camps including a library and pharmacies have been set up by Wall Street protesters in a clear sign that they intend to carry out their promise of staying into the winter. The development came after thousands of people yesterday marched to New York Police Department (NYPD) headquarters following accusations of brutality from officers dealing with demonstrators. Similar protests against the banking system have spread across the country, with events taking place up in Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago.

New York City police are braced for a . weekend of unrest in the Financial District, with the Occupy Wall Street . protest showing little sign of dissipating as it moves into its third . straight week. People have travelled from all over the country to voice their anger at the 2008 bank bailouts, rising numbers of foreclosures and persistently high unemployment. Protesters signalled their intention . to keep a presence in Zuccotti Park, just outside Wall Street, by . setting up larger camps of mattresses and sleeping bags, and laying out a . basic library, newspaper stands, pharmacies and I.T. hubs. Yesterday, the Occupy Wall Street protesters marched several blocks north to the NYPD headquarters . and demonstrated there for about two hours. Critics have accused officers of being . heavy-handed, saying they have roughed up people who did nothing wrong. The NYPD has disputed that claim. Protesters also say they're upset . about reports from The Associated Press that an NYPD intelligence unit . has sought to infiltrate the city's Muslim community. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg addressed the demonstrations on the WOR 710 radio show on Friday and sought to undermine the focus of their ire. He: 'The protesters are protesting against people who make $40,000 to $50,000 a year who are struggling to make ends meet. That’s the bottom line.' When asked how the NYPD would handle protests, Mayor Bloomberg said that while people have the right to protest, others also have the right 'to walk down the street unmolested.'

Occupy Los Angeles protests which . have also been small in numbers, has called for a march today at 10am . from Pershing Square downtown to City Hall.

"Kentucky police say a man tortured his neighbor's dog to death by feeding it razor blades wrapped in Canadian bacon because it barked too much. Robert Hamme, 60, of Elizabethtown was arrested for animal torture on Sunday after admitting that he left the deadly treats in his neighbor Jim Stotts's yard for the family's dogs to eat, according to a police report. The Stotts had been forced to put their 14-year-old beagle mix Nibbles to sleep after finding a mysterious blockage in his intestines that put the dog 'in agony.' Medieval torture: 14-year-old beagle mix Nibbles was fed razor blades wrapped in Canadian bacon by a neighbor who believed he barked too much . 'Every time he tried to drink, he would throw up in the water bowl,' Stotts told WLKY. 'He'd lay down and look up at me and crawl towards me, you could tell he was in serious pain,' Stotts added. The family couldn't afford the operation that might have saved their dog's life, so the beloved pet was put down to end his suffering. On the day of Nibbles's death, Stotts found his other dog, Bolt, chewing on a piece of Canadian bacon in his yard. Stotts discovered 'broken pieces of razor blade stuffed in the straight side' to conceal the deadly objects. He found two other pieces of Canadian bacon in his yard containing razor blades and small nails, and believes a fourth piece was responsible for Nibbles's death. Grieving: Jim Stotts says that his family's beagle mix Nibbles was living 'in agony' and for days the family did not know why . Elizabethtown police had gone to warn Hamme about meat in his own yard when he admitted to leaving the bacon-wrapped blades for Stotts's pets, according to The News-Enterprise. Stotts claimed that Hamme often complained about dogs in the neighborhood barking, but he believes there was no justification for killing his dog and calls what Hamme did 'an evil act.' Hamme was charged with two counts of animal torture, one of which is a felony that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.","Robert Hamme concealed broken razor blades in pieces of Canadian bacon and left them for the Stotts family's dogs .

"Peshmerga-chic? In videos and photographs to publicise its latest line, H&M stylists modelled the £14.99 jumpsuit with military boots and a high-waist belt . H&M has been forced into a grovelling apology after being accused of modelling a new khaki jumpsuit on the uniforms worn by female Kurdish soldiers battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Dozens of Kurds took to social media today to vent their outrage at the perceived gaffe after the Swedish fashion retailer released its Autumn/Winter collection earlier this month, including the olive-green all-in-one. In videos and photographs to publicise the line, H&M stylists modelled the £14.99 jumpsuit - one of the collection's standout pieces - with military boots and a high-waist belt. And today it was claimed the ensemble bears a striking resemblance to the loose-fitting fatigues worn by female fighters of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), who have been fighting alongside the Kurdish Peshmerga to repel the Isis onslaught. 'Disgraceful to say the least,' Arwin Banirad wrote on Facebook. 'At times like these, they choose to capitalise from the brave kurdish fighters in Kurdistan. They should be ashamed of themselves!' Ali Najat Barzinjy added: 'Wtf this is our traditional uniform it is not for every one.' Candace Ernst: said: 'H&M why don't you show some f***ng respect an fight with them in your stupid clothes.' Another social media user, Rawan Barwari, even suggested that H&M should consider giving some of the proceeds from the jumpsuit sales to the Kurdish fighters and their families. And today H&M apologised, claiming any similarities between its new range and the Kurdish uniforms are merely coincidental. 'We are truly sorry if we have offended anyone with this piece, this was of course never our intention,' said Ida Ståhlnacke, H&M's global press officer, in a statement. 'At H&M we want to offer the latest within fashion and trends and we continuously listen to our customers requests. 'The last seasons we have seen an increasing demand on jumpsuits and therefore we currently offer a selection of jumpsuits in different colors and materials, such as denim blue and deep red. 'The jumpsuit in question is made in a light and comfortable material and is a part of a larger collection consisting of many garments in khaki green, which also is one of the trendiest colors this season. 'The opinions of our customers are very important to us and we will keep this feedback in mind for future collections.' The so-called 'Peshmerga look' has been a hot topic on social media, with many Kurds agreeing that the jumpsuit looks more like the uniform of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), rather than that of the renowned Kurdish armed group, the Peshmerga. Consisting of both male and female soldiers, the YPG is the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). It is one of several Kurdish armed groups which are currently fighting Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria. The YPG has been fighting hard to defend the strategic town of Kobani near the Syrian-Turkish border. Similarity? Many Kurdish social media users claimed the outfit bears a striking resemblance to the loose fitting fatigues worn by female Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State . Women fighters for the Kurdish PKK militia are protecting the area around Lalish mountain, where a Yazidi city is home to the most important shrine of the Yazidi faith. Some have suggested H&M should donate some of the proceeds of the jumpsuit to their cause . Since IS militants started their offensive on Kobani two weeks ago, thousands of civilians have fled the Syrian town and have been trying to escape over the Turkish border. Many Kurdish men and women have also joined the Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported yesterday that a female YPG soldier carried out a suicide bombing mission, killing a number of Islamic State fighters. The fighter allegedly used a grenade to blow herself up near an important Islamic State position in the eastern part of Kobani. The woman has been named as Arin Mirkan, a commander in the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG). She is thought to be the first female suicide bomb attack against Islamic State. The YPG have since released a statement, confirming Mirkan's death: 'Of our martyrs was valiant comrade Arin. She was able to perform a fedai [sacrifice] action and kill dozens of ISIS mercenaries and stop their advance. 'Such strong will and determination shown by comrade Arin will be the spirit of resistance in the hearts of all of our combatants of the People's Defense Units and Women's Defense Units. If needed, all of our fighters will be comrade Arin and shall not allow the mercenaries reach their wishes at whatever cost.'","The £14.99 jumpsuit is part of H&M's Autumn/Winter women's collection .

"A hedge fund ‘superstar’ is converting a £3million mews house into a new gym and garage - for his neighbouring home. Chris Rokos, who is said to have a £200million fortune, bought the 19th century building in South Kensington, London, three years ago but started work on the property in 2013. The 44-year-old now wants to replace the former coach house with a fitness suite and ‘cardio area’ as part of a basement gym with a garage large enough for two large vehicles at road level. Star hedge fund manager Chris Rokos is converting a £3million mews house (pictured behind scaffolding) – so he can build a new garage and gym for his neighbouring home . The development will be completed accommodation for visitors and staff first floor for staff working at his home, which backs on to the site. According to plans lodged with Kensington and Chelsea council, the two buildings will be linked with a basement corridor. His home is a three-storey, five-bedroom flat in a large town house. The Standard reports that Mr Rokos paid £5.175million for one flat in the building six years ago and £2.475million for another shortly after and converted them into a single home. The plans were given the green light by planning inspector Neil Pope last summer following an appeal after the initial proposals were turned down by the council. The gym area will be linked with a basement corridor to his three-storey flat within a large town house (pictured behind the scaffolding to the right) The 44-year-old now wants to replace the former coach house (pictured) with a fitness suite and ‘cardio area’ as part of a basement gym with space for two large vehicles at road level . But the proposals have run into opposition from some locals and the Standard quotes one neighbour as saying: ‘You don’t really expect that kind of development on a small mews street.’ Another local is reported as saying: ‘He has made himself rather unpopular here as he is only going to use it as a back entrance, but we’ve had all this disruption.’ But a spokesman for Mr Rokos tonight told MailOnline that the building was being 'meticulously' restored and residents would not notice a difference from the exterior once the project is complete. The spokesman said: 'It is being meticulously restored with an unchanged façade. Nobody from the outside is going to notice any difference whatsoever apart from that the metal doors will be replaced by wooden doors.' Reuters reports that ‘star trader’ Mr Rokos made about $4billion between 2004 and 2012 for the hedge fund Brevan Howard which accounted for about 17 per cent of the firm’s profits during thatv time. The Standard reports that Mr Rokos was unavailable for comment.","Chris Rokos bought home in 2011 and started work on it two years ago .

"The lover and gardener of British expatriate Patricia Wilson, who was reported missing from her French home last month, has allegedly confessed to killing her and hiding her body in a thicket close to a pond. Jean-Louis Cayrou was charged with Miss Wilson’s murder and remanded in custody shortly after she vanished. He has repeatedly denied any involvement in the 58-year old’s disappearance, remaining ‘walled in silence’, according to a police source. Clue: Blood from Patricia Wilson, right, was found in a car belonging to Jean-Louis Cayrou, pictured left in 1990 . But a fellow inmate of Cayrou, 50, phoned prosecutors from inside the prison in which they were both being held – claiming that he had admitted his guilt to him. He told them: ‘Cayrou said they’d had a fight. He hit her and then realised she was dead. He panicked and hid the body in a thicket close to a pond.’ Police took the claim seriously as the inmate had risked imminent freedom by getting in touch. He had called on an illicit mobile on the eve of his release from a long sentence. After the call, officers began an intensive search close to the £250,000 stone cottage north of Toulouse that was renovated by former advertising executive Miss Wilson and her partner Donald Marcus on their arrival five years ago. Mr Marcus, 54, returned to the UK about a year ago for medical treatment – apparently disillusioned with life in rural France. Police say Cayrou and Miss Wilson began a relationship in April but split in July. Curious neighbours of Miss Wilson in the Aveyron village of Vabre-Tizac were told that the new search was simply part of the ongoing investigation, which had been scaled down to a handful of officers aided by forensic specialists. After the inmate’s revelations, Cayrou was secretly taken back to the cottage, along with the trial judge, so that clothing and other items could be removed from the scene in his presence. French police comb woodland near Wilson's cottage. Unless Cayrou leads them to its location, Miss Wilson's body may never be found . However, police are now privately admitting that unless Cayrou, their only suspect, confesses and leads them to the spot, Miss Wilson’s body may never be found. A police source said: ‘We are searching for a needle in a haystack in a vast rural territory – woods, dense forests plunging to the gorges of the Viaur, dozens of lakes, ponds, even abandoned houses, all perfect for hiding a body. The only person who can lead us to her is her killer.’ All evidence appears to point to the tall, semi-itinerant odd-job man and gardener as the killer. Even his lawyer, Sylvie Bros, agrees that police do not seem to be looking at any other leads. Police say friends told them that the relationship between Cayrou and Miss Wilson was tumultuous and stormy, with many arguments and fights. Shortly after they got together, she allowed him to move in with her from the caravan he inhabited several miles away. But she threw him out six weeks later and, according to friends and police, he began a campaign of harassment. On one occasion, it is alleged, he broke into her cottage to prove she wasn’t safe alone. Yet other expats in the 500-strong village, and friends and family of the shy, quietly reclusive Cayrou, do not believe he is a killer. A relative said: ‘We’re a large, extended family and, unlike most French, don’t have constant contact. Jean-Louis was always a bit of a hippy. We know little of his life but we do know he was gentle and kind – and never cruel. We thought of him as a good man.’ Patricia Wilson's home in the hamlet of Les Landes Basses, between Toulouse and Montpellier, in France . Other expats who employed him as an odd-job man also spoke of his kindness and quiet ability. But police believe that he attacked Miss Wilson on the steps of her cottage and dragged her down to his car. Blood and DNA in his Renault saloon matched Miss Wilson’s – and forensic officers found her DNA on other items inside the car. Traces on his mobile phone also put Cayrou close to the house at the time she is said to have disappeared. Prosecutors say Cayrou will not face a court before next year at the earliest.","Jean-Louis Cayrou was charged with Patricia Wilson's murder .

"Theresa May could be given powers to sack Police and Crime Commissioners under new laws following a series of scandals . Failing crime tsars could be sacked by the Home Secretary under radical plans to rescue the Conservatives’ tarnished law and order policy. Police and Crime Commissioners can currently only be removed at the ballot box every four years, but a series of scandals has prompted a rethink. Theresa May joined the chorus of calls for South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright to stand down last week after he was implicated in Rotherham’s failure to tackle the sex abuse of thousands of young girls. Kent PCC Ann Barnes also faced calls to quit after a documentary showed her struggling to explain her role and embarrassing her chief constable. And last week Bedfordshire’s Olly Martins was suspended by Labour while he faces possible criminal charges over leaking sensitive information about a death to his partner. Now a senior group of elected crime tsars is drawing up ideas to improve their own accountability between elections. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that among the options are: . The proposals, to be submitted to the Home Office by the end of the year, will prove controversial as they would dilute the independence of the role. But sources said reform was needed as the PCC ‘brand’, which got off to a bad start when only 15 per cent of voters turned out in the £75 million elections two years ago, was being damaged by recent scandals. One senior PCC said: ‘If somebody doesn’t resign, in extreme cases the Home Secretary should be able to recall the person and kick them out. The Home Secretary joined a chorus joined the chorus of calls for South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright (left) to stand down following Rotherham's child abuse scandal, while Ann Barnes also faced calls to quit after a documentary showed her struggling to explain her role and embarrassing her chief constable . ‘We are the ones who most keenly feel the concerns [in the wake of the South Yorkshire case].’ Liberal Democrats have joined Labour in indicating they would scrap PCCs completely at the next Election and return to a system similar to the old police authorities, where power is in the hands of a group of councillors rather than an individual. The Tories, however, may give PCCs more responsibilities. Next month the tsars will take control of victims’ services and it is hoped they will eventually run integrated ‘blue light’ services – police, fire and ambulance. Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘PCCs are elected. They are held to account by the most effective check on any politician – the ballot box.’","Police and Crime Commisioners can only be removed every four years .

"The BBC was under fire last night for treating hundreds of politicians, wealthy businessmen and its own staff to free tickets for Wimbledon. While ordinary members of the public have to spend hundreds of pounds or queue overnight to get in to the All England Club, the Corporation doled out 382 free passes. The beneficiaries included £2 million-a-year Premier League supremo Richard Scudamore – who shortly before this year’s tournament was embroiled in a row over sending sexist emails – and Christian Horner, the millionaire boss of Formula 1 team Red Bull.

The BBC has held the exclusive broadcasting rights to the tournament since 1927. As part of the deal, which is worth more than £20 million a year, the Corporation receives hundreds of Centre Court and Court One tickets . Senior BBC employees were given tickets, while junior staff were invited ‘as a reward for excellence at work’. But the broadcaster admitted guests were allowed to give away their tickets, raising the possibility they could have found their way into the hands of black-market touts. Last night, critics hit out at the BBC for the giveaways, revealed in unprecedented detail following a Freedom of Information request by The Mail on Sunday. Rob Wilson, Conservative MP for Reading East, said: ‘The BBC has once again been caught abusing the money of licence-fee payers. ‘Wimbledon tickets sprayed around to big companies who can afford their own is not what the BBC should be doing. Even if these tickets are part of a wider TV deal, it’s still a flagrant abuse.’ The BBC has held the exclusive broadcasting rights to the tournament since 1927. As part of the deal, which is worth more than £20 million a year, the Corporation receives hundreds of Centre Court and Court One tickets. In response to the FoI request, the BBC admitted: ‘Across the 13 days of Wimbledon 2014, the BBC allocated 235 tickets for business purposes and 147 tickets either to staff as a reward for excellence at work or to individuals (mostly BBC staff) for personal use in return for a donation to charity.’ Of these, 40 tickets were for the highly coveted men’s and ladies’ singles finals. Among those who enjoyed the finals thanks to the BBC were £255,000-a-year UK athletics chief executive Niels de Vos and his wife, Football League chairman Greg Clarke, Richard FitzGerald, chief executive of Racecourse Media Group, and American football’s UK chief Alistair Kirkwood. The beneficiaries included the millionaire boss of Formula 1 team Red Bull, Christian Horner (left) and £2 million-a-year Premier League supremo Richard Scudamore (right) Senior political figures were invited to other days of the tournament. Baroness Jones of Whitchurch went with fellow Labour peer Lord Collins, while Tory peer Patience Wheatcroft and Conservative MP Gareth Johnson also attended. As well as Mr Scudamore, two other Premier League employees were invited, along with three from the Football League, four from the Football Association, and two each from Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal, plus one from Chelsea. There were freebies too for Ian Holmes, Formula 1’s head of media rights, two members of the Mercedes F1 team, one from Williams, plus Mr Horner, the Red Bull team principal who is dating former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell. Extraordinarily, the BBC admitted: ‘It is possible that some of the people listed did not use the tickets themselves, but instead passed them on to colleagues or associates.’ A spokesman added: ‘As is standard practice, the BBC uses some of its complimentary tickets for business purposes – at no cost to the licence-fee payer. ‘They are given to partners with whom BBC Sport works, as an opportunity to discuss further business, and to demonstrate first-hand one of the biggest events BBC Sport delivers.’","BBC doled out 382 free passes to the Wimbledon Championships last year .

"Questioned: Muslim leader and Deputy PCC for Lancashire Ibrahim Master . A crime tsar’s deputy has been questioned by police over claims that he tried to halt a domestic violence investigation against a relative. Muslim leader Ibrahim Master is also facing allegations that he attempted to put pressure on the victim when she made a witness statement, to protect the family member accused of attacking her. Astonishingly, it is the third case in as many weeks exposed by The Mail on Sunday in which Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) or their deputies have been probed by the forces they were elected to hold to account. Bedfordshire’s deputy PCC Tafheen Sharif was forced to quit after she intervened in a murder plot trial to keep a cousin’s love life secret. And Kent PCC Ann Barnes was allegedly driving without business insurance when she crashed her car on her way to a meeting. Mr Master, the Deputy PCC for Lancashire, was quizzed at a police station and the Independent Police Complaints Commission is now looking into claims of harassment and perverting the course of justice. A former chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques and a Labour Party activist, Mr Master, 56, is credited with persuading local Muslims to help re-elect Jack Straw as the MP for Blackburn despite their opposition to the Iraq War. He hit the headlines as a community spokesman when it emerged that failed shoe-bomber Saajid Badat had attended an Islamic college in the former mill town. It was in his role as an ‘elder’ that he attended the scene of an alleged domestic assault where a 49-year-old relative was arrested. Mr Master was accused of trying to influence the police investigation by telling officers the matter would be dealt with ‘within the community’. Kent PCC Ann Barnes is being investigated for allegedly driving without business insurance after she crashed on her way to a work meeting . He is also alleged to have tried to influence the alleged assault victim’s witness statement that was given to police. Previous Mail on Sunday story published on September 21 . Mr Master attended a police station and was questioned on suspicion of harassment along with another man in August, and Lancashire Police then referred the matter to a local scrutiny board called the Police and Crime Panel. Yet neither Lancashire Constabulary nor the office of the PCC announced the extremely serious allegations against him. They have recorded the matter as ‘allegations of conduct in conflict with role’ and referred it to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The watchdog has the power to investigate crime tsars and their deputies and to pass files to the Crown Prosecution Service. Lancashire Constabulary said last night: ‘We can confirm that the Chief Constable has referred a complaint over the conduct of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner Ibrahim Master in relation to an ongoing police investigation to the Police and Crime Panel, and that the IPCC has been notified. Previous story from September 28 in relation to the misconduct of Deputy PCC for Bedforshire, Tafheen Sharif . ‘A 49-year-old man from Blackburn was arrested in August following a report of a domestic incident at an address. ‘He has been bailed pending further inquiries. The Deputy PCC for Bedforshire, Tafheen Sharif, had to quit after she tried to get her cousin anonymity when giving evidence about her love life in a murder plot trial . ‘During the course of the investigation, two other men, aged 56 and 58, from Blackburn voluntarily attended a police station and were spoken to about alleged harassment. 'They have not been arrested and inquiries are continuing into this aspect of the investigation.’ Mr Master has not been suspended and continues to work in the office of the Lancashire PCC Clive Grunshaw, who has himself been investigated by the IPCC over an alleged expenses fraud. Mr Grunshaw said: ‘I am aware that a complaint relating to the Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner has been made. As this matter is ongoing it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.’ Local councillor Peter Gibson, who sits on the Lancashire Police and Crime Panel, said he was ‘very surprised’ by the allegations. ‘I think there is certainly a case for a suspension while the investigation is going on. The PCC keeps going on about transparency but we don’t seem to have had much here.’ An IPCC spokesman said: ‘We have received a referral from Lancashire’s Police and Crime Panel that refers to the conduct of the Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Lancashire, Ibrahim Master. 'We are conducting an assessment to determine whether the matter is something that requires an investigation.’ Last night Mr Master vigorously denied the allegations. Speaking at his imposing £1 million home, he said: ‘I haven’t done anything wrong whatsoever and I strongly deny any misconduct.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ibrahim Master is a renowned Muslim community leade .

Right-wing elements in the security services also allegedly disliked his Jewish background. The smears surrounding Lord Brittan became so well known, Downing Street had to issue a warning that they were untrue. In June 1984, Private Eye revealed that gossip revolved around the Home Secretary. It wrote: ‘The “Cabinet Minister Scandal” that surfaced after a lobby briefing by Mr Bernard Ingham, Mrs Thatcher’s press secretary, relates to Home Secretary Leon Brittan.’ The magazine said the story –‘already widely discounted as false’ – had been revived after WPC Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead outside the Libyan embassy in 1984. Private Eye claimed ‘MI5 failed to evaluate the situation’ and that Brittan considered ‘a big shake-up in MI5’. ‘The MI5 spooks and loonies who object to having a Jewish Home Secretary retaliated by resurrecting the Brittan smear... spreading it round the Street of Shame,’ claimed Private Eye. Last week the MoS reported Lord Brittan was questioned by police over allegations he raped a 19-year-old student in 1967. He denies it and has not been arrested or charged. Lord Brittan’s spokesman said: ‘He is unaware of any of the briefings to which you refer.’ MI5 agents were said to have made the baseless claims against the then Home Secretary as he was angry they failed to prevent the disastrous Libyan embassy siege (pictured above at the time) Right-wing elements in the security services also allegedly disliked Leon Brittan's Jewish background .

"Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic has sparked outrage amid claims he shot dead a moose during a hunting trip. The controversial 33-year-old, who plays for Paris St Germain in France, was reportedly on a winter vacation in his homeland when he is alleged to have shot the animal. It has been reported that the  striker killed the 500kg moose with a single 'shot through its heart' during a hunting excursion while he was on a mid-season break from the French league. Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic (pictured) has sparked outrage amid claims he shot a moose through the heart during a hunting trip . The controversial 33-year-old, who plays for Paris St Germain in France, was reportedly on a winter vacation in his homeland when he is alleged to have shot the animal (file picture) According to the newspaper Expressen, the Sweden international was 'very happy' with his trophy. He has yet to make a statement about the claims, but it is understood that he is a hunting enthusiast. It is estimated that up to 100,000 moose are killed by hunters every year in Sweden. The former Barcelona and Inter Milan player appeared in a Volvo advert earlier this year in which he aims a gun at a moose. But the story has already sparked anger among animal rights activists. Camilla Björkbom from Sweden's Animal Rights' Union told Expressen: 'It is problematic. It is always problematic when famous people do things like that, because then it looks like they support this type of activities.' The Sweden international (pictured left and right) was reportedly 'very happy' with his trophy . The former Barcelona and Inter Milan player appeared in a Volvo advert earlier this year in which he aims a gun at a moose . Many hunting websites that offer guidance on shooting moose suggest aiming for the heart area to ensure the animal is killed quickly and does not endure unnecessary pain. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game says the 'objective of every conscientious hunter is to kill an animal as quickly as possible to avoid its suffering and to insure the highest quality meat. It says that the best area to aim for when hunting a large animal such as a moose is the 'heart-lung vital zone'. 'Any other shot has too great a chance to wound the animal,' the website adds. Ibrahimovic recently expressed his disbelief after being named second in a list of the 150 greatest Swedish sports stars - losing out to tennis great Bjorn Borg. Revealing his own version of Sweden's top five stars, he reportedly said: 'On the list I am first, second, third, fourth and fifth, with all due respect to others.'","Footballer reportedly shot a moose dead during a hunting trip in Sweden .

"Bosses at the FBI-style agency shut down last year for failing to catch ‘Mr Bigs’ have shared massive payoffs and bonuses. One senior executive at the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) chose to resign but was still rewarded with more than £200,000 – and has now walked into a well-paid job in another policing body. Meanwhile, the head of the discredited unit – accused of letting crime barons off the hook and failing to investigate a hacking scandal – was handed a £12,500 bonus. Bonuses: Michael Cornberg, pictured, received a payout from the defunct Serious Organised Crime Agency . Last night the Home Office was facing calls to explain why it had rubber-stamped the payments at a time when forces are having to cut bobbies on the beat to save money. Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘In a time of austerity it is unacceptable to use taxpayers’ money to reward those leaving an organisation that had been accused of under-performance and failure to achieve objectives. ‘We have made it clear a number of times that the public will not accept senior figures in policing who leave one job and obtain a huge amount of money, before going on to take up another publicly-funded job in the same area.’ Police Federation chairman Steve White said: ‘At a time of severe cuts which have put the entire service under strain and affected the pay of all police officers and staff, it seems farcical that huge sums of public money are used to pay off already well-paid executives.’ SOCA was set up in 2006 as a national force to tackle the growing threats of drug smuggling, human trafficking and fraud run by crime syndicates. Director General Trevor Pearce received a £12,500 bonus, it has been revealed . But a whistleblower told The Mail on Sunday it had decided it was ‘too difficult’ to catch its top targets. Then, it emerged that in 2008 the agency had a list of 102 organisations and individuals suspected of employing rogue private investigators to use illegal methods such as phone-hacking against rivals and customers – but failed to act. The ‘blue-chip hacking scandal’ led, last year, to the resignation of SOCA’s chairman Sir Ian Andrews, who failed to declare he had set up a private company with his wife, who also worked for a security firm. In October SOCA was taken over by the National Crime Agency, but the final set of accounts, published last week, show many of its top bosses were handsomely rewarded as the failed agency was abolished. Malcolm Cornberg, who earned £150,000 as its Executive Director Capability and Service Delivery, resigned last July but was given  a payoff worth £189,600 ‘which was agreed with and funded  by the Home Office’. He also received a payment in lieu of leave of £14,100. Last month he joined the College of Policing as Director of Corporate Services on a salary of £115,000. Two other SOCA directors, Gerry Liddell and Bradley Jones, received compensation payments of £184,500 and £82,400, respectively, and director-general Trevor Pearce got a £12,500 bonus. He was accused of treating Parliament with ‘absolute contempt’ by giving different accounts of when SOCA took action in the industrial espionage case. A spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘The settlement  with Malcolm Cornberg was reached in accordance with  Treasury rules.’","Bosses at FBI-style agency SOCA share massive payoffs and bonuses .

"British taxpayers face a legal bill of up to half a million pounds over a disastrous undercover Metropolitan Police investigation into corruption in the Caribbean. Senior Scotland Yard officers were sent to the Cayman Islands and their inquiry eventually resulted in the arrest of a judge and suspension of two local police chiefs. But there were no convictions, the judge and police chiefs sued successfully for damages and the Met team were nicknamed the ‘Sunshine Squad’ when pictures emerged of them relaxing on the beach during the failed two-year operation. Senior Scotland Yard officers were sent to the Cayman Islands (above) and their inquiry eventually resulted in the arrest of a judge and suspension of two local police chiefs, but there ended up being no convictions . Seven years on, the now-retired policeman who led the probe, Martin Bridger, is still being sued in England and the Caymans – and The Mail on Sunday can reveal that his legal costs of up to £448,000 will be picked up by the public after the Met agreed to keep paying them. Last night one insider said: ‘I’m astonished that the taxpayer is still paying for something like this after all these years.’ The debacle began back in September 2007 when the Foreign Office asked the Met to help investigate alleged corruption in the Cayman Islands, which is a British Overseas Territory. A team from the elite Directorate of Professional Standards, posing as estate agents, was sent on the 4,800-mile trip to look into claims that a deputy police commissioner was leaking sensitive information to a local newspaper editor. Detective Chief Inspector Bridger, who had been commander of Lambeth borough in South London, was Senior Investigating Officer. In March 2008, a Briton serving in the Cayman police, Stuart Kernohan, was suspended and later sacked. Six months later Judge Alexander Henderson was arrested by the Yard team and his office and computer were searched. Neither was ever charged with any offence, and British judge Sir Peter Cresswell ruled Judge Henderson’s arrest had been illegal. He was awarded $1 million damages. The now-retired policeman who led the probe, Martin Bridger, is still being sued in England and the Caymans – and his legal costs of up to £448,000 will be picked up by the public after the Met agreed to keep paying them . In May 2009, Mr Bridger and his 12-strong team returned home. In October that year an auditor found ‘significant deficiencies’ in the management and accounting of the police investigation, with the cost to the Caymans put at £8 million. Since then the case has descended into a blizzard of lawsuits involving Mr Bridger, Mr Kernohan and the Cayman authorities, with criminal complaints, misconduct claims and employment cases lodged. A spokesman for the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime said: ‘Payments have been made amounting to £180,000 and authorisation has been given in respect of further costs up to £268,000. This financial assistance reflects the Metropolitan Police’s support to an officer in respect of legal proceedings arising out of an overseas posting. ‘This latest sum is conditional upon Mr Bridger taking steps to bring these matters to a swift conclusion.’ Speaking about the saga earlier this year, Mr Bridger said: ‘I have done nothing wrong other than trying to expose the truth and to defend myself as best as I can.’ Ann Barnes spent £15,000 on the 'Anne Force 1' van . A crime tsar has vowed to ditch the ‘presidential’ minibus that helped turn her into a national laughing stock. Ann Barnes, Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent, spent £15,000 on a van that she decorated with the name ‘Ann Force 1’ – jokingly nicknamed after the US President’s personal jet Air Force One – as she toured the county meeting the public. But she has decided to get rid of the van after it appeared in a documentary on her role, which left her the target of criticism from local politicians and police officers. In an appearance before her local scrutiny board this week, Mrs Barnes said: ‘I will retire my van… sadly. The decision to retire it is a difficult one and I don’t know what I’m going to replace it with. But I do have to acknowledge that its reputation has been tarnished and I don’t want that to form the story and detract from the engagement with local people.’ However, she was surprised to discover that almost all members of the Kent Police and Crime Panel – who hold her to account – wanted her to keep it, saying it was a good way to let people know she was available to talk to. Mrs Barnes was elected in 2012, having previously claimed that the £85,000 role was a waste of money. She gained notoriety last year after The Mail on Sunday revealed she had employed a foul-mouthed teenager, Paris Brown, as her ‘youth commissioner’. The 17-year-old had to quit following controversy about offensive comments on Twitter.","Senior Scotland Yard officers were sent to Cayman Islands seven years ago .

"Chief Inspector Mick Williams was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and is currently on police bail . A top officer from a scandal-hit force has been suspended after his teenage son was jailed for sexually abusing underage girls. Chief Inspector Mick Williams has been taken off duty by Cleveland Police following his arrest on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. He and his wife were arrested late last year, but the news only emerged following their son’s sentencing on Friday. Darryl Williams, 19, wept in the dock at Newcastle Crown Court as he was sentenced to two years and nine months behind bars. The court heard the ‘predatory’ youth had exploited ‘young and impressionable females’. He pleaded guilty to six offences against five girls aged between 12 and 15, over three years. Judge John Milford told him: ‘You had a high sex drive and were persistent. I am satisfied that you are an ongoing risk to underage females and that risk needs to be managed.’ A Police spokesman last night confirmed his father’s arrest, saying: ‘He is currently suspended and the file is with the CPS awaiting their decision.’ Cleveland Police has been at the centre of a lengthy corruption probe in recent years. Sean Price became the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years after he was found guilty of misconduct. Last month he was told he would not face charges at the end of a £4 million inquiry.

"Scathing: Commissioner Bob Jones claims PCCs have been a £100m waste of money . Elected crime tsars have been a £100million waste of money and spend their time dreaming up gimmicks and clashing with chief constables, one of them admits today. Bob Jones has confessed that in their first year in charge of police forces, Police and Crime Commissioners have neither made them run better nor made the public safer. The Labour PCC for the West  Midlands said their planning was vague and that many of this new breed of politicians, who earn up to £100,000, had remained generally unknown rather than building public confidence. In a withering assessment published to coincide with the first anniversary of the PCCs’ election, Mr Jones gave the flagship law and order reform ‘four out of ten’ overall and condemned it as ‘£100 million spent so far on making police accountability less effective’. His comments provoked anger from Policing Minister Damian Green, who said: ‘Across the country, Police and Crime Commissioners are driving reform and holding their forces to account. And it’s the public who’ll decide how well they’ve  performed - at the ballot box.’ In his ‘school report’, Mr Jones gave PCCs three out of ten for cutting crime, claiming the rate is now, at best, flat, and at worst rising again after years of decline. The lowest grade, two out of ten, came in the category of public confidence. ‘With record low turnout at the election, record levels of hostile publicity, record numbers of investigations into PCCs and clashes between chief constables and PCCs etc, there is not much evidence PCCs have led to more confidence in policing or the governance of policing,’ said Mr Jones. Bad choice: Kent PCC Ann Barnes, left, and then Youth Commissioner Paris Brown, right, who stepped down from the role after making offensive comments on Twitter . He gave scores of four out of ten for drawing up budgets and plans, writing: ‘PCCs have had to cope with Government funding reductions. However, some have not helped the situation by introducing gimmicks and there are serious questions about the sustainability of some budgets.’ PCCs were brought in across England and Wales last November by the Conservatives to set budgets and decide on strategies while also holding chief constables to account. But lack of enthusiasm for the reform among Liberal Democrats meant the polls were held with little publicity, and a record low 15 per cent of voters turned out. Anger: Policing Minister Damian Green said PCCs are 'driving reform' and 'holding their forces to account' Some keen to stand were barred by strict rules and the Tories managed to convince only very few ex-military chiefs and business leaders to stand. Since the election PCCs have become embroiled in a series of  scandals, including: .","Bob Jones says Police and Crime Commissioners are a waste of money .

PCCs in Gwent and Lincolnshire forced out their chief constables. In each force only one person applied to take over the top job.
At least a dozen PCCs handed out well-paid deputy roles to friends and allies without advertising them.
Four PCCs have already been investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for alleged criminal misconduct. Lancashire’s Clive Grunshaw is facing charges, while Durham’s Ron Hogg is still under investigation.
Several PCCs have caused controversy over expenses. Just this week it emerged that Norfolk’s Stephen Bett had declared his home as his place of work, allowing him to claim mileage for driving to the force HQ. He has agreed to repay £3,000."
"'Staggering hypocrisy': Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, pictured, has condemned zero-hour contracts . Labour's union paymasters faced accusations of hypocrisy last night after it was revealed that they use tutors employed on controversial ‘zero-hours’ contracts. Unite, Britain’s biggest trade union, has led a campaign against bosses who take on staff without guaranteeing how many hours they will work, or how much they will be paid. General secretary ‘Red’ Len McCluskey has claimed the ‘pernicious practice’ is blighting Britain and ‘the Government’s refusal to address the growing scandal is creating a growing sub-class of insecure and low-paid employment’. Labour leader Ed Miliband, whose party has received £12 million in donations from the Left-wing organisation since the Election, has also claimed that workers on zero-hours contracts are being exploited. But today it can be revealed that Unite’s own union reps are being taught by academics employed by further education colleges on zero-hours contracts. A leaked report presented to bosses admits the practice is going on, and could be ‘problematic’ given the union’s opposition to deals that are said to leave staff with little job security, no pension or holiday pay. Last night Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps criticised the  union over its ‘staggering  hypocrisy’. He said: ‘Len McCluskey spent the summer shamelessly grandstanding about zero-hours contracts, yet Unite reps are being trained in colleges using these contracts. ‘Rank-and-file union members will be appalled to discover their union not only teaches lessons in intimidation, but that Unite’s leadership preaches against the use of zero-hour contracts while using them.’ Tory party chairman Grant Shapps, pictured, criticised Mr McCluskey for spending the summer 'grandstanding' The unpublished report, Education Inquiry For Unite, presented to its executive council earlier this year, describes how the union has tried to cut costs on courses and states: ‘There were savings to be made when tutors who were only irregularly required were now on zero-hours contracts. ‘It was recognised that such changes had been challenging though, given trade union perspectives on zero-hours contracts more generally.’ Unite insisted it did not directly employ the tutors, who work for colleges and who give short courses to union reps in how to campaign more effectively. A spokesman said: ‘Unite is not a zero-hours employer. ‘That view will have been made clear to the colleges, but we cannot be answerable for their employment practices.’","Reps taught by zero-hours tutors, says report obtained by Mail on Sunday .

"Argument: Baroness Deech has said current divorce system is 'terribly unfair' and needs urgent reform because it sends a 'bad message' to women . Britain's divorce laws should be tougher on women because they are encouraged to shun work and 'find a footballer' to marry, a female peer has said. Baroness Deech, who is standing down as the chair of the Bar Standards Board, believes the divorce system is 'terribly unfair' and needs urgent reform. She says as the law stands young women are sent the 'bad message' to find someone rich and 'once you are married you need never go out to work'. 'Never mind about A levels or a degree or taking the Bar course — come out and find a footballer,' she told the Financial Times. She believes that couples should settle the terms of their divorce before their wedding and this would stop women marrying successful men and then running off with a large share of their wealth. The peer is currently backing a House of Lords bill that would make prenuptial and postnuptial agreements agreements legally binding. She said: 'We have a whole area of law which says once you are married you need never go out to work, [that] you are automatically entitled to everything you might need even if that marriage breaks down and it's your fault.' The system is in sharp contrast with calls for equality where women should get half the posts on FTSE 100 boards and the Supreme Court, she said. Last month the husband in Britain’s biggest ever divorce case should receive the lion’s share of the £870million fortune at stake because he did most to make their fortune, a judge ruled. Sir Chris Hohn, son of a Jamaican motor mechanic, will take more than half a billion pounds from the wreck of his marriage due to his extraordinary achievements as an ‘activist investor’. His City coups were worth billions and included a profit of more than £600million from the takeover that led to the collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland, as well as a £100million profit from last year’s botched privatisation of Royal Mail. Sir Chris’s wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn is likely to appeal against the decision by Mrs Justice Roberts to deny her an equal share of the couple’s vast wealth. Battle: Sir Chris Hohn, the husband in Britain’s biggest ever divorce case, will keep the lion’s share of the £870million fortune because a judge did more than his ex-wife Jamie to earn the money . Row: Baroness Deech believes that couples should settle terms of their divorce before their wedding to stop women marrying successful men and then running off with a large share of their wealth in High Court battles . Mrs Cooper-Hohn, who has been awarded £330million, raised their four children and ran the charitable foundations into which her husband poured most of the money made. The judge said, however, that he had also played a major role in managing the charities and that the couple would have no fortune to divide without him. Lady Deech has previously argued that changes to divorce laws would also better protect career women. She said on Radio 4’s Sunday Programme earlier this year: ‘Lots of young women these days are working, earning well, and would feel it extremely unfair if a young man who they marry and perhaps leaves them is going to take with him a sizeable chunk of what they have worked so hard for. ‘The position of women has changed in the last 40 years and it’s time to recognise that in this country, like virtually every country in the world, two people who are getting married ought to be able, if they want, to make a contract about how their assets are to be divided if they divorce.’","Baroness Deech says laws mean women are being send a 'bad message'

"Two people were arrested today after a suspected sham marriage was stopped moments before they were to be officially married. Home Office immigration enforcement officers raided the wedding just before a 21-year-old French woman planned to wed a Cameroonian man. Investigators attended the ceremony at Winchester Register Office in Hampshire following a tip-off that it might not be genuine. Two other people were later arrested at an address in the city. Arrests: Police and Home Office immigration officers arrested the man and woman moments before their suspected sham marriage ceremony in Winchester, Hampshire . Searches: The raid has led to searches of properties in London and Basingstoke over fears the marriage was not genuine . The woman was held on suspicion of perjury, bigamy and assisting unlawful immigration. It is suspected she had been married twice before, neither of which relationship had been dissolved. The 26-year-old Cameroonian man, whose leave to remain in the UK expires shortly, was detained on suspicion of perjury. Both were being questioned at a police station in Hampshire, while searches took place at properties in Basingstoke and Lewisham, south London. The Home Office said the operation took place with the full co-operation of the superintendent registrar. Stuart Reynolds, of the Home Office immigration enforcement criminal investigations team, said: 'We work closely with registrars across the south of England to stop abuse of the marriage system by those who wish to get round our immigration laws. Co-operation: Police said the Winchester Registry Office assisted in the arrests . 'Where there are suspicions that a relationship may not be genuine, we will investigate and, if necessary, intervene to stop it happening.' A spokesman said a sham marriage or civil partnership typically occurs when a non-European national marries someone from the European Economic Area as a means of attempting to gain long-term residency and the right to work and claim benefits in the UK. Commenting on the arrests in Winchester High Street he added: 'A 29-year-old man from the Ivory Coast and a 30-year-old man who presented a Belgium identity card were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law just after 11am. 'Officers also found a quantity of cash which has been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act.'

"Relief: Maryam Hassan leaves Southwark Crown Court today after being found not . guilty of assaulting actress Tara Reid and racially aggravated . harassment . A former model accused of glassing American Pie actress Tara Reid in the face wept hysterically as she was cleared today. Maryam Hassan, 27, allegedly assaulted the Hollywood star after spotting her chatting to former Holland international Edgar Davids at Beat members-only club. The West End haunt is popular with footballers and celebrities including teen heart-throb Justin Bieber. The American pin-up was rushed to hospital after suffering a corneal abrasion which required a consultation with a plastic surgeon following the 'ugly' incident, Southwark Crown Court heard. Ms Reid also received a cut to her forehead and an injury to the bridge of her nose. But Hassan - a friend of West Ham player Carlton Cole - was unanimously cleared of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. She was also acquitted of racially abusing a bouncer at the club. The jury of six women and six men reached its verdicts after four hours and four minutes of deliberation. Casually . dressed in a black blouse, tight black jeans and ballet pumps with a . cat motif, with her dark blonde hair scraped into a top knot, Hassan . sobbed hysterically as the verdicts were announced. She shouted 'thank you' at the jury before hugging a friend who had been seated in the public gallery. Hassan refused to comment outside court. Ms . Reid had enjoyed a birthday meal of lobster and champagne at swanky . restaurant and private members club, Annabel's, in Mayfair, prior to . arriving at Beat on November 8 last year. 'Attack': Maryam Hassan, pictured yesterday, left, was accused of glassing American Pie actress Tara Reid, right, at a London private members' club after throwing a drink over her . Innocent: Maryam Hassan, centre, was said to be drunk during the alleged incident. She is pictured today with defence barrister Mr Mozammel Hossain, right, leaving court . In . a statement read to the court, the Scrubs actress told how she 'I . noticed a female who kept approaching the table a few times. Not guilty: Maryam Hassan, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court, was also accused of racially abusing a bouncer but was cleared . 'I . didn't know who she was but I guess she was not getting any attention. She came up to me and threw the contents of her drink over my chest. 'I reacted immediately and threw my drink over her. The club's body guard took her away. 'The same female came back 20 minutes later and she was then taken away. 'She said ""I'm not getting kicked out, you whore, you slut"".' The actress told how she 'could not open my eyes' after the incident. Ms Reid claimed that Hassan 'went crazy, she went psycho like Naomi Campbell.' 'It was so quick, she stood close to me within arms' length, and smashed the glass in my face.' Giving . evidence Hassan, who graduated with a degree in political sciences from . the University of Sunderland, said the glass flew out of her hand as . she was manhandled by door staff. Hassan . admitted calling bouncer Zimzan Lelo a 'w******' but denied using . racist language, because she is of mixed race heritage and her husband . is black. In a character witness statement, England striker Carlton Cole said he was 'honoured to call her a friend'. Hassan . had struck up a friendship with the star 12 years ago after she worked . on charity projects for the Carlton Cole Foundation, which helps . underprivileged children in war-torn Sierra Leone. The footballer said Hassan 'had shown herself to be of consistent character with a good moral standing'.

"In life, Karen Lloyd enjoyed a coffee while shopping with friends. In fact, she liked it so much she was nicknamed ‘Costa Karen’. So after the fun-loving mother of two died from cancer at 51, her family thought it only fitting that her funeral should feature a shot of something frothy too. They commissioned a coffin in her favourite coffee shop Costa’s burgundy colour with the chain’s logo on the side. A coffee break from tradition: Karen Lloyd's friends and family opted . for a Costa coffee-themed coffin after she died from cancer . The words ‘one shot, extra hot skinny latte’ – her drink of choice – were also written on one end of the wooden coffin. Her husband Alan, 45, said yesterday: ‘The funeral was a celebration of her life and it’s good to do it on a humorous side. ‘When we asked the funeral directors for a Costa-themed coffin, they said, “We’ve never done one of those before”. Popular: 450 mourners attended the mother-of-two's funeral . 'But they managed to do one for us.’ It was made by Oxford firm Colourful Coffins and there were 450 mourners at the funeral in Swindon on Friday. Mrs Lloyd was diagnosed with breast cancer in June and died on February 4, leaving behind her husband and sons Harry, 19, and Eddie, 15. The coffin was carried into the church to the sound of 'More than a Woman' and, following the service, carried out to 'Viva Las Vegas'. Lynzi Barrett, a close friend of Karen, said: 'She wanted a coffin with a difference and Alan, her husband, wondered what could be done regarding Costa. 'I telephoned Mark Hillier of Hillier Funeral Service and within an hour he called me back to say we could have it. It brought a smile to our faces at a time of sorrow. 'Both the funeral and wake were based around her love of Costa coffee, shopping and sleeping. 'We had pictures of her everywhere as she lit up every room she entered. 'She was the most positive, kind person I have ever met, who loved her boys and most definitely made an impact on everyone she ever met.' Karen, who worked for a blinds and shutters company before her illness, had her funeral at Christ Church in Old Town, Swindon, Wiltshire, last week. She was diagnosed with breast cancer last June following a mammogram. She didn't have a lump - instead she had an enlarged breast. Despite her illness, she dedicated time to charity work, raising more than £2,000 for the Breast Cancer Unit at the Great Western Hospital. Through the months of chemotherapy and invasive treatment, Karen kept a brave face and rarely allowed herself to shed any tears. Latte will and testament: Mrs Lloyd's hearse arrives at the church for her funeral last week . But tragically, the cancer spread to her spinal fluid and brain and, in December, she was given the devastating news the condition was terminal. Karen passed away at Prospect Hospice on February 4, leaving behind her two sons Harry, 19, and Eddie, 15, and husband Alan. Reverend Captain Clive Deverell paid tribute to the fun-loving mum during Friday's service. He said: 'She loved being with her friends and families and she had great friends. 'She was a loving mum to her two sons Harry and Eddie. And of course there was Costa, shopping, Costa, shopping and I forgot to say, Costa and shopping. 'She really liked getting herself ready and was always immaculate. If they were going to go on holiday and wanted to arrive on time, Alan's trick was to set all the clocks in the house one hour early. 'Her humour and her fortitude were impressive. She is making the baristas in heaven's lives rather difficult with her one-shot extra hot skinny lattes.' More than 450 people went to her funeral, with 300 attending the wake. Real loyalty: Undertakers prepare to carry Karen's coffin into the church . Loving couple: Alan and Karen Lloyd pictured on holiday . Lynzi added: 'It looked more like a wedding than a wake, she would have loved it.' Karen Lloyd's husband said today her friends nicknamed her 'Costa Karen' - but he called her 'Costa Lot'. Alan, . who works on offshore wind farms, was 80 miles off the coast of Germany . when found out that his wife of 20 years was seriously ill. He said: 'She was first class, so friendly and happy, I couldn't have asked for a better wife. 'She was nicknamed Costa Karen, although I called her Costa Lot. It's a very sad loss, we were married for 20 years. I am going to miss her like anything. 'The funeral was a celebration of her life and it is good to do it on a humourous side. 'When we asked the funeral directors for a Costa Coffee-themed coffin, they said ""you what? We've never done one of those before"". But they managed to do one for us. 'We went to Las Vegas for her 50th birthday and on one of the days we hired cars and went to the Grand Canyon. 'She . said it was one of the best days of her life and we said we would go . back again one day. That's why she went out to Viva Las Vegas.' A Costa spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are of course with the family at this difficult time.

"Phillip Schofield and his employer ITV today agreed to pay Lord McAlpine £125,000 in damages after the television presenter showed a list of alleged paedophiles to David Cameron which contained his name. Tory peer Lord McAlpine was subjected to lurid online claims falsely linking him to sexual abuse at a north Wales care home which Schofield attempted to bring to the Prime Minister's attention live on This Morning earlier this month. However, he inadvertently allowed the list of names to be seen by viewers, prompting the latest settlement by Lord McAlpine's legal team who have already taken £185,000 from the BBC over the now infamous Newsnight broadcast which began the witch hunt against him. Scroll down for video . 'Misjudged camera angle': The extraordinary moment Phillip Schofield handed the list of names to David Cameron which prompted a huge financial settlement . McAlpine's lawyer Andrew Reid said the incident has 'embarrassed the Prime Minister and destroyed the reputation of my client'. In a statement, ITV said today: 'ITV and Phillip Schofield have now reached agreement with Lord McAlpine to settle his libel claim, made in relation to the This Morning programme broadcast on 8 November 2012. 'ITV and Phillip Schofield apologise unreservedly to Lord McAlpine, have agreed the terms of a statement to be made in open court, and have agreed to pay him damages of £125,000 and his legal costs.' ITV is the second name in a long list of organisations and individuals pursued by Lord McAlpine for wrongly linking him to a paedophile ring. Action is being considered against a 'very long list' of Twitter users who wrongly named the former Tory politician, thought to include comedian Alan Davies and the Commons Speaker's wife Sally Bercow. Battles: Many have apologised to the Tory peer but his legal team has said that people have destroyed his reputation . And it emerged yesterday that police are starting a 'scoping process' to look into whether any criminal offence has been committed. Lord McAlpine has asked those who linked him to child abuse allegations to apologise formally and pay a 'sensible and modest amount', which he plans to donate to BBC Children in Need. Lord McAlpine was mistakenly implicated by Newsnight's November 2 broadcast in a paedophile ring that targeted children at the care home in Wrexham. The peer said the damage of the Newsnight report 'can't be repaired' and he now has to live with the legacy of suspicion. After the broadcast, Newsnight carried a full, on-air apology for the broadcast a week later.An official report by the BBC's Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie into the botched investigation concluded that Newsnight staff had failed to complete 'basic journalistic checks'. BBC controversy: Lord McAlpine is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after BBC's Newsnight broadcast the wrong claims . Tweet: Sally Bercow was ordered to pay £15,000, which was donated to charity, after posted the above tweet . Mr MacQuarrie also found there was confusion about who had responsibility for 'final editorial sign-off', adding that the programme's editorial management structure had been 'seriously weakened' as a result of the editor having to step aside over the Jimmy Savile scandal, and the departure of the deputy editor. Disciplinary action is being pursued over the incident. Lord McAlpine has said the BBC could have saved 'a lot of agonising and money' by simply calling him before the programme went out. His solicitor Andrew Reid told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'We reached a settlement with ITV of £125,000 damages - not an insubstantial amount. My client is pleased with that amount of money. 'It is a pragmatic settlement. I think we accepted the legal argument that the Newsnight programme had effectively set the pot boiling at that point and the Schofield stunt added fuel to the fire that was already there, and we had to take that into account. It was listening to sensible legal argument.' Settlement: McAlpine's solicitor Andrew Reid said today the settlement with ITV was a pragmatic one but won't be the last . Mr Reid said he did not know what Lord McAlpine intended to do with the ITV money. The peer has said that he will donate money he receives from people who defamed him on Twitter and other online social media to Children in Need. The solicitor said he had already been contacted by a number of people who mentioned Lord McAlpine's name on Twitter in the wake of the Newsnight programme - including Sally Bercow, the wife of the Speaker of the House of Commons - and urged others to come forward. And he revealed that he has spoken to Scotland Yard about the possibility of a police investigation into people who 'maliciously' retweeted the peer's name.","ITV and presenter apologise unreservedly for incident on This Morning .

"A man and his wife have died after their plane crashed on the way back from France. Businessman Carl Whiteley and wife Kathryn are understood to have been killed when their light aircraft crashed off St Ouen's Bay, Jersey, today. The aircraft crashed five miles out to sea in thick fog while on approach to Jersey Airport at 10.20am. Jersey Police have yet to identify both occupants but in a statement released by Mr Whiteley's Derby-based firm, Belmont Regency Group, colleagues have paid tribute.

Brett Hannon Managing Director said . today that Mr Whiteley was piloting the Cessna Crusader aircraft when it . plummeted into the sea. He said: 'Belmont Regency group Ltd are dismayed to hear of the death of one of our founder directors, Carl Whiteley and his wife Kathryn Whiteley when the plane he was piloting crashed into the English Channel on a flight from northern France to Jersey this morning, Wednesday September 4. 2013, on his way back home. 'Our thoughts are with his family at this tragic time.

'The States of Jersey Police will now be working alongside the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) to establish what happened. 'We have yet to formally identify the people on board but believe them to be two UK residents. 'Family liaison officers from Jersey are supporting the family of those we believe to be involved. We ask that those families are given privacy.' The UK-based and American-registered Cessna plane was heading for Jersey airport from Dinan in France, an airport spokesman said. A Jersey airport spokesman said parts of the wreckage had been recovered this morning. Visibility was believed to have been poor around the Jersey coast this morning but it is unknown if this had anything to do with the tragedy. Police were called at 10.21am but no time has been given for when the aircraft lost radio contact. AAIB investigators are currently travelling to the island to begin their inquiry and a recovery operation is ongoing to reclaim the bodies, police said.

"Pleaded guilty: Dominic Di Chiera admitted seven counts of fraud after ordering thousands of pounds of electronics using BBC accounts . A bitter BBC technical operations engineer used the corporation’s account to order nearly £8,000 worth of electronics, which he placed in various offices to 'implicate' the manager who sacked him, a court heard. Former BBC News team leader Dominic Di Chiera, 50, of Battersea, south London admitted ordering a 3D Blu-ray player, LED televisions, a mobile phone, a camera drive and other electrical items as his contract neared its end. 'When ordering these items the defendant had the electrical goods delivered to his home address,' prosecutor Miss Amanda McCabe told Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court. 'He said he committed the offences on being told that his contract would not be renewed and wanted to implicate a BBC colleague responsible for budgeting, who was responsible for not renewing his contract. 'He intended that the purchases would implicate him and he took items to the BBC to deposit them, but some were found at his home address.' Di Chiera was upset with technology operations manager Huw Davies, who said when contacted: 'He was copped out. The police discovered that orders were going to a residential address.' Australian-born Di Chiera pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud by false representation, namely fraudulently using a BBC account to make purchase orders totalling £7,773.63p between June 4 and 26. He was employed at a variety of BBC sites and has also worked for Channel 4 and BSkyB. 'There is an element of breach of trust here and the items were of a high value,' added Miss McCabe. Find: Electronics were discovered at the former BBC worker's home in Battersea (pictured) The court heard Di Chiera was close to a nervous breakdown after hearing his employment was coming to an end and is keen to receive help to ensure he does not repeat this type of behaviour. He is currently working with police to locate the electrical equipment he says he left at BBC offices. Di Chiera was bailed until October 1 for a pre-sentence report. A BBC spokesman confirmed the corporation was aware of the case but declined to comment.","Dominic Di Chiera puchased series of items including Blu-ray DVD player and LED televisions in attempt to cause trouble for former boss .

Victims of a paedophile gymnastics coach who abused performers as young as six over a 40 year period have spoken of their disgust after he was spared jail. Bob Bellew, 66, admitted abusing girls in his charge during practise sessions at schools and gyms across the country, but was given a suspended prison sentence earlier this month after a judge said he had shown remorse. Now the Crown Prosecution Service backed by victims and police who investigated the crimes have begun proceedings to appeal the 'lenient' sentence, after those affected have spoken of its impact. One witness in the case who was not called after Bellew admitted his campaign of abuse said she could not believe the judge had effectively 'let off' the sex offender. The woman, who asked not to be named but was a member of one of Bellew's gym clubs, said: 'For the judge to say he had shown remorse was just wrong. He didn't show remorse. He foiled the judge completely. 'If you abuse people for 40 years, you don't care what you are doing. I was disappointed that he took into account what he had been through since. It was like they did not take into account the victims at all.' Internationally renowned Bellew, 66, has published books on gymnastics, taught at schools across the UK and was a former Community Coach of the Year. He also served on committees planning the 2012 Olympics and was chief coach of the Tower Hamlets Schools gym and dance display team. Bellew was also awarded the 'Order of the Smile', a UN-recognised citation for adults 'distinguished in their love, care and aid of children'. But he admitted a string of sexual abuse charges, spanning 40 years, against girls he was tutoring. He was spared jail at Snaresbrook Crown Court by a judge who said he had demonstrated 'genuine remorse'. A CPS spokesman said: 'Under the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme the CPS has referred the sentence in the case of Robert Bellew to the Attorney General for him to consider. 'The Attorney General will now decide if this is an appropriate case for him to make an application to the Court of Appeal asking that the Court consider whether this sentence was unduly lenient'. Bellew's outraged victims slammed the justice system in a statement after he was handed the suspended sentence. They said: 'This sentence says you are allowed to go into a primary school and touch young girls and you will not be punished for it. 'This shows everything that is wrong with the British justice system. He has had to live with this for two or three years, but the victims have had it hanging over them their whole lives.' Bellew, who shook uncontrollably throughout the hearing, admitted touching three children while working at a south London primary school in the 1970s. He offered help to three of them with groin injuries, and after removing their clothes he groped them. He touched the daughter of a friend after offering her private tutoring, and another had her thigh stroked when she was invited to his home. Judge Joanna Korner handed Bellew a 15-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) He also admitted touching two teenagers in offences between 1998 and 2004, on the pretext of helping them perform a routine. Judge Joanna Korner handed Bellew a . 15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and banned him from . working with children. She said: 'These were not specimens of a course of conduct, but actually single offences which you engaged against these girls. 'It does seem to me that this is a . case where the punishment has in effect already begun, in the effect . this had on you, for the loss of your standing and the strain of waiting . to find out what would happen. Mercy: Judge Joanna Korner said Bellew had shown remorse even though he blamed victims when questioned for a report . 'Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that this is one of the cases where punishment may be tempered with mercy.' After denying the claims for months, . Bellew suddenly came clean, pleading guilty to eight of 17 charges just . two weeks before he was due to stand trial. Bellew, from New Cross, south east London, admitted seven counts of indecent assault and one of sexual touching. A further nine charges were left to lie on the court file. In a joint statement some of Bellew's . victims who attended court said: 'You get six months in prison for . taking your husband’s speeding points, but you’re allowed to touch a . child under their clothes and you get a suspended sentence.' When asked if they believed his remorse was genuine they said: 'He . stopped shaking soon enough when he realised he wasn't going to prison.' Another victim said this week: 'I was pleased when he admitted it but when he pleaded guilty his supporters said he only did it to get a shorter sentence and they still don't believe that he committed these crimes. 'What Bellew did was a lot worse than the sentence suggests and he should go to jail for what he's done, he should go to jail for at least two years looking at what other people have been sentenced to for similar offences. 'When he walked into court I cried. He looked like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, he was shaking. As soon as they told him he was not going to jail he stopped shaking. It was all an act, definitely. 'I'm pleased that the sentence is being appealed. I want him to go to jail for what he's done. I just want it to be over now.' In a probation report Bellew backed down from his admissions, denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims . Describing the impact on the victims, prosecutor Rekha Kodikara said: . 'One of the victims from the 1970s had excelled in sport, and it had . become for her a place of sanctuary where she felt she could express . herself. 'She said Mr Bellew destroyed that place by what he did. Since that . incident, and over the years since she has felt unable to trust people . in positions of authority. 'The impact of that breach of trust has dogged her for years, she says . she does not trust easily, does not let people into her circle, and it . has seriously affected her marriage and her relationship with her . children.' She described two sets of allegations, the first in the 1970s, and the second in the 1990s and early 2000s. She said: 'The offences would not have occurred but for the position of . trust held by the defendant as a gymnastics coach, which gave him access . to the victims who were young and therefore vulnerable.' Bellew  was due to stand trial in September after pleading not guilty to a number of offences in April last year. However, the second set of allegations came to light after the victims . read news reports of the pending court case and contacted police. Bellew admitted eight of 17 charges against him, involving seven victims as young as six years old. However in a probation report he backed down from his admissions, . denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims. His lawyer Barry Kogan said: 'He has had great difficulty coming to . terms with the shame of what he has done, and this is demonstrated by . what he has told the probation officer, trying to deny his actions, pass . them off as inappropriate not sexual, and blame the victims.' But he said his client's remorse was 'genuine', and asked the judge to ignore the comments in the report. Sentencing him, the judge said: 'You were one of the most highly . regarded gym coaches in this country and much of your life has been . spent doing good to others in particular young people. 'At the same time, for the seven young women, who at the time were . primary school children who had come to you for coaching on the basis of . your reputation and the work you had done, for them you were anything . but a good influence. 'It is clear that the effect of what you did has followed at the very least three of your victims throught their adult lives.' Detective Constable Lewi Fenton, of the Metropolitan Police Service . Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: 'I was shocked at the sentence and . I don't think it will bring closure to the because I saw how upset they . were. 'We must pay tribute to Bellew’s victims who had the courage to come forward. 'His abuse has affected them into their adult lives. 'Bellew taught at schools across the capital, and it is possible that he abused other victims who have not yet come forward. 'We would urge anyone who was assaulted by him to contact their local . police station in the first instance. The MPS can be reached on 101.'","Bob Bellew, 66, admitted sexual abuse charges over 40-year period .

"After their first attempt at marriage, you'd think they would have had enough. But these persistent pensioners have got married again - almost 50 years after they first tied the knot. Valeria Pock, 69, and Gyorgy Bogyay, 82, met and married in 1964 and had a daughter before getting divorced 18 years later. They have been living together as friends for the last two decades and yesterday the couple from Plymouth, Devon, walked down the aisle to exchange vows and pick up where they left off 49 years ago. Rolling back the years: Valeria Pock, 69, and Gyorgy Bogyay, 82, are pictured marrying for the first time in 1964, and re-marrying yesterday after divorcing each other in between . Gyorgy first came to the UK in 1957 fleeing his home country of Hungary following the revolution the previous year. A few years later having qualified for UK citizenship he put an advert in a Hungarian newspaper stating he was looking for a wife. Valeria who was living in the former Yugoslavian Republic replied to the notice and they became pen pals. 'We were writing to each other about a year and a half,' Valeria said. 'He asked me if I would like to marry him and I said yes, so he sent me a one-way ticket to come to England. 'My parents were very upset my sister didn't want me to go. 'She said 'You're so beautiful, you can find any man you like in Yugoslavia so why go to England?' 'She said I should write him a letter and say I can't come as I was ill. 'So I did, but when he received it he didn't believe it.' Gyorgy took a train from London to Belgrade and sent Valeria a telegram asking her to meet him at the train station at 8am the next morning. They went back to England and just a few days later, on May 9, 1964, married at a register office in Reading. Happy day: The pair grew apart and divorced after 18 years of marriage but moved back in together in the early 1990s . Valeria said: 'The funny thing is he never even asked me if I would come and I never asked if he would have me. 'It was just so natural, we just got hold of each other's hands.' Gyorgy added: 'When I saw her I just said she was so beautiful. I said I will spend the rest of my life with her.' In 1966 Valeria fell pregnant with a son but suffered a miscarriage. The couple had better luck four years later when their daughter named Valerie was born. But after 18 years the marriage broke down. Valeria says they just drifted apart and they were divorced in 1982. Both moved on to find new people but neither could make it stick. 'My marriage didn't work out his relationship didn't work so we ended up single again,' Valeria said. In the early 1990s a health scare brought the pair back together. Gyorgy had an operation and had nobody to look after him so Valeria took him in. 'I think I was looking after him too well as he stayed.' she said. 'Ever since then we have been living under the same roof but in separate bedrooms not like man and wife. It has worked very well. 'Living in a strange country we probably just needed each other.' The pair moved to Plymouth six years ago to be closer to their daughter but say they didn't consider themselves a couple until two months ago when Gyorgy raised the subject of Valeria's original wedding ring. 'He asked me if I still had my ring from when we got married in 1964,' Valeria said. 'I said no. So he went out and got one and when he brought it home it fitted me. 'When I put the ring on I said, half-joking, half-serious, ""Well now I've got the ring we'll have to get married again"". 'He got very serious and we decided ""Why not?""' Valeria said she is delighted but stressed that they will stick with their existing living arrangements.'Nothing is going to change,' she said. 'We are going to get married we get a piece of paper and I get a new ring but at our age nothing changes. It's different when you're young. 'With us everything is carrying on as before. 1964 is 49 years ago. We have got a lot of history behind us.' Gyorgy said: 'I was always really in love with her, I could not love any other woman but her. 'I thought if we got married it would be a miracle. Now the miracle has happened.'The couple are now planning to write a book about their life.","Valeria Pock, 69, and Gyorgy Bogyay, 82, met and married in 1964 .

"A married man killed his lover, hid her body and kept up a charade that she was still alive for 18 years, the Old Bailey heard. Kevin Doherty even made two sham calls to himself claiming they were from Jane Harrison, 32. He told police he thought she had gone off with another man, jurors were told. Accused of murder: Jane Harrison, left, was allegedly killed by Kevin Doherty, right, who went on to hide her body and pretend she was still alive, a jury at the Old Bailey was told . She was last seen shopping with him for a holiday they were due to take two days later in June 1995. But the prosecution said he killed her, took her body to a lock-up garage and reported her missing the next day. The body of the mother of two boys has never been found and the evidence against Doherty was only circumstantial, said Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting. 'This case is rather different in a number of respects from many cases tried in this court,' he said. 'The prosecution have no evidence of a dead body. 'We say that although she is dead her body hasn't been discovered. We say there is a reason for this. 'After this defendant killed her he managed to dispose of the body in . such a way as to conceal it from the authorities or anyone else who . might come across it and bring it to the attention of the authorities. 'Another particular feature is this: the prosecution have no direct . evidence that the defendant was responsible for Jane Harrison's death. 'We are not in a position to call any eyewitnesses who claim to have seen the murderous attack and there is no CCTV evidence. 'Indeed, there is no evidence this defendant has ever admitted he killed Jane. 'Instead, the prosecution relies on what is commonly referred to as circumstantial evidence.' Doherty, a married father-of-four who now works as a black cab driver, . claims Miss Harrison had decided to start a new life with another man. But public appeals and searches with Interpol have failed to track her down, the court heard. Doherty and Miss Harrison began a 'volatile, on-off' relationship in . 1992 after they met in a nightclub and had a son together in April 1994. He was married at the time and had a house with his wife in east London, . but would often stay at his lover's flat in Poets Road, Highbury, north . London. Doherty, who worked at the time in a warehouse for craft firm Baker . Ross, took her on lavish holidays to destinations including Tenerife and . the Seychelles. But the pair had begun to have explosive rows in the months before she . disappeared, with Miss Harrison often showing up at his workplace to . quarrel with him. On June 15, 1995, they went to Wood Green Shopping City in north London, . where they bought items including a keyring featuring a picture of . themselves together. Doherty claims he had sex with her in his Ford Escort Cabriolet on the . way and that he dropped her off in Petherton Road, Highbury, so she . could visit her uncle. Never found: Ms Harrison's body has not been found by police, a jury at the Old Bailey (pictured) heard . But Mr Rees said: 'The prosecution contention is that this aspect of his statement is a lie. 'It was a lie that was told to conceal the fact that actually he drove elsewhere for purposes connected to her murder. 'We suggest the lock-up garage he kept in Walthamstow is the most likely destination. 'Plainly it was a perfect place to keep someone he had either abducted or killed.' After returning to Miss Harrison's council flat, Doherty made a series . of phone calls from his mobile to her landline and pretended to others . that he was talking to her. He also told her son Ryan, then aged 14, that he was certain his mother . would return and called a neighbour to say he would go out looking for . his mistress in local pubs. 'But the prosecution say this was just a charade,' said Mr Rees. 'He wasn't looking for her in local pubs. The evidence shows he had driven his car back to the Woodford area. 'The fact is he was effectively manufacturing for himself a false alibi.' Miss Harrison was devoted to her family and the idea she would disappear . without once contacting them was 'beyond fanciful', he added. Doherty had booked a holiday to Florida for the weekend after her . disappearance, but cancelled it after she vanished, the court was told. But with no body and no hard evidence linking him to the disappearance, the investigation was closed on September 1, 1995. Doherty was not re-arrested until May 29 last year. When he was quizzed by police he said he was not a jealous man and . denied he had argued with Miss Harrison in the run-up to her . disappearance. Mr Rees said a few hours after she disappeared, Doherty used his mobile to secretly ring Miss Harrison's flat in Highbury, north London. He picked up the phone and was heard to say: 'Where are you now?' The babysitters said Doherty looked 'sweaty and panicky' and claimed it was Miss Harrison on the phone, saying she would be home later. Mr Rees added: 'This purported phone call was nothing more than a continuation of the charade the defendant had embarked upon. 'This call was not made by Jane Harrison. The call came from his mobile. He was pretending to speak to Jane.' Shortly afterwards, the phone rang again when Miss Harrison's teenage son Ryan returned home and asked where his mother was. He heard Doherty say: 'Don't worry, come home.' Mr Rees said: 'This was the second sham telephone the defendant made to the flat using his mobile phone, pretending to be Jane Harrison. Essentially, he was trying to manufacture an alibi.' Doherty was questioned about her abduction in 1995 but was arrested last year after a murder inquiry was launched. He told officers they had an on-off relationship during the three years they were together, with him sometimes living with his wife. Mr Rees added: 'He said he did not kill Jane Harrison and they had not argued. 'He said he was not a jealous person even though they had split up on a number of occasions. 'He said he kept going back and was besotted with her. It was a sexual thing and he was not in love with her.' Mr Rees said Doherty, who had three children from his marriage, was working as a warehouse manager at the time and often hired vans. Miss Harrison liked going on holidays and he would pay for her and her family to travel to countries such as Portugal. The defendant and Miss Harrison maintained that volatile on-off relationship until her disappearance,' he added. Doherty, 57, of South Woodford, east London, denies murder. The trial was adjourned to tomorrow.

"Under pressure: RBS, led by chief executive Stephen Hester, pictured, is set to be hit by a £150m fine over market rigging . Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be . fined about £150million for participating in market manipulation . offences similar to those engaged in by Barclays, it has been revealed. Sources . said RBS has admitted guilt of offences similar to those committed by . Barclays' traders, though at RBS they were more isolated and less . serious. And today, as more . revelations trickled out about the unfolding scandal, the bank's chief . executive Stephen Hester said he will not take a bonus this year . following problems experienced by the company’s NatWest bank. The news comes after a sacked RBS trader accused his bank bosses of colluding with staff to rig the financial markets to maximise profits in an explosive set of court documents revealed today. The . bank is thought to have accepted that it will probably have to pay . about half as much as the £291 million in fines imposed on Barclays, . according to the Times. Any settlement with the various regulatory authorities is thought to be several months off, the Times said. Stephen . Hester, the CEO of RBS, will now face the same tough questions that . have bombarded his Barclays counterpart Bob Diamond, who has come under . increasing pressure to resign in the wake of the scandal. Barclays . agreed on Wednesday to pay a record $453 million fine to US and British . regulators for attempting to manipulate the London Interbank Offered . Rate in 2005-08. Britain's . banking woes deepened today as the Financial Services Authority said it . had settled with four banks - Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Lloyds - after . finding evidence they mis-sold products to protect small businesses . against a rise in interest rates. Compensation . could run into the hundreds of millions of pounds, lawyers have said, . although Lloyds said the cost for it would not be material. The . FSA said from 2001 to date, banks sold around 28,000 interest rate . protection products to customers, although it did not did not say how . much it would cost the banks. Guilty: RBS admitted guilt for offences similar to those committed by Barclays' traders, though at RBS they were more isolated and less serious . A string of mis-selling cases has . rocked the financial services industry for over two decades and banks . are already likely to pay upwards of £9 billion in compensation for . mis-selling loan insurance. The Libor mis-selling scandal is . expected to draw in many banks globally, but Diamond has found himself . first in the firing line after U.S. and British authorities fined . Barclays $450 million on Wednesday for manipulating the London interbank . offer rate (Libor). Under fire: The Libor mis-selling scandal is expected to draw in many banks globally, but Barclays boss Diamond has found himself first in the firing line . Prime Minister David Cameron said . Diamond - who was running the investment banking arm Barclays Capital . when the rigging occurred in 2005-2009 - and other bosses had some 'big . questions to answer'. Britain also called in the fraud squad to investigate possible crimes. 'Politicians . have already been baying for blood and calling for the head of Bob . Diamond, especially as he was in charge at BarCap at the time,' said . Stephen Peak, manager of the Henderson UK Alpha and European Absolute . Return funds and a shareholder in the bank. 'We . feel that the Barclays board will instinctively wish to resist this, as . Diamond is clearly the architect and leading light of Barclays, but . feel that the pressure may be too great.' Earlier, Tan Chi Min, a former head of delta . trading for RBS’s global banking and markets division in Singapore, . alleged that managers at RBS condoned collusion between its staff to set the . Libor rate artificially high or low to maximise profits. He . named five staff members he claims made requests for the Libor rate to . be altered and three senior managers who he said knew what was going on. He also says the practice 'was known to other members of [RBS]’s senior management'. Mr . Tan, who was eventually sacked for gross misconduct, worked for RBS . from August 2006 to November 2011and alleges that senior members of . staff knew about Libor fixing, and that the behaviour started while Fred . Goodwin was chief executive . During his dismissal case he accused Brevan Howard, one of Europe's largest hedge funds, of asking RBS to change the Libor rate. He accused the fund of telephoning the bank on in August 2007 asking if they could change the bank's Libor submission. Investigation: The ex-RBS employee alleges that senior members of staff knew about Libor fixing, and that the behaviour started while Fred Goodwin was chief executive . Banks submit their rates to Thomson . Reuters which then calculates the Libor rate and distributes it on . behalf of the British Bankers' Association. The fund was not named in the court case and was not being sued for any wrongdoing. Tan alleged that it was in fact common . practice among senior RBS employees to make requests to the bank's rate . setters as to the appropriate Libor rate. In . the court papers filed in New York as part of a class action, Mr Lin . also implicates hedge fund bosses who have given thousands of pounds to . the Conservative Party. It . is claimed that hedge fund Brevan Howard asked RBS to fix financial data . by making false submissions. The fund donated £10,000 to the Tories and . spent £3,542 on flights for George Osborne to attend a conference in . 2008. RBS said it was confident of mounting a successful defence against Mr Tan’s claims.","RBS boss Stephen Hester says he will not take a bonus in the wake of the scandal .

"This is the moment a rare World War Two German float plane was raised from its saltwater grave virtually intact – almost 70 years after it sank. The twin-engined Heinkel He-115 torpedo bomber was hoisted out of the water by engineers and divers in a recovery operation in a fjord near Stavanger, Norway. Now there are hopes the plane will be restored to its former glory and may one day fly again despite it sinking 120ft down to the silty sea floor in 1942 after it was damaged during a botched water landing. Scroll down for video . Emerging from the depths: The tail section of the Heinkel He-115 is pulled from the fjord off Stavanger, Norway after spending almost 70 years under water . Restoration begins: Volunteers and engineers prepare the floatplane for transportation after it was lifted by crane to the shore . Nose section: The remains of the aircraft aircraft are in remarkably good condition, including the perspex around the cockpit and one of the engines, left . The decision to attempt to recover Heinkel 8L+FH was made after its discovery in 2005 during sonar-equipment testing by the Norwegian Mapping Authority. Divers found the aircraft, along with two bombs, which were removed and later destroyed. The condition of the plane is considered to be remarkable, owing to it having lain in low-oxygen silt in a part of the fjord where currents are minimal. Tailplane: The Nazi swastika and identification number is clearly visible next to the plane's rudder . Recovery operation: Years in the planning, last month's raising of the bomber was the result of sponsorship of local companies . Wing section: Although showing some minor damage to the tips, the plane's wings appear strong despite decades in salty water . After a fundraising effort by enthusiasts and sponsorship from local firms, volunteers were last month able to raise it from the depths leaving it suspended below the surface from a barge. It was then transported to the shore in Hafrsfjord by tugs and crane-lifted out of the water. Before the final lift divers spent several hours washing out silt from within the aircraft to reduce the weight and the risk of the plane breaking apart when it was moved. First glimpse: Divers and other volunteers take a peek into the plane's interior through its damaged nose cone . Propellers: Just one BMW engine remains on the plane after German engineers removed the other in 1942 after a botched landing led to the plane sinking . Crowd-pleaser: Local people watched the bomber lifted from the waves by crane . Oliver Scott, 31, a British oil worker who witnessed the recovery, said: ‘It was extraordinary to see plane emerge from the water looking as if it was only lost yesterday. ‘It was in remarkably good condition, you could see the swastika on the tail plane and a machine gun still had a belt of ammunition attached.’ Armament: The plane's protective machine gun is handled by a worker. An ammunition belt can still be seen leading into the weapon . Carried away: A diver in a heavy-duty wetsuit takes a weapon away, left, while workers inspect the engine, right . Rare find: The plane is the only salvaged Heinkel He-115 in existence and there are hopes it can be restored to flying condition . Recovery workers then took the plane to Sola Airport in Stavanger where aircraft museum workers dismantled it into five sections before placing it in a freshwater tank where it will remain for two years. The museum is already restoring a number of rare wartime aircraft, including a Messerschmitt BF-109G, an Italian Caproni bomber and a German Arado trainer, in addition to a BMW engine identical to the ones originally fitted to the Heinkel. Crew: 3Length: 56ft 9inWingspan: 73ft 1inHeight: 21ft 7inEngines: 2 BMW 132K 9-cylinder radialMax speed: 203mphCombat radius 1,305 milesCeiling: 17,100ftGuns: . 1 × fixed 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine gun and 1 × flexible 7.92 mm . (.312 in) MG 15 machine gun in dorsal and nose positionsBombs: Five 250 kg (550 lb) bombs, or two such bombs and one torpedo of 800 kg (1,760 lb)Mines: One 920 kg (2,030 lb) sea mine . Remnants of silt and saltwater will be removed during the process, preparing it for further restoration in the same hanger from which it operated during World War Two. Purchased by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service from Nazi Germany in 1939, the bomber was later used in the ultimately unsuccessful battle against German forces. The occupying Nazis then commandeered the plane, using it to bomb Allied shipping, reconnaissance and to escort its own vessels. The mid-sized, twin-engined float plane was returning from a convoy escort mission off Jæren when it lost a float on landing and overturned on 29 December 1942. None of the aircrew were lost, and the Germans were able to salvage the starboard engine and floats before the bomber sank and came to rest upside-down just off Prestøya island, less than two nautical miles from its base. Of some 300 aircraft made, 8L+FH is the only salvaged He-115 in existence. Restoration begins: A worker gets inside the plane, before it is placed in five fresh water tanks to be washed . Protection: The seaplane was returning from convoy escort duties when it was damaged in a landing accident . Wartime Nazi bomber: The Heinkel He-115 flying boat, pictured during World War Two, was used to attack shipping and in a reconnaissance role . Found: The plane was discovered by the island of Prestoy, and will be restored in a hanger at Stavanger Airport . A further three 'Norwegian' He-115s have been located in the Trondheimsfjord farther north, although these have been said to be in a comparatively poor state. Hafrsfjord was the scene of an epic Viking naval battle in 872 A.D., which according to most history books was a direct precursor to the unification of Norway, and has previously yielded all manner of artefacts from the Viking era.

"Determined: Jo Bryant, 29, from Horncastle in Lincolnshire has a cardiac sarcoma heart tumour . When keen sportswoman Jo Bryant began collapsing during short runs on the hockey pitch she knew there was something deeply wrong with her body. But the last thing on her mind – and those of her doctors – was that the cause of her rapidly deteriorating health was the rarest form of cancer in the world. Within months, Jo, now 29, was told the cardiac sarcoma heart tumour she was suffering from was terminal and in her words, she ‘wouldn’t be growing old’. Elite sports event organiser Jo recalls the moment doctors were left as shocked as she was after she referred herself to a private specialist. She said: ‘He was amazed I was even walking around. It was assumed to be benign (a myxoma) and I was told that he was 99.99 per cent sure it wasn't cancer. ‘Whatever it was, it had to come out so I had open heart surgery four days later. ‘When I came round from surgery I knew, as soon as I looked into my anaesthetists eyes, that what they had found in there hadn't been what they were expecting. No one would tell me anything though. ‘As I was leaving the hospital 10 days after my surgery, my cardiologist delivered the blow - the unexpected had happened and it was a cardiac sarcoma. He told me I wouldn't be growing old.’ The discovery of the cancer in January last year was the beginning of a gruelling battle against the disease that immediately saw Jo begin 360 hours of chemotherapy. The type of sarcoma Jo was diagnosed with is suffered by just a handful of people around the world. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Star support: After the diagnosis Jo's friends were determined to help in anyway they could and created Team JB in which celebrities, such as Cheryl Cole, left, and Gary Barlow posed for a photo to show their support .

What is sarcoma?Sarcomas are cancers of mesenchymal tissue – the connective tissue which holds the human frame together. Bones, muscles, nerves, tendons, cartilage, fatty and fibrous tissue are the home of these tumours. Almost uniquely among solid tumours, sarcomas can appear anywhere on or inside the body, and at any age. How many people are affected? Current estimates put the total number of sarcomas diagnosed each year in the UK at about 3,200 and this may be an under-estimate due to a lack of clarity in the data. About 15 per cent of patients are children and data suggest that about 30 per cent of patients are aged under 30 years. In England, around 2,300 people are diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma. Around 460 people are diagnosed each year with bone sarcoma in England. What are the different types of sarcoma?There are over 70 different sub-types of sarcoma. Many of these sub-types are extremely rare – just a few patients each year – and have different age profiles. What treatment is available?Surgery is commonly viewed as the best option for a ‘cure’. Radiotherapy is often used in combination with surgery, usually afterwards. Chemotherapy will usually be used with bone sarcomas before and after surgery, although it is less often used with soft tissue sarcoma and only with sub-types known to respond well to chemotherapy. What are the chances of survival?Five-year survival rates for patients diagnosed with a bone sarcoma in 2004 were 55 per cent and for patients diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma were 56 per cent. However, it is important to note that soft tissue sarcoma survival rates vary according to the individual sub-type of sarcoma and can be better or worse than 56 per cent depending on the individual. Lindsey Bennister, chief executive of . Sarcoma UK, said: ‘'Jo has been a phenomenal support to our charity, . raising awareness of sarcoma cancer through her moving and inspirational . blog and social media activity. ‘Having had the pleasure of meeting Jo personally, we have been touched by her motivation and passion for life. 'Her positive attitude is an inspiration to everyone; her enthusiasm and desire to make a difference to others is infectious and reflected in her huge network of supporters and friends who have cycled for miles, ran monthly marathons and donated so generously to Sarcoma UK. ‘Team Bryant has raised over £25,000 in two months towards sarcoma research, information and support. We are enormously grateful to Jo and her friends and family for their financial support, and their amazing ability to turn their hand to any challenge.’ Today Jo, who has moved from London back to the family farm near Horncastle in Lincolnshire, is undergoing further chemotherapy and is also exploring alternative treatments to fight the cancer. She said: ‘Obviously, there are lots of tears from time to time, but overall I try and stay positive and see this is as just another challenge that I will overcome, somehow, no matter how firmly the odds are stacked against me.’ In February, doctors gave Jo 6-12 months to live and the option of further gruelling chemotherapy. She said: ‘It was a really difficult decision to make as chemo seriously affects the quality of your life and having gone through it once, I wasn't sure I could do it again, especially as they were saying that it may or may not prolong my life. ‘I decided in the end to give it a go, and the first lot of scans show that it is working, and the tumours are shrinking which is the best news I could have hoped for. ‘That said, they are not saying they can cure me and I want to be cured, and I believe I can be. There are a huge amount of other things out there to try and so I am doing just that: I have overhauled my diet, and am trying reflexology, aromatherapy, acupuncture, visual imagery and meditation. ‘So, the future for now, is all about exploring all of the alternatives and taking control back from the doctors to try and help myself, while at the same time trying to raise money for and awareness of sarcoma. ‘It's so easy to just put your life in the doctors hands and believe what they say, but statistics are just statistics and there are always anomalies. I will never give up and that is my promise to all my friends and family.' NOW WATCH A VIDEO ABOUT LIVING WITH SARCOMA .

"'Explosive' revelations pinning some of the blame for the Libor-fixing scandal on the Bank of England are expected when Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond gives evidence to MPs on Wednesday. Traders apparently 'mistakenly' believed the Bank was happy for them to fix the rate, following a telephone call between Mervyn King's deputy Paul Tucker and a 'senior' Barclays manager now reported to be Mr Diamond. The Bank of England has categorically denied anything to do with fiddling the rate which banks borrow money at - which in turn affects how much they charge borrowers on products including mortgages and credit cards. Scroll down for video . 'Explosive': Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond (left) could give testimony about his discussions with the Bank if England, whose deputy governor is Paul Tucker (right) The Daily Mail revealed on Saturday that rumours were swirling in Whitehall about what discussions the Bank and the Treasury had with banks about Libor. The rate acts as a crucial indicator of the health of the banking sector, and therefore the wider economy. In 2007, experts began to express concern that the rate was rising, suggesting banks were becoming wary of lending to each other. According to two separate official reports prepared on both sides of the Atlantic, a senior Barclays official and a senior figure at the Bank talked on October 29, 2008. WHAT IS LIBOR? It . stands for the London interbank offer rate and is the interest banks . charge to borrow from each other. Banks rely on this money to lend to . customers and businesses. Its equivalent in Europe is called Euribor.HOW DOES IT AFFECT ME? The . rate banks pay to raise money affects how much they charge on loans and . mortgages.  An increase in Libor can add hundreds of pounds to . households’ annual mortgage repayments or a loan to a small business. This . was seen with dramatic effect in the run up to the financial crisis, . when Libor soared and lenders raised their rates. It is also used as the . benchmark for trillions of pounds in complex financial investments. Three-month sterling Libor from 2006 to 2012: The rate broadly runs in line with the UK base rate except for the crunch period in 2008 and in recent months . HOW IS IT SET? The . rate is set every morning by a panel of banks and overseen by trade . body the British Bankers’ Association. Each bank sets the rates at which . it believes it can borrow, from overnight to 12 months. There are 150 . Libor rates, spanning ten currencies and 15 time periods.WHAT HAS BARCLAYS BEEN DOING? Barclays’ traders speculating on movements in interest rates were manipulating Libor in an effort to make huge profits. Its . traders were conspiring with the ‘submitters’ at the bank which lodge . their Libor rates every morning. Depending on the way they were betting, . traders would urge these submitters to increase the Libor rate or lower . it. Barclays’ traders also . conspired with ex-employees working at other banks to try to influence . their Libor submissions. During the financial crisis Barclays also . fiddled the figures to dupe the market into thinking it was more . financially sound than it was. Libor . is often seen as a barometer of how healthy a bank is. Just as . customers with bad credit records have to pay higher interest rates, . banks which are deemed in poor financial health are charged more to . borrow. Barclays became . anxious that its Libor rate was higher than many of its peers and that . they were fiddling the figures. It decided to join the party.ARE ANY OTHER BANKS DOING THIS? It is likely this is just the tip of the iceberg. Barclays is just the first to get caught. For . the last two years a dozen regulators on three continents have been . combing through the files of more than 20 banks involved in the rate . setting process. Swiss bank . UBS is understood to have already suspended a number of traders, as has . the Royal Bank of Scotland. Lloyds, and HSBC last week said they were . helping the Financial Services Authority with its inquiries. The Bank official is alleged to have asked why Barclays’ Libor submissions were higher than those of other banks. The Financial Services Authority’s report on Barclays published on Wednesday said Mr Tucker spoke with a senior Barclays manager now known to be Mr Diamond on October 29 in a routine telephone call. In it, he made ‘no instruction for Barclays to lower its Libor submissions’. But the report added: ‘However, as the substance of the telephone conversation was relayed down the chain of command at Barclays, a misunderstanding or miscommunication occurred. ‘This meant that Barclays’ submitters believed mistakenly that they were operating under an instruction from the Bank of England (as conveyed by senior management) to reduce Barclays’ Libor submissions.’ Casting his mind back: Mr Diamond, who is facing calls to resign, is understood to have a 'different recollection' of discussions between Barclays and the Bank to that held by Mr Tucker . Submitters are the managers who give borrowing data to the British Bankers Association’s Libor-setting committees. The FSA report refers to ‘a telephone conversation between a senior individual at Barclays and the Bank of England during which the external perceptions of Barclays’ Libor submissions were discussed’. Under scrutiny: Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond (left), with Marcus Agius, who is resigning as the bank's chairman . According to the BBC’s business editor Robert Peston, no contemporaneous minute or recording of the conversation was made, but Mr Diamond and Mr Tucker ‘have different recollections of it’. US documents conclude that Mr Tucker did not give any instruction to artificially depress the interest rates. A Bank of England spokesman said: ‘It is nonsense to suggest the Bank of England was aware of any impropriety in the setting of Libor. ‘If we had been aware of attempts to manipulate Libor, we would have treated them very seriously.’ But the fact that the pair were talking about Libor at a time when Barclays was submitting false information will leave Mr Diamond, who is due to testify to Parliament on Wednesday, facing difficult questions. The conversation could also prove awkward for Mr Tucker, who is a leading candidate to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor next year, as well as prompting questions about whether the Treasury had any similar discussions with the banks. Business Secretary Dr Cable said yesterday that the public wanted to see bankers prosecuted if they had committed criminal offences, and revealed that ministers would launch a consultation this week on criminal sanctions for directors of failed banks. ‘If there has been criminal activity people must be brought before the courts,’ he told Sky News. Dr Cable added: ‘[The public] just can’t understand why people are thrown into jail for petty theft and these guys just walk away having perpetrated what looks like a conspiracy.’ However, Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, said Libor-fixing did not fall foul of the current law. A Bank of England spokesman confirmed that Mr Tucker was one of the parties involved. He said: ‘The call referred to in the report was one of many regular market calls made by the Bank of England, in this case by Paul Tucker.’ A Barclays spokesman declined to comment.","Phone call between 'Bob Diamond' and Paul Tucker is said to have led to traders 'mistakenly' believing they had Bank of England backing to fix Libor .

"It is an engine whose distinctive roar can make the heart leap. The successor of the great Merlin engine, the Rolls Royce Griffon also played its part in helping to win the Second World War when it was fitted to iconic warbirds such as the Spitfire. Now three excellent examples of the type are set to go under the hammer and sell for thousands of pounds. Piston power:  Auction house worker Kirsty Gardner is pictured with the . three Griffon engines which provided the power for British planes such . as the Spitfire towards the end of the Second World War and beyond . Things of beauty: Two of the giant Rolls Royce Griffon engines that will sold at auction. The type propelled later model Spitfires in the Second World War . The three 36.7 litre V12 engines were . used in Supermarine Spitfires and the four-engined post-war Avro . Shackleton - and are examples of the advanced technology which helped . achieve superiority over the Germans. Today just one Shackleton and fewer . than 60 Spitfires originally fitted with one of these engines are still . flying anywhere in the world. Iconic: The positioning of the 12 pistons in a 'V'-shape gives the Rolls Royce engine its distinctive shape . And the majority of the left-over engines were disposed of after the War - some even tipped down a mine shaft just to get rid of them. The mammoth engines were discovered in a barn in Derbyshire during a house call to see furniture and ‘some stuff in the shed’ and are expected to make more than £10,000 each. Bamfords Auctioneer Steven Iredale said: 'These extremely rare pieces of British history have been saved from destruction for more than 30 years. Maritime reconnaissance: The Griffon engines powered the Avro Shackleton, a post-war Coastal Command aircraft used for sea patrols . Nation's favourite: A Supermarine Spitfire, they type which was eventually fitted with superior Griffon engines . The Griffon was the . last in the line of V-12 aero engines to be produced by Rolls-Royce with . production ceasing in 1955. Griffon engines remain in Royal Air Force . service today with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and also power . the last remaining airworthy Avro Shackleton - which flies in South Africa. In line with Rolls-Royce . convention the Griffon was named after a bird of prey, in this case the . Griffon Vulture and was commissioned by the Fleet Air Arm as a larger, . more powerful version of the Merlin engine for use in naval aircraft. Although the Griffon was designed for naval aircraft, on 8 November 1939 . N. E. Rowe of the Air Ministry suggested fitting the Griffon in a . Supermarine Spitfire and this was achieved in 1941. Spitfire XII's were . the first recipient of the Griffon, a number of subsequent Spitfires . retained Merlin power but towards the end of Spitfire production all . were powered by Griffons. Towards the end of . the war Coastal Command found a need for a new . land-based Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft culminating in . Specification R5/46, which became the Avro Shackleton, a descendant of . the Lincoln and Lancaster bombers, with four Griffon engines. The . Shackleton first flew in 1949 and the MK 1A Shackleton, with uprated . Griffon 57A engines entered service with 120 Sqn. in April 1951. Production of the Griffon ceased in 1955 a total of 8,108 being built. 'They were part of a collection belonging to Dan Taylor who has dedicated his life to the preservation and conservation of Vintage Aircraft. 'He had rescued these engines which he thought were of little worth as well as saving the original patterns for the legendary World War Two Merlin engine from a skip. 'While serving with the RAF he was involved in the making of the Dambusters movie, and almost every Spitfire still flying today owes something to his expertise - he is a real unsung hero of British military aviation history. 'The sale will also include his extensive collection of aircraft parts including propellers, an anti-gravity test rig and a Spitfire gun camera. 'It’s one of the most unusual and exciting sales we have ever handled and has already attracted worldwide interest. 'It’s something we have never dealt with before and even more unusual as we only went to see the furniture in his house and shed and came across these two and a half tonne nine foot giants.' Other items that will excite aviation fans include a Stromberg injection carburetor which was part of a P51 Mustang engine. The lots also include pistons believed to have come from a Merlin engine as well as 13 magneto generators that date from both world wars and some from the present day. The three identical engines are Rolls Royce Griffon mk.58 V12s. The 36.7 litre supercharged engines are capable of producing 1,960 horse power and are liquid-cooled. One has no flying hours left and was removed from R.A.F. 8 Squadron . Avro Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft WL745 1980. Another has 62 flying hours remaining and was removed from R.A.F. 8 Squadron Avro Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft WL747 1980. Both are mounted on wooden stands and are dated approximately 1952. The collection will form part of Bamfords mammoth four-day Antique, Fine Art and Collectors’ Sale from 26-29 June. Remarkable find: The engines are in reasonable conditions despite being stored in a barn for 30 years . Mark of quality: The Rolls-Royce branding on the engine casing. the company's factory produced more than 8,000 of the type . A piece of history: This label shows the engines were removed by a Sergeant Grimbly at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and give safety notes about the coolant system, fuel injectors and piston cylinders .","36.7 litre V12 Rols Royce Griffon engine was the power behind later examples of the Supermarine Spitfire and the Avro Shackleton .
