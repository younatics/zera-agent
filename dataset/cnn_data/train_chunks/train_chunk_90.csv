"New York (CNN) -- He was one cool cat, trekking half way across America before meeting an untimely death by car on a Connecticut parkway. The 1,500-mile feline journey is a ""testament to the wonders of nature and the tenacity"" of the species, said Daniel Esty, commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. It was one of the longest known movements ever recorded for a land mammal and nearly double the distance for a mountain lion, the agency said. There had been sightings of the large cat in Greenwich, Connecticut, its presence an anomaly in a state where none has been seen in more than a century. Sadly, it was the cat's death that helped tie everything together. A 2006 Hyundai Tucson SUV hit and killed the animal in the very early hours of June 11. Police were informed of a collision between a vehicle and a mountain lion in the northbound lane, near exit 55, of Wilbur Cross Parkway in Milford. A necropsy and genetic tests revealed the lion's origins and travels, the Connecticut environmental agency said. The young, lean mountain lion hailed from the Black Hills of South Dakota, making its way east 18 months ago in search of a mate. Normally the majestic male cats don't wander beyond 100 milles while looking for females. But this one kept going, through Minnesota and Wisconsin, where its sightings were recorded and DNA evidence collected from droppings, blood and hair. In Wisconsin, biologists dubbed the animal the ""St. Croix Mountain Lion,"" after the first county where a sighting was confirmed . The cat was not neutered or declawed, the necropsy showed, meaning that it was probably not a captive animal that escaped or was released. It also had porcupine quills stuck in the tissue under its skin, indicating that it had spent some time in the wild. Analysis of an extracted tooth could help determine a precise age for the cat, believed to have been between 2 and 5 years old. Wildlife experts were still examining the cat, including the contents of its stomach. They could still learn more in the days ahead.","The mountain lion was sighted in several states .

"(CNN) -- European champions Barcelona have agreed to sell forward Bojan Krkic to Italian club Roma for $17.3 million. Barcelona have an option to buy back the 20-year-old for $18.7 million at the end of the 2012-13 season, but Luis Enrique's Roma can override the clause if they pay the Spanish champions a further $40 million. Bojan's exit follows Thursday's announcement that the Catalan side had captured Chile winger Alexis Sanchez from Udinese. The one-cap Spain international made his Barca debut in 2007, and scored seven times last season despite being a fringe member of Josep Guardiola's team. Barca land Chile star Sanchez . ""I want to be happy about football again. I am 20 years old and I want to continue demonstrating what I couldn't here,"" he told reporters on Friday after confirming the end of his 12-year stay at the Nou Camp. ""Especially this last year there has been a lack of confidence in me. I didn't get much continuity, and that hurts, but I am also aware of things and consider myself privileged to have been part of such a magnificent team. These were four great years. I take away the positive aspects."" Roma finished sixth in Serie A last season under interim coach Vincenzo Montella, the club's former striker who replaced Claudio Ranieri as boss in February. Enrique, 41, was appointed at the Stadio Olimpico last month after a three-year spell as coach of Barca's B team. The former Spain international spent eight years as a player at the Nou Camp between 1996-2004. Diego Capel has followed his national under-21 teammate Bojan in leaving Spain, with the Sevilla winger joining Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon for $5 million on a five-year contract. The 23-year-old became the 12th player to sign for new coach Domingos Paciencia, having helped Spain win the European U21 Championship in May. Capel made his league debut for the Andalusian club as a 16-year-old in October 2004, and won the last of his two senior Spain caps nearly three years ago. Domingos guided Braga to the Europa League final last season, losing to Porto, and was subsequently appointed to replace Sporting's caretaker manager Jose Couceiro -- who joined Russia's Lokomotiv Moscow. Turkish club Galatasaray announced the signing of Brazil midfielder Felipe Melo on a season-long loan from Italian side Juventus on Friday. The 28-year-old joins Sweden striker Johan Elmander and Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera in joining the Istanbul team, now coached by former Turkey boss Fatih Terim after finishing only eighth in the domestic league last season. Galatasaray paid a loan fee of $2.15 million, and must deliver another $18.5 million to secure Melo on a permanent basis at the end of next season. Scotland striker Kenny Miller is poised to make a quick return to Britain after passing a medical with English second division team Cardiff on Friday. His former club Rangers had tried to re-sign him from Bursaspor, but the Turkish club rejected the Scottish champions' offer. The 31-year-old scored five goals in 15 games following his move to Bursa in January on a two-and-a-half-year deal.","Barcelona sell young forward Bojan Krkic to Italian side Roma in a deal worth $17.3 million .

"(CNN) -- Investigators Wednesday exhumed the body of a 7-year-old Illinois girl slain more than five decades ago in hopes that modern science will bolster the case against the man now accused of killing her. The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. ""Suffice to say science has advanced greatly, thankfully, since that time and we're hoping that advancement in science can assist us in our investigation of this case,"" Campbell said. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. Her body was found five months later and 120 miles away. Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend. But when police interviewed the woman again in 2010 and asked if she had any photos of McCullough, she discovered an unused train ticket from Rockford to Chicago that she said he had given her on the date of the crime. The discovery led to McCullough's arrest in Seattle in early July. Campbell said Wednesday that McCullough was en route to Illinois from Washington state to face murder charges in Ridulph's death. Maria's brother, Charles Ridulph, appeared at a news conference with Campbell and said the family had agreed to the exhumation. ""Although the events were very difficult and very unsettling, we understand the necessity for these things, and we are in complete agreement and thankful for the way this case is being handled,"" he said.","Maria Ridulph's remain were exhumed Wednesday, 54 years after her death .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India and Pakistan Wednesday pledged not to let their fragile peace process slide again because of thorny issues that have made the nuclear neighbors bitter enemies. Pakistan's new Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar met her Indian counterpart S.M. Krishna in New Delhi in an engagement that saw no major breakthroughs over outstanding disputes but a commitment to pursue dialogue. Their talks came barely two weeks after three deadly explosions ripped through Mumbai, an attack that revived memories of the 2008 terror siege of India's financial hub. Pakistan was quick to condemn the July 13 bombings of Mumbai while New Delhi was careful not to finger Islamabad. ""This is indeed a new era of bilateral cooperation between the two countries and it is our desire, and I believe after having spoken to you mister foreign minister, that it is the desire and commitment of both the governments to make it an uninterrupted and uninterruptable process,"" Khar remarked, standing beside the Indian leader after their meeting. In his comments, Krishna too acknowledged sustained negotiations were the way forward. ""We have reaffirmed our commitment to resolve all outstanding issues through a comprehensive, serious and sustained dialogue. While being fully cognizant of the challenges that lie ahead, I can confidently say that our relations are on the right track,"" he said. ""We have some distance to travel, but with an open mind and a constructive approach, which has been demonstrated in this round of dialogue, I am sure we can reach our desired destination of having a friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries,"" Krishna added. As part of their confidence-building measures, both sides agreed to double the frequency of trade across Kashmir -- the disputed region divided between the countries -- to four days a week. The current three-year agreement involves 21 locally made items, which a joint statement issued after the talks said would be reviewed for possible additions. India and Pakistan have have fought three wars since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947, two of them over Kashmir, which both nations claim. ""The ministers held discussions on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and agreed to the need for continued discussions, in a purposeful and forward looking manner, with a view to finding a peaceful solution by narrowing divergences and building convergences,"" the joint statement noted. Earlier this year, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume peace talks frozen by the 2008 Mumbai strikes, which have been blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups. Under U.S. pressure, Indian and Pakistani leaders held meetings last year in a bid to put their dialogue back on track, but no dramatic headway has been made. In 2004, the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues, including Kashmir, terrorism and Pakistan's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border, which it sees as a threat to its water supplies. Since then, successive governments have held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari hailed results from the dialogue in September 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings. But talks were suspended two months later, in November 2008, after the terror raid on Mumbai that left more than 160 people dead.","Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers meet .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- It's been more than five months since Indonesians have seen the latest Hollywood flicks on the big screen. But cinema owners say the long wait is now over, with monster hit ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" releasing on Friday. Djonny Sjafruddin, head of the Indonesian Cinema Companies Union, says blockbusters ""Transformers 3"" and ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" will follow a few weeks later. In February major Hollywood studios stopped distributing films to Indonesia, after the government said it would impose a new royalty tax on imported movies. That led to a protracted dispute between the government and the country's movie distributors. Sjafruddin says a new tax scheme is now in place, eliminating the royalty tax but increasing import duties by 100%. Earlier this month, many Indonesians looked on enviously as long-awaited summer blockbusters screened in cinemas around the globe. Some made their way to neighboring Singapore. Avid movie enthusiast Erza Setyadarma flew to the city state and watched Harry Potter and five other movies in just three days. He was not alone. ""I was shocked to see so many Indonesians there. We bumped into almost everyone we knew, in all the cinemas"", he says. There were enough Indonesians in Singapore for at least one theater chain to offer them a free pass for every eight movie tickets. The short flight is relatively inexpensive, so this became a common last resort among Indonesians who had the means. Many others resorted to buying pirated DVDs on the black market or settled for second-tier foreign movies and locally made flicks. Setyadarma heads the Indonesian Opera Society and is a supporter of the arts and movies. Many like him are appalled that Indonesians were deprived of quality films for so long. ""We're supposed to be a progressive, modern country and we can't see a decent movie. It's ridiculous"", he says. According to the Cinema Companies Union, there are 16 film distribution companies but the two largest previously brought in films by Hollywood's major studios. Shortly after the boycott was announced, the government ordered three film importers to pay a total of 31 billion rupiah ($3.6 million dollars) in unpaid taxes. One importer has paid up but the two larger ones are still contesting it in court and are still banned from importing films. Sjafruddin says the government is auditing all the other distributors. A new distribution company was then given a permit to import ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"" ""Transformers 3"" and ""Kung Fu Panda 2."" While moviegoers express relief over the news, others doubt the real issues have been resolved. Advertising executive Ricky Pesik and his family also squeezed in as many movies into their recent Singapore holiday. Pesik says ""the real problem is fair business practice in movie distribution"". Setyadarma applauds the government for clamping down on the errant distributors but adds ""the tax issue isn't the problem. The problem is the monopoly. I can't stand it. Why not open up the distribution to others? I love playing the game of Monopoly but it shouldn't be applied in real life"". In this game, moviegoers and local cinemas have been the biggest losers. Syamsul Lusa, director of film at the Ministry of Tourism and Culture, says the absence of marquee films in Indonesia has taken its toll on local cinemas, citing a decrease in business of roughly 30% to 40% over the last four months. Sjafruddin says income from the taxes dropped 50% in the first quarter of 2011, from 3.9 billion rupiah to only 1.8 billion rupiah. Movie fans are sure to pack theaters when the final Harry Potter installment releases on Friday. The dispute has played out like an extended suspense flick and many in Indonesia hope it's reached the end of its reel.

He also went to Munich to see the new technology that will revolutionize golf fashion and looks at a golfer's susceptibility to harmful UV rays. Here's Tony's monthly blog for Living Golf: . Dunhill week with Samuel L. Jackson ""My favorite week of the year. Spending time with some of the most admired people in the world, although many were missing this year. No Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones or Bill Murray. However, with the wonderful atmosphere that only St Andrews can give, there was plenty of fun to have. Mr Qool (Samuel L. Jackson), who had enjoyed all the compliments wearing his Q'aja's at the Bob Hope earlier in the year, asked us to design something appropriate for the first day of Dunhill this year. With the great Scottish culture and weather (rumor has it that it rains there) in mind, I put together a cream and black, bold tartan trouser with the Q factor of cream trims worn with a silk black polo and a cream angora jumper. Fortunately the rain stayed away on Thursday (I promised ""Him up there"" a Q VIP outfit) so Sam looked fantastic -- even Tim Henman and Michael Campbell (both have used Q'aja in past) wished they had the courage.

Jackson, Tim Henman, Sir Steve Redgrave and Sean Fitzgerald, to name a few -- wonderfully organized as always by Netjets supremo Rob Hersov and the lovely Claire -- thanks guys.

Could it have been the fact the beer festival was going on at the same time or is the German market not as big as I thought it was? However, it did give me the chance to witness the amazing Ion-Mask. Ion-Mask is a gas treatment to a product through a gas chamber, which applies a nanometer thick protective layer that will make the product water repellent, and gives protection against scuffs and stains without affecting the breathability. Although it's in its early stages, I am really excited about this innovation. This could change the apparel industry totally. The first item to be Ion-Masked is a golf shoe by Hi-Tec, which was on the stand with water pouring onto it and yes, amazingly, the water just slid off... wow! No, people, I don't think you'll be able to do it to yourself so you never have to wash again. Skin cancer Now, you know how much I am into health in sport. Well, my partners Sunderland of Scotland have come out with a collection with a very high UV factor of 50. This basically means that the yarn the fabric is made from has gone through a treatment which gives protection from sun rays. We don't realize how vulnerable we are to the natural elements from four to five hours of continuous sun rays. I am glad that the National Cancer Institute is getting involved in the awareness of this disregarded health risk.

She's wearing stunning, large, hoop earrings crafted by her mother. Her energy, warm and embracing, is big enough to blow out a nearby spotlight. ""Did I do that?"" she calmly asks. ""No,"" I assure her as I try to get the attention of my shooter/producer/editor to resolve the problem. I ask the singer what I should call her. She seems surprised and tells me to please call her ""Chaka."" I respond that my stepdaughter is also named ""Chaka."" Her face lights up. ""People usually name their dogs after me,"" she whispers, as though we are girlfriends sharing a funny secret. But she keeps no secrets during our interview. She says she'll answer just about any question, and she does. Chaka tells funny stories and shares pivotal moments, a few of them sad. She apologizes for not remembering anything about her childhood, but later sent some of her baby pictures. The one thing she recalls from way back when, however, is that she always wanted to be an anthropologist. Her singing career allowed her to become one, she says. She loves children and cries when she relives the day she realized she could not have a conversation with her nephew Tallon, who has autism. I remind her of how many people she's helping through her Chaka Khan Foundation, which has raised more than $4 million. The foundation says it ""is dedicated to assisting women and children at risk with a particular emphasis on education and autism."" Through tears, she smiles, ""I hope so. I hope so."" Her ""God Shots,"" as she calls her ""aha"" moments, keep coming. She loves life and each moment God gives her, she says. Her latest special moment was during a flight with an autistic boy who was ""talking, talking, talking"" as he got on the plane, she recalls. A storm during the flight made everyone including him go silent. However, when the plane landed safely, the boy announced, ""We're all back now."" That's right, she reflected. It was like a homecoming, a shot at life again. After our conversation, she won't leave the room until she sees a picture of my little Chaka. My husband gladly thumbs through his iPhone for photos of his daughter. Chaka Khan says she is ""just Chaka."" Her CNN Red Chair Interview shows that she's someone to remember.

"(CNN) -- Two-time African footballer of the year El-Hadji Diouf has been banned from international football for five years by the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF). The ban follows comments the striker, who plays for English club Blackburn Rovers, made in the media relating to corruption in African football. In a statement posted on their official web site the FSF said Diouf would be forbidden ""from performing any football-related activity for a period of five years with effect from the date of notification of this decision."" The FSF accused Diouf of ""having greatly damaged the image of both Senegalese football and of its officers and administrative techniques."" In an interview with Radio France International Diouf said ""the whole system of African football is corrupt"" and spoke of ""shenanigans"" and ""scams"" within Senegalese soccer. The FSF claim Diouf failed to appear at a disciplinary hearing earlier this month, though the player denied having been informed about it in a subsequent interview with French sports magazine Stade. He also claimed he would ""go to war"" with the Senegalese football authorities if it followed through on its threat to ban him. Controversy has followed Diouf throughout his career in the UK, where he has played for Liverpool, Celtic, Sunderland and Bolton.

"(CNN) -- The long-time companion of notorious fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger has sold her share of her family's Boston home for $1 to her twin sister, according to registry records. Catherine Greig, who faces charges of harboring a fugitive, appeared in court July 13 for a detention hearing. The government has 30 days from the hearing day to indict Greig, who is being held without bail. In an apparent move to protect her assets, Greig sold ""all my rights, title and interest"" in the house and land in South Boston to Margaret McCusker, according to a filing with the Suffolk Registry of Deeds. Greig also sought to protect her $343,700 home in Quincy by declaring it covered by the state's Homestead Act, the Boston Globe reported. The house could be safe from creditors as long as she can prove it is her primary residence, the newspaper said. During Greig's detention hearing, her attorney, Kevin Reddington, told the judge that his client was a ""kind, gentle person"" who had a ""loving personality."" Prosecutors released a series of photographs showing cash, weapons and even a grenade recovered from the Santa Monica, California, apartment that she apparently shared with Bulger for 15 years while he was being hunted by the FBI. The government also released a brief security camera video of Greig walking in and out of a local drugstore, picking up a prescription, prosecutors said, that was under an assumed name. Bulger and Greig were known in Santa Monica as Charles and Carol Gasko. Bulger has pleaded not guilty to all counts against him, including his alleged role in 19 murders. Prosecutors say Bulger was the head of a South Boston Irish gang before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995. At the same time, he was an FBI informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges. The reputed mobster became the inspiration for the Jack Nicholson character in the 2006 Martin Scorsese film ""The Departed.""","Catherine Greig sold her share of a family home to her sister .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- An independent commission will be set up to examine Friday's terror attacks in which at least 76 people died, Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg announced Wednesday. Stoltenberg said he wants the commission to prepare an overview of both the bombing in Oslo, in which eight people died, and the mass shooting on Utoya Island, where 68 people attending a youth political camp lost their lives, and report back to Parliament within a year. He wants the commission to have a high degree of integrity, the prime minister said, and hopes its work will prevent any other such attack. ""Part of the work of the commission will be to look into the whole scale of the attack,"" he said. ""We've never had an attack on this scale since the Second World War, and it was targeted against a youth movement -- it's an attack against our nation, it's an attack against our democracy."" He said it is important for all those affected to have answers to all their questions about what happened. A suspect, Anders Behring Breivik, is in custody and has admitted carrying out the bombing and the shootings, his lawyer and a judge have said. He is being held in solitary confinement at Ila Prison, near Oslo, police said Wednesday. Police released the names Wednesday of 13 more of those killed in the twin attacks. Twelve of them died on Utoya Island, and the 13th was killed in the blast targeting government buildings in Oslo. The youngest among those killed on Utoya was 14-year-old Sharidyn Svebakk-Bohn. The other victims there were Silje Merete Fjellbu, 17; Hanne Balch Fjalestad, 43; Bano Abobakar Rashid, 18; Syvert Knudsen, 17; Diderik Aamodt Olsen, 19; Simon Saebo, 18; Synne Royneland, 18; Trond Berntsen, 51; Birgitte Smetbak, 15; Margrethe Boyum Kloven, 16; and Even Flugstad Malmedal, 18. Anne Lise Holter, 51, was named as having died in the Oslo bombing. Their names take the number of victims formally identified to 17. Police have said they will post an update at 6 p.m. every day until all the victims have been named. Their families will be notified first. In New York, a bell that was given to Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks rang out  in memory of all those killed in Norway as those names were released. The Bell of Hope in the churchyard of lower Manhattan's St. Paul's Chapel, a block from ground zero, was sounded by Norwegian Consul Aslaug Nygardat at midday local time, sending out four sets of five somber rings. Meanwhile, police are using a mini-submarine and a specially equipped boat to continue to search waters around Utoya Island, they said Wednesday. They have found personal effects and clothes, they said, adding that the depth of the water and the strength of the currents make it a challenging task. Police and local residents rescued about 300 people who jumped into the waters around the island during the shooting spree, they said Wednesday. Police carried out controlled explosions Tuesday and Wednesday at a farm associated with the suspect, they said. They took samples of bomb-making materials for analysis and detonated the rest because they were considered unstable and unsafe to transport, an Oslo police spokesman told CNN. Stoltenberg said earlier Wednesday that it was too early to look at changes to Norway's security measures, saying now is a ""time for mourning ... time for caring for those who have lost loved ones."" Norway will look at what it can learn from the tragedy after the police investigation, he said. Stoltenberg said he is proud of the way Norwegians responded to the massacres, with hundreds of thousands rallying in the streets of Oslo on Monday in memory of those killed. He rejected the idea that Norway lost its innocence in the attacks and said he hopes the country will grow stronger in its commitment to its core values. ""It's absolutely possible to have an open, democratic society and at the same time to have security measures and not to be naive,"" he said. Norway's security forces were aware of the danger of violent attacks and were prepared for them, he added. The country remains tense after the bombing and gun rampage. Police in Oslo shut part of the main train station Wednesday morning because of a suspicious package. They evacuated part of the station before declaring an all-clear later in the morning, state broadcaster NRK reported. And an unnamed police officer sparked a panic by accidentally distributing to some media an internal police memo saying they were searching for a man associated with the terror suspect. Police captured the man, who was not linked to Breivik, said police lawyer Per Thomas Omholt. ""There's a policeman someplace in Norway today having a bad day,"" he added, referring to the internal police memo inadvertently being sent out to the media. On Tuesday, Breivik's lawyer told reporters that his client was ""a little bit surprised"" that he was able to pull off the bombing and shooting rampage, for which authorities say he has claimed responsibility. The attorney, Geir Lippestad, said Breivik was surprised that his plan ""succeeded -- succeeded in his mind."" Lippestad said Breivik didn't expect to reach Utoya. Before the attacks, Breivik used drugs to keep himself strong and awake, Lippestad said. While he said it was too early to say whether Breivik will plead insanity, Lippestad added, ""This whole case indicates that he's insane."" During a closed court hearing Monday, the 32-year-old suspect said the attacks were necessary to prevent the ""colonization"" of Norway by Muslims, said Kim Heger, the presiding judge. Breivik accused the Labour Party of ""treason"" for promoting multiculturalism, Heger said. Lippestad said Breivik had told him that he was in touch with two terror cells in Norway and in contact with other cells abroad, but that he acted alone in carrying out the attack on Utoya and the Oslo bombing. Police have said they are investigating the claim that Breivik was in contact with other cells but have not confirmed that they exist. Prosecutors are considering charging Breivik with crimes against humanity, according to police. He is facing terror-related charges that carry a maximum 21-year sentence. Breivik appears to have written a 1,500-page manifesto that rants against Muslims and lays out meticulous plans to prepare for the attacks. In it, the author vilifies Stoltenberg and the Labour Party, accusing it of perpetuating ""cultural Marxist/multiculturalist ideals"" and indoctrinating youths with those ideals. The author accuses the Labour Party of embracing those ideals and allowing the ""Islamification of Europe."" CNN has not independently confirmed that Breivik is the author of the manifesto, which bears his name and says it is intended to be circulated among sympathizers. The writer rails against Muslims and their growing presence in Europe, and calls for a European civil war to overthrow governments, end multiculturalism and execute ""cultural Marxists.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- More than three weeks after seven California men went missing when the fishing vessel Erik sank in Mexico's Sea of Cortez, the families of the missing Americans are expressing anger with the U.S. and Mexican governments for not conducting a dive to find the sunken boat -- and possibly the bodies entombed beneath the sea. The sinking of the 115-foot sport fishing boat during a predawn storm on July 3 captured widespread attention because the 27 passengers were nearly all friends and acquaintances who fished on the Erik as an annual outing, some for as long as 15 years or so. All were from northern California, relatives said. Only five of them were first-timers on a five-night trip aboard the Erik, during which the sportsmen would venture deep into the sea aboard smaller pangas in search of yellowfin tuna and dorado, relatives said. Most of the 27 were Asian-American men from the San Francisco Bay area and nearby, relatives said. Those close ties heightened the depth of the tragedy, especially as U.S. and Mexican authorities spent nine days searching the vast expanse of the Sea of Cortez. In addition to the seven missing men, Leslie Yee, 63, died in the incident. Among the survivors, several were rescued from a Mexican beach. One person was rescued from a coastal island. The families have expressed frustration with the investigation. A State Department official said the U.S. Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are helping Mexican authorities with the probe. Still, the families say they are disturbed that there was apparently no mayday issued during the sinking of the Erik. Also, the boat apparently didn't carry a satellite tracking device that's often deployed when a boat is in distress, relatives say. In their social media and website campaign to attract public attention to their plight, the families have become so exasperated with the two governments' apparent reluctance to conduct a dive 200 feet beneath the sea that they are trying to raise money to execute a privately funded dive -- if they can raise enough funds on their ""Find Our Fathers"" website and if the Mexican government will allow the dive. The families are haunted by unanswered questions, their representatives say: Did the 16-member crew abandon ship without trying to help the passengers? Did the vessel have enough life preservers? Why did it take 16 hours before a search and rescue was launched? ""We don't want any other families to go through the pain we went through. This should not have happened at all,"" said May Lee of San Ramon, California. Her husband, Don, 62, an assistant parts manager at General Motors in nearby San Leandro, is among the seven missing. ""There's still a little bit of me that's hoping my husband is on some remote little island with some of his buddies,"" Lee told CNN on Tuesday. But the families have become demoralized. On Sunday, they will gather for the first time since the accident; at a hotel in northern California, Lee said. ""Some of them are very depressed, but I'm doing my darnedest to try to bring people together. I'm trying to give them as much hope as possible, to make sure we're hanging on,"" Lee said. In regular conference calls with the State Department as recently as Friday, the families have asked for the U.S. military to conduct a dive. Most recently, they have pressed U.S. officials to ask the governor of Baja California to fund a dive -- or at least to grant permission for the American families to carry out a private dive. The whereabouts of the sunken Erik are unknown, and the boat could be drifting somewhere on the sea bed, said Lee's daughter, Mandi Lee-Han, a 34-year-old preschool teacher. The boat capsized 60 miles south of San Felipe, Mexico, about two miles offshore, during the first night of the trip. A State Department official said the U.S. Department of Defense doesn't have the capability or equipment to do a deepwater dive and search for the fishing boat -- and it would have to pay for a private contract to do so. The official asked not to be identified, saying he wasn't authorized to speak to the media on the matter. The details of the Coast Guard's and NTSB's joining the Mexican investigation into the Erik are being worked out, the official told CNN Tuesday. ""When they were on the call,"" the official said about the families, ""we expressed condolences for the loss of life. Unfortunately, the DOD has limited capability to operate at that depth"" beneath the sea in a dive and search. ""When a U.S. citizen goes missing in a foreign country, the host government takes the lead in search and recovery efforts, often with the help of U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, who have the necessary experience and mandate,"" the official said. ""The Department of State will monitor such efforts and work to ensure that the host government does its utmost to locate the missing person, but lacks the capacity and authority to conduct search and rescue operations."" But the families aren't satisfied. ""It feels as though the Mexican navy is not really sharing with them what is happening,"" Lee-Han told CNN. The six other missing men are Russell Bautista of Penngrove, California; Shawn Chaddock of Petaluma, Calif.; Mark Dorland of Twain Harte, California; Gene Leong of Dublin, California; Brian Wong of Berkeley, California; and Albert Mein, 62, a retired AT&T manager, of Twain Harte. Mein was also Don Lee's brother-in-law, said May Lee, who works in the city hall of Fremont, California, overseeing a first-time homebuyer program and housing ordinances. Families have received messages on their Facebook page that local Mexicans have taken the initiative to search coastal islands for the missing seven Americans, posting reports on which islands they've searched. ""This grassroot effort is someone knows someone knows someone,"" said Lee-Han. She said the families are distressed to learn of what they describe as safety shortcomings aboard the Erik. ""Had we known there were all these problems in Mexico, we wouldn't have sent my father on this trip. We felt blindsided to some degree,"" Lee-Han said. ""What we're really trying to achieve here is to honor my father and all of the men that deserve to come back to their families,"" Lee-Han said. The families want the Erik found -- to see what safety problems the vessel may have had, relatives said. ""We most certainly don't want to harm the economy in Mexico, but at the same time, we want assurance from Mexico that if something is going to happen, that they're going to be responsible for whatever that may be,"" Lee-Han said. ""If there is an investigation that's going to take place, we would hope that the Mexican government would do a thorough investigation, and that would include a dive.""","The Erik, a Mexican sport fishing vessel, capsized in a storm July 3 in the Sea of Cortez .

"(CNN) -- Paris Saint Germain completed the signings of France internationals Jeremy Menez and Blaise Matuidi from Roma and Saint-Etienne respectively on Monday. The French club also announced the arrival of Serbia defender Milan Bisevac, who like Menez and Matuidi has joined on a three-year contract. Winger Menez spent three years in Italy after leaving Monaco, while defensive midfielder Matuidi has spent all his career in France, having started out at Troyes. The 24-year-old pair both made their debuts for Laurent Blanc's France team in 2010, with Menez gaining his first cap in a friendly against Norway in August and Matuidi making his international bow against Bosnia and Herzegovina in September. Bisevac, 27, has moved to the Parc des Princes from Valenciennes -- becoming the club's third acquisition since the takeover by a Qatari investment group was completed and former Inter Milan coach Leonardo was installed as sporting director in July. The trio followed former Lorient striker Kevin Gameiro -- also a recent France call-up -- and Rennes goalkeeper Nicolas Douchez in joining the PSG squad since the end of last season. Several players have departed since the club finished fourth in Ligue 1 last term, including experienced international midfielders Ludovic Giuly, who was released, and the retired Claude Makelele. Meanwhile, English Premier League club Aston Villa have agreed a fee for Wigan Athletic's Charles N'Zogbia. The France winger also made his international breakthrough in last year's clash with Norway, and the 25-year-old will now discuss personal terms with the Birmingham-based team. ""The club are pleased to confirm that we have agreed a fee with Wigan for French international winger Charles N'Zogbia,"" read a statement on Villa's official website. ""We will now discuss personal terms with the player and arrange a medical, with a view to completing the transfer later this week."" N'Zogbia joined Wigan from Newcastle United in 2009 and scored nine goals for the Latics last season as they avoided relegation from England's top division on the final day. If the transfer is completed, N'Zogbia will become Villa manager Alex McLeish's second signing of the offseason following the arrival of former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given from Manchester City. Switzerland under-21 midfielder Pajtim Kasami has joined English club Fulham from Italian side Palermo. Kasami, 19, was part of the Switzerland team which reached the final of last month's European Under-21 Championship, losing 2-0 to Spain, and has signed a four-year contract at Craven Cottage. Czech Republic under-21 international defender Ondrej Celustka, who also played at the tournament in Denmark, has joined Turkish first division side Trabzonspor. Celustka, 22, agreed a five-year-deal according to his former club Slavia Prague.","Paris Saint Germain confirm the signings of Jeremy Menez and Blaise Matuidi .

"(CNN) -- A second-half brace from striker Luis Suarez secured Uruguay a 2-0 win over Peru and a place in the 2011 Copa America final. The Liverpool forward scored in the 52nd and 57th minute to down Sergio Markarian's side, who were later reduced to 10 men. Uruguay, three-time winners of the tournament in its modern format, will now face either Venezuela, who have never lifted the continental competition, or 1979 champions Paraguay in Sunday's final. The second semifinal will take place on Wednesday at the Estadio Malvinas Argentinas in Mendoza. The deadlock was broken seven minutes after the break, when Peru goalkeeper Raul Fernandez could only parry Diego Forlan's shot and Suarez, 24, found the net from an acute angle. Copa America flops: Who is to blame? Victory was sealed for Oscar Tabarez's side when Suarez rushed onto a lofted ball up field before rounding Fernandez and rolling a low shot into the unguarded goal. Suarez now has three goals in the tournament, which leaves him level with Argentina's Sergio Aguero as the competition's top goal scorer. Peru's misery was complete on 68 minutes with the dismissal of their captain Juan Manuel Vargas for an elbow on defender Sebastian Coates. ""This victory is important,"" Uruguay right-back Alvaro Pereira told the tournament's official web site. ""I'm very happy, but we must keep our feet on the ground. This team has demonstrated an amazing hunger for glory and now we must think about what is and how we did from the beginning, when we thought all games were finals. ""There are always mistakes and we made mistakes [against Peru], but now we must correct them and hopefully we can win this cup.""

"San Angelo, Texas (CNN) -- Attorneys are scheduled to be in court Wednesday to argue a motion to suppress evidence, a day after jury selection in the sexual assault trial of polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs. It's unclear when the jury of 10 women and two men will hear opening statements. The jury selection Tuesday followed a full day of questioning. At one point, nearly half of 207 potential jurors raised their hands when asked by defense attorney Deric Walpole ""if you do not presume my client to be innocent."" Jeffs is charged with two counts of sexual assault on a child and one count of bigamy stemming from a 2008 raid on a ranch operated by his church. Authorities raided the Yearning for Zion ranch near Eldorado, Texas, and removed 400 children who they feared had been sexually abused. Some of the men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse and most of the children were later returned to their families. The ranch is operated by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, an offshoot sect of the mainstream Mormon Church. Walpole said he needs more time to present a defense, but Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said the defense has had sufficient time to prepare. District Judge Barbara Walther told the pool of potential jurors Monday that the trial could last two to three weeks. He is expected to be tried on the bigamy charge later. The FLDS splintered from the Mormon Church more than a century ago when Mormons renounced the practice of polygamy. Jeffs' church is believed to have about 10,000 followers. In Session's Jim Kyle, Lena Jakobsson and Beth Karas contributed to this report.","Jury is selected in Warren Jeffs case .

"London (CNN) -- The mother of a British girl whose murder spurred legislation to protect children says her phone was targeted by a private investigator working for the now-defunct tabloid that led the campaign for the new law. Sara Payne, whose slain daughter was the namesake of Sarah's Law, said Thursday that police have confirmed unspecified ""details"" on a list kept by private eye Glenn Mulcaire, one of the central figures in the scandal that took down the 168-year-old News of the World earlier this month. ""Sara is absolutely devastated by this news, we're all deeply disappointed and are just working to get her through it,"" a statement from her literary agency said Thursday. ""Sara will continue to work with the proper authorities regarding this matter. There will be a further statement in due course, but at this point in time, she (or we) can make no further comment."" Sarah's Law, which went into effect in 2008, allows parents to look up the records of convicted pedophiles. The News of the World led the crusade for the law for a decade and provided a mobile phone for Payne, the paper's ex-editor said Thursday. Payne wrote a column in the paper's defense in its final edition, arguing the News of the World ""has often been a force for good"" and pointing out that earlier claims that it had hacked her phone ""turned out to be untrue."" In Thursday's statement, Payne's representatives said police had informed her during an earlier probe of the allegations that Mulcaire did not have her information -- but a subsequent review found that he did. News International, the now-shuttered tabloid's corporate parent, said Thursday that it ""takes this matter very seriously and is deeply concerned like everyone."" ""As the facts are established, the Company and the independent Management and Standards Committee will take all appropriate actions, including cooperating fully with any potential criminal enquiries or civil proceedings which may arise,"" it said. And Rebekah Brooks, the former News of the World editor and News International chief who has been arrested as a result of the scandal, called the revelation ""abhorrent and particularly upsetting as Sara Payne is a dear friend."" ""The idea that anyone on the newspaper knew that Sara or the campaign team were targeted by Mr. Mulcaire is unthinkable,"" said Brooks, who touted the Sarah's Law campaign during her testimony to a House of Commons committee last week. ""It is imperative for Sara and the other victims of crime that these allegations are investigated and those culpable brought to justice."" News of the World provided Payne with a mobile phone for the past 11 years as part of the campaign for Sarah's Law, and ""The idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension,"" Brooks said in a statement regarding the allegation. Brooks was arrested and released on bail a week after the tabloid closed. She has not been charged with a crime, however, and her lawyer says she is not guilty of any offense. News International is the British arm of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which also owns the Fox television and cable networks and the New York Post in the United States. Murdoch and his son James also faced questions about the scandal last week from the same committee that grilled Brooks, and James Murdoch is among three witnesses who are being recalled for further questions Friday, a member of that panel, Tom Watson, told CNN. Thursday's disclosure was the latest twist in a scandal that has reverberated across the highest levels of the United Kingdom, featuring allegations of widespread phone-hacking, bribery of police officers by journalists and a bungled initial probe. Journalists at News of the World are accused of bribing police to get private details about people, including members of the royal family. The scandal has led to the arrests of several reporters and the resignations of the two top officers of London's Metropolitan Police Service. A British judge launched a new inquiry into the scandal Thursday, saying the probe would start ordering people to testify and hand over documents ""as soon as possible."" The judge, Brian Levenson, said the inquiry would try to deliver its initial report within a year, as instructed, despite the wide range of subjects it's supposed to cover. Prime Minister David Cameron announced the inquiry July 13 in response to public fury at the accusation that people working for News of the World illegally hacked into the phone of a missing British schoolgirl who was later found dead. And London's Metropolitan Police are running two investigations, one into the allegations of hacking and one into charges of police bribery.

"(Rolling Stone) -- One question loomed large before Friday's Alice in Chains concert at Madison Square Garden: How would new singer William Duvall measure up to Layne Staley, the band's original front man, who died in 2002? On ""Black Gives Way to Blue,"" the album Alice in Chains released last year with Duvall (ending a fourteen-year hiatus for the group), the new guy sounds remarkably like Staley. In concert, the similarity became almost eerie: The band kicked off its set by nailing the first three tracks from 1992's ""Dirt,"" (""Them Bones,"" ""Dam That River"" and ""Rain When I Die""), with Duvall recreating Staley's vocal lines with the same studiousness of guitarist Jerry Cantrell, who delivered his solos note-for-note. In that sense, Alice in Chains have changed: The show felt more like a recital than an exorcism, as it would have with Staley. Still, the crowd responded with cheers when Cantrell introduced ""Rooster"" by saying, ""It's been a long, strange trip, and I'm really glad it's still going."" It's going great, in fact, ""Black Gives Way to Blue"" has sold over half a million copies and produced three number one tracks on the Mainstream Rock chart. The band's not on the nostalgia circuit: They're arena rockers, and the polish they put on their music just comes with the territory. So do fans who know every word to the new songs, but shuffle off to buy a t-shirt during classic tracks like ""Down in a Hole"" and the ever-creepy ""Love, Hate, Love."" The set, though, cohered well, with the new acoustic song ""Your Decision"" sliding in alongside '94s ""No Excuses"" as if the two were written in the same era, and the ""Black Gives Way to Blue"" track ""Check My Brain"" just as clobbering as the four older tunes that came before it. Cantrell and company are playing to their strengths, and on Friday, they sounded about as strong as they ever have. Opening act Deftones, meanwhile, held their own, especially when they played more recent material, which blends dreamy atmospherics into the band's ultra-heavy attack. Frontman Chino Moreno, who has at times been criticized for sluggish performances, proved to be the night's most energetic performer, bounding across the stage and unleashing his primal screams. Before the show, Moreno told ""Rolling Stone"" that he has reevaluated his lifestyle since a 2008 car accident that left original Deftones bassist Chi Cheng in a semi-vegetative state. ""I watched some old videos of us, and I got choked up,"" he said. ""It made me think about a lot of the things I was doing and the way I was living, and gave me an appreciation for life. My new drug is sweating. Now I go onstage and I feel lighter on my feet -- I feel more agile."" The Deftones and Alice in Chains sets both had an undercurrent of loss. But by night's end, the overwhelming sense was of rebirth. Copyright © 2010 Rolling Stone.","Alice in Chains performed at Madison Square Garden on Friday .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The mayor of Afghanistan's restive southern city of Kandahar -- a resolute and proud public official who was regularly surrounded by armed guards and long under threat of death -- was slain Wednesday in a suicide bombing. Ghulam Haidar Hamidi, 65, was killed during a city hall meeting in the provincial capital when explosives detonated inside the turban of his attacker, according to Zalmai Ayoubi, a spokesman for the Kandahar governor's office. The assault comes several months after Hamidi told CNN in an interview that he didn't feel safe and that his life was in danger, most particularly from what he described as corrupt officials, but sloughed off family pleas to quit his position in Kandahar city. ""I was born in this province,"" Hamidi said in December, referring to Kandahar province. ""I eat from this province. I educate from this province. I study from this province. And I have good times in this province. And I owe this province. I have to work for this, my city."" 2010 interview with the Kandahar mayor . It is the latest in a series of recent high-profile assassinations claimed by the Taliban. But the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, cautioned against definitively pinning the attacks on the Taliban, despite the group's claims. ""It's not clear to me that this was a Taliban-conducted act,"" said Crocker, who pointed to a recent demonstration in front of the mayor's office over a ""road-building incident that resulted in the deaths of one or two young girls."" Crocker added that ""this could turn out to be a murder that didn't have anything to do with the Taliban."" Authorities say the mayor was leaving the meeting hall when the attack occurred, and Ayoubi said that ""it's not clear whether the suicide attack was from the children's relatives"" or from insurgents. One civilian was also injured in the attack. Interviewed by CNN's Nic Robertson, Hamidi had to have armed guards with him wherever he went. While he traveled in a bullet-proof vehicle, he was still vulnerable because of the threat of powerful roadside bombs. He cited dangers from many sources. ""Police warlords, drug dealers and power brokers are enemies of peace, enemies of security and development,"" he said in December. He said such people did ""very bad things"" and were destroying the city. He wondered how the city could be built and how peace could be brought to it, while the rebuilding process was slow and there were delays in ""locking in"" security gains. His plans have not been popular with everyone, and he blamed tribal differences. ""My way is we have to do (rebuilding) very quickly. We have to show to our people good service and quickly. These people are hungry for good service,"" he said. It is the second time in less than two weeks that a senior official was killed by suicide bombers who placed explosives in their turbans. The attack is also the latest in a string of killings across the country, and the most recent for a region that appears to be deadly for high-ranking officials. Two deputy mayors of Kandahar city have been gunned down by militants in the past year, according to the governor's office. Kandahar Police Chief Khan Mohammad Mujahid was also killed by a suicide bomber in April. Hamidi told CNN in December that the chief was a warlord. But perhaps the most high-profile attack occurred earlier this month when Kandahar's provincial council chief, Ahmed Wali Karzai -- the president's half-brother and an influential power broker in country's south -- was gunned down by a longtime bodyguard inside his home. The Taliban also claimed responsibility for that attack, though rumors soon swirled that his death could also have been the result of a murder over personal grievances. Global Public Square: What Wali Karzai's death teaches us . Still, Wali Karzai's assassination, Wednesday's attack and a list of others have highlighted security questions about who can be trusted in Afghanistan. During a remembrance ceremony for the president's half-brother at a Kandahar mosque two days after his death, a suicide bomber slipped into the building and killed six people and wounded 15 others. That bomber also placed explosives inside his turban. Within the next week, a key political adviser to the Afghan president and a Parliament member were gunned down in a home west of Kabul. The killings have taken place just as a security transfer to Afghan control and a NATO draw-down is under way. Speaking to the media for the first time since being formally sworn in, Crocker said the United States condemns Wednesday's attack ""in the strongest possible terms."" ""Our condolences are with his family and with the government and people of Afghanistan,"" he said. Crocker called the killing ""another indication of both the challenges that Afghanistan faces, but also the extraordinary resilience of the Afghan government and people."" Afghan President Hamid Karzai also condemned Wednesday's assassination, saying the attack was carried out by ""the enemies of peace."" The new U.S. ambassador described the recent attacks as ""horrific,"" but also said that if Taliban were responsible, it can be ""interpreted as a sign of significant organizational weakness on the part of the adversary."" A recent uptick in joint Afghan-NATO raids has killed many of the Taliban's senior and mid-level commanders across the southern and eastern provinces. ""The Taliban is now damaged to the point where they can no longer conduct large-scale operations,"" Crocker said. ""They've had to regroup and figure out what they can do."" The incidents came as NATO forces are beginning the first stage of a troop draw-down, which is expected to remove 10,000 soldiers from Afghanistan by the end of this year. The full drawdown is scheduled for the end of 2014. But Crocker on Wednesday gave indications of an American presence in Afghanistan well beyond the draw-down date. ""I think both we and the Afghans envision this as a very broad compact that will cover cooperation in a variety of fields"" beyond 2014, he said. ""Not only security, we're going to talk about educational, economic and commercial cooperation. ""The intention is to lay down the foundation ... for a strong, stable long-term relationship between our two countries.""

"UTTAR PRADESH, India (CNN) -- On World Population Day this year India's new health and welfare minister came out with an idea on how to tackle the population issue: Bring electricity to every Indian village so that people would watch television until late at night and therefore be too tired to make babies. Could the remote control be a birth control method? That statement raised eyebrows across this vast country -- but what are the realities and reactions from families who make up the second largest population in the world? At 80-plus years old Omar Mohammed has never heard of population control. He lives in India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh and has certainly done his part in contributing to India's burgeoning population. ""Now you see I have 24 children, 13 boys and 11 girls,"" Omar says. Omar believes only God can decide how many children you should have. He lifts his hands to the sky and says: ""This is His command. It's not my doing, it's His doing."" On the other hand there's the Arora family in the capital city of Delhi. They have two children. ""You can't even get enough water or electricity now. So its advisable that people have only two children and then they should stop having more kids."" mother Anjana Arora says. The Aroras know a little something about population issues; their daughter was given the official title of India's one billionth citizen when she was born in 2000. With family planning and free contraceptive programs the Indian government has long tried to encourage families to have only two children. Overall government statistics show the birth rate is coming down. The numbers show 14 of India's 35 states have reached the two child per family target. But the push is failing in other states, especially in villages and among the poor and illiterate where the fertility rate is as high as 3.5 children per woman. There are all kinds of reasons -- from the desire to continue having children until a son is born to lack of access to contraceptives. The government's concern is that a booming population will further test already scarce resources, greatly impact the environment, and make life even harder for the poor. According to the United Nations, India is home to 50 percent of the world's poor and on current projections, India will become the most populous country on earth sometime in the next 50 years, overtaking China. Upon hearing about the latest idea to use electricity and television to give people something else to do besides procreate, mom Anjana Arora scoffed. ""That's a stupid thing"" she said in English then switched to Hindi ""The only way to change people's mentality is through education."" But not everyone is writing the idea off. ""It's an idea that can really work."" says A.R. Nanda. Years ago Nanda helped draft some of India's population stabilization policies and he now runs the Population Foundation of India. He says while education and access to health care is paramount, electrifying villages is not a bad idea. ""It gives a message loud and clear that we need to do something for the people which is people-friendly and which in a way will keep their minds from taking irrational decisions about producing more babies,"" Nanda says. He says there are studies that prove it. One such survey done in 2006 by an Italian sexologist reveals couples with televisions in their bedrooms had sex half as much as those without it. That being said Omar Mohammed, the man with 24 children had a different take. ""After watching TV,"" he says, ""when we look at scintillating things we will probably want to make more children.""","An Indian idea to curb its population growth is raising eyebrows .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in New Hampshire bolstered their search operations Thursday in their search for a 11-year-old who a school nurse described as a ""young girl who is afraid and needs to be home."" Speaking on behalf of her community, Kirsten Lyons pleaded for the public's help in locating ""our beautiful Celina"" Cass, who was last seen Monday night in her northern New Hampshire home. ""Celina is a young girl who is afraid and needs to be home,"" Lyons told reporters on Thursday. ""(She) is missed very much."" About 100 investigators -- including FBI agents, New Hampshire and Vermont state police, local authorities and employees of the state's fish and game department -- went door-to-door Thursday in the small, tight-knit town of West Stewartstown, said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Kieran Ramsey. New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young noted authorities had received about 150 tips as of early Thursday evening, and were checking each one. Help has come from as far as Virginia -- including from FBI headquarters in Quantico -- Pennsylvania and New York, she added. ""It is our greatest hope that we find her and we bring her home safely,"" Young said Thursday, declining to field questions from reporters. Celina was last seen in her room, at her computer, at about 9 p.m. Monday night, according to police. WMUR reported that her parents told authorities the girl was gone when they went to wake her up Tuesday morning. Authorities have offered few further details on the case, nor has an Amber Alert been issued. Young said that investigators are looking at computer and phone records, trying to find clues. ""I can tell what we have not learned: And that is, where is Celina Cass now?"" Ramsey said. Celina's disappearance has rattled many in West Stewartstown, a town along the border with Vermont and Canada that has about 1,000 people, according to the state of New Hampshire. Friends and relatives have spent much of the past few days putting up posters and doing what they can to find the girl. ""We really want to know that she's OK, that she's safe,"" family friend Amanda Chapple told CNN Manchester affiliate WMUR. ""We want her home. We need her home."" Friends have set up a Facebook page, ""Missing Celina Cass,"" with one of the fliers serving as a profile picture. According to the flier, Celina is 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 95 pounds, with long brown hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a pink shirt, pink pullover and blue shorts. Lyons, who has been a nurse for 15 years at Celina's elementary school, said that the girl ""loves her family and is especially devoted to her sister."" ""Celina, we want you to know that the entire community -- your friends, your family -- are doing everything possible,"" Lyons said.","NEW: The search continues for Celina Cass, 11, in northern New Hampshire .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- No matter how many times he steers the 450-passenger Seabourn Sojourn through Norway's Lofoten Islands, captain Hamish Elliott eagerly anticipates his favorite point: the entrance to Trollfjord, a fairytale-like landscape with towering cliffs on either side. Scenic views are the most priceless part of an amenity-packed cruise experience. And, as savvy travelers seek more adventure opportunities, cruise lines are responding by charting a course to ever more beautiful-and remote-corners of the map. The world's most scenic cruises include the Kimberley, a gorgeous coastline of rugged red cliffs and white sands in northwestern Australia. In this outback, where the Indian Ocean meets the Timor Sea, remote islands proliferate, and rivers and inlets-accessible only by small ships-lead to isolated gorges, towering rock faces, and waterfalls. But big ship lines, too, are bringing passengers to ocean-accessible scenic wonders like Alaska's Inside Passage, where the roar of calving glaciers is best experienced from the vantage point of a ship's deck. It List: Best new hotels 2011 . Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but on the world's most scenic cruises, Mother Nature serves up views that will please even the most jaded traveler. Antarctica and the South Shetland Islands . The captain charts a course south from Argentina's tip to the ""Great White Continent,"" where wild beauty comes in the form of spectacular glaciers, giant white and blue icebergs, and snowcapped mountains.

"(RealSimple.com) -- A lack of intimacy caused their relationship to stagnate -- until a sex therapist helped them reconnect, both physically and emotionally. Elke Govertsen and Paul Donaldson Missoula, Missouri Married seven years . Sex with Paul had stopped being fun, says Elke, 35. ""In the middle of it, I'd make to-do lists in my head or interrupt to ask, 'Did you let the dog out?'"" Five years after their 2004 marriage, Elke and Paul found they could go weeks without being intimate -- something the couple, who had been inseparable since meeting in their 20s as camp counselors, would have once found unimaginable. For a time, they even joked to close friends that Elke wished she could read a book during intercourse. Around the middle of 2009, the situation stopped being funny, says Elke: ""We became too lazy to be romantic."" Their conversations ""were strictly utilitarian,"" she says. ""'Can you pick up the kids?' 'Did you pay that bill?' 'I need to be out of town on Saturday.'"" At first Elke blamed her husband's job for their eroded connection. His event-staging business requires him to travel extensively every summer to set up concert stages for popular musicians. During that time, Paul was home for only a few days every two weeks, leaving Elke to juggle her job as the publisher of a regional women's magazine and caring for their two sons, Boone, eight, and Dimitri, six. Elke felt lonesome when Paul was gone and resentful when he returned. Paul was equally miserable. ""All the hard work and late nights I was putting in were for nothing,"" he says. ""What good is success if you're unhappy?"" Knowing how much her sons missed their father, Elke encouraged Paul to spend what time he had at home with the boys. He often fell asleep on their bunk bed while reading stories and would stay there until morning, prompting the children to refer to the master bed as ""Mommy's bed."" Finally, during one late-night call in July 2009, Elke blurted out, ""This isn't working."" Paul felt the same way. But when Elke suggested they consider a separation, he balked. ""I couldn't imagine finding someone else who has Elke's rare blend of brains, grace, and beauty,"" says Paul. ""We had spent such a large portion of our lives growing and changing together."" But he admitted to feeling out of sync with her, too. The couple batted around the idea of seeing a therapist but dithered for months over finding one. Then, this past March, Elke's magazine held a contest for local business owners, and a clinical sexologist was chosen as the winner. ""I called to congratulate her -- and immediately made an appointment,"" says Elke. During that first session, the sex therapist pointed out that the pair had fallen into a trap common to many couples with young children. ""We kept waiting to feel less busy or less tired before we had sex, but that physical connection was the crucial thing we were missing,"" says Elke. Their therapist suggested they stop taking sex so seriously and try to flirt with each other again. Following her advice, Elke and Paul went separately to a local pub and pretended to meet for the first time. ""We felt ridiculous, but it was fun,"" says Elke. ""The role-playing got Paul and me laughing again."" They also changed their routine at home. To turn off her ""work brain,"" Elke moved her laptop out of the bedroom and into a home office. Instead of zoning out in front of the TV, the couple insisted on spending every night together from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. And when Elke complained that she still sometimes just wanted to sleep when she got into bed? The sexologist told her, ""Well, have sex somewhere else then."" Elke and Paul saw the therapist five more times over the next few months. ""Speaking candidly about our sex life was awkward, but it turned out to be essential,"" says Paul, 34. ""Sex really is a barometer of how much fun a couple can have together."" Once he and Elke began to relax and tease each other again, their physical relationship improved, and so did their emotional bond. By late spring, says Elke, ""we had become that couple who hold hands at parties."" Last summer, when Paul came home between concerts, Elke didn't foist him off on the kids. ""I need Paul's attention, too,"" she says. ""He and I have seen what it's like to have nearly separate lives, and it's important to us that we don't go back to being strangers.""

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- King Mohammed VI of Morocco declared sweeping constitutional reforms Friday that will boost the power of the prime minister and take away some of his own. Morocco's revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable, the parliament in Rabat more dynamic and will give the government greater powers, the 47-year-old king said in a nationally televised address. In the 30-minute speech, the sovereign described the draft constitution as ""a bedrock of the special Moroccan democratic development model -- a new historical bond between the throne and the people,"" while describing himself as a ""citizen king."" His actions followed a series of unprecedented protests not seen before in this North African modern Muslim country, where street protests are normally tolerated by the state, unlike in most other Arab countries. If the draft is ratified in a referendum set for July 1, its most radical change would be empowering voters to select a prime minister, thereby ending the longstanding practice in which the king has selected his own man for the job. The prime minister has tended to take his lead from the sovereign on key matters of state. If Moroccans back the draft, then the new prime minister would have new powers in decision-making and in day-to-day management -- relieving the king of a number of duties and aligning the style of management along the lines followed by some European Union countries. In an example of power sharing, the draft constitution empowers the prime minister to dissolve the House of Representatives, and stresses that the king shall consult him before announcing the dissolution of parliament. ""It specifies the conditions to be observed in each case in order to ensure the separation of powers as well as balance and cooperation between the branches,"" the king said. Friday's speech stems from a process that was first announced in March, after widespread civil unrest in the wake of the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. The king instructed a hand-picked committee to consult with political parties, trade unions and civil society groups on constitutional changes with a brief to trim the monarch's political powers and make the judiciary independent. But not all civil society groups were consulted, which sparked a wave of demonstrations across the kingdom from groups who feared they would be left out of the new plan. This move alone -- to grant real power to an elected prime minister -- could satisfy a number of demands from those members of society who have called for change. Confirming the full authority of the head of government over cabinet members, the draft constitution gives the prime minister the power to propose and dismiss cabinet members. ""This is good news as the power of the prime minister will be greater than before,"" commented Jihad Oufargi, a leader of Fevrier 20, Morocco's Facebook youth movement, after watching the speech in a crowded cafe in the center of Casablanca. ""Now the prime minister can change any minister who he sees is not doing his job properly. It was not like that before."" But King Mohammed will remain a key power-broker in the security, military and religious fields, according to the draft. For example, the king would still serve as ""the supreme commander of the armed forces"" and would not relinquish the power to appoint ambassadors and diplomats under the new constitution. Furthermore, the king would retain the power to dissolve parliament after consultations with the new constitutional court, half of whose members he would have appointed. The blueprint also takes the first steps toward making the judiciary independent -- a hot subject in Morocco, where judges are aligned to political parties and appointed by the king himself and so -- according to critics -- are seldom guided exclusively by law in their rulings. And the country will remain a Muslim state, though Moroccans in theory will be free to practice other faiths, since freedom of religion is supposed to be guaranteed under the constitution. Unlike other Arab countries, Morocco has a large Jewish community, whose members have been free to worship as they wish. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this story.","Moroccans will vote for the constitution in a referendum slated for July 1 .

"(CNN) -- Four members of an Arizona family have been charged with murder in the death of a 10-year-old girl whose body was discovered locked in a box outside her family's house. She had suffocated. The charges were filed Thursday, a day after Phoenix police arrested the four. Police released a statement saying the four relatives of Ame Deal had been entrusted with caring for her. The arrest came after police said they learned that the family routinely confined her inside the box when she misbehaved. John and Samantha Allen, both 23, were charged with first-degree murder after confessing they had locked Deal in the box July 12, the statement said. Cynthia Stoltzmann, 44, and Judith Deal, 62, were charged with child abuse and kidnapping after both admitted they had locked the girl in the box on previous occasions, it added. CNN was not able to reach Judith Deal's attorney; it was not immediately clear whether the remaining three have retained counsel. Stoltzmann was the victim's aunt and legal guardian, according to police spokesman Sgt. Trent Crump. Deal's and the Allens' relationship to the girl was not clear. ""When we initially responded to the scene, we filed it as an unknown death,"" Crump said. When first questioned, the family members told police that Deal had climbed into the box and suffocated while playing hide-and-seek, police said. That was the account Stoltzmann gave to CNN affiliate KNXV-TV on July 13, the day after family members reported finding the body. ""I don't break down well in front of other people, but when I'm by myself, I can lose it real easy,"" Stoltzmann said. ""She was an awesome hider, let me tell you. ... There were places she would squeeze into that I didn't think my dog could squeeze into."" But Crump said that, after investigating the incident, police came to believe the girl was killed. Crump said Thursday that the case has troubled even veteran detectives. ""This child died at the hands of those who were supposed to love and care for her. ... This case has turned the stomachs of some of our most seasoned detectives,"" he said. CNN's Chelsea Bailey contributed to this report.","Ame Deal's body was found in a box on July 12 .

"Washington (CNN) -- For the second time in a year, a top U.S. general has been cleared of allegations raised in a Rolling Stone article after an investigation by the Defense Department Inspector General. Lt. Gen. William Caldwell had been accused in the magazine of ordering an Army officer to conduct psychological operations to try to influence congressional members. Caldwell is in charge of all training in Afghanistan. The Department of Defense did not release the actual IG report. However, Defense spokeswoman Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins said the Inspector General found no evidence to support the article's claims. Robbins said Caldwell did not have a psychological operations unit in his command to do such work. Caldwell did, however, ask people on his staff to collect publicly available information about senators and congressmen who were coming to Afghanistan so he would be better informed during any meetings he might have with them. All the information they gathered came from Internet searches. The Rolling Stone article about Caldwell was written by Michael Hastings, the same reporter whose cover story about Gen. Stanley McChrystal cost the then-head of U.S. forces in Afghanistan his job. An IG probe also cleared McChrystal of the wrongdoing alleged in Rolling Stone. A Rolling Stone spokesman told CNN it stands by its reporting in both stories. Eric Bates questioned the idea of having the Defense Inspector General investigate two top Army generals. ""Letting the Pentagon investigate itself is not a good way to do the investigation,"" Bates said.","Magazine said Caldwell ordered psy ops on members of Congress .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Manchester United and Liverpool fans dream of the arrival of superstar players ahead of a new campaign, but it seems the spending power of both Englsih giants could be on the wane. Liverpool co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks took over the club in February 2007 . Both Rafa Benitez and Alex Ferguson have bemoaned the extravagance of the transfer market recently, with the United boss even going so far as to suggest he will not make anymore signings despite the transfer window remaining open until August 31. This despite having recently recouped a world record fee of $130m for the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo from Old Trafford. So what are the reasons behind the new culture of prudence at the top of the English Premier League? Well, it seems the cost of refinancing debt could significantly have curbed both clubs' spending power according to industry experts. Financial prudence will be the watchword for the majority of the English Premier League in the transfer market as clubs look to consolidate their financial position in a move that could see a shift of power in Europe to Spain's La Liga. It seems the Glazer family owners of United will not sanction anywhere near that amount of previous seasons for new players according to Professor Rogan Taylor at the University of Liverpool's Football Industry Group. How do you feel about United and Liverpool's debt situation? Sound Off below . The Americans' takeover of the Red Devils placed the club in $1.1 billion of debt, according to the holding companies' accounts of 2009; a situation that requires careful management. ""The refinancing at Manchester United is structured in a very complex way but ultimately the economic difficulties now mean that there will be a reduction in Alex Ferguson's transfer budget,"" he told CNN. ""Although some of the funds from the Ronaldo transfer will go back into the club's coffers there will be a tightening of the purse strings which will seriously impact on United's capacity to go after the top players. ""Certainly, Ferguson would have wanted a top-class replacement for Ronaldo but with the need to keep the debt in order and -- being unable to compete with Real Madrid and Manchester City -- the funds available and the pool of players from which they can sign is a lot smaller.""  Liverpool's situation is even more acute as American co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, through their company Kop Holdings, struggle to secure the finances to fund the club's proposed new stadium. A deal to refinance their $570m Royal Bank of Scotland loan appears to have been secured, but the long-term sustainability of the idea used to purchase Liverpool is serious under question. Professor Taylor added: ""The whole model on which Hicks and Gillett bought Liverpool is flawed and Rafael Benitez may have to sell Javier Mascherano or Xabi Alonso before he can go out and spend during the close season. ""Even then there is no certainty he will get the whole amount from the sale of either of those players back in the transfer kitty so it promises to be a difficult period for Liverpool as obviously expectation has been raised following last season's second-place finish. ""The need to refinance the debt remains key to the American owners remaining in control of the club so that will be their priority -- at the expense of matters on the pitch."" Jon Keen deputy chairman of the Football Supporters Federation, and an expert in the field of club governance and ownership, admitted the situation at both clubs will stir up further resentment among fans towards their owners. ""The current refinancing situation in the top-flight is like a financial house cards which could come crashing down at any time,"" he told CNN. ""We have already seen a situation unravel with the banking system which has angered a lot of people and something similar could well happen with football in the near future. ""Ultimately fans want to see money raised from sales of players either put back into the transfer pot or levied against their own costs of attending matches, not simply servicing huge amounts of debt as is the case with Manchester United and Liverpool at the moment. ""There needs to be a reality check about the way these clubs are operating. Certainly, I think the current economic climate will drastically reduce the spending power of clubs in the Premier League with the exception perhaps of Manchester City."" Of course, this contrasts with Spain's Real Madrid who have recently splashed almost $300m on Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema -- and are not finished yet if president Florentino Perez is to be believed. The construction magnate and his powerful board are able to wield influence with banks and allow Real to secure credit on favorable terms which, combined with a lucrative domestic television rights deal, puts them in a stronger financial position. Ultimately this appears to have precipitated a shift away from the English Premier League to La Liga for the world's best players as Spain becomes the preferred destination of choice. Whether Real can convert this into a challenge to the recent English domination of the UEFA Champions League on the pitch remains to be seen.","Refinancing has left Manchester United and Liverpool short of transfer funds .

"(CNN) -- India's Supreme Court received an appeal challenging the death sentence of the only surviving gunman from the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai, authorities said Friday. The plea filed on behalf of Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, was ""under process,"" Supreme Court registrar Pukhraj R. Bora said. It was sent in by the authorities of the Mumbai jail where Kasab is being held, Bora said. No date has yet been set for hearing, he added. A trial court handed down the death sentence last year for Kasab, a Pakistani, on charges of murder, conspiracy and waging war on India. Mumbai's High Court upheld his conviction and sentence in February this year. Convicts on death-row in India reserve the right to challenge the sentencing in the nation's Supreme Court. They can also file a mercy petition with the country's president if the Supreme Court also turns down their plea. During the November 2008 raids, 10 men attacked Mumbai landmarks, including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. More than 160 people died in the three-day coordinated attack. Kasab was photographed holding an assault weapon during the strikes. Indian forces killed nine suspects in the attack. India blamed the siege on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. The group denied responsibility. The Mumbai attack derailed a peace process between India and Pakistan for about 15 months. This year, the two nuclear neighbors nations announced resumption of their fully-fledged dialogue after a series of high-level meetings over the past one year. This week, the foreign ministers of the two countries pledged in New Delhi they will not let talks slide again because of thorny issues that made their countries bitter enemies.","A trial court handed down the death sentence last year for Kasab .

The lawsuit, originally filed in Manhattan federal court, alleges that Massport, United Airlines and security company Huntleigh USA were responsible for the security breaches that led to the death of Mark Bavis, 31, who was aboard United Flight 175 when it crashed into the World Trade Center's South Tower on September 11, 2001. Donald Migliori, an attorney for Bavis' family, said that Wednesday's dismissal of Massport -- the agency that owns and operates Boston Logan International Airport -- from the lawsuit was a disappointment, but that it narrows the case's focus around security on the airplane itself. ""It will be very targeted to United Airlines,"" he said of the lawsuit. ""United failed wholesale at keeping the American public safe."" The suit claims that security screeners at Logan International had trouble communicating in English, were unable to detect weapons such as the chemical spray Mace, and were operating under a general manager who was unaware of the al Qaeda terrorist threat. ""This was a tragic event and we are actively working to resolve this case,"" said United Airlines spokeswoman Megan McCarthy. From the start, the defendants have said they are not liable for the attacks. Massport filed a motion to dismiss in May, claiming that the Federal Aviation Administrations regulations for screening passengers and their baggage was the airline's responsibility, not the airport's. Massport was dismissed from the suit on Wednesday. ""The entire Logan airport community will forever carry in its heart the events of September 11, 2001,"" said Massport interim CEO David Mackey in a statement released after the dismissal. ""Our thoughts and prayers will always be with the victims of that tragic day and their families."" The Bavis family is one of 96 families who opted not to settle through the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, Migliori said. Their lawsuit, which is the last remaining suit brought by family members of 9/11 victims, was filed in 2002. ""There are lessons that can be learned from this and they want those lessons to be viewed and not buried,"" Migliori said. The trial is set to start November 7.

"(CNN)  -- Serena Williams produced a dominating performance to beat Maria Sharapova 6-1 6-3 to reach the semifinals of the WTA tournament in Stanford. The former world number one only returned to action last month after a lengthy layoff for injury and illness, but showed she is close to returning to the form that has brought her 13 grand slam titles. Williams, playing only her third tournament since winning Wimbledon in 2010, is currently ranked 169th in the world but made light work of the fifth-seeded Russian. ""I've just been trying my hardest and practicing and trying to get back in the top 100, Williams told the official WTA website. ""It's a little crazy, but hopefully..."" Sharapova has not beaten Williams since 2004 and admitted she had not been at her best. ""She was serving and returning quite powerfully, and I felt I was extremely late. I didn't have my timing today at all. ""Even when I had chances to change things around, I didn't do it."" Williams next faces big-hitting German Sabine Lisicki, who reached the semifinals at Wimbledon where she was beaten by runner-up Sharapova. Lisicki was a 7-6 2-6 6-2 winner over fifth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland in an earlier quarterfinal Friday. The other semifinal will be between third seed Marion Bartoli and improving eighth seed Dominika Cibulkova. France's Bartoli beat Japan's Ayumi Morita, who retired after trailing by a set.

"(CNN) -- American Robert Kendrick, ranked 105 in the world, has been banned from tennis for a year after testing positive for banned stimulant methylhexaneamine during May's French Open. The 31-year-old Kendrick, who lost in four sets to Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in the first round at Roland Garros, will not be able to return to action until May 22, 2012, after his ban was back-dated to the day of the offence. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) accepted Kendrick's claim that the stimulant was in a capsule he took to combat jetlag and was not intended to enhance his performance. What does the future hold for African tennis? However, the Tennis Anti-Doping Program makes it clear it is up to each individual player to ensure that no prohibited substance enters their body. An ITF statement confirmed: ""The ITF announce that Robert Kendrick has been found to have committed a Doping Offence under Article C.1 of the Tennis Anti-Doping Program. ""Mr Kendrick provided a sample on 22 May 2011 at the French Open held in Paris. That sample was sent to the WADA-accredited laboratory in Montreal, Canada for analysis, and was found to contain methylhexaneamine, a stimulant. ""Methylhexaneamine is a prohibited substance under section S6 of the 2010 WADA List of prohibited substances and is therefore also prohibited under the Tennis Anti-Doping Program. Mr Kendrick was therefore charged with an anti-doping rule violation under Article C.1 of the Program."" Kendrick, who reached a career-high of 69 in the world in 2009, has never won an ATP Tour title and never got past the second round of a grand slam event. However, he took the first two sets against Rafael Nadal in the second round at Wimbledon in 2006 before eventually going out. Meanwhile, in tennis action on Friday, three of the top four seeds are through to the semifinals of the Gstaad event in Switzerland. Top seed Nicolas Almagro joined fellow-Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, seeded four, and Russian third seed Mikhail Youzhny in the last four. However, second seed Stanislas Wawrinka disappointed the home fans by losing 6-3 6-2 to eighth seed Marcel Granollers, ensuring three Spaniards reached the semis. There was a major surprise in the WTA tournament in Stanford as top seed Victoria Azarenka was beaten 4-6 7-5 6-2 by New Zealand's Marina Erakovic.

"(CNN)  -- Michael Phelps claimed his third gold of the world swimming championships in Shanghai Saturday but then admitted he was short of peak fitness. The American superstar won the 100m butterfly ahead of Poland's Konrad Czerniak and compatriot Tyler McGill in 50.71 seconds. It was his sixth medal of the meet in his return to China where he took an unprecedented eight gold medal tally in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Phelps, who has been overshadowed by teammate Ryan Lochte in Shanghai, said he would be looking to improve with next year's Olympics in London his target. ""I'm not in the right shape physically.

"(CNN) -- Argentina have confirmed the appointment of Alejandro Sabella as their new national coach in succession to Sergio Batista. Batista, who had replaced Diego Maradona, was sacked after just eight months in charge following Argentina's Copa America quarterfinal exit to Uruguay earlier this month. That defeat heaped further pressure on Batista, who had been the subject of a media campaign to oust him following some controversial team selections. Batista sacked as Argentina coach . The 56-year-old Sabella was Daniel Passarella's assistant coach with both the Argentina and Uruguay national teams. He then followed Passarella as his number two with club sides Parma in Italy and Corinthians in Brazil. In March 2009, Sabella took his first senior coaching job with Argentine side Estudiantes and just four months later he led them to their first Copa Libertadores title in 39 years. Sabella, who won four caps for his country as a player that took in spells in England with both Leeds and Sheffield United, takes over the Argentina reins despite a previous agreement to coach UAE club side Al Jazira.","Argentina have appointed Alejandro Sabella as their new national coach .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic extended his winning run to 37 matches this year as he beat world No. 1 Rafael Nadal for the fourth successive time in the Rome Masters final on Sunday. Second seed Djokovic triumphed 6-4 6-4 in two hours 12 minutes, despite having seemed to be on his last legs when he overcame Andy Murray in a three-hour epic the previous evening. ""I'm amazed with way I'm playing, especially today given the circumstances and the conditon I was in,"" Djokovic said after the match. ""I was able to perform maybe my best play on clay and I beat the number one in the world on clay. It's amazing, I'm going to enjoy this victory, but then I need to get ready for Roland Garros."" Blog: Djokovic's dream year shows no sign of slowing . He was given more time to rest when the men's and women's finals were delayed due to rain in the Eternal City, and Djokovic appeared the fresher of the two players as he stormed to his seventh title this year after another gripping battle. Nadal had ensured he will be top seed for his French Open defense starting in little over a week by reaching the semis in the Italian capital, but it appears to be just a matter of time before Djokovic takes his mantle as the top player in men's tennis. The Serbian is doing to Nadal what the Spaniard did to Roger Federer a few years ago -- despite their age difference of a mere 11 and a half months, it looks to be a case of out with the old king and in with the new. Djkovic turns 24 next Sunday on the eve of his bid to win a first French Open. He ended Nadal's two-year winning run on clay in Madrid last weekend, and this time he thwarted the Mallorcan's bid for a sixth Rome title in seven years. His aim will now be to stop Nadal collecting a sixth French Open crown, and add to his own tally of two grand slams -- both coming in Australia, this year and in 2008. Djokovic also won the Rome title three years ago, but he was unable to maintain his momentum. In 2011, however, he is within striking distance of John McEnroe's record best start of 42 successive wins set in 1984. As in the match against Murray, the final at Foro Italico was a see-saw affair with both players breaking each other's serve unexpectedly often -- but Djokovic had the power and precision when it counted most. Serbian's No. 1 dream is fast becoming a reality . He took a 5-3 lead in the opening set after an uncharacteristic miscue by Nadal, then dropped his serve and promptly returned the favor to take a 1-0 lead. He went 2-0 up in the second set but Nadal, winner of a record 19 Masters Series titles, showed he is far from a spent force by battling back to level and keep it that way until the 10th game. Djokovic went 40-0 up but Nadal saved three match-points -- but the five-time Rome champion could not escape the fourth one and fell to just his second defeat in the tournament. ""He's doing amazing things, he's very tough mentally and physically,"" Nadal said. ""Every week he's winning matches, he's playing fantastically, he's doing a lot of things very well and he has a lot of confidence.""","World No. 2 Novak Djokovic five wins away from matching John McEnroe's record .

"(CNN) -- Costa Rica grabbed their first points of the 2011 Copa America on Thursday and left hosts Argentina facing elimination after a 2-0 victory over Bolivia. Second half goals from strike duo Josue Martinez and Joel Campbell secured three points for Costa Rica, while Bolivia endured a torrid evening after having two players dismissed. The result means two-time world champions Argentina must beat Ricardo La Volpe's Costa Rica in their final Group A match on Monday to avoid an early exit from the quadrennial tournament. The Central American side went ahead after 59 minutes, when the 21-year-old Martinez swept home after goalkeeper Carlos Arias had saved Heiner Mora's effort. Gustavo Quinteros' Bolivia were reduced to 10 men in the 71st minute, when defender Ronald Rivero blocked the 27-year-old Mora's goal-bound shot with his arm. Midfielder Allen Guevara Zuniga stepped up to take the resulting penalty but his effort was well saved by Arias, who also smothered the rebound. Despite Arias' heroics, Bolivia's task was made harder on 75 minutes when Walter Flores was given his marching orders for a strong challenge on Zuniga. Costa Rica sealed an important victory with 12 minutes remaining, when the lively Campbell ran clear to slide a shot beyond the helpless Arias. The team's players celebrated by holding up a shirt dedicated to Dennis Marshall, the former Costa Rica international who died in a car accident in June. Colombia still lead Group A on four points after their 0-0 draw against Argentina on Wednesday, with Costa Rica second on three points. Sergio Batista's Argentina are third on two points and must defeat Costa Rica in Cordoba to avoid an early exit from the competition.","Costa Rica grab their first points of the Copa America with a 2-0 win over Bolivia .

"(CNN) -- Team Leopard rider Wouter Weylandt of Belgium has been killed after a horror crash on the third stage of the Giro d'Italia. The 26-year-old crashed on the descent of the Bocco mountain, 25km from the finish of Monday's 173km stage between Reggio Emilia and Rapallo. Weylandt was attended to by medics, who administered cardiac massage following the incident, but he was pronounced dead from his injuries in the air ambulance on his way to hospital. Race officials later claimed the rider's left pedal got stuck in a wall at the side of the road, resulting in him being catapulted off his bike and thrown over 20 meters along the road. Team Leopard manager Brian Nygaard issued a statement on their official website, saying: ""Our teammate and friend Wouter Weylandt passed away after a crash on the third stage of the Giro d'Italia. ""The team is left in a state of shock and sadness and we send all our thoughts and deepest condolences to all the family and friends of Wouter. ""This is a difficult day for cycling and for our team, and we should all seek support and strength in the people close to us."" British sprinter Mark Cavendish, who held the race leader's pink jersey on Monday, wrote on his Twitter page: ""Things like this shouldn't happen. Absolutely sick to the stomach. My thoughts are with his family. RIP Wouter Weylandt."" And cycling legend Lance Armstrong also Tweeted: ""Just back from a run and got the news of Wouter Weylandt's death today in the Giro. I'm shocked and saddened. May he rest in peace."" Weylandt joined the newly-formed Leopard team this season, after spending his career with the Belgian Quick Step squad since turning professional in 2006. He enjoyed some success with Quick Step, notably taking a stage in the 2008 Vuelta Espana and ironically winning the same third stage of the 2010 Giro. Weylandt is the first cyclist to lose his life in a racing crash since Kazakhstan's Andrei Kivilev died of head injuries following an accident in the 2003 Paris-Nice race. In the 1995 Tour de France, Italian Fabio Casartelli, a teammate of Armstrong's at Motorola, was killed after crashing on the descent of the Porte d'Aspet in the Pyrenees. And in 1986, Italian Emilio Ravasio died several days after crashing on the first stage of the Giro d'Italia.","Team Leopard rider Wouter Weylandt of Belgium is killed after a horror crash .

"(CNN) -- A military officer trained in using psychological tactics to influence the emotions and actions of enemy troops told CNN Thursday her unit was ordered to used those skills to manipulate visiting lawmakers into securing more troops and funding for the war in Afghanistan. After a fellow officer questioned the legality of using ""psychological operations"" on elected U.S. officers, both received reprimands that could threaten their military careers, she said. ""We're not allowed to do that against any U.S. citizen, whether it is a congressman or my neighbor three doors down,"" said Texas National Guard Maj. Laural Levine. ""That is the first thing you are taught -- never target Americans, ever."" Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, is ordering an investigation into allegations made by the leader of Levine's unit, Lt. Col. Michael Holmes. The allegations are contained in a scathing Rolling Stone magazine report that was published Wednesday. Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan did not offer an outright denial of the story and said the probe would focus on ""determining the facts and circumstances raised"" in it. Holmes told the magazine that a military team at Afghanistan's Camp Eggers was ordered by Gen. William Caldwell, a three-star general in charge of training Afghan troops, to perform psychological operations on visiting VIPs over a four-month period last year. When the team devoted to what is known as information operations refused on grounds that it was illegal, it was subjected to a campaign of retaliation, the magazine said. ""My job in psy-ops is to play with people's heads, to get the enemy to behave the way we want them to behave,"" Holmes, the head of the ""information operations"" unit, told Rolling Stone reporter Michael Hastings, who also wrote an article last year that led to the dismissal of Gen. Stanley McChrystal. ""I'm prohibited from doing that to our own people,"" he said. ""When you ask me to try to use these skills on senators and congressmen, you're crossing a line."" Caldwell said in a statement to Rolling Stone that he ""categorically denies the assertion that the command used an Information Operations Cell to influence distinguished visitors."" But Holmes told the magazine he was reprimanded for refusing to carry out orders. Lapan, the Pentagon spokesman, said it was not necessarily improper for an information operations unit to create a dossier on visiting VIPs. ""It all depends on the circumstance and how it's done,"" he said. ""It's the actions, not just the assignment."" He said the investigation will determine whether any of those actions were illegal. Defense Secretary Robert Gates did not respond directly to the allegations contained in the Rolling Stone article. But his office issued a written statement. ""Secretary Gates is aware of the allegations in the Rolling Stone article and believes it is important to determine what the facts are,"" the statement read, ""so he fully supports General Petraeus's decision to investigate this matter before drawing any conclusions."" The Department of Defense describes the role of psychological operations as the following: ""Induce or reinforce foreign attitudes and behavior favorable to the U.S. or friendly nation objectives by planning and conducting operations to convey information to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals."" Federal law delineates the boundaries of such operations and states they ""will not target U.S. citizens at any time, in any location globally, or under any circumstances."" Holmes told Rolling Stone that Caldwell wanted the information operations team to provide a ""deeper analysis of pressure points we could use to leverage"" visiting lawmakers for increased funding. The magazine said that Caldwell's chief of staff also asked Holmes how the general could secretly manipulate the lawmakers without their knowledge. ""How do we get these guys to give us more people? What do I have to plant inside their heads?"" he said, according to Hastings' article. The report said that among those singled out in the campaign were Sens. John McCain, Joe Lieberman, Jack Reed, Al Franken and Carl Levin and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Reed told CNN's John King that he wasn't aware of any attempt by military personnel to manipulate him psychologically during trips to Afghanistan. The Democratic senator from Rhode Island said he's traveled to Afghanistan 11 times in within the past decade. ""I never experienced anything unusual last year in contrast with my other visits,"" said Reed. Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services, said he was ""confident the chain of command will review any allegation that information operations have been improperly used in Afghanistan.""","Officer speaks out about alleged order to use psychological manipulation on U.S. lawmakers .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- While Oscars go to those who do makeup, design costumes and mix sound for movies, those who crash cars, fall from tall buildings and blow things up can't get an Academy Award. Stunt coordinator Jack Gill has broken his back twice and his neck once during his 32-year career. He's hit a brick wall for the past 20 years trying to convince the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honor his profession. ""I think it's the acknowledgement that we all want for our efforts, because we are a big part of the movie-making industry and we see all of our other department heads getting these Oscars,"" Gill said Friday. An Academy committee meets on June 14 to again decide if a new Oscar category will be created for best stunt coordinator in a movie, which GoldDerby.com editor Tom O'Neil says is ""one of many areas the Oscars overlook and shouldn't."" When the Academy governors voted five years ago against a stunt Oscar, it appeared that the development of computer-generated imagery (CGI) would reduce demand for live stunt performers in movie production, Gill said. ""But in reality, the stunt person has evolved into a different type of stunt person,"" he said. ""He is now an integral part of the CGI aspect of it and we employ as many stunt people now as we did in the past."" This year's blockbuster ""Fast Five"" was noteworthy for its real stunts, said Gill, who worked on the action film as a stunt coordinator. ""We're going back to real physical stunts because the audience can now tell the difference and once an audience member can tell the difference between what's real and what's fake, it takes him out of the element and he doesn't believe that he's part of that action scene,"" he said. Gill, who started his career jumping ditches with the ""General Lee"" on TV's ""Dukes of Hazard,"" said the stunt business is getting more dangerous, not less. ""They want bigger and better,"" he said. ""They want to push the envelope. They want to get to a point to do things that nobody's ever seen before."" ""Fast Five"" required Gill to figure out how to pull a 10-ton bank vault with two cars. ""You're always doing things that tax your ability and you have to try to get in there and figure it all out and that's what a stunt coordinator does,"" he said. Even movies without crashes, blasts and falls need stunt coordinators to ""keep actors safe and to make sure that all the action works,"" he said. ""Avatar,"" which was completely computer-generated, had a stunt coordinator ""who designed all the action,"" Gill said. While quite a few of the leading actors do their own stunts, it is the stunt coordinator who must decide which stunts they can and can't do, he said. ""Because, as you know, if the actor gets hurt in any way, say he even breaks a finger, you're shut down for three months, and they look at you and say 'Why did you stick him in something where he can get hurt?' "" ""They're the ones that have to tell them, 'When you stand in this spot right now your life is in my hands and I'm telling you that you're safe in this spot, when the cars come sliding around the corner, they are not going to hit you. If you stand five feet over here, it's going to kill you,'"" Gill said. Despite the support of Hollywood A-listers such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Martin Scorsese, Jessica Lange and others, the politics are against the campaign for adding an Academy Award for best stunt coordinator, according to O'Neil, a journalist who has closely covered the issue. Pressure to keep the annual Oscar telecast entertaining and on schedule means there is a ""zero chance"" a best stunt Oscar will be handed out in the live ceremony, O'Neil predicted. Gill suggested, though, the clips of the nominated stunts would liven up the telecast. ""We don't even care if we're in the ceremony,"" Gill said. ""We just want to get that Oscar in our hands."" But the governors who represent the makeup, animated shorts and sound mixing peer groups would be unlikely to vote for awarding a competitive Oscar category off-air, O'Neil said. It would create a precedent that could pave the way for their Oscars to be taken out of the telecast's limelight, he said. ""It's the embedded and entrenched politics of this ancient group that is so hard to move,"" O'Neil said. The basic problem is that it would require addition of a stunt coordinators peer group to the 16 already existing, he said. It would add three governors to the Academy's board, which with nearly 50 now is ""just a nightmare,"" he said. There is ""very little payback"" for the Academy to add a stunt coordinator Oscar because ""these are unknown people to the viewers at home that watch the show, he said. Stunt people are not the only overlooked movie workers, O'Neil said. Voice actors don't have ""a shot in hell"" of winning a Oscar for their performances in blockbuster animated films, he said. Casting directors should also be honored, he said. Stunt actors are not completely snubbed by industry award shows, though. The Screen Actors Guild added a ""stunt ensemble"" SAG award. O'Neil said the category has been ""warmly received."" Gill, who was recently set on fire for an episode of TV's ""True Blood,"" said he's hoping the Academy governors will also see the light and see that ""without a stunt coordinator most of these big films would never be made."" ""I worked very hard on 'Fast Five' trying to make those physical stunts look real, and I think it paid off in what the audience came and saw, and I'd really like to be a part of the Oscar ceremony next year,"" he said.","Movie stunt coordinators want Oscar consideration for their work .

"(CNN) -- Anti-government demonstrations broke out Friday in Syria after weekly Muslim prayers, with activists reporting at least 34 deaths amid clashes between security forces and protesters. The Syria Human Rights Information Link told CNN that at least 11 people died in the western industrial city of Homs when security forces fired at crowds. For two months, Syria has been torn by street protests against political repression and a fierce security crackdown against demonstrators. The government's tough and violent actions toward marchers and its thousands of mass arrests have drawn widespread criticism. Demonstrations erupted after Friday prayers in Syrian cities, as they have for weeks. The United States has imposed sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other senior officials. On Thursday, President Barack Obama singled out Syria for criticism during his speech on the Middle East. A rights activist in Homs described thick black smoke hanging over the city as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets demanding al-Assad's ouster. According to the rights activist, the demonstrators gathered from several neighborhoods around Homs. The demonstrators chanted slogans calling for the release of political detainees and demanded freedom, equality and fundamental reforms, the activist said. As the crowd grew, security forces fired shots in the air and tried to disperse the gathering. When people refused to leave, security forces fired at the throngs, killing some and wounding others, the rights activist said. Despite the eruption of violence, demonstrators remained in the streets and chanted for the downfall of the regime. The Syrian Human Rights Information Link also said 13 died in Maarat al-Numan southwest of Aleppo. Two people were killed in the western city of Deir Alzour. At least one person was killed in the turbulent southern city of Daraa, and another died in Sanamen outside Daraa. One each died in the western coastal city of Latakia, the Damascus suburb of Darya and the western city of Hama. An additional three people died in the violence, but it was not immediately clear where, the rights group said. For the first time in about 25 days, the residents of Daraa heard the call for Friday prayers over mosques' speakers, according to activist Abdullah Abazeed. Previously, all mosques, shops, schools and other businesses had been closed and a strict curfew imposed due to the military siege in the town. But an activist there said the call to prayers was ""simply a show by the Syrian government to make it seem everything is OK and back to normal."" He said security forces surrounded four mosques Friday, but many residents shunned mosques in favor of praying in public squares. Arrests and attacks on civilian homes have continued, according to the activist. There were small protests in Daraa after Friday prayers, but no large demonstrations, he said. An eyewitness said demonstrators in the Damascus suburb of Qaboon marched toward the town's Grand Mosque, a demonstration that started with 800 people and grew to 3,000. As the group approached the mosque, a heavy security presence surrounded the demonstrators. Security personnel fired tear gas into the crowd and arrested protesters, the eyewitness said. Purported videos of protests surfaced on the Internet. The gatherings were said to be in Damascus, Homs, the city of Hama in the west and Abu Kamal in the far east of the country near Iraq. Demonstrators have blamed Syrian security for the violence, but the government has repeatedly pointed to unspecified ""armed groups"" for instigating the violence. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency on Friday said that ""armed groups exploited gatherings of citizens in Idlib and the outskirts of Homs"" and ""opened fire on civilians and police forces, which resulted in a number of deaths and injuries."" It said there were no confrontations or interference by security forces in other locations, where scores of people gathered in several provinces after Friday prayers and ""mostly"" dispersed after they chanted for freedom. Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday that people have been crossing into Lebanon from a turbulent Syrian region where violence has erupted recently. About 1,400 people have entered the Wadi Khaled and Tall Biri regions of Lebanon over the past week from the Syrian town of Tal Kalakh, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The number is ""in addition to those that have crossed since late April. Local authorities estimate that around 4,000 Syrians have crossed to Lebanon,"" the agency said in a written statement. ""Many of those who have crossed the border recently have come without any belongings, having fled what they say was heavy military bombardment of Tal Kalakh and surrounding areas,"" it said. ""Most have found shelter with relatives or host families, and some are residing temporarily in a school in Tall Biri."" Clashes between citizens and security forces have been reported for days in embattled Tal Kalakh, and witnesses there are reporting a strong security presence despite claims from the government of a troop pullout. In his address Thursday, Obama said Syrians have displayed ""courage in demanding a transition to democracy"" but the regime ""has chosen the path of murder and the mass arrests of its citizens."" ""President Assad now has a choice: He can lead that transition, or get out of the way,"" Obama said. ""The Syrian government must stop shooting demonstrators and allow peaceful protests, release political prisoners and stop unjust arrests, allow human rights monitors to have access to cities like Daraa and start a serious dialogue to advance a democratic transition. Otherwise, President Assad and his regime will continue to be challenged from within and isolated abroad."" Despite the international outcry against Syria, al-Assad does have support from Venezuela's president. Syria is ""the victim of a fascist onslaught,"" Chavez said Friday via Twitter. Chavez, a leftist president who has aligned himself with countries hostile to the United States, said that he spoke on Friday to al-Assad, whom he called a ""brother."" ""God help Syria,"" Chavez tweeted. The grass-roots demonstrations began in and around Daraa in mid-March and have spread to other cities such as Homs, Banias, Douma and Latakia. Most recently, there has been unrest in Tal Kalakh. A few dozen people have been killed recently in the town near the Lebanese border, human rights activists said. The Syrian state-run news agency Thursday quoted a military source as saying that army units started withdrawing from the town ""after accomplishing their mission of ending the state of security disorder caused by outlawed armed groups."" ""Life in the city is gradually going back to normal,"" the source was quoted as saying. But CNN spoke to one activist who said that ""army tanks pulled out of Tal Kalakh but continue to maintain their siege of the city."" Another witness said the military remains in the city center and in the suburbs and security forces are making arrests. As for the Syrian refugees filtering into Lebanon, that country's prime minister, Saad Hariri, asked the government's High Relief Committee last week to supervise and coordinate the work with the refugees. The U.N. refugee agency has helped distribute mattresses, blankets and food. ""The proactive role taken by the Lebanese authorities to ensure that new arrivals are assisted is encouraging,"" the U.N. agency said. ""Most of the people who have crossed the border in recent weeks are women and children,"" it said. ""In addition to their immediate need for food, shelter and medical help, they also need psycho-social support. The latter is being addressed by the Ministry of Social Affairs."" The agency said it has ""established a field presence in the north, working closely with the ministry to assess and provide needed protection interventions.""

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- Lebanon says it has approved the first ambassador to Beirut from Syria, the country which occupied Lebanon for decades. The families of Lebanese prisoners held in Syria protest outside the United Nations offices in Beirut last year. Lebanese President Michel Sleiman Tuesday formally accepted Ali Abed al-Karim Ali as the new Syrian ambassador to Lebanon, his office said. He did not present his credentials in person, and it is not clear when he will take office, Sleiman's office said. Syria and Lebanon established diplomatic ties in October 2008. Lebanon opened its first embassy in Damascus on March 16, when Charge d'Affaires Rami Mortada raised the Lebanese flag over the building in the Damascus neighborhood of Abu Remmaneh, which is also home to the U.S. Embassy, Lebanon's official news agency said. Michel El Khoury was named as Lebanon's ambassador to Syria earlier this year but has not filled his post yet, the president's office said. Syria maintained tens of thousands of troops in Lebanon from the 1970s until they were forced out by massive popular protests in 2005. The protests were a response to the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a huge car bombing in February of that year. Many Lebanese, as well as the United States, accused Syria of orchestrating the assassination of Hariri, an outspoken opponent of Syria. Damascus denies responsibility. The United Nations opened a tribunal in December 2005 to look into the killing. The United States is also exploring improved relations with Syria. Washington sent a high-level envoy to Damascus at the beginning of March, four years after it withdrew its ambassador over the killing of Hariri. The envoy, Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman, said the United States and Syria found a lot of ""common ground"" on which to cooperate in the Middle East, but warned to ""keep expectations in check"" as Washington and Damascus re-engage after several years of strained relations. CNN's Nada Husseini contributed to this report.","Lebanon approves first ambassador to Beirut from former occupier Syria .

"(CNN)  -- Championship leader Sebastian Vettel claimed pole position for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix as he edged out McLaren's Lewis Hamilton in final qualifying at the Hungaroring. Vettel, only fourth behind Hamilton in last weekend's German Grand Prix, re-asserted his season-long dominance with a time of one minute 19.815 seconds in his Red Bull in the last few moments of the session. Hamilton's McLaren teammate and 2009 world champion Jenson Button was third fastest and will occupy the second row with Felipe Massa of Ferrari. Massa, who suffered a near fatal crash in Hungary two years ago, outqualified his teammate and two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, who was fifth fastest. Mark Webber in the second Red Bull will join Alonso on the third row. Germans Nico Rosberg of Mercedes, Force India driver Adrian Sutil and Michael Schumacher in the second Mercedes were next best. Sauber's young Mexican star Sergio Perez completed the top ten. But this was all about defending champion Vettel, who was claiming the 23rd pole of his short but glittering F1 career and his eighth in 11 starts. By his standards below-par performances at the British Grand Prix won by Alonso and at the Nurburgring last week, had left some question marks hanging over him, but he answered in fine style. ""We changed a lot on the car overnight. The boys were working pretty hard and the boys didn't get much sleep but a result like this today is the best way to say thanks,"" he told the post-race press conference. ""I have the confidence back and I am feeling comfortable in the car. I am looking forward to tomorrow."" With overtaking at a premium at the circuit in Budapest, Vettel will be favorite to extend his 77-point championship lead over Webber, with Hamilton five further points adrift.","Sebastian Vettel takes pole for Hungarian Grand Prix in Budapest .

"(CNN) -- The United States have named former Germany captain Jurgen Klinsmann as their new national coach, just a day after sacking Bob Bradley. Bradley, who took over as coach in January 2007, was relieved of his duties on Thursday, and U.S. Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati confirmed in a statement on Friday that his replacement has already been appointed. ""Jurgen is a highly accomplished player and coach with the experience and knowledge to advance the program,"" said Gulati. Bradley sacked as United States national coach . ""He has had success in many different areas of the game and we look forward to the leadership he will provide on and off the field."" The 46-year-old Klinsmann, who will be formally introduced to the media on Monday, expressed his delight at his appointment. ""I'm excited about the challenge ahead. I am looking forward to bringing the team together for our upcoming match against Mexico on August 10th and starting on the road towards qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup."" Klinsmann, who led Germany to third place in the 2006 World Cup finals, already lives in California and has been linked with the position for some time. However, his reputation dipped slightly after taking over as Bayern Munich coach in 2008, losing his job after just a year in charge of the Bavarian giants. During his playing career, Klinsmann was respected as one of the greatest strikers of his era. He scored  232 goals in 516 games during a 17-year club career that took in spells with Bayern, Italian side Inter Milan and English club Tottenham Hotspur. He was also a member of the West Germany side that won the 1990 World Cup and the 1996 European Championship -- scoring 47 goals in 108 matches for his country.","Jurgen Klinsmann is named as coach of the United States national side .

"Minot, North Dakota (CNN) -- The bloated Souris River has crested at an historic high in Minot, North Dakota, but floodwaters likely will remain at or near their current level for several days, authorities said Sunday. ""At this point, the river has had its crest so far in Minot, but a number of locations downstream still have some high water yet to come,"" said Richard Kinney, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Bismarck. North Dakota. A crest is defined as the high point of the water during a flood before it begins to recede. A boil-water order, issued as a precaution on Saturday, remains in effect. And experts caution that although the water rose quickly -- flooding up to 4,000 homes to some degree -- it will be slow to recede. ""We did have a couple of close calls at the temporary dikes last night,"" Minot Mayor Curt Zimbelman told reporters Sunday. ""Both those areas have been repaired."" He reminded residents not to enter the evacuation zone. The river at Minot crested at 1,561.72 feet above sea level Sunday morning, said Kinney -- below earlier predictions but still almost 4 feet above an 1881 record. Water levels had fallen to 1,561.48 feet by Sunday night, Kinney said. Many residents of Minot, who evacuated ahead of the rising water, approached the water's edge on Sunday, hoping to catch a glimpse of their homes, said CNN's Jim Spellman. Most often, they are disappointed at the devastation they see, he said. Spellman said when he toured the hardest-hit area by boat, several residents gave him their addresses and asked him to check on their homes. Everyone was hoping their home might be the one that was spared, he said, but he had to bring back bad news. ""It's a somber feeling, sitting here,"" said resident Steve Knab. He recalled ""listening to the sirens go off, and they evacuated us, and coming back the next day and seeing this ... it's disheartening."" But, he said, ""we'll get there. We're healthy."" These personal struggles come as local, state and federal authorities rush to minimize the damage to property and maximize security and safety of residents. Three recovery centers will open on Monday -- two in Minot and one in Bismarck, Gov. Jack Dalrymple told reporters. Residents can visit the location to find out about assistance programs and ""meet with someone who is able to answer your questions directly,"" he said. But, he noted, it is not necessary for residents to visit the centers to register for disaster assistance, which can be done by telephone or online. He said he had toured the area, and it was ""sobering, to say the least."" A task force is being set up to immediately begin working on returning children to schools, whether those schools are restored or relocated. Evacuee Robin Taylor said residents have been helping one another. When her family had to evacuate in a hurry, neighbors on both sides pitched in, she said. Jim Sarroll has lived in Minot his entire life. He has sandbagged his home, located just outside the evacuation zone, with the help of neighbors, and said Sunday it is dry for now. He is, however, very concerned about the water. ""I flushed my toilet this morning, and the water was red,"" he said. Still, he said he is able to see the positives when neighbors, relatives and friends bond to get through a disaster the best they can. The Souris flows through the center of Minot, a city of about 36,000. About a third of the city's population is under evacuation orders. About 900 National Guard soldiers and about 100 airmen from Minot Air Force Base are assisting in the Minot area, authorities said. Minot officials told residents Saturday that tap water should be boiled for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms. The focal point in Minot continues to be the Broadway Bridge, a critical north-south route through town. Officials have been working round-the-clock to prevent the river from inundating nearby routes, all part of larger efforts aimed at preventing Minot from effectively being split in half by the flooding. ""It's really important that (Broadway) bridge stays open,"" said Cecily Fong, spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. Republican Rep. Rick Berg said he had been in touch with officials in Washington -- which has authorized FEMA to grant assistance -- and expressed optimism that the government will work well with residents to overcome the challenges. ""You're seeing people at the highest levels working together, putting politics behind them,"" said North Dakota's lone congressman. Berg, though, cautioned that the ""marathon"" was far from over. For instance, water levels near the Broadway Bridge were still expected to remain around 1,561 feet through Tuesday -- with a slow drop over the coming week. And the worst is yet to come for other North Dakota cities and towns. In Sawyer, ""we'll be approaching peak levels over next 24 hours,"" meteorologist Patrick Ayd of the National Weather Service in Bismarck said early Sunday morning. Water levels in Velva are expected to peak Monday or Tuesday. The situation prompted the evacuation Saturday of Sawyer's 350 residents as water from the Souris River began to slosh up a main street through town, according to the U.S. Corps of Engineers. Ken and Janelle Herslip's house -- less than a mile from the Souris -- was one of those flooded on Sunday. Even though a crew of more than three dozen friends and family helped them evacuate on Monday -- scouring the house for everything that wasn't attached to the walls -- Ken Herslip said Saturday his wife was still devastated. ""We've had many homes over our life, and she finally got the house of her dreams,"" he said. ""She is absolutely devastated, bawling all the time."" Herslip, who built the house, isn't so busted up. No one was hurt, and they can build again, he said. Still, he said, ""it will never be the same.""

"(CNN) -- Bou Meng walks into a big open room, sits down on the floor and points to a number, which is stenciled on the wall. Number 13. It was his prison number and the spot on the floor where he says he was shackled in Cambodia's infamous Tuol Sleng Prison. The prisoners who entered were often killed. Bou was one of the few who survived the torture, starvation and executions routine when the Khmer Rouge were in power. Led by the late Pol Pot, the regime was responsible for the deaths of millions of ordinary Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that was eventually halted in 1979 by invading Vietnamese forces. But the memories of this dark chapter continue to haunt victims such as Bou more than 30 years later, as four surviving members of the Khmer leadership, including Pol Pot's ""number two,"" prepare to stand trial for their alleged role in the genocide. In 1975, the Khmer Rouge ordered everyone out of the capital Phnom Penh and other cities in Cambodia to work in the countryside as farm laborers. Bou, an artist, was sent off to work in the paddy fields. One day in 1977, he was told he was being moved away from farm life. ""I was supposed to move to the Royal University of Fine Art, but instead I was brought to S-21, also known as Tuol Sleng Prison,"" he says. ""The first thing I saw was the people that had long hair to the waist. Their eyes were sunken and their bodies were only bone and skin. I was so shocked."" It didn't take long before the plight of the others became his fate. He was tortured mercilessly. But art saved his life. The prison officials asked him if he could draw Brother Number 1, the man known as Pol Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge. Bou said yes. They were impressed by his work, so he began working on a huge portrait that would take him months. The Khmer Rouge government was then wreaking havoc on the entire country. It is said to be responsible for about 1.7 million deaths, roughly a quarter of the population back them. Its aim was to create a Communist utopia but instead the regime forced Cambodians into a living hell. City dwellers were marched into the countryside and forced to work as farm laborers. Those already living in rural Cambodia were expected to produce enough food for the country while teaching farming to those who had never done it before. Currency was abolished, and anyone with an education was considered a threat. No one was allowed modern medicine and the country isolated itself trying to become completely self-sufficient. The results were disastrous: People died of starvation and disease as soldiers tortured and killed anyone suspected of being disloyal. Eventually, everyone, including the soldiers, became a target due to the leadership's paranoia. Tan Than was a soldier, although he says he never had a gun and was only given farming tools. By 1978, a year before the fall of the Khmer Rouge, Tan and all the soldiers in his brigade were arrested and sent to work on an airport. Tan said he saw people dying of hunger as they tried to build the airport and the road leading up to it. As he walks up to the airport road where he once toiled, he suddenly begins to sob. It is the first time he has been back since 1979. ""I cry when I remember the people and my older brother who they separated from me."" He has not seen his older brother since. He doesn't even know where the body is buried. Tan himself was supposed to be one of the tens of thousands of bodies dumped in what have become known as the ""killing fields"" located all over Cambodia. But Tan and a few others in his brigade fought back the day they were supposed to die. He says when the soldiers came into the building where all 292 members of his brigade had been taken it was clear they meant to exterminate them. ""When we got inside they were shouting you betrayed (us). You are Vietnamese. You are American. You are CIA. Then they came inside the house and we fought back."" He and 12 others escaped. Tan's sister-in-law Long Saoda worked at the same site where the soldiers were taken and watched in horror the fate of hundreds of unarmed people. ""I saw a truck full of people. ... I hid and tried to listen more. Then I saw them (soldiers) holding guns. They were hiding in the forests on both sides with guns,"" she recalls. ""Shoot, shoot, shoot, bang, bang, bang,"" Long re-enacts with her hands. ""...When the people got off the truck they tied their hands and then they walked the people to the hole they had dug, then they killed all those people and then the second truck came."" Eventually, she says, a tractor would cover the hole with dirt even if the people inside it were still alive. There are still two noticeable indentations where villagers point out you can still see the gravesites in their village. Similar scenes were repeated around the country. More than three decades on and the story is not yet over. The remaining leaders of the regime are finally being put on trial. The indictment, more than 350 pages long, includes accusations of everything from genocide to torture to war crimes. Case number 002 is the second and perhaps most important case being heard by the United Nations-backed tribunal in Cambodia. ""They are alleged to be responsible for the whole policy, which ended up in crimes being conducted all over this country,"" says Lars Olsen, the spokesman for the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. ""It is probably one of the first times since the Nuremburg trials (the case against the Nazis that began in 1945) where the whole remaining political leadership ... have been put on trial together. Cambodians have been waiting for more than 30 years for someone to be held accountable for what happened during the years the Khmer Rouge was in power."" Tens of thousands of people from around Cambodia are expected to come watch the trial, even if for only one day. As for Long Saoda, Tan Than and Bou Meng, they hope the trial provides the answer to one question that has haunted them all these years: Why would a government treat its own people this way?

"(CNN) -- Sergio Aguero hopes to take Manchester City to another level, the Argentina striker revealed after completing his big-money move to the English club on Thursday. Aguero, 23, has agreed a five-year contract after leaving Spanish club Atletico Madrid for an undisclosed fee. British media reported that the Premier League club had beaten the record paid by a British team of £32.5 million ($53 million) that City splashed out for Brazil forward Robinho in 2008. Aguero, the son-in-law of Argentine football legend Diego Maradona, will reportedly earn a weekly wage of £200,000 ($327,000). He joins a club seeking to build on last season, when Roberto Mancini's team finished third to qualify for the European Champions League for the first time and also won the FA Cup to end a 35-year wait for a trophy. Aguero reveals City move on Twitter . ""I think we are a team that in the future will be fighting every year to win major trophies, and let's hope that it's quite a few major trophies,"" Aguero told City's website. Aguero, who played for Argentina at this month's Copa America in his homeland along with new clubmate Carlos Tevez, has missed City's pre-season tour of the United States. ""I don't think I'll have too many problems settling into the team,"" he said. ""Once I'm out on the field I will get to know my way round, but I can't say that for sure because I have not even made my debut yet. But I'm sure everything will be fine. I'm going to be relaxed about it."" Nicknamed ""Kun"" after a Japanese cartoon character, he follows former Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure and Valencia winger David Silva in moving to the Manchester side from Spain in the past year. ""They are great players, and yes I have played against them in the past but now they are here, in a team which right now is one of the biggest teams in England,"" he said. ""My style has always been to fight to the death for every ball, and give 100% in every game: be concentrated to the maximum in everything I do; movement, running off the ball, winning the ball back and scoring goals. I'm not a player who can do everything, but I still have plenty to offer."" With club captain Tevez unable to secure his desired exit from the club after his former team Corinthians of Brazil pulled out of a planned deal, it leaves City with a surplus of strikers -- and a ballooning wage bill despite the imminent financial fair play rules for European clubs. Togo international Emmanuel Adebayor and Welshman Craig Bellamy are expected to leave ahead of the August 31 transfer deadline, with both out of first-team contention after being loaned out last season. City won all three matches in the U.S. and now head to Ireland for the Dublin Super Cup, playing an Irish XI on Saturday and Italian club Inter Milan on Sunday. Mancini's men take on local rivals Manchester United in the Community Shield on August 7, the traditional season curtain-raiser before the club's opening Premier League match at home to promoted Swansea on August 15. Meanwhile, Spanish club Malaga have continued to spend heavily ahead of the new season with a deal for Villarreal winger Santi Cazorla worth a reported €22 million ($31 million) . The Spain international, 26, has agreed a five-year contract to join a big influx of players at La Rosaleda. His fee eclipsed the previous club record of €10 million paid for France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan, while coach Manuel Pellegrini has also brought in veteran Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, Diego Buonanotte, Isco, Nacho Monreal, Joris Mathijsen, Sergio Sanchez and Joaquin.","Sergio Aguero completes move to Manchester City from Atletico Madrid .

"VALENCIA, Spain -- Defending America's Cup champions Alinghi of Switzerland have revealed they are to start building a multihull yacht for their duel against American challengers Oracle. Alinghi have promised a ""big beast of a boat"" when they take on American challengers Oracle. Alinghi's design team coordinator Grant Simmer said: ""We are looking at building a big beast of a boat and the loads are off the scale compared to most of the boats we've been involved with."" ""Obviously from a naval architecture point of view this is an extremely fast and exciting boat,"" he told a news conference in the Spanish port of Valencia which hosted the last America's Cup in July 2007. Earlier this month, San Francisco-based Oracle, backed by Silicon Valley maverick Larry Ellison, announced that construction of a multihull yacht for its America's Cup challenge was ""well underway"" on the US Pacific coast. While Alinghi, which is backed by biotech tycoon Ernesto Bertarelli, has not yet started to build its boat, the Swiss team have been training on both catamarans and trimarans in Europe. The two sides will be facing off in a duel, or Deed of Gift Match, for the 33rd America's Cup because they failed to reach an agreement on the rules for a traditional regatta involving several teams. The New York Supreme Court, the trustee of the Deed of Gift, the 1887 document which details the complex rules of the America's Cup, is expected to rule shortly on the next date for yachting's showpiece event. Alinghi prefer May 2009 while Oracle want October 2008. The Swiss team argues it cannot build a competitive multihull yacht by October in order to adequately defend their crown for what would be their third straight title. ""Today we have a way forward,"" said Alinghi team skipper Brad Butterworth. ""Ernesto has committed to building this multi-hull and as long as we can get the pending issues resolved by the New York courts, including a race date in 2009, we'll be sailing in a huge multi-hull against Oracle,"" he added. Butterworth said Alinghi had retained most of the sailors that it had during the last America's Cup ""with a slight downsize"" and had recruited people with experience in a multi-hull challenge. Alinghi retained the America's Cup by beating Team New Zealand in a hugely successful event in Valencia in July 2007. The 33rd America's Cup had originally been scheduled to be held in Valencia in July 2009 as a traditional regatta involving several teams. But organisers indefinately postponed the event in November because of the legal wrangling betwen Oracle and Alinghi over the rules of the event.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The new commander of U.S. forces in Korea stood just feet away from North Korean soldiers on Friday. Just one day after Gen. James D. Thurman was installed as the head of the United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command/United States Forces Korea, he visited the border between North and South Korea. That area, better known as the DMZ, or Demilitarized Zone, is somewhat ironically named, considering it may be one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world. As Thurman arrived at the truce village of Panmunjom and entered the building where the armistice that ended the Korean War was signed in 1953, North Korean soldiers, some with binoculars, watched through the windows from their side of the border, behind a simple concrete threshold. They also took photographs -- the usual North Korean response to VIPs visiting the area. Standing at an observation post overlooking North Korea, the general said, ""I thought it very important that I come to the DMZ to observe first-hand the readiness levels and the training and the leadership of the ROK (Republic of Korea) military and U.S. participation so I have a better understanding of the mission."" U.S. and South Korean soldiers briefed Thurman on the security situation there. When asked to characterize the current North Korean threat, Thurman said it was important ""to maintain the deterrence"" but also expressed hope the threat would diminish some day. Despite the armistice signing, North and South Korea have been technically at war since 1950, and recent attempts at peace talks have repeatedly failed. Tensions have remained high on the peninsula since North Korea carried out two attacks on the South last year, killing 50 South Koreans.","Gen. James D.

"(CNN) -- A preliminary 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Monday morning off the coast of Papua New Guinea, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake struck around 9:39 a.m. and was centered 131 kilometers (81 miles) east of Wewak, which is on the northern coast of the Pacific nation, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Its depth was reported at 16 kilometers (9 miles). The Japan Meteorological Agency -- which had an identical measure for the quake's strength -- noted on its website that ""there is a very small possibility of a destructive local tsunami"" as a result. It said any tsunami likely would not be over half a meter (20 inches) high. ""However at some coasts, particularly near the epicenter, high tsunamis may arrive (larger) than our estimation,"" the agency said on its website. But within about two hours after the quake struck, the Japanese agency reported there were no such warnings or advisories still in effect.

"(CNN) -- English club Chelsea have complained to the Malaysian Football Association about alleged racist abuse of Israel captain Yossi Benayoun last week. The Premier League side said constant jeers directed at the 31-year-old midfielder during a pre-season match against a Malaysian XI were anti-Semitic. Malaysia, a mainly Muslim country, does not recognize the state of Israel. The Malaysian FA has yet to respond to the allegations. ""Such behavior is offensive, totally unacceptable and has no place in football,"" said a statement on Chelsea's website. Blog: Team spirit makes Uruguay a World Cup contender . ""The club did not make representations at the time as it was initially unclear as to the nature of the abuse Yossi received, as several players from both teams experienced similar treatment, sometimes louder and longer. ""However, having taken time to consider the issue fully, it has become apparent that a formal complaint was necessary. ""Our stay in Malaysia was, on the whole, a very positive experience for all the team traveling on the pre-season tour. It is a shame, therefore, that the behavior of a minority of supporters is also a memory we take away."" The match in Kuala Lumpur on July 21 was watched by almost 85,000 spectators, with Chelsea winning 1-0 thanks to a second-half own-goal from the home team. The 2010-11 Premier League runners-up will conclude the pre-season tour against English rivals Aston Villa in Hong Kong's Asia Trophy on July 30, before another friendly away to Scottish champions Rangers on August 6.

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez appeared on state television with a shaved head Monday, telling viewers it is a sign that his cancer treatment is working. He referred to it as his ""new look,"" using an English fashion phrase to describe his appearance. ""Chemotherapy attacks the whole body, and the act of hair falling out is normal, and it also shows that the treatment is effective,"" he said. Chavez said his cancer treatment is going well and he is ""advancing optimally."" In June, Chavez announced that doctors had removed a cancerous tumor from his body, but the Venezuelan leader has not specified what type of cancer. He traveled to Cuba last month for about a week of chemotherapy. Chavez was jovial as he spoke to members of his Cabinet for more than an hour after swearing in several new government ministers. He mocked critics for widespread speculation about his illness. ""They keep speculating without any scientific basis,"" he said. Chavez also reiterated his support for Moammar Gadhafi, reading a letter he recently received from the embattled Libyan leader. In the letter, Gadhafi said he was praying for Chavez's health and decried what he called a global conspiracy against Libya. Chavez and Gadhafi have a close relationship, having bonded partly over shared opposition to the United States' global influence. In 2009, a new football stadium in Libya was named after Chavez. The Venezuelan leader has spoken out numerous times since unrest erupted in Libya, accusing the United States and other countries of blowing the situation out of proportion to justify an invasion. On Monday, Chavez applauded with his Cabinet ministers as they chanted, ""Long live Moammar Gadhafi."" ""Brother, we are with you and we are with Libya,"" he said, saluting toward the camera.","NEW: Chavez reiterates his support for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York City grand jury indicted an alleged drug kingpin and three suspected associates Monday after authorities seized a stash of methamphetamine and heroin valued at more than $6.5 million, the Drug Enforcement Administration said. Jose Mauro Mota and his alleged co-conspirators were arrested in July after a ""record-breaking"" seizure, officials said. Authorities said they found 51 pounds of crystal methamphetamine, valued at $4.8 million. Also seized was 11 pounds of heroin, valued at about $1.75 million. ""This is one of the largest and highest-purity methamphetamine seizures with the end destination - -the Big Apple,"" John P. Gilbride, head of the DEA's New York field division, said in a prepared statement. ""The New York Drug Enforcement Task Force and the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor worked collaboratively in order to disrupt this multi-drug smuggling organization and arrest those responsible for dealing meth in and around NYC."" Mota faces multiple drug possession charges, authorities said. His alleged associates also face drug charges. Mota, Deivis Rafael Ceballos, Cesar Primitivo Lara and Romedi Lara-Serrano were arrested on July 3 on Interstate 95, near a service area in Ridgefield, New Jersey, following a two-week investigation, authorities said in a news release. Authorities said they learned of the alleged drug shipment as agents used a court-authorized wiretap to listen to Mota's phone conversations. Authorities then followed the shipment, which originated in Mexico, through Texas and then across country, the news release said. The drugs were being transferred from a tractor-trailer to a car at the time of the seizure, it said. Mota and Ceballos also face charges under New York's kingpin statute dealing with operating as a major trafficker, the news release said. This is the only felony narcotics charge in New York that comes with a possible life sentence.","$6.5 million worth of methamphetamine and heroin is seized in July .

"(Mashable)  -- The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) has teamed up with Facebook to reduce the amount of hate speech and anti-gay bullying that goes on around the internet. Members of the gay community reached out to GLAAD recently when a Facebook page created to remember the victims of anti-gay bullying who had committed suicide was flooded with hateful, violent and derogatory remarks and images. Fortunately, GLAAD was able to work with Facebook to remove the content, and this organization's work with Facebook has just begun. Recently, tragic events that included the use of technology to shame and harass a college student, Tyler Clementi, because of his sexual preference led to Clementi's suicide. And this sad news came just a couple weeks after 15-year-old Billy Lucas committed suicide after being tormented by other young people about his sexuality. Since then, celebrities, organizations and social media users have taken to the web to spread words of encouragement and discourage bullying behavior. Columnist Dan Savage launched a YouTube channel, ""It Gets Better,"" and many celebrities have spoken out on YouTube about LGBT issues and teen bullying. MTV Networks even rolled out an iPhone app to help combat bullying. Still, the largest online destination for many beleaguered gay teens and young adults is Facebook -- ironically, one of the platforms where hate speech, though prohibited, is unfortunately still carried out. Today, Facebook announced that they're making new efforts to respond quickly when hateful speech violates the terms of service and needs to be removed. And this isn't just routine TOS policing, either. Facebook Public Policy Communications Manager Andrew Noyes wrote in an email today that Facebook ""intends to work closely with GLAAD and other LGBT organizations on future initiatives."" Stay tuned for more information on how exactly the social network plans to support LGBT teens and the larger gay community. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- American James Blake overturned a one-set deficit to defeat Ernests Gulbis 5-7 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 in the opening round of the Atlanta Tennis Championships. Gulbis, 22, served for the match with a 5-4 advantage in the second set, but Blake, a former world number four, fought back to force a tie break and eventually take the match. Blake, currently 91st in the rankings, secured a decisive service break when leading 3-2 in final set, and will now face compatriot John Isner in the second round. Isner, who finished runner-up at the 2010 event, is seeded third at the tournament and was therefore not required to play in the first round.

"(CNN) -- A Florida judge on Monday signed amended court documents mandating that Casey Anthony return to Orlando to serve a year of probation stemming from her check fraud conviction. ""From my reading of this, she should be reporting to probation in Orlando probably within 72 hours,"" Orange County Circuit Judge Stan Strickland said in signing the documents, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The action came after an apparent misunderstanding in the case. Anthony pleaded guilty in January 2010 to felony check fraud charges, admitting she stole a checkbook from her friend Amy Huizenga and wrote five checks totaling $644.25. At the time, defense attorney Jose Baez asked that Anthony be given credit for time served and be placed on probation. Strickland apparently intended for the supervised probation to begin after Anthony's release from custody, said Randy Means, spokesman for the Orange County State Attorney's Office. But the order signed by Strickland at the time seemed to indicate it was to run while she was in custody awaiting trial on murder charges in the 2008 death of her daughter Caylee. Cheney Mason, one of Anthony's defense attorneys, said his client's legal team is working to ""set aside and vacate the order."" He said the order claims Baez and Anthony were present Monday for a hearing -- something Mason said ""did not happen."" ""From what I can see, it is a fraud,"" Mason said. ""We will be addressing that with all due speed and with aggression as the law, procedures, ethics and judicial canons will allow."" Mason said Anthony's lawyers will seek to ""disqualify Mr. Strickland for the second time."" The judge had been presiding over her murder trial until April 2010, when he recused himself after the defense accused him of being a ""self-aggrandizing media hound"" who is biased against Anthony. Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. took over, and stayed in that position through the trial. A jury acquitted Anthony of charges in Caylee's death. The 25-year-old Orlando woman was released from jail July 17. Her whereabouts since then have been unknown. Means said prosecutors were surprised to receive a letter from the probation office indicating Anthony's probation was completed. He said there was a miscommunication between what Strickland said at the sentencing and what the court clerk understood. The clerk thought the probation and Anthony's time in custody were to run concurrently. The documents were amended Monday to add the words ""upon release"" to Anthony's sentencing documents, the Sentinel said. Orange County prosecutors will not take a position on whether Anthony should serve probation, Means said, adding the issue is between Strickland, Perry, the probation department and the clerk's office. ""We don't think we have jurisdiction. The court is the sentencer, and if they think it (sentencing) was not followed, they can do something,"" Means said. ""Our position is to leave it up to the court."" A Department of Corrections spokeswoman told CNN affiliate WESH that Anthony must report to Orange County within 72 hours. ""We are moving forward to make sure she is following the judge's orders,"" Gretl Plessinger said. Anthony's defense attorneys may challenge the move and claim Anthony should not have to serve probation because she already did while in custody, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Means said the defense would have a strong argument to have the amended sentencing order declared invalid on grounds of double jeopardy. It would be unconstitutional to have Anthony serve another year of probation if technically she already served it while in jail, he said. Perry has indicated he wants to meet with officials from the Department of Corrections to go over what happened and ""make corrections."" Means said he does not know what that means, and knew of no pending hearings regarding the issue. At Anthony's sentencing on the check fraud charges, she was ordered to have no contact with Huizenga, who testified against her during her murder trial. At her sentencing for the check fraud charges last year, Anthony said, ""I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm sorry for what I did. I take complete and full responsibility for my actions, and I'd like to apologize to Amy. I wish I'd been a better friend.""

"(CNN) -- The ongoing labor dispute between the professional basketball players' union and the league ratcheted up a notch Tuesday as the NBA said it filed a lawsuit against the players. The NBA also announced Tuesday that it has filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board along with the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in New York. These moves have one NBA expert saying the labor struggle is putting the start of the NBA season in danger. ""This is just one more log on the fire that is threatening to consume the whole NBA season,"" said David Aldridge, a reporter for NBA TV. ""I am not optimistic that season will start on time."" Both actions are reactions to recent threats by the players' union that were hampering negotiations, the NBA said in a statement. ""These claims were filed in an effort to eliminate the use of impermissible pressure tactics by the union which are impeding the parties' ability to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement,"" said NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer Adam Silver. The NBA began a lockout of its players in early July. NBA Commissioner David Stern has argued that the last season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners and there was a need for some cost-cutting help from players. The league lost as much as $300 million in the 2010-11 season, Stern has said. One of the battles has been around the owners not agreeing to the players union's call for an average $7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal. The current salary average is about $5 million. Aldridge said other big issues are a fight over whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap and a move by the owners to get a bigger share of revenues. The last work stoppage occurred in 1998.","The NBA has also filed an unfair labor charge with the National Labor Relations Board .

"(CNN) -- The medical examiner's office in Concord, New Hampshire, will conduct an autopsy Tuesday on the body of Celina Cass to determine how the 11-year-old girl died. Celina's body was found by divers searching the Connecticut River on Monday -- one week after she was last seen. ""We have brought Celina home, not the way we wanted to bring her home,"" New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said. The girl's father, Adam Laro, said he was heartbroken and grasping for answers after hearing the news. ""I can't see why somebody would want to do that to my daughter,"" he told CNN Tuesday. ""That's the thing that puzzles me."" Young said that the case -- which had been considered a ""missing persons"" case -- is now being investigated as a ""suspicious death."" No one has been arrested or named publicly as a suspect in what is now a criminal investigation. ""Based on what we have seen visually, we are treating it as suspicious,"" she said. Celina's body was found around 10:30 a.m. Monday by divers from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department near a hydroelectric plant outside West Stewartstown, New Hampshire, according to the attorney general's office. Young described it as a ""routine search because of the proximity to (Celina's) home,"" about one-quarter mile away. The site is also near the Canadian border, where the Connecticut River forms the border between New Hampshire and Vermont. The discovery came a day after Laro -- who was in the hospital when Celina went missing -- said that he was like others ""wondering where my daughter is"" and hoping she was safe. On Tuesday, the father thanked all those authorities and residents who had put their time and effort into finding Celina. ""Celina was a very good girl. She was very kind, considerate. I guess you could say an everyday child that loved ... being in life,"" he said. Laro also spoke to HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" show on Monday night. He said then that his memories of his daughter are ""beautiful, beautiful, just a wonderful-hearted person."" ""I ... can't believe what's gone on,"" Laro said on Monday. ""I have no fingers to point ... I hope there will be some answers, that's what I'm asking."" Celina was last seen in her room, at her computer, around 9 p.m. July 25, according to police. CNN affiliate WMUR reported that her parents told authorities the girl was gone when they went to wake her up. Since then, local, state and federal investigators had searched for her and for clues about her whereabouts ""by air, by land, by water,"" Young said Sunday evening. Young said on Monday that authorities, including FBI agents, had received nearly 500 tips prior to finding the girl's body. She described investigators' focus Monday around Celina's home as ""routine,"" after being asked about yellow crime tape there and the removal of a vehicle. The aim is to ""determine if we have any evidence"" in places around where the girl was last seen alive. Young added that the discovery of the girl's body should help authorities ""hone the investigation, so you will (still) see searches conducted in different areas."" Celina's father said that he had not spoken with his ex-wife, who lived in the house with the girl's stepfather of about a year, since the girl went missing. He described his ex-wife as a ""great mother,"" and added he had positive interaction with the stepfather. ""(It was) a household that supposedly gave her great love, that's what she always told me,"" Laro said Monday. CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","The father of Celina Cass, 11, describes her as a ""very good girl ... kind, considerate""

"(CNN) -- Exceptional drought conditions spread across nearly 12% of the United States last month, a record number that shows the widespread impact of the dry weather conditions, according to a report released Monday. Officials at the National Drought Mitigation Center said the July percentage is the highest recorded level of drought since the monitor began documenting conditions 12 years ago. More than 40% of states faced abnormal dryness or drought, a report released by the center said. The report tracks and ranks weather conditions from ""abnormal dryness"" to ""exceptional drought."" A drought is considered ""exceptional"" when the situation extends beyond what ""could be considered part of normal risk management,"" according to the center's website. Dry weather has been pervasive throughout the South but particularly difficult for Texas, which hoped to find relief in Tropical Storm Don. The storm made landfall Friday between Corpus Christi and Brownsville but quickly fizzled into a tropical depression, disappointing residents looking for a break. ""We were desperately hoping for some rain that didn't come,"" said Tiffany Sunday, a resident of the Corpus Christi area. Texas is suffering from the third-worst drought in the state's history, according to state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples. More than 2 million acres of Texas farmland have been abandoned due to the exceptional dryness, Staples said last week. He added that the weather has been ""excruciatingly painful"" for producers and affected the harvest of cotton, corn and grain throughout the state. Seven other states are at least 85% abnormally dry. They are New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas and Florida. The drought monitor said affected states may see improvement from rain in the coming weeks. ""Whenever there is a lot of moisture in a short period of time, the potential exists for rapid improvement. ... But while that possibility exists, it won't necessarily mean the end of drought in those areas,"" said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center. CNN's Chelsea Bailey and Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report.","Report: Almost 12% of the United States struggles with ""exceptional drought"" conditions .

"(CNN) -- Nearly seven months after being shot in the head -- an injury that would have killed most people -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords returned to Congress in a dramatic and emotional appearance to vote on the debt ceiling compromise. She walked onto the House floor to thunderous applause and left in a glow of bipartisan cheer, sparking an almost immediate discussion of a possible re-election bid. But what is in Giffords' future wasn't immediately clear. Despite her astounding recovery, she still needed help to make sure she wouldn't fall, Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted on CNN's ""American Morning."" And she has much rehabilitation work ahead of her, he said. Giffords' spokesman, C.J. Karamargin, said his boss has not decided whether she will seek re-election. ""Congresswoman Giffords is focused on her recovery,"" he said. Giffords' close friend Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that preparations are nevertheless under way should Giffords decide to make such a decision. ""We're certainly getting her ready to make sure that she can run for re-election at the point that they're ready to decide on that,"" said Wasserman Shultz, D-Florida. Giffords was shot in the left side of the head during a session with constituents outside a Tucson supermarket in January. Six people died in the attack, including a member of Giffords' congressional staff. Initial reports suggested that she was among the fatalities. Instead, she survived the initial trauma and surgeries and set out on a recovery that colleagues, friends and medical experts have described as remarkable. She was released from the Tucson hospital in January, traveling to Houston for rehabilitation. In May, she attended her Navy officer husband's space shuttle launch. Weeks later, she was released from the rehab hospital. And Monday night, she returned to Congress. ""The #Capitol looks beautiful and I am honored to be at work tonight,"" Giffords tweeted Monday. Her unexpected appearance on the House floor ignited a long wave of applause and greetings from House members in both parties. Her hair still close-cropped from brain surgery to repair the bullet's damage, Giffords waved at applauding colleagues with her left hand and mouthed the words ""Thank you"" repeatedly before casting her vote in favor of the debt ceiling proprosal. ""It's been very tough, very, very, very hard-edged, and as Gabby came in and people realized, it was just this wave of recognition, and the House erupted,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""It was electrifying."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney described Giffords' appearance as a ""great moment."" ""It was a powerful moment and a wonderful moment, obviously, because of her courage, her bravery, her unbelievable perseverance, and, through her recovery, her commitment to service,"" he said. ""But also it was a testament to ... how something like that can bring everyone together after such a contentious debate."" Daniel Hernandez, the former Giffords intern who rushed to her side moments after she was shot, said he was excited to see her recovery. ""It was absolutely amazing to be able to see her going back to doing what she's always loved, which is representing her constituents,"" Hernandez said. Giffords' husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, said in a Twitter post Tuesday that he was lucky to be married to the congresswoman. ""Gabby, I'm so proud of you for everything you have done & continue to do to make this country a better place,"" he wrote. That Giffords is still alive, much less able to return to Congress, is remarkable, Gupta said. About three-quarters of people with such wounds don't survive, he said. It's clear that Giffords is suffering weakness to the right side of her body that would be expected from an injury to the left side of the brain, Gupta said. She did not move her right arm and required assistance standing. He said Giffords still has a lot of rehabilitation work to do. Most patients in her situation peak in their recovery after 12 to 18 months. For now, Giffords probably has difficulty expressing herself -- a typical trait for people with traumatic brain injuries -- and may have difficulty recalling words. That could be difficult for a politician in a re-election campaign, but were Giffords to run again, it would probably not be an ordinary campaign. As her appearance in the House showed, she has built up an enormous amount of goodwill as the survivor of a shooting rampage. ""Pity the soul that runs against her,"" one supporter wrote Tuesday morning on Twitter.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a joint resolution Tuesday supporting the limited use of U.S. military force in Libya for one year -- a move sought by the Obama administration as it works to win clear congressional backing of the controversial North African mission. The resolution, which explicitly rejects any introduction of U.S. ground troops, was approved 14-5. It now advances to the full Democratic-controlled Senate. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives rejected a similar measure last Friday, but also voted down a bill restricting U.S. involvement in the conflict. Deep congressional divisions over the mission stem from, among other things, a belief among some representatives and senators on both sides of the aisle that the White House has violated the War Powers Resolution. Passed in 1973, the law gives a president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war, followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities. The combined 90-day period ended last week without any congressional expression of support for America's role in the NATO-led operation. Administration officials have repeatedly asserted that the U.S. role in Libya does not meet the law's definition of hostilities. The president reportedly overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in declining to seek congressional authorization. Earlier Tuesday, top State Department legal adviser Harold Koh told members of the committee that the War Powers law does not apply to the U.S. military intervention. Koh argued that the measure is not applicable because the U.S. role in the mission is limited in terms of its scope, means, exposure of U.S. forces, and chances of escalation. ""The precedent here has been narrowly drawn,"" Koh asserted. Republicans on the committee did not agree. Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, the committee's top Republican, said President Barack Obama's decision to intervene without explicit congressional backing was a ""fundamental failure of leadership that placed expedience"" before constitutional responsibility. ""There was no good reason why President Obama should have failed to seek authorization"" by Congress, he added. There has been a ""lack of constitutional discipline"" in this case. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, told Koh he was ""sticking a stick in the eyes of Congress,"" ""I think you've undermined the integrity of the War Powers Act,"" Corker said. By refusing to take a tougher stance against the administration's actions, senators are ""making ourselves irrelevant"" to debates over military action, he added. Koh told committee members that a ""major structural flaw"" of the law is that, absent explicit congressional approval, it requires an automatic termination of military engagements after 60 days. ""You cannot run these things by autopilot,"" he said. Executive and legislative branch judgment is required in each instance, he asserted. Koh, along with both Democrats and Republicans, acknowledged the act could be updated to reflect technological advances such as unmanned predator drone strikes -- something unheard of when the law was passed during the Vietnam War. The ""language needs further clarification,"" said Kerry, the chairman of the committee. But for Congress to now ""pull the rug out from under (America's NATO allies) would have far-reaching consequences,"" he warned. The allied military effort in Libya, which has formal United Nations support, was launched to protect civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. Western leaders have made clear that they believe the mission cannot be successfully completed without Gadhafi's ouster. The White House has promised not to use U.S. ground troops, but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has nevertheless been mounting over several weeks.","NEW: The Foreign Relations Committee backs limited U.S. military action in Libya .

"BARCELONA (Reuters) -- ""Galactic Suite"", the first hotel planned in space, expects to open for business in 2012 and would allow guests to travel around the world in 80 minutes. An artist's impression of the Galactic Suite, where guests would enjoy views of the Earth during their three-day stay . Its Barcelona-based architects say the space hotel will be the most expensive in the galaxy, costing $4 million for a three-day stay. During that time guests would see the sun rise 15 times a day and use Velcro suits to crawl around their pod rooms by sticking themselves to the walls like Spiderman. Company director Xavier Claramunt says the three-bedroom boutique hotel's joined-up pod structure, which makes it look like a model of molecules, was dictated by the fact that each pod room had to fit inside a rocket to be taken into space. ""It's the bathrooms in zero gravity that are the biggest challenge,"" says Claramunt. ""How to accommodate the more intimate activities of the guests is not easy."" But they may have solved the issue of how to take a shower in weightlessness -- the guests will enter a spa room in which bubbles of water will float around. When guests are not admiring the view from their portholes they will take part in scientific experiments on space travel. Galactic Suite began as a hobby for former aerospace engineer Claramunt, until a space enthusiast decided to make the science fiction fantasy a reality by fronting most of the $3 billion needed to build the hotel. An American company intent on colonizing Mars, which sees Galaxy Suite as a first step, has since come on board, and private investors from Japan, the United States and the United Arab Emirates are in talks. Plenty rich enough . If Claramunt is secretive about the identity of his generous backer, he is more forthcoming about the custom he can expect. ""We have calculated that there are 40,000 people in the world who could afford to stay at the hotel. Whether they will want to spend money on going into space, we just don't know."" Four million dollars might be a lot to spend on a holiday, but those in the nascent space tourism industry say hoteliers have been slow on the uptake because no one thought the cost of space travel would come down as quickly as it has. Galactic Suite said the price included not only three nights in space. Guests also get eight weeks of intensive training at a James Bond-style space camp on a tropical island. ""There is fear associated with going into space,"" said Claramunt. ""That's why the shuttle rocket will remain fixed to the space hotel for the duration of the guests' stay, so they know they can get home again.""

"New York (CNN) -- The MSNBC news network suspended political analyst Mark Halperin on Thursday after the Time magazine columnist used a four-letter insult to describe President Barack Obama. Halperin quickly apologized for the remarks, in which he told fellow panelists on the ""Morning Joe"" program that Obama was ""kind of a d--k"" for blasting Republican lawmakers during a Wednesday news conference. He had been told the program was on a seven-second delay before he delivered his assessment. He delivered what he called ""an absolute apology, heartfelt"" to Obama and to viewers after a commercial break and remained on the air. But MSNBC called his comments ""completely inappropriate and unacceptable"" and said Halperin would be suspended indefinitely from his on-air role. Halperin said he agreed with the move. ""My remark was unacceptable, and I deeply regret it,"" he said. Halperin is an editor at large at Time and the senior political analyst for the magazine, which like CNN is a subsidiary of the media conglomerate Time Warner. The magazine responded to reporters' inquiries by pointing them to Halperin's verbal and written apologies. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the remark ""inappropriate"" and said he had ""expressed that sentiment to executives at the network."" ""I have no comment on that, whatever action that network -- any network, any newspaper, whatever -- might take, because that's not for us to decide,"" Carney told reporters. The exchange began as the show's host, former Republican Rep. Joe Scarborough, questioned whether Obama's Wednesday criticism of GOP leaders was merely ""showmanship"" ahead of tough negotiations over raising the federal debt ceiling. ""Are we on the seven-second delay today?"" Halperin asked. ""I wanted to characterize how I thought the president behaved."" He was told the delay was in place, with co-host Mika Brzezinski telling him, ""Go for it."" Scarborough added, ""I'm behind you. You fall down, I'm going to catch you."" Halperin then said, ""I thought he was kind of a d--k yesterday,"" as Scarborough and Brzezinski responded with a combination of shock and laughter. ""Oh my God. Delay that. Delay that. What are you doing?"" Scarborough said. ""I can't believe you. I was joking. Don't do that. Did we delay that?"" Told later that the delay hadn't worked, Halperin noted the remark ""may have ended my career."" After a break, he said he was sorry for the comment. ""This is not a pro forma apology,"" he said. ""This is an absolute apology, heartfelt, to the president and to the viewers. I became part of the joke, but that's no excuse. I made a mistake, and I'm sorry and I shouldn't have said it.""

"(CNN) -- Two Spanish soldiers were among at least six coalition troops killed over the weekend in bombings and attacks around Afghanistan, according to military officials. One member of the International Security Assistance Force, the NATO-led coalition that is fighting al Qaeda, Taliban and other insurgent forces in the embattled southwest Asian nation, was killed Saturday in an attack in southern Afghanistan. The Spanish troops were conducting a reconnaissance patrol in northern Afghanistan, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Qala-i-Naw, when their armored vehicle hit an improvised explosive device, according to a news release from Spain's defense ministry. Sgt. Manuel Argudin Perrino and soldier Niryeth Pineda Marin were killed in the blast. Three other troops were flown by helicopter to a nearby hospital for treatment. Ruben Velazquez suffered various contusions, Jhony Alirio Herrera Trejos had a broken leg and probable broken arm, and Roi Villa Souto a fractured leg. The International Security Assistance Force also announced that one of its members died during an insurgent attack Sunday in eastern Afghanistan. Two service members were killed in southern Afghanistan -- one by an improvised explosive and the other in an insurgent attack. The coalition announced the developments in news releases without additional information, including the victims' nationalities or the circumstances of their deaths. About 271 coalition troops -- most of them from the United States -- have died this year in Afghanistan, with 2,542 killed since the military operation began nearly 10 years ago.","2 Spanish troops are killed by an improvised explosive device, the defense ministry says .

"(CNN) -- After an anxious three-month wait, residents of a northwest Alabama town that lost 18 residents and its business core to an EF-5 tornado learned Monday night that their largest employer will rebuild -- and may add jobs. The announcement by VF Corp. elicited joyous responses by Hackleburg, Alabama, residents -- many of whom honked their horns -- and on Facebook pages that had followed the developments. ""It feels like the weight of the world has been lifted off your shoulders,"" said Hackleburg Police Chief Kenny Hallmark. The April 27 tornado leveled the Wrangler jeans distribution center and killed one employee. It also destroyed or damaged 31 of 32 businesses in town, wiping away most of the town government's revenue sources. Nearly 500 homes were damaged or destroyed. The new facility will be larger, more modern and could bring an additional 50 positions to the community -- for a total of approximately 200 employees, VF said in a statement. It also will have the potential to handle additional shipping capacity. The company, based in Greensboro, North Carolina, will break ground in the second quarter of 2012. Target date for completion is mid-year 2013. ""Throughout the evaluation, Hackleburg remained our leading option based on multiple factors, notably a work force who has demonstrated a passion for their work and a commitment to our company,"" CEO Eric Wiseman said. ""We are also grateful to the state of Alabama for the support and assistance it has provided. We are pleased to continue our longstanding relationship with Hackleburg and look forward to a bright future."" Federal, state and local officials had conducted a full-court press, offering a range of incentives to VF Corp., including $300,000 from the town and Marion County, with millions more from the state. Town officials said Monday night Gov. Robert Bentley was crucial to the effort. Since the tornado, the majority of the displaced workers have been employed at company-owned locations in Hackleburg and, about 70 miles away, in Holly Pond, Alabama. The Holly Pond location will close once the new Hackleburg distribution center is open. No jobs will be lost because that facility was brought back on line to provide work to the displaced Hackleburg employees. The Hackleburg distribution center shipped pallets of Wrangler clothing to Walmart, Target and other retailers around the country. One of five Wrangler distribution points in the nation, the center was well-run and efficient, the company said in June while it was evaluating the site and other distribution facilities. But some of the town's nearly 1,500 residents had worried that Wrangler would not rebuild. Hackleburg's mayor had said the return of Wrangler was crucial for the town's recovery. ""The morale boost it's given this town is unbelievable,"" Mayor Pro Tem Barry McCarley said after the announcement. Leaders had worried about possible layoffs, including in the police force, but Monday's development, the return of some businesses and donations -- including from a Native American tribe -- will brighten the economic outlook. Residents are hopeful the approximately 150 people who left town after the tornado will return. The Hackleburg tornado was one of 62 twisters and storms that swept through Alabama on April 27, killing 247 people. Hallmark and Keith Morrow, Hackleburg's only doctor, told CNN Monday night the announcement may eventually draw new employers and convince others that hadn't started rebuilding to do so. Nancy McCarley, who co-owns the Panther Mart convenience store, likened the excitement Monday night of residents in their 50s and 60s to kids on prom night. ""People are smiling,"" she said. ""It's just great, great, great.""","The Wrangler jeans distribution center will rebuild and may add jobs .

"(CNN) -- Susan River is surrounded by fire. At night, flames are visible on the ridges of the Jemez Mountains, which separate River's and other Santa Fe, New Mexico, homes from the situation to the west in Los Alamos. During the day, River can see only smoke in the distance. ""I look out my front door and see the Pacheco fire and I look out my back door and see the Los Alamos fire,"" said River. River doesn't think she's the only one experiencing such a view. ""I think a lot of people in Santa Fe are in that situation right now,"" she said. ""I think it can be quite depressing if you don't stay on top of that emotionally."" The Los Alamos fire, which is officially called the Las Conchas fire, is roughly 20 miles northwest of River's back door and sparked the evacuation of nearly 10,000 people from the town. It has consumed more than 60,000 acres and none of its perimeters are contained, according to InciWeb, an online database that keeps track of natural disasters such as fires and floods. River, an academic affairs employee at Santa Fe University of Art and Design, hosted one of Los Alamos' evacuees Monday night. ""It's very difficult for him,"" she said. ""It's a very uncertain time. This fire is acting so differently (from ones before) -- it does make me a little nervous."" The Las Conchas Fire began on private land Sunday and expanded into the Santa Fe National Forest and Jemez Ranger District, according to InciWeb. The Pacheco Fire continues to burn in the Pecos Wilderness, two miles north of the Santa Fe Ski Basin. It has scorched 10,000 acres since it began June 18. The blaze was 15% contained Tuesday, but it's very likely to continue growing, according to InciWeb. The Donaldson and Game fires south of Hondo and U.S. Highway 70 have merged into one fire that has consumed an estimated 15,000 acres and is also 0% contained, according to the New Mexico Fire Information website. No structures have been burned, however, and no one has been evacuated due to the fire, which was started by lightning, according to the website. Not only have dry conditions and gusty winds threatened the growth of the fires, but residents in Santa Fe and Los Alamos, including River, fear the effect the Las Conchas fire will have on the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a nuclear science center. The lab is about 35 miles northwest of Santa Fe, but still River worries. ""They say there's no real danger,"" she said. ""But you don't know... it's a little nerve-wracking."" Charles McMillan, the laboratory's director, said Tuesday that all was under control at the facility, regardless of a small fire that broke out Monday. ""The only fire we've had at the lab at all is a very small fire yesterday afternoon,"" McMillan said at a news conference Tuesday with other government officials.  ""Our firefighters saw it quickly and put it out.  It burned something less than an acre.  That's where we stand."" The National Nuclear Security Administration was scheduled to survey the lab Tuesday to measure radiation levels, according to a statement on the Los Alamos National Laboratory website. The fire has raised concerns about whether hazardous materials kept there are being adequately guarded.  McMillan and other officials say the materials are secure, and that any information important to the safety of the public would be announced. Doug Tucker, the Los Alamos fire chief, said the Las Conchas fire touches the south border of the lab's 40-square-mile facility, and comes close to the west border.  He made no promises that it would stay away. But McMillan said lab personnel had prepared for such an event. ""They have anticipated the problem of fire, and they've taken precautions,"" Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico told CNN Monday. ""The structures that are central to the operation of the laboratory are well protected."" At Tuesday's news conference, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez promised citizens that she, too, would provide any information that affected public safety regarding the lab and also warned citizens to avoid using fireworks for July Fourth and the rest of the season. The lab has been closed at least until Wednesday due to the fires and employees are instructed to stay away unless absolutely necessary, said InciWeb. Martinez said she's concerned about the situation. ""That is the reason for the evacuation and that is the reason the team has been brought in to make sure that lab is completely safe,"" Martinez said in a phone interview with CNN Tuesday morning. Voluntary evacuations began Sunday evening in Los Alamos and White Rock, a town southeast of Los Alamos, but quickly became mandatory for Los Alamos residents by Tuesday, according to InciWeb. River attributes the success of such evacuations, in part, to past experiences. ""I think everybody learned a lot from the last fire,"" she said. ""I have to say that from what I can see, the evacuation from Los Alamos was very efficient and it seemed to go off without a hitch."" River plans to leave town if necessary and stay with friends who are out of the way of the fires, she says.

"(CNN) -- William Clements, the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction, died Sunday at the age of 94. Two of his successors in Austin -- George W. Bush and Rick Perry -- were among those expressing sympathy at the Dallas native's death, with the former president calling him ""a great man."" ""He was a political pioneer who served Texas and our country with distinction,"" Bush said in a statement. ""Most of all, he was a friend who will be missed."" An oil-field roughneck before attending college, Clements first made his name and fortune as a co-founder of SEDCO, the world's largest offshore drilling company, according to his biography on the Texas State Library's website. He then served as a deputy U.S. secretary of defense under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He scored a surprise victory in 1978 to become Texas governor. Still, his time was short-lived as voters ousted him four years later in favor of Mark White. Perry, the Lone Star State's current governor, remembered Clements as a ""larger-than-life entrepreneur, public servant ... a mentor (and) the father of the modern-day Texas Republican party."" He ordered flags throughout the state lowered to half-staff in Clements' honor. ""Gov. Clements is responsible for the growth, success and election of Texas Republicans in every corner of our state,"" Perry said.

"(CNN) -- They're young, fabulously wealthy and have blue blood coursing through their veins. Meet the ""20 Hottest Young Royals"" in the world, compiled by influential fortune tracker, Forbes magazine. Britain's Prince William has been named ""Hottest Young Royal"" in the world by Forbes magazine. The magazine used the ""winning combinations of looks, money, and popularity on the Web"" to come up with the list, it says. Only unmarried royals under the age of 35 were considered. The Forbes list proved to be a Royal knockout for British royalty. They came in the top four of hottest young royals in the world. With his piercing blue eyes and lantern jaw, reminiscent of a movie star, Britain's Prince William, perhaps unsurprisingly, came in at Number 1. The magazine describes him as having: ""international intrigue and unparalleled media attention,"" combined with a ""graceful public persona."" Although his crown slipped somewhat recently when he was accused of abusing his newly-acquired flying skills by ""joyriding.""  Watch who people on the street think is the hottest » . His relationship with girlfriend Kate Middleton is the subject of feverish speculation and an engagement announcement is eagerly anticipated by the British media. Seemingly always languishing in William's shadow,  his brother, Prince Harry, placed second on the list. Harry has always been known as the ""bad boy prince"" because of some rather unroyal behavior, such as brawling with paparazzi outside nightclubs and going to a fancy dress party dressed in Nazi regalia. However, he has latterly re-invented himself as the ""Hero prince"" after a tour of duty in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban in March. Sound off: Is Prince William the world's hottest young royal? William and Harry's cousins Zara Phillips and Princess Beatrice also came in at No. 3 and 4 respectively. The inclusion in the list should be good news for Princess Beatrice, who recently attracted unkind comments from Britain's newspaper columnists about her curvy figure and her dress sense. The sight of Beatrice, 19, pictured on holiday in a bikini proved too much for Daily Mail newspaper columnist Allison Pearson, who wrote: ""Can't someone buy that girl a sarong? For her sake, as well as ours."" This led to an angry counterattack from Beatrice's mum, Sarah Ferguson, who thundered at a news conference to promote a reality show: ""Touch me, fine, but don't touch my children."" The 20 featured on the list represent almost $60 billion in wealth and 15 royal lineages from around the world-- including some rather obscure names that even the most ardent royalist might be hard pushed to recognize. Princess Sikhanyiso of Swaziland anyone? Coming in at Number 20, the eldest daughter of King Mswati III of Swaziland, Africa's last absolute monarch, is currently a speech and drama major at Biola University in California. A controversial princess who raises eyebrows in her homeland with her Western-style clothes and a decision to hold a drinking party to celebrate the end of a chastity decree in 2005 resulted in a beating with a stick. Fourth in line to the Monaco throne, Charlotte Casiraghi, is the only non-Brit to make it into the top 5. A style icon, who is known for her impeccable taste in fashion and her good looks--much like her grandmother, Hollywood icon, Grace Kelly and mother Princess Caroline. Her brother, party prince Andrea Casiraghi, also makes an appearance on the list at Number 10. But it seems even his Hollywood lineage -- as well as his sun-kissed surfer looks were not enough to give William and Harry a run for their money in the pin-up stakes.","Prince William tops list of 'Hottest Royal' list compiled by Forbes magazine .

"(CNN) -- The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court requested authorization Thursday to open an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ivory Coast during months of post-election turmoil. In his application to the judges for authorization, prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo cited sources who said at least 3,000 people were killed, 72 people disappeared and 520 others were subject to arbitrary arrest and detentions since the November 28 election that resulted in dispute. Incumbent Laurent Gbagbo refused to cede power even though challenger Alassane Ouattara was recognized as the winner. Months of bloodshed ensued, the political stalemate settled by Gbagbo's capture in April. The prosecutor's office said sources also reported 100 cases of rape, though the number of unreported incidents is thought to be considerably higher. ""The reports quoted by the prosecution provide reasonable basis to believe that pro-Gbagbo forces and pro-Ouattara forces committed crimes falling under the jurisdiction of the ICC,"" said a court statement Thursday. The court said this was the first time it may open a case in a nation that is not a party to the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the International Criminal Court. But Ivory Coast has accepted the jurisdiction of the court. ""President Ouattara sent a letter urging the prosecution to open the investigation and he is working closely with the regional organization ECOWAS to make sure that crimes do not go unpunished,"" the court's statement said. Human Rights Watch urged the court to go beyond the latest wave of violence and look into other possible crimes committed during years of conflict and civil war. ""The ICC prosecutor's decision underscores the importance of holding perpetrators to account for (Ivory Coast's) deadly spate of post-election violence,"" said Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. The global monitoring group said human rights abuses began with violence-marred elections in 2000 and continued in a subsequent armed conflict. It said cases of murder, sexual violence and the use of child soldiers have been documented under the control of Gbagbo and the current prime minister, Guillaume Soro. ""No one has been credibly prosecuted for the crimes during this period, and a 2004 U.N. Commission of Inquiry report on crimes during the 2002-2003 conflict also has been kept secret,"" a Human Rights Watch statement said. Regardless of actions taken by the International Criminal Court, fair and impartial domestic trials will be of utmost importance, the rights group said.","The prosecutor asked the judges to authorize a probe .

"(CNN) -- The top cop in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, escaped a ""sneak attack"" by gunmen early Thursday while on patrol in the city, the Juarez mayor told reporters. Lt. Col. Julian Leyzaola was not injured in the attack. One of the gunmen was injured by return fire from police. The gunmen were carrying out extortion on a local business when Leyzaola's patrol coincidentally came across the incident, according to Juarez Mayor Hector ""Teto"" Murguia. ""If the criminals resist giving up ... well then there will be incidents of confrontation. Until what point? As long as necessary,"" Leyzaola said in an interview earlier this month with CNN in Juarez. On the job for barely three months, the new police chief of Ciudad Juarez -- the globally recognized hot spot in Mexico's drug wars -- predicted bold changes in his new border home and said confidentially during the interview: ""The police will regain the city."" ""The municipal police is still standing ... and will continue fighting,"" Murguia said after the attack. ""The municipal police, particularly the lieutenant colonel, confirm that they will clean up this historic city,"" Murguia said.","Lt. Col.

"(CNN) -- Dan Wheldon was rounding the fourth turn in the last lap at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, foot to the floor and focusing on passing a car when he caught something out of the corner of his eye. What was little more than a blurred glimpse for Wheldon was the center of attention for the thousands in the stands and millions more on television Sunday -- Indianapolis 500 leader J.R. Hildebrand's car grinding against the track's big gray outside wall as he came around the bend, moments from victory. ""As I cleared that car that I was overtaking I noticed that, just in the corner of my eye that he'd got up in the gray and made contact with the outside retaining wall,"" Wheldon told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday. ""And at that point I just focused on making sure that I didn't get caught up in any of the debris, made sure that he didn't come back across the track in front of me."" And then? Then, Wheldon said, he drove ""across the line like I stole it."" The sprint gave the British driver his second Indianapolis 500 victory -- the first came in 2005 -- and a spectacular finish for a race that was once considered among the world's premier sports spectacles, but which has seen its television ratings fall in recent years. The ratings for Sunday's race, its 100th running, were not yet available. But viewership for the 2010 edition was the lowest since the event was first aired live in 1986, according to the Indianapolis Star. About 4 million people watched last year, according to the newspaper. In a posting on the race's official blog, Hildebrand said that he sensed his competition was catching up as he neared the final turn and did not want to risk slowing down to avoid a car coming out of the pits. So he opted to move outside, towards the retaining wall. The move obviously didn't pay off for Hildebrand, who was driving in his first Indy 500 race. The car slipped on what's known in racing circles as marbles -- pieces of soft rubber shed from tires during the race, Hildebrand said. ""It's a helpless feeling driving the race car when you get in a situation like that. It can happen on road courses, it can happen at other places. It's most extreme at a place like this where it truly does turn into a one-groove track towards the end of the-race,"" the posting quoted Hildebrand as saying. ""That was certainly my mistake to have judged it otherwise."" While the finish was a spectacle to remember for race fans, Wheldon said it just goes to show what Indy drivers have long known -- that letting up during a race simply isn't an option. ""With this race, you just never know what can happen, so it's just about staying focused,"" he said. ""And you really don't ever let off the power unless you have to.""","Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon: I ""drove it like I stole it""

"New York (CNN) -- In a city celebrated for its ""cawfeee"" accent and doughnut-shaped rolls, the store that by many accounts is New York's bagel-lovers' paradise is set to shutter its doors. H&H Bagels -- a Manhattan landmark of sorts -- will sell its last homemade dozen and close on Sunday, according to Moshe Fintz, the company's business manager. The store's no-frills business model and doughy circles earned a cult-like following over its 39-year history on 80th Street and Broadway. Many loyal customers aren't taking the news of the closing lightly. ""We have to preserve what's unique about New York,"" said James Besser, a pianist from Manhattan's Upper West Side. ""And what's distinct about us here is the bagels."" Besser started a fledgling grassroots movement to keep the shop running, lobbying City Council members and Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president. The store's owners have been battling financial woes for some time, said Fintz, who said they're being evicted after a tough year marred by tough economic times and a bankruptcy filing in March. He said skyrocketing food prices and increasing rent have made it impossible to keep the store open. But fear not bagel lovers: H&H has a second location on West 46th Street that will remain open. The famed bagel shop may be best known outside New York for its stint on the NBC sitcom ""Seinfeld,"" when it served as the employer of the show's eccentric Cosmo Kramer, played by actor Michael Richards. Still, city dwellers and others often know H&H for its classic creations, baked fresh by the thousands behind a counter where they're sold. ""There's an art form to it,"" Fintz said. ""A lot of guys make bagels, but there's only one H&H."" Not true. A rival shop with the store's name sits on the borough's east side, selling sandwiches and other treats that it's west side counterpart doesn't. But customers don't frequent the landmark store for fancy schmears or gourmet breakfast sandwiches. The bagels -- priced individually at $1.40 -- speak for themselves, regulars say. ""They have the crunchy thing going on on the outside and are nice and soft on the inside,"" said Keely Mills, 28, who lives nearby and says she will mourn the loss of her poppy-seed bagel fix. ""It's classic,"" said neighborhood resident Ana Akasheh. ""Other bagels are very sticky."" Long heralded as bagel royalty of The Big Apple, many New Yorkers insist the H&H brand is second to none. But bagel gurus elsewhere often beg to differ. Irwin Shlafman, the owner of Fairmount Bagel in Montreal, says the bagels of his third-generation shop speak for themselves. ""Our bagel bakery is famous all around the world,"" he said, touting a boiling process with honey-infused water that sets his bagels apart and gives them that ""Montreal-style."" Back in the United States, Michael Wagner, a fifth-generation baker and owner of South Street Philly Bagels in Philadelphia, said it's the water that makes the difference. ""The taste is different because the water tastes different everywhere."" And yet a key ingredient to bagel folklore is simply neighborhood loyalty, he added. ""It's the phenomenon known as 'where you grew up'."" For many New Yorkers, H&H has been their neighborhood preference. The storefront's signature red and white awning has been taken down and a handful of employees are distributing fliers that notify customers of the impending closing. But in the midst of the shop's final days, employees say they have received supportive letters and phone calls from bagel-loving residents long accustomed to the famous store. ""I had no idea how devoted people were,"" Fintz said. Ron BelBruno, 47, is one such devotee. He says he's been frequenting H&H since 1980, and despite no longer living in the neighborhood, he still stops in several times a week. ""This is horrible,"" said the long-time customer, who added that the loss is the latest blow to a series of ""mom-and-pop"" stors across the city. ""(H&H) is the epitome of New York,"" BelBruno added. ""What's going to go here now? A Bank of America? A Duane Reade?"" Regardless of what replaces the iconic store, the most perceptible change could be the loss of a familiar yeast scent on the 80th Street block of Broadway. ""The thing I'm going to miss the most is the way it makes the neighborhood smell,"" said local resident Mills.","New York's famous H&H bagels will close on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- German striking legend Miroslav Klose has signed a two-year contract with Italian side Lazio, following his failure to agree a new deal with Bayern Munich. The 33-year-old leaves the Bavarian giants after four years at the club, although he endured a disappointing season just gone, scoring just once after making most of his 20 appearances from the substitutes' bench. Klose, who is joint second with compatriot Gerd Mueller in the list of all-time World Cup scorers with 14 goals in three different tournaments, told reporters: ""I am looking forward to this new experience and want to help Lazio get back up the Serie A table."" Liverpool close to Henderson deal . Speaking about the transfer, Lazio sporting director Igli Tare told German channel Sport1: ""We hope he brings his skills to us and scores the goals to put Lazio back up where we belong, to be one of Europe's biggest clubs."" Klose, who has netted 61 goals in 109 appearances for Germany and is closing in on Mueller's all-time record of 68 goals, is keen to play in the finals of Euro 2012 and his move hias been welcomed by his national coach Joachim Loew. Loew told reporters: ""It's good for Miroslav if he plays at a club where he is used regularly again."" Klose made his debut for Germany in March 2001, in a 2-1 victory over Albania, and made his name at Kaiserslautern before joining Werder Bremen in 2004 and then Bayern in 2007. He helped Bayern win the German league and cup double in his first year at the club and helped them reclaim the league title in 2010, as well as reaching the final of the Champions League, where they lost to Inter Milan. Meanwhile, Liverpool have completed the biggest signing of the close season so far with the $33m capture of England international midfielder Jordan Henderson from Premier League rivals Sunderland. The 20-year-old has signed a long-term deal with the club and becomes manager Kenny Dalglish's third signing, followingon from Andy Carroll and Luis Suarez, since he returned for a second spell in charge at Anfield. Henderson told Liverpool's official website: ""Obviously it's hard to leave your local club. I'm a Sunderland lad, I've supported them all my life. ""But I'm really looking forward to the future now and obviously this is a massive opportunity for me. I'm really excited by it.""","Miroslav Klose completes a move to Lazio after signing a two-year deal .

With more than six days left to go in the auction on eBay.com, bidding stood at 11,000 British pounds Sunday, or about $17,800, with 43 bids placed. ""I've been amazed by the amount of attention the hat has attracted,"" Beatrice is quoted as saying in the auction listing. ""It's a wonderful opportunity to raise as much money as possible for two fantastic charities. I hope whoever wins the auction has as much fun with the hat as I have."" Beatrice, the daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the duchess of York, wore the rose-colored hat to the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on April 29. It was designed by milliner Phillip Treacy. ""A truly individual, fun but elegant wedding bow becomes the fascinator form,"" says the description in the auction listing. ""This statement piece is worn on the front hairline secured by a clear wire headband that is easily disguised by the wearer's hair. This is a gravity-defying hat."" The listing also shows some of the tongue-in-cheek photos created and posted online, such as one with a cat crawling through the front of the hat. It also inspired a tribute song and a Facebook page, ""Princess Beatrice's ridiculous Royal Wedding hat."" Proceeds from the auction, which ends May 22, benefit The Little Bee Initiative, a campaign set up by the princess to benefit UNICEF UK and Children in Crisis, according to the listing. ""I've been surprised by the overwhelming response to 'the hat,'"" Treacy said in the auction listing. ""...

"(CNN) -- Formula One teams will face a different challenge at this weekend's European Grand Prix as a new tire compound will be used in a race for the first time. Official supplier Pirelli announced on Tuesday that the medium and soft tires will be used for the event  in the Spanish port city of Valencia. The Italian firm's motorsport director Paul Hembery said the decision was a result of the track surface on the street circuit and also the likelihood of warm weather. ""Tire wear on this circuit is likely to be quite high because of the track layout, the nature of the surface, and also the weather conditions,"" Hembery told Formula One's official web site. Latest Formula One standings . ""For all these reasons, we've selected the medium and soft tires, which should provide the teams with a good level of resistance, plenty of different opportunities for strategy and about a second per lap difference between the compounds."" Although the medium compound was not used in any of the 2011 season's opening seven races, the teams did get a chance to test it during a Friday practice session ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix. Mike Gascoyne, chief technical officer for the CNN-sponsored Team Lotus, was satisfied with what he saw from the medium tire in Montreal and is hoping his drivers can take advantage of the speed difference between the two available compounds. ""The prime tire here is the medium which we are racing for the first time this season,"" the 48-year-old said. ""We ran it in on Friday in Canada and it behaved pretty well ... We will be looking closely at how it performs and how we can take advantage of the time difference between the primes and the options on Saturday and Sunday."" Pirelli took over from Bridgestone as the sole tire supplier to the elite division of motorsport at the end of 2010. Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel leads the drivers' standing for Red Bull, 60 points ahead of McLaren's Jenson Button in second place.","Pirelli has announced a new tire compound will be debuted at the European Grand Prix .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council will take up a draft resolution that would establish an interim peacekeeping force for the disputed border region of Abyei, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told reporters Thursday. The draft resolution calls for the deployment of 4,200 Ethiopian National Defense Force peacekeepers to the region. ""We are looking forward to discussions with council members in order to swiftly adopt a resolution authorizing this new interim security force for Abyei so that the agreement that both parties have reached, which is obviously urgent and fragile, can be implemented immediately and effectively,"" Rice told reporters after the Security Council met in closed session. The purpose of the interim security agreement is to allow for the withdrawal of forces from Abyei, she said. ""At this stage that means the forces of the government of Sudan, which are now occupying Abyei, and that that area would become demilitarized and administered in a joint fashion and that would persist pending resolution of the critical underlying issues."" Time for action over Sudan? The Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement signed an agreement Monday that allows U.N. peacekeepers in Abyei. The two sides agreed in principle on the need for a third party to monitor the ill-defined border between north and south before the scheduled July 9 independence for the south. Thursday's announcement came a day after U.S. President Barack Obama applauded the signing of the agreement, the latest effort to quell the violence in Sudan that has forced tens of thousands of people from their homes. ""I commend the parties for taking this step forward toward peace, and I urge them now to build on that progress and agree to an immediate cease-fire in Southern Kordofan,"" the White House said in a statement. Southern Kordofan is the oil-rich northern border state where fighting has also erupted between government troops and forces loyal to the south. Rice said she was concerned about the humanitarian situation in Southern Kordofan. ""We are deeply concerned about attacks on and threats to and intimidation of U.N. personnel, obstructions to freedom of movement and access for humanitarian goods, allegations and indeed verified reports of aerial bombardment and other attacks against civilian personnel,"" she said. ""With a cease-fire in Southern Kordofan, alongside the agreement to deploy peacekeepers to Abyei, we can get the peace process back on track,"" she said. ""But without these actions, the road map for better relations with the government of Sudan cannot be carried forward, which will only deepen Sudan's isolation in the international community."" The people from the Nuba Mountains in Southern Kordofan are northerners but they aligned with the south's rebel movement during Sudan's decades-long civil war. They are viewed as a threat by Khartoum because Southern Kordofan will remain part of the north after independence. ""The treatment of civilians in South Kordofan, including the reported human rights abuses and targeting of people along ethnic lines, is reprehensible,"" said Valerie Amos, the United Nations undersecretary general for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. Between Abyei and Southern Kordofan, about 160,000 people have been displaced from their homes, the United Nations has said. Southern Sudan voted for independence in a January referendum that was largely peaceful. But with its separation pending, tensions have heightened to what they were like during the civil war days and there has been little cause for celebration over the birth of a nation. The U.S. State Department issued a warning Wednesday, urging U.S. citizens to avoid travel to the border areas -- including Abyei and Southern Kordofan -- as well as to the Darfur region of Sudan.","Draft resolution would establish an interim peacekeeping force for Abyei .

"(CNN) -- The Japanese MotoGP will go ahead as planned after a report found that radiation risks from the nearby Fukushima plant damaged in March's earthquake and tsunami were negligible. The October 2 race is to be staged at the Motegi Twin Ring circuit which is 110 miles from the nuclear plant that was badly damaged by the devastating natural disasters that hit the Asian country. Several riders have previously said they would not race at the track but a report published on Tuesday by the International Motorcycling Federation (FIM) found the likely radiation risk was similar to that of Rome or Madrid. It read: ""Based on this report the FIM and Dorna Sports (race organizers) confirm today that, subject to there being no further serious incidents, the Grand Prix of Japan will take place on 2 October as planned. ""As already indicated, ARPA (the agency commissioned to do the report by FIM) has measured levels of radiation from all sources including the air, environment and food. ""The final conclusion is that 'based on the estimate dose it can be said with no doubt that the radiation risk during the race event is negligible.'"" Reigning world champion and current championship leader Jorge Lorenzo said in July that he would not take part in the race and claimed many of his fellow riders felt the same way.","The Japanese MotoGP will go ahead as planned say the sport's governing body .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Toyota's president apologized profusely Tuesday as he announced the global recall of more than 400,000 of the automaker's 2010 hybrid models, including the popular Prius, for problems in their anti-lock braking systems. ""We do apologize for the inconvenience and concerns we've given to the customers,"" President Akio Toyoda said in making the recall announcement from the automaker's headquarters in Tokyo. ""Quality is our lifeline for Toyota."" The company will work to recover its customers' trust, Toyoda said. The automaker filed recall papers early Tuesday afternoon with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Recall papers will be filed in the United States sometime Tuesday. The recall adds to the woes of the beleaguered automaker, which had previously recalled more than 8 million cars in recent months. This latest recall was the first of Toyota vehicles sold in the domestic Japanese market. The worldwide recall involves 437,000 vehicles, including the Toyota Prius and Sai, along with the Lexus HS250h. The Sai is sold primarily in Japan. Sales of the Sai and Lexus HS250h will be halted until a fix is in place. The announcement was made by Toyota President Akio Toyoda and Shinichi Sasaki, vice president of quality control, at the Toyota offices in Tokyo. U.S. officials will be notified of the recall on Tuesday morning. This was Toyoda's second press conference apologizing for Toyota problems since Friday. Toyoda had widely been criticized for remaining silent as recall problems mounted in North America, Europe and China. Last week, the company admitted a problem with the software that controls the anti-lock braking system of the 2010 model of the car and said it had found a solution for cars that started to roll off of the assembly line in Japan last month. It has yet to find a solution for the estimated 37,000 cars already on U.S. roads or the more than 200,000 of the 2010 model year vehicles that have been sold worldwide, but the company said Friday that a solution was ""near."" Jim Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales in the United States, during an online video interview Monday evening, declined to say when -- or if -- Toyota would recall the car. ""We're going to do whatever it takes to make sure our customers feel secure and safe with our products,"" Lentz said of the Prius issue. When the problem was originally brought to light last week, Toyota executives initially described it as a momentary delay in braking when the car was driving over slippery or bumpy surfaced such as ice or rutted roads. Lentz, speaking about the problem on Digg.com Monday, described it as a change in braking feel, a description that Toyota has begun using more recently when talking about the issue. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced last week that it was opening a formal investigation into braking problems with the 2010 Prius. Nearly 125 Prius owners had lodged complaints about the problem. A spokeswoman for the highway safety agency said Monday that Toyota had not confirmed any recall plans. Separately, the total number of vehicles Toyota Motor Corp. has had to recall for gas-pedal related issues now comes to 8.1 million. The 8.1 million figure includes a total of 5.8 million vehicles recalled, around the world, for an issue in which accelerator pedals could become stuck in floor mats. Of those, 5.3 million are being recalled in the United States. A total of 4.5 million vehicles, worldwide, are being recalled for a problem in which gas pedals, as they wear, can become sticky and not come all the way back up when the driver takes his foot off the pedal. Of those, 2.3 million are under recall in the U.S. Toyota officials estimate the total cost of the global recall could be as much as $2 billion, including the loss of 100,000 vehicle sales in the United States and Europe. Last week Toyota posted a $1.7 billion profit for the quarter ending December 31. The company also upgraded its forecast and is projecting to end the fiscal year in March to an $880 million profit. The company previously forecast a $2.2 billion loss this year. In the wake of the recalls, Toyota's share value has dropped about 20 percent. CNN's Kyung Lah, Kevin Voigt and CNNMoney's Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report.","Toyota will recall more than 400,000 hybrid vehicles worldwide for brake problems .

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court is still trying to link Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, his son and his brother-in-law to rapes, but it does not yet have enough evidence to do so, prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday. It has evidence that rapes have taken place in Libya's civil war, he said, but he cannot prove Gadhafi ordered them. The court issued arrest warrants Monday for Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi on other charges. Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi is a close adviser to his father. His arrest warrant came two days after his 39th birthday. Al-Sanussi serves as Gadhafi's head of intelligence. The warrants are ""for crimes against humanity,"" including murder and persecution, ""allegedly committed across Libya"" from February 15 through ""at least"" February 28, ""through the state apparatus and security forces,"" the court said in a news release. The court could file charges against ""one or two other names, but in principle the first investigation focuses on these individuals,"" Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday. The court is not asking international forces operating in Libya to arrest the suspects, he said, explaining that Libya has the primary responsibility to do so as a United Nations member. NATO confirmed in a news conference that it is not seeking to arrest anyone, as that is not part of its mission. Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard of NATO gave a mixed assessment of the mission to protect civilians, saying Libyans were writing ""Thank you, NATO"" on their roofs. But, he said, Gadhafi's forces were using civilians as human shields, making NATO operations ""more difficult, but not impossible."" And he said NATO had reports that government forces had ""put down very severely"" attempts to demonstrate against Gadhafi's rule. ""Security forces continue to inflict pain and harm on the population,"" Bouchard said at a briefing in Naples, Italy, where Operation Unified Protector is based. NATO struck civilian and military locations in the Badr Al-Osta Milad area of Tripoli on Tuesday, Libyan state TV reported without further details. Elsewhere Tuesday, rebels attacked a government weapons depot some 30 kilometers south of Zintan, an opposition stronghold in western Libya. It was a location that had previously been a target of NATO attacks. Two people died and four were injured in the fighting, according to Khalid Shhop, a doctor stationed at the depot. Rebels overtook government forces and were later seen carting away ammunition, he said. At the International Criminal Court, Moreno-Ocampo insisted it is only a matter of time until Gadhafi is arrested, pointing out that Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic was finally seized more than 15 years after a warrant for his arrest was issued. ""The arrest warrants are not going away,"" he said, noting that 161 warrants had been issued in connection with the Yugoslav wars of the early 1990s -- and that 160 suspects have been seized. Libyan rebels could also face arrest warrants, Moreno-Ocampo said. But ""by far the greatest crimes committed in Libya are committed by the Gadhafi forces,"" he said, explaining why the court investigation began with them. And he batted away questions from reporters about whether an ICC arrest warrant would discourage Gadhafi from stepping down, saying the decision to investigate him came from a unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution, not the court. It was ""not our idea,"" he said. In rebel-held Misrata, where fighting has raged, a crowd cheered Monday following the announcement of the arrest warrants. The announcement at The Hague came as fighting inside Libya inched closer to the capital. A rebel fighter, Hassan al-Jiwali, told CNN that rebel forces were 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Tripoli on Monday. Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the international court's authority, but Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday it still had a responsibility to arrest Gadhafi and his allies because it is a member of the United Nations, which ordered the investigation. He said the rebels could also arrest Gadhafi and hand him over. The court does not have the power to enter Libya and arrest the leaders. The U.N. Security Council referred the matter to the ICC through a resolution February 26, following widespread complaints about Gadhafi's efforts to crush a rebellion. The resolution said that, while ""states not party to the Rome Statute have no obligations under the statute, the Security Council urged all states and concerned regional and other international organisations to cooperate fully with the court and the prosecutor."" Gadhafi's backers rejected the court's authority. ""This court is nothing but a cover to the military operations of NATO,"" said Libyan Justice Minister Mohammed Al Qamod. ""It is merely a political tool for exerting pressure and political blackmail against sovereign countries."" Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Ka'eem offered a similar view. ""Both the International Criminal Court and the chief prosecutor have neither the legal competence nor the moral compass in any way to pass judgment on anyone, let alone the Libyan people,"" he said. Michael Rubin, an analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the court's move could damage efforts to get Gadhafi to end his 42-year reign, because he would not seek refuge in a country that is a party or signatory to the Rome Statute. ""The ICC's arrest warrant symbolizes the dirty underside of international law,"" Rubin said. ""While the ICC makes itself feel good and diplomats can chatter about their commitment to international law, the fact of the matter is their action takes off the table any possibility that Gadhafi could flee to a retirement haven outside Libya. In effect, the ICC arrest warrant tells Gadhafi to fight to the death."" Most African countries are parties or signatories to the Rome Statute. The ICC website lists a total of 47 non-signatories in the world, 13 of them in Africa and the Middle East. Journalist David Adams contributed to this report.","NEW: Rebels attack a weapons depot near the western city of Zintan .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Opposition boycotts marred the swearing-in ceremony of Turkey's newly elected parliament on Tuesday. The contentious session took place less than three weeks after Turkey's incumbent Justice and Development Party, or AKP, won a resounding victory in national elections. Led by two-term prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the party captured 327 seats in the 550-member body. But the main Kurdish nationalist party and the largest secularist opposition party both objected after they saw several of their newly elected candidates barred from entering parliament. More than 30 lawmakers from the Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) boycotted Tuesday's session. They protested a decision by Turkey's electoral board last week, which disqualified Kurdish candidate Hatip Dicle for ""not meeting the requirements for being elected into parliament."" The board cited Dicle's 20-month prison sentence after he was convicted of ""making propaganda for a terrorist organization,"" Turkish official-speak for the separatist rebel group known as the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The electoral board replaced the disqualified Kurdish candidate with the runner-up, a member of the ruling political party. The replacement AKP candidate was sworn into parliament on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Kurdish lawmakers protested by gathering hundreds of miles away from the capital, Ankara, in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on Tuesday. ""To show that we do not approve this intervention in democratic politics, we will continue our 'not going to parliament' approach until a solution can be found,"" said Gulten Kisanak, one of the Kurdish party's parliament members, in a phone call with CNN. Lawmakers from the much larger Republican People's Party, or CHP, attended the parliament meeting in the Turkish capital. But almost all of the CHP parliament members symbolically protested, by refusing to participate in the swearing-in ceremony. We ""will not be a part of a group who do not allow elected parliamentarians to take the oath,"" said CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu on Tuesday. ""With this principle and belief in democracy, we as CHP parliamentarians will not take the oath until the right of those who have been elected to take the oath is restored."" Kilicdaroglu referred to two CHP members who won elections on the party's ballot from jail, where they are awaiting trial as suspects in a sprawling investigation into an alleged coup to overthrow the Turkish government. The inauspicious opening of parliament could complicate prime minister Erdogan's much-publicized plans to rewrite Turkey's constitution. Erdogan will need support from two-thirds of the sitting lawmakers, at least 330 members of the 550-person body, to take a new draft of the constitution to a popular referendum. The dispute also highlights Turkey's long-simmering ethnic conflict. More than 30,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed during fighting between the PKK and the Turkish state since the early 1980s. On Sunday, tear gas wafted through the heart of the commercial capital of Istanbul after police clashed with Kurdish activists. And on Monday, a Turkish soldier was killed and three troops wounded in a suspected PKK attack in near the eastern border city of Van, the semi-official Anatolian Agency reported.","Kurds, secularists were upset that several newly elected candidates were barred .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The son of Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal was arrested on a drug charge during a traffic stop in Santa Monica, California, on Tuesday morning, police said. Redmond O'Neal, 26, was convicted on two drug offenses two years ago but was released a year ago from a Pasadena, California, sober living facility where he was undergoing court-ordered drug rehab. On Tuesday, Santa Monica police searched O'Neal's car with his consent and found illegal narcotics, a department spokesman said. No further information was available.

"(CNN) -- For years Japan has embraced ""setsuden"" --""saving electricity"" -- during the country's hot summer months. Among other measures, businessmen and women are encouraged to wear casual summer clothing in the office and to turn the thermostat up on the air conditioning by a few degrees. But this year the concept has been given a new significance as the nuclear crisis in Fukushima has restricted the country's energy supplies and brought ""teiden taisaku"" (""blackout countermeasures"") into the mix. Starting this month the Japan government has called for a 15% cut in electricity use in Tokyo and the Tohoku region to avoid blackouts and power shortages. Japanese Environment Minister Ryu Matsumoto last month said that the reduction would not be a temporary measure, but an event to change people's lifestyles. To complement the official ""setsuden"" advice, Japan's graphic designers have been engaging in some traditional means to help encourage citizens do their part -- providing public information posters. Every day public TV in Japan encourages people to save energy, says Tokyo resident Koichi Yamamoto, who set up a blog for the posters. Yamamoto has been documenting where the posters have been appearing across Tokyo, from convenience stores to around the Tsukiji Honganji temple, and he says, the response to energy saving requests can be seen across the city. ""Lights are turned off in vending machines and many station escalators are only working half of the time,"" says Yamamoto. If traditional means of raising public opinion are on the rise, so too are traditional ways to combat summer heat, says Yamamoto. ""In private many people are stopping to use air-conditioning and started using 'uchiwa' -- a round paper fan,"" he says. On a larger scale businesses have adopted their own energy saving methods. According to the Wall Street Journal, from Wednesday the Casio Computer Company will change weekends for employees to Sundays and Wednesdays to help easy the power load on the electricity grid during the working week. Hitachi and Kyocera are growing green curtains of plants to cover factory walls and encouraging their employees to do the same, according to Bloomberg.","Japan has unofficial summer policy of 'setsuden' -- energy saving .

"(CNN) -- An afternoon at an Oklahoma City water park turned unpleasant for visitors seeking a break from the blazing sun Wednesday. Three women at the Whitewater Bay Water Park in Oklahoma were transported to a hospital after sustaining injuries from debris flung in a sudden summer storm. ""A gust of wind and a quick deluge of rain caused the injuries,"" said Lara O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the city's Emergency Medical Service Authority. ""It happened so abruptly it took the Whitewater Bay swimmers by surprise, but the weather is, in a way, a welcome relief because we were predicted to get up to 113 here."" The injuries sustained were minor and the victims were in good condition as of Wednesday evening. O'Leary said the water park was packed Wednesday with visitors. Paramedics have responded to 269 heat-related emergencies and taken 174 people to area hospitals since a heat advisory was issued on June 17, she said. The heat wave is taking a deadly toll across the nation, particularly on athletes, as two football players and a coach died during summer football practices this week. DonTeria Searcy, a 16-year-old high school student, died Tuesday after he passed out after a morning practice at a Florida football camp, the local sheriff's department said. Another 16-year-old student, Forrest Jones, died Tuesday in a hospital after he passed out during a football practice at an Atlanta-area high school, school administrators said. And on Monday in Texas, Wade McLain, 55, an assistant football coach, collapsed during a morning practice and heat was ruled as a factor in his death, the local medical examiner's office said. The heat wave, now in its second month, is responsible for record-setting electricity use in Texas and dozens of deaths across the U.S. heartland. But this time is especially tough for young football players who don heavy equipment and brave rising temperatures while practicing. ""It is tough and this was an unfortunate incident for us,"" said J.D. Hardin, a spokesman for Georgia's Henry County School District, which oversees Jones' high school.  ""But our coaches have a lot of ways to deal with this. We try to hydrate the players and if they have to move the practices to the morning, I know they will."" On Wednesday, Philadelphia Eagles player Mike Patterson suffered a seizure and collapsed during morning practice, but it was not clear what caused the seizure, the team said. ""Patterson was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital where he is being tested to see why he experienced the seizure. Patterson has had no complications from the seizure,"" the football team said on its website. The team's head athletic trainer, Rick Burkholder, said ""there is nothing in Patterson's medical history to indicate that he is predisposed to having a seizure,"" according to the team website. After Patterson, a veteran defensive lineman, lost consciousness, other teammates tried to shield him from the sun while medics helped him, the football team said. The temperature was about 80 degrees during the Eagles' morning practice. Temperatures reached a record high in Little Rock, Arkansas, Wednesday, soaring to a scalding 114 degrees. It's the hottest day on record for the city, according to CNN affiliate KLRT-TV.  Officials restricted high school football practices to three hours after four student athletes were hospitalized with dehydration, KLRT-TV said. Meanwhile, Texas set a new record for electricity demand Tuesday afternoon, breaking a mark established a day earlier. ""Due to the high temperatures and high electricity usage expected this week, we are continuing to request that consumers and businesses reduce their electricity use during peak electricity hours ... for the remainder of the week,"" said Kent Saathoff of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the state's power grid. The council is forecasting a third straight day of record demand on Wednesday. Though exact nationwide figures for heat-related deaths were not immediately available, blistering temperatures have been blamed for at least 22 deaths in Texas and Oklahoma, authorities said Wednesday. Heat was a factor in 20 deaths in Maricopa County in Phoenix, authorities said. Some school kids in Oklahoma City were dealing with the rising temperatures as 94 classes were without air conditioning Wednesday, said Tierney Cook-Tinnin, spokeswoman for Oklahoma City Public Schools. The school system changed its schedule this year so that students came earlier, starting on Monday, the spokeswoman said. The children have been moved out of the classrooms that did not have air conditioning and staff was frantically trying to fix the problem, Cook-Tinnin said. ""We've hired outside contractors to help us catch up,"" she said. Wednesday marked the 33rd straight day of 100-plus-degree temperatures in Dallas. CNN's Mia Aquino, Chuck Johnston and Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","NEW: Three visitors to an Oklahoma water park are injured Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Not everyone relishes the idea of opening their homes to strangers on vacation. But in an era when many travelers want an experience that takes them beyond conventional hotel chains and tourist traps, hospitality exchanges and private home rentals are flourishing. Such alternatives can come at a high price, as home rental site Airbnb has learned in recent weeks. Thanks to a spate of highly publicized rental horror stories, Airbnb has announced new property protections and safety measures that draw upon some of the best practices already in place among well-known sites such as the Hospitality Club, CouchSurfing and HomeAway, which operates VRBO.com. Airbnb, which pairs people looking for accommodations with hosts for a fee, already represents a hybrid of philosophies underlying hospitality exchanges. It claims to be a community where people ""can build real connections"" with others eager ""to enrich the world through the sharing of space."" But, unlike the Hospitality Club and CouchSurfing, which espouse similar philosophies under the banner of creating a community, money is exchanged and Airbnb takes an additional 15% cut of that transaction. Like Airbnb, HomeAway operates as a marketplace, but communications and financial transactions occur between the guest and host off site, with hosts paying only for their listing. The operators of those services and one frugal traveler offered suggestions on how to protect your home from thieves and vandals. For more information, consult safety policies and rental guidelines on their websites. Airbnb apologizes: 'We have really screwed things up' Research potential guests . Sites like CouchSurfing and the Hospitality Club allow hosts to screen potential guests through their profiles, which often read like personal ads, complete with a picture, offering a more intimate sense of who they are. Plus, user profiles on those sites have rating systems with feedback from previous hosts in the same way sites like Amazon and eBay include buyer and seller feedback. ""You can tell things from the way people describe themselves on CouchSurfing,"" said travel jounralist Matt Gross, former New York Times ""Frugal Traveler"" and author of its new series, ""Getting Lost."" ""When I was in Italy looking for a place, there were profiles of Italian guys in their mid-20s that only wanted women to stay with them. That's a good warning sign."" Because sites like CouchSurfing, Hospitality Club and Airbnb represent collections of people and not just properties, bad incidents don't stay hidden long, he said. ""They're pretty good at policing themselves when things happen. They get talked about and described in user reviews; it usually comes out into open and gets dealt with, as Airbnb is learning,"" Gross said. Airbnb's enhanced profile features include information like whether users have verified their phone number and connected their Facebook account. Hosts also now can set custom trust parameters for bookings so those whose profiles don't meet specified requirements -- such as verified phone numbers, profile descriptions and location information -- will be unable to make a reservation. The Hospitality Club, which has 670,000 members in 200 countries, goes a step further by requiring guests to provide passport numbers so hosts can verify them. ""Checking the person who shows up at your doorstep is a very big deterrent against something bad happening,"" said Veit Kuehne, founder of the Hospitality Club. ""You have to put in some steps to make it harder for criminals and bad people to gain access to your home."" Hosts and property managers should also take it upon themselves to do a little extra work if they're not satisfied with the information available on someone's profile, Kuehne said. Initiate direct contact with guests before they arrive . This is another way for hosts to do a gut check against potential guests. After travelers connect with hosts on HomeAway, communication continues off platform via e-mail or telephone, so hosts have control over whether they ultimately decide to open their home. ""We are a classifieds business: Owners list properties along with contact and telephone information, and they enter into contact with potential guests and they handle transactions,"" said Alexis de Belloy, vice president of HomeAway, which operates HomeAway.com, VRBO.com and VacationRentals.com. ""This allows hosts flexibility and doesn't lock them into a decision until they feel completely comfortable with it."" CouchSurfing is based on the concept of community, where a premium is placed on face-to-face interactions and information sharing . ""Members are encouraged to meet each other, either by hosting and surfing each other's 'couches' or by participating in the several community events that happen daily worldwide. These connections can only be established when the members spend some time with each other -- time is a key factor to build meaningful connections,"" a CouchSurfing spokesman said. Currently, communication between Airbnb users occurs on its platform until a reservation has been paid for, after which hosts can contact guests via phone or e-mail. In an effort to help users make informed decisions, the site has doubled its customer support team to 88 people since last month and will be bringing on a 10-year veteran from eBay as director of customer support next week, CEO Brian Chesky said on the site's blog. Matador Network: 80 things we wish we knew before we started traveling . Require some kind of security deposit . This is relevant to Airbnb and HomeAway because hosts don't always meet their guests, unlike CouchSurfing and the Hospitality Club, where the primary motivator is to find a bed and a new friend to show guests around. HomeAway lets hosts set their own terms for a deposit and also offers the option of a property damage protection plan. Starting at $39 for $1,500 in damage, the plan offers three levels of protection that owners can work into the price of each reservation. Starting August 15, when hosts book reservations through Airbnb, their personal property will be covered for loss or damage due to vandalism or theft caused by an Airbnb guest up to $50,000, the company announced Monday. The Airbnb Guarantee program will also apply to hosts who reported property damage before August 1. Take the risk, if you dare . In a system based on trust and mutual respect, there's always going to be a bad apple or two, Gross said. The chain hotels are there to fall back on, but they come at a price, too. ""The connections between people are what makes travel and life worth living; they're far more valuable to me than anything I could get from a hotel and restaurant,"" he said. ""The fact that we get so upset about someone's house getting trashed shows how rare those instances are.""","Hospitality programs and vacation rental sites connect hosts with guests .

"Minot, North Dakota (CNN) -- A spontaneous burst of applause broke out at a Saturday press conference in Minot, North Dakota, when the city's mayor said the Souris River should crest overnight -- about 12 feet higher than flood stage, but several inches short of what had been feared. ""This is great news,"" said Mayor Curt Zimbelman. This prediction from the National Weather Service proved a rare bright spot in what has been, and continues to be, a trying time for citizens in Minot and neighboring communities. The Souris River, which locals call ""The Mouse"" after the French translation of its name, flows through the center of Minot, a city of about 36,000. About a third of the city's population is under evacuation orders, while at least 3,000 homes have been flooded. One resident, Stuart Dull, told CNN about how he, his wife and two children feverishly packed up their belongings ahead of the approaching waters. What they could move out is stashed in a garage, while the family has found a temporary home in a relative's basement. ""Words kind of escape me,"" said Dull, describing his feeling after later sneaking back toward his home and seeing it under water. ""It's a sense of despair ... and it's maybe a check on some of the things that you hold dear."" Stuart Collum said he spotted the silver chimney and black roof of his house, where he has lived since 1968, on Saturday -- with the rest of the dwelling under water. ""I hate to say it, but I had tears in my eyes this morning. It's a sickening feeling because I knew when I come back it won't hardly be worth fixing. It's almost 100 years old,"" he said. These personal struggles come as local, state and federal authorities rush to minimize the damage to property and maximize security and safety of residents. To the latter point, Minot officials announced a ""boil-water order"" Saturday afternoon, telling residents to boil tap water for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms. Around 6 p.m. Saturday, following a hot and sunny day, residents got a fresh scare when tornado sirens started blaring as a powerful thunderstorm bore down on Minot. Joshua Scheck, a National Weather Service official, told CNN, ""The city of Minot pulled the sirens out of extreme caution."" The clouds indicated a system that could generate tornadoes, but the intent was even more to alert the scores of National Guard, police and other personnel working to address the flooding to seek cover from the coming storm. ""There was no sign of vertical rotation or tornadoes,"" said Scheck, noting the storm system should pass through the city by 7:30 p.m. The focal point in Minot continues to be the Broadway Bridge, a critical north-south route through town. Officials have been working round-the-clock to prevent the river from inundating nearby routes, all part of larger efforts aimed at preventing Minot by effectively being split in half by the flooding. ""It's really important that (Broadway) bridge stays open,"" said Cecily Fong, spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. On Saturday afternoon, the National Weather Service reported water levels at that bridge stood at 1,561.62 feet with an expected crest around midnight of 1,561.8 feet. This is well above the flood stage of 1,549 feet, but still below the worst forecasts -- and the reason for the outpouring of relief, after Zimbleman's announcement at a press conference. Republican Rep. Rick Berg said he had been in touch with officials in Washington -- which has authorized FEMA to grant assistance -- and expressed optimism that the government will work well with residents to overcome the challenges. ""You're seeing people at the highest levels working together, putting politics behind them,"" said North Dakota's lone congressman. ""And I've seen American flags (that) reminded me how, in the face of challenges, we come together as a country."" Berg, though, cautioned that this was a ""marathon"" that still had a ways to go. For instance, water levels near the Broadway Bridge were still expected to remain around 1,561 feet through Tuesday -- well above the record of 1,558 feet -- with a slow drop over the coming week. And the worst is yet to come in other North Dakota locales. In the small city of Sawyer, for instance, water levels Saturday morning were 5 feet above flood stage and forecast to rise much further, to 30.5 feet, through overnight Sunday. This situation prompted the evacuation Saturday of the city's 350 residents as water from the Souris River began to slosh up a main street through town, according to a U.S. Corps of Engineers official. Water began flowing up First Street on the northwest side of town early Saturday morning, said Shannon Bauer, a public information officer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The river stood at five feet above flood stage Saturday morning. It is forecast to rise nearly 2 1/2 more feet at Sawyer before cresting on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Crews are engaged in a ""touch and go"" struggle to build a temporary levee to stop the flow of water through the now-vacant town, according to Bauer. ""We have not given up,"" Bauer said. To the northeast, in Minot, about 15% to 20% of the city was under water as of Friday. Fire Department Battalion Chief John Hocking called the conditions there ""by far the toughest we've ever seen."" Ken and Janelle Herslip own one of those homes. Located less than a mile from the Souris, it's already flooded and more water is expected, Ken Herslip said Saturday. Even though a crew of more than three dozen friends and family helped them evacuate on Monday -- scouring the house of everything that wasn't attached to the walls, Herslip said his wife is still devastated. ""We've had many homes over our life and she finally got the house of her dreams,"" he said. ""She is absolutely devastated, bawling all the time."" Herslip, who built the house, isn't so busted up. No one was hurt, and they can build again, he said. Still, he said, ""it will never be the same."" Dull voiced similar sentiments after the floodwaters forced him and his family out of their home -- leaving them safe, even as they're left largely helpless without flood insurance as the waters roll in. An overwhelming positive from this whole ordeal, he said, is how city residents have rallied to support one another. ""The community that we live in, they're absolutely great,"" said Dull. ""All around, there are people helping people, strangers helping you move, everyone is so helpful. ""I just can't say enough about living in this town ... It's comforting to know that people care for you, even strangers."" CNN's Mike Pearson, Jim Spellman, Alta Spells, Phil Gast and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","NEW: Tornado sirens go off in Minot, but there's no sign of any twisters .

"(CNN) -- Italian Serie A outfit Juventus have completed the signing of Montenegro striker Mirko Vucinic from rivals Roma. Vucinic, 27, had been in the Italian capital since 2005 and has signed a four-year deal with Turin-based Juve. The former Lecce forward is Juve's fourth new arrival of the off-season, following the acquisitions of Chile's Arturo Vidal, Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo and Switzerland duo Stephane Lichsteiner and Reto Zeigler. The two-time European champions have also completed permanent deals for Italy quartet Fabio Quagliarella, Simone Pepe, Alessandro Matri and Marco Motta, who spent last season on loan at the Stadio Olimpico. ""I'm both excited and happy to be playing for Juventus,"" Vucinic told the club's official web site. ""AS Roma was in my heart but it's over now. I'm very happy to be here playing for Juventus."" Juve begin the 2011-12 season with a trip to Francesco Guidolin's Udinese on August 28. Despite losing Vucinic, Luis Enrique's Roma announced the arrival of Netherlands goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg from Ajax on Monday. The 28-year-old, who was part of the Dutch squad which reached the final of 2010 FIFA World Cup, has also signed a four-year contract. Stekelenburg made 191 appearances for Ajax after making his debut in 2002 and has 40 caps for Bert van Markwijk's national side. Elsewhere, Barcelona's Jeffren Suarez will hold talks with Sporting Lisbon over a move to the Portuguese club. Jeffren was part of Spain's under-21 squad which recently won the European Championships and has left Barca's tour of the U.S. to discuss the transfer. The 23-year-old made eight appearances for the Spanish champions last season and scored one goal -- in Barca's 5-0 thrashing of arch rivals Real Madrid in November.","Juventus announce the signing of Montenegro striker Mirko Vucinic from Roma .

"(CNN) -- More Arizona and New Mexico residents Wednesday returned to their homes, in some cases to find them intact, in other cases to sift through debris left by a massive wildfire. The Wallow fire in east central Arizona is one of 58 large wildfires burning in the United States, from Alaska to Florida, according to the National Interagency Coordination Center. All told, the fires have burned 2,166 square miles or 1.4 million acres -- nearly the size of Delaware. The largest of the fires continues to be Arizona's Wallow fire, which has burned 529,825 acres so far, the fire's incident command team announced Wednesday. Officials said it is about 58% contained. While residents in Greer, Arizona, and Luna, New Mexico, have been allowed home, evacuation orders remain in effect in other locations. Residents in parts of Apache County, Arizona, also have been told to be prepared to evacuate should. CNN iReporter Andrew Pielage, a hotel manager in suburban Phoenix, took photos of burned homes in Greer. ""As a photographer, I'm here to document what's happening,"" Pielage said. ""Just because the flames are out doesn't mean the fire is done with. I really feel for the people of Greer and their loss."" Pielage said he was impressed by the perseverance of firefighters and those who live in the community. ""The photos document both the relentless work the firefighters did to save the homes of Greer as well as, tragically, the ones they could not,"" he said. Greer residents were ordered to evacuate on June 6, two days before the Wallow fire blew through their town of about 200 inhabitants and scorched at least 22 homes and 24 outbuildings. They were allowed home beginning Monday. A voluntary evacuation order was issued Wednesday for Pender County, North Carolina, residents affected by a fire. More than 18,000 acres have burned in the Holly Shelter Game Land area northeast of Wilmington, officials said. No homes had been damaged. In Texas, a fast-moving fire near Grimes County destroyed at least 26 homes as it burned across more than 4,000 acres. The fire was caused by homeowners grilling near Stoneham, Texas, CNN affiliate KHOU-TV reported. Grimes County Sheriff Don Sowell said officials have identified a person of interest who is believed to have built the barbecue pit that started the fire, but authorities do not believe there was any intent of arson. The speed of the fire forced evacuations of whole subdivisions throughout the area. Jerome Seeberger, who owns 40 acres in Grimes County, said there is just one word to describe the scene. ""Apocalypse,"" he told KHOU as he stood in front of a backdrop of charred trees. ""I've never seen anything like this. Such a beautiful forest two days ago and now look at it."" The number of wildfires so far this year is below the 10-year average for the United States, according to the U.S. Forest Service. But the number of acres burned is three times that 10-year average, according to the agency. While some state and local authorities have reported stretched resources from the widespread fires, Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell told Congress last week that there's plenty of capacity to continue fighting fires. The U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the Interior have about 16,000 trained firefighters available nationwide, Tidwell said. The agency also has left-over funds from previous years to pay higher-than-usual firefighting costs. Two Florida Division of Forestry firefighters died Monday while fighting a wildfire in north-central Florida that had been declared contained but suddenly burst out of control, Amanda Bevis, a division spokeswoman, said Tuesday. CNN's Craig Bell contributed to this report.","More than 10,000 firefighters battle wildfires in 12 states .

"(CNN) -- Ecuador's Antonio Valencia has signed a new four-year deal with English Premier League champions Manchester United. Valencia, 25, arrived at United from Wigan Athletic in June 2009 and he has penned a contract which will keep him at Old Trafford until May 2015. The former Villarreal winger has made 69 appearances for the three-time European champions, scoring 10 goals, and Valencia was happy to have committed his future to Alex Ferguson's team. ""I am delighted to stay at United,"" Valencia told the club's official web site. ""Since my first day at Carrington [the team's training ground], I have been happy here. I hope that I can continue to develop as a player. ""I am looking forward to making my contribution to helping this squad compete for more trophies."" Ferguson, 69, praised Valencia's attitude after he recovered from a broken ankle sustained in September 2010 to play a part in United's title run in. ""Antonio has made a fantastic contribution since his arrival. His speed, crossing ability and versatility have been a big asset for us. ""He has a quiet, unassuming way of going about his business, which is underlined by great strength of character -- as his recovery from such a bad injury last season proves."" Injury restricted Valencia to just 10 league appearances for the Red Devils last season, although he did regain fitness in time to play a part in United's European Champions League final defeat to Barcelona in May.

"(CNN) -- Golfer Tiger Woods is set to return to the PGA Tour Thursday after a three-month hiatus, but this time without his longtime caddie Steve Williams. Woods' participation in the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio -- an event he has won a record seven times -- comes after months of recuperation following knee and Achilles injuries. Speaking to reporters after a practice round Tuesday, Woods said he was feeling the fittest he had in ""years"" and was experiencing no ill effects after surgery on his left leg. ""It feels solid, it feels stable, no pain. That's one of the reasons why I took as long as I did to come back is that I want to get to this point where I can go ahead and start playing golf again like this,"" he said. ""It's been a very long time, and it feels good to go out there today and hit balls like this, go practice and feel nothing and walk around and pretty much do anything I want on the golf course."" It will also be his first appearance since he fired his caddie, Steve Williams, who worked for him for 12 years. Asked about last month's breakup -- amid reports Williams said he felt he'd wasted the past two years of his life -- Woods responded that he had ""felt it was time for a change."" He and Williams had had ""an amazing run,"" Woods said. ""He's a hell of a caddie, there's no denying that. He's helped my career and I think I've helped his as well. ""We've had a great partnership for 12 years, won a bunch of tournaments, but I just felt it was time to change things up a little."" Woods will tee off at 1.40 p.m. at Firestone Country Club, with his friend Bryon Bell caddying for him. Woods withdrew from the PLAYERS Championship in May because of the injury to his left knee and a strained Achilles tendon. He missed the British Open earlier in July, along with the U.S. Open in June, because of his injuries. He has since been working to rehabilitate his injuries, and recently began hitting practice shots, the statement on his website said. The 35-year-old Woods, winner of the British Open in 2000, 2005 and 2006, also missed the 2008 tournament at Royal Birkdale following reconstructive knee surgery after his U.S. Open victory a month earlier. Woods hasn't won a tournament since he took a break from the game after revelations about his private life emerged. The golfer divorced Elin Nordegren, his wife of six years, in August 2010 after admitting to transgressions in his private life and following reports of extramarital affairs.","Woods took a three-month break due to injury .

"(CNN) -- Which way will the housing market go? That's the million-dollar question for so many Americans who are underwater on their mortgages and for the one in three who rents and represents the homeowners of tomorrow. We've all heard about how real estate prices have crashed. But in every time of hazard, there's also great opportunity to build long-term wealth. You just need the guts to zig when others zag. In this chapter, I'll show you how you can score a deal on a distressed property, reduce your mortgage interest rate, lower your property taxes and save money on some of the major purchases for your home, like appliances. I'll also warn you about common pitfalls, including burglar alarm monitoring and home warranties and other things that are way out there, like electronic mortgage fraud. Before you buy: Short sales and deeds in lieu are the new foreclosures . Whether you're a buyer or a seller, a short sale or a deed in lieu of foreclosure may present a way to get out from underneath an upside-down house or get a great deal on distressed real estate. For a seller, a short sale is one in which you work with a lender to market your home and sell it for less than the mortgage balance. While short sales were once considered more favorable than foreclosures, now both harm your credit to the same degree, lowering your score by roughly 140 to 150 points. As a mark on your credit file, they'll each stay with you for seven years. For a buyer, a short sale can mean getting a home at a great price if you're willing to play what can be a long waiting game. About two years ago, lenders agreed to guidelines in which they were supposed to acknowledge an offer on a short sale in four days and answer back in 45. But that never happened in practice, and typical wait times on an offer are substantially longer. Joel Larsgaard, at 27 the youngest producer on my radio show, recently put bids in on seven short-sale properties, month after month, for the better part of a year. All his offers were turned down. Finally, his eighth attempt worked, and he got his short sale for $89,000 with a 15-year loan at 4.375%. The property had last sold for $155,000! It took great sacrifices for Joel to come to the closing table with enough money for a 20% down payment. But he did it, and now his monthly mortgage note is $560, not including taxes and insurance. Think about that. Some people have monthly car payments that are higher than his mortgage payment. One special warning for sellers: Be careful with the paperwork your lender gives you as part of the short-sale agreement. Some lenders are behaving immorally and slipping in legalese that makes their financial loss your legal obligation to pay back. That is not the intent or purpose of a short sale. In today's market, deeds in lieu offer what I believe is a better alternative to short sales for sellers. With deeds in lieu, the bank agrees to take your home back without foreclosing on it. It also agrees not to seek deficiency, which is loss on the loan that banks are entitled to in most states. As a bonus, deeds in lieu have much less impact on your credit score than does a short sale or a foreclosure. So at this point I'm recommending that if you absolutely need to get out from under your house, a deed in lieu should be your first choice and a short sale your second. Never buy property without looking at it . Over the years, con artists got notoriously rich by selling people Florida swampland. This rip-off was especially popular in the 1960s and 1970s when future retirees bought property that was basically worthless because it was all wet. It became such a well-known scam that it didn't work anymore -- until the mid-2000s when what was old became new again and the con artists came back to prey on another generation. Sometimes people are all too quick to buy a dream and will suspend disbelief to buy land without seeing it. One of the new equivalents of swampland in Florida has been desert land in Utah. The New York Times reported that Box Elder County, Utah, intended to file charges against cons who had sold parcels of land over the phone and Internet to 3,000 people in the United States, Europe and Australia. The land was supposedly adjacent to a city. But when people would go to Utah to see their new homestead, they'd find that no such city even existed. Worse still, the land they'd purchased could not be developed because to do so would violate local and state zoning laws. This new twist on the old rip-off scheme of land speculation started when cons took advantage of a Utah land rush and bought up property that was parched and desolate. Then they illegally subdivided the land and sold five-acre spreads. The New York Times article was cute in a way. They sent a reporter to find one of these ""conveniently located"" parcels in Lucin, Utah. The reporter got to the location -- some 150 miles away from the nearest big city -- and found an area where the only inhabitants were a snake, a beetle and large ants! I have two simple rules to follow when buying land. First, never buy property without seeing it. Second, make sure the land has water rights or it's going to be useless to you. This second caveat is especially important if you're buying in one of the mountain states, like Utah. Use a home inspector before buying or selling . If you are considering buying a house, I urge you to have your own inspection. First-time homeowners often skip the inspection because they think government workers have somehow inspected the house. Although they have, these kinds of inspections are not enough. Think about when a hospital, school, or office building is erected. There is a construction manager who makes sure things are being done as they should be. You want someone who does the same thing for you. It's especially important if you're having the house built. Be sure you don't hire an inspector your real estate agent recommends. Recent reports show that 70% of people do this. Agents suggest only those inspectors who they know will not kill their deal, and that is not in your best interest. You want someone who will kill the deal if the house is not in good shape. Two sites that offer great referrals are the American Society of Home Inspectors' website at ASHI.com and the National Institute of Building Inspectors at NIBI.com. NIBI requires that its inspectors carry errors and omissions liability insurance, which means they accept responsibility for any oversight. You also want someone who is certified by the Council of American Building Officials (CABO), which means they are current on all building codes. Spend some additional money when buying a house and get an inspection. It's worth it. And before you sign a contract with a home builder, make sure you inspect the contract. Some builders forbid you from hiring an inspector and that wording is included in the contract. So if you see it in there, give that builder the boot. The same idea applies when you're selling a home. Before you go to market, you should hire an inspector to carefully vet your home. Be sure to fix whatever needs repair, and have the inspector's report and your receipts available for prospective buyers to examine. As a seller, you have to psychologically try to get inside the head of a buyer. Even though a buyer might consider a used home, they still want it to be as perfect as a doll house. So let's say a corner of your roof needs repair and you don't spend the money to fix it. When their inspector finds it, the buyer is more likely to blow the cost of the potential repair out of proportion and make a lower offer on your house accordingly.

"New York (CNN) -- Forty-two years after a police raid sparked rioting and perhaps the birth of the American gay rights movement, New Yorkers rejoiced at their city's annual pride parade Sunday in celebration of same-sex couples' newly-acquired right to wed. The parade, or march, meandered along Manhattan's Fifth Avenue and passed in front of the famous Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, where the rioting took place in 1969. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill into law on Friday that made New York the sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage, more than doubling the number of Americans living in states that permit such unions. The measure will take effect 30 days after it was signed, on July 24, providing same-sex couples with a slew of new rights that include employer health benefits, easier inheritance and a host of state tax breaks. Federal recognition, however, was not a part of Friday's vote, leaving benefits like Social Security and ease of immigration largely out of reach for same-sex couples. Marching with supporters on Sunday, Cuomo told reporters that the country looks to New York as a guide for many of its progressive politics. ""The point of civil rights laws is to protect everybody -- both the people who look like us or who we relate to and the people who don't,"" said Suzanne Goldberg, a professor at New York's Columbia Law School. ""The point of a parade that celebrates gay pride is to make room for all people who identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender."" The controversial bill passed a Republican-controlled Senate before reaching Cuomo's desk, in an extended legislative session that left many skeptical over whether lawmakers would bring the measure to a vote. Its passage also sparked sharp criticism from opposition lawmakers, who warned of potential lawsuits against religious institutions -- a question that delayed deliberations and ultimately resulted in an amendment to the bill to protect religious groups from litigation. Religious leaders also cautioned against the wider implications of redefining the legal parameters of marriage. ""We worry that both marriage and the family will be undermined by this tragic presumption of government in passing this legislation that attempts to redefine these cornerstones of civilization,"" the state's Catholic bishops said in a joint statement released late Friday. It was signed by Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan and seven other bishops. Asked what his message was for the gay community, Dolan said Sunday morning, ""I tell the gay community I love you very much, and every single morning when I say my prayers, I pray for (the) health and happiness of everyone in New York. ""I'm very sorry that our opponents succeeded in reducing this to anti-gay sentiment,"" he said. ""It's not. It's pro-marriage, it's not anti-gay."" But, he said, there was ""sadness and disappointment"" when the bill passed. ""We as Catholics would oppose any attempt by anybody to redefine marriage,"" Dolan said. ""We don't believe marriage can be changed or radically altered to accommodate any lifestyle. If anything I've said would lead you to believe I have nothing but love and respect, then I apologize."" The bill passed by a narrow 33-29 vote -- a first for a GOP-led state Senate. Meanwhile, those in attendance for Sunday's parade were largely one-sided in their perspective. ""I think it's better because there should be equality,"" said Katie Worral, 17, who was visiting New York from Liverpool, England. ""At the end of the day, we're all human beings."" ""I think it's awesome,"" said Robin Rosser, 49, who traveled to New York from Union, New Jersey, for the parade. ""This is number six and there will be many more to come."" ""It's a total breakthrough,"" said Kathryn Flowers, 22, of Queens, New York, who stood beside her partner as they cheered on marchers. ""There's so many people who have been together for years.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A top coalition general wounded in a suicide attack Saturday in northern Afghanistan -- one that left seven dead and eight others hurt -- said weeks earlier that he'd charged international troops to ""show Afghans ... respect,"" in part to contrast with brazen actions by the likes of the Taliban. The attack in Taloqan occurred at a high-level meeting of Afghan and coalition officials in a governor's office, a provincial spokesman said. A Taliban spokesman said that the group, whose fight to resume control in Afghanistan has picked up in recent months, was responsible. Maj. Gen. Markus Kneip, a veteran German office and the regional head of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force across nine provinces of northern Afghanistan, is in stable condition after suffering non-life threatening injuries, a German general said. The provinces border Turkmenistan east to China. A soldier since 1975, Kneip is also senior commander of  all German troops in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, according to a biography on the military alliance's website. He returned in February to the position, which he also held in 2006, leading more than 12,000 coalition troops from 16 countries. In an April press briefing coordinated by the U.S. Department of Defense, Kneip said he'd noticed a ""huge difference"" in the coalition commitment to the region compared to five years earlier, saying ""we are doubling and tripling our efforts."" He also spoke of the ""huge burden"" placed on coalition troops ""to be careful with their actions"" in order to win over Afghans. ""We ask them to follow these rules (to) distinguish our actions from the Taliban, who take advantage of children, who take advantage of children, and put (suicide attackers) in, which is a cruel doing,"" Kneip said, according to a transcript of his answers on the U.S. Department of Defense website. The attack came at a meeting, held in the governor's office in Taloqan, ""to talk about security in this region, especially after the demonstrations in recent days,"" German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere told reporters. He was referring to a May 18 incident in which German soldiers shot in front of their camp a number of demonstrators -- angry about NATO airstrike that killed four insurgents, including two armed females -- who they allege had become violent. Provincial government spokesman Faiz Mohammad Tawhidi blamed protesters whom he said threw grenades and ""opened fire on protesters and security forces."" Two German soldiers and four Afghan guards were injured during the clashes, according to the German military. ""New trust was to be initiated,"" de Maiziere said of Saturday's meeting. The meeting attendees included high-ranking authorities from the Afghan National Police, the Afghan National Army and ISAF members, said an interior ministry spokesman, Zemaray Bashari. In a telephone interview, Taliban spokesman Zabulliah Mojahed said, ""Our sacrificed mujahedeen targeted the high-ranking Afghan authorities together with the international forces who were attending a security meeting as advisers and they were planning to launch an operation against the Taliban in the north in this meeting."" ""After our mujahedeen found (out) about this meeting, then it was targeted by our suicide bomber,"" he told CNN from an unknown location. Two Germans were killed, as was thepolice chief of Takhar province, Shah Jahan Noori; and the regional police chief, Gen. Dawood Dawood, said Faiz Mohammad Tawhidi, a spokesman for provincial Gov. Abdul Jabar Taqwa. Dawood Dawood was a veteran anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban resistance commander. His roles since the Taliban's ouster include being one of Afghanistan's lead point-persons in trying to stifle the production of opium poppies -- from which the drug heroin is made. The governor's secretary and two guards were also killed, said Qari Sadiqullah, secretary of the provincial council. Most of the wounded suffered burns, he said. Taqwa himself was wounded, his spokesman said.So, too, were three German soldiers, according to de Maiziere. The German general told reporters that Kneip and other commanders had participated Saturday morning in a memorial ceremony for a German soldier who had died Wednesday near Kunduz. ISAF spokesman Rear Adm. Vic Beck condemned what he called ""the senseless murder of these Afghans and coalition members who have fought so hard for the people of Afghanistan. ""ISAF will remain relentless in our support to our Afghan partners to find those responsible and bring them to justice,"" he said. The attack came two days after eight U.S. troops died when two improvised explosive devices blew up in Shorabak District, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Kandahar, according to ISAF. That region -- on the opposite end from where Saturday's attack occurred -- has been the site of a spate of recent violence, after Taliban forces unleashed multiple attacks earlier this month in their so-called spring offensive.

"(CNN) -- With four home-based major champions in the Irish Open field, Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh stole the show in Thursday's opening round with a dazzling round of 63. The 39-year-old's eight-under-par effort was six shots better than British Open winner Darren Clarke, seven ahead of U.S. Open victor Rory McIlroy and nine clear of the young Northern Irishman's 2010 predecessor Graeme McDowell. Dubliner Padraig Harrington, who kickstarted Ireland's golfing success with three major victories in 2007-08, was 10 shots behind Singh at Killarney. Singh, a three-time winner on the European Tour, carded six birdies and an eagle as he equaled the best score of his career to end the day two shots clear of France's world No. 546 Alexandre Kaleka -- who birdied five holes in a row from the 12th. Clarke dreaming of Open double . ""I don't know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, but 59 did cross my mind,"" said Singh, whose sixth place at last weekend's Scandinavian Masters was his best after two years of injuries sent him tumbling outside the top-200. Former U.S. Open champion Michael Campbell was a surprise sight near the top of the leaderboard, with the New Zealander -- now ranked 701st -- tied for third with Germany's Marcel Siem and Sweden's Christian Nilsson on 66. The 42-year-old Clarke is under the weather after admittedly over-celebrating his first major title at Royal St. George's on July 17. ""I didn't come here to make up the numbers. I hit a lot of good shots and had lots of chances, but didn't quite have the speed of the greens,"" he said after his four-birdie 69. McIlroy led by two shots early in the day but closed with a double-bogey after hitting the water at 18 to sign for a 70, while McDowell and last year's runner-up Harrington both struggled after missing the cut in Sandwich. Defending champion Ross Fisher was in a big group tied for sixth on 67. Meanwhile, South Korea's Meena Lee claimed the first-round lead at the Women's British Open after carding a seven-under 65 in wet conditions in Scotland on Thursday. The 29-year-old fired seven birdies at Carnoustie to be two shots clear of American Brittany Lincicome and three ahead of her compatriot Amy Yang, Germany's Caroline Masson, Sweden's former champion Sophie Gustafson and U.S. player Angela Stanford. In a tie for seventh place on 69 were Caroline Hedwall, Momoko Ueda, Na Yeong Choi, Amy Hung, Song-Hee Kim, Lorie Kane, Paula Creamer and Mika Miyazato.","Jeev Milkha Singh leads Irish Open after shooting eight-under-par 63 in first round .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams swept aside Anastasia Rodionova in her first match on American soil since the 2009 U.S. Open, as she recorded an emphatic 6-0 6-0 victory at the Bank of West Classic in Stanford, California. Williams, 29, took just 47 minutes to defeat the Russian in only her third tournament back after nearly a year out of the sport following two foot operations and a blood clot in her lung. The 13-time major winner, who has slumped to a career-low ranking of 169 in the world as a result of her prolonged absence, restricted her 29-year-old opponent to just five game points -- none of which Rodionova was able to convert. ""I wanted to be more consistent, and I think I did that tonight,"" the American told a post-match press conference. ""I feel good. I don't think of the match as being easy, I think it was just me being focused. I was out there just trying to do my best."" Williams was eliminated in the fourth round of Wimbledon in June, a grand slam she has won on four occasions, and she said her disappointing performance at the All England Club served as motivation to regain her best form. ""I didn't deserve a break after Wimbledon. I didn't practice on the plane ride back, that was about it. I want to get back to the top and win. I have no patience ...

"Kuwait City (CNN) -- Protesters in Kuwait clashed with security forces on Saturday, the second straight day of unrest in the tiny Persian Gulf nation. The demonstration occurred in Sulaibiya, just north of Kuwait City, witnesses and a government official said on Saturday. Hundreds of protesters calling for greater rights for longtime residents who are not citizens of the country demanded the release of people arrested in demonstrations Friday. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Col. Adil Al-Hashash, told CNN that the security forces called on protesters to stop demonstrating and to take their grievances through legal channels. The protesters attacked the security forces, who managed to disperse the people and make arrests, he said. The forces used tear gas on the demonstration involving between 200 and 400 protesters. On Friday, more than a thousand protesters clashed with security forces in Al-Jahra province, north of Kuwait City. The crowd -- initially 300 people before quickly growing -- was attacked with water cannons. A government spokesman later claimed that the security forces were trying to protect themselves after the protesters started hurling rocks. Kuwait has been wrestling with the question of rights for noncitizen residents for decades.

"Baltimore (CNN) -- Acknowledging it is out of the ordinary for city mayors to take a stand on military policy, the U.S. Conference of Mayors passed a resolution Monday calling for an early end to the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""This is not a war resolution,"" said the newly elected president of the group, Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. ""What we wanted to make clear,"" he told reporters afterward, is that ""the best way to support and honor those troops is to give them a job when they come back home."" The outgoing president of the Conference of Mayors, Republican Elizabeth Kautz of Burnsville, Minnesota, said the resolution is simply ""calling on Congress to redirect military spending to domestic priorities."" But dissenting mayors said the resolution might send the wrong message, and one called for it to be withdrawn before the group could vote. Blitzer's Blog: Getting out of Afghanistan . Peter Lewis, the nonpartisan mayor of Auburn, Washington, told his colleagues that ""making political statements in this forum about the war, I do not believe is proper."" The Conference of Mayors last addressed American military policy when it called for an end to the U.S. war in Vietnam, and some mayors expressed concern that the current resolution could be taken badly by the troops now deployed. ""Let's not go and make the mistakes another generation did,"" Lewis said. ""So I urge that this resolution be defeated."" Other mayors pushed ahead, saying there are economic problems in the United States with a more pressing priority than the massive spending on the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""This one does not call for an immediate withdrawal,"" said the Democratic mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, Paul Soglin, ""but it calls for speeding up the effort to end this war."" ""We are at a point where municipalities are faced with cuts in services that affect all of our citizens, especially those that are in need the most,"" he said. Mayors then proposed and approved amendments changing the wording to express support for U.S. troops and acknowledging what was called the need for a strategic, stable pullout of American forces. With those changes, the mayors then approved their resolution with a call to ""bring these U.S. war dollars home."" As read by the parliamentarian, this is the amended resolution passed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors: . Calling on Congress to redirect military spending to domestic priorities . -- Whereas, every member of the United States Conference of Mayors and the Americans they represent support our brave men and women and their families; and . -- Whereas, the drawdown of troops should be done in a measured way that does not destabilize the region and that can accelerate the transfer of responsibility to regional authorities; and . -- Whereas, the severity of the ongoing economic crisis has created budget shortfalls at all levels of government and requires us to re-examine our national spending priorities; and . -- Whereas, the people of the United States are collectively paying approximately $126 billion per year to wage war in Iraq and Afghanistan; and . -- Whereas, 6,024 members of the U.S. armed forces have died in these wars; and at least 120,000 civilians have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the coalition attacks began. --Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the U.S. Conference of Mayors supports efforts to speed up the ending of these wars; and . -- Be it further resolved, that the U.S. Conference of Mayors calls on the president and the U.S. Congress to end these wars as soon as strategically possible and to bring these war dollars home to meet vital human needs, promote job creation, rebuild our infrastructure, aid municipal and state governments, and develop a new economy based upon renewable, sustainable energy.","Mayors take stand on war policy for the first time since Vietnam .

"Qanta Ahmed is the author of ""In the Land of Invisible Women: A Female Doctor's Journey in the Saudi Kingdom."" An M.D., she is an attending physician based in the Division of Pulmonary, Sleep and Critical Care Medicine at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, New York, and a fellow of the American College of Chest Physicians and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Dr. Qanta Ahmed, wearing an abbaya, says the Saudi kingdom is rejecting the subjugation of women. NEW YORK (CNN) -- A judge in Saudi Arabia has said husbands are allowed to slap their wives if they spend lavishly, a Saudi newspaper reported this past weekend. In one fell swoop, the judge debased Islam, vilified the kingdom and disregarded the ideals the Saudi monarch himself embraces. Islam is very clear on this issue: Both a husband physically chastising his wife for ""overspending"" and a judge ""upholding justice"" by sanctioning this abuse would be acting counter to Islam's ideals of compassion and justice. There is no basis in Islamic theology to support domestic abuse of any kind and specifically none pertaining to the matter of a wife's spending pattern. What is critically important to note is that the judge is flagrantly in opposition to King Abdullah's very public stance against both domestic violence and myopic clerics. The stark abasement of Islam that such a puritanical, backward-thinking judge would exact by issuing ridiculous decisions invites special scorn from the royal camp. Last year, in his annual speech marking Saudi Arabia's National Day, the king first described threats to Islam from within its ranks. Later he denounced specifically those clergy who ridicule Islam by issuing perverse fatwas. He particularly criticized the clergy who issued edicts against the owners of satellite television for airing shows thought to be salacious during Ramadan (the holy month in Islam) and, on one occasion, an especially bizarre edict focusing on Mickey Mouse. The cleric issuing these edicts was later divested of his power by King Abdullah.  Watch report on Saudi judge's comment » . In this much-feted speech, the king identified such distortions as offensive to Islamic ideals. He followed these very unambiguous statements with broader actions, replacing much of the nation's clergy in February in recent domestic reforms and installing the first female Saudi minister in the country's history. These actions send a strong signal to the increasingly calcified puritanical agents within the kingdom that their power would be successively and emphatically dismantled. Further, the monarch's concerns about the defense of women and children who are victims of domestic violence has been widely demonstrated by his enthusiastic and highly visible patronage of the National Patient Family Safety Alliance, a movement founded by Dr. Maha Al Muneef under royal patrons who are daughters of the king. In March, more than 1,600 academics from more than 30 countries convened in Riyadh at the first symposium studying domestic violence in the kingdom. Together, international academics examined, measured and evaluated the growing reports of domestic violence and child abuse in the kingdom with a view to formulating solutions. Critics complain that abuse in Saudi Arabia is increasing, but authoritative experts in the field recognize that the climate for reporting and identifying abuse has only just arrived in the kingdom, thanks in large part to the HM King Abdullah's open support and generous funding. The scale of domestic violence issues is, therefore, only just coming into focus. Why are the king's gestures so important? Because these causes relating to Saudi women have not been championed in such an aggressive manner since the time of Queen Iffat. She personally initiated mandatory education for Saudi girls in the 1960s into Saudi law, often pushing for it against the prevailing cultural norms of the time. King Abdullah has also pursued similar reforms intensely, recently laying the foundations for the largest women's university in the world, which will educate 40,000 women at a time, and installing and empowering aggressive advocates who will actively pursue reforms for Saudi womanhood in particular. While the focus of the West remains on the pervasive abbaya in the kingdom or the longstanding restriction on women driving cars in the nation's cities, uninformed outsiders fail to realize that many, many women operate unhindered by these ""restrictions."" In my time working in Saudi Arabia as an intensive care specialist, I came to learn that for most Saudi women, the abbaya is not a tool of oppression but rather one of liberation. For the observant Saudi lady who has often been raised in an environment that highly prizes securing the beauty and guarding the modesty of their womenfolk, donning abbayas allows them to work as chemical engineers at Aramaco or as fellow intensive care physicians in intensive care units at the nation's state-of-the-art hospitals. My Saudi female colleagues could therefore replace valves and fix aneurysms even if they couldn't make a three-point turn. I found them perfectly capable of managing the critically ill on mechanical ventilators and dialysis machines, all the while uncompromising of their values, maintaining their privacy in their veiled garments underneath their sterile gowns. Let us also not forget 40 percent of the wealth in Saudi Arabia is owned and controlled by women, and these women are frequently business owners and oftentimes themselves employers. Women are encouraged by Islam to maintain independent assets, assets over which men have no right or recourse even within the sanctity of marriage. For experienced kingdom watchers, it is exciting to see the outcry against the violation of human rights come from inside the kingdom, not merely from without. Women and progressive Saudi men who support them are not silenced. In fact, as observant Muslims, they are enjoined by Islam to expose any injustice, even and, in fact, especially when the infraction is committed by Muslims themselves. The judge fails on several levels: He fails the kingdom, his countrymen, his monarch and ultimately his fellow Muslims. For these failings, he should be called to task. Further, Islam demands that for Muslim women to advance their positions, rights and needs, they must gather into a cohesive social unit and mobilize. Women can demand what is fairly and rightly theirs, whether within the context of a marriage or a workplace only if they truly understand Islam, have sought out the knowledge and identified gaps in their own insight. So, in conclusion: Islam never condones slapping a wife for being ""spendthrift."" Rather it should be the judge who now needs to exercise prudence and restraint and quickly demonstrate remorse for his myopic ""Mickey Mouse Mufti"" antics. This act of stupidity unfairly depicts the kingdom as draconian at a time when the tides of progressive reform are now waist-deep and rising. Such narrow perspectives only serve to fuel global Islamophobia that has greatly increased in the West post-9/11. Muslims around the world and within the kingdom can no longer tolerate this stance, and the king, the Custodian of the Two Holy Sites of Islam, isn't likely to, either. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Qanta Ahmed.","Qanta Ahmed: Saudi judge wrongly said it's OK to slap wife for spending too much .
She says there's no basis in Islam for domestic violence of any kind .
Ahmed: Kingdom has moved to aggressively bolster the rights of women ."

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- His father, Ryan O'Neal, and sister Tatum O'Neal sat behind Redmond O'Neal in court Thursday as he entered a not guilty plea to charges he possessed heroin and an illegal handgun. The Los Angeles judge denied bond for the 26-year-old son of Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal. Redmond O'Neal was still on probation for drug convictions when he was arrested in Santa Monica, California, Tuesday morning. ""Redmond O'Neal remains cautiously optimistic that all these matters can be favorably resolved so that Mr. O'Neal can receive opportunity for additional treatment,"" his lawyer Richard Pintal told CNN after Thursday's arraignment. If convicted on the charges of felony possession of heroin and felon with a handgun, he could be sentenced to up to three years, eight months in prison, the Los Angeles County district attorney said. He could also get additional time for violating his probation. He was on probation for a 2009 drug conviction when police stopped his car for a traffic violation Tuesday morning. The officers found heroin when they searched his car with O'Neal's consent, the prosecutor said. A later search of O'Neal's apartment revealed a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, the prosecutor said. He is scheduled to return to court on August 24. O'Neal was released a year ago from a Pasadena, California, sober living facility where he was undergoing court-ordered drug rehab. Ryan O'Neal, Redmond O'Neal and half-sister Tatum O'Neal sat together for an interview on June 25, 2010, the first anniversary of Fawcett's death. Redmond O'Neal was on a day pass from the rehab center so he could visit his mother's grave for the first time. The three O'Neals were near tears as they spoke to CNN during a private gathering of friends and family at the Beverly Hills, California, headquarters of the Farrah Fawcett Foundation. ""Redmond is extremely well,"" Ryan O'Neal said. ""He is recovering from a terrible disease. He seems to have cured himself. We are thrilled about that. And that's why he's here, because they let him."" ""To show my face and let everybody know that I'm doing good, you know,"" Redmond O'Neal said. ""You can't hide forever.""

"(CNN) -- Now that they've gotten a peek at it, publishers of books, newspapers and magazines are hoping Apple's forthcoming iPad tablet device will breathe new life into their struggling industry. A handful of publishers already have struck content deals with Apple for the handheld wireless device, which displays text, photos and graphics in high-res color. Apple will launch an online bookstore to sell titles for the iPad, much like iTunes sells music for iPods and other Apple devices. ""I think it's a game-changer for us ...­ because of the ability to consume content and consume so much of it all in one place,"" Sarah Chubb, president of Condé Nast Digital, told CNN. She thinks the iPad could join Amazon's popular Kindle e-reader in boosting demand for digital media. ""It's become clear over the life of the iPhone that people love consuming information like this on their phone -- the people who buy Kindles buy more books than before they had a Kindle"" Chubb added. ""Machines like this make you want to consume more media, which is good for us."" Chubb and others are hoping that the Apple's iBookstore and other pay-based models for the iPad will do for the print-media industry what iTunes did for the music industry. ""We think there's a lot of opportunity there,"" said Adam Rothberg, vice president of corporate communications at publishing house Simon and Schuster. ""It creates a much more robust marketplace. The e-book market has clearly been growing at a really rapid clip in the last year. I think this will certainly tick it up a notch. It expands the universe of potential customers for us in a big way."" Rothberg noted the enormous reach Apple already has with consumers in the iTunes store. Through Apple's online store, Simon and Schuster may be able to reach consumers who have not already bought a Kindle, a Sony Reader or one of the other e-readers on the market. These online retail opportunities echo a debate that heated up in the late 1990s with the dawn of micropayments. ""Nobody would have believed we would pay to download music the way we do now,"" Chubb said. The idea that people might be willing to spend a dollar or so for little bits of digital content­ ­is exactly the model iTunes is based on -- and it's part of why the iPad was being hyped as revolutionary before it even launched. ""I think [Steve Jobs] will be remembered as the digital Gutenberg,"" said Bruno Ruffilli, a writer at La Stampa newspaper in Italy. ""It could be a way out of this [publishing] crisis."" Newspapers and magazine publishers have suffered financially in recent years as readers have migrated to the Web and the growth of online advertising has failed to make up for the loss of print ad revenue. Others were less enthusiastic. Jack Shafer, a columnist at Slate, wrote in December that regardless of its technical capabilities, Apple's tablet may falter like past attempts to revive print media. He cited fizzled attempts to introduce magazines on CD-ROM discs. In his column, Shafer quotes Pablo Boczkowski, a journalism professor at Northwestern University, to illustrate why the iPad isn't necessarily the golden answer to old media's problems. Ultimately, Shafer says, it's about what the consumer wants ­-- and the iPad answers a problem consumers don't have. ""Most people need a simple surfboard, rather than the complex -- and costly -- diving gear,"" Boczkowski told Shafer. One tech writer at Apple's iPad unveiling Wednesday worried that because the iPad also functions like a computer, reading on the device may be difficult. ""I'm not sure how I feel about being on the iPad and reading, because then I'm too connected,"" said Jacqui Cheng, a senior writer at the tech site Ars Technica, who believes her thoughts might be disrupted by the constant pings of e-mail. Still, publishers are experimenting with versions of their magazines for e-readers and for smartphones. And, like Conde Nast -- which publishes such magazines as Vogue, Wired and The New Yorker, see infinite possibilities for success with the iPad. Chubb noted the launch of GQ's iPhone app was widely successful in showing Conde Nast that consumers have a desire to read magazines on electronic devices. And The New Yorker is the most popular magazine download on the Kindle, she said. But the iPad has a key advantage over the Kindle, she said: The potential to bring in revenue from ads displayed on its magazine-style layouts. Said Chubb, ""There¹s no advertising opportunities within the Kindle."" Newspapers also got a hint of what the iPad might do for them during Wednesday's demo of a New York Times application for the iPad.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man accused of drugging, smothering and dismembering an 8-year-old Brooklyn boy has been deemed mentally competent to stand trial, attorneys revealed in court Thursday. Prosecutors say Levi Aron abducted the boy, Leiby Kletzky, from his Brooklyn neighborhood on July 11. The accused then took Leiby to his apartment and killed him, they contend. Aron pleaded not guilty Thursday in a Brooklyn courtroom. Aron did not enter a plea at his arraignment last month, and he was under a suicide watch. A mental evaluation that his attorneys asked be conducted on their client was revealed in court Thursday. Kings County District Attorney Charles Hynes applauded the decision. ""Now that Mr. Aron has been found fit to proceed we will move forward expeditiously to bring his case to trial. I want to reaffirm that this case will go to trial and that there are absolutely no circumstances which would lead me to accept a plea bargain,"" Hynes said. New York City's chief medical examiner said that Leiby died after being drugged and then smothered. The autopsy results for Leiby listed a cocktail of four prescription and over-the-counter drugs in the boy's system: cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant; quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug; hydrocodone, a pain medication; and acetaminophen, the drug found in Tylenol, according to the medical examiner's office. Leiby disappeared while walking home alone from summer day camp. Police located human remains in Aron's freezer during a search of the Brooklyn neighborhood as well as in a trash bin. Both Aron and Leiby are members of the borough's close-knit Orthodox Jewish community, although police say it doesn't appear that they knew each other. ""Everybody says, 'We're not going to talk about it,' but how can you not talk about it? How can you not talk about a tragedy that has affected every single family,"" Assemblyman Dov Hikind told CNN affiliate WCBS-TV. Authorities have detailed some of the evidence they allege links Aron to the kidnapping and killing -- including extensive video footage that shows Leiby talking to a man and following him to a brown car authorities later traced to Aron. Detectives later concluded that Aron was also the man they saw in the video footage. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said last month that Aron told authorities he was sorry for the trouble he has caused. Statements made by the suspect indicated that he kidnapped Leiby and, as the neighborhood search for the boy intensified, he panicked and killed him, Kelly said. ""His mental capacity is a question for the doctors,"" Hynes said. Aron's attorney at the time of his initial arraignment said he hears voices and hallucinates. ""He's been hearing voices for quite some time,"" Gerard Marrone told reporters last month, adding that Aron tries to silence the voices by listening to music. ""He listens to it with earphones and he listens to it very loud, and that helps him quell some of his voices."" Marrone has since resigned from the case. ""I have sincerest concerns about the defendant's mental state and his cognitive abilities,"" said Pierre Basile, who is representing Aron. The commissioner called the case ""heartbreaking."" ""Obviously, in this business you see a lot of violence, but there's usually some sort of irrational twisted logic that's given to why a violent event took place,"" Kelly said. ""Here, I mean, it's just, it defies all logic and I think that's what's really so, so terribly disturbing about this case. There's absolutely no reason. There's nothing more innocent than an 8-year-old child."" On the day he disappeared, Leiby was supposed to meet his parents after walking seven blocks from day camp, but he became lost and asked the suspect for directions, Kelly said. Surveillance video showed Aron entering a dentist's office while Leiby waited for him across the street for seven minutes, Kelly said. Aron claims he took Leiby to a wedding in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said. Police said Aron went to the wedding, but they have not been able to confirm that Leiby went with him, as no one has said they saw him. According to Kelly, police showed up at Aron's third-floor attic apartment at 2:40 a.m. July 13 and asked him about Leiby's whereabouts. The suspect pointed them to the kitchen, where blood was visible on the freezer handle. Inside the refrigerator was a cutting board with three blood-spattered carving knives, Kelly said. Remains were found in Aron's freezer and in a trash bin more than two miles away, wrapped in a black plastic garbage bag inside a suitcase, Kelly said. Aron was a clerk at a maintenance supply company, authorities said. His only known criminal summons was for urinating in public last year. CNN's Jesse Solomon, Nina Raja, Nina Golgowski and Leigh Remizowski contributed to this report.","Levi Aron has been accused of drugging, smothering and dismembering Brooklyn boy .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The number of deaths in Sudan's Darfur region since 2006 may have been underestimated by as much as 50 percent, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs said Tuesday. An man injured in clashes with tribal fighters outside the African Union Mission in southern Darfur in 2007. In March, international figures, including U.N. data, put the death toll in Darfur at 200,000, with another 2.5 million people displaced. But 300,000 are believed to have died in the tribal conflict in the past two years, said John Holmes, who also is the United Nations emergency relief coordinator. Holmes said that sexual violence has increased and that food allotments for civilians affected by the civil war will be halved in a few days. Holmes gave the U.N. Security Council an update on conditions in the western Sudan region, revisiting a report he gave a year ago. ""I am sad to say that the humanitarian situation remains as grim today as it was then, if not more so,"" he said. In 2008, 100,000 civilians have fled their homes, many not for the first time. The Darfur conflict began five years ago, when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms, complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government. Sudan's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing tribal militias known as Janjaweed, which are said to have committed the worst atrocities against Darfur's local communities. There also have been intra-rebel and tribal clashes, Holmes added. He blamed the military arm of the Justice and Equality Movement faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement for the most recent round of violence, and he accused the government of using ""disproportionate force"" and failing to differentiate between civilians and rebels in their response. ""Darfur today is still characterized by insecurity, lawlessness and impunity,"" he said. ""A particularly worrying feature is evidence of high levels of sexual violence and exploitation in the northern corridor of west Darfur over the past two months."" This is shown by the increased number of women and girls seeking treatment after sexual brutality, Holmes said. The World Food Programme announced last week that it will have to cut back its food distributions in May, partly because of attacks on convoys that reduced the amount of supplies they can get through, Holmes said. Six aid workers have been killed this year, and 42 humanitarian posts have been attacked. The supply line also is hurt by soaring food prices: The price of staples such as millet has doubled since April 2007, Holmes said. While expressing gratitude to the Sudanese government for improved cooperation under various agreements, Holmes said there still is no physical access to internally displaced persons and some other groups. He said he was ""saddened and angry"" that after five years, there has been no lasting solution to the suffering. He made several recommendations to the government, including disbanding the Janjaweed, providing security for citizens, ending impunity for criminals and shouldering more of the financial burden for humanitarian aid. Holmes also said rebels must stop their attacks against people and humanitarian convoys. E-mail to a friend .","In March, death toll in Darfur given as 200,000; 2.5 million people displaced .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Mason Jennings is free of drugs or alcohol. Has been for some time now. But danger still lurks in his music. Rolling Stone recently dubbed Mason Jennings ""one of the best songwriters you've never heard of."" Effortless melody, dexterous wordplay, tight compositions -- they come easy for Jennings, whom Rolling Stone recently dubbed ""one of the best songwriters you've never heard of."" But his new album, ""Blood of Man"" (Brushfire), goes deeper than his previous work, which presented a more affable side of the Honolulu-born, Minneapolis-based singer-songwriter. At a recent show in Los Angeles, Jennings told the crowd that he had to tell his mother about a couple of songs on ""Blood of Man."" ""There might be some painful memories in there,"" he warned. His mother responded, ""Well, I'll be writing a song called 'My Son Stole My Car and Got Stoned and Drunk.' "" ""Blood of Man"" is raw and personal, Jennings allowed in an interview. ""I got to a place where I made music that moved me,"" he said. ""When I play with that kind of openness ... I know I can get free.""  Watch a music video of Mason Jennings » . ""I think it has to do with wanting transcendence,"" he said at another point. ""Everybody is looking for a feeling of release, and my release comes through my music."" CNN sat down with Mason Jennings in a Los Angeles recording studio. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: This record is getting the best reviews of your career. Reaction? Mason Jennings: It's surprising. [For] this one, I didn't even think about other people. What would I like to do? If no one is going to hear this, what would it sound like? So I was just recording tons of songs in the winter by myself, and I ended up putting out what I had done. I thought there would be no reviews or people would just ignore it. So it's great to have this kind of reaction [to the album]. CNN: The title ""Blood of Man"" can mean many things ... Jennings: I was actually a little embarrassed by it. Kind of intense and pretty dark, but in the end, there was no other option. To me, it's about humanness -- dark and light -- instinctual humanness. There's just life blood coming through it. CNN: You mentioned darkness. On the album, we have ""black wind blowing"" and ""lonely roads"" and ""suicide halls."" Are you speaking from personal experience? Jennings: [It was] letting myself feel anger, desire, fear ... all those human things inside you. Trusting that it's OK to put them out there. Trusting more about what resonates with me rather than trying to steer the songs to safer waters. CNN: Were there parts of yourself that you hadn't really mined to this point? Jennings: Yes. The song ""Pittsburgh"" draws from experiences I had growing up that triggered a lot of different things. It's a rough period for everybody, but I had a lot of different experiences that were kind of ... difficult. I started writing about those, and it started feeling more like a diary or my own expression [as opposed to] some of my other stuff where I tend to be more ""in character."" CNN: How did your newfound practice of meditation affect ""Blood of Man""? Jennings: I would think that if you go that inward that even more demons would come up, but it was the opposite. I started doing a lot of yoga, pretty intensely, right when I started recording these songs. So I have a feeling that it was a big part of getting into my body -- getting physical and connecting with my spirit and allowing me to get free. It was a big part of this record, strangely, because [the record] is so dark and raw, but the whole time I [knew] I could handle it. CNN: The song ""Blood of Man"" seems like a centerpiece. Jennings: When I was doing these recordings, I was sending them to a couple of producers to see what they thought of the ideas. Most of the time they were asking me how I recorded this or that and how I got [certain sounds]. I thought ""Maybe this is OK just how it is."" I didn't have that one final song that tied it all together, and I was so excited about the idea that I was going to release everything [as is] and that song just came to me and really hit me hard. It's one of my favorite songs. That song feels like something I've been trying to do for years. It captures the feeling I had the whole time I was writing this album. CNN: I could see where a producer would take these songs and add strings, make it gloss, but it works the way it is. Jennings: A lot of people want to clean up my sound. They want to take the rough edges off, and whenever I've tried that -- to hear my voice in that context ... it doesn't sound good. It sounds out of place, like having a barn animal walk into a fancy room. Whenever I try to work too hard on [a song] and force it...it doesn't [sound right]. But then I write a song like ""City of Ghosts,"" and it's like a punch. It's [quick], and it's done. CNN: It can't be calculated. Jennings: Got have to that tape rolling. And the other thing is [to] make sure you stay inspired by life. Keep that sense of wonder.","Mason Jennings' new CD, ""Blood of Man,"" is very personal .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate voted Wednesday to approve the new nuclear arms control treaty with Russia -- a major foreign policy victory for the Obama administration near the end of the lame-duck session of Congress. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, was cleared by a 71-26 vote. Several Republicans joined a unified Democratic caucus in support of the accord. Under Senate rules, the treaty required support from a two-thirds majority of voting senators for final approval. ""This is the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades,"" President Barack Obama said after the vote.  It ""will enhance our leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the peace of a world without them."" Bipartisan passage of the measure ""sends a powerful signal to the world that Republicans and Democrats stand together on behalf of our security."" If ratified, the treaty would resume inspections of each country's nuclear arsenal while limiting both the United States and Russia to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers.  It still needs to be approved by the Russian parliament. Obama signed the treaty with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in April.  The accord is considered a critical component of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and the administration's attempt to ""reset"" Washington's relationship with Moscow. Several senators were reassured by the last-minute passage of an amendment stating that the accord should not be interpreted in a way that would hamper U.S. missile defense plans. The amendment was sponsored by Republican senators John McCain of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, among others. Others said they had been assured of an administration commitment to modernize America's aging nuclear arsenal. ""The people of the world are watching us, because they rely on our leadership,"" said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts.  It is time to ""move the world a little more out of the dark shadow of nuclear nightmare."" ""We are the leading nuclear power on this earth.  It is our responsibility to lead,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota.  This treaty is ""a step in the right direction."" Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, called it a step forward in terms of constraining ""expensive arms competition with Russia"" and frustrating ""rogue nations who would prefer as much distance as possible between the United States and Russia."" Not all Republicans were convinced of the treaty's merits, however. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, argued on the Senate floor that the basic premise of the treaty -- that America's nuclear arsenal should be at parity with Russia's -- is flawed. ""Russia is a protector of none and a threat to many. America is a protector of many and a threat to none,"" DeMint said. DeMint also voiced an ongoing conservative complaint in the lame-duck session -- that Democrats were ramming the treaty through as part of a long list of partisan priorities rejected by the public in the midterm elections. ""We should not be passing major legislation at this time of year with this Congress,"" he said. The arms pact is part of ""a continued effort of accommodation and appeasement"" that makes a ""mockery of the debate and ratification process."" Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, called the treaty ""an echo from the 20th century"" that fails to account for new and emerging threats.  Kirk and several other senators expressed a fear that the treaty would weaken America's ability to prevent potential nuclear attacks from countries such as Iran and North Korea. McCain himself, despite passage of the amendment he sponsored, ultimately voted against the accord, as well. He argued that that it ""re-establishes an old and outdated linkage between nuclear arms and missile defense, which is no longer suited to the threats of today's world."" Passage of the treaty appeared to be in doubt for weeks. A late burst of support came Tuesday, however, after treaty supporters voted down or tabled several Republican amendments, saying they were unnecessary and would imperil the pact by reopening negotiated language or understandings with Russia. The defeated amendments included adding a reference to tactical nuclear weapons and a bid to remove from the preamble language recognizing a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons. A number of senior military leaders publicly endorsed the treaty, including Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""This treaty has the full support of your uniformed military, and we all support its ratification,"" Mullen wrote in a letter read Monday by Kerry. The late endorsement helped undercut a move by some conservatives to delay final consideration of the treaty until January, when Republicans will have a stronger minority in the Senate and, therefore, more leverage. Obama and Democratic leaders, conversely, pushed strongly to get the agreement passed before their majority in the Senate diminishes. In a sign of the high stakes involved, Obama and other top administration officials, including Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, all talked to individual senators in recent days to seek support for the treaty. Biden, acting in his capacity as president of the Senate, personally presided over the final vote. Clinton also went to Capitol Hill to discuss the issue with former Senate colleagues. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, managed to make it to the Senate for the vote despite undergoing prostate cancer surgery Monday. A joyous atmosphere was seen on the floor after the vote -- likely the last Senate action of the lame-duck session. The treaty's supporters and opponents alike congratulated Lugar and Kerry, the key congressional proponents of the accord. An overwhelming majority of Americans support ratification of the treaty, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday: 73 percent of people questioned in the national poll said the Senate should approve the accord, while 24 percent said senators should reject it. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Tom Cohen, Dana Bash, Ted Barrett and Lesa Jansen contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama praises unity between parties in passing nuclear arms accord .

"(CNN) -- A powerful storm system that ripped through the Louisville, Kentucky, area left thousands of people without power and forced the closing of the internationally famous Churchill Downs racetrack on Thursday. The National Weather Service said damage from the Wednesday night system, which also struck the University of Louisville campus, likely resulted from tornadoes. However, Weather Service meteorologist Ryan Sharp said that cannot be confirmed until a storm survey is completed later Thursday. A storm survey confirmed that an F-1 tornado touched down in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, east of Louisville, according to the National Weather Service.  The tornado uprooted trees and blew debris across short distances, but no injuries or fatalities occurred, according to the survey. A separate survey was still on-going in the Churchill Downs area, said the Weather Service. The storms also spawned flash floods that left two motorists stranded in their cars amid the rising waters, according to CNN-affiliate WAVE.  They were rescued by firefighters, the Louisville television station reported. About 8,500 customers lost electricity, according to Louisville-Jefferson County emergency officials. In a statement early Thursday, Churchill Downs announced that the horse track would be closed all day for racing and training because of damage left behind by the storm. However, the track's training facility, Trackside Louisville, was not damaged and will remain open, the statement read. Churchill Downs also said it had contacted the Red Cross about finding temporary shelter for 100 stable-area workers whose living quarters ""were damaged or compromised by the strong winds."" Churchill Downs is home to the Kentucky Derby. ""Nine barns suffered significant damage as a result of the storm, which reportedly produced tornadoes in the metro Louisville area,"" the statement read. Churchill Downs spokesman Darren Rogers said no one was injured, including any of the 1,400 horses stabled at the facility. However, track officials early Thursday were preparing to relocate as many as 150 horses. Rogers said the horses may need to be moved because of the possibility that the storm had left nails on the ground, which could injure the animals. Buddy Rogers, a spokesman for the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management said his agency had not received reports of injuries at the racetrack or elsewhere. CNN's Ben Smith contributed to this report.","Churchill Downs racetrack is closed because of storm damage .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Sunday that any controversy over his remarks last week that Israel-Palestinian negotiations should start from pre-1967 borders and include land swaps was ""not based in substance."" In his first speech as president to the main American-Israeli advocacy group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Obama sought to reassure the vital U.S. Jewish lobby of his administration's commitment to Israel's security while also making clear his desire to kick-start the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at a time when the entire Middle East landscape is changing amid the so-called Arab Spring demonstrations. Obama acknowledged that he expected some controversy from his call last Thursday for negotiations to be based on border demarcations from before the six-day war of 1967, in which Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza Strip and other territory. Got questions about the peace process? Share a short video . However, he said, his policy on the border issue ""means that the parties themselves -- Israelis and Palestinians -- will negotiate a border that is different than the one that existed on June 4, 1967,"" the eve of the war. Those negotiations will involve ""mutually agreed-upon"" land swaps to deal with changing conditions of recent decades, he said. ""That's what mutually agreed-upon swaps means. It is a well-known formula to all who have worked on this issue for a generation,"" Obama said to applause. ""It allows the parties themselves to account for the changes that have taken place over the last 44 years,"" including the new demographic realities on the ground and the needs of both sides. His proposal contained ""nothing particularly original,"" he said, adding that ""this basic framework for negotiations has long been the basis for discussions among the parties, including previous U.S. administrations."" ""If there is a controversy, then, it's not based in substance,"" Obama said. The Thursday remarks drew a chilly response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who used a joint appearance with Obama on Friday to reject any possibility that Israel could return to its pre-1967 borders. Netanyahu said such borders would be ""indefensible"" and noted that major Israeli population centers now lie outside them. On Sunday, a statement by Netanyahu responding to Obama's AIPAC speech was more conciliatory, saying: ""I share the president's will to promote peace and I value his current and past efforts to achieve this goal."" ""I am determined to act together with President Obama in order to find ways to resume the negotiations for peace,"" Netanyahu's statement said. ""Peace is a vital need for all of us."" Maen Areikat, the chief Palestinian representative to the United States, told CNN on Sunday that his Palestine Liberation Organization also welcomed the U.S. support for restarting the peace talks. At the same time, Areikat called for concrete steps by Israel that showed ""they are genuine and sincere about the ending the conflict with us,"" instead of what he labeled ""nationalist, ideological"" slogans and steps such as continuing to expand housing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In his speech Sunday, Obama repeated a line from Thursday that the ""status quo"" in the Israel-Palestinian conflict is unsustainable. He listed a series of reasons why conditions on the ground dictated the need for a revitalized peace effort now. ""First, the number of Palestinians living west of the Jordan River is growing rapidly and fundamentally reshaping the demographic realities of both Israel and the Palestinian Territories,"" Obama said. ""This will make it harder and harder -- without a peace deal -- to maintain Israel as both a Jewish state and a democratic state."" He also cited the increasing difficulty for Israel to defend itself against regional enemies, and the ""new generation"" of Arabs reshaping the entire region through the protest movement that already has toppled governments in Tunisia and Egypt. ""A just and lasting peace can no longer be forged with one or two Arab leaders. Going forward, millions of Arab citizens have to see that peace is possible for that peace to be sustained,"" Obama said, adding that a growing regional and international impatience with the Israel-Palestinian peace process is leading some to look for other options, such as a U.N. resolution in September to recognize an independent Palestinian state. Even though such a U.N. General Assembly resolution would be non-binding, Obama told the AIPAC meeting that the United States would oppose any effort to isolate Israel in international forums. He also repeated U.S. criticism of Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs the Gaza Strip and is considered a terrorist organization by Washington. Hamas and the other main Palestinian group, the Fatah party of Mahmoud Abbas that heads the governing authority in the West Bank, agreed on May 4 to work together to set up unifying elections in May 2012. Areikat said that under the agreement, Fatah would continue to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians until they can elect their own leaders and representatives next year. ""Hopefully, come May 2012, the Palestinian people will be able to choose those people who are committed to negotiating a peaceful resolution with Israel,"" Areikat said, conceding that Hamas would be a voice in any Palestinian unity government that emerges from next year's vote. Obama said Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with Hamas until it renounces violence and recognizes Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. The audience applauded loudly when Obama called for Hamas to release Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured five years ago. In response, Hamas Spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told CNN that the U.S. government has ""a clear preference for Israel"" at the expense of freedom for the Palestinian people and their right to establish a sovereign state. In the United States, political opponents criticized Obama for what they described as harming Israel's negotiating position with the Palestinians. Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich labeled the Obama policy a ""disaster"" and ""extraordinarily dangerous"" in an appearance Sunday on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""A president who can't control his own border probably shouldn't lecture Israel about their border,"" Gingrich said. While a few boos and groans were heard in the AIPAC crowd when Obama raised the border issue Sunday, he received consistent applause throughout the speech and a vigorous standing ovation at the end. In Israel, about 150 right-wing activists protested Sunday against Obama's policy in front of the American Embassy in Tel Aviv, with some bearing slogans that declared: ""Obama, Israelis are not willing to commit suicide.""","NEW: A Palestinian official calls for sincere steps from Israel .

"Washington (CNN) -- An oft-repeated statement that the Federal Aviation Administration's partial shutdown has forced the layoff of 70,000 construction workers is, at best, an over-simplification, and at worst, an exaggeration, according to the expert behind the number. Democratic leaders, and even some Republicans, quoted the 70,000 number frequently this week to emphasize the serious consequences of the shutdown. But George Mason University professor Stephen Fuller, whose 3-year-old study was used by others to arrive at the 70,000 figure, said the estimate includes everything from actual construction workers, who were laid off, to drug store clerks and restaurant waitresses, who might see ""a tiny bit less revenue flow."" The true number of laid-off construction workers is probably one-third of that figure, Fuller told CNN. The rampant use -- and misuse -- of the 70,000 figure is a study in the wondrous ways of Washington, where facts and figures frequently enter the public debate filled with nuance and caveats, all of which are rapidly abandoned in the blazing heat of partisan battle. The 70,000 figure entered the public sphere when the FAA turned to Associated General Contractors of America, a construction industry group, to calculate the economic impact of the FAA funding impasse. The FAA had halted more than 200 construction projects totaling $2.5 billion. AGC dusted off the 3-year-old study conducted by Fuller. His research, designed to show the ""multiplier effect"" of the president's stimulus package, concluded in early 2009 that $1 billion in nonresidential construction created or supported 28,500 jobs and added $3.4 billion to the Gross Domestic Product. An AGC economist applied Fuller's formula to the FAA's $2.5 billion construction halt and came to the conclusion that it would put ""24,000 construction workers out of work."" Another 11,000 workers in related businesses ""are also affected,"" the AGC said, and ""as many as 35,000 jobs will be undermined in the broader economy, from the lunch wagon near the job site to the truck dealership across town."" The total number impacted -- in ways large and small -- was 70,000, the AGC said. In a subsequent Department of Transportation news releases and statements, the information was abbreviated, losing much of its important nuance. ""AGC estimates that 70,000 construction workers and workers in related fields have been affected,"" the DOT reported in one news release. A DOT media advisory blurred the picture stating flatly ""70,000 construction workers and workers in related fields have been laid off."" The number lost even more clarity on Monday, when Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood appeared at a news conference near one shutdown construction project. ""Seventy thousand construction workers are out of work today -- 70,000! -- and here we are right smack dab in the middle of the construction season in America,"" LaHood said. (In a slip of the tongue, LaHood also misstated the purpose of the LaGuardia airport project. ""This tower needs to be built,"" he said, gesturing towards a control tower that is being demolished.) Others also cited the 70,000 figure. ""More than 70,000 construction jobs around the country... are on hold,"" Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, said in a written statement. Some apparently added the nearly 4,000 FAA employees who have been furloughed to the total. The dispute is ""keeping 74,000 people from working,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday. Some apparently rounded up. ""Seventy-five thousand people are now over the precipice,"" Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said at a Wednesday news conference. ""We have 80,000 jobs at least on the line,"" said Majority Leader Harry Reid at one briefing Tuesday. (President Obama, in comments Wednesday, fudged, referring to ""tens of thousands of construction workers being suspended..."") On Wednesday, the AFL-CIO Executive Council got into the action. In a news release, it said House Republicans ""jeopardized 90,000 airport construction jobs."" Two sentences later, it went for the brass ring: ""Congress must (act) to preserve almost 100,000 American jobs,"" it said. ACG spokesman Brian Turmail, a former government spokesman, said he believes the politicians' misstatements were innocent in nature. ""I don't have any impression that people are manipulating the numbers, but events are moving so fast that everyone needs to take a deep breath and make sure that we're all working with the same data,"" he said. ""I think everyone's frustrated that we're in the predicament."" ""I'd just want to stress that we have been very careful to explain in all our communications that the 70,000 figure reflects the broader impact of halting airport construction jobs across the country,"" Turmail said. Fuller, meanwhile, says the FAA should be able to release the actual number of laid off construction workers, making estimates unnecessary. The 70,000 number, while hard to wrap one's head around, still might strike some at the FAA as questionably large. It is well above the total number of employees in the agency, which stands at about 47,500.","Union used the number to indicate ""the broader impact of halting airport construction jobs""
The true number of laid-off workers is probably one-third of that figure, expert says .

"New York (CNN) -- Celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson is a gastronomic tour de force. The Ethiopian-born chef has won three coveted James Beard Awards, an accolade described as ""like winning the Olympic gold medal for chefs,"" and has been celebrated as one of ""The Great Chefs of America"" by the Culinary Institute of America. With three restaurants and cookbooks to his name, Samuelsson, 39, is firmly established in the world of haute cuisine, so it was no surprise that he was chosen to cook for President Barack Obama's first White House state dinner. The dinner featured a seasonal menu reflecting American and Indian flavors in honor of the visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Samuelsson worked with first lady Michelle Obama to create a menu that included potato and eggplant salad, roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, chickpeas and okra, green curry prawns and caramelized salsify with smoked collard greens. It's been a whirlwind rise to the top for the chef who says he developed an interest in cooking at just six years old. But life has not always been easy for him or his family. Born Kassahun Tsegie in a small village north of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Samuelsson was three years old when he, his older sister and mother contracted tuberculosis during an epidemic in Ethiopia. Admitted to hospital, Samuelsson and his sister Linda survived, but his mother was killed by the disease. After their mother's death, a nurse took pity on the young siblings and found an adoption agency to register them, Samuelsson told CNN.   Blog: Meeting Marcus Samuelsson . Months later, Swedish couple Anne Marie and Lennart Samuelsson adopted the children and they left Ethiopia for a life in Europe, which at times proved radically different for them. Looking back on his upbringing, Samuelsson said: ""My mother was white, my father was white, we were mixed kids, mixed family. It was the norm, you know. Not until maybe you're in your teens do you really start reflecting on that maybe that's not the norm."" It was only later in life when his sister started to dig into the family history that Samuelsson discovered his biological father in Ethiopia was still alive. Samuelsson told CNN: ""We found him and my step brothers and sisters. This is one of my biggest gifts to have met my birth father and my sisters and brothers and I feel extremely connected to them. ""My father knew we were adopted. He knew that we were in Sweden but he just didn't know where,"" he added. It was in his adoptive home that Samuelsson's love of cooking was shaped and developed by his grandmother. He would spend hours in the kitchen with her and by the age of 16 had decided to become a world-class chef. He attended the Culinary Institute in Gothenburg, and then worked in Switzerland, Austria and France before moving to the United States in 1991 where he was employed as an apprentice at acclaimed Scandinavian restaurant ""Aquavit"" in New York. This was to be his launch pad to culinary fame. After four years at ""Aquavit,"" at the age of just 24, Samuelsson was promoted to Executive Chef and his career skyrocketed. Fifteen years on, Samuelsson has created his own brand, with three restaurants and a collection of cooking books and classes to his name. It's been hard work but Samuelsson credits his success to his origins. He told CNN: ""I always feel like the biggest luxury I have is that I am connected to poverty. I come from a clay house in the country in Addis. No water, no electricity, no nothing ... I think it is my responsibility to represent poverty. Talk about it and also show there's lots of happy togetherness, family and love."" Susannah Palk contributed to this article .","Samuelsson was adopted at the age of three .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China's job outlook is ""grim,"" and the global financial crisis could cause more layoffs and more labor unrest until the country's economic stimulus package kicks in next year, the nation's minister of human resources and social security said Thursday. Thousands of graduates crowd a jobs fair in Nanjing but vacancies are becoming harder to find. The stimulus package, unveiled earlier this month, will pump $585 billion into rebuilding communities destroyed by the May earthquake, constructing railways, housing, airports and highways, and funding other projects. China is most concerned about the growing labor unrest, the human resources minister, Yin Weimin, said at a news conference. The increase in unrest has paralleled the increase of business and factory closings and job losses. Yin noted that in the past two months, some businesses, mainly smaller ones, have been forced to close or suspend production. Several hundred taxi drivers went on strike Wednesday in Chongqing, in southwestern China, after the government said it planned to put more cabs on the district's roads, thereby increasing competition, the Gansu Daily newspaper said . And about 2,000 people rioted Monday in the impoverished northwestern province of Gansu over plans to move Longnan's city government offices, which were damaged in the May 12 Sichuan earthquake, to a nearby county. Residents, fearing the change would reduce their property values and threaten their livelihoods, clashed with police and looted government offices, the Gansu Daily reported. China's manufacturing sector, which produced 14 percent of the clothing, toys and footwear imported into the United States last year, has decelerated rapidly over the past few months, pulled down by a pair of factors. First, the global economic slowdown and the subsequent drop in consumer spending stymied demand for discretionary goods made in China. Second, Chinese manufacturers are battling rising labor and material costs at the same time that the yuan's rising value versus the dollar is making Chinese exports to the United States and elsewhere more expensive. Because of these challenges, more than 65,000 Chinese factories have gone bankrupt this year, said Lan Hailin, professor of business strategy with the South China University of Technology in Guangzhou, China. And as overseas orders continue to shrink, he thinks the number of bankruptcies will keep rising. The urban unemployment rate through October this year was 4 percent, lower than the government's projection of 4.5 percent. But Yin said Thursday the jobless numbers do not include migrant rural workers -- probably the most-affected group -- because they move so frequently. There are about 150 million migrant laborers in China, mostly in cities. Xinhua said Yin has predicted unemployment will rise in the first quarter of 2009. After that, he said, the stimulus package and other steps China has taken to boost the financial sector should boost employment, according to Xinhua. China hopes the growth of jobs will then cool down the protests. Until then, China is bracing for more demonstrations. Meng Jianzhu, minister of public security, was quoted by the BBC as warning police this week to be ""fully aware of the challenges brought by the global financial crisis."" He said officers should be careful about how they handle ""mass incidents.""","China warns of labor unrest and more layoffs during economic crisis .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The person who leaked British lawmakers' controversial expense claims earlier this year, triggering a national scandal, was motivated by outrage at apparent equipment shortages for British troops, a newspaper said Friday. The mole was angry at apparent equipment shortages for British troops deployed around the world. The mole was one of 20 people employed to process and censor the expenses claims before their scheduled official release in July, according to The Daily Telegraph. The man leaked the claims to the Telegraph, which printed them in a series of front-page articles in May. The articles brought public embarrassment to Parliament and even forced some lawmakers to resign. The 20 employees going through the claims were guarded by British soldiers to ensure nothing was leaked. The soldiers were working there in between tours of duty in order to earn extra money to pay for badly needed military equipment, the Telegraph said. One of the soldiers had taken on the temporary work to earn enough money to buy a lightweight Kevlar protective vest similar to the ones used by U.S. troops, while another soldier was trying to earn money for desert boots, gloves, and sunglasses, the Telegraph said. Hearing the soldiers' stories while at the same time looking through what were revealed as excessive claims made by lawmakers, prompted the mole to take action, the newspaper said. ""It's not easy to watch footage on the television news of a coffin draped in a Union Jack and then come in to work the next day and see on your computer screen what (members of Parliament) are taking for themselves,"" the mole told the Telegraph. ""Hearing from the serving soldiers about how they were having to work there to earn enough money to buy themselves decent equipment, while the MPs could find public money to buy themselves all sorts of extravagances, only added to the feeling that the public should know what was going on."" Watch report on what prompted outrage » . The Telegraph does not name the man who leaked the claims. He tells his story in a book, ""No Expenses Spared,"" released Friday about the scandal written by two Telegraph reporters. Speaking in the book, the mole says he is ""bloody glad"" he released the information, but is disappointed in the reaction from lawmakers so far. Controversial claims detailed by the newspaper included thousands of dollars' worth of interest on a mortgage that had already been paid, money spent to clean a moat on a country estate, and more than $1,000 spent on a small house on a pond for ducks. More than a dozen members of Parliament caught up in the scandal promised to step down in the next election. It led Prime Minister Gordon Brown to reshuffle his Cabinet and forced the speaker of the House of Commons to resign, the first time that had happened since 1695. Claims for allowances for second homes -- which most lawmakers have because they need to be in London for parliamentary business -- were a big point of controversy. The Telegraph exposed how some lawmakers ""flipped"" the designation of their main and second homes to avoid taxes or make big allowance claims. Many lawmakers defended their claims as being within the rules. But even where that was the case, the public criticized lawmakers for greed and for taking advantage. The reports forced the government to release the claims in June, a month earlier than planned. But unlike the information revealed by the Telegraph, the officially released documents were redacted, with key details blocked from view. Parliament said the edits were made to protect the security and privacy of lawmakers, their staffs and third parties. The issue of equipment shortages for British troops has been simmering for years. Some relatives of fallen soldiers have blamed their loved ones' deaths on a lack of proper gear in the battlefield. This month, the widow and father-in-law of Sjt. Paul McAleese, killed by a bomb in Afghanistan, said the soldier had voiced concerns about safety conditions at his base in Wishtan. The father-in-law, Stephen Minter, wrote a letter to Brown detailing what he believed to be a lack of equipment for British troops. In July, Sasha Buckley, the childhood sweetheart of Rifleman Daniel Hume, who was killed in Afghanistan, voiced the same concerns to the Daily Mail newspaper. ""The real tragedy is that he won't be the last soldier killed out there,"" she told the paper. ""There will be many more coming home unless the government give them the support they need. That means more equipment now -- soldiers like Dan deserve better."" The Ministry of Defence has maintained that soldiers are properly equipped. In a statement Friday, a ministry spokesman said providing the best equipment for British troops is the top priority. ""Every soldier who deploys to Afghanistan receives Osprey body armor and a Mark 6a helmet,"" the spokesman said in a statement. ""They also receive a black bag containing all their operational requirements. Valued at £3,500 ($5,600), it contains everything a soldier will need from boots and socks to camel backs (strap-on water bottles). Commanders now have a variety of helicopters, protected patrol vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles and other key equipments at their disposal, and we are committed to ensuring that their needs are met, both in the short and long term. Since 2006, we have delivered equipment valued at more than 10 billion pounds ($16 billion) to the armed forces.""","Mole one of 20 people employed to process and censor MPs' expenses .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law Monday a peace deal for the nation's violence-plagued Swat Valley, according to a presidential spokesman. Women wearing burqas in North West Frontier Province. The deal implements Islamic law, or sharia, in the Swat Valley region of North West Frontier Province. Last week, pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Mohammad announced he was pulling out of a peace deal for Swat Valley, saying the government was not serious about implementing Islamic law, or sharia, in the region. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Saturday the peace deal remained intact. Mohammad brokered a cease-fire in February between the Pakistani government and his son-in-law, Maulana Fazlullah, who commands the Taliban in Swat Valley. Although details of the deal were not immediately available, it was understood that the area will come under the Taliban's strict interpretation of sharia. The central government has little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July 2008 to flush out militants from areas of the North West Frontier Province. As retaliation for the military presence, the Taliban carried out a series of deadly attacks, beheadings and destruction of girls' schools. They also continued to gain ground, setting up checkpoints throughout the area. Pakistan is under enormous pressure to control the militants within its borders. The militants are blamed for launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan, where U.S. and NATO forces are fighting militants. Swat Valley was once one of Pakistan's biggest tourist destinations. It is near the Afghanistan border and is 186 miles (300 kilometers) from the capital, Islamabad.","Presidential spokesman says deal gives sharia law a role in Swat Valley .

"(CNN) -- An emperor penguin discovered thousands of kilometers away from Antarctica with a bellyful of sand is recovering after an endoscopy Monday, a New Zealand zoo official said. The procedure removed ""much of the gunk that was in his stomach,"" including ""rocks, sticks and stones,"" said Dr. Lisa Argilla, manager of veterinary science at Wellington Zoo, where the bird was taken for treatment. The penguin has also been passing sand. The penguin -- whose gender is unknown pending DNA test results -- stunned passers-by last week when it showed up at a beach north of Wellington. ""This is only the second time an emperor penguin has been seen in New Zealand,"" said Kate Baker, spokeswoman for the Wellington Zoo. Even more surprising was what the zoo found inside the penguin -- enough sand to fill its stomach and esophagus. ""In Antarctica, they normally eat ice to cool down and to hydrate,"" Baker said. It's possible the bird mistook or tried to substitute the sand for snow or ice. It's unclear why the penguin apparently swam more than 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) from Antarctica. Argilla said the bird might have gotten lost in a current, or perhaps its internal radar went awry. New Zealanders have dubbed the penguin ""Happy Feet,"" a reference to the 2006 animated movie about emperor penguins. But those at the Wellington Zoo are steering clear of giving the bird a name. ""We get very fond of our patients. If you start naming them, it's really hard if the worst were to happen,"" Argilla said. The bird has undergone multiple stomach flushes, but getting all the sand out remains a challenge, Argilla said. ""Having sand in your stomach is very serious,"" she said. ""It can cause a rupture, that's my main concern. ... I would assume the sand has abraded the stomach lining."" Hundreds of zoo visitors watched the endoscopy Monday and heard live commentary during the procedure. Argilla said emperor penguins normally eat rocks to help them digest, ""but he went way overboard. I think he mistook it for snow to cool him off."" The zoo currently has four little blue penguins, which are native in New Zealand, Baker said. All have been rehabilitated; one is missing an eye, and one is missing a flipper. But taking care of an emperor penguin is an entirely different story. The bird's temporary quarters include air conditioning set as cold as possible and shaved ice to help the emperor stay cool. Keeping the bird at the zoo permanently isn't feasible. Not only would building an exhibit to house an emperor penguin be extremely expensive, the wild bird is ""a very social animal. We would need more (penguins),"" Argilla said. Argilla said the top priority is helping the bird recover. If all goes well, representatives from the Wellington zoo, New Zealand's Department of Conservation and other experts will decide where the penguin should go. Argilla said she hopes the bird will be able to return to the wild. In the meantime, the penguin has garnered widespread attention and sympathy. ""I think people have a real soft spot for penguins,"" Argilla said. ""Everyone feels really sorry for him. He's just so lost."" CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","New Zealanders spot an emperor penguin 3,000 kilometers from its habitat .

"(CNN) -- The W Austin hotel is closing indefinitely after glass fell from the balcony panels of the Austin, Texas, building for a second day in a row and the third time in recent weeks, the hotel's parent company announced Tuesday. The hotel will be closed ""until further notice"" as the glass panels are replaced, the hotel's parent company said in a statement Tuesday. Guests of the hotel are being relocated to other hotels. ""We are replacing every piece of balcony glass on the building,"" Stratus Properties CEO Beau Armstrong said in the statement. The incident occurred the same day a lawsuit was filed against the hotel on behalf of two people who were injured June 10 when glass from a broken panel rained down on them in the hotel pool, CNN affiliate KXAN-TV reported. According to the lawsuit, the hotel had been warned of the problem before the incident but failed to respond, KXAN reported. Just after 5 p.m. Tuesday, three panels fell from the south side of the building, a day after panels fell on cars parked below on 3rd Street, KXAN reported. The W Hotel in midtown Atlanta was the site of a fatal accident on May 28, when two women crashed through a 10-floor window and one fell to her death. According to a preliminary investigation, the friends were ""play fighting"" when they smashed into the window and fell. In the days following that incident, an Atlanta police spokesman said in a statement officers were not looking at the glass in the windows as a factor and had ""no reason to believe this was anything other than a tragic accident."" In a statement Tuesday, W Austin stressed that the Austin and Atlanta incidents were ""completely unrelated."" ""They involve two dissimilar types of buildings that were built at different times,"" the statement said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A rifle-wielding white supremacist entered Washington's Holocaust museum on Wednesday afternoon, fatally shooting a security guard before being wounded himself by return fire from other guards, authorities said. Stephen Tyrone Johns was shot and killed while working at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on Wednesday. Stephen Tyrone Johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, later ""died heroically in the line of duty,"" said Sara Bloomfield, museum director. Law enforcement sources identified the suspect as James W. von Brunn, an 88-year-old white supremacist from Maryland. He is a known Holocaust denier who created an anti-Semitic Web site called ""The Holy Western Empire."" He has repeatedly claimed ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" a widely read book about a teenage girl's experiences under Nazi rule, was a hoax. The museum shooting occurred on a day the museum was to stage a play based on Anne Frank and two days before what would have her 80th birthday. Investigators found a notebook in the suspect's car listing other locations in Washington, a federal official told CNN. It was unclear what purpose the list served. Von Brunn allegedly entered the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum at 12:50 p.m. Wednesday and immediately shot Johns with a rifle, said Chief Cathy Lanier of the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department. Two other security guards returned fire, according to Lanier and the museum statement. Both Johns and Von Brunn were taken to George Washington University Hospital, said D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty. Johns died at the hospital. Von Brunn was in critical condition, Fenty said. Johns, 40, was a resident of Temple Hills, Maryland, according to a statement issued by Wackenhut Services Inc., which has provided security services at the museum since 2002. ""Obviously there are no words to express our grief and shock over the horrific event that took place at this museum today,"" Bloomfield, the museum director, said.  Witnesses: 'Panic' inside museum » . She said the museum was closed for the remainder of the day and would remain closed Thursday in honor of Johns. Brunn served six years in prison for trying in 1981 to kidnap Federal Reserve board members because of high interest rates. He blamed his prison term on a ""Negro jury, Jew/Negro attorneys"" and ""a Jew judge,"" he said on his Web site, ""Holy Western Empire."" The Southern Poverty Law Center, which focuses on human rights, said Brunn has ""an extremely long history with neo-Nazis and white supremacists."" A place that stimulates visitors to confront hatred and promotes peace and human dignity, the Holocaust museum on Wednesday became the scene of everything that was opposite.

Visitor Maria Hernandez told CNN she heard five shots and saw the wounded security guard.  Watch Maria describe what she saw » . ""It was definitely a security guard; he was down bleeding on the floor,"" said Hernandez, 19. ""He was face down. His back ... blood was coming out."" Sirens blared as emergency vehicles converged on the area, which is near the Washington Monument and other popular tourist attractions. The museum was full at the time, with a ""couple of thousand"" people inside, said William Parsons, chief of staff at the museum.  See where the museum is located » . ""Never take your guard force and security people for granted,"" he said. ""They did exactly what they were supposed to do to protect people in the museum.""  Law enforcement analyst talks about how this could have happened » . Dave Pearson, a sixth-grade teacher in the Washington area, said he was on the museum's fourth floor when he heard a loud noise. ""At the time, we're visiting and all of a sudden there's like a boom, and all of a sudden they told us to stop where we're at,"" he told CNN. ""Only thing we heard was a boom, and that was it.""  Watch another museum visitor tell what he saw » . An FBI official said there was no prior warning or threat against the museum. In a later statement, the FBI said members of its National Capital Response Squad and Joint Terrorism Task Force are taking part in the investigation. Lanier said the area around the museum was checked by bomb-sniffing dogs as a matter of routine. The shooting sent shock waves throughout the nation's capital and elsewhere. ""I am shocked and saddened by today's shooting at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum,"" said President Obama, who just days earlier had spoken emotionally about the Holocaust when he visited Buchenwald, a former Nazi concentration camp with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel. ""This outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""No American institution is more important to this effort than the Holocaust Museum, and no act of violence will diminish our determination to honor those who were lost by building a more peaceful and tolerant world."" Israel issued a statement through its embassy, expressing sadness and condemning the attack. Fenty called the shooting ""an extremely isolated incident"" in the nation's capital, which is a major tourist destination. ""In these days and times, you never know when someone is going to grab a gun and use it in an inappropriate way,"" he said. The museum canceled a performance scheduled for Wednesday night of a play about racism and anti-Semitism, based on a fictional meeting between Anne Frank and Emmett Till, the teenage victim of a racist killing in the United States. U.S. Attorney Gen. Eric Holder and Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, were among those planning to attend the play, which was written by Janet Langhart Cohen, the wife of former Defense Secretary and U.S. Sen. William Cohen. Langhart Cohen told CNN that Anne Frank's young life was ended by people filled with hate. She said it was hard to see that same hate manifest itself at this place of remembrance.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- A Facebook page has been shut down following claims Northern Ireland police officers were being set up for assassination on the social networking site. ""Crown Forces Watch"" had called for people to post pictures of police officers and details of security operations across Northern Ireland. The body representing officers, the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, had said publishing pictures was an attempt to ""target police officers for murder."" The Facebook page closed Thursday with the administrator saying ""this group was to report harassment only, not to endanger life as has been reported."" The page appeared after a series of recent police raids and arrests in connection with the murder in April of Catholic police officer Ronan Kerr. All the suspects were released without charge. The Facebook page claimed the men had been the victims of police harassment and intimidation and called for a response from the pro-Irish community. A description on the site read: ""Over the past few days in East Tyrone and South Derry the Crown Forces the PSNI/RUC (Police Service of Northern Ireland/Royal Ulster Constabulary) have launched a massive harassment and intimidation campaign aimed at Irish republicans.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Fish tanks, financial markets and the future of the world's climate came together at the third Principal Voices debate of 2008 in Chicago. The Principal Voices discussed climate change against the backdrop of the Shedd Aquarium, Chicago. In the tranquil and slightly surreal aquatic setting of the city's Shedd Aquarium, the panelists and audience members plunged into the problems of climate change, their solutions and ultimately why there are still reasons to be cheerful. Despite the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change, and the hammering the financial markets were receiving that very day, the panelists were able to find many reasons to be optimistic. From a growing consensus that climate change existed to the myriad opportunities we have to protect the environment, there were plenty of positives. In regards to fluctuating fortunes of the global economy, that should not make us lose sight what is at stake; ""it is just a distraction,"" said Dr Rajendra Pachauri, his face projected onto a giant screen, beamed into the room via video link from Mumbai.  See photos of the event » . It will cause a period of introspection and worry, he said to the audience and fellow panelists, but the results would ultimately be positive and a new system would emerge. The good news, said Dr Carl Hodges, was that, perversely, the situation around climate was so terrible that it was raising awareness from all quarters. Reconnecting people with how their everyday lives impact the environment was one challenge that both Alexandra Cousteau and Suzanne Malec-McKenna, the other panelists, were working towards in different ways. As Chicago's Environment Commissioner, Malec-McKenna is working at the sharp end of balancing policy with the real practicalities of managing a city and transforming its environment, and its citizens' attitudes. Adding some political noise and bite to proceedings, she championed the latest climate initiative by Chicago and continued the upbeat tone. Could the city's green policy, and world in general, afford an economic recession, asked co-host Stephanie Mehta. It's all about re-thinking, replied Malec-McKenna. ""Maybe people will hunker up rather than hunker down."" Give people the opportunity to see new ways to do business and look at the assets rather than the liability, she continued, and a new energy infrastructure would follow. Pachauri called it a ""silent revolution,"" and one that people across the world would follow. But, they need some form of leadership, he cautioned, otherwise, ""the positive forces of human energy could be misleading and we could have another cyclical problem."" Where that leadership could come from was also debated. Shell's president, Marvin E. Odum, was invited to comment on whether business could be a big driver for change. He said he believed that ultimately it is government and policy that drive the pace of reform. With a suitable aquatic backdrop, Alexandra Cousteau, granddaughter of legendary French explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, championed the emergence of shared values that crossed nations, political persuasion and culture, forming a groundswell of new environmentalism. It might not provide new leaders, but she believed just as important was the promotion of ways that people across the world could participate to negate climate change and preserve ecosystems. The challenges could seem overwhelming, said Cousteau, but Malec-McKenna added that there are a great number of global networks open to people to take action and make even the smallest changes to their lifestyle. Changing the ways in which many of us lead our lives was a tacitly agreed point, and just as important as technological advances. Innovations from operations such a Dr Hodges' Seawater Foundation have the potential to be revolutionary, although some in the audience were happy to debate the importance of his and other solutions in the discussions that took place after panel debate. What made the panelists so optimistic, asked CNN's Jim Clancy, echoing a question from CNN.com reader Sabrina Shaw Cannabrava. For Hodges, it was that his work that brings him and others joy; for Cousteau, it was the excitement of being part of the adventure to preserve and understand more about our planet; for Pachauri, it was the momentum that was building; while for Malec-McKenna, it was the possibility of a new economy. All different, but ultimately all on the same path. We'll be posting more from the debate, including audience reaction and the highlights from the discussions very soon.

"Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- Jury selection in the Casey Anthony murder trial continued Saturday afternoon following the rejection of nine potential jurors, including one man who posted to his Facebook account that he had a ""title, cover and all"" ready for a book about the case. Attorneys and Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. of the Orange County Superior Court had allowed four potential jurors through from questioning by day's end, one a 22-year-old man who said he paid no attention to the news and another a grandmother of a 2-year-old girl who described herself as ""firm and fair."" Anthony, 25, is charged with capital murder in the death of her daughter, 2-year-old Caylee, whose body was found in woods near her family's home in 2008. She has pleaded not guilty. She faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement. Jury selection is occurring at the Pinellas County courthouse. Candidates were questioned Saturday about everything from their news-watching habits to criminal records. After questioning and quickly dismissing five jurors Saturday morning for reasons ranging from financial hardship to bias, lawyers and the judge began questioning a 22-year-old man who said he doesn't follow the news ""because it's just awful."" Assistant State's Attorney Jeff Ashton questioned whether the man would be able to bear the grim details of the case. ""You've already told us you live your life avoiding unpleasant things like the news,"" Ashton said. ""Are you absolutely sure you can do it?"" ""Yes, sir,"" the candidate replied. ""No doubt in your mind?"" Ashton asked. ""No, sir,"" the man replied. When asked by lead defense attorney Jose Baez whether his decision would be influenced if Anthony declines to testify on her own behalf, the candidate said ""I can definitely understand not wanting to be up here."" The line elicited laughter from nearly everyone in the courtroom, including Anthony. Anthony's lead defense attorney sought to have the man dismissed for failing to disclose an entanglement with the law over apparent marijuana possession, but the judge refused. He was ordered to stand by for possible duty. Perry later approved the dismissal of a man who posted on his Facebook page what the potential juror said was a joking reference to a ""book coming soon"" after announcing he had been called for potential jury duty on a big trial. ""Already have the title, cover and all,"" Assistant State's Attorney Frank George said in reciting one of the posts. Also dismissed was a woman who said she had lost a son in a car accident that required an extensive police investigation. She said she viewed the charge that Anthony had lied to investigators as evidence of ""guilt by omission."" During the afternoon session, Perry dismissed a man who said he was irrevocably opposed to the death penalty. After extensive questioning by attorneys, he told a grandmother who remembered ""sweet pictures"" of Caylee but said she had no preconceived notions of the case to stand by for duty. The two other jurors who will be contenders for the final jury pool are a woman in her 60s who doesn't own a computer, and a 43-year-old man who said that while he's occasionally seen newspaper headlines that suggest Anthony is guilty, he said he is able to set that aside. ""I've also read that Donald Trump is an alien, and that Elvis is still alive and living in Graceland,"" the man said. At the end of the rare Saturday session around 5:30 p.m., the judge said the court would be in recess until 8:30 a.m. Monday. In allowing the four candidates Saturday to pass to the next phase, the judge and attorneys increased the pool of potential jurors who have not been dismissed for one reason or another to 12, although attorneys still have until the jurors are sworn in to seek their dismissal, according to the judge. Perry said he would begin swearing in jurors once the number of unrejected candidates reaches 15. Coming into Saturday's session, eight people were considered viable candidates for the jury. Twelve jurors and eight alternates will eventually be seated on the jury, which will be moved to and sequestered in Orange County, where the alleged crime happened and where the trial will take place. Jury selection was moved from Orlando to Clearwater amid intense media coverage of the case, which could make it difficult to select an impartial jury. Perry said Friday that it is imperative to seat a jury as quickly as possible before more potential jurors are swayed by the media coverage. ""The longer we wait, the more dangers there are,"" he said. The goal is to have everything finalized for opening arguments Tuesday in Orlando. Prosecutors have said they plan to show Anthony used ""a substance"" to kill her daughter. The girl's skeletal remains were found in December 2008 in woods near the Anthony home after she went missing for six months. In Session's Michael Christian contributed to this report.","NEW: Two more join 10 others who are considered viable jury pool candidates .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration could be in violation of the War Powers Resolution if it fails to get congressional authorization by Sunday for U.S. participation in the Libya military mission, House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday. In a letter to President Barack Obama that his aides made public, Boehner, R-Ohio, complained that the administration has failed to address questions about the mission that were in a House resolution passed June 3. That resolution set a two-week deadline for a response. Boehner's letter reiterated the Friday deadline and took the additional step of warning that a failure to respond could violate the War Powers Resolution. According to Boehner, a 90-day deadline for congressional authorization of the Libya mission expires Sunday. ""It would appear that, in five days, the administration will be in violation of the War Powers Resolution unless it asks for and receives authorization from Congress or withdraws all U.S. troops and resources from the mission,"" Boehner's letter said. The White House has previously said it was complying with the War Powers Resolution through frequent briefings on the Libya mission. Boehner's letter contested that assertion. ""Since the mission began, the administration has provided tactical operational briefings to the House of Representatives, but the White House has systematically avoided requesting a formal authorization for its action,"" Boehner's letter said. ""It has simultaneously sought, however, to portray that its actions are consistent with the War Powers Resolution. The combination of these actions has left many members of Congress, as well as the American people, frustrated by the lack of clarity over the administration's strategic policies, by a refusal to acknowledge and respect the role of the Congress, and by a refusal to comply with the basic tenets of the War Powers Resolution."" Such political wrangling over war powers is common in Washington, with presidents frequently seeking to expand their freedom to commit U.S. forces and Congress battling to exert influence on the process. Boehner's letter said that, in this case, ""the ongoing, deeply divisive debate originated with a lack of genuine consultation prior to commencement of operations and has been further exacerbated by the lack of visibility and leadership from you and your administration."" With his letter, Boehner raised the stakes on an issue that could prove politically embarrassing to Obama, with increasing numbers of Republicans and Democrats opposing the Libya mission. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who supports the Libya mission, said Tuesday that he expected the White House to provide Congress with details on the Libya mission this week. ""My understanding is the White House will be sending over a report and lots of information about what we've done,"" McCain said, adding that the Senate could then vote on a resolution backing the mission that would be intended to satisfy questions over the War Powers Resolution requirement. To McCain, the delay in a White House response made the issue more challenging than necessary. ""I can assure you that it's gonna be much more difficult, with a lot more amendments and a lot more debates, than if we would have done this a couple months ago,"" McCain said. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said late Tuesday that the information would probably be delivered to members of Congress on Wednesday. ""We are in the final stages of preparing extensive information for the House and Senate that will address a whole host of issues about our ongoing efforts in Libya, including those raised in the House resolution as well as our legal analysis with regard to the War Powers Resolution,"" he said. Since March 1, administration witnesses have testified at more than 10 hearings that included a ""substantial discussion of Libya"" and participated in more than 30 member or staff briefings on the matter, he said. In announcing the mission in March, Obama said U.S. forces would take the early lead in establishing a no-fly zone over the country in order to enforce a U.N. resolution calling for the protection of Libyan civilians from forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi. The U.S. forces eventually assumed a supporting role as NATO took over the mission. Congressional opponents of the mission say that its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated U.S. goal of Gadhafi's resignation or ouster and that the Libya situation could become a stalemate. The White House says incremental progress is occurring through increasing diplomatic, political and military pressure on Gadhafi to step down. In a coincidence of scheduling, Obama and Boehner are set to play golf together for the first time Saturday, a day after Boehner's deadline for information from the administration and the day before he says it could be in violation of the War Powers Resolution. CNN's Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","NEW: McCain says White House will provide information on Libya mission .

"Moneygall, Ireland (CNN) -- ""You discover a lot about yourself when you're running for president,"" Barack Obama said on the campaign trail in 2008. ""It was brought to my attention last year that my great-great-great-grandfather on my mother's side hailed from a small village in County Offaly."" Two years into his presidency and Obama has decided to pay that small village a visit. If a village can get emotional, Moneygall -- with its 300 residents -- is in raptures. Children sporting ""O'Bama"" T-shirts skip along the high street waving American flags. Beaming villagers scramble up ladders to smarten up the fronts of their homes. ""Dulux provided all the paint for all the houses in the place, they sent down a lady to coordinate all the colors and she's done a pretty good job on it you know,"" says resident Timmy O'Conor, brandishing a paint brush. ""If it passes the man himself now, that's the thing."" There's speculation the man himself may swing by the Ollie Hayes Inn for a pint of Guinness. Ollie Hayes says he's had the CIA come through some months back but there's still no certainty that it'll actually happen. If Barack Obama does stop by though, he'll find a large faux-bronze bust of himself gracing the bar and Hayes says he'll be ready and waiting with the Guinness. ""Who knows,"" says Henry Healy who I meet in the pub, ""we may all have to join him and raise a glass to his re-election campaign in 2012."" Healy is a distant relative of President Obama and was invited by the Irish-American Democrats and the American-Ireland Fund to go to Washington for his inauguration. ""Our relationship goes back to 1761 when there was a marriage between Sarah Healy and Joseph Kearney. Joseph Kearney is the great-great-grandfather of Falmouth Kearney who emigrated from this village in 1850."" Relatives though are a dime a dozen in this part of the world. Healy's aunt, 75-year-old Sadie Williams, says she thinks she's Barack Obama's oldest living relative in Ireland. ""It's very exciting for us all,"" she tells CNN. ""We all had great excitement in the beginning when the word came through he was related to us."" Williams' grandson goes to school at Kilkenny College, about an hour from Moneygall. The college boasts alumni like author Jonathan Swift and philosopher George Berkeley, the namesake of what is now the University of California - Berkeley. Now it boasts 13 students who all claim some family connection with President Obama. ""I was only aware of these two boys being my cousins,"" says the oldest of the 'Obama cousin' clan, 17-year-old Kate Condell. ""We didn't realize we were interlinked before."" There's a huge star spangled banner draped across the classroom table and the deputy headmaster has laid out a number of Barack Obama biographies. But the children admit they haven't read them. Kate Condell is the only one who's even visited the United States. ""Just Florida on a family holiday, but an invitation to the White House would be much appreciated!"" Perhaps not at Kilkenny College, but elsewhere in Ireland there is a palpable anxiety in the air. The dire state of the economy, the burden of day-to-day financial struggle, the uncertainty over whether Ireland can ever escape its debts -- these are issues which weigh heavy on a people known for their good cheer. ""We all just want a rest from it, to talk about something else,"" one pub-owner tells CNN. As many of his predecessors -- including John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and the Bushes -- have done before him, Obama is in search of his Irish roots, not least because it is sure to go down well with the 40-million Irish emigres with Irish roots living in the U.S. This is after all the start of his 2012 re-election campaign. But to the Irish on the Emerald Isle it is a home-coming; a gesture of solidarity and kinsmanship in troubled times. And a chance for the villagers of Moneygall to throw a party that will likely last long after the president's gone.","Obama visits village in Ireland where his great-great-great-grandfather hailed from .

"(CNN) -- One dead politician in a tiny Arab country and now, six years on, the quest for justice in his assassination divides a people and could add to regional instability. A United Nations-backed special tribunal issued indictments Thursday for four members of the Shiite militant Hezbollah movement in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, said a high-placed source in the Lebanese army. Hariri's family and friends expressed relief, greeting each other with ""mabrouk,"" the Arabic word for congratulations. For the first time in the recent and turbulent history of the region, an internal body was demanding accountability for a political assassination. There have been many in Lebanon's past, and so many killers have escaped unpunished. But not everyone was welcoming of the tribunal and the fallout of these indictments and ensuing trial, likely to be held in absentia, is sure to ripple through the region for months to come. In a stable and transparent nation, indictments in the assassination of a national leader would be embraced. But Lebanon has endured sectarian war for decades and analysts feared that it could see more Sunni-Shiite bloodshed in the future. Hezbollah and Syria -- which along with Iran is Hezbollah's biggest supporter -- have repeatedly denied any role in the Hariri assassination. Many Lebanese, however, believe Damascus also played a role and a U.N. source said Thursday the tribunal could also indict Syrian citizens. President Bashar al-Assad, already under global scrutiny for his regime's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, could come under intensified pressure, said Mohammad Bazzi, an adjunct fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who has been working on a project on Hezbollah in Lebanon. ""This could present a whole other level of instability and international problems for the Syrian regime,"" he said. ""This might give the United States and Europe leverage for even tighter sanctions. Beirut journalist Michael Young said the indictments come at a difficult time for Syria and Hezbollah. They make a bad situation even worse, he said. ""I think the Syrian regime is facing an existential crisis, one I believe it will lose,"" said Young, author of ""The Ghosts of Martyrs Square: An Eyewitness Account of Lebanon's Life Struggle."" ""So the indictments will only add to an already disastrous situation for the regime,"" he said. ""However, the pro-Syrian government in Beirut will have a tough domestic and international fight as it struggles to deal with the (tribunal's) indictments, and Hezbollah is facing enough worries with the situation in Syria."" Hariri, a wealthy entrepreneur turned politician, was killed in a February 2005 Beirut bombing. His supporters say Hariri stood up for Lebanese sovereignty and against Syrian influence and for that, he paid the ultimate price. His death prompted mass protests known as the Cedar Revolution that led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops, in Lebanon for almost three decades. But Lebanon remained divided over the tribunal's investigation. The pro-Western Hariri camp welcomed the probe; Hezbollah's Shiite supporters denounced it. In anticipation of the indictments, Hezbollah raged against the tribunal by saying the United States sought to discredit Hezbollah and that Israel was to blame for the assassination. Israel has denied that claim. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also made it clear that the group would not tolerate accusations against its own. ""We absolutely reject accusing any Hezbollah member of the killing of Hariri,"" Nasrallah said last year. ""We will not accept any indictment to anyone in Hezbollah."" That's a threat no one in Lebanon should take lightly, said Michael Singh, managing director of The Washington Institute and a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the National Security Council. He said Hezbollah is the only militia in Lebanon that has not disarmed and it has not hesitated to intimidate people through violence. The indictments mean that the militant group will have to implement whatever strategy it has devised to avoid accountability for a horrific crime, Singh said. ""This puts Hezbollah's partners in government in a real bind,"" Singh said. In a bind because in January, the rift over the tribunal prompted Hezbollah to collapse the government of Saad Hariri, the slain leader's son. Hezbollah and its pro-Syrian allies now form a majority in Lebanon's Parliament. The Hezbollah domination was seen as a huge comeback for Syria, which, said Singh, has never really accepted Lebanon as a sovereign state and has asserted its influence in Lebanon for years. The new prime minister, Najib Mikati, announced a new cabinet only this month and said Thursday that the ""delicate situation"" Lebanon is experiencing ""requires us to be wise"" and avert civil strife. But Lebanese authorities, outmuscled by Hezbollah's fighters, do not have the capability to arrest or deliver suspects for trial, said Young, the Beirut author. They must choose between whether to cooperate in the international justice process or stick by Hezbollah, designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department. Because Hezbollah nor Syria -- if Syrians are indicted -- will participate in the judicial process, it will be important for world powers to remain committed to the case, Singh said. ""Holding Hezbollah and Syria accountable for this is not going to be easy ... so this will take a lot of will power by the international community."" Otherwise, the ghost of a dead man could continue to haunt the Arab nation. CNN's Rima Maktabi and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","A special tribunal issued indictments in the Rafik Hariri killing .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney has claimed a heated exchange with a fan on social networking site Twitter in which he said ""I'll put u asleep within 10 seconds"" was light-hearted banter. Rooney replied to a Twitter user called sam_oldham_LFC, believed to be a Liverpool fan, on Wednesday night after receiving several abusive messages. The 25-year-old, who has over 580,000 followers on Twitter, said ""you know where I train every day kid come and do it good luck"" after his abuser had threatened to attack him. Rooney then tweeted: ""I'll put u asleep within 10 seconds u little girl. Don't say stuff and not follow up on it. I'll be waiting."" He later tried to diffuse the situation, posting: ""Ha ha bit of banter and people go nuts chill all people."" The sam_oldham_LFC account has since been deleted, while Rooney's spokesman later released a statement to the media claiming the striker's messages were no more than a joke. He was quoted by the UK Press Association as saying: ""As is made clear in the tweets, this whole exchange is banter. There is no suggestion, nor is there any intention of a suggestion, of a real fight."" On Thursday Rooney was back to tweeting about his usual topics of interest -- soccer and American Idol. A host of sports stars are on Twitter and claim it is a positive way to engage with their fans but several have fallen foul of the authorities thanks to the social networking phenomenon. Ex-Liverpool player Ryan Babel was fined $16,000 by the English Football Association after he posted a picture of referee Howard Webb in a Manchester United shirt following a controversial game between the two clubs. West Ham striker Carlton Cole was recently charged with improper conduct for remarks he made on Twitter during England's 1-1 draw with Ghana at Wembley in March. NBA star LeBron James also caused a stir when he retweeted abusive messages he received -- one of them racially charged. He followed it by posting a message himself that said: ""U see world how people feel! Just use it as extra motivation in whatever u do best! No one can stop your dreams from becoming reality!""","Wayne Rooney conducts row with abusive fan on social networking site Twitter .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Katherine Jackson's sadness over the loss of her son is constant nearly two years after Michael Jackson's sudden death from an overdose of a surgical anesthetic. ""There's not a day that passes I don't think about my child and he should be here right now,"" Jackson said in a CNN interview at her home Tuesday. ""But it was negligence of a doctor and it's just hard, really hard."" Dr. Conrad Murray, who was Michael Jackson's personal doctor, is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the singer's death. His trial has been postponed until September. Murray's lawyers suggest a frustrated and sleepless Jackson may have poured the surgical anesthetic propofol mixed with lidocaine into his juice bottle while the doctor was out of his bedroom. To help her cope with the sadness, Katherine Jackson recently moved into a spacious new mansion on a hilltop above Calabasas, California, away from the Encino home where the Jackson family lived since 1969. Katherine Jackson loves the higher ceilings and larger windows, but it's also a refuge from sad reminders that haunt the old home. ""Michael was 11 years old when we moved there and he stayed there until he was well into his 20s before he moved,"" she said. ""It just brings back a lot of memories, but they're sad memories to me now because he's not here."" Visitors to the ground floor see artwork collected by Michael Jackson, but they won't see his photographs. The three children left behind by the pop icon treasure images of their father, but his mother avoids them. What you do see are the flowers that Katherine Jackson surrounds herself with, a passion she recently turned into a business. She launched the Katherine Jackson line of floral arrangements this month, just in time for fans to send them to their moms this Mother's Day. But since she's a Jehovah's Witness, Katherine Jackson does not observe holidays. Wednesday is her 81st birthday, but there will be no celebration in her home. The youngest of Michael's children, 9-year-old Blanket, has his own way of remembering his father. His long brown hair grows longer, reaching halfway down his back. ""He doesn't want to cut it, so I've talked to him about it,"" his grandmother said. ""He likes it long because his father wanted him to have long hair at the time, but there will be a day that he'll have to cut it, I think."" Blanket studies at home with a tutor, while Prince, 14, and Paris, 13, attend classes at a private school. ""They're doing very well,"" she said. ""They're going to school everyday."" The children are shielded from news about the criminal case against the doctor accused of causing their father's death. The trial has been delayed until September, but when it does start, they won't see their grandmother around the house during weekdays. Katherine Jackson will be sitting in court. ""I plan to be there everyday,"" she said. ""If I'm able, I will be there."" She'll be there listening as the doctor who conducted the autopsy describes again, as she heard in last January's preliminary hearing, how Jackson's liver was placed in a blender so he could measure the chemicals in his organs. ""Worse comes to worse, I'll just step out,"" she said. ""I heard they're going to show some autopsy shots, and I don't want to see that. So, I'll leave and, you know, sit out in the hall or somewhere until it's over and then I'll come back in. But I just feel that I have to be there."" Katherine Jackson, although she'd rather avoid sadness, proved her strength six years ago when she sat in court for five months as her son was tried and acquitted on child molestation charges. ""Yes, I was there every day,"" she said. ""I wanted to be there for him, because I knew it was lies. I prayed for the truth to come, because I knew if the truth came out that my son would walk away and he did."" Some online media reports have suggested Katherine Jackson's health is failing, but she laughs about the speculation.  The limp you might notice in her walk is not from old age, but it a remnant of a childhood battle with polio. She stays active with her new floral venture and decorating her new home. ""I'm still here and I'm blessed and I thank God,"" she said.","""Not a day that passes I don't think about my child,"" Katherine Jackson says .

"(CNN) -- After just two hours and three minutes, John Isner stepped off the grass of Wimbledon's new No. 3 court a very relieved man on Tuesday. This time last year it took the American three days to win his record-breaking clash with Nicolas Mahut on court No. 18 in the longest match in tennis history, lasting just over 11 hours. Somehow fate conspired to have the duo drawn together again in the opening round, and the sporting world was watching to see if the agony would be repeated. That 2010 epic went to five sets, with the eight-hour decider won 70-68 by Isner. This time, however, Isner triumphed 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 7-6 (8-6) before daylight faded to earn a second-round meeting with Spanish 16th seed Nicolas Almagro. Federer, Djokovic through to round two . ""It wasn't easy but obviously it was considerably quicker than last time. I was happy how I played, especially in the third set,"" the 26-year-old told reporters. ""I was thinking if I lost that set we probably wouldn't be able to finish, and then it would have been the match going into a second day and people would have been talking about maybe a third. ""I'm glad they put us out on this court. I don't know if they wanted to tarnish the memory of what happened on Court 18. It was unlikely it would live up to that match. It's a huge relief."" After the first set went to a tie-break, it looked as if another titanic serving battle was on the cards. But Isner broke the Frenchman in the fourth and sixth games of the second set, winning it in just 26 minutes. Mahut had the chance to reduce the deficit after breaking in the third game of the third set, but Isner repaid the favor and had the edge in the tie-break to win it in 50 minutes. By comparison, last year's match featured 215 aces to 16 this time, 490 winners to 72, 91 unforced errors to 26, and 980 points played to 201. It was 47th-ranked Isner's first match since losing a five-set thriller to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the first round of the French Open last month, where Mahut fell at the same hurdle. Isner will hope he has more in reserve for his second-round match than last year at Wimbledon, where he predictably wilted in straights sets against Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker after his marathon effort.","John Isner and Nicolas Mahut clash again in repeat of longest match in tennis history .

"(Health.com) -- People who consume lots of foods rich in vitamin B12 -- such as fish and fortified cereals -- may be at lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than people who take in less of the vitamin, a small study conducted in Finland suggests. In the study, which was published in Neurology, researchers in Scandinavia analyzed blood samples from 271 individuals ages 65 to 79 who showed no evidence of dementia. The researchers tested for levels of a blood marker of vitamin B12 and for levels of homocysteine, an amino acid that has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (as well as heart disease and stroke). B vitamins, including B12 and folate, have been shown to help lower homocysteine levels, so high levels of the amino acid suggest low levels of B12. Health.com: 9 foods that may help save your memory . Over the next seven years, 17 study participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The people with the highest levels of homocysteine at the beginning of the study had the greatest risk of developing the disease. In contrast, each unit increase in the marker of vitamin B12 (known as holotranscobalamin) reduced the risk of developing Alzheimer's by 2 percent. The relationship between vitamin B12 and Alzheimer's risk is ""complex,"" says Dr. Sudha Seshadri, M.D., an associate professor of neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine and the author of an editorial accompanying the study. But, she adds, ""B12 levels, particularly holotranscobalamin levels, likely play a contributory role."" The links among Alzheimer's risk, homocysteine, and B12 were more pronounced in older individuals, the study found. Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . Blood levels of folate, which the researchers also measured, were not related to homocysteine levels or Alzheimer's risk in this study. Folic acid -- a synthetic version of folate found in many supplements and multivitamins -- has been shown to lower homocysteine in previous studies, but its effect on disease risk is disputed. A National Institutes of Health panel recently concluded that there are no foods or vitamins that definitively prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease, and experts say this study is consistent with the panel's recommendations. ""A healthy diet likely remains important,"" Seshadri says. ""The role of supplementation remains unclear."" Health.com: Ginkgo doesn't work: are there better ways to save your brain? Maria Carillo, Ph.D., the senior director of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, urges caution in interpreting the new findings, especially given that so few study participants developed the disease. ""We do know that vitamin B12 is a huge contributor to lowering homocysteine levels,"" she says. ""Lowering these in general is important for cardiovascular health, and this study strengthens our knowledge about its role in risk for Alzheimer's disease."" Dr. Sam Gandy, M.D., the associate director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City, says that it may make sense for people to get blood tests to measure their levels of B12 and folate. Health.com: How to age-proof your memory . However, he says, the study findings may not necessarily translate to people outside Scandinavia. And he worries that the results may spur doctors to recommend B12 injections to their patients -- a preventive treatment that he says is unfounded and already overused. It's still unclear whether increasing your intake of vitamin B12 will help protect you from Alzheimer's, Gandy says.

"Pointe Aux Chenes, Louisiana (CNN) -- The marshes here have long been a refuge for the Native Americans living in Louisiana's bayou. ""We came to live here because it was marshland, where nobody else wanted to live,"" said Chuckie Verdin, the chairman of the Pointe Aux Chenes Indian Tribe. The tribe is made up of about 700 members whose ancestors were forced from their lands and resettled to Louisiana more than 100 years ago. That refuge, already strained from coastal erosion, is facing a new menace: the oil spill spreading uncontrollably across the Gulf of Mexico. On Saturday, the same day that the state closed fishing in the area, Verdin addressed some of the tribal members in the town's cinder block church. Before the tribal meeting, the members recite a prayer in a French dialect, a language picked up by their ancestors from European settlers generations ago. Several men have come directly from hauling in the last catch of shrimp and blue crab. They sit in the pews still wearing their calf-length rubber fishing boots. Verdin, a veteran fisherman and oil rig worker, doesn't downplay the threat growing just a few miles away. ""This could be the end of our way of life,"" Verdin tells the crowd from the altar. He is wearing a black T-shirt that reads ""I am a Point Aux Chenes Tribal Member and I Count."" Grim expressions cover the faces in the small crowd in the church. People ask if there has been any response from a letter sent to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal asking for help.  Verdin shakes his head. Since the tribe is still fighting for federal recognition, it is not empowered to appeal to Washington. That recognition, tribe members said, would give them special protections and expanded powers to push for the help they say they need. They are uncertain of how to negotiate with BP, which has set up an office on the second floor of the church to hire people to place protective booms off the coast. People complain they feel cut off and alone. The tribal members say no federal or state officials have come to advise them on what to do. However, a small delegation of Native Americans has made the long journey from Alaska to share their experience dealing with the aftermath of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. ""There were severe human impacts with the workers who tried to clean up the oil spill in Alaska,"" said Faith Gemmill, who spent 14 hours flying to get to Louisiana. ""These are persistent impacts, they don't go away."" But if this area is going to be protected from the encroaching oil spill, the residents of Pointe Aux Chenes will have to do it themselves. Taking a boom supplied by BP, Verdin and about 25 other tribal members set off in their fishing boats to seal off their wetlands from the oil, which is already reaching the shoreline. Before they leave, a BP worker inspects the boats and orders the men -- most who have been fishing for all their lives -- to wear life jackets. Verdin says if BP provided him with more boom and agreed to hire more workers, he could probably get 100 people on the job. What concerns the tribe the most is a small island off the coast of Pointe Aux Chenes they call their sacred grounds. It is the land where many of their ancestors are buried. Hurricanes carried away the headstones years ago.  It is bare ground except for a large, simple white cross. From the back of their boats -- some with names like ""Geronimo"" and ""Crazy Horse"" -- the workers place the boom on the water's edge. Several large globs of a reddish-brown oily substance are floating inside the boom. The clumps have been spotted in other areas where the tribal members fish.  But this is the closest they've seen it to Porte Aux Chenes. It is not the first time the tribe has made a stand to protect the burial ground. In the 1970s, Verdin said, tribal members stood on the shores of the sacred ground cradling shotguns and rifles to face down oil company workers intent on dredging the land for a pipeline. The oil company dredged elsewhere, but the results were still catastrophic. Tribe members say the deep cuts made through the marshes brought in saltwater and led to coastal erosion. That erosion has turned the once abundant oak trees in Pointe Aux Chenes -- which means ""Oak Point"" in French -- into empty husks. Erosion has also turned areas where people once lived into waterlogged marshes or open water. In 2005, Hurricane Rita brought up to 8 feet of water to parts of the town, Verdin said. Adding oil to such a storm surge would prove disastrous. ""If we get oil up in here and you get a hurricane, I don't see them letting us come back,"" Verdin said. ""Who's going to clean that after, how long is that going to take?"" But for tribe member Lulu Dardar, the disaster already has struck. A single mother of four, she ekes out a living from catching shrimp and blue crab off her small boat. Dardar's face is a deep brown from a life working in the sun. On the last day of fishing before the state closes the water because of the spill, Dardar unloads baskets of blue crab in the pouring rain. Once the crab is on the dock, she is out work but with mouths still to feed. ""I don't know what I do next, this is all I know how to do,"" Dardar said. ""I don't know what I do tomorrow.""","Gulf oil spill threatens sacred burial ground of Louisiana's Point Aux Chenes Indian Tribe .

"(CNN) -- More than 17,000 women and girls from Nepal become sex slaves every year. Many end up in India, China or other Southeast Asian countries, and roughly half of them are children. Anuradha Koirala -- the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year -- has been fighting to end this sex trafficking for nearly two decades. Since 1993, she and her organization, Maiti Nepal, have helped rescue and rehabilitate more than 12,000 women and girls. Recently, Koirala partnered with actress Demi Moore on ""Nepal's Stolen Children: A CNN Freedom Project Documentary."" For the film, which premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. ET, Moore traveled to Nepal to meet Koirala and some of the people rescued by her group. CNN's Kathleen Toner recently spoke with Koirala, 62, about how her life has changed since being honored as Hero of the Year and what work remains to be done. Kathleen Toner: How did you feel when you were named Hero of the Year in November? Anuradha Koirala: There were so many other people doing very good things who were being honored, so I wasn't expecting it. I was shocked. I first thought of all of my girls at Maiti Nepal. I wished I was in front of them. I wished I was in my country. But I knew it was a chance to draw attention to the problem of sex trafficking. When I returned home, they had a big rally with thousands of youths. I realized that the whole country was eager to work hard to make Nepal trafficking-free. It was wonderful. Toner: How have things changed for you? Koirala: I now feel that there is extra responsibility on me. I feel I must be even more committed since people around the globe are depending on me. I need to work even harder to get to the end. We are working so hard. Our work is the same as before ... but (we want) to monitor more of the border crossings. The border with Tibet is a very important area. ... It's very difficult. People easily take a one-day pass to go across to Nepal, and no one monitors. We've found many girls being taken across the border and being used in different entertainment sectors and brothels, so now (we're considering) working there. At this point, the most important thing we have to do is surveillance and stop, stop, stop girls from being exploited. Toner: What was it like to work with Demi Moore on ""Nepal's Stolen Children""? Koirala: She was superb. I have seen artists, film stars, musicians and all kinds of celebrities, but often they look very snobbish, very superior. She was very down-to-Earth. She knew the issue and was really committed. When we were working on the documentary, we had to go to the home of a girl who'd been trafficked, but it was very difficult. Her village was in the mountains, and her home was on a very steep hill. It was a very hard walk for half an hour. (Moore) is very determined (to help). When she came to Maiti and met the girls, she was so good with the children. She really is committed to this issue. If more people like her come into this field, then maybe we will succeed someday. Toner: What do people need to know about this issue? Koirala: This problem of trafficking children and women needs to be addressed, because HIV and trafficking are synonymous with each other. The fundamental human rights of the girl child are being seriously violated. It is a heinous crime, and it harms the girls physically and psychologically. It's also increasing the transmission of HIV to a larger population. We have to make more awareness, and everyone should be involved: NGOs, government ministries, police, media, community activists and the entire community. (We) can't reach every affected individual; families and communities need to be assisted and encouraged to take responsibility. ... At the end, the whole theme is sensitizing and increasing awareness of the public on a large scale. Toner: It's such a widespread problem. Do you think that you are making progress? Koirala: Yes. If not, I would not have been chosen (as CNN Hero of the Year). But more sensitizing and awareness is needed. Nothing is impossible if the whole world collaborates. If CNN supports us, if the U.S. government supports us, if all of the world supports us, why can't we (end sex trafficking)? But I think I have to live also for another 20 years.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- At least seven Somali civilians were killed Friday morning when people trying to take food clashed with government troops at the Badbaado refugee camp in Mogadishu, a witness told CNN. Mahamed Ali, a refugee at the camp, said several other people were wounded in the incident, which was sparked when food supplies were taken. David Orr, a spokesman for the World Food Programme in east, central and southern Africa, said the organization was working to clarify what happened. ""This incident highlights the challenges that humanitarian agencies face in trying to deliver assistance in this difficult environment,"" he told CNN. The incident came a day after the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was ratcheting up emergency operations to help an additional 1.1 million people suffering from famine under drought and conflict. The agency is asking donors for $87 million more to address the crisis. ""The move comes in response to a situation that is becoming ever more desperate,"" said Jakob Kellenberger, the president of the agency. ""Hundreds of thousands of Somalis face life-threatening food and water shortages."" The African Union, however, postponed its donor conference by two weeks, without giving any reasons. The meeting planned for August 9 now will take place August 25. The United Nations estimates that 29,000 children have perished in the past month. Valerie Amos, the under-secretary for general and emergency relief, told CNN Thursday that 600,000 may die. She urged support for the aid organizations that are able to operate in southern Somalia, in areas controlled by rebel Al-Shabaab militants, who have banned international agencies. Al-Shabaab launched a Ramadan offensive Monday amid the spreading famine, with heavy fighting reported in northeastern Mogadishu, according to African Union officials. The United Nations declared famine in three more regions of Somalia on Wednesday -- the war-ravaged capital, Mogadishu, as well as the Ifgooye corridor and the Shabelle regions west of Mogadishu. The human catastrophe was triggered by the worst drought in more than a half-century and compounded by decades of conflict, high inflation and increasing global food and fuel prices. The United Nations issued a famine declaration for two districts of southern Somalia in June. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance. Somalia is the worst hit.","Several others were wounded, the witness says .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Afghan Taliban forcefully denied reports Monday that their leader is dead, dismissing them as ""claims and rumors"" from the ""Kabul stooge regime's intelligence directorate."" Mullah Mohammed Omar ""is alive and well and is leading the Mujahideen in all aspects while living safely with reliance on Allah,"" spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. His statement came after suggestions that Omar might have been killed recently. A spokesman for Afghanistan's intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, said Monday that Omar has disappeared in the past five days. Lutfullah Mashal said he ""hopes"" Omar is dead but cannot confirm it. ""So far, we cannot confirm the death or killing of Mullah Omar officially. But we can confirm that he has been disappeared from his hideout in Quetta, Baluchistan"" in Pakistan, he said. ""Our sources and senior Taliban members confirm that they can't contact him,"" Mashal said, adding that Omar had been living in Quetta for 10 years. Taliban spokesman Mujahid said they ""strongly reject these false claims of the enemy"" and urged ""our fellow countrymen, Mujahideen and the rest of the Muslims not to believe these intelligence lies and false reports."" Pakistan's Interior Rehman Malik also denied that Omar was dead, saying in a news conference that the claims were ""baseless."" An official with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force told CNN there was no indication the rumor was true. A former top Pakistani intelligence official called the reports ""nonsense"" and ""disinformation,"" but then said he had no idea whether the Taliban leader is alive or dead. ""How should I know? I'm not concerned with it,"" Gen. Hamid Gul said on IBN television. The original news report suggesting Monday that Omar was dead, by Afghanistan's TOLOnews, quoted NDS spokesman Meshal as saying that Gul was moving him when he was killed. ""Am I supposed to be transporting him from Quetta to Waziristan? It's nonsense,"" he said by telephone from Islamabad. Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency is thought to have had strong links with the Afghan Taliban over the years. Omar was a rural Islamic cleric when became a leader of a group of students -- or ""taliban"" -- who took over Afghanistan in the early 1990s and established a hard-line Islamic fundamentalist regime that gave shelter to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network. U.S. Navy SEALs killed bin Laden on May 2 in Pakistan, nearly a decade after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The United States led an invasion of Afghanistan soon after the attacks, toppling Omar's Taliban and sending bin Laden into hiding. The reclusive Omar refused to be photographed or filmed and rarely traveled. He infrequently gave interviews and was thought to have met only two non-Muslims in recent years. Nonetheless what Omar said passed as law when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, and to challenge him was unknown. The ""commander of the faithful,"" as he had become known, created the Taliban in the early 1990s and was their spiritual guide. Those who had met him said he cast an imposing figure -- bearded with a black turban and one eye stitched shut; the result of a wound sustained during a gunfight with Soviet troops during their occupation of Afghanistan. In the wake of the Soviet withdrawal, Omar created the Taliban to overcome what he saw as Afghanistan's descent into a lawlessness landscape dominated by warlords. His recruits came from the Islamic schools within Afghanistan and in the Afghan refugee camps across the border in Pakistan. Driven largely by faith, they swept across the country. Before the final assault on Kabul in 1996, Omar entered Kandahar's grand mosque and took out a rarely seen holy cloth thought once to have been carried by the Prophet Mohammed. Waving it from a rooftop he received an ecstatic response from his Taliban foot soldiers. Inspired by religious fervor, they moved on to take Kabul within a matter of days, bolstering Omar's belief in his spiritual destiny. With most of the country under Taliban control, he set himself the goal of transforming Afghanistan into the purest Islamic state in the world, declaring himself Amir-ul-Momineen, or head of the Muslims. While many ordinary Afghans disagreed with his hardline interpretation of Islam, others were willing to endure the Taliban's excesses in exchange for the relative peace they brought to the territory they controlled. In building the perfect Islamic state, though, he had little regard for the concerns of the outside world. Public executions and amputations were common and the Taliban's treatment of women attracted much international condemnation. In 2001, he rejected pressure from around the world -- including from many Muslim countries -- not to go ahead with plans to demolish two ancient statues of the Buddha carved into cliffs near the town of Bamiyan. The statues, described by many as world-class cultural relics, were blown to bits. Mullah Omar dismissed the global outcry, saying the statues' destruction was merely ""breaking stones."" Omar vanished after a U.S.-led coalition booted the Taliban and its leaders from power in Afghanistan in December 2001 for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 terror attacks. His appearance remained a mystery to many, and that presented a challenge to those on his trail, according to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. ""If I come across him tomorrow in the streets of Kabul or Kandahar or Herat or Mazar in Afghanistan, I would not recognize him,"" Karzai told CNN in 2003. ""How would you arrest someone that you don't know how he looks?"" The Taliban, citing ultra-orthodox views of Islam, outlawed photographs of people, saying making any image of a human being was forbidden by the Quran. But intelligence agencies argued that another key purpose of that move was this: If the leaders of the Taliban could keep anyone from taking their pictures, it would be very hard to track them down or prove they were the men in charge during the Taliban's most brutal and repressive days. The U.S. government offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to his capture. Many in the U.S. intelligence community believed he was holed up in or near Quetta, a city of 1 million people that is the capital of Balochistan province in southwestern Pakistan. Pakistan has consistently dismissed those claims. Occasionally, the elusive leader would release a written message to reiterate that the Taliban had not given up its fight to regain control of Afghanistan from American and NATO troops. The battle ""is forging ahead like a powerful flood"" and ""is approaching the edge of victory,"" said one such online message in 2009.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The Sudanese president was scheduled to arrive in China on Monday, but the visit has been delayed without official explanation, Chinese ministry officials said. Omar al-Bashir is the subject of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the region of Darfur, where war has continued since 2003. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it had no information about why al-Bashir's arrival has been delayed. The Sudanese Embassy in Beijing said it did not know how the delay would affect his schedule. Al-Bashir left Tehran, Iran on Sunday to attend a conference on combating terrorism, the state-run news agency in Sudan reported. His plane left Iran to go to China but returned to Iran because of concerns over attempts to enforce the international court's warrant, senior government officials in Sudan said. There were fears that countries that recognize the International Criminal Court would take action if al-Bashir's plane crossed their airspace on its way from Iran to China, the officials said. China voted against the statute that created the International Criminal Court and is not among more than 100 countries that recognize it. Prior to his trip, the Sudanese leader gave an interview with China's state-run news agency, Xinhua, in which he touted the longstanding ties between the two nations. ""We regard China as the strategic partner for Sudan in various fields, including the political, economic, commercial and cultural,"" al-Bashir said in the interview, published Sunday by Xinhua. ""China does not interfere in the internal affairs of others. The success of the Sino-Sudanese cooperation has pushed the African countries to search for the real and loyal partner."" Last week, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch called China's invitation to al-Bashir ""an affront to victims of heinous crimes committed in Darfur."" ""Al-Bashir's flouting of international arrest warrants should be cause for condemnation, not for an invitation,"" said Richard Dicker, the group's international justice director. ""Beijing should instead be using its influence to press for justice in Darfur."" The Sudanese president has deflected opposition to him, telling Xinhua in a story posted Saturday that Western nations went after him and his forces in order to ""cover up the acts committed in Iraq and Afghanistan."" Al-Bashir, who became Sudan's president in 1993, is scheduled to be in China through Thursday at the invitation of its president Hu Jintao, according to Xinhua. This will be his fourth visit to the Asian nation, after trips there in 1990, 1995 and 2006, when he attended a Sino-Africa Cooperation Forum summit in Beijing.

"(CNN) -- Uncertainty over Inter Milan's coaching position ended on Friday as chairman Massimo Moratti announced that former Genoa boss Gian Piero Gasperini will be replacing Leonardo. The 53-year-old, who guided Genoa into Serie A in 2007 before being sacked last November following a bad run of form, will sign a two-year deal at the San Siro. He will be officially unveiled ""as soon as the final bureaucratic formalities are completed"" according to the Italian club's website. Leonardo, who replaced Rafael Benitez in December 2010, is expected to take up a sporting director role with France's Paris St Germain -- a former club of his which has been recently bought by a Qatari group. Could Villas-Boas succeed at Chelsea? Club president Massimo Moratti expressed his ""full satisfaction with the choice"" and the 67-year-old wished his new employee ""the success that brought Inter the title of world champions."" While Benitez took Inter to the FIFA Club World Cup title, he was unable to successful follow on the exploits of Jose Mourinho -- who took Inter to an unprecedented treble in 2009-10, winning the European Champions League plus a domestic double. Under Leonardo, Inter finished runners-up to city rivals AC Milan in Serie A last season and claimed a seventh Coppa Italia crown. A World Cup winner with Brazil in 1994, the 41-year-old had been a surprise choice after both playing for and coaching Milan. Moratti and Inter have reportedly suffered setbacks in their search for a new boss, with former Chile national team coach Marcelo Bielsa rumored to have been approached regarding the position. Andre-Villas Boas was another coach linked with the post, but the 33-year-old has now been appointed manager of English Premier League club Chelsea. England coach Fabio Capello, who has twice been in charge of Milan, was also linked with a move to Inter.","Gian Piero Gasperini will become the new coach of Italian club Inter Milan .

"(CNN) -- The Las Conchas fire in New Mexico swelled to 92,735 acres burned Thursday, and strong winds threatened to be firefighters' greatest challenge moving in to the fifth day battling the flames. ""We have seen fire behavior we have never seen before,"" Fire Chief Doug Tucker told reporters Thursday. Tucker said no fire was coming from the south and that Thursday the fire would keep moving north towards Santa Clara. Officials also dispelled rumors that residents, who were worried about their homes, could return to Los Alamos. ""Folks right now are hurting us,"" said Police Chief Wayne Torpy Thursday.  ""Los Alamos County called the evacuation and Los Alamos County will be the one that repeals the evacuation ... You're going to erase the success of our evacuations."" Torpy also said that residents' homes had not been impacted by the fire. However, the nearby flames will keep the Los Alamos National Laboratory closed through at least Friday, a statement on the lab's website said. ""What I witnessed today was an incredibly professional job by men and women who are risking their lives to save our community and this laboratory,"" Charles McMillan, the lab director, said Wednesday.  ""I could feel the heat of the fire on my face as I watched from the roof of our Emergency Operations Center."" The Los Alamos fire, which is officially called the Las Conchas fire, has forced nearly 10,000 people from their homes in the town. Jerome MacDonald, operations section chief for the multi-state southwest area Incident management team, said fire officials flanked the fire on the east side Thursday in an attempt to curb high winds from the southwest. Concerns were raised that the wildfire could put the Los Alamos lab at risk, as well as waste or other toxic materials stored at the site. But Tucker said that the waste is stored in drums that are kept on a blacktop with no vegetation around and are safe from fire. If the fire should get too close to the drums, firefighters were ready to use foam to ensure that nothing would be released into the environment, he said. The Las Conchas Fire began on private land Sunday and expanded into the Santa Fe National Forest and Jemez Ranger District, according to InciWeb, an online database that keeps track of natural disasters such as fires and floods. The fire was 3% contained Thursday. In a news statement released Wednesday, the Santa Fe National Forest and Valles Caldera National Preserve said that parts of both preserves would close to the public until the fire is more controlled. Parts of the national forest have been placed under ""stage III"" fire restrictions, meaning all areas are off-limits for use unless otherwise posted. The Las Conchas Fire touches the south border of the lab's 40-square-mile facility, and comes close to the west border, according to Tucker. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez warned citizens to avoid using fireworks on the July Fourth holiday and the rest of the season. The Las Conchas Fire is one of several burning in the region. The Donaldson and Game Fires south of the town of Hondo and U.S. Highway 70 have merged into one fire that has consumed an estimated 43,290 acres and is 0% contained, according to the New Mexico Fire Information website. Evacuations were ordered for Alamo Canyon Wednesday as the Donaldson fire continues to threaten parts of Lincoln County. The Pacheco Fire continues to burn in the Pecos Wilderness, two miles north of the Santa Fe Ski Basin. It has scorched 10,000 acres since it began June 18. The blaze was 24% contained Thursday, with the potential for growth considered low, according to InciWeb.

"Orlando (CNN) -- What had been planned as an extended weekend work day in the Casey Anthony murder trial abruptly ended Saturday morning as the judge overseeing the case ordered a recess over the sudden emergence of what one analyst said must be a major issue. ""Obviously it's big, and obviously it's troublesome and obviously it's something that can't be disclosed,"" HLN legal analyst Linda Kenney Baden said. Judge Belvin Perry emerged from his chambers Saturday morning after nearly an hour of discussions with attorneys both in and out of the courtroom to announce the day's planned testimony would be canceled. He said only that the delay was due to a legal issue unrelated to complaints prosecutors raised first thing Saturday morning about expected testimony from Kenneth Furton, a chemistry expert the defense had planned to call Saturday. A defense attorney said he was hoping for a ""quick resolution. ""We are expecting the trial to continue on Monday,"" attorney Cheney Mason said. Anthony's lawyers are trying to discredit the prosecution theory that the Orlando woman rendered her 2-year-old daughter Caylee unconscious with chloroform, duct-taped her mouth and nose and stored the body in her trunk for a few days before dumping it in the woods. Anthony, 25, is charged with seven counts, including first-degree murder. The defense says Caylee accidentally drowned in the family pool and that Anthony and her father panicked and covered it up. In what has become a familiar strain during the trial, prosecutor Jeff Ashton complained to Perry that defense attorneys didn't disclose Furton's plans to testify about things that weren't contained in his initial report provided to prosecutors or mentioned in his formal interview with them. Perry has previously admonished Baez for failing to disclose planned testimony to prosecutors, going so far as to say he will consider contempt proceedings against him once the trial is over. Furton was to testify about explanations for vile odors and the presence of chloroform in the trunk of Casey Anthony's car, where prosecutors claim she stored the body of her daughter before dumping the remains in a wooded field. Chloroform can be given off by a decomposing body. One prosecution expert described the levels of the substance in the trunk of Anthony's white Pontiac Sunfire as ""shockingly high."" Several witnesses also testified for the state about odors that they said smelled like the unmistakable scent of human decomposition. Furton did not provide specific alternative explanations for the presence of odors or chloroform in his initial report or in his interview with prosecutors, Ashton complained. ""Once again we are in the position of experts having supplemented their opinions without notifying the state,"" Ashton said. Defense attorney Jose Baez disagreed, saying nothing in Furton's planned testimony differed from his previous opinions. ""Mr. Ashton can continue to make these allegations and make these allegations and then suddenly they become true in his world,"" Baez said. ""But I do not believe they are true."" Perry indicated that he would not allow Furton to testify on Saturday, but didn't rule on the controversy before ordering the trial to recess until 8:30 a.m. Monday morning. But he did hint at his frustration. ""You would think this would have grown old by now but I guess some things never change,"" he said. Saturday marked the end of the fifth week of testimony in the trial, which began with opening statements on May 24. Perry lengthened Saturday's work day from the usual half-day in an effort to speed the trial's conclusion. He originally told jurors, who are being housed in an Orlando hotel shielded from media coverage of the trial, that the trial could last six to eight weeks. On Friday -- before Saturday's delay -- Baez said he expected the defense to rest on Wednesday or possibly Thursday. That would leave room for a rebuttal case from the prosecution and closing statements before the Independence Day holiday. It is unclear how Saturday's delay will affect those plans. Anthony could face the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charge, first-degree murder. The charges against her also include misleading authorities and aggravated child abuse. Caylee was not reported missing to police until July 15, 2008, when Anthony's mother, Cindy Anthony, tracked down her daughter and demanded answers regarding Caylee's whereabouts. Prosecution witnesses described Anthony's behavior in the month after Caylee was last seen as nonchalant, testifying how she spent time with her boyfriend, went shopping and to nightclubs. Baez said in his opening statement that Anthony behaved as she did because years of sexual abuse by her father had conditioned her to conceal the truth and hide her pain. George Anthony has denied the claims that he abused his daughter or helped conceal his granddaughter's death. In Session's Michael Christian and Jean Casarez contributed to this report.

"San Angelo, Texas (CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs asked to leave the courtroom Friday and will not be representing himself during the penalty phase of his sexual assault trial. But before being escorted out of the Texas courtroom, Jeffs delivered a message to jurors demanding that the proceedings cease. Deric Walpole, one of the defense attorneys Jeffs had fired earlier in trial, represented him Friday as the penalty phase of the trial continued. Jurors will decide his punishment after hearing additional witness testimony in the penalty phase of the trial. Prosecutors say . this phase of the trial could last several days. The leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on his conviction of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who were his ""spiritual wives."" The jury convicted him of two counts of sexual assault on a child -- charges filed after a 2008 raid on a ranch his church operates near Eldorado, Texas. Jeffs represented himself during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial. He was silent during most of his 30-minute closing argument Thursday, mumbling at one point, ""I am at peace."" Texas prosecutors rested their case Wednesday after playing a key piece of evidence for jurors: a 20-minute audio tape that began and ended with a man saying prayer. Prosecutors alleged that the recording was of Jeffs' sexual assault of a then-12-year-old girl in the presence of three other ""wives."" The girl had grown up in Jeffs' Yearning for Zion ranch, authorities said. Prosecutors showed the jury a photo of her with her arms around Jeffs, and a marriage certificate that listed the girl's age as 12 at the time. Jurors also heard audio recordings that prosecutors said showed Jeffs instructing a 14-year-old and his other young ""wives"" on how to sexually please him in order to win God's favor. Prosecutors said the 14-year-old was Jeffs' ""spiritual wife"" and conceived a child with Jeffs when she was 15. Jeffs could be sentenced to five years to life in prison on the charge of aggravated sexual assault regarding the alleged 12-year-old. For the other count, he could face a sentence of two to 20 years. Jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Their practice of polygamy, which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago, is part of the sect's doctrine.

"(CNN) -- English club Chelsea have completed the signing of Oriol Romeu from Spanish and European champions Barcelona. The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth $7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at $14 million after the first year and $21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is ""renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability."" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese outfit have paid $5 million for the 23-year-old which, like the Romeu deal, includes a buy back option. Jeffren joined Barca from Tenerife in 2004 and made his debut for the Catalan club in the 2006-07 season. He told the club's official web site: ""I know that the slogan of my new club is strength, dedication, commitment and glory and from today onwards I will do all in my power to make these things come true."" Barcelona also confirmed that Argentinean defender Gabriel Milito can leave the club on a free transfer. Meanwhile, Juventus have confirmed they have rejected a bid from Russian club Zenit St Petersburg for defender Leonardo Bonucci. The 24-year-old joined from Bari at the beginning of last season and a statement on the club's web site said they wanted to keep hold of the player.","Chelsea complete the signing of Barcelona youngster Oriol Romeu .

"(CNN) -- Authorities along the central coast of California are searching for a missing boy they believe was snatched from the shelter where he was staying by another resident. Police issued an Amber Alert Friday for 4-year-old Jeremy Guthrie, who is thought to be wearing a camouflage shirt and bright blue underpants. ""Very dynamic situation as you can imagine. We're mobilizing every possible, every imaginable resource to find Jeremy. Unfortunately, we have not been successful at this point,"" said Steve Gesell, interim police chief. Jeremy and his mother had been staying at the First Baptist Church Shelter in Atascadero, California, police said in a statement. He was last seen around 9 p.m. Thursday and may have been abducted around 4:30 a.m. Friday, when a door alarm sounded, they said. The mother of the boy told police he could have been taken by Annette Hale, 52, who was also staying at the shelter. The two women had a disagreement Thursday night, said Gesell. ""A witness was reported to have heard a little boy say 'I don't want to go,' or something similar to that, and we have an eyewitness that believes they saw a woman holding what may have been Jeremy in a blanket as they left the building,"" he said. Hale is around 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs 200 pounds. She has brown hair, glasses and is not related to the missing boy. Gesell said she has a history of erratic behavior, but is not thought to be violent. Jeremy was described by police as 3 feet, 5 inches tall with brown hair. He may have a blanket with him, they said.","NEW: The suspect and the mother of the missing child reportedly had a disagreement .

"(CNN) -- Self-help guru James Ray has been convicted of negligent homicide in the deaths of three participants in an Arizona sweat lodge ceremony, but he was found not guilty of manslaughter charges. The case will continue June 28, when the jury will convene to make a decision regarding aggravating circumstances in the case. Prosecutors claimed that Ray's recklessness in operating the sweat lodge caused the deaths of Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee; and Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota. Sweat lodge ends a free spirit's quest . They died after participating in a the ceremony organized and led by Ray in 2009. At least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill. More than 40 others were uninjured. Prosecutors argued that the lodge, made of willow trees and branches and covered with tarpaulins and blankets, was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. They also said Ray didn't monitor the temperature inside the lodge or the well-being of participants and was indifferent to those clearly having trouble. Ray's lawyers countered that what happened was a tragic accident, not a crime. They asked witnesses who were in the sweat lodge whether they signed a release form warning them of the dangers. All replied that they signed, but some said they didn't read the form. Ray's attorneys also suggested that exposure to an unknown toxin in the lodge -- perhaps a pesticide, rat poison or something in the type of wood used to heat the rocks -- could have caused the deaths. Event participants paid up to $10,000 to seek ""new areas of consciousness"" at the October 2009 Spiritual Warrior retreat in the desert, according to trial testimony. Many had attended previous James Ray International seminars.","Self-help guru found guilty of negligent homicide in deaths of three people .

"London (CNN) -- The computer hacking collective LulzSec denied that a teenager arrested this week was a key player in the group, and claimed Wednesday it brought down the Brazilian government's website. ""TANGO DOWN,"" the group announced on Twitter, using military slang that has been appropriated by hackers to say they have interrupted service to a website. The websites of the Brazilian government and presidency were failing to load Wednesday morning, hours after LulzSec said it attacked them. It also downplayed the role in LulzSec of Ryan Clearly, whom British media have named as the 19-year-old hacker who was arrested in Essex, outside of London, on Monday. ""Ryan Cleary is not part of LulzSec; we house one of our many legitimate chatrooms on his IRC server, but that's it,"" the group tweeted. ""Clearly the UK police are so desperate to catch us that they've gone and arrested someone who is, at best, mildly associated with us. Lame."" The suspect remains in custody but has not yet been charged, London's Metropolitan Police told CNN Wednesday. They did not confirm his identity. Naming suspects who have been arrested is illegal in Britain. On Tuesday they announced the arrest of a 19-year-old suspected of hacking into systems and mounting denial of service attacks against ""a number of international businesses and intelligence agencies."" A police spokesman, who declined to be named in line with custom, said the arrested man's computers will be examined for activities related to hacks against the UK's Serious Organized Crime Agency, the CIA and Sony. Sony's PlayStation Network went down on April 20 after what Sony said was a massive data breach. It had more than 70 million subscribers at the time. It began coming back online in mid-May. The PlayStation Store did not reopen until June 2. The company estimated the cost of that attack will total $171 million. Hackers later broke into Sony Pictures' website, compromising the accounts of over 1 million users, and the gaming company Sega, stealing nearly 1.3 million users' details via a British subsidiary of the Japanese company. Sega makes games for PlayStation and other gaming systems. The suspect's computer will also be examined for links to LulzSec, another police spokesman told CNN, who also declined to be named in line with custom. ""This link has not been established yet as it is still early days,"" the spokesman said. LulzSec posted an irreverent denial that its leader was the one arrested. ""Seems the glorious leader of LulzSec got arrested, it's all over now ... wait ... we're all still here! Which poor bastard did they take down?"" they said on Twitter several hours after the announcement of the arrest. LulzSec claimed recently to have attacked the CIA website, and took credit for hacking into the website of the American public broadcaster PBS and posting a fake story saying the rapper Tupac Shakur was still alive. He was killed nearly 15 years ago. It's unclear whether LulzSec members played a role in the Sony PlayStation Network breach. But they have posted on their website what they claim is proprietary information from Sony Pictures and other Sony properties' websites. On Friday, on the occasion of their 1,000th tweet, the group posted a manifesto of sorts in which they said people, including their targets and advocates of Internet freedom, should be thankful. ""The main anti-LulzSec argument suggests that ... our actions are causing clowns with pens to write new rules for you,"" the group wrote. ""But what if we just hadn't released anything? What if we were silent? That would mean we would be secretly inside FBI affiliates right now, inside PBS, inside Sony ... watching ... abusing ... ."" They seemed to suggest that by making their attacks public, they'll push websites to increase security. They said they're sitting on account information for 200,000 players of the online game Brink, but moments later said that releasing people's information is worth doing sometimes because it's fun. ""Yes, yes, there's always the argument that releasing everything in full is just as evil, what with accounts being stolen and abused, but welcome to 2011,"" they wrote. ""This is the lulz lizard era, where we do things just because we find it entertaining."" Analysts said the group appears to be some sort of spin-off of ""Anonymous,"" the loose coalition of hackers that grew to prominence through their support of the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks. But while Anonymous has its own set of moral codes and is largely politically motivated, LulzSec seems to be random. For every hack like the one on PBS, which the group said came out of anger over a documentary about WikiLeaks, there's the cracking of porn site pron.com -- and a subsequent public list of members' e-mail addresses and passwords. CNN's Per Nyberg, Carol Jordan and Doug Gross contributed to this report.","LulzSec says it attacked the Brazilian government website, which is down .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The sinking of a duck boat that killed two people was ""another tragic example of the deadliness of distraction"" the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday after a final report showed several people involved were on the cell phones or computers. The National Transportation Safety Board released its final report Tuesday for the duck boat crash last July in Philadelphia. The collision killed two Hungarian tourists, Dora Schwendtner, 16, and Szabolcs Prem, 20, and plunged the amphibious vessel and its 35 passengers plus two crew members underwater. The five-member safety board met to discuss the findings, probable cause and safety recommendations from the final report presented to the board by NTSB investigators. The fatal collision between the duck boat and a barge on the Delaware River was ""another tragic example of the deadliness of distraction,"" said Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the NTSB. 2010: Tour boat calls before crash went unanswered . According to NTSB findings, tugboat pilot, Matt Devlin, made and received 21 cell phone calls in addition to surfing the Web using a company laptop during his more than two hours at the wheel. After the accident, Devlin initially told his superiors and the Coast Guard that he was dealing with a serious family medical emergency involving his 6-year-old son. Devlin refused to talk to investigators after those initial interviews. The tug pilot was on an outbound personal cell phone call that lasted five to six minutes; investigators said at the time the duck boat operator was calling for help. The deckhand on the disabled duck boat also was texting, and he sent several messages after dropping anchor, including one a minute before the barge hit. The accident is not about the actions of one person, instead it is shedding light on a new and highly troubling societal norm, Hersman said. ""This is going to reach epidemic proportions,"" she said. ""It is well past time to pay attention."" Devlin was in the tug's lower wheelhouse, not the upper wheelhouse as originally thought, leaving the stalled, 33-foot duck boat in his blind spot, investigators said. The sightseeing duck boat was anchored in the shipping channel after being shut down because the boat's operator saw smoke and feared an on-board fire. One of the final communications before the crash was from the operator of a passenger ferry moments before the two vessels collided: ""Hey northbound barge. Northbound barge at Penn's Landing. That duck boat is broken down."" Ride the Ducks initially suspended its Philadelphia operation following the crash. Operations resumed in April with new safety procedures. In addition to the two passengers who drowned, 10 other passengers suffered minor injuries, according to an NTSB report released several months after the incident.","The final NTSB report shows several people involved were on cell phones or computers .

"(CNN) -- Voices around the Middle East and North Africa gave mixed grades to Barack Obama's address on the region Thursday, with Libyan rebels calling it ""good enough"" and a Palestinian official calling it a ""half-full glass."" In Benghazi, the heart of the Libyan revolt against longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi, a rebel leader pronounced Obama's speech in support of democratic movements across the region ""good enough."" ""Overall, the speech was positive for Libya,"" said Jalal el-Gallal, a spokesman for the National Transitional Council. Rebel leaders were pleased to hear Obama call their provisional government ""legitimate and credible,"" remarks that raised hopes of eventual U.S. recognition as the country's rightful government -- and accompanying aid. ""Hopefully, they will recognize our aspirations,"" el-Gallal said. ""They will recognize us fully, and we can bring this chapter to an end."" In his Washington speech, Obama pledged U.S. support for reform efforts across the Middle East and North Africa, warning leaders facing popular upheavals that ""strategies of oppression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore."" It comes amid the Arab Spring, popular revolts that have driven two regional autocrats from power and fueled calls for reform or open revolts in several other countries. He also pledged additional economic aid for longtime U.S. ally Egypt and said the United States and European Union would push for expanded trade with the region. That was good news for Riad Greiss, who watched Obama's address from a Cairo coffeehouse. Greiss said tourism -- one of the pillars of Egypt's economy --  has dried up since the pro-democracy protests that drove Hosni Mubarak from power after three decades. ""We are feeling it's getting worse, not better,"" Greiss told CNN. Greiss, an engineer from Egypt's Coptic Christian minority, said Egypt's revolution ""needs time. It needs a steady push, but time."" On the eve of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the American leader restated the U.S. desire for a comprehensive settlement of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His call for an agreement based on Israel's pre-1967 borders drew criticism from Netanyahu, who called those frontiers ""indefensible,"" but Obama also poured cold water on Palestinian efforts to seek a unilateral declaration of statehood at the United Nations. Nabil Shaath, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, called the speech a ""half-full glass."" He told CNN that Abbas would review the speech with all Palestinian factions and present Obama with some ""specific requirements"" for translating his rhetoric into ""a real peace process."" On Syria, Obama praised the courage of Syrian protesters who have defied a violent crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad and blasted al-Assad's government for choosing ""the path of murder"" in response to calls for democratic change. Al-Assad, he said, ""now has a choice: He can lead that transition or get out of the way."" But on the social media site Twitter, a supporter of the Syrian revolt sounded a note of disappointment. ""We Syrians started this alone and if ur too afraid to take action, we can handle this alone,"" the poster said. Obama's passing reference to Yemen, in which he urged embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh to ""follow through"" on his reported agreement to step down after 32 years in power, drew mixed reviews from anti-government protesters there. ""We wanted Obama to directly call Saleh to leave office the same way he did with Mubarak,"" said Saleh Kayyat, a youth leader in the capital Sanaa. ""He did not do that. This is wrong, and he is not being honest with the wave of change in the Middle East."" Another protester, Ala'a Jarban, told CNN, ""We had hoped to hear more."" But Obama ""spoke directly to the Yemeni people,"" Jarban said. ""That's something we're not used to hearing, and it's an improvement. But we realize that President Obama cannot give as much to the Yemeni people as we can give to ourselves."" And Michele Dunne, a former White House and State Department expert on the Middle East, said Obama's address was ""a lot more timid than it needed to be."" ""He spoke a lot more about self-determination and reform than he did about broader concepts like democracy and freedom,"" Dunne told CNN. ""He has been pretty cautious about approaching these changes in the Middle East,"" added Dunne, now an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""At least now he has said openly ... that the United States will stand up for its principles in its actions toward the Middle East."" CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Sara Sidner, Rima Maktabi, Mohammed Jamjoom and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","Reaction pours in to Obama's Arab Spring speech .

"(CNN)  -- A man suspected of killing five members of his family and wounding another on Thursday committed suicide after police surrounded him in a house, police in Cleveland, Ohio, said Friday. Police say Davon Crawford, 33, killed his new wife, her sister and three children. Acting on a tip, police surrounded the house and then entered it after seeing a man who matched the description of suspect Davon Crawford briefly step outside, police spokesman Lt. Thomas Stacho said. ""They confronted the male hiding in a bathroom,"" Stacho said. ""When he spotted the agents, then he took his own life."" Cleveland police launched a manhunt Thursday for Crawford, 33, suspected of killing his new wife, Lechea Crawford, 30; her sister, Rose Stevens, 25; and three of Stevens' children, Destiny Woods, 5, and 2-year-old twins Dion and Davion Primm. A 7-year-old boy was shot and hospitalized, Julie Short, a spokeswoman for MetroHealth Medical Center, said Friday. The boy's grandfather told CNN affiliate WEWS that the boy was in stable condition and talking after having been shot in the shoulder. A fourth child, a 12-year-old boy, managed to escape, WKYC reported. The Cleveland Plain Dealer also reported that a 2-month-old girl, the daughter of Davon and Lechea Crawford, escaped the shooting unharmed and is being cared for. Police began searching for Crawford, 33, Thursday night after receiving a call around 8 p.m. to the upper floor of a duplex.

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Arlene appeared to be losing steam as it lumbered across Mexico Thursday, but authorities said the possibility of torrential rains and flooding still threatened many parts of the country. Arlene, the first named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, was moving west-southwest at about 7 mph, packing sustained winds of 40 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. It was expected to diminish into a tropical depression later Thursday. Forecasters from the center warned of possible flash floods and mudslides. In Tamaulipas, rains began early Thursday, and precautions were being taken in the southern part of the state, which is expected to be among the hardest hit, said Adan Moctezuma, spokesman for the state government. An alert had been issued in the region, telling residents to prepare for evacuations if necessary. Mexican authorities issued a hurricane warning as Arlene advanced, but that warning had been lifted by Thursday afternoon. A tropical storm warning remained in effect from Tampico, Mexico, south to Barra de Nautla, Mexico. The storm is expected to produce 4 to 8 inches of rain in some areas, while isolated amounts of up to 15 inches could fall in mountainous terrain and could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides. The Atlantic hurricane season spans June 1 to November 30.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic's blistering start to the year has secured him a place at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals even before the second Grand Slam event of the year. The Serbian has won 37 straight matches in 2011, claiming the Australia Open and six other tournament titles. His most recent came at the Rome Masters on Sunday when he defeated world number one Rafael Nadal. He has now beaten Nadal in four finals this year, and was the man to end the Spaniard's two-year winning run on clay in Madrid just over a week ago. And it was his victory in the final at Rome that handed the 23-year-old the 1,000 ranking points he required to ensure he will be at the finale of the season in London in November between the best eight players in the world.

"(CNN)  -- Wladimir Klitschko will take a hefty weight advantage into his world heavyweight title unification match against David Haye in Hamburg Saturday. The Ukrainian tipped the scales at 17st 4lb, while Britain's Haye came in at 15st 2lbs, over two stones lighter. Haye, a former cruiserweight champion, will be putting his WBA title on the line while Klitschko defends the IBF and WBO versions of the world crown. The 30-year-old Haye will be two pounds heavier than for his last fight against fellow Briton Audley Harrison, while Klitschko is five pounds lighter than for his previous bout against Samuel Peter. Haye was supported by a large British contingent who have gathered in the Geman port city for the fight in the Imtech Arena used by Bundesliga side SV Hamburg. Despite a 25-1 record, Haye is rated an underdog against the giant Klitschko, whose brother Vitali holds the WBC version of the title. But he was in typically bullish mood as he addressed reporters after the weigh-in. ""I'm so proud to be involved in it and  for the guy that knocks the other unconscious it is going to be a great feeling, to be the main man, at the pinnacle of the heavyweight division. ""I believe being the unified heavyweight champion is the pinnacle of the sport and I'm looking forward to going in there and claiming my rightly-deserved titles,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A Northwestern University professor who allowed a couple to demonstrate a sex toy in front of students apologized Saturday, saying he regrets upsetting people and should not have allowed it. While psychology Professor J. Michael Bailey called the incident a ""mistake,"" he also said the February 21 incident provoked important debate about issues including academic freedom and the effect of sexual attitudes on education. ""I am sorry that these issues that are important have been raised in this way, instead of directly through words and arguments in the classroom,"" Bailey told CNN on Saturday. ""That said, now that they have been raised, let's talk."" It was the first time Bailey has expressed regret for the incident, which drew national headlines. University President Morton Schapiro had said he was ""troubled and disappointed"" by it and had ordered an investigation. The event took place in an optional after-class session for Bailey's human sexuality course at the prestigious private university near Chicago. Bailey previously explained he wanted students to learn about sexual diversity and information from ""real people."" Students who witnessed the incident had been told repeatedly by a guest speaker that what was about to happen would be graphic, the professor said. About 100 students chose to attend following a larger lecture, affiliate WGN said. Bailey invited speaker Ken Melvoin-Berg, co-owner of Weird Chicago Tours, who brought a woman and a man for a discussion on the female orgasm. Melvoin-Berg suggested they demonstrate use of high-powered equipment they brought, said the professor, who agreed to the idea. Melvoin-Berg told CNN affiliate WLS that they received ""100% positive feedback during and after"" the demonstration, but some students left while it was happening. ""For me, I'm glad I didn't see it. It was a little too explicit for me, and if I were in the class, if I would have stayed for the demonstration, I probably would have left. I know a couple of my friends did get up and leave,"" student Diana Lorenzini told CNN affiliate WLS. Brianne Williams, another student, said ""Doctor Michael Bailey is one of our finest professors here, and his class is about opening people's minds up."" Bailey said he was surprised the incident generated so much controversy. ""During a time of financial crisis, war and global warming, this story has been a top news story for more than two days,"" he said in a statement posted on the WLS website. ""That this is so reveals a stark difference of opinion between people like me, who see absolutely no moral harm in what happened, and those who believe it was profoundly wrong."" Bailey told CNN he is receiving a ""tremendous amount of support"" from colleagues, students, parents of students, alumni and academics from all over the world. As a researcher of human sexuality and sexual orientation, Bailey said he has encountered controversy over his work before and has even been attacked because of his research. The university, he said, has always been supportive and tolerant. ""I have felt at least some regret since before this story ever broke, and the more I thought about it, the worse I felt for some of my colleagues at Northwestern who are upset about it, including the president,"" he said. ""It makes his job harder and the benefit to students certainly did not justify the degree to which it has hurt Northwestern at least these past few days."" Bailey said he is working with undergraduate students to arrange an event that includes ""high-level discussion and debate"" about the incident, and that he hopes to have Schapiro's input for the event.

"(CNN) -- One smiles for the camera, another appears defiant, while a third looks serene. They all look straight into the camera. Their confessions are blunt and candid -- it's a relatively new strategy used by Mexican authorities. Under pressure to show results from a nationwide offensive against organized crime, the Mexican government has been releasing videos of high-profile interrogations. Most of the subjects are suspected drug lords who have been recently captured and are in jail awaiting trial. The new approach comes nearly five years into President Felipe Calderon's term. By some estimates, more than 40,000 people have died since he took office in December 2006 and launched the drug offensive. As his strategy has become unpopular with many in Mexico, his administration has been pressured to respond to the criticism and show the results of his efforts: more than 20 of the country's 37 most-wanted criminals killed or captured since March 2009. Jose de Jesus Mendez Vargas, also known as ""The Monkey,"" is a reputed co-founder and co-leader of the Mexican drug cartel known as ""La Familia."" In his video interrogation, he explains what kind of men his cartel recruited as operatives. ""(We would choose) young men who didn't do drugs, who had a good profile, and who were good to the full extent of the word, that did things right, and who didn't kidnap people,"" Mendez says. La Familia announced its creation in 2006 in the Mexican state of Michoacan by tossing five severed human heads onto a dance floor. Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez, also known as ""El Diego,"" was the reputed leader of ""La Linea,"" a gang of enforcers for the Juarez Cartel in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. In his video interrogation, he admits that he was the mastermind of an attack against federal police officers using a car bomb. ""We kidnapped an individual who belonged to the Sinaloa Cartel; we killed him, and dressed him with a local police uniform. He was thrown at an intersection right next to a vehicle with explosives and somebody activated the explosives remotely with a cell phone,"" Acosta said. He also says he gave the order to kill U.S. consular employee Leslie Enriquez and her husband, Arthur Redelfs, as well as 15 young people at a house party in Mexico's murder capital, Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. ""Since they were all minors, there was a lot of commotion, and, yes, honestly, some of them were innocent,"" Acosta says. Jesus Enrique Rejon Aguilar, aka ""El Mamito,"" was a former Special Forces officer who allegedly deserted to join the cartel known as ""Los Zetas."" He admits he owned as many as five so-called ""narco tanks"" or ""monsters,"" custom-made armored trucks with swiveling turrets and reinforced steel battering rams. In a revealing moment, he tells his interrogator the thing that he regrets the most. ""Is there anybody you would want to ask for forgiveness? I mean, for your actions, for what you did, if you failed somebody, your children, your family?"" his interrogator asks. Rejon responds: ""Oh, my mother. Because of this I haven't seen her in about 17 years. ... It's hard... it's cruel, but that's the way it is."" Despite the offensive, however, violence has continued unabated as the remaining drug cartel leaders fight turf and succession wars, especially in such border states as Chihuahua and Tamaulipas that have traditionally been transit points for drug shipments headed for the United States.","Mexican authorities have begun releasing interrogation videos .

"(CNN) -- Bahrain's Prince Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa has decided to decline an invitation to the royal wedding in London, citing the unrest in his country. Al-Khalifa wrote to Britain's Prince William to let him know that with ""deep regret"" he was declining his invitation. The decision was ""left for as long as possible in the sincere hope that ongoing events -- resulting from recent unrest in the Kingdom of Bahrain -- might have improved, leaving me able to join the celebrations of the House of Windsor and the family of Miss Middleton, without being overshadowed by issues in Bahrain,"" Al-Khalifa wrote. Prince William is set to marry Kate Middleton on Friday. Protests swept the strategically important island kingdom earlier this year as populations across the Arab world rose up against their rulers. Bahrain, where the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet anchors, is a small, predominantly Shiite country governed by a Sunni royal family. The Bahraini government has been criticized for its response, and some human rights groups have reported that authorities have raided hospitals and tortured doctors and patients in an effort to quell protests. The government denies the claims. The Bahraini prince has defended the government's actions response to the protests. ""We were immensely concerned that some of our youth were pushed towards a destructive path and that the nation was drawn along with them,"" Al-Khalifa said, according to an official transcript of a recent speech. ""We took necessary action to preserve lives and the livelihood and interests of all the people, based on our commitment to Islamic and Arab values,"" he said. On Sunday, the crown prince said in a statement that he was ""saddened and troubled"" by British media reports concerning his attendance at the royal wedding. Those reports ""fundamentally misrepresented"" his views and outlook on the current crisis, he said. Al-Khalifa ended his note to the British royals by wishing ""Prince William and Miss Middleton all good wishes for Friday and every possible happiness for the future ahead.""","Prince Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa was invited to Prince William's wedding .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A safety panel convenes in Japan Tuesday to examine whether two vaccines widely used around the world contributed to the deaths of five children in the past month. Japan's health ministry ordered doctors to stop immunizing infants with the vaccines while authorities investigate Pfizer's Prevenar vaccine and Sanofi Pasteur's ActHIB vaccine -- commonly given to infants in the United States and other developed nations. The health ministry said it suspended the vaccines because the children all died within a short period of time; four died last week and one died in February. Three of the infants had underlying medical conditions, the health ministry said. Authorities are investigating the medical history of one of the children, and the fifth child had no apparent illness at the time of vaccination, according to the ministry. Both companies maintain that their vaccines -- which are aimed at stopping bacteria that can cause meningitis, pneumonia and other serious infections -- are safe. ""Pfizer thoroughly reviews and continually monitors all of its medicines and vaccines, as safety is our top priority,"" Pfizer said in a statement. ""No causal relationship has been established between the events reported in Japan and vaccination to date. We are conducting a thorough evaluation of these cases in cooperation with the relevant regulatory health authorities."" Sanofi Pasteur said that the company expresses condolences to the families who had lost children, but also said that no causal relationship between the deaths and the ActHIB vaccine had been established. ""We have been and will be providing all data of ActHIB and will fully collaborate with the ministry of health and welfare,"" the company said. Prevenar prevents illnesses caused by pneumococcal bacteria and ActHIB prevents infection with the Haemophilius influenza. Pediatrician Michiko Suwa said Japan's medical community hopes the suspension is temporary and fears the government is overreacting to the deaths. ""I'm concerned that this will impact the future of these critical vaccines,"" she said, noting that she has been receiving concerned calls from parents since the government announced the suspension. The World Health Organization has backed the inclusion of Prevenar in national childhood immunization programs, especially in developing nations where infant mortality remains high. Pfizer estimates it has distributed more than 360 million doses of the vaccine, which is available in more than 100 countries around the world and part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in more than 50 countries. In Japan, 2 million doses have been administered. The U.S. Food and Drug administration said it was aware of the suspensions in Japan, but ""physicians assessing vaccine safety at the FDA and CDC have not detected new safety concerns"" related to the vaccines.","Pfizer's Prevenar and Sanofi Pasteur's ActHIB are suspended in Japan .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Hezbollah's leader plans to speak Saturday about the indictment of four party members in the assassination six years ago of Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's former prime minister. The group's press office said Hassan Nasrallah plans to make remarks about the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which issued indictments and arrest warrants this week in the February 14, 2005 killing of Rafik Hariri and 22 others. Hezbollah is a Shiite political faction in Lebanon that provides social services to its constituents, but it has long been regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and as an ally of Iran. It has had longstanding animosity toward the tribunal, based on the expectation that some of its members would be indicted as conspirators in Hariri's assassination, and Nasrallah has accused the group's arch-enemy Israel of the assassination. The tribunal submitted to Lebanese authorities a sealed indictment and arrest warrants for an unknown number of suspects. A highly-placed source in the Lebanese Army told CNN the four include Mustafa Badreddine, Hasan Oneisa, Salim Ayyah and Asad Sabra -- all Hezbollah members. Badreddine -- who is the brother-in-law of Imad Mughniyeh, a former Hezbollah commander who was assassinated in Syria in 2008 -- is reported to be a member of Hezbollah's advisory council. A U.N. source familiar with the tribunal said the people indicted include alleged perpetrators on the ground. Two additional lists of indictments are expected later this summer and are expected to include the organizers and planners of the attack, the U.N. source said. An indictment had been submitted in January and was then amended three times. Daniel Fransen, a pre-trial judge with the tribunal, ""ruled that the indictment shall remain confidential to help Lebanese authorities in fulfilling their obligations to arrest the accused,"" the tribunal said. It won't comment on the identity anyone named in the indictment. Authorities in Lebanon will have to report to the tribunal within 30 days on the measures they have taken to try to arrest the accused. Many Lebanese believe the killing revolved around the controversies over Syria's role in Lebanon, occupied at the time by Syrian troops, and the Damascus government's strong political influence in Lebanon. People believe Hariri wanted the Syrians to withdraw from Lebanon and lessen Syria's influence, and many suspect that Syria and its ally Hezbollah went after Hariri because of his stance on this issue. Those suspected connections of Hezbollah and the Syrian government to the killing have raised tensions in the country, stoking fears of sectarian conflict erupting in the ethnically and religiously diverse nation, which endured a civil war from 1975 to 1990. Syria had thousands of troops in Lebanon and great influence in the country until mass protests after Hariri's assassination known as the Cedar Revolution forced their withdrawal. Syria has denied any involvement in the assassination. Another was result of the anger toward the attack was the creation of the tribunal. The United Nations and the Lebanese Republic negotiated an agreement on the establishment of the body, based in the Netherlands. CNN's Nada Husseini contributed to this report .","Hassan Nasrallah has blamed the killing on Israel .

"(CNN) -- The Mexican Football Federation has banned eight players from taking part at next month's Copa America tournament in Argentina after they were caught bringing women back to the team hotel. The octet were suspended for sixth months and fined more than $4,000 each following the incident after a friendly match in Quito, Ecuador, on Saturday. Jonathan dos Santos, a reserve-team player for European champions Barcelona, was banned along with Mexico-based Israel Jimenez, Nestor Vidrio, Marco Fabian, Jorge Hernandez, Javier Cortes, Nestor Calderon and David Cabrera. ""The players already confessed and are full of remorse. They have apologized to the team, the supporters, the technical commission, and to the federation and have said they'll take responsibility for their actions,"" Mexican federation director Hector Gonzalez Inarritu told reporters at a press conference in Mexico City. River Plate's fate a warning to Latin American giants . The July 1-24 tournament features 10 South American teams plus guest nations Mexico and Costa Rica. Mexico, which won the CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament in the U.S. this month, will take a 23-man squad made up mainly of players aged under 22. The eight replacements all came from Mexican clubs. It is the third soccer scandal to hit the Central American nation in the past year. Five other international players were banned after testing positive for the banned drug clenbuterol at the end of May, which the federation's secretary general Decio de Maria blamed on bad meat they had eaten. Last September, Carlos Vela and Efrain Juarez were given six-month bans and 11 teammates were fined for holding a party at a team hotel after a friendly against Colombia in Monterrey that month. Mexico moved up to ninth place in the world rankings after beating the United States in Saturday's Gold Cup final, returning to the top-10 for the first time since July 2007. Meanwhile, in Wednesday's matches at the Women's World Cup in Germany, Brazil beat Australia 1-0 as Rosana scored the only goal in the second half for the 2007 runners-up. The defender pounced to fire home a loose ball nine minutes after halftime to give the Samba Queens a winning start to their Group D campaign in Monchengladbach. Brazil will next play 1995 champions Norway, who earlier beat tournament debutants Equatorial Guinea 1-0 in Augsburg. Emilie Haavi scored the only goal in the 84th minute after the Africans' goalkeeper Miriam failed to deal with a low cross by Leni Laursen Kaurin, with the 19-year-old netting for the fifth time in just nine internationals.

"(CNN) -- With Kinect, the new controller-free system for its Xbox 360 gaming console, Microsoft isn't just trying to revolutionize video gaming. The company wants to change how people interact with all their entertainment choices. Kinect, which goes on sale Thursday, allows players' physical movements to control action on the screen. Unlike the similar Nintendo Wii or Sony Move, there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push. Three camera sensors and four microphones help Kinect recognize who is standing in front of it. The system recognizes voice commands and reads a player's full range of movements -- not just swings of the arm -- translating them into an avatar's actions within a game. Alex Kipman, director of incubation for Kinect, said Microsoft is trying to break down technological barriers and make game interaction more natural. ""We wanted to transform entertainment where technology understands you,"" Kipman said during a Kinect demo in Washington. ""It was our goal to merge really amazing tech with a really amazing experience."" Kipman explained that the specific components used to create Kinect have been around for years. He said the real breakthrough was in the proprietary software used to make it all work together. Cloud profiles, featuring information accessed from the Web on an as-needed basis instead of from a local hard drive, help the Kinect and Xbox 360 learn about users and what types of entertainment they might be interested in. Kinect also will help live-stream music, movies and more in real time. The much-anticipated system, first unveiled more than a year ago, is Microsoft's entry in the growing era of motion-controlled gaming pioneered by the Wii in 2006. Sony launched Move, a motion-sensing game controller for its PlayStation 3 console, in September. A Microsoft spokesperson said 30,000 North American retailers would have Kinect available Thursday, with 7,000 of those planning to open at midnight. She would not say how many units would be available on launch day. The system will launch with at least 17 games. I spent four days testing out Kinect, which should appeal to casual gamers and families more than hardcore action gamers. Here are my impressions: . Getting started . Out of the box, the Kinect sensor is 11 inches long and 3 inches high, including the motorized stand it sits on. Connecting to the Xbox is easy. For the new Xbox 360 Slim consoles, it is plug-and-play -- no additional wires. To use on the original Xbox 360 consoles, you will need a power source for the device. After some software downloads, the Kinect calibrates itself to the room automatically. It is actuated by specific gestures (waving your hand at the Kinect) or by using a specific key word for voice commands (""Xbox""). ""It is technology that understands you,"" Kipman said. ""Kinect looks at 48 points on the body to figure out what it should do. It always knows who is in charge."" The Kinect should go at or as near eye level as possible so it can read all your movements. Also, it requires a clear space to play so nothing impedes its view of the player and nothing gets bumped or knocked over. Someone playing alone will need to be at least 6 feet back, while two players should be about eight feet from the screen. Kinect comes bundled with ""Kinect Adventures,"" an introductory game that teaches you how to use the device. Hovering your hand over game menu options activates those choices. Five different adventures require the player to move and react to different scenarios. ""Rallyball"" will get you reacting to things being thrown at you. ""River Rush"" and ""Reflex Ridge"" get you dodging and steering. ""Space Pop"" requires using your arms to propel you in a weightless situation. ""20,000 Leaks"" will stretch you out as you try to stop water from rushing in through cracked glass. All of these adventures teach players how to use their movements to control the action on the screen. The gestures will come in handy for other Kinect games. Fun with wild animals . ""Kinectimals"" was demonstrated at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in June, where it received high marks for its cuteness factor -- and lower marks for being, well, a little bizarre. In the game, players get to adopt a virtual pet. Among the 40 choices are a Bengal tiger, lion, panther, cheetah or leopard cub. By using voice commands and body gestures, kids can teach their cub to do tricks, feed and brush their baby animal, or just play games with it. It is definitely a game geared toward younger players. I play a lot of first-person shooter games, but I'll admit there is something neat to rubbing a tiger cub on its belly -- even if it is virtual. Full-body sports . ""Kinect Sports"" cranks up the action with six different games at four different skill levels. From the outdoors to the table top, different sports challenge players to really get involved with the action. Full body movements mimic those that would be needed to really play the sport. Want to score a goal in soccer? Kick the ball. Want to knock out your opponent in boxing? Throw a punch. ""The only skill you need is life skill,"" Kipman said. ""If you know how to bowl, you can bowl in our game."" The action and movements are lifelike and will get players moving. For example, while you won't actually have a javelin in your hand, you will need to run in place up to the line and throw. The escalating skill levels make it easy for players to learn what to do and master those actions before moving up to more challenging opponents. Wheel-free racing . ""Kinect Joy Ride"" offers different game modes that let you race cars, do stunts or even crash into objects -- and each other. But it doesn't feel quite right because, with Kinect, there is nothing to feel. You control your car by grabbing an imaginary steering wheel. There is no accelerator or brake; the game does that for you automatically. Turning your hands left or right steers the car, but there is no tactile feedback to give you the sensation of running off the road or colliding with a light pole. This isn't a ""Grand Turismo"" title by any stretch of the imagination. But a racing game should have a feel to it -- this one just leaves you grasping for air. Get your body moving . Two other initial titles, ""Your Shape: Fitness Evolved"" and ""Dance Central"" are where Kinect really shines. ""Your Shape: Fitness Evolved"" features workouts created by Men's Health and Women's Health magazines. Players are scored on how well they match the movements of instructors who demonstrate exercises. There are Zen exercises for relaxation, or cardio boxing if you want to blow off steam in a different way. There are also personalized exercise plans to help lose weight, tone the body or get more energy. The game offers a good workout. Kinect helps correct postures and actions so users can get the most benefits out of the exercises being done. In this way, it really does work well. ""Dance Central,"" made by the creators of ""Rock Band,"" aims to get you moving to the beat, but realizes we all aren't ready to strut our stuff on the dance floor. The game combines today's dance hits performed by pop stars with moves that seem clunky at first but get more involved and intense as the difficulty ratchets up. Like ""Guitar Hero,"" you have to match your movements to those on the screen to get a perfect score. Beyond games . Because it has cameras, Kinect also offers the ability to connect via video with other Kinect users -- or those who use Microsoft's Live Messenger program on their PCs. It also works with the other entertainment features for the Xbox 360, such as on-demand ESPN, music from Zune.com and movies from Netflix. ""It is all about your choice, your content when you want it,"" Kipman said. The bottom line . I didn't get to test out the 11 other games that Microsoft says will use the new controller. But my experience with the initial six titles shows where Kinect will shine and where it will stumble. Games that feature full-body movement make best use of what Kinect can offer. Syncing up your movements with the movements on the screen is a lot easier and more natural with Kinect than with a normal controller. It's also hard to compare the Kinect to Sony's Move -- the two systems are like apples and oranges. I was pleasantly surprised and amused by Kinect's ability to record video while you are playing. While I was doing hurdles in ""Kinect Sports'"" track and field, my kitten decided to join the fun and began jumping as I jumped. Needless to say, the resulting video of us provided many laughs after the game. But games that would be better enhanced with a physical device in hand feel flat. On Kinect, they're just not up to the demands that players make from those types of games. You will probably not enjoy racing games and first-person shooter games as much with Kinect that you do with regular controllers. Right now, the Kinect can understand languages from the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan and Canada -- with more to roll out in the near future. Kipman said they will be constantly refining voice-recognition software to help the system recognize dialects in each language. Prices range from $399 for a 250GB Xbox 360 Kinect bundle to $299 for the 4GB bundle and $149 for the Kinect box by itself, without the console. Is it worth it? That may depend on whether you have kids -- and what kind of gamer you are.","Kinect introduces a gaming system where there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The first photos of Tiger Woods cradling his new baby boy have been released amid speculation the injured world number one could announce a return to competitive golf ""any day now."" Tiger Woods poses with his family including new son Charlie and dogs Yogi and Taz. Charlie Axel Woods was born on Sunday, February 8, and is the second child for Woods and his wife Elin. He is pictured here with his 20-month-old sister Sam their dogs Yogi and Taz, who is seen planting a well-timed lick on Tiger's face. Woods had been waiting for the birth of his second child before making public any decision about a return to the Tour in 2009. His long-time caddie Steve Williams told Television New Zealand an announcement could come ""any day now,"" and that Woods could return to competitive golf ""in the next few weeks."" ""He's probably 95 percent of the way there. He was waiting for the birth of his second child which came about last week so he's ready to go, just needs a little bit more walking,"" Williams told TVNZ. ""He hasn't been able to walk too well. But anytime in the next few weeks he's going to tee it up."" Williams said Woods ""definitely"" wants to play a couple of tournaments before the U.S. Masters at Augusta in early April. The world number one has been out of the game since winning his 14th major title at the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines last June. He underwent reconstructive surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and a week later ruled himself out for the rest of the 2008 season. Williams told TVNZ that Tiger had been practicing six hours a day, and that the only concession he has made to his injury was to adjust his swing. ""He's had to modify his swing a little bit to accommodate his knee but the guy always finds a way,"" Williams said. He added: ""Nine months out of the game after a major operation is a long time. But he's a hell of a competitor and one of the best we've ever seen in this game so I would suspect that he'll carry right on, but time will tell that."" Last month, Woods issued a statement saying that he was practicing and making progress towards at a return to the PGA tour. He said after January 1, he started hitting longer irons and his driver, although was not swinging as hard as he could, adding ""I'm working towards that goal."" Earlier this month he predicted the new addition to the family would make it a ""hectic Spring"" and said that he'd be taking it ""tournament-to-tournament.""","Golfing legend Tiger Woods poses with his family, including new son Charlie .

"(CNN) -- Most of those killed on the helicopter that crashed in eastern Afghanistan overnight were a part of the fighting force known as the Navy SEALs, two U.S. government officials said. The men who died were not the ones who killed Osama bin Laden in May, but they belonged to the same unit, a military official said. The group has its origins in World War II, when the United States realized that to invade Japan, it needed savvy, quick-thinking fighters who could perform reconnaissance at sea. Beyond tactical expertise, the SEALs -- short for Sea, Air and Land teams -- needed to have extraordinary physical strength. According to the SEAL web site, they became known as jack-of-all-trade troops, able to survey China's Yangtze River disguised as Chinese nationals in 1945 or conduct demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast during the Korean War. It was the SEALs who were sent to kill bin Laden in Pakistan, ending a decade-long manhunt. The SEALs did not get their name until after President Kennedy spoke about his admiration for special forces troops and his hope that the U.S. military would better enhance its capacity for unconventional warfare, counter guerrilla and clandestine operations. There was a new and pressing need for more advanced military techniques during the time. Among other missions, the SEALs were deployed to act as advisers and train South Vietnamese commandos. Vietnam was the first American war to be broadcast widely on television and media, and woven into popular culture for mainstream consumption. It solidified the image of the SEALs as the ultimate tough guy, a reputation burnished by reports of SEALs' ability to do face-to-face combat with Vietcong and stories of their work with the CIA. The relationship between America's spy agency and its elite troops was crucial to gaining real-time intelligence for missions sometimes carried out at the last minute -- perhaps an asset more important now than ever, experts have said. The war against al Qaeda is just as much about obtaining reliable intelligence as it is winning on the battlefield. SEALs victories have been many. During Vietnam, they performed a covert operation called the Phoenix Program which captured Vietcong sympathizers. In the Iran-Iraq war, SEAL teams conducted missions to counter Iranian mine-laying boats. The first military flag officer to set foot in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, was a SEAL in charge of all special operations for Central Command, according to the SEALs history page on its web site. The site says SEALs commanded Task Force K-BAR which oversaw the Navy, Air Force and Coalition Special Operation Forces at the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom which carried out more than 75 special reconnaissance and direct action missions, destroyed more than 500,000 pounds of explosives and weapons, identified enemy personnel and conducted operations that searched for terrorists trying to flee the country by sea. The largest deployment of SEALs in the group's history came during the Iraq War, with SEALs directing missions that included securing all of the southern oil infrastructures of the Al-Faw peninsula and the off-shore gas and oil terminals, clearing critical waterways so that aid could flow into the country. Several high-value terrorist targets were captured by the SEALs, including Ahmed Hashim Abed, the alleged mastermind of the murder and mutilation of four Blackwater guards in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004. Another recent high-profile mission came in 2009 when a SEAL team rescued the American captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, which had been hijacked by Somali pirates off Somalia's coast. SEAL snipers were on the deck of a ship and fired simultaneously three times, hitting three pirates who were holding the captain. Ultimate test . SEAL training is ""the ultimate test for a guy,"" said Chris Heben, a former SEAL with 10 years of experience carrying out missions in Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan. It's social, physical and psychological and tests how well the man can work with others given intense pressure and pain. SEALs train between 18 and 24 months, with the pinnacle of training coming during Hell Week, five days in which trainees are constantly cold, hungry, sleep deprived and wet. During Hell week, instructors deprive the participants of sleep, then let them hit the rack just long enough for REM to begin, said Brandon Tyler Webb, a former SEAL who ran the sniper program at the Navy Special Warfare Command and was part of combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instructors are constantly yelling, ""Go ahead, quit if you like!"" Many do. The attrition rate for SEAL training is about 90 percent, Heben and Webb said. Most recruits drop out long before Hell Week because they can't take the training, which involves running 15 miles, topped with a 2-mile open water swim and other intense physical conditioning, Webb said. ""Every day is like climbing Mount Everest,"" Heben said. ""You just keep doing what's in front of you. You don't look up."" Training instructors make you feel like ""you're part of an Indian tribe,"" Heben said. ""There's a lot of back patting and verbal reinforcement. You feel like you're part of something and you're doing great things. But they definitely let you know when you're not doing something right."" The discipline from SEAL training was intensely satisfying to Heben in his early 20s. He had gone to college, and though he was very bright, he was spending more time working out than on his class work. He was restless. Four walls and books just weren't his thing. Despite unimpressive grades, at 23 he got a job working in home mortgages making $63,000 a year. Then one day he read an article about the SEALs in Popular Mechanics. ""I enlisted in the Navy immediately,"" Heben said. ""I asked the recruiter, 'What is the fastest track to becoming a SEAL? I'll take that.'"" Though he won't discuss specific areas of countries where he's carried out missions, he said that he normally trained for missions on exact mock-ups of a targeted location.","Most of those killed in Afghanistan helicopter crash were Navy Seals, officials say .

"(CNN) -- A satellite and the unmanned rocket that carried it apparently crashed into the Pacific Ocean shortly after lifting off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Friday morning, NASA said. A protective shell atop the Taurus XL rocket did not separate as planned, slowing the rocket and preventing it from going into orbit, NASA officials said, citing initial information. The rocket carried a satellite, known as Glory, that was to have collected information to help scientists better understand the Earth's climate. The satellite and rocket apparently fell into the southern Pacific, they said. ""This is a pretty tough night for all of us,"" said NASA official Ron Grabe. The mission was designed to collect data that scientists planned to use to better understand how the sun and tiny atmospheric particles called aerosols affect the Earth's climate. NASA went into contingency mode about six minutes into the launch at 5:09 a.m. ET. ""Glory Launch: It looks like we have a problem with launch. Standby,"" NASA said on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- Donning her signature red updo and red lipstick and polka-dotted dress, 915 Lucy Ricardo look-alikes gathered in Jamestown, New York, on Saturday, setting a record for the most Lucys in one place at one time. Setting the ""Lucy"" record was just one part of a weekend's worth of events celebrating the comedienne and star of the ""I Love Lucy"" show's 100th birthday. Especially this year, ""we've really tried to stay true to (Lucy's) vision with as much comedy as we can pack into a weekend,"" said Journey Gunderson, executive director of the Lucy Ball Desi Arnaz Center for Comedy. Joan Rivers and Paula Poundstone were two of the headlining comics scheduled to perform over the event of several days in Jamestown, which also included a parade, a showcase for amateur comics and a performance by the Story Pirates sketch comedy group for kids. Now in its 20th year, The Lucille Ball Festival of Comedy draws diehard Lucy fans and comedy enthusiasts from countries as far away as Australia, Britain, Canada and Japan to tour the Lucy-Desi museum and Desilu Playhouse, two of the attractions at the Center. Instead of simply maintaining the grounds for idol worship, though, Gunderson said her goal is to create a festival that will offer ""new and contemporary comedy for years to come."" Gunderson's vision for the festival is one that she hopes will reflect the successful, progressive and still-relevant career that Lucy created. ""She was the first woman to ever be pregnant on television,"" Gunderson said. ""Lucy was the first female head of a Hollywood studio."" And in her comedy, ""she found a way to be clean, but still edgy."" She remained ""independent of societal standards."" Lucy Fest has always been a weekend to celebrate Lucy's contributions to comedy on what would have been her birthday. But in honor of her 100th birthday, Gunderson said a concerted marketing effort including social media was launched, and she expected anywhere between 5,000 to 10,000 people to participate in the festival. The increased presence will hopefully kick-start the ""programmatic expansion into truly being a center for comedy,"" she said. The festival is one of the four pillars in the center's plan to stay more true to Lucy's vision. The second pillar is developing educational programming for the comedic arts. Gunderson said they are in talks with colleges and universities about offering master classes and seminars in comedy. Pillar three is a comedy film festival that would pay tribute to Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's work behind the camera as producers of comedy. Gunderson says bringing a national Comedy Hall of Fame to Jamestown, New York, could be the ""most aggressive"" of the four pillars in their vision. ""We want Jamestown to be the Cooperstown of comedy,"" Gunderson said, though she acknowledges pitching Jamestown as a host city for the hall of fame as opposed to some better-known, bigger cities like Chicago or New York will likely be met with some laughter. And that's just fine with her. ""Go ahead and laugh,"" she said. ""That's the point.""","Fans come from overseas, around U.S. for New York event .

Trams are perfect for tourists and locals alike and can take you almost anywhere you want to go. ""We are budget travelers,"" Maureen McLeod said. ""We would strongly recommend taking the tram for both the low fare and the view of so much of the city which one gets, particularly from the front seats on the second level.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A top Mexican drug cartel suspect has been arrested along with 12 accomplices, including five women, federal authorities said. Police guard suspected members of the Beltran Leyva cartel  after they were arrested in a 2008 raid. Rodolfo Lopez Ibarra, known as El Nito and believed to be a top lieutenant in the Beltran Leyva cartel, was arrested Monday at an airport in Nuevo Leon state, said the Mexican National Defense secretary. Along with the suspects, officials said they also confiscated a Cessna 550 airplane, two cars, a large quantity of drugs and cash, firearms and a hand grenade. Soldiers acting on an anonymous tip arrested the eight men and five women, including one minor, National Defense said in a release Tuesday. Authorities said they confiscated 40,680 pesos (U.S. $3,150), $29,385 (379,507 pesos), 13 packages of marijuana weighing 13 kilograms (29 pounds), three computers and 28 cell phones. The Beltran Leyva cartel is one of the top drug organizations in Mexico, allied with the Gulf cartel in its battle against the Sinaloa organized crime syndicate. The Beltran Leyva group was formerly allied with the Sinaloa cartel, considered the largest drug-trafficking organization in the nation. The two other major drug organizations in Mexico are the Juarez and Tijuana cartels. According to media reports, someone alerted authorities when a tipster noticed heavily armed men waiting at the airport in northern Mexico. Ibarra was on a flight back from a baptism in Acapulco at which drug cartel chief Arturo Beltran Leyva had anointed him with the top post in Nuevo Leon, the news reports said. A published photo of Ibarra after his arrest shows him wearing a long-sleeved printed shirt and blue jeans, a forlorn look on his face as he gazes off to the side. Ibarra, 33, was the second top suspect from the Beltran Leyva cartel arrested in recent weeks. In March, authorities announced the arrest of Hector Huerta Rios, also known as ""La Burra"" or ""El Junior."" Like Ibarra, he was arrested in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia in Nuevo Leon state, along Mexico's border with the United States. Mexican officials also have recently announced the arrests of several other high-ranking cartel suspects as President Felipe Calderon wages a battle against a drug trade he says killed 6,500 people last year. About 2,000 more Mexicans are believed to have been killed this year. In April, authorities announced the arrest of Vicente Carrillo Leyva, a suspected leader of the Carrillo Fuentes drug cartel. A couple of weeks earlier, officials said they had arrested Sigifredo Najera Talamantes, a drug-trafficking suspect accused of attacking a U.S. consulate and killing Mexican soldiers. Talamantes, also known as ""El Canicon,"" also is suspected in attacks on a television station in Monterrey in Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex agency said. That same week, the Mexican military also arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant.","Suspected top Beltran Leyva cartel lieutenant arrested at airport in Nuevo Leon .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- President Ali Abdullah Saleh will return to his country Sunday, a homecoming that also marks the 33rd anniversary of his rule, a senior ruling party official said Wednesday. Zaid Thari, a political advisor for Saleh's ruling General People Congress Party, said the president's health is improving quickly and that Yemenis will celebrate his return. ""The Yemeni government all along insisted that Saleh's health situation was not major,"" Thari said. Saleh has been undergoing medical treatment in Saudi Arabia following a June 3 attack on the presidential compound that left him severely burned. But even during his treatments -- which included eight surgeries -- Saleh was under pressure to embrace a political transition plan developed by the Gulf Cooperation Council that included plans for him to step down, following months of widening anti-government protests and sentiment in his country. Thari said a massive celebration is being planned for the president's homecoming, and that Saleh will decide upon his return ""what is best for Yemen and the ruling party."" Officials in Sanaa have rejected calls for Saleh to leave office, saying that no power has the authority to force Saleh to step down. ""No one will lead the ruling party, only Saleh. He is the constitutional president and unless he steps down willingly, the Yemeni people will support him to the last man,"" said Abdu al-Ganadi, the government's spokesman. John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, visited Saleh in Saudi Arabia Sunday. Brennan wished the Yemeni president ""a speedy recovery"" but also ""emphasized the importance of resolving the political crisis in Sanaa,"" the White House said in a statement on the meeting. He urged Saleh to sign the Gulf Cooperation Council's political transition plan. Saleh has voiced agreement with the plan, which would ensure his gradual departure from office, but he has not signed it. Saleh told Brennan that the GCC initiative laid the groundwork for exiting the political crisis through national dialogue involving all political parties, Yemen's state-run Saba news agency reported. Ahmed Bahri, head of the political department at the opposition Haq party, said the United States was not doing enough and that they are forcing the people of Yemen to use force in order to have their demands met. ""The Yemeni revolution vowed to stay peaceful, but now is the time to review that stance. The use of force might be needed to oust the Saleh regime from power,"" said Bahri. Pro-democracy activists said that if Saleh is allowed to come back to Yemen, it would reveal the amount of hatred the United States and Saudi Arabia have for the youth revolutionists. ""The United States always said they supported the youth in Yemen, but we are coming to know that that is not true,"" said Waseen Qirshi, the spokesman for the revolution youth organizing committee.","President Ali Abdullah Saleh took office July 17, 1978 .

"San Angelo, Texas (CNN) -- Warren Jeffs' nephew and niece testified Saturday during his sentencing phase about the alleged abuse they suffered at his hands. The polygamist sect leader was convicted this week on two counts of sexual assault on a child. Brent Jeffs, 28, told jurors that his uncle raped him when he was 5 years old. ""He began to tell me that we were going to do God's will,"" he said Jeffs told him. ""This is between me, you and God."" Three jurors wiped tears from their eyes as Brent spoke, his voice breaking with emotion. Several also cried during the niece's testimony, in which she described an incident that allegedly occurred between her and Jeffs when she was 7 years old. ""He made me sit on his lap,"" she testified, and did ""inappropriate things to me."" She was crying so hard at one point that the prosecutor stopped questioning. Neither side pressed her for details. CNN is withholding the niece's name because she is the alleged victim of a sexual assault. Brent Jeffs has published a book about his life and has previously been public about the allegations against his uncle. Prosecutors say the penalty phase of the trial could last several days. The leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on his conviction of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who were his ""spiritual wives."" Jurors convicted him of two counts of sexual assault on a child -- charges filed after a 2008 raid on a ranch his church operates near Eldorado, Texas. Texas Ranger Jesse Valdez and Ezra Draper, who left the FLDS in 2003, also testified Saturday. Valdez identified a number of documents seized during the 2008 raid. Draper said he attended Alta Academy between 1978 and 1987, when Jeffs was principal. He described being summoned to Jeffs' office and receiving a lecture about his behavior, after Jeffs found out that Draper liked a girl at the school and had exchanged notes with her. Using a yardstick, Jeffs stroked the inside of Draper's thighs, tapping his crotch three times, Draper said. Jeffs then told him: ""Better that one of your members be cut off than the whole body be cast into hell,"" Draper testified. He went on to describe changes that Jeffs made to the FLDS, such as banning parades, dances, music and even the color red. During the hearing Friday, Jeffs said he objected to the introduction of items seized in the raid and documents that should get ""religious protection."" He requested to be excused from the sentencing phase to avoid hearing his religion degraded. Jeffs remained outside the courtroom Saturday. ""I am God. Cease. Do not present my holy ways as a thing of naught,"" the self-proclaimed prophet said before he left court Friday. ""Hear my warning as a full awakening.  Let my holy way be of freedom."" Deric Walpole, one of the defense attorneys Jeffs had fired earlier in trial, is representing him during the penalty phase. Jeffs represented himself during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial. He was silent during most of his 30-minute closing argument Thursday, mumbling at one point, ""I am at peace."" Texas prosecutors rested their case Wednesday after playing a key piece of evidence for jurors: a 20-minute audiotape that began and ended with a man saying a prayer. Prosecutors alleged that the recording was of Jeffs' sexual assault of a then-12-year-old girl in the presence of three other ""wives."" The girl had grown up at Jeffs' Yearning for Zion ranch, authorities said. Prosecutors showed the jury a photo of her with her arms around Jeffs, and a marriage certificate that listed the girl's age as 12 at the time. Jurors also heard audio recordings that prosecutors said showed Jeffs instructing a 14-year-old and his other young ""wives"" on how to sexually please him in order to win God's favor. Prosecutors said the 14-year-old was Jeffs' ""spiritual wife"" and conceived a child with Jeffs when she was 15. Jeffs could be sentenced to five years to life in prison on the charge of aggravated sexual assault regarding the alleged 12-year-old. For the other count, he could face a sentence of two to 20 years. Jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Their practice of polygamy, which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago, is part of the sect's doctrine.

"(CNN) -- France will begin the administrative process to extradite former Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega to the Central American country, the French foreign ministry said Monday. The ""consent of the United States"" allows the extradition process to start, the French foreign ministry said on its website. A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department declined to comment on the case and specifically on whether the United States gave its ""consent."" The former dictator will have a month to appeal the extradition after the French government notifies him, the foreign ministry said. Panama has requested Noriega's extradition to face charges he had a political rival killed. Last year a French court sentenced him to seven years in prison for money-laundering. Noriega also was fined almost 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million), the amount of drug money he was accused of laundering through French banks. Noriega denied the charges. During the trial, Noriega told the court he once had a strong relationship with the United States. ""I received high praise from the U.S., Interpol and other countries who all benefited from my fight against drugs,"" Noriega said. He also received the Legion d'Honneur from the French government when he led Panama. The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April 2010 after he spent 20 years in a U.S. federal prison. Noriega and his attorneys had argued the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989 in Operation Nifty Package. U.S. federal courts ruled against him. When U.S. forces invaded the country, Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. U.S. troops set up large speakers around the compound, blaring music at all hours, a psychological ploy to rattle the general. He eventually surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly escorted to the United States for a civilian trial. Noriega's U.S. sentence, originally for 30 years, ended in September 2007 after time off for good behavior. However, he remained in prison while the French extradition issue was decided. While in U.S. custody, Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke. ""On this subject, all I'm prepared to say from the podium today is that this is both a law enforcement matter and a matter of our confidential diplomatic correspondence, so I can't get into the details,"" said Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman.","NEW: A U.S. State Department spokeswoman declines to comment on the case .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexico's navy on Wednesday announced the arrests of 30 members of the Gulf drug cartel following several armed confrontations in the northern state of Tamaulipas. At least one marine and eight cartel members were killed in the firefights, navy spokesman Jose Luis Vergara said, according to the state-run Notimex news agency. The operations against the cartel were based on information from the navy's intelligence apparatus and the national intelligence agency, Vergara said. Authorities seized 43 assault rifles, 10 handguns, two rocket launchers, a rocket and 21 hand grenades from the cartel operatives. They also recovered 10 helmets and six bulletproof vests. The cartel members were holding 588,000 pesos ($47,000) and $393,343 in American currency, Vergara said. Those arrested were involved in drug trafficking, extortion and kidnapping, he said. The suspects were transported to Mexico City to be questioned further by authorities. The Gulf cartel is one of Mexico's major drug-trafficking organizations, based In the city of Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas.

"(CNN) -- Poland's former deputy prime minister Andrzej Lepper was found dead in his apartment in the capital, Warsaw, on Thursday, his party said in a statement. Lepper, 57, who headed Poland's populist Self-Defense Party, served as deputy prime minister from 2006 to 2007, as part of a coalition government led by the Law and Justice Party. He also served as agriculture minister. His party paid tribute to a ""distinguished politician, statesman"" who had founded and led the party and Trade Union of Farmers' Self Defense.

"(CNN) -- Still using crutches to walk, Tina Fletcher is the most recent victim of a gulf sturgeon strike while on the Suwannee River in Florida. ""I have been on the river my whole life,"" she says. ""For some freak accident like this to happen -- it's just crazy."" It was Memorial Day weekend when Fletcher and her boyfriend borrowed a friend's airboat for a joyride on the river. Fletcher was seated with one leg bent on her chair and the other leg stretched out straight atop a footrest when a sturgeon jumped in front of the boat. ""When the fish was coming down I was like, 'Oh my gosh, it's going to hit me!' so I went to pull my leg up, and when I pulled my leg up I made it about halfway -- like about my calf muscle,"" recalls Fletcher. ""Then the fish collided with my leg."" Jumping fish break boater's leg . The impact broke her tibia and her fibula, sending Fletcher to the hospital for the remainder of the holiday weekend. ""The report said it [the sturgeon] was between 4 and 6 feet and between 60 or 70 pounds,"" says Fletcher. ""But I think it was bigger than 60 to 70 pounds. It looked huge."" It may have looked huge, but it was a relatively small fish considering that gulf sturgeon can grow up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds. ""They're really bony, hard fish,"" explains Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) Officer Dorvan Daniel ""It's like an alligator on the outside of their skin. They're really almost as hard as a rock."" As the Fourth of July approaches, public services announcements warn of firework and campfire dangers, but near the Suwannee River in Northwest Florida the message to the public is: Beware of flying fish. ""We don't want to scare anyone off the river,"" says Karen Parker, FWC spokesperson, ""but we do want to make people aware that these fish they do jump and people have gotten injured by them."" In 2010 there were no injuries by sturgeon reported. ""We were hoping for another quiet year like that,"" says Parker, ""but we've already had nine encounters so far this year."" The encounters occur when a sturgeon jumps out of the river as a watercraft is approaching and just as the fish is on its downfall it lands in the vehicle. ""There's a bunch of theories out there, but we're not really sure why they jump out of the water,"" says FWC Biologist Allen Martin. The largest population of gulf sturgeon can be found in the Suwannee River, Martin says. The sturgeon travel into the river from the Gulf of Mexico every summer to spawn. ""The Suwannee is the last of what they call 'wild rivers' left in Florida,"" explains Parker, ""There's no dams or man made structures in it. So the sturgeons can get on in and up here."" Parker estimates that between 10,000 and 14,000 of these fish swim into the river every season. The spawning season takes place when the weather is warm, schools are on summer break and most companies are closed for the long holiday weekends. These factors contribute to the river's popularity as a place for people to celebrate. Daniel works hard to assure that celebrations do not turn into catastrophes. A few years ago, Daniel witnessed a sturgeon jump out of the water and hit a 9-year-old girl in the face. ""I heard the thump, and I saw a young girl fly out of the boat, not just fall out of the boat, she actually went up in the air,"" recalls Daniel. ""Probably about 15 feet up and out of the boat and she hit the water."" When the little girl was rescued from the water she had two deep lacerations on her jaw and neck, Daniel remembers. He guesses the sturgeon that hit her was 5 feet long and weighed about 70 pounds. Witnessing that accident has changed the way Daniel patrols the 30-mile stretch of river that he is assigned. In the past, Daniel would occasionally warn boaters about the dangers of the jumping fish. ""Now it's almost every boat I will stop and say, 'Watch out for these sturgeons, they are really dangerous,'"" he warns. ""I wouldn't sit anybody up front."" The front of the boat is where Fletcher was sitting when she was injured. Since her accident, Fletcher doesn't even want to be on the back of a boat on the Suwannee River. She admits it may take some time to get over her fear of the flying fish, but in the meantime she is trying to keep a sense of humor about her accident. ""I joke with everybody (who asks what happened) and tell them I was trying a new type of fishing lure -- I was trying my toes out to see how it worked.""","Sturgeon jumped in a boat, breaking Tina Fletcher's tibia and fibula .

"(CNN) -- The first democratically elected president of Zambia, who become the focus of a lengthy corruption trial during his retirement, died at his home early Saturday, his spokesman said. Frederick Chiluba was 68. He ruled the nation from 1991 to 2001. ""The death was a surprise for us because he was normal during the day,"" spokesman Emmanuel Mwamba said by phone from Lusaka. ""He met some people, had appointments and consulted. It was a normal day."" Mwamba said a doctor came to the former leader's home hours before he died after he complained of stomach pains. He was treated and appeared fine, but later became unconscious. He died surrounded by his wife and some relatives, the spokesman said. The former president suffered from heart problems during his retirement and had undergone treatment overseas. Chiluba took over after 27 years of one-party rule under strongman Kenneth Kaunda. In the early stages of his presidency, Chiluba became popular for setting up political reforms in the nation. He later resorted to an autocratic rule that especially targeted opposition rivals and outspoken journalists. An attempted military coup to oust him in 1997 failed, leading Chiluba to throw some of his opponents in prison, including Kaunda. After unsuccessfully trying to amend the constitution to extend his two terms in office, Chiluba handed over to his hand-picked successor, Levy Mwanawasa. Shortly after the successor took office, he turned on Chiluba and called for a corruption trial against him. A London court convicted him of fraud in absentia and ordered him to repay millions of dollars in government funds, but Zambia did not honor the ruling. The trial was held in London because some of the alleged corruption occurred there. Chiluba accused Britain, which colonized Zambia, of interfering with the nation's judicial system. Zambia acquitted him of additional corruption charges  in 2009. Journalist Chibaula Silwamba  contributed to this report from Lusaka, Zambia .","Chiluba ruled the country  from 1991 to 2001 .

"(CNN) -- A Bahrain court sentenced eight Shiite opposition activists to life in prison after finding them guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's Sunni royal family, state media said Wednesday. They were among 21 people who were convicted on terrorism-related charges in connection with the anti-government protests in the country, the Bahrain News Agency said. Soon after the judge read the verdict, the defendants protested loudly, prompting officials to forcibly remove them from the courtroom. Zainab al-Khawaja, a spectator, protested her father's life sentence by yelling ""God is Great."" She was arrested. Rights groups have urged Bahrain to halt the special military court proceedings, with Human Rights Watch deeming them a violation of international law. ""Most defendants hauled before Bahrain's special military court are facing blatantly political charges, and trials are unfair,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. In London, Britain's foreign office minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said he was ""extremely concerned"" over the sentencing and the nature of many of the charges. ""It is deeply worrying that civilians are being tried before tribunals chaired by a military judge, with reports of abuse in detention, lack of access to legal counsel and coerced confessions,"" he said. In a meeting last week with U.S. President Barack Obama, Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa said he is seeking national dialogue with the protesters. Bahrain's crackdown contradicts statements the prince made, Human Rights Watch said. Bahraini human rights activist Nabeel Rajab said he, too, disapproved of the trials. ""This court does not meet international standards for human rights and for fair trials. The people were sentenced for expressing their opinion and for opposing the government,"" Rajab said. ""This goes against the government saying it wants a dialogue."" Sheikh Ali Salman, head of the opposition Wefaq group, said Wednesday's sentencing goes against the conditions called for by Obama and the international community to restore calm ahead of any dialogue. Khalil Marzooq, a Wefaq leader, said the Shiite organization was reviewing whether to enter into national dialogue. He said the continuing crackdown and trials, not the protests, were hurting the country's international standing. Bahrain is one of several Middle Eastern and North African countries embroiled in anti-government protests. The ruling royal family -- Sunnis in a majority-Shiite nation -- accuses protesters of being motivated by sectarian differences and supported by Iran. Also on trial in Bahrain are dozens of doctors and nurses who are accused of taking control of a hospital during anti-government protests, storing weapons and holding people prisoner. The doctors, their lawyers and international human rights activists say the defendants were tortured to extract confessions.

"(CNN) -- Authorities have ordered the evacuation of some 12,000 people from the city of Minot, North Dakota, and surrounding areas because of expected record flooding, officials said Tuesday. The swollen Souris River flows straight through the city and is expected to overwhelm area levees, said Cecily Fong, spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. Minot, located in the north central part of the state, is the fourth-largest city in North Dakota. The evacuation order covers between a quarter and a third of the city's population, Fong said. Residents have until 6 p.m. CT Wednesday to leave their homes. ""We're going to become a pool,"" Minot Mayor Curt Zimbelman told KXMB-TV in Bismarck. ""It's hard to really believe, but I have some real concerns."" The National Weather Service has forecast record flooding and urged anyone living in the affected areas to prepare immediately for oncoming floodwaters. Heavy area rains and dam releases are causing the river to swell at Minot. ""The current best estimate for when water will overtop the lowest dikes in the Minot area is sometime on Thursday afternoon. However, a Wednesday night or early Thursday timeframe cannot be ruled out as the dikes become more stressed due to rising water,"" the weather service said. The river at Minot, which currently stands at close to 1,555 feet above sea level, is forecast to rise to 1,559 feet on Friday or Saturday -- which would be a new record.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods and General Motors have announced that they will conclude their nine-year endorsement deal at the end of December. World number one Woods is happy to have more 'personal time' with wife Elin expecting their second child. The parties agreed to a ""mutual and amicable separation"" that included a desire for more personal time for 14-time major winner Woods whose wife Elin is expecting their second child. And GM say the company is searching for ""budget efficiencies"" during a difficult economy. World No. 1 Woods has endorsed GM products around the world for the past nine years and has been heavily associated with the Buick brand in the U.S., Canada and China markets. The endorsement deal, believed to be worth at least $7 million a year, was to end in 2009. Woods' agent at IMG, Mark Steinberg, said the decision to end the relationship one year early was ""absolutely mutual."" ""It was a combination of things,"" Steinberg said. ""Tiger was looking to gain some more time, and certainly it was an opportunity for GM to reduce its spending with everything going on."" GM's vice president for North American sales, Mark LaNeve, says the separation is the result of discussions earlier in the year and is not related to the company's campaign for $25 billion in loans from the federal government. In a Web site statement, Woods commented, ""I am very proud of the long standing partnership I've had with GM and have enjoyed being a part of the company's dramatic product evolution. ""We've had a lot of fun together and I participated in some unique and rewarding activities.

"(CNN) -- Libya's rebel leader says he does not have a problem with Moammar Gadhafi remaining in the country, once he resigns and as long as he remains under supervision, according to a television report. Mustafa Abdel Jalil contradicted earlier opposition statements that Gadhafi's exit from the country was an absolute prerequisite to bring about the end of the months-long conflict. It signaled a possible willingness to negotiate with the Libyan leader to bring about an end to the fighting. In a Reuters Television report Sunday, Jalil made the comments while reacting to a proposal put forward by the African Union, which rebels have interpreted to mean Gadhafi should have no further role in the country's leadership. Jalil told Reuters once Gadhafi resigns, ""At that point he can decide if he would stay in Libya or abroad."" ""If he desires to stay in Libya, we will be the ones to determine the place and there will be international supervision on all his movements and communications,"" he said during an interview in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Jalil took the reins of the rebel movements after resigning from Gadhafi's government in February over what he saw as excessive use of force against demonstrators calling for the leader's resignation. Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim has previously said the prospect of a peace deal would be welcomed, but not one that rested on Gadhafi's departure. Libya's Deputy Foreign Minister, Khaled Kaim, noted Monday that talks between government officials and rebel leaders are continuing on multiple levels, including daily phone conversations. He expressed optimism that the talks could have a positive outcome if NATO's air campaign is halted. Kaim said Italian officials had granted travel visas to certain individuals to help facilitate the talks outside of Libya. But Maurizio Massari, a spokesman for the Italian foreign ministry, denied Kaim's assertion. The fighting in Libya, meanwhile, was slated to take center stage Monday at a meeting between NATO nations and Russia. The meeting brought together countries who support the airstrikes targeting Gadhafi's forces and one of the biggest critics of the bombing campaign. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was scheduled to meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev as part of the Russia-NATO Council meeting in Russia's Black Sea resort town of Sochi, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. ""The sole possibility of stabilizing the situation in Libya is an immediate cease-fire and the start of talks between the internal Libyan participants in the conflict with the support of, but not interference from, outside,"" the Kremlin said, according to RIA Novosti. Russia has been a critic of the NATO bombing campaign that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution for the use of force, with the exception of a ground invasion, to protect civilians. Russia, a member of the Security Council, abstained from the vote. ""Special responsibility in the search for a political-diplomatic solution to the crisis lies with regional organizations, above all the African Union, and the UN secretary general's special envoy,"" the Kremlin said, according to the news report. The meeting followed reports Sunday of fierce fighting in western Libya, where Gadhafi's forces have been shelling the towns of Yefren and Kikla, east of the rebel stronghold of Zintan. The shelling began three days ago, according to Mazigh Buzakhar, who works for an opposition media group. Buzakhar said clashes in the western Nafusa mountains on Sunday killed two rebel fighters and wounded 11. CNN cannot independently confirm Buzakhar's account. Conditions in the embattled towns in the Nafusa mountains are bleak, with no electricity and a shortage of water, Buzakhar said. Rebels have been battling Gadhafi's forces for months in an attempt to bring about an end to the Libyan leader's 42-year rule. The rebels received a financial boost Sunday when Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu pledged $200 million in support to the opposition. Davutoglu made the pledge during a meeting with Jalil in Benghazi, the foreign ministry said. The Foreign Ministry told CNN Monday that Turkey recognizes the opposition in Libya as legitimate representatives of the country, however, it does not mean the rebels are recognized as the sole representatives. Turkey has not cut off its diplomatic relations with Gadhafi's government, the ministry said. Gadhafi has been under international pressure to step down, and the International Criminal Court at The Hague issued a warrant for his arrest as well as for the arrest of his son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi. The warrants are ""for crimes against humanity,"" including murder and persecution, ""allegedly committed across Libya"" from February 15 through ""at least"" February 28, the court said in a statement. On Sunday, South African President Jacob Zuma traveled to Russia to discuss efforts to end the fighting in Libya, just days after he and other members of the African Union said they would not cooperate with the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Moammar Gadhafi. Zuma and others were attending a meeting of the International Contact Group on Libya -- a group of NATO countries, Arab nations and other countries working to bring about an end to the months-long conflict. The African Union said its members will not cooperate with the ICC's arrest warrant for Gadhafi, arguing that the measure jeopardizes efforts to negotiate a peace deal in the war-torn nation. The arrest warrant ""seriously complicates the efforts aimed at finding a negotiated political solution to the crisis in Libya,"" said a statement summarizing the countries' decision at a summit in Equatorial Guinea that ended Friday. Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the international court's authority, and the court does not have the power to enter Libya and arrest the leaders. Gadhafi has made clear he would not recognize the court's authority.

"(CNN) -- Actress Angelina Jolie, a longtime goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency, arrived in southern Turkey on Friday to visit Syrian refugees, a high-profile trip focusing attention on misery faced by ordinary citizens who have escaped violence in turbulent Syria. Jolie, who is scheduled to visit the Altinozu refugee camp, arrived at the airport in Hatay and was greeted by officials, according to the state-run Anatolian Agency. Hatay provincial officials had vans for the trip to Altinozu, and ""toys unloaded from the plane were loaded to one of the vans in her convoy,"" the agency reported. More than 9,600 Syrian men, women, and children have fled their country for Turkey to escape violence, including a military offensive in the Jisr al-Shugur area. Refugees at Altinozu are housed in warehouses at an old tobacco factory, and they staged a demonstration at the camp in solidarity with the many anti-government demonstrations occurring across the border in Syria. They held up signs that said ""Our military is killing its own people, please make it stop,"" ""U.N., help us please"" and people chanted ""stop killing children"" and other anti-regime slogans. Jolie was named a goodwill ambassador for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in early 2001 and has visited more than 20 countries ""to highlight the plight of millions of uprooted people and to advocate for their protection.""

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods offered glimpses of a return to the form that secured him 14-major championships as he fired an opening round 68 at the Bridgestone Invitational. Playing his first tournament for nearly three months after an injury lay-off, Woods finished day one in Ohio at two-under-par, six behind leader Adam Scott, of Australia. With three birdies and just one bogey Woods looked in good touch in his first competitive action since he dropped out of The Players Championship back in May. After his round he told Sky Sports: ""I felt good today, I hit the ball really flush. The hardest part was to control my distance. It was fun. ""I've got much more speed and compression through impact and the ball is taking off. I was hitting numbers I haven't hit before."" Asked what he missed most about being away from the game he replied: ""The competition, by far. ""I'm right there. Six back, three rounds to go I'll keep plugging forward and playing my way round the golf course. It's fun to be walking around pain free."" He fared much better than his playing partner, British Open champion Darren Clarke, who eagled the eighth hole but slumped to a seven-over round of 77. Scott is one shot ahead of compatriot Jason Day, who finished the day on seven-under after a bogey-free 63. American Nick Watney is third on five-under and nine players are a shot back on four-under, including Denmark's Thomas Bjorn and American Stewart Cink. Phil Mickelson is on three-under. ""I really enjoy playing against the best golfers in the world on the biggest stage,"" Day told the PGA Tour's official web site. ""I've always wanted to play on the big stage, and I'm finally here. I just want to keep the year going in the right direction. I don't want to go backwards. ""My putter was good all day. It felt like it was a boring kind of a game. It was down the middle, on the green, and every two or three holes was a birdie."" U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy, who said on Wednesday he is close to renewing his card on the PGA Tour in America, matched Woods with a round of two-under. On his potential return to the U.S. Tour he said: ""It's something I've thought about, especially after winning at Congressional. I'd like to give it another go. ""Ninety-five percent of me wants to come over here, and it was just making sure everything is in place by next year to make sure that coming over here and playing is as easy as possible logistically, get a place over here and maybe spend three or four months at the start of the year here."" The world's number one and two players, English duo Luke Donald and Lee Westwood, finished with opening round scores of 68 and 67 respectively.","Tiger Woods cards a two-under round of 68 on his return to golf .

"Paris (CNN) -- A French magistrate is investigating Airbus for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the mysterious 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 into the southern Atlantic Ocean, according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman. Judge Sylvie Zimmerman is presiding over the inquiry into the Airbus-made plane, court spokeswoman Sylvie Polack told CNN on Thursday. The plane fell into the sea while traveling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people aboard. Thomas Enders, CEO of Airbus, disagreed with the decision to commence the investigation, he said in a statement. ""On behalf of Airbus, I have noted the absence of facts supporting this step and stated our strong disagreement,"" Enders said. ""Airbus maintains that the focus should be on finding the cause of this accident and making sure it can never happen again. Airbus will continue to support the investigation, including the continued search for the flight recorders, which is the only sure way to know the truth,"" Enders said. Investigators have not yet established what caused the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found, despite an extensive search operation that included a French navy submarine. The plane went down in stormy weather, and most of the bodies were never recovered. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found led France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA revealed in a 2009 report. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, the investigators said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster. The area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The rough underwater terrain includes mountains and valleys, the BEA said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed from Los Angeles.","Air France Flight 447 mysteriously crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 .

"Tirana, Albania (CNN) -- Tension escalated in the Albanian capital Thursday as opposition members clashed with police outside the building where a commission is still counting votes from a local election that was seen as a crucible for stability in the Balkan nation. Members of the opposition Socialist Party attempted to enter the commission building by force. Police pushed them back. Protests also erupted in three other towns, including Kavaja, where roads were blocked and people burned tires. At issue is a razor-thin Tirana mayoral race in which the head of the opposition, Edi Rama, held only a 10-vote lead. A final vote tabulation by the Central Election Committee could tip the results of the May 8 vote in favor of the government candidate, former Interior Minister Lulzim Basha. Rama's Socialist Party has accused the ruling Democratic Party of vote manipulation and has asked to check ballot boxes. Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, urged a peaceful resolution. ""The narrow result in the mayoral elections in Tirana means that both sides need to reach out, overcome differences and find solutions,"" Ashton said in a statement issued Thursday. ""Developments today have shown the fragility of the political situation,"" she said. ""I urge all political leaders in Albania and in the city of Tirana to support the finalisation of the election process calmly, constructively and with a focus on the future."" Albania, a former Stalinist nation, abandoned communism in the 1990s but the path to democracy has been bumpy. Past elections have been criticized for not being free or fair. About 300 international monitors and observers were on hand for this round of voting, a test for whether Albania was ready to join the European Union. Albania submitted its application for membership in April 2009. The Socialist Party has won 70% of local elections, winning seats in other Albanian towns and cities. But Tirana remained in contention after a monthlong campaign leading up to the vote was marred by violence, including explosions, stabbings, beatings and threats. Earlier in the year, Rama, a three-term mayor of Tirana, had promoted protests alleging government corruption and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Sal Berisha. Four people were killed in the protests, for which the opposition held Basha culpable. The recent clashes and back-and-forth allegations stem from a longstanding political stalemate following a disputed June 2009 election, one that international diplomats are pushing hard for Albanian leaders to resolve peacefully. The country's supreme court, however, determined that those elections -- which returned Berisha to power --  were valid, and the ballots were burned by the Central Election Commission. Since then, tension has mounted between the government and its political rivals. Journalist Auron Tare contributed to this report.","Clashes erupt at the central election panel, which is tabulating votes .

Coughlan was working for McLaren when he was found to be in possession of confidential documents belonging to rivals Ferrari. The revelation led to his expulsion from the sport, a fine for the team, and the loss of all their constructors' championship points. However, last month, Coughlan was named chief engineer of the Williams team and he has told the official Formula One website that he is determined to make amends for his actions four years ago. Coughlan said: ""What happened was life-changing because it made me reflect upon myself and my actions.

"""Piers Morgan Tonight"" airs weeknights on CNN/US at 9 p.m. ET and on CNN International at 0200 GMT (live simulcast), 1200 GMT, and 2000 GMT and HKT. CNN -- Andrew Lloyd Webber told CNN's Piers Morgan that Michael Jackson wanted to play the title role in the film version of ""The Phantom of the Opera."" According to Webber, the King of Pop came to see the Broadway show multiple times -- years before the film came out -- and he and Jackson had spoken about a potential ""Phantom"" movie role. However, Webber said, ""People in those days were very worried that a film, if it was made, would destroy the Broadway or the West End show, and everybody would just go and see the movie. In fact, it's been proven to be completely the other way around. If you make a movie, it's just a great help for the theater. But goodness knows what it would've been like."" The seven-time Tony-winning, four-time Grammy-winning composer of musicals including ""Phantom,"" ""Cats,"" ""Evita"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" among others, is a guest on Friday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Webber also recalled another legend who had an interest in portraying the Phantom -- Sammy Davis Jr. Webber recalled being introduced to Davis by Liza Minnelli while in the south of France. ""I have never felt so ashamed in my life,"" said Webber, who said he was skeptical about Davis' ability to fill the role at first. ""For 2½ hours I heard one of the most consummate performances I've ever heard, and he ended up doing 'The Music of the Night.'"" Webber told Morgan he had hoped to get Davis to open the production on the Toronto stage but it did not work out. Webber also told Morgan the story of how ""Phantom,"" which is billed as the most successful musical of all time, came to be. Webber's fiancee at the time, performer Sarah Brightman, had been offered a role in a theatrical farce based on the ""Phantom"" novel by Gaston Leroux. Several months later, Webber bought a used copy of the novel at a book fair in New York. Today, Webber's musical version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is coming up on its 25th anniversary. A celebration concert in London is planned. The musical that catapulted Webber and lyricist Tim Rice to fame, ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" was called ""blasphemous"" when it hit the stage in the 1970s. ""We never wrote 'Superstar' to be in any way shocking,"" said Webber. ""We wrote it because we wanted to write the story of the man. And in fact, we really wanted to write a love triangle, because the whole thing was -- did Judas Iscariot have God on his side?"" Morgan pointed out the irony of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" causing a controversy when ""The Book of Mormon"" -- a musical that takes a cynical look at faith -- has just won multiple Tonys. Webber also told Morgan that ""Superstar's"" breakout song, ""I Don't Know How to Love Him,"" was originally entitled ""I Long for Kansas Morning."" When Morgan suggested that narrative was the key to the longevity of his productions, Webber agreed, and pointed out that ""Cats"" was a ""collection of poems by T.S. Eliot about cats that he wrote for his godchildren. Well, that was quite different, and we stitched them together with a vague story that we discovered that his widow had that he wrote, which was a sort of, forgive the pun, cat's cradle."" Webber told Morgan that the moment in his career that remains in his mind the most and that he would re-live if possible is actress Betty Buckley's performance of the song ""Memory"" on opening night of ""Cats"" on Broadway. Webber's current project is a stage revival of ""The Wizard of Oz."" He and lyricist Tim Rice have written several new songs for the production, which will also include the songs from the film. The musical will star Michael Crawford in the title role. A longtime colleague of Webber's, Crawford originated the Phantom role on stage. When Morgan asked Webber why he selected ""Oz,"" and how he knew it would fare well with a modern audience, the composer said, ""The trick with those is you've got to find a character to cast that the public knows. ""And of course, the role of Dorothy is something that everybody knows. And that's why we started with that. But interestingly with 'Oz,' it's never really worked in the theater before. And we looked at it very carefully, and came to the conclusion that what people had been trying to do was to stage the film, whereas what you really had to do is to go back and rethink it."" Webber said if he were casting his all-time ""dream"" musical, it would star Elvis Presley, but of all the people he's worked with in real life, Glenn Close as Norma Desmond in his production of ""Sunset Boulevard"" would be the hardest act to follow.

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Arsenal and Italian Serie A Udinese have been drawn together in the final qualifying round for the European Champions League. The two-legged tie will see last season's fourth place teams in England and Italy go head-to-head for a place in the group stages of Europe's premier club competition. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal have never won the Champions League, but have reached the competition proper in each of the last 13 seasons and were beaten by Barcelona in the final in 2006. Udinese played in the Champions League for the only time in their history during the 2004/05 campaign, when they were eliminated at the group stage. Wenger will be without France midfielder Samir Nasri and Dutch striker Robin van Persie for the first-leg of the tie. Van Persie, 27, was sent off during the match with Barcelona in March which saw Arsenal eliminated from last season's tournament, with Nasri handed a one-match ban for improper conduct in the wake of his teammate's dismissal. French coach Wenger will also be banned from the touchline for the opening match following his reaction to Arsenal's defeat to Barca.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan will review and possibly cut financial aid to China, in light of Beijing's growing economic power, the nation's foreign ministry said Friday. ""With China overtaking Japan in terms of gross domestic product, it is completely inconceivable for Japan, which has been outranked, to increase its ODA (official development assistance),"" said Japan's foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, on the floor of the parliament Friday. Last year, China overtook Japan as the world's second largest economy. Maehara also said he has instructed the ministry to conduct an official review of Japan's ODA policy for other countries, in light of Japan's economic challenges. The Democratic Party of Japan, the nation's ruling party, has been under increasing pressure to cut the country's spending deficit. Japan has the developed world's highest debt to gross-domestic-product ratio, nearing 200%. GDP is a broad measure of a nation's economic output. The government is also struggling with a dwindling worker and tax base, as Japan ages faster than any other country in the world, because of its long lifespan and low birth rate. Tokyo started extending aid to China in 1979, but stopped fresh loans in 2007.

"(CNN) -- Oregon Democrat David Wu officially resigned from Congress late Wednesday night in the wake of accusations of unwanted sexual advances toward a fundraiser's daughter. Wu, who was serving his seventh term in the House of Representatives, announced his resignation last week but postponed his official departure until after the House voted on the debt-ceiling bill on Monday. According to a statement released Wednesday, Wu notified Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber and House Speaker John Boehner of his resignation effective Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. ET. ""Serving as a U.S. congressman has been the greatest honor of my life,"" Wu said in his handwritten letter to the governor. ""There is no other job where you get up each day and ask, 'How can I try to make the world a better place today?'"" Kitzhaber announced Thursday that a special primary election for Wu's seat will be held on November 8, followed by a general election on January 31. Last month, Portland newspaper The Oregonian reported that the daughter of one of Wu's fundraisers accused him of unwanted sexual advances in May. Citing anonymous sources from inside the congressman's office, The Oregonian said the woman, whom it declined to name, left a voice mail message at Wu's Portland office alleging aggressive advances. According to the newspaper, the woman was 18 when the alleged incident took place in November and it was never reported to police. With House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi seeking an ethics investigation after that news and calls for his resignation mounting back home, the congressman's spokesman said last week that he would not seek re-election and was ""considering all options"" regarding the rest of his term. A day later, Wu announced he would step down. ""I cannot care for my family the way I wish while serving in Congress and fighting these very serious allegations,"" Wu said then. ""The well-being of my children must come before anything else."" The 56-year-old congressman, who separated from his wife in 2009, disclosed in February that he had sought ""professional medical care"" after dealing with campaign stress, his responsibilities as a single father and his father's death. The Oregonian reported that campaign aides had confronted him about his erratic behavior and use of medication during his 2010 re-election bid. ""I fully acknowledge that I could have dealt with these difficult circumstances better, and I remain focused on being a good father to my children and a strong representative for the people of Oregon,"" he said at the time. Wu's Portland-area district is heavily Democratic, and he won each of his races by double-digit margins. Rep. Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said his party has long dominated elections in Oregon's 1st Congressional District, adding that a Democrat has held the seat since 1975.  In the past two presidential elections, the Democratic presidential nominees -- Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts in 2004 and then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 -- carried the district. ""We are confident that a Democrat will continue to represent the families in this overwhelmingly Democratic district,"" Israel said.

"Chicago (CNN) -- Was Saturday night some crazy bad dream? Because the Charlie Sheen show I saw at the Chicago Theatre on Sunday night bore absolutely no resemblance to whatever it was the Detroit crowd and I witnessed Saturday. The entire nonsensical, rambling, random multimedia production? Scrapped. In its place: a live 90-minute talk show, with Sheen as the guest. From the start it was obvious a whole new show was planned. Gone was the sadly unfunny comedian warming up the crowd. Instead, a guy who never introduced himself to the audience was on stage at about 8:15 p.m. to introduce Sheen to Chicago. (I happened to recognize him since I interviewed him the day before in Detroit -- Sheen's tour promoter from Live Nation, Joey Scoleri). The crowd gave the headliner a standing ovation. Sheen replied, ""Wow ... wow,"" inserting one of his trademark expletives. The actor and the still-unknown-to-audience ""other guy"" (Scoleri) sat down in two chairs on a spartan stage, with the audience still standing and cheering, then chanting ""Detroit sucks! Detroit sucks!"" ""No, they don't,"" Sheen said into the mic. Scoleri was now the emcee, simply asking Sheen preplanned questions covering everything, including the ""goddesses,"" his marriages, his firing from ""Two and a Half Men,"" troubles with the law in Aspen, Colorado, call girls at New York's Plaza Hotel and why he pays for sex. Answer: ""I have millions to blow, and I ran out of stuff to buy."" It was classic Sheen -- caustically funny, crude, shocking and downright hilarious. He was relaxed and smoking and playing with audience members with the emcee as referee. He told the story of how he passed up being the original ""Karate Kid"" so he could take a much better opportunity in ""Grizzlies 2,"" based on his dad's unwise advice. Laid back and comfortable, Sheen became the guy Detroit came to see but didn't get. This was just funny, funny Charlie. Yes, booze abounded here, too. And throughout, the highly intoxicated crowd was so pleased with Sheen that many just shouted, ""(Expletive) Detroit!"" It was as though the packed house of about 3,600 fans in Chicago couldn't understand how Detroiters could have booed this show. I wanted to stand up and scream at them, ""Detroit didn't have this show!"" and then scream back at Sheen and the ""other interviewer guy,"" ""Can you please bring this show back to Detroit?"" iReport: Fans cheer Sheen in Chicago . Detroit was apparently some demented practice session. Here in Chicago, not much circuitous babble about Vatican assassins and trolls and warlocks -- some, just not 20-minute rants. Sheen felt the love and got his game on in Chicago. At the merchandise stand, I bypassed the shirt that said ""Sheenius"" and instead bought the $15 dog tag, which on one side says: ""Charlie Sheen's Violent Torpedo of Truth Defeat is Not an Option Tour 2011."" The flip side says....wait for it..... #winning. I'm wearing it now.

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova has the chance to win her first title in a year after beating current top women's tennis player Caroline Wozniacki in the semifinals of the Rome Masters on Saturday. The Russian avenged her defeat by the Dane at the same stage of the Indian Wells hard-court event in March as she triumphed 7-5 6-3 on Italian clay. The seventh seed will take on last year's French Open runner-up Samantha Stosur in Sunday's final, having lost in four title matches since her 22nd career crown in Strasbourg 12 months ago. The Australian sixth seed earned her first WTA Tour final appearance since losing to Francesca Schiavone at Roland Garros last year when she beat China's Li Na 7-6 (8-6) 6-0 in the opening semi. ""After losing in the final of the French last year, I did struggle mentally for a little bit. It's not always easy to see the positives of a tournament after you lose,"" Stosur told the WTA Tour website after beating the 2011 Australian Open runner-up, who was fourth seed. ""I had played some good matches over the last 12 months but wasn't able to make it all the way to the end again -- I'm excited I've done it here in Rome."" Stosur has lost all seven encounters with Sharapova, but none of those matches have been on clay. ""It's the first time I'm playing her on clay and her best results have been on clay,"" Sharapova said. ""With every year I feel better and better on it. When I was first on tour I wasn't the strongest, I didn't have the strongest legs and I didn't find it easy to recover from one match to the next, but I've improved on that."" Sharapova and Wozniacki both struggled to hold their own serve, but the three-time grand slam champion fired 36 winners to her younger opponent's 15. Sharapova, who has yet to reach a French Open final despite winning the Australian, U.S. and Wimbledon crowns, rattled off five games in a row to clinch the match after trailing 3-1 in the second set. She also beat Wozniacki in the last 16 in Rome in 2008, and now has a 3-2 edge in meetings with the 20-year-old after two successive defeats.","Maria Sharapova will play Samantha Stosur in Sunday's final in Rome .

"(CNN)  -- Reigning Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund opened the new season with a convincing 3-1 home win over SV Hamburg Friday night. Midfielder Kevin Grosskreutz scored twice with 19-year-old Mario Goetze grabbing the other goal with an impudent finish. Hamburg, who were second best for most of the match played before a capacity 80,720 crowd at Signal Iduna Park, grabbed a late consolation from midfielder Robert Tesche. ""We played really well. We took the foot off the gas a little in the closing stages, but there is plenty to be positive about,"" Dortmund defender Mats Hummels told AFP. Goetz, who has been rewarded by a call up to Germany's squad for Wednesday's international against Brazil, showed just why as he set up Grosskreutz for the opener on 17 minutes. Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa hit the post for dominant Dortmund before it was Goetze who set the stadium alight as he played a one-two with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and chipped Jaroslav Drobny in the Hamburg goal for the second. Grosskreutz sealed the three points with a 48th minute strike with Goetze again involved. He played a one-two with Kagawa and when the ball came to Grosskreutz  he shot home at the second attempt. Tesche headed home Hamburg's goal on 79 minutes after Kagawa had earlier cleared off the line. But Dortmund comfortably held out for a deserved victory which sends a signal to their other title rivals that they will be difficult to dislodge after their runaway title win of last season.

"(CNN) -- The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected Monday to visit a Nebraska power plant surrounded by Missouri River floodwater. The Fort Calhoun Nuclear Station, about 20 miles north of Omaha, Nebraska, is one of two in the state that has been getting increased attention from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission amid historic flooding along the Missouri River. The Fort Calhoun plant, which has been shut down since April for refueling, has as much as two feet of water in places. The plant's parking lot is among the areas flooded, requiring plant workers to navigate a catwalk to reach the plant. The other plant, Cooper Nuclear Station, sits on higher ground and continues to operate. NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko is scheduled to visit the Fort Calhoun plant on Monday morning. Although an inflatable water-filled structure called an aqua berm surrounding the plant was punctured by machinery early Sunday morning, key areas of the facility are not in danger of being flooded, the NRC and the owner of the Fort Calhoun plant said. ""The plant is still protected. This was an additional, a secondary, level of protection that we had put up,"" said Mike Jones, a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District. ""The plant remains protected to the level it would have been if the aqua berm had not been added."" Plant workers briefly switched to diesel backup generators to keep nuclear fuel at the site cool because water had gotten too close to electrical transformers, Jeff Hanson, a spokesman for the utility, said Monday. The plant was again drawing power from the electrical grid, he said. In addition to the berm, authorities have put in place floodgates, sandbags and other barriers to help protect the facility. As precautions, workers have been given satellite phones and extra food is stockpiled at the plant according to the NRC. Plant managers also have brought in additional diesel fuel should the site lose electricity, according to the NRC. The aqua berm -- an 8-foot-tall, water-filled berm, 16 feet wide at its base -- surrounded the reactor containment structure and auxiliary buildings, according to the NRC. A representative of the manufacturer is at the plant helping assess whether the berm can be repaired, Hanson said. With or without the berm, the chances of floodwater getting into the building where the core is kept are almost zero, said Dave Van Der Kamp, with the Nebraska Public Power District. The plant is designed to withstand water up to 1,014 feet above mean sea level, according to the Omaha Public Power District. The river currently stands at 1,006.3 feet and is not expected to exceed 1,008 feet, the OPPD said. ""We built the plant up high enough based on history, based on the flooding in the past. If the flood would rise for some reason above that level we have taken precautions, again, per our procedures to sandbag the important equipment for the reactors,"" Van Der Kamp said. It was catastrophic flooding from Japan's March 11 tsunami that knocked out cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, resulting in three reactors melting down and producing the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. This year's Midwestern flooding has also led to a spate of rumors about the Fort Calhoun plant that OPPD and the NRC have been trying to knock down. The utility has set up a ""flood rumor control"" page to reassure the public that there has been no release of radioactivity from the plant. An electrical fire June 7 did knock out cooling to its spent fuel storage pool for about 90 minutes, but the coolant water did not reach a boiling point before backup pumps went into service, it has said. Heavy rainfall in Montana and North Dakota, combined with melting snow from the Rocky Mountains, have sent the Missouri surging downstream this summer. The river washed over and punched through levees in northwestern Missouri, spurring authorities to urge about 250 nearby residents to leave their homes. The 6 to 12 inches of rainfall in the upper Missouri basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year's worth, and runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140% of normal, according to forecasters. The Missouri River is forecast to remain at record or near-record levels from south of Omaha all the way to Atchison, Kansas, into next week. The flooding is affecting communities in Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri.

"(CNN) -- Goran Hadzic, the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect still at large, was captured in Serbia Wednesday, a war crimes tribunal announced. An ex-Croatian Serb rebel leader who has been a fugitive for seven years, Hadzic was wanted for crimes against humanity and war crimes in connection with the wars that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. The former president of a self-proclaimed Serbian republic in Croatia, Hadzic is accused of trying to remove Croats and other non-Serbs from the territory and the ""extermination or murder of hundreds of Croat or other non-Serb civilians,"" among many other crimes, according to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. He was the last fugitive of the 161 people indicted by the tribunal. The announcement, also made by Serbian President Boris Tadic, comes less than two months after the capture of the highest-profile war crimes suspect still at large, former Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic. Plans were being made for Hadzic's transfer into the Tribunal's custody after the completion of legal proceedings in Serbia.  Authorities hope he'll soon be in custody at The Hague in the Netherlands, where the court is based. ""I welcome the arrest today of Goran Hadzic, the war-time Croatian Serb political leader of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina,"" Tribunal Prosecutor Serge Brammertz said. ""Hadzic's transfer into the Tribunal's custody is a long awaited development for the victims of the crimes charged against him. It is also an important milestone in the Tribunal's history. Eighteen years after the Tribunal's creation, we can now say that no indicted person has successfully evaded the Tribunal's judicial process. This is a precedent of enduring significance, not only for this Tribunal, but also for international criminal justice more generally."" The European Union and NATO welcomed the capture of Hadzic, with the EU saying it would help clear the way to Serbian membership in the club of nations. ""This arrest sends a positive signal to the European Union and to Serbia's neighbors, but most of all on the rule of law in Serbia itself,"" EU leaders said in a joint statement, saying Serbia was ""confronting the past and turning the page to a better European future."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Twitter that the arrest was ""an historic moment for international justice & the victims of war crimes during the Balkan wars of the 1990s."" Ratko Mladic was seized May 26 after more than 15 years in hiding and extradited to the Netherlands to face trial at the criminal tribunal five days later. He has proved an obstructive defendant, arguing with judges about who should represent him, and in a recent appearance, a judge ordered him removed from the chamber. His superiors during the wars that saw thousands massacred were Radovan Karadzic, who was captured earlier and is now on trial, and Slobodan Milosevic, who died in jail while on trial at The Hague. Brammertz said the apprehension of both Hadzic and Mladic ""mark a long-awaited step forward in Serbia's cooperation with the Tribunal.  Serbia has now produced visible evidence that cooperation with the Tribunal is not an empty promise but a genuine commitment and we look forward to Serbia's assistance with our ongoing work."" The prosecutor touched on the ""prosecution of war crimes"" in Balkan nations, saying they pose ""a critical challenge for the region and its people."" ""The Office of the Prosecutor will continue to use its best efforts to assist the fight against impunity in the former Yugoslavia, by providing national prosecutors with information, evidence and expertise. The international community also has a key role to play in ensuring that national prosecutions can successfully take over the Tribunal's work in establishing accountability for the atrocities committed."" Hadzic is the former president of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina and was indicted in 2004 for crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the eastern Slavonia region of Croatia in the early 1990s. The indictment against Hadzic said he was ""a co-perpetrator in a joint criminal enterprise"" -- the permanent and forcible removal of a ""majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from approximately one-third of the territory of the Republic of Croatia""  to make the land part of a ""new Serb-dominated state."" Under the indictment, Hadzic is charged on the basis of individual criminal responsibility for having participated in the following actions: . ""Exterminating or murdering hundreds of Croat and other non-Serb civilians, including women and elderly persons, in Dalj, Dalj Planina, Erdut, Erdut Planina, Klisa, Lovas, Grabovac and Vukovar. ""Imprisoning and confining hundreds of Croat and other non-Serb civilians in detention facilities within and outside of Croatia, and establishing and perpetuating inhumane living conditions, including repeatedly torturing, beating and killing detainees in these detention facilities. ""Forcing Croat and other non-Serb civilians to perform labour when detained or under house arrest in Vukovar, Dalj, Lovas, Erdut and Tovarnik."" He is also accused of other crimes against the Croat and other non-Serb civilian population. They are ""imposing restrictive and discriminatory measures,"" beatings, robberies and arbitrary arrests, deportations and forcible transfer of thousands, and the deliberate destruction of ""homes, other public and private property, cultural institutions, historic monuments and sacred sites.

"(CNN) -- Bahraini authorities have released more than 140 detainees, including two ranking former opposition members of Parliament and a prominent opposition lawyer, government officials said. The two former MP's are members of the largest Shiite opposition group, Al-Wefaq, which resigned from Parliament in February over the killing of pro-reform protesters, most of whom were Shiites. Former Al Wefaq MPs Matar Matar and Jawad Fairuz were ""tortured"" while in the custody of Bahraini national security forces, Matar said.  Following an interrogation with a military prosecutor, Matar said he, Fairuz and a few others were taken to what he believes was a military site. They were brought to an open area outside and told to raise their hands. Approximately five men began to beat them with sticks for about 30 minutes, Matar said. The beating took place after Matar said he had completed answering questions from a military investigator. The security forces ""didn't want information."" They wanted to ""send a message that we have a green light,"" to do whatever they want, Matar said. Nabeel Rajab, president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, said he believes  -- based on what people previously in detention have told him -- about 98 percent of people in custody had suffered physically abuse, including beatings, elect shocks and sexual assaults. ""No one was immune... very rarely will you find someone who was not abused,"" Rajab said.  There have other been credible allegations of torture by Bahraini security forces from human rights groups, including Physicians for Human Rights. Bahrain has not yet responded to a query regarding the treatment of the two former MPs while in Bahraini custody. Matar also claims he was physically abused on one other occasion and he was often interrogated for long hours and denied sleep.  My time in detention ""was a very tough period for me and my family,"" he said. But he still feels like a ""hostage.""   They have released us, but they ""can come and take us at any time."" Matar, who represented the biggest constituency in Bahrain, and Fairuz, a key lawmaker for Al Wefaq, are charged with spreading lies in an attempt to help overthrow the government.   Matar had been held in detention since he was taken from his car by armed men May 2.  Fairuz was taken seperately on the same day.  Mohamed al-Tajir, a human rights lawyer, was also among those released Sunday. Bahrain's ruling Khalifa family is Sunni Muslim, but about two-thirds of the country's people are Shiite. Some detainees were released for legal reasons, according to Bahrain's state media. Suspects in misdemeanor cases had already spent as much time in detention as potential sentences would amount to if convicted, Bahrain News Agency reported. Matar is not sure if he or Fairuz face further court hearings. Scores of detainees, including at least two women, went on hunger strikes to protest their continued detention without trial, activists said. Protests demanding political reform and greater freedoms for the Shiite majority began on February 14. Police turned teargas and firearms on protesters, who had occupied the Pearl Roundabout, an iconic landmark. Thirty-three people have died since the unrest began, activists say. Four policemen were also killed, according to the Interior Ministry. A military court has handed down harsh prison sentences from two years to the death penalty for charges including murder and attempting to overthrow the regime. More than 2,500 people have fired from their jobs for allegedly taking part in the protests, according to the Bahrain Workers' Trade Union. Bahrain is a strategically important nation to the United States, and it is home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.

"Orlando (CNN) -- What had been planned as an extended weekend work day in the Casey Anthony murder trial abruptly ended Saturday morning as the judge overseeing the case ordered a recess over the sudden emergence of what one analyst said must be a major issue. ""Obviously it's big, and obviously it's troublesome and obviously it's something that can't be disclosed,"" HLN legal analyst Linda Kenney Baden said. Judge Belvin Perry emerged from his chambers Saturday morning after nearly an hour of discussions with attorneys both in and out of the courtroom to announce the day's planned testimony would be canceled. He said only that the delay was due to a legal issue unrelated to complaints prosecutors raised first thing Saturday morning about expected testimony from Kenneth Furton, a chemistry expert the defense had planned to call Saturday. Anthony's lawyers are trying to discredit the prosecution theory that the Orlando woman rendered her 2-year-old daughter Caylee unconscious with chloroform, duct-taped her mouth and nose and stored the body in her trunk for a few days before dumping it in the woods. Anthony, 25, is charged with seven counts, including first-degree murder. The defense says Caylee accidentally drowned in the family pool and that Anthony and her father panicked and covered it up. In what has become a familiar strain during the trial, prosecutor Jeff Ashton complained to Perry that defense attorneys didn't disclose Furton's plans to testify about things that weren't contained in his initial report provided to prosecutors or mentioned in his formal interview with them. Perry has previously admonished Baez for failing to disclose planned testimony to prosecutors, going so far as to say he will consider contempt proceedings against him once the trial is over. Furton was to testify about explanations for vile odors and the presence of chloroform in the trunk of Casey Anthony's car, where prosecutors claim Anthony stored the body of 2-year-old Casey Anthony before dumping the remains in a wooded field. Chloroform can be given off by a decomposing body, and one prosecution expert described the levels of the substance in the trunk of Anthony's white Pontiac Sunfire as ""shockingly high."" Several witnesses also testified for the state about odors that they said smelled like the unmistakable scent of human decomposition. Furton did not provide specific alternative explanations for the presence of odors or chloroform in his initial report or in his interview with prosecutors, Ashton complained. ""Once again we are in the position of experts having supplemented their opinions without notifying the state,"" Ashton said. Defense attorney Jose Baez disagreed, saying nothing in Furton's planned testimony differed from his previous opinions. ""Mr. Ashton can continue to make these allegations and make these allegations and then suddenly they become true in his world,"" Baez said. ""But I do not believe they are true."" Perry indicated that he would not allow Furton to testify on Saturday, but didn't rule on the controversy before ordering the trial to recess until 8:30 a.m. Monday morning. But he did hint at his frustration. ""You would think this would have grown old by now but I guess some things never change,"" he said. Saturday marked the end of the fifth week of testimony in the trial, which began with opening statements on May 24. Perry lengthened Saturday's work day from the usual half-day in an effort to speed the trial's conclusion. He originally told jurors, who are being housed in an Orlando hotel shielded from media coverage of the trial, that the trial could last six to eight weeks. On Friday -- before Saturday's delay -- Baez said he expected the defense to rest on Wednesday or possibly Thursday. That would leave room for a rebuttal case from the prosecution and closing statements before the Independence Day holiday. It is unclear how Saturday's delay will affect those plans. Anthony could face the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charge, first degree murder. The charges against her also include misleading authorities and aggravated child abuse. Caylee was not reported missing to police until July 15, 2008, when Anthony's mother, Cindy Anthony, tracked down her daughter and demanded answers regarding Caylee's whereabouts. Prosecution witnesses described Anthony's behavior in the month after Caylee was last seen as nonchalant, testifying how she spent time with her boyfriend, went shopping and to nightclubs. Baez said in his opening statement that Anthony behaved as she did because years of sexual abuse by her father and had conditioned her to conceal the truth and hide her pain. George Anthony has denied the claims that he abused his daughter or helped conceal his granddaughter's death. CNN's Michael Christian contributed to this report.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Government ministers from the United States, Japan and South Korea will sit down in Washington early next month to grapple with the tensions in the Koreas, South Korea's Foreign Affairs Ministry said Tuesday. The ministry did not provide further details about the date of the meeting, but it comes as China continues to call for an emergency meeting of the six major powers involved in talks about the Korean peninsula. This diplomatic activity reflects efforts to lower anxieties in the Koreas, which have been at a boiling point since November 23. That day, four people died and 18 others were injured in a North Korean artillery barrage that targeted Yeonpyeong Island in South Korea's part of the Yellow Sea. The war of words got louder when South Korea and the United States launched joint anti-submarine military exercises in the Yellow Sea on Monday, a move that drew North Korean ire. Being North Korea's largest trading partner and strongest ally, China has been urged by the international community to confront the crisis. It has been meeting with both North and South Korea, and it has engaged in diplomacy over the matter. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said China has ""a duty and an obligation to press upon the North Koreans that their belligerent behavior has to come to an end."" Asked whether the United States believes China has done enough in that regard, Gibbs said: ""I don't know that I'm going to get into grading them, as much as I'm going to say that there's an obligation there, and we expect them to live up to that obligation."" A top Chinese envoy met with South Korea's president on Sunday, and a top North Korean official arrived in Beijing, China, on Tuesday, the first visit to China by a North Korean official since last week's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island. CNN affiliate YTN reported that Choe Tae Bok, chairman of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, is on a five-day visit to China. And over the weekend, China called for an emergency meeting of the six major powers that have been involved in talks about North Korea's nuclear program to discuss the latest crisis. The six are China, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and the United States. Hong Lei, a spokesman for China's Foreign Affairs Ministry, said Tuesday that such talks would be an important step in easing tensions. ""We made the proposal to ease the situation and to provide a platform for parties to have dialogue. ...To do this at an early date is in the common interest of all parties,"" he said. But right now, the idea is up in the air. South Korea said Sunday that it did not think the time was right for a resumption of the six-party talks but said it would ""bear in mind"" the Chinese proposal. In Washington, a State Department official said that the United States is consulting with its allies but that resumed six-party talks ""cannot substitute for action by North Korea to comply with its obligations."" The Japanese government said one of its envoys is in Beijing for discussions on the crisis. Amid the international attempts to avert warfare, the strident and saber-rattling rhetoric between the Koreas remained the region's background noise. North Korea warned Tuesday that the continuing military drills by the United States and South Korea could lead to ""all-out war any time."" The firmly worded message was published by North Korea's state-run KCNA news service. ""If the U.S. and the South Korean war-like forces fire even a shell into the inviolable land and territorial waters of the DPRK, they will have to pay dearly for this,"" the news service report said. The DPRK is the acronym for North Korea's formal name: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This comes after South Korean President Lee Myung-bak warned Monday that North Korea would face severe consequences if it launched another military attack across its southern border. ""If the North commits any additional provocations against the South, we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail,"" Lee said in a nationally televised address. North Korea stepped up its threats recently on its southern rival, as well as the United States, warning that military activities must not infringe on what the communist nation considers its territory. The crisis is top priority for Seoul. On Tuesday, the South Korean Yonhap news agency reported that Lee upbraided Cabinet members ""for not having the right sense of crisis at a time when South Korea's national security is at stake."" ""We should recognize that [South Korea] is confronting the world's most belligerent group,"" Lee was quoted as saying. Citing the country's Defense Ministry on Tuesday, Yonhap also reported that South Korea's military ""plans to toughen its rules of engagement with North Korea in a way that gives its troops greater leeway to determine the intensity of a counterattack by the level of damage and threats received."" And, a government official quoted by Yonhap said that owners of homes destroyed in the strike on Yeonpyeong Island will get more compensation than the standard amount paid by the government in the case of natural disasters. ""Due to the special circumstances of this matter, the amount of compensation will be more generous than usual,"" said an official of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security. The official said that the amount will be determined after discussions with the Finance Ministry. The agency said officials determined that ""29 houses were completely wrecked, five destroyed partly and 80 others damaged slightly from artillery rounds."" As for the Yellow Sea exercises, Seoul and Washington had postponed the exercises this month because of a tropical storm. The drills, which are to run through Friday, are ""designed to send a clear message of deterrence to North Korea,"" U.S. Forces Korea have said. U.S. officials have said the exercises off the western coast of the Korean peninsula are in response to North Korea's sinking of a South Korean warship in March. In May, a report from South Korea blamed the North for sinking the Cheonan warship with a torpedo, killing 46 sailors. North Korea denies sinking the ship and says South Korea and the United States are using it as a pretext to conduct the war games. North Korea's nuclear program as well as its military have long caused jitters in the region, especially during times of crisis. The country claimed Tuesday that it has ""thousands of centrifuges"" working to create nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but international powers are concerned about how the country's military would use such technology. ""The construction of [a] light water reactor is brisk in the DPRK and a modern factory for uranium enrichment equipped with thousands of centrifuges is operating to supply fuel to them. The development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes to meet the need for electricity will be stepped up in the future,"" the KCNA news service reported. The North Korean news service report seemed to confirm parts of a statement made last week by Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford University scientist. In early November at the invitation of the government, the U.S. scientist said, he visited a North Korean nuclear facility, which included 2,000 centrifuges, that was producing low-enriched uranium. Hecker said he was told that facility was configured to produce low-enriched uranium, but Hecker wrote that it could ""be readily converted to produce highly-enriched uranium (HEU) bomb fuel.""","NEW: White House spokesman says China has an obligation to rein in North Korea .

Doctors will conduct an autopsy Monday, and the boy's body later will be transferred to Ocala, Florida, for burial, Travolta attorney Michael Ossi said. In a statement posted on the actor's Web site, Travolta and his wife, Kelly Preston, described Jett as ""the most wonderful son that two parents could ever ask for and lit up the lives of everyone he encountered.""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Violence by extremists, widespread economic problems and significant failures in the judicial system contributed to shortcomings in Iraq's 2010 human rights record, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq said in a report released Monday. ""The human rights situation throughout Iraq remains fragile as the country slowly transitions from a conflict to post-conflict country that faces enormous development challenges that the Government and people of Iraq must now address,"" the report's authors wrote. ""Widespread poverty, economic stagnation, lack of opportunities, environmental degradation and an absence of basic services constitute 'silent' human rights violations that affect large sectors of the population."" Much of the concern over human rights involved armed insurgent or terrorist groups, according to the report. The U.N. mission said the 2,953 civilian deaths it attributed to armed conflict in 2010 came largely at the hands of insurgent and terrorist groups. It said minorities, women and children suffered disproportionately. Torture and poor judicial practices also remain widespread, the U.N. mission said. Defendants are frequently not told what they are charged with, have no access to lawyers and are held longer than legally allowed without trial, according to the report. ""The judicial system also remains weak -- and an over reliance on confessions, rather than on properly gathered forensic evidence, to convict encourage an environment where torture of detainees takes place,"" the report's authors wrote. Womens' rights also deteriorated, with so-called honor killings and domestic violence against women widespread and female genital mutilation widely practiced in northern Iraq, according to the report. The report also said security forces disproportionately target journalists, threatening freedom of expression. In April, the U.S. State Department released a report with similar findings, saying violence, corruption and organizational failings among government agencies, as well as actions by violent extremist groups, were contributing to significant human rights problems.","The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq releases a report on the human rights situation there .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah condemned the crackdown on anti-government protesters in Syria on Sunday, saying there is ""no justification for the bloodshed."" In a written statement released via Saudi state television Sunday night, Abdullah said the kingdom had recalled its ambassador from Damascus for consultations. ""What is happening there is not accepted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" the king said. ""There is no justification for the bloodshed in Syria, and what is happening has nothing to do with religion or ethics. The Syrian leadership could activate comprehensive reforms quickly."" Demonstrations against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began in March, and protesters have defied increasingly harsh efforts to put down the movement. Government troops and police launched a fresh crackdown last week, prompting condemnation from a variety of countries and organizations, including the Arab League, the United Nations and the Roman Catholic Church. Abdullah's statement puts the leader of one of the leading powers in the region behind calls for an end to the violence. In his remarks Sunday night, he said Syria's future ""lies between two choices -- either wisdom or chaos."" Syria is a longtime ally of Iran, Saudi Arabia's leading rival in the Persian Gulf region. Ties between Riyadh and Damascus also were strained by a January political crisis in Syria's former client state of Lebanon, during which Saudi Arabia gave up on efforts at mediation. And while Abdullah has condemned the Syrian crackdown, Saudi Arabia sent troops to Bahrain in March to help its neighboring Gulf monarchy suppress anti-government protesters there. Bahrain's Sunni Muslim rulers accused Shiite-led Iran of fueling demonstrations among the island kingdom's Shiite majority, an accusation the protesters denied.","The Syrian crackdown is ""not accepted"" by Riyadh, King Abdullah says .

"(CNN) -- Hours after surviving the shelling of a mosque at his presidential palace that killed a Muslim preacher and several guards, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on Friday insisted he is in good health and blamed ""gangsters"" for the attack. The president sustained a slight injury to the head in the Sanaa attack and he is fine, a senior government official told CNN. Prime Minister Ali Mujawar, the parliament speaker, the deputy prime minister, and the Sanaa governor were among seven injured, government spokesman Tareq al-Shami said. It was not clear if that figure included Saleh. A Yemeni official who asked not to be named told CNN that Saleh was in the mosque when two ""projectiles"" were fired during Friday prayers. He confirmed the death of Sheikh Ali Mohsen al-Matari and said four bodyguards also died. Yemen's official news agency SABA, citing a source in Saleh's office, said three guards and the sheikh were killed. In his televised speech Friday night, the president said the attack occurred as talks were taking place between him and affiliates of Sadeq al-Ahmar, the head of the Hashed tribe whose break with Saleh has been followed by spiraling violence. Protesters upset over what they regard as political oppression and government corruption have poured into the impoverished country's streets for months to demand that Saleh step down. A deal to make that happen, brokered by the regional Gulf Cooperation Council, recently broke down. Fears of all-out civil war in Yemen have spiked since, as government forces and people alleged to be Hashed tribesmen slugged it out in the capital. Their weapons have included missiles, according to witnesses. Eyewitnesses, residents and government officials say Hashed tribesmen carried out Friday's attack on the presidential palace. But the spokesman for Sadeq al-Ahmar denied it. ""The Hashed tribesmen were not behind these attacks on the presidential palace and if they were, they would not deny it,"" according to Abdulqawi al-Qaisi. In his speech, the president said those behind Friday's attacks were not connected with the youth-led movement in Sanaa's Change Square. Rather, he said that ""gangsters"" perpetrated the strike as part of their bid to overthrow his government and destroy Yemen's economic achievements. ""I salute the armed forces everywhere and the courageous security forces who are keen on combating the attacks by a criminal gang that is acting outside of the law and is not affiliated with the youth's revolution present in Change Square,"" Saleh said. Mohammed Qahtan, the spokesman for the Joint Meeting Parties, Yemen's largest opposition coalition, said that ""the attack on the palace was pre-planned by President Saleh to make people forget about the attacks that he has committed over the last two weeks."" Qahtan said Saleh's forces have ""bombarded most of the al-Ahmar family properties after the palace attack"" and have killed hundreds over the past two weeks. ""He is the only one benefiting from the attack on the presidential palace,"" Qahtan said. ""He wants people to feel he is oppressed and is defending himself and not attacking others."" The United States is monitoring what it describes as a ""very fluid"" situation in Yemen, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday. The White House also released a statement condemning ""in the strongest terms the senseless acts of violence today in Yemen."" ""Violence cannot resolve the issues that confront Yemen, and today's events cannot be a justification for a new round of fighting,"" the White House statement said. ""We urge all sides to heed the wishes of the Yemeni people, whose aspirations include peace, reform, and prosperity."" Catherine Ashton, foreign policy chief of the European Union, called for an ""immediate cease-fire"" by all sides. She said that she had activated a mechanism to expedite the departure of European citizens from the Arab nation, all while pleading for a resumption of serious talks to end the crisis. ""I appeal to all sides to protect civilians,"" Ashton said. ""I have urged President Saleh repeatedly to listen to the demands of the Yemeni people and transfer power. The only answer to the current situation is an immediate and genuine commitment to a peaceful and orderly transition."" Elsewhere Friday, government security forces and gunmen protecting protesters fought street battles in Taiz. The security forces began shooting at protesters assembled in that city's Freedom Square, and gunmen supporting the demonstrators burned an armored vehicle belonging to security forces. Abdullah Afti, a youth activist in Taiz, said four anti-government protesters had been shot during Friday prayers. Fighting has rippled across Yemen for months between supporters of Saleh and anti-government forces who want him out of office. According to the independent International Crisis Group, tensions escalated May 23 when fighting erupted between military forces controlled by ""Saleh's son and nephews and fighters loyal to the pre-eminent sheikh of the powerful Hashed confederation, Sadeq al-Ahmar."" ""The personal animosity and competition between the sons of the late Sheikh Abdullah bin Hussein al-Ahmar (Sadeq and his nine brothers) and the sons and nephews of Saleh have been a consistent obstacle to negotiations over a peaceful transfer of power. Now, this animus threatens to drag the country toward a full-scale civil war,"" the group said. The fighting has focused on these groups but ""it could easily escalate, drawing in other tribal factions"" and the armed confrontation has already led to the deaths of more than 100 people, the Brussels-based group said in a ""conflict risk alert"" last Friday. While Saleh has been unpopular among many inside his country, he has been a longtime ally of the United States in the war against terror. The United States has counted on his government to be a bulwark against militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, but it believes he should transfer power in order to maintain stability in the country. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said that John Brennan, the president's homeland security adviser, just traveled to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for meetings with government officials to ""discuss options to address the deteriorating situation"" in Yemen. ""Brennan said that the United States would continue to coordinate closely with both governments on developments in Yemen in an effort to help bring an end to the violence,"" according to the White House. With the level of violence escalating, Toner -- the State Department spokesman -- called the situation ""clearly concerning,"" but did not go so far as to refer to the situation in Yemen as a civil war. ""We call on all sides to cease hostilities immediately and to pursue an orderly and peaceful process of transferring political power as called for in the GCC-brokered agreement,"" the White House said. The Pentagon on Friday confirmed that American troops remain in Yemen for now, but may leave ""depending on the situation."" ""We're closely watching the violence in Yemen. We still have some U.S. service members in country, and we're taking the necessary precautions,"" said Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan. Lapan would not say specifically how many American troops are still in Yemen, but other officials have told CNN there have been about 100 trainers and support personnel rotating in and out of the country, helping to train Yemen's counterterrorism force. The Pentagon denies that those forces have been among troops that have fired on civilians. ""We have no evidence the counterterrorism forces we've trained are being used against protesters. We have seen reports they've engaged with armed forces, and we are looking for more information on that aspect,"" Lapan said. Barak Barfi, research fellow with the New America Foundation, told CNN the fighting in Yemen could destabilize Saudi Arabia by spurring a mass exodus to the neighboring country and emboldening al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to plot attacks. He believes Saudi Arabia, which has great influence in the country, is the only country that can help it avoid the specter of civil war. ""Riyadh exerts a strong influence on both Saleh and the tribes that have turned against him through the lavish patronage the monarchy provides Yemeni factions,"" said Barfi. ""If Saleh is compelled to leave Yemen, Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries that could possibly offer him refuge. The Saudis have sought to subordinate their role in the crisis under the auspices of the Gulf Cooperation Council, but must now take a firmer stance to prevent the complete breakdown of the Yemeni state, which would have regional repercussions,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- I'm somewhere between a car camper and an outdoor enthusiast. It did take me over 10 months of owning hiking boots to actually start breaking them in, but I know how to build a campfire and I'm not afraid of a few days without a shower. When my boyfriend, Matt, an REI credit card-carrying outdoor adventurer, mentioned he wanted to do the four-day, 31-mile North Rim hike in Yosemite in June, I was excited for the chance to prove that I was more of a backpacker than he thought. I expected to be challenged mentally and physically, and as time would tell, it was for good reason. We encountered almost every type of backcountry terrain -- me with a 30-pound pack on my back and Matt carrying a 50-pound pack. An hour into our hike, we met Mike and Rick, two men who coincidentally planned the same trek. Their companionship was a godsend to both groups. When I was safely out of the woods (literally), I talked to Les Stroud, the Discovery Channel's ""Survivorman,"" about our experience to see what we did right and what we could have done better. 12 Appalachian Trail secrets . The rockslides . We began on a trail where rockslides had overtaken multiple parts of the route, littering our path with large boulders. It would have been easier on a day hike with smaller packs, but we had to stay conscious of our body weight with the added weight of our gear on the unstable terrain. We reached a point where we had to head vertically from our location. It turns out when blazing the trail, crews began at separate ends and never met. We had missed the first marker telling us to head up the hill but now caught the second marker. Going up looked easier than it was -- recent rain had left the hill muddy and covered with loose rocks that were easily dislodged. For fear of us both walking into a dangerous situation, Matt decided to get both packs up to the trail before coming back to find a safer route for me. Luckily, Rick and Mike had hit the first marker and waited for Matt at the top of the hill. Without their help, it would have been a challenge to get both packs up to the trail. Survivorman says: ""When climbing over difficult terrain, look at what's beneath your feet. Step back and look at what's before you. You get a better picture when you step backwards and get a look at everything. It's also important in these situations that it's not about speed. Speed will kill you in a survival situation. If you're walking into trouble, walking faster means you walk into it faster."" Independence Pass a road worth traveling . A wrong turn and snow . With the rockslides behind us, the four of us hiked and made camp while it was still light out. I'll admit, I thought about calling the trip off that night. But the next day, we decided we could still accomplish part of the hike. The group agreed to cut the trip a day shorter and hike out a different trail. That morning was a steady climb through the forest and then up a granite slope. From the very beginning, we consulted a GPS, two topography maps and a compass. When we hit the granite slope, the GPS showed that we were a bit off, but still heading in the right direction to meet back up with the trail. With views of sharp cliffs striped with waterfalls and rows of steep mountains covered in trees, I joked that we had stumbled upon the scenic route. Even with the view, the granite seemed like it would never end. When it did, a huge expanse of snow stretched out in front of us. The rangers had mentioned it was abnormal to have snow in June but said we would hit it at El Capitan; this snow was much sooner. Our rented snowshoes combined with Mike and Rick's walking sticks helped immensely. With the snowdrifts more than 6 feet deep at points, Matt and Mike took the snowshoes to punch out a more solid path for Rick and me. As the afternoon progressed, we realized that we weren't seeing trail markers on the trees -- only two after four hours of solid hiking. The GPS and maps were also giving slightly varied directions, so we stopped every few minutes to orient ourselves. Survivorman says: ""If you know you're going off course, mark your trail. Blaze your own trail. Make deep snowshoes in a snowbank. Turn over or stack rocks. As you're going forward, stop, and look backwards because the trail does not look the same going back. If you end up doubling back and you don't do that, you don't have the perspective of what it's like going back. There's no harm in going back to where the blaze or trail was and really scan, like a camera in pan mode, to see the natural path of least resistance. That's probably the path the people before you took."" 8 perfect summer lake towns . Making the call . With our early start, we should have had plenty of time to cover the six miles to El Cap. After hiking a good four miles, it was still nowhere in sight. With snow on the ground and quick-moving storms possible at our altitude, we hit a turning point around 3 p.m. We could hear a creek but couldn't figure out if it was the creek labeled on the map. We continued to head east in hopes of finding the right creek, but the clouds were changing quickly and each moment we spent venturing meant a longer haul to a safe camping spot. From the very first hour, our group's motto was ""don't do anything stupid."" After weighing the options, I felt it would be a risk to keep plowing into uncertainty. Our group talked about the variables and opted to be safe rather than sorry. We made quick time back to a campsite we had seen earlier, an ideal, snow-free area with trees on three sides for cover from the elements. We set up camp and spent the night regrouping, changing our plans yet again. We would wake up early and double back to our old campsite, then take an alternate route, with creek crossings rather than rockslides, out of the forest. Survivorman says: ""Once you get into panic mode, one of the things you need is knowledge. You assess. What do I have on me? Am I injured? How much food do I have? You keep assessing outward. Internal, external, big external. Now you have knowledge and you can make a decision. Remember that survival is active, not a passive pursuit. You have to actively choose."" Creek crossings . We woke up at sunrise and set out following our tracks from the day before. With a clear trail of footsteps to follow, we covered ground at twice the speed. We hit our original campsite earlier than expected and soon were on the trail that led to the creek crossings. Fellow hikers along the trail told us we'd need to take our socks and boots off to cross the two creeks. Both had rushing water and rocky, often slick, beds. The first creek came up to our knees. The second was about 3 feet deep and 20 feet wide. When we hit the second one, we all gave each other looks that said, ""Really? Are we crazy?"" We had to cross sooner or later, so we decided on the safest route, and I took my boots off and hung them around my neck. Using walking sticks, I went in, testing out each step before I took it. The three men followed, and all of us emerged drenched from the waist down but with all our gear intact. Survivorman says: ""Keep your gear. Try to never abandon your gear."" We were ecstatic. We had conquered the last big challenge we'd face on the trail. You never know what you're capable of until you have no other choice; as a newbie to backpacking, that was probably the most gratifying thought I walked away with from my trip to Yosemite. Though we never completed our original route, the journey was worth it. With civilization less than three miles away, the sun shining and a hot shower and a cold beer waiting, it seemed like everything from that point on was a walk in the park.","A four-day, 31-mile hike along Yosemite's North Rim didn't go exactly as planned .

"(CNN) -- Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has backed Red Bull's world champion Sebastian Vettel to match the achievements of fellow German driver Michael Schumacher. Vettel, 23, claimed his maiden title during a dramatic final grand prix of the 2010 season in Abu Dhabi, while the 42-year-old Schumacher claimed seven titles between 1994 and 2004. Ecclestone, 80, said the competition faced by Vettel is much tougher than when Schumacher -- who now races for Mercedes -- was so dominant for Ferrari. ""The competition Sebastian is facing is much bigger than that confronted by Michael,"" Ecclestone told Formula One's official web site. ""That makes Seb's wins even more noteworthy. I don't see a reason why there shouldn't be a Red Bull era just as Ferrari had theirs with Michael."" Red Bull claimed the constructors' title in 2010 to complete a clean-sweep of the sport's top honors, and the British-based Austrian marque have been equally successful in 2011 with Vettel winning six of the season's opening eight races. Far from making the sport less appealing, Ecclestone is confident that Vettel's current supremacy increases fans' interest in the elite division of motorsport. ""Sebastian is in a similar position as Michael. Sebastian is the best right now and that's why he is dominating, and that's what makes it so interesting for the fans,"" Ecclestone said. ""Every race weekend starts with a big question mark -- who will be able to beat Vettel? That's why fans tune in."" Vettel, who also became Formula One's youngest champion with his 2010 success, extended his contract with Red Bull until 2014 in March this year, but had previously been linked with a switch to Italian outfit Ferrari. Vettel, who started his career at Sauber in 2006 before joining Toro Rosso in July 2007, said he admired the proud history of teams like Ferrari and Mercedes, but he insisted he was happy with Red Bull. ""I feel completely happy at Red Bull. Of course Ferrari and Mercedes do come with a huge legend, but I am not into myth right now. What's important for me is that when I come from the track and look in the mirror in my hotel room I want to be able to say, 'Yes, that's me and I am satisfied with what I see.' ""After Abu Dhabi it feels good to know that I don't have anything to prove to myself anymore."" Schumacher returned to racing with Mercedes at the beginning of the 2010 campaign, having originally retired from Formula One in 2006. The veteran driver has struggled for form since making his surprise comeback, with his recent fourth placing at the rain-affected Canadian Grand Prix a rare highlight. The 2011 season continues with the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on July 10, a race won last year by Vettel's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber.","Bernie Ecclestone believes Sebastian Vettel can match Michael Schumacher's record .

"(MentalFloss.com) -- As Napoleon Bonaparte expanded his new French Empire and conquered much of Western Europe, he doled out the spoils of war to his friends and family, whether they wanted it or not. Napoleon's older brother Joseph, described by historians as ""idealist, mild mannered, and lacking in vigor,"" had wanted to be a writer, but was instead pressured into following his father into a law career. His brother had other plans for him, and installed him first on the throne of Naples and later, Spain. King Joseph took both positions reluctantly, and didn't fill either very well. Almost as soon as he was crowned in Spain, a popular revolt against French rule began. Joseph suffered a string of defeats as he and French forces engaged what was left of the Spanish regular army, and he asked his brother if he could abdicate and return to Naples. Napoleon wouldn't have it, and left Joseph to keep a tenuous grasp on his army (the generals under his command insisted on checking with Napoleon before carrying out any of Joseph's orders) and kingdom. Unable to beat back the rebels and their English allies, Joseph abdicated his throne in 1813, having ruled for just over five years. Born to run . After Napoleon's defeat and forced exile, the Bonaparte name wasn't winning Joseph any friends in Europe, so he fled to the United States under an assumed and with the crown jewels of Spain stashed in his suitcase. He initially settled in New York City, then moved to Philadelphia, where his house at 260 South 9th became the center of activity for America's French expatriate community. He eventually moved to a large estate in Bordentown, New Jersey, twenty-five miles northeast of Philadelphia along the Delaware River. It was called Point Breeze. There, Joseph Bonaparte, former King of Naples and Spain, brother of Napoleon I, Emperor of France, took the title of Comte de Survilliers (though his American neighbors and friends still called him Mr. Bonaparte and referred to his home as ""Bonaparte's Park"") and went into quiet, suburban exile. Mental Floss: Andrew Jackson's big block of cheese . Mansion on the hill . Bonaparte may have been dethroned, but he was still royalty. He built up the estate to reflect his social standing. He constructed a vast mansion for himself, with a large wine cellar, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, elaborate crystal chandeliers, marble fireplaces and grand staircases. His library held the largest collection of books in the country at the time (eight thousand volumes versus the sixty-five hundred volumes of the Library of Congress). The land surrounding the mansion was elaborately landscaped and featured ten miles of carriage paths, rare trees and plants, gazebos, gardens, fountains and an artificial lake stocked with imported European swans. Bonaparte's home became a social hub for both his New Jersey neighbors, who liked to spend quiet afternoons browsing his library, and American and European elites. Among the distinguished guests who came through Point Breeze were John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Stephen Girard, a French banker from Philadelphia who was then the richest man in the U.S. Since Bonaparte's wife did not accompany him to America (he did not see her for 25 years after he left), another frequent guest at the house was his mistress, Annette Savage. Bonaparte had met Annette, the 18-year-old, French-speaking daughter of distinguished Virginia merchants, while he was shopping for suspenders at her mother's shop in Philadelphia. During their time together, Bonaparte and Annette would have two daughters, Caroline Charlotte and Pauline Josephe Anne. Mental Floss: How Teddy Roosevelt ended up with Abe Lincoln's hair . Fire . In January 1820, Bonaparte's mansion caught fire and burned to the ground. His neighbors rushed to the house and managed to save most of the silver and his priceless art collection. Contemporary newspaper reports called the blaze accidental, but according to the gossip around town, a local woman, an immigrant from Russia, set the fire as revenge for Napoleon's invasion of her homeland. Bonaparte was touched by his neighbors' assistance, and expressed those feelings in a letter he wrote to one of the town's magistrates: . ""All the furniture, statues, pictures, money, plate gold, jewels, linen, books, and in short, everything that was not consumed, has been most scrupulously delivered into the hands of the people of my house. ""In the night of the fire, and during the next day, there were brought to me, by laboring men, drawers, in which I have found the proper quantity of pieces of money, and medals of gold, and valuable jewels, which might have been taken with impunity. ""This event has proved to me how much the inhabitants of Bordentown appreciate the interest I have always felt for them; and shows that men in general are good, when they have not been perverted in their youth by a bad education. ... Americans are, without contradiction, the most happy people I have known; still more happy if they understand well their own happiness. I pray you not to doubt of my sincere regard."" -- Joseph, Count de Survilliers . [As reprinted in Bonaparte's Park and the Murats, by Evan Morrison Woodward (1879)] . Bonaparte rebuilt his mansion and remained in New Jersey. He took ill and returned to Europe in 1839. When he died in 1844, Point Breeze passed to his grandson, who sold it and most of its contents at auction three years later. Some of the furnishings and paintings are now in the collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Mental Floss: The girl who grew Abe Lincoln's beard . A night with the 'Jersey Devil' During his years at Point Breeze, Bonaparte believed he had a run-in with one of the Garden State's most infamous residents -- the Jersey Devil. According to the folklore of Jersey's Pine Barrens region, the Devil was born around 1735. Mother Leeds was in labor with her thirteenth child when the burden of the dozen she already had finally made her snap. ""Let it be the Devil,"" she cried as she pushed the baby out. The healthy baby boy in the midwife's arms suddenly changed before the women's eyes, growing wings, hooves, fur and a tail. The beastly baby screeched and flew out the window, making its home in the Barrens and haunting and harassing the people who lived there. As Bonaparte recounted the story, he was hunting alone in the woods near his estate when he saw some peculiar tracks on the ground. They looked like they belonged to a horse or a donkey, but one that was walking only on its hind legs. He followed the tracks until they ended abruptly, as if the animal had jumped into the air and flown off. He stopped and stared at them. A strange hissing noise came from behind him. He whirled around and came face to face with an animal he had never seen before. It had a long neck, wings, legs like a crane with horse's hooves at the end, stumpy arms with paws and a face like a horse or a camel. He froze, and for a minute neither he nor the creature moved or even breathed. Then, the Devil hissed again and flew away. Bonaparte later told his friends what happened, and they filled him in on the local legend. Until he returned to Europe, Bonaparte is said to have kept a sharp eye out for the Devil whenever he was in the woods, hoping to kill it and take the body as a trophy. Last to die . The Bonapartes had another American connection. Napoleon's younger brother, Jérôme, visited the United States in 1803 and fell in love with Elisabeth Patterson, the daughter of a wealthy Baltimore merchant. They married that same year, but Napoleon did not approve and ordered his brother back to France. Jérôme went home, annulled his marriage, remarried, and became King of Westphalia. But not before consummating his marriage to Elisabeth. She was already pregnant when Jérôme left the U.S. and gave birth to another American Bonaparte. The stateside branch of the family tree produced some notable members -- including Charles Patterson Bonaparte, Secretary of the Navy under Theodore Roosevelt -- but petered out a few decades ago. Jerome-Napoleon Patterson Bonaparte, great-grandnephew of Napoleon I, was walking his dog in Central Park in 1943, when he tripped over the leash, cracked his skull open on the ground and died.

"(CNN) -- Days after photographing scenes at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba, a U.S. Navy veteran found himself behind bars -- where he could remain for a decade -- for alleged passport fraud. Former U.S. Petty Officer 2nd Class Elisha Leo Dawkins was arrested in April, spending Friday like many others in a federal detention center in Miami. A federal indictment says Dawkins' failed to acknowledged that he'd once applied for a passport when filling out a new application, something his lawyer Clark Mervis calls an innocent oversight -- albeit one punishable by up to 10 years in prison, if he's convicted. His case has triggered an online and letter-writing campaign from Dawkins' supporters, including an effort to raise $10,000 for his release on bond. ""He put his life on the line,"" said friend Dianne Rinehardt, a veteran herself who met Dawkins in nursing school. ""I am not going to allow anyone to belittle his service to his country."" The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, via spokeswoman Marlene Rodriguez, declined to comment on Dawkins' case, because it is still active. Sarah Rosetti -- a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, which investigates passport fraud -- similarly would not address the matter because it was an ""ongoing investigation."" The grand jury indictment claims that Dawkins ""did knowingly and willfully make a false statement"" on an April 2006 passport application completed in Miami-Dade County. Specifically, Dawkins said that he had never before requested a U.S. passport, ""when in truth ... and as the defendant ... knew, he had previously applied,"" according to the indictment. The U.S. State Department calls passports ""the most highly valued travel document in the world."" The department opened 5,282 investigations into passport and visa fraud worldwide last year, leading to 1,680 arrests. ""Flash"" Gordon Schwartz, a Jacksonville accountant and a former Navy pilot, said that his friend Dawkins started filling out a passport application in 2004 but didn't finish it. When he filled out another application two years later, Dawkins checked ""no"" next to the question about whether he'd completed an application previously -- assuming that was the right answer, since his previous attempt wasn't complete. He got the passport. But five years later, in March, a warrant was issued for Dawkins' arrest -- at the same time he was in Cuba working as a military photographer, according to Schwartz. He returned to the United States on April 10, and was arrested nine days later, Rinehardt said. ""When you have a good-hearted person who serves their country and is doing everything the right way, we need to have some leniency,"" said Schwartz, who is trying to raise the bond money for Dawkins. Adding to the complexity of the case is the fact that Dawkins is not a U.S. citizen -- something that, according to his attorney, he learned only recently and did not factor into his arrest. Dawkins had been told by his mother that he was born in Miami, and he had a social security number and birth certificate, added Schwartz. His friend said he fears that, if Dawkins is released on bond (or even if he's exonerated on the passport fraud charge), he'll be detained and possibly deported to the Bahamas, where his mother hails from. But Danielle Bennett, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, said that the agency doesn't have a detainer for Dawkins, which would be used to keep him in federal custody on immigration charges. The questions of his citizenship notwithstanding, Dawkins has served in the U.S. military since graduating from high school, said Schwartz. That includes one tour of duty in Iraq as an Army photographer, before he switched to the Navy Reserves -- in part so he could attend nursing school, in hopes of eventually putting those skills to work in the military, Schwartz said. ""He is committed to the country. He's committed to always doing the right thing,"" Schwartz said of his friend. ""He's a leader, he's an overachiever, and he's super-friendly."" A document, provided to CNN by Schwartz as authorized by U.S. Navy Vice Admiral M.E. Ferguson III, indicates that Dawkins had secret clearance while at Guantanamo. In an evaluation report, one superior lauds Dawkins as ""a team player ... with a strong work ethic and desire to learn"" and recommends him for promotion. ""Dawkins is eager to tell the military story and to further the the image and success of U.S. service members,"" wrote Petty Officer 1st Class Sally Hendricks. Rinehardt, who said she had no idea where Dawkins was until this week, has started a fledgling Facebook group entitled ""Help Elisha be a Free Man!!"" to raise awareness and support. U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, a Massachusetts Republican, is one of those legislators who have received letters on the subject, while Schwartz said that U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, has taken particular interest in the case. Meanwhile, Schwartz said, the U.S. Treasury Department is among those federal agencies going after Dawkins -- for falling behind on his student loans, related to his nursing studies, while he's been behind bars. According to Mervis, a bond hearing is scheduled next week. Rodriguez, from the U.S. Attorney's Office, said that a calendar call hearing will take place June 28, at which point more details -- including a possible trial date -- could be finalized. Meanwhile, Schwartz said that his normally upbeat friend is struggling to keep up his morale while in federal detention. ""He's extremely upset, but he's dealing with it as best he can,"" Schwartz said. ""He just says, 'Tell me it's all going to be OK.'""","NEW:In evaluations, superiors give positive reviews of Dawkins, who had secret clearance .

"Paris (CNN) -- Former International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn may face new sexual assault charges in France this week, days after charges against him in New York appeared to be on shaky ground. In anticipation of those new claims, a lawyer in France for the former IMF chief said he had filed a counterclaim against French writer Tristane Banon for ""false declarations"" after the 32-year-old journalist and writer alleged that Strauss-Kahn assaulted her eight years ago. Strauss-Kahn's lawyer's filing was announced shortly after Banon's lawyer, David Koubbi, said he will file the criminal complaint Tuesday with prosecutors, who will determine if there is enough evidence to file charges. The legal fireworks came days after questions arose about the truthfulness of a housekeeper who alleged that Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her in his New York hotel suite in May. Asked about Banon's allegation, Strauss-Kahn's co-counsel Benjamin Brafman said in New York, ""I do not wish to comment."" Banon's mother, Socialist politician Anne Mansouret, said shortly after the housekeeper's accusations were splashed across front pages around the world that her daughter had been attacked by Strauss-Kahn in 2003 but that she had discouraged her at the time from filing charges against him. He was never charged in connection with the alleged attack in France on Banon. Mansouret, a member of parliament, said she cautioned Banon not to file a police report at the time for fear it would hurt her journalism career. However, in light of the charges against Strauss-Kahn, 62, after the alleged incident at a Sofitel hotel in New York in May, Banon's attorney, Koubbi, said a few weeks ago that he and Banon were considering filing a complaint. Koubbi said the cases were not connected. ""I don't see any reason why these two cases should be joined, because either the prosecutor has enough elements to condemn Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the United States -- and if he does, he should do it -- or he needs to bring two cases together to get a conviction,"" he said in June. ""In that case, we do not want to participate,"" he added. Strauss-Kahn's attorney in France, Leon Lef Forster, did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations in May. Mansouret described herself last week as ""the woman who embarrasses the Socialist Party."" ""I am ... a sort of collateral damage in the DSK affair. I knew for a long time that my political career was sealed with this bomb, but I didn't imagine that this bitter past could be revived so violently,"" she wrote July 1 on the Rue89 website, referring to the alleged attack in New York. Mansouret recently pulled out of the Socialist Party presidential primaries. Strauss-Kahn had been a front-runner for the party nomination until the New York arrest, and suggestions that the case was foundering have revived talk of his chances in next year's presidential elections. Mansouret said in May that, in 2003, her journalist daughter had interviewed Strauss-Kahn in his office in the National Assembly. However, after the interview, Banon received a text message from Strauss-Kahn, saying he was not happy with the interview and asking if he could speak with her again, Mansouret said. After Banon arrived at the address Strauss-Kahn had sent her, he locked the door to the room they were in, took her hand and grabbed her arm, according to Mansouret. Banon told him to let her go, and the incident ended with the two struggling on the floor, Mansouret said. Banon managed to escape the apartment and locked herself in her car, where she called her mother. Mansouret said she arrived about an hour and a half later to find her daughter still locked in the car and looking ""roughed up."" The heel of one shoe was broken, Mansouret recalled. But Mansouret told her daughter not to file a complaint out of concern that she would become known as Strauss-Kahn's victim. CNN does not typically identify sexual assault victims, but Mansouret said her daughter gave permission for her name to be disclosed. In New York, the prosecutor's case against Strauss-Kahn has been shaken in recent days after sources revealed that the housekeeper at the Sofitel hotel had been less than truthful with investigators. Within two days after the alleged attack occurred, she spoke by phone with a boyfriend in an Arizona jail in a recorded conversation. A source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that she said that ""she's fine and this person is rich and there's money to be made,"" as originally reported by The New York Times. The source also said the alleged victim had bank accounts in multiple states. ""She was getting deposits of several thousands of dollars at a time from people she knew, potentially involved in drug dealing,"" the source said. The 32-year-old immigrant has admitted to prosecutors that she lied about her whereabouts following the alleged attack, the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms, according to documents filed in court Friday by prosecutors. Prosecutors said Friday that the woman also admitted to lying about being a victim of a gang rape. In angry remarks delivered outside the courthouse, the woman's attorney, Kenneth Thompson, acknowledged problems with his client's credibility, but the bottom line, he said, is that she was attacked. ""That was true the day it happened, and it is true today,"" he said. ""She has described that sexual assault many times to the prosecutors and to me. And she has never once changed a single thing about that account."" The indictment and charges -- including criminal sexual acts and sexual abuse -- still stand. And, though Stauss-Kahn is now free to travel in the United States, the judge said authorities has continued to withhold the French financier's passport. CNN's Jim Bittermann, Susan Candiotti and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","Lawyer for French journalist says he will file a criminal complaint over 2003 incident .
