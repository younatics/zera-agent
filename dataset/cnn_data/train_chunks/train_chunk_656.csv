A university graduate was left 'humiliated' when he was asked to perform a dance at a job interview in a toe-curling scene reminiscent of spoof comedy, The Office. Self-confessed nerd Alan Bacon spent a week researching electrical high street store Currys in preparation for his interview as an £18,000 a year sales assistant earlier this week. But to his horror, all of his hard work went out of the window when he was told to make up a dance to an electro-pop record by French duo Daft Punk. The University of South Wales graduate said he would have been 'in his element' at the store in Cardiff because of his interest in gadgets. But his dream job quickly turned into his worst nightmare, when he was taken to a room with eight other applicants and ordered to dance. In a report in The Mirror, he said: 'I felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable. 'I ended up dancing to Around the World by Daft Punk, doing rubbish robotics in my suit in front of strangers. 'It was so degrading. I told my dad it was like a scene from The Office.' In the cringe-worthy episode of the BBC 1 . comedy, Ricky Gervais, playing the lead character of David Brent, . performs an impromptu disco dance to his stunned team, while humming the . tune of Disco Inferno. In an interview on BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Mr Bacon added: 'On the surface I really needed the . job so I thought I’m going to get this over with, I’m going to smile, . I’m going to do it. But inside it wasn’t a very pleasant experience. 'My . heart immediately sank because I knew that all the effort I had put in . to trying to learn the brand, what kind of gadgets they were selling. 'No, the first thing they asked us to do was to split up into two groups . and awkwardly dance with each other for them. Scroll down for video . Cringe-worthy: Fictional character David Brent humiliated himself in front of his team performing a dance . 'There . was an older gentleman there who was telling us just before the . interview that he was made redundant from his last job and had recently . had a child so he was pretty desperate for this job and (we were) watching him . having to dance to rap music.' When . he was first invited to the interview, the graduate in documentary, . film and television had been asked to prepare a short presentation on a . hobby. But when he did finally get to talk about his love of taking pictures of outer space, he said he had 'lost all dignity and all sense of . professionality'. Spoof: Alan Bacon said his experience at the hands of Currys was straight out of an episode of the TV comedy . Mr Bacon was contacted by the firm a few hours after the gruelling process had come to an end to tell him he had not got the job. Currys has since apologised for the what it described as a 'mistake'. A spokeswoman said: 'We . are extremely disappointed that one of the management team at the store . in question did not follow our official recruitment processes on this . specific occasion - formal processes that ensure we attract, inspire and . retain the right sort of people. 'We are investigating the store member who held the recruitment session.' Mr Bacon has so far had 300 interviews in his quest to get a job.

"By . Matt Barlow . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 4 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:30 EST, 4 September 2013 . Well, it had to be said. And it had to be said with some force by a figure of some power within English football. Greg Dyke had been turning the speech over in his head for two months, from the day he replaced David Bernstein as chairman of the Football Association. On Wednesday, high above London, on the 29th floor of Millbank Tower, he got it off his chest. Scroll down for video of Greg Dyke talking on Wednesday . Urgent changes: Greg Dyke highlighted all the areas where English football needs to be improved . English football is accelerating towards a great crash, Dyke warned, and the statistics are irrefutable. The Barclays Premier League is largely foreign and almost £500million was paid by English clubs to foreign clubs for foreign players during the transfer window which closed on Monday. The England team is under clear threat, he explained, but it went far beyond that. ‘In short,’ said Dyke. ‘We all have a responsibility to do our best to reverse this frightening trend because if we fail we will be letting English football down and we will be letting the nation down.’ Others inside the FA had been longing for this moment, too; longing to hear someone acknowledge the impending crisis rather than pussyfooting around, desperate not to offend a club from whom they might soon be begging a favour. Dyke was perfectly happy to enhance his reputation as a straight talking, no-nonsense leader, a bit of a geezer, while taking care to stress he was not offering the Premier League outside for a fight. State of the nation: Dyke admits the Premier League has become 'a finishing school for overseas talent' Whether it was wise to target World Cup glory in the Qatari desert in nine years’ time is another matter. A mirage, surely, but the 66-year-old FA chairman will be long gone by then, removed by the same age restriction that unseated Bernstein in July once he turned 70. Dyke’s nine-year plan will have at least another five years to run when he is too old for office, perhaps a reason for not wasting time. So, as Roy Hodgson prepared his team for Friday’s important World Cup qualifier against Moldova at Wembley, Dyke defined what a successful England team means to the nation. ‘Television ratings show this quite clearly,’ said the former BBC director general. ‘Club matches occasionally get audiences in excess of 10million when teams are playing an important match on free-to-air television. ‘But when England are playing in the finals of the World Cup or the European Championship, as many as 20million people watch a game.’ True, but many staunch fans put club before country and 10 per cent of the Premier League’s 20 members are from Wales. What do they care about the England team? Leadership quality: Jack Wilshere will be a key figure in the next decade of the national team . Dyke will form an FA commission to scrutinise all this and invite the chairmen from the Premier League, the Football League, the League Managers Association and the Professional Footballers’ Association on board. Upon hearing this, the Premier League noted that their participation would be down to their shareholders, the 20 clubs, to decide, which could happen at a meeting on Thursday. If not, in November. Just a hint of the logistical difficulties associated with bringing football’s powerbrokers together. Only last year, the Premier League cajoled everyone together to back their Elite Player Performance Plan, dedicated  to producing ‘more and better’ home- grown players. Memorable past: Dyke is hoping England can repeat their 1966 World Cup success in 2022 . They are investing £340m into this youth development scheme over four years, starting last year, and are not likely to let Dyke distract them. Player development is at the heart of the argument. Many of the issues would vanish if English clubs churned out hi-tech young footballers and were devoted to promoting them into the first team. As it is, foreign teenagers are targeted by clubs as they strive for better academy  graduates. This is one of the things top clubs hope the EPPP will offset. Amid Dyke’s blizzard of stats, a striking one was that only 35 English players Under 21 appeared in the Premier League last season, and he appealed to the nation, not as football fans, but as parents. ‘We will be letting down generations . of English kids who might otherwise have made it at the top level in . football but weren’t given the chance,’ he said. The . FA must shoulder their portion of the blame on youth development and . the  chairman sensibly accepted his own organisation must raise their . game, not simply complain that the world is against them. Dyke . also confronted his role in the formation of the Premier League as the . managing director of London Weekend Television, present at a dinner in . 1990 which proved the origin of the breakaway which shaped modern . football in this country. ‘What . none of us at that dinner could have foreseen,’ he said, ‘was that . because of the very success of the Premier League, 20 years later we . would end up with a league largely owned by foreign owners, managed by . foreign managers and played by foreign players and that, as a result, it . could be argued that the England set-up has been weakened, rather than . strengthened, by the creation of the Premier League. ‘I . am not being xenophobic but my job is to help ensure that English . football — and particularly the England team — is in a healthy state.’ And it is not. One glance at this qualifying campaign will support that. ‘Personally I think the situation is serious, very serious,’ said Dyke. ‘But saying that  is easy.’ Indeed it is. Still, it had to be said. And he’s got it off his chest. It is what happens next that really matters.","Foreign players hurting our game, complains Dyke .

Moderate to intense exercise was found to lower levels of harmful oestrogen waste products in the body . Physical activity reduces the risk of developing breast cancer because it changes the way the hormone oestrogen is broken down, according to a new study. The research, carried out by the University of Minnesota’s Department of Food Science, found that women who exercise regularly produced different oestrogen waste products to women who led a sedentary lifestyle. Professor Mindy Kurzer, who led the study said: ‘Studies suggest physical activity lowers breast cancer risk, but there are no clinical studies that explain [why]. ‘Ours is the first study to show that aerobic exercise influences the way our bodies break down oestrogens to produce more of the 'good' [byproducts] that lower breast cancer risk.’ The Women in Steady Exercise Research (WISER) clinical trial, involved 391 sedentary, healthy, young, premenopausal women. They randomly assigned the women to two age-matched, body mass index-matched groups: a control group of 179 women and an intervention group of 212 women. While women in the control group continued a sedentary lifestyle for the entire study period, women in the intervention group performed 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise five times a week for 16 weeks. Aerobic exercises included the treadmill, stair stepper or elliptical machine. The researchers adjusted the workout intensity for each individual so that the maximal heart rate was uniform among all participants. The researchers collected daily urine samples on three days prior to study and on three consecutive days at the end of the study. It has been known for some time that the sex hormone oestrogen plays a vital role in triggering breast cancer (cell pictured) They then measured the levels of three types of oestrogen and nine of their by-products or metabolites, in the participants' urine samples. The results showed that those who exercised produced more of by-product called 2-OHE1 and less of another called 16alpha-OHE1, which has been linked with a reduction in breast cancer risk. There were no changes in the levels of these chemicals in those who did not exercise. 'Exercise, known to favour fitness and improve heart health, is also likely to help prevent breast cancer by altering estrogen metabolism,' said Kurzer. 'It is very important, however, to decipher the biological mechanisms behind this phenomenon.' In collaboration with researchers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Professor Kurzer is now conducting similar studies in women with a high risk for breast cancer. The research was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research..","Study found that active women produced more of a 'good' oestrogen by-product called 2-OHE1 .

The hand-lettered donation jar on Anne Marie Fitzpatrick's store counter says what many residents of this well-preserved Victorian-era town are thinking and feeling lately: 'Keep Jim Thorpe in Jim Thorpe.' The surviving sons of the famous American Indian athlete have long fought to get the remains of their father moved from Jim Thorpe, Pa., to tribal lands in Oklahoma, where he was born, and they recently won a crucial legal victory that put them close to their goal. But Jim Thorpe isn't letting its Olympian namesake go without a fight. Residents and business owners are helping to raise money for the town's appeal -- to be filed later this month -- saying they have honored, appreciated and respected a man long considered one of the 20th century's best athletes. Scroll down for video . Jim Thorpe, an American athlete of Native American descent, is pictured in this undated photograph . In this photo taken on January 12, 2010, the tomb of Jim Thorpe is shown in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania . Hence the donation jar on the counter of Fitzpatrick's gift shop, prominently displayed between the cash register and a rack of cat figurines. 'We have no intention of letting him go,' said Fitzpatrick, an organizer of the town's annual Jim Thorpe birthday bash. 'There is a pride, and many, many people that you speak to as you go through the town share that pride.' Thorpe was a football, baseball and track star who won the decathlon and pentathlon in the 1912 Olympics, then later starred as the Indian in B-movies and struggled financially toward the end of his life. He died without a will in 1953 at age 64. After Oklahoma's governor balked at the cost of a planned monument to the athlete, third wife Patricia had Thorpe's body removed in the midst of his funeral service and sent it to northeastern Pennsylvania, where she struck a deal with two merging towns -- Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk -- to build a memorial and name the new town after him. His remains are kept in a mausoleum surrounded by statues and interpretive signage. Thorpe's son, Bill Thorpe, of Arlington, Texas, said his father expressed a desire to be buried in Oklahoma. Jim Thorpe throws the shot put during the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm. He won the decathlon and pentathlon at the games, taking first place in six events, including the shot put . Jim Thorpe goes into training at his home in Inglewood, California, where he does miles of roadwork daily. He is shown carrying his sons: Phil, age 4, and Billy, age 3 . 'All this time we've wanted his body back because of the way that it was taken away from us,' he said. 'And we had no authority.' In April, U.S. District Judge Richard Caputo ruled in favor of Thorpe, his brother Richard, and the Sac and Fox tribe to which their father belonged, saying the town amounts to a museum under the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The borough council voted to appeal the ruling to the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and written arguments are due Sept. 23. The town has found support from Jim Thorpe's grandsons, who say it has done right by him. 'The town has done nothing but honor and respect and love my grandpa,' said John Thorpe, of Lake Tahoe, Calif. 'The state of Oklahoma did not want to erect a mausoleum or do anything to honor him. They weren't willing to do what the town of Jim Thorpe did.' The surviving sons of famed American Indian athlete Jim Thorpe won a crucial legal victory in April 2013 that put them close to their goal of bringing their father's remains from the Pennsylvania town named for him to tribal lands in Oklahoma, where he was born . Thorpe said he was taking part in a sweat lodge ceremony in Texas three years ago when, unbidden, a medicine man told him his grandfather had made contact and said, 'I am at peace, and I want no more pain created in my name.' He said that helped confirm his belief that his grandfather's tomb should remain where it is. So what will happen if Thorpe's body is no longer there? The borough on the western edge of Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains is popular with tourists and frequently appears on lists of America's prettiest towns. But that is due largely to its vibrant main street, stunning mansions and location at the bottom of a steep gorge carved by the Lehigh River. Few come specifically to visit Thorpe's roadside memorial, and the town's economy certainly isn't dependent on its connection to the man. Legendary athlete Jim Thorpe is pictured in boxing gear on June 26, 1935 . Thorpe is pictured in a baseball uniform in 1914. He died without a will in 1953 at age 64 . But the psychological loss will be undeniable. The athlete who never set foot in the town named after him has become an important part of its identity. The high school's athletic teams are named, after all, the Olympians. 'Look, if it turns out that Jim Thorpe is going to be transported somewhere else, then let's accompany him and make it as graceful and honorable a transition as it could possibly be,' said Dan Hugos, co-owner of the Mauch Chunk Opera House in Jim Thorpe. 'And let's shake the hands of the new people who are going to be caring for him. But we will still continue to do our part to remember who he was and remember his name.'","The surviving sons of the famous .

The only noticeable difference between four-year-old Owen and the other children in the playground is his oversized uniform - the smallest available - as he is still catching up with his growth. Ms Piper, 29, from Minster, Kent, said: ‘Owen is so excited about school - every day he asked me “is it school yet mummy?” ‘He’s such an inspiration to me - I look at him every day and think he’s gone through so much already, but he’s just not fazed by anything. ‘It was the deepest, darkest time of my life when Owen was in hospital. ‘The only way to describe what we went through is that it was like being on a rollercoaster. Owen (pictured shortly after his birth) spent 17 weeks in intensive care after his birth in July 2009. He was eventually discharged on November 2 - the day after his due date . Owen has now started at St George's Primary School in Sheerness, Kent. He is still smaller than his peers and has lung disease but he is expected to fully recover by the time he is seven . ‘One day Owen would be doing really well and the next he would be at death’s door. ‘He’s come on leaps and bounds and he’s a proper little character. His talking is just phenomenal - he’s a real chatterbox. ‘I never in a million years thought he would go to a mainstream school, I always thought he’d be behind in something.’ Owen was born at Medway Maritime Hospital on July 10, 2009, and finally allowed home on November 2, the day after his due date. When Owen was born he was so small that his head was only as big as an egg. His first woolly hat is pictured on an egg cup . Owen's mother, Hayley Piper, said: 'He's such an inspiration to me - I look at him every day and think he's gone through so much.'

He remained on oxygen for six months and still suffers from chronic lung disease, but doctors say that this problem should clear up by the time he is seven. The toddler has now been officially signed off by Medway Maritime Hospital and last winter was the first he did not have to be admitted to hospital after becoming unwell.

A little boy who has spent most of his life in hospital is now living at home for the first time. This week, 18-month-old James French left Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, for his family home, thanks to a portable ventilator and the hard work of medical staff at three hospitals. James was born five weeks before his due date. He survived his premature birth only for medics to discover he had a condition which meant his ribs were suffocating him. James French (pictured with his mother, Lorraine Lowry), 18-months, has just been discharged from Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool where he has spent his whole life . A series of scans revealed he had chest and spinal problems that restricted his breathing and distorted the organs in his chest. But after several operations, he has finally gone to live at home in Hawarden, North Wales. James’ mother, Lorraine Lowry, gave birth at the Countess of Chester Hospital, was then transferred to Liverpool Women’s Hospital and then to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, where James has spent almost all of his life. The 33-year-old said: ‘I went into hospital at 35 weeks and staff said they detected “reduced activity” and had to deliver him. ‘The whole process only took about 40 minutes from getting in there to the procedure. ‘Afterwards, they told me that if they hadn’t delivered him there and then, he’d have had 20 minutes to live. ‘They had to get him out or he wouldn’t have survived. ‘He . was intubated and transferred to Liverpool Women’s Hospital. We were . there for about 20 days. They tried to take him off the ventilator a few . times but it just didn’t happen. James was born five weeks before his due date. He survived his premature birth only for medics to discover he had a condition which meant his ribs were suffocating him . ‘And it was only meant to be a visit to Alder Hey but he ended up staying there for almost 18 months.’ Ms Lowry, an administration worker, and her partner Paul ‘Frankie’ French, 37, a plumber, found their lives split between Hawarden and Liverpool. Ms Lowry added: ‘Basically, James’ heart was being pushed on to the right side. His left lung was small, and his heart was compressing the right lung so he couldn’t get enough air. ‘They described the problem as life-limiting chest and vertebrae anomalies. His ribs were fused in an unusual way. It’s very rare. ‘The way they described it was that . the ribs looked like they were the opposite way round to everybody . else's. It causes major complications.’ When James was seven-and-a-half months, medics presented his parents with a stark choice. Ms Lowry said: ‘This is so unusual it was uncharted territory. ‘Staff . at Alder Hey wrote to Great Ormond Street in London to find out if . there was anything else they could do - but the answer was no. Ms Lowry said: 'Basically, James' heart was being pushed on to the right side. His left lung was small, and his heart was compressing the right lung so he couldn't get enough air. James is pictured with his parents, Lorraine and Paul . ‘So they told us the only alternative to a tracheotomy and long-term ventilation was to turn the machine off. ‘For us there was no question.’ The family opted for long-term ventilation and an action plan was put in place. It took six months for Alder Hey to put together a care package, which involved training up six staff to handle James’ equipment, to allow the little boy to go home. Ms Lowry said: ‘It didn’t seem like it at the time but they said it was the fastest package they’d ever put together. James (pictured with his father, Paul French) has only been able to go home thanks to a portable ventilator . ‘At the time I was pretty much living in a flat set aside for parents’ accommodation. ‘We . wanted to go home. It was tiring for us, but we were concerned about . James, too. The longer you are in hospital the more vulnerable you are . to bugs. ‘James did catch an infection on the ward and he almost died. He fought it and pulled through.’ Returning to their Hawarden home was a relief. She said: ‘It’s an amazing feeling to know he’s under the same roof. We can wake up and know he’s in the next room. ‘We go back to Alder Hey for checks and procedures and he’s still under their care.’ James may need surgery to open his ribcage up if the bones put more pressure on his organs but he is exceeding every expectation. Ms Lowry said: ‘There were worries the problems could stop him speaking, but it hasn’t slowed his development at all and we’re so grateful for that. He’s taking a few steps but we don’t know if he’ll be able to walk in future.’ Although James is reliant on the ventilator, he can get out and about and has been on trips to the park and a farmyard. Ms Lowry said: ‘He’s constantly happy. I’ve never seen a child so happy. He’s always smiling. ‘He loves TV but most of all he wants to play. To him it’s real life. He’ll watch other kids out and about and we know he wants to join in. He runs around. ‘If his breathing tube gets looped around his feet, he just steps out of it. He’s so calm while we’ll be panicking. ‘The doctors are amazed at how he’s come on. ‘But as Paul says, we think he’s going to show everyone.’","James French was born five weeks early at Countess of Chester Hospital .

As two of the world's most celebrated photographers, Bruce Weber and David Bailey have each had their fair share of challenging scenarios. But a new project for Nokia presented one that neither had encountered before. Working with a smartphone - namely the new Lumia 1020 - instead of their usual cameras. In a glimpse from behind the scenes on the shoot in Harlem, New York, earlier this summer, Mr Weber is seen using the new handset to capture Mr Bailey with two of the borough's locals. Legends on location: Bruce Weber is seen taking a snap of fellow photographer David Bailey with two Harlem locals using a smartphone during their first shoot together on July 18 . By all accounts, the pair had a blast . working with one another - despite the fact that it turned out to be one . of the hottest days of the year. Not that the heat even caused Mr Bailey, 75, to break a sweat, he told MailOnline in an . interview afterwards. 'There was this bunch of kids who opened up the fire hydrant - and guess . who was in it with all the kids? David!' Dismissing our concern over the searing temperatures, he said: 'I've been in hotter places. . . Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, India, Ethiopia - everywhere! 'It was memorable spending the day in . Harlem with Bruce showing me around.' Indeed, for Mr Weber, 67, revisiting Harlem was a trip down memory lane. 'I've . always loved it, it's always been my favorite place in New York City. . .' he said. 'I've just always enjoyed the people . up there, the way they dress. I've gone to church up there a couple of . times. . . I always have an amazing time.' And those summer temperatures, he added, were actually more help than hindrance when it came to capturing the locals. Longtime friends: Bruce Weber at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in February (left) and David Bailey in London in May last year (right) 'I think the heat really brought a lot of people out, you know, in a different way,' he said. 'Some people were in bathing suits, some people were in big hats - it's kinda crazy! The other side of the camera: Bruce Weber pictured in 2005 ahead of the release of his book Blood, Sweat and Tears .

I got soaking wet too! We . weren't so worried about the cameras!' Not . that Mr Bailey would have even worried much with his usual kit. 'The . camera I use is pretty waterproof anyway - it should be for what it . cost,' he added. Using a smartphone to take pictures . was not a foreign concept for Mr Bailey, who says that 'if it takes a . picture, I'm going to use it.' It was a first for Mr Weber though, who has never even shot in digital before. Both failed to be enticed by the terminology and apps that dominate smartphone photography these days though. Neither was familiar with the term 'selfie', and while Mr Weber is familiar with Instagram, he is not tempted to use it himself. 'I don't know if I like the idea of sharing with a lot of people, you . know, not that I'm doing so many interesting things, but it seems weird . to me,' he says. 'I don't have . anything against it, you know, if people like what they do - others in . the studio do a lot of instagram and take beautiful pictures  - and . sometimes they take pictures of themselves - it's kind of funny, I like . to see how they see themselves.' In Vogue: Mr Bailey pictured in 1965, not long after he shot to fame, in his studio on Hanover Square . Both photographers, who have 'been mates for years and years', admitted they were . impressed by the capabilities of the 41 megapixel smartphone, which . claims to simplify the controls previously reserved for professionals.

Mr Bailey, who shot to fame in the Sixties, shooting the world's most famous models for Vogue and will be celebrated by the National Portrait Gallery next summer in a major exhibition titled Bailey's Stardust, was equally impressed. 'The level of detail you can capture using a Nokia Lumia 1020 is . nothing short of breathtaking,' he added.

Health experts are being urged to tone down the way they tell parents their children are overweight. NHS guidance to back a national weigh-in programme for schoolchildren says letters to parents should be ‘non-judgmental and positively phrased’. New template letters have been issued to local authorities ahead of the programme’s start in September, watering down the language used to describe the effects of being overweight. Health experts are being urged to tone down the way they tell parents their children are overweight, saying letters to parents should be 'non-judgmental and positively phrased' The guidance says the letter, which details height, weight and body mass index (BMI), has been ‘revised’ from last year following feedback from experts and parents. While wording can be changed to meet local needs, the guidance says it ‘is important to consider that parents receiving the letter may be sensitive to the information and feel that their parenting skills are being criticised’. ‘As such, as far as possible the letters should be non-judgmental and positively phrased.’ The National Child Measurement Programme, overseen by Public Health England, is ‘fundamental to efforts to tackle childhood obesity in England’, according to the guidance. It details how children should be weighed and measured in schools, with the results fed into national anonymous data. Letters telling parents their child is overweight or very overweight have undergone a series of changes compared to letters sent out last year. Lily James' parents, Ann and Matt James, were outraged to receive a letter which said that Lily was overweight . In the very overweight letter, parents are no longer told: ‘Your child’s result is in the very overweight range. Doctors call this clinically obese.’ While parents are told their children could face health problems in later life, the letter no longer says youngsters face ‘heart disease and some types of cancer’. In the overweight letter, two sentences have been removed which said: ‘You might be surprised your child’s result is in the overweight range. ‘It can sometimes be difficult to tell . if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children . of their age, but more children are overweight than ever before.’ Many parents expressed outrage when they received the old-style letters. For example, Ann and Matt James from Birmingham were left fuming when their trim-looking five-year-old was branded overweight. They said Lily was on the go 'non-stop' and was so small she wore clothes made for younger children. 'I was hopping mad when I read the letter,' said Mrs James. 'My friends were appalled a letter like this could be sent out.' The couple have called the verdict a 'joke' and challenged anyone looking at pictures of their daughter to say she looked unhealthy. Mr James, a house husband, added: 'There’s no way Lily is overweight. She’s very active and is on the go non-stop with her trampolining, running around and swimming. 'She will be six in November but still wears clothes for four to five-year-olds.' Lily was 3ft 5ins tall and weighed 3st 3lbs. New template letters have been issued to local authorities watering down the language used to describe the effects of being overweight . Experts use the results from the weigh-in programme to raise awareness of childhood obesity, and research suggests parents generally regard the programme in a positive way. During the 2011/12 programme, some 93 per cent of eligible children were measured throughout the school year. The results showed the proportion of children who are obese roughly doubles from 9.5 per cent of children at the start of primary school to 19.2 per cent at the end. In reception year, more than a fifth of children measured are overweight or obese, rising to one in three in Year 6. Across all years, obesity is roughly double in the most deprived areas of the country compared with the least deprived.","NHS guidance says letters to parents should be 'positively phrased'

"By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 13:30 EST, 2 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:54 EST, 2 September 2013 . Britain's militant postal union yesterday warned of ‘inevitable’ strikes as the dispute over plans to privatise Royal Mail becomes increasingly bitter. The Communication Workers Union said a strike is ‘inevitable’ unless a deal is agreed between its members and the Royal Mail. Despite the union’s upcoming ballot, the Government said it will not alter its decision to sell shares in Royal Mail in this financial year. Strike threat: The Communication Workers Union will be voting on potential industrial action this month, with its leaders saying a strike is 'inevitable' The Royal Mail said industrial action, or the possibility of disruption, was damaging to the business, especially in the run-up to Christmas, which is the busiest time for the company. The ballot will take place on this month and will see 125,000 of CWU members balloted over pay, jobs, pensions and the impact of any sell-off of the Royal Mail, with industrial action possible from October 10. The Department for Business today expressed its disappointment that the CWU are set to ballot for strike, adding that industrial action ‘isn’t necessary.’ ‘The CWU leadership are standing between their members and a generous pay offer of 8.6 per cent over three years, which is more than teachers, nurses and our armed forces, who have had pay increases capped at 1 per cent,’ a Department for Business spokesman said. Going for the vote: Dave Ward, Deputy general secretary of the CWU, says his members are at a breaking point . ‘Action taken by the CWU will not alter the Government's decision to sell shares in Royal Mail in this financial year. ‘Parliament decided over two years ago that selling shares in Royal Mail was the right thing to do to secure Royal Mail's future and protect the six-day-a-week universal postal service. ‘A successful, financially sustainable Royal Mail with access to private capital is in the best interests of the workforce and all users of the universal service.’ Dave Ward, CWU deputy general secretary, said his union members had teached a ‘breaking point’ and accused Royal Mail of ‘relishing’ in the prospect of privatisation. ‘Royal Mail continues to prepare for privatisation with relentless rounds of budget cuts in offices across the UK. 'There is no understanding that the pace of change can really only be led by how hard people can work, and CWU members are being driven to absorb absences, carry increasing amounts of mail and work harder than is possible in many cases. ‘We have reached breaking point, particularly in delivery offices, and the culture has to change.’ It will be the first national postal ballot since a pay and conditions dispute in 2009. The union said it had rejected a below-inflation pay offer linked to accepting major changes to working conditions and pensions. A number of local disputes have broken out, with the union warning that budget cuts are stretching workers ‘to the limit’ and 96 per cent of its members recently voted against privatisation. A similar percentage even said they would be prepared to boycott delivering competitors' mail. Royal Mail managers in the Unite union have also voted strongly against the planned sell-off. CWU members working in Post Offices will not be involved in the ballot, although they have been taking strike action in a separate row over closures, jobs and pay. A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘Royal Mail is very disappointed that the CWU has issued a timeline for a national ballot for industrial action, if an agreement is not reached in on-going talks. Crippling action: Royal Mail said a strike in the weeks before Christmas, its busiest time of the year, would significantly damage the company . ‘Discussions over a new three-year agreement between Royal Mail and the CWU are continuing. We are committed to reaching an agreement with the CWU as soon as possible to give our customers and employees continued stability. We believe that focusing on the possibility of industrial action is inappropriate. ‘A ballot for strike action does not mean there will be a strike; currently it is business as usual for Royal Mail. Any industrial action, or the possibility of disruption, is damaging to our customers, and our business, especially in the run up to our busiest time, Christmas. ‘Royal Mail operates in a very competitive market, especially in the parcels market. We recognise that customers have a choice and can move their business quickly. ‘Royal Mail will do all that we can to protect our business and our customers' mail. We will work hard to minimise the impact of any industrial action on our customers.’ Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Strike action would be unjustified, highly irresponsible and would hit businesses hard. It would serve only to undermine the reputation of the Royal Mail at a time when the focus should be on making the most of the privatisation process.’ All Royal Mail and Parcelforce workers in the CWU will be balloted from September 20, with the result due on October 3. If there is a yes vote, the union would have to give seven days' notice for strike action.","Communication Workers Union leader say strike is 'inevitable'

As Joanne Macfarlane recuperated from her kidney transplant, Gordon Henry did all he could to keep her cheerful. He held her hand and massaged her feet. He propped her up as she limped to the hospital toilet. He bought her new pyjamas and sneaked in her favourite chocolate. To those around them, Gordon looked like a devoted partner, well versed in the idiosyncrasies that made his relationship work. But the reality was somewhat more complicated. Gordon's role was not limited to that of self-appointed carer. He was also Joanne's kidney donor. And the two weren't lovers, but survivors of a chequered romantic history for which Gordon was desperate to make amends. Back together: Joanne and Gordon today after her once ailing health reunited them . Twenty years earlier they had fallen in love and had a child together. But Gordon, by his own admission, had not been a good boyfriend or father and they separated when their son, Jordan, was just three months old. They drifted further apart until Gordon discovered the extent of his ex-girlfriend's ailing health. Joanne was suffering from kidney failure and in urgent need of a transplant. Gordon - overcome with remorse for the way their relationship had ended - offered to help. His altruism not only saved Joanne's life, but prompted an extraordinary romantic reunion. 'Gordon risked his life for me, reminding me why I loved him,' says Joanne, 44. Gordon, 54, hopes he can atone for past mistakes: 'I was so worried about Jo and couldn't stand the thought of our son growing up without his mother.' As they were: The couple in 1994 when their son, Jordan, was born. They separated months later . Theirs is an incredible love story, as complex as it is heart-warming. The two met in Reading, in the summer of 1992 when Gordon was working in a local pub that Joanne, then 23, frequented. Their friendship blossomed into romance, with Gordon proclaiming her 'the most beautiful girl I'd ever met'. She also had a dramatic medical history. At the age of 17, after years of health complications, she was diagnosed with kidney failure. Joanne's sister, Amanda, two years her senior, had donated her kidney and the transplant operation, in 1988, was a success. Joanne, a pharmaceutical assistant manager from Sheffield, says: 'I was young and thought I was invicible'. 'Gordon asked if he could help. I said, without thinking, ""you could give me a kidney""' But she was told that the stress of her transplant would make falling pregnant impossible. So when the pair discovered she was expecting a baby in August 1993, both were stunned. Still, when their son Jordan was born in February 1994, they relished the prospect of parenthood. But they underestimated the toll it would take on their relationship. Gordon was by now a pub manager, starting work at 7.30am and finishing after midnight. Gordon, for his part, does not deny being an inadequate father. 'I wasn't prepared to prioritise family,' he admits. After three months Joanne told Gordon she'd had enough and moved out. Gordon's visits to his son dwindled, and in 1996 he moved to London to manage a different pub and fell in love with a colleague. The following year, Joanne also met a new partner. Years went by with Gordon's only contact being in the form of a child benefit cheque. Then, in early 2003, Joanne's relationship broke down, coinciding with a sudden deterioration in her health. After coughing up blood one evening in November that year, she was admitted to Reading's Royal Berkshire Hospital. Tests revealed her transplanted kidney was failing. Grown up: Gordon admitted he wasn't prepared to prioritise family in his thirties . She felt obliged to tell Gordon, but with typical stoicism she downplayed the situation. The reality was somewhat different. 'Within weeks, I had to give up work,' says Joanne. She was put on peritoneal dialysis - which meant her blood was cleaned through a tube in her stomach - for 90 minutes a day, and later that year moved, with Jordan, to Sheffield where her sister, Amanda, 46, lived. It was 2006 before her condition stabilised sufficiently for her to be put on the transplant list. But there was a shortage of donors and Joanne's prospects were bleak. The same year Gordon's nine-year relationship ended; ruined again by his workaholic tendencies. He moved back to Reading and became a courier, resuming contact with Joanne and their son, then 13, and visited them for the first time in a decade. It was a fraught meeting. 'Jordan didn't feel he needed him back and, while I no longer felt resentful, the conversation hardly flowed,' Joanne admits. Nonetheless, the couple kept in telephone contact as Joanne's health worsened. By 2007, her weakening body was a battleground of scars from constant operations and dialysis. With no new kidney, her life expectancy was estimated at just two years. 'When I was alone I would weep,' she says. Yet she didn't tell Gordon how she felt: 'I didn’t want to worry him or warrant his pity.' But in May 2009, Gordon finally broke through her controlled demeanour. 'He asked how I was and something inside me snapped,' says Joanne. 'I was tired of putting on a front and broke down. 'Gordon asked if he could help. I said, without thinking, ""you could give me a kidney."" Gordon replied ""OK, I will."" I was stunned but didn't believe he meant it.' After Gordon convinced Joanne he was serious, the couple had tests for compatibility and counselling. 'We were told I could feel forever indebted or blame Gordon if the transplant failed,' Joanne says. 'Or he might feel resentful that he'd lost a kidney for nothing.' The grim truth was that the transplant was more likely to fail than succeed; because Gordon wasn't a perfect blood match there was a 60 per cent chance Joanne's body would reject his kidney. The transplant was booked for November 30, 2009, at Sheffield Northern General Hospital - a day neither of them will ever forget. 'Gordon has not only saved my life - he has made me love living it again' 'I tried not to show my nerves,' remembers Gordon. 'There were risks for me too, but there was no way I would back out.' Joanne also struggled to control her emotions: 'I was overwhelmed with guilt, terrified something would go wrong.' Joanne and Gordon underwent a gruelling four-hour operation. When she came round, Gordon, still groggy from his own procedure, was wheeled in to see her. 'The operation was a success,' he says. 'Now I was determined to do everything I could to help her recover.' As the days passed, nobody failed to notice the intimacy between the two - except the couple themselves. 'I dismissed nurses' suggestions that Gordon still had feelings for me,' says Joanne. 'Besides, I felt so weak romance was the last thing on my mind.' After they were discharged the following week, Gordon stayed with Joanne to attend hospital appointments. 'He cooked and helped round the house,' says Joanne. 'I couldn't have coped without him.' In love again: The couple's romance is as complex as it is heart-warming . Yet it wasn't until Gordon arrived back in Reading a month after the operation that he realised his feelings extended beyond friendship. 'I called Joanne to say I was home and as I heard her voice it dawned on me that I was in love.' But he was reluctant to tell her how he felt. 'She needed to focus on recovering,' he explains. It was 18 months before they met again. By August 2011, Joanne paid Gordon a visit. 'He picked me up and gave me a huge hug, and something clicked,' she says. That evening, as they sat on Gordon's sofa, he kissed her on the lips. 'As he pulled away he murmured ""I've always loved you"",' she remembers. 'I told him I loved him too.' They knew their future belonged together. Joanne admits there has been some tension between her son, now 19 and a student, and his father. 'But he's pleased that I am happy and they're growing closer.' The couple - who split their time between Reading and Sheffield - are now deciding which city to move to together. They insist none of the issues the transplant counsellor warned them about have materialised. 'I didn't offer my kidney to get back with Jo, and she hasn't got back with me because she feels the need to repay me,' says Gordon. Joanne will be on medication for ever. But she is buoyed by Gordon's support.

A coroner has issued a stark warning after the agonising death of a two-year-old boy who mistook a bottle of plant food for his favourite Fruit Shoot drink. Aaron Booth - who had not been fed or given a drink since the previous day - suffered horrific internal burns from the toxic liquid. The pH Up plant food was being used to grow cannabis and it had been left on a windowsill next to some crisps within easy reach of the child. Aaron Booth (pictured with his father, Mohammed Khan), two, died from horrific internal burns after drinking the plant food, pH Up. He is thought to have mistaken the toxic liquid for a Fruit Shoot drink . His mother Lauren Booth, 25, has been convicted of wilful neglect over the tragedy and refused to co-operate with the inquest into her son’s death. Coroner Professor Paul Marks said he was considering a recommendation for the pH Up bottle design to be changed because it looks like the popular children’s drink. He said: ‘I am extremely concerned the packaging of plant fertiliser resembles a soft drink enjoyed by children. ‘Toxic domestic chemicals must be kept out of the reach of children at all times. ‘This accident could and should have been avoided by the appropriate storage of the chemicals.’ He added that Aaron’s death at his home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was a tragic accident that ‘could and should have been avoided’. Aaron had not been fed or given anything to drink since the day before he drank the plant food. It is thought his mother, Lauren Booth, 25, was using it to grow cannabis . Lauren Booth has been convicted of wilful neglect over the tragedy and refused to co-operate with the inquest into her son's death. She was given a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years . Huddersfield Coroner’s Court heard how the youngster drank the plant food - a mixture of potassium hydroxide and water - after it was left on a window ledge outside his bedroom. His mother was still in bed at 12.45pm with her partner Sean Williams when she heard a thud and got up to find her son struggling for breath with blue froth coming from his mouth. Aaron, who had drank around 10ml of the liquid, was rushed to hospital and transferred to intensive care but died 11 days later in November 2010. At the inquest into Aaron's death, the coroner said it was a tragic accident that 'could and should have been avoided'. The plant food was left on a window ledge where Aaron could reach it and was next to a bag of crisps . Aaron, who had drank around 10ml of the liquid, was rushed to hospital and transferred to intensive care but died 11 days later in November 2010 . The powerful chemical wreaked extensive damage to his body, burning - among other things - his oral cavity, trachea, oesophagus, spleen and stomach. Detective Sergeant Jane Taylor said Ms Booth and her partner told her that Aaron liked to drink Fruit Shoots. She added there was some indication that cannabis cultivation was going on in the house. The inquest heard that Aaron and his mother were known to several agencies as he was born prematurely and had both hearing and learning problems. Coroner Professor Paul Marks said he was . considering a recommendation for the pH Up bottle (left) design to be changed . because it looks like the popular children’s drink, Fruit Shoot (right) Kirklees Safeguarding Children Board carried out a serious case review into the death. It found that social workers should have stepped in sooner when it was clear Ms Booth was struggling around six months before Aaron’s death. But the review concluded that Aaron’s death ‘could not have been anticipated or prevented’. Ms Booth was convicted of neglect in May 2012 and left court grinning as she was given a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years. The inquest heard that Aaron and his mother were known to several agencies as he was born prematurely and had both hearing and learning problems. The picture shows Aaron's home in Huddersfield . The trial heard how Aaron hadn’t been fed since the day before and was ‘hungry and thirsty’ when he got hold of the bottle while searching for something to drink. Trial Judge Colin Burn told Ms Booth: ‘It was a cataclysmic, single failure to act. ‘Aaron was almost three, at an age where he was curious and everything was a challenge, therefore by failing to supervise him you allowed this terrible event to happen. ‘I’m bound to say that Aaron’s death was a prolonged and frankly horrible one. ‘There is no other way to describe it. And it was preventable.’ The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death contributed to by neglect.","Aaron Booth, two, suffered horrific internal burns after drinking pH Up .

Furious: Michael Gove, pictured entering Number 10 today, stepped up his criticism of Labour MPs in the wake of last week's Syria vote . Michael Gove today accused Labour MPs of behaving like fans at a ‘football match’ cheering at the result of the Commons vote against military action in Syria. The Education Secretary condemned the Ed Miliband’s party for ‘celebrating’ at a time when ‘children had been killed by a ruthless dictator’. But the bitter recriminations of the vote continued, with Labour claiming Mr Gove’s comments were ‘puerile, stupid and grossly offensive’. The unexpected defeat by just 13 votes on Thursday night was the first time since 1782 that a government had lost a vote on war and peace. In the corridors of Parliament afterwards Mr Gove, a staunch backer of military action in Syria, shouted 'you're a disgrace' at those MPs who opposed the Government in the tense vote. Today the Cabinet Minister admitted he had become ‘heated’ but stepped up his criticism of the behaviour of Labour MPs. There were cheers and shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked House of Commons. Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ‘I did become heated last week, that is absolutely right. ‘At the moment that the Government lost the vote on the motion, there were Labour MPs cheering as though it were a sort of football match and they had just won. ‘At the same time on the news, we were hearing about an attack on a school in Syria and the death toll there rising. ‘And the incongruity of Labour MPs celebrating as children had been killed by a ruthless dictator, I am afraid got to me and I did feel incredibly emotional. I do feel emotional about this subject.’ The remarks lay bare the depth of anger in the government at the way Labour approached the vote. But Labour Party vice-chairman Michael Dugher said Mr Gove’s comments were ‘grossly offensive’. ‘Michael Gove's comments today are puerile, stupid & grossly offensive,’ the MP wrote on Twitter. ‘A desperate, low and partisan attack that demeans his office.’ Right behind you: Mr Gove, pictured in Downing Street with David Cameron today, insisted the Prime Minister had been right to rule out military action after the vote . Some 30 Tory rebels as well as nine Liberal Democrats joined with Labour to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Prime Minister. A Government source branded Mr Miliband a ‘f****** c***’ and a . ‘copper-bottomed s***’ for demanding concessions from Mr Cameron and . then voting against the watered down government motion. Immediately after the vote the Prime Minister ruled out any British involvement in military action against Syria. But in the days since there have been growing calls for a second Commons vote. In the Commons today Foreign Secretary William Hague again insisted the government had no plans to return to Parliament on the issue. But he stressed that Mr Cameron will pursue every possible option for Syria when he visits the G20 summit in Russia. Mr Hague said the conflict in Syria would dominate the bi-lateral meetings between countries but it was up to the Russian government to set the agenda for multi-lateral talks, which will take place at the summit in St Petersburg on Thursday and Friday. Speaking during Foreign Office questions in the House of Commons, Mr Hague also condemned the Syrian regime for preventing vital humanitarian aid from reaching Syrian refugees. Recall: There were calls of 'resign' from the Labour benches before David Cameron told the Commons that Britain would play no part in military action against Syria . Labour’s shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy called on ministers to ‘spell out in what, if any, circumstances changes in Syria or internationally the Government would bring back to Parliament the issue of UK military involvement in Syria?’ But Defence Secretary Mr Hammond said: ‘It's a bit rich for you (Mr Murphy), who last week trooped into the lobbies behind your leader, giving rise to the very situation we now find ourselves in, to demand I tell you precisely in which circumstances we might revisit this issue. ‘I've said already we believe Parliament has spoken clearly on this issue and is unlikely to want to revisit it unless the circumstances change very significantly.’ Mr Obama today said he was confident that Congress would back his plan for intervention in Syria. But he said he was ready to change the language of the motion to ensure it attracted widespread support. The President said: 'So long as we . are accomplishing what needs to be accomplished, which is to send a . clear message to Assad, to degrade his capabilities to use chemical . weapons, not just now but also in the future, as long as the . authorization allows us to do that, I'm confident that we're going to be . able to come up with something that hits that mark.' And Mr Obama insisted: 'This is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan.' Meanwhile, French president Francoise Hollande said he would to wait for the US Congress decision on military action in Syria before deciding on any action France might take.","Education Secretary condemns 'celebrating' vote against military action .

A teenager has lost a whopping seven stone after discovering she was too plump to fit into her prom dress. At 17st, Amy Pratt, now 20, was unable to fit into her size 24 frock, the biggest dress available. Distraught, she decided to join WeightWatchers in a bid to shed a stone and squeeze into her gown in time for the prom. Four years on, 5ft 7in Amy is now a slimline 10st and will appear on the cover of WeightWatchers' glossy magazine. Amy Pratt, 20, lost more than 7st after being unable to fit into a size 24 prom dress . Amy, from Tameside in Greater Manchester, joined WeightWatchers in 2009 as a last resort after years of feeling uncomfortable in her own skin. The teenager had fallen into a vicious circle of comfort eating and faddy dieting in a bid to quell feelings of self-doubt and as a result weighed more than 17st at the age of 16. 'It was hard going to that first class, especially as I hadn’t weighed myself in a very, very long time,' revealed Amy. 'But after I stood on the scales, uncomfortable though it was, I felt relieved. The prom was eight weeks away and I just wanted to fit into that dress.' By the time prom day arrived, the dress was too big. 'I lost half a stone in the first week,' she adds. 'That was such a big incentive. 'Seeing the changes in my body motivated me to continue after the prom. It wasn’t always easy. There are times when you feel fed up after trying really hard and you only lose 1lb in a week. It’s the small changes that make a big difference and focusing on portion size.' Amy piled on the pounds after falling into a vicious cycle of overeating and faddy diets . Amy then went on to lose more than seven stone gradually over two years and looks every inch the model as she graces the cover of WeightWatchers magazine. During the photoshoot in London, Amy was also given the chance to meet the slimming organisation's ambassador, actress Patsy Kensit. Amy, who works in business administration at the Co-operative Group’s head office in Manchester, said: 'I didn’t have much confidence before and I’m sure losing weight contributed to me getting my job. 'I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. I enjoy my job and I’ve got a boyfriend. Life’s great.' Amy’s WeightWatchers leader Eleanor Murdoch added: 'Amy has shown a quiet and steady determination to reach her goal even when faced with the ups and downs that life throws at you. 'She has grown into a confident and beautiful young woman who is an inspiration to myself, her fellow members and her work colleagues, friends and family.'","Amy Pratt, 20, an administrator from Manchester, tipped the scales at 17st .

An online campaign to expose Nigel Farage’s ‘less pleasant and stranger utterances’ is needed to tackle the threat UKIP poses to the Tories, Andy Coulson has warned. The former Number 10 spin chief sounds the alarm about Tory ‘vulnerability’ to UKIP and warns his old boss David Cameron that more needs to be done to woo voters who have flocked to Mr Farage. UKIP has become a club of ‘disgruntled’ ex-Tories who are ‘fed up’ with Mr Cameron’s leadership, Mr Coulson claims. Vulnerable: Andy Coulson (left), former government director of communications, urges the Tories to take the fight to UKIP's Nigel Farage who is expected to win the European Parliament elections next year . Setting out a blueprint for seeing off the threat posed by Mr Farage’s anti-EU party, Mr Coulson calls for a video compilation of the UKIP leader to be posted online. A £120billion blackhole in UKIP’s spending plans should also be exposed to more scrutiny. But Mr Coulson warns in an article in GQ magazine that with UKIP expected to win next year’s European Parliament elections, Mr Farage will have a right to demand a place on TV leaders’ debates ahead of the general election. It is the latest intervention from Mr Coulson, who quit as Downing Street director of communications in January 2011. He is now facing trial over allegations related to conspiracy to hack phones and conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. Branding the UKIP leader ‘Mr Mirage’, Mr Coulson urges the Tories to compile a blooper reel of Mr Farage’s ‘less pleasant and stranger utterances’ which could be posted on YouTube. The misdemeanours of UKIP MEPs in Brussels should also become front page news if the Tories are to reverse the perception that Mr Farage’s leads an anti-politics party. Appeal: Mr Farage has managed to attracted 'disgruntled' Tories fed up with David Cameron's leadership, Mr Coulson claims . Tory analysis suggests there is a £120billion blackhole in UKIP’s policies which ‘must be hung around [Mr Farage’s] neck’. However, the former editor of the News of the World  warns against a repeat of Mr Cameron’s 2006 claim that UKIP members as ‘a bunch of fruit cakes and loonies and closet racists’. The slur was repeated in the days before the local elections this year, when Tory minister Ken Clarke said he had ‘met people who satisfy both those descriptions in UKIP’. After a furious backlash, UKIP went on to take one in four votes in elections to councils across England. Mr Coulson says the Conservative strategy to tackle UKIP has been ‘misplaced for years’ with the Tory leadership being ‘dismissive, arrogant and downright rude’. Mr Coulson adds: ‘As a result UKIP has become a club for disgruntled, invariably older Tories fed up with the leadership’s attitude mostly, although not entirely, towards Europe. ‘More dangerously it allowed the party to present itself as the natural home for anyone fed up with mainstream politics.’ Increasing pressure on the Tories, Mr Farage has threatened to go to court to secure a place on TV leaders’ debates before the general election. Mr Coulson says the UKIP leader may have a ‘bit of a point’. He argues: ‘The Conservatives should meet the UKIP debating challenge sooner and have Farage boxed off long before the first TV debate. ‘It should be led by a senior Cabinet member, not the PM . ... Hague, as Foreign Secretary, is perfectly placed for some net practice on Farage’s preferred playing surface of Europe.’ Battle: Mr Coulson argues the UKIP leader will have a claim to taking party in 2015 general election TV debates, if his party tops the polls in May next year . Mr Coulson adds: ‘Europe will, of course, continue to be the drum that UKIP bangs the loudest. ‘The Conservatives’ post election in/out referendum promise took the wind out of UKIP sails but more work will need to be done as next year’s European elections approach. ‘On that issue, I’m in no doubt, William Hague is already burning the midnight oil.’","Coulson ridicules UKIP leader as 'Mr Mirage' who is 'inauthentic'

Harley McLean was born to Rachel Hales after she experienced the trauma of losing two premature babies and having four miscarriages. But even his pregnancy did not run smoothly and Harley was born two months early and put on life support. He also contracted several infections. Rachel Hales, 25, had Harley McLean, now eight-months-old, after losing two premature babies and suffering four miscarriages. Harley was born two months prematurely and spent three months in hospital . But, after three months at Tameside Hospital, in Ashton Under Lyne, Lancashire, Harley recovered and now, at eight-months, is thriving. Ms Hales and her partner Andrew McLean, both 25 and from Ashton, have called their son a ‘little miracle’. They also hailed his consultant ‘their guardian angel’. Ms Hales, who already had a seven-year-old son, Leighton, had a difficult pregnancy leading to fears she could miscarry again at any time. She was rushed into Tameside Hospital after collapsing on the bathroom floor and going into labour at just 28 weeks. She said: ‘It was like something from a horror film. My little boy was crying and saying his brother and mum were going to die.’ Harley (pictured shortly after his birth) had to be delivered by C-section when Ms Hales went into labour and suffered a haemorrhage. He had to be placed on a life support machine . Ms Hales had haemorrhaged and baby Harley was delivered by emergency Caesarean section, before being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Ms Hales said: ‘Harley is our little miracle and my consultant Dr Beth Hammersley is our guardian angel. ‘I put all the faith I had in Beth because there was nothing else I could do. ‘I would walk over hot coals for her. I truly believe if it wasn’t for her and her actions that we wouldn’t be here now.’ Ms Hales’ pregnancy with her second son, Dylan, turned to tragedy when he was born at 26 weeks. She had to make the heartbreaking decision, with her then partner, to turn off his life support after eight days. Ms Hales, and her partner Andrew McLean, have described Harley as a 'miracle baby' and say that his consultant, Dr Beth Hammersley, at Tameside Hospital, is their 'guardian angel' She then became pregnant with little girl, Kacey, who was born at 22 weeks but lived for just four hours. She then went on to have four miscarriages. When Ms Hales became pregnant again last year she felt ill immediately. She suffered repeated problems and feared the worst when she went into labour early again. She said: ‘I feel so lucky to have him - he’s our golden boy. ‘The care we have received from Tameside Hospital, all the medical team, the midwives and everyone in the unit has been amazing.’ Dr Hammersley added: ‘I met Rachel and Andrew for the first time in this pregnancy and we have been through something of a rollercoaster ride together.’","Rachel Hales gave birth to Harley, now eight-months, two months early .

When it comes to running, women may get more out of high intensity interval training than their male counterparts . Many gym goers have learnt to dread interval training but new research suggests that it may be the best way for women to get maximum benefits from exercise. The research shows that when it comes to running, women may get more out of high intensity interval training than their male counterparts. Earlier interval training studies primarily focused on highly trained males, but researchers say that they overlooked the variety of other populations that routinely use interval training. Drs Matt Laurent and Matt Kutz, at Bowling Green State University, Lauren Vervaecke, at the University of South Carolina, and Dr Matt Green at the University of North Alabama, put eight men and eight women between the ages of 19 and 30 through self-paced, high intensity interval training using different recovery periods. All of them reported at least a moderate fitness level and participation in at least one session of interval training a week. Participants used a treadmill for six, four-minute intervals performed at the highest intensity they felt they could maintain. Recovery periods between intervals consisted of one minute, two minute or four minute breaks. Throughout the intervals, the participants’ maximum oxygen consumption and heart rates were measured. Results revealed a significant effect of gender on both percentages. Across the trials, men self-selected a faster relative pace, but the women worked at a higher percentage of their maximum heart rate than the men, and a higher percentage of their maximum oxygen consumption. ‘I think what our data show is that there appear to be meaningful differences in how men and women self-regulate their workouts,’ Dr Laurent said. ‘Specifically, in our case, men and women tend to work at the same level of perceived exertion and feel similarly recovered between each interval, however, as they perform the interval runs women tended to work “harder” from a relative cardiovascular standpoint than men.’ Results also confirmed previous findings suggesting that a 2:1 work-to-rest ratio is optimal during HIIT for both men and women. The results also confirmed previous findings suggesting that a 2:1 work-to-rest ratio is optimal during high intensity interval training for both men and women . ‘I really think one of the “take home” points from our study was, despite the gender differences that we found, individuals performing high-intensity interval training should listen to, and trust, their body and pay attention to how they are feeling,’ said Dr Laurent. ‘Without having any feedback about their data, all the participants had to use to set their pace was how they felt during the run and how recovered they felt. ‘In that sense, when runners perform high-intensity intervals, trust that if you push yourself to run what you consider hard, you are probably at the correct intensity, and if you maintain recommended work-to-rest ratios you most likely will recover appropriately to get the most out of your workout, independent of gender.’","Interval training may be the best way for women to benefit from running .

Last week, personal trainer to the stars, Louise Parker, shared the first part of her fat fighting secrets in a new blog which . she promises will help people shape up in just a fortnight. The 'figure magic 14' plan is one she's devised to work for her high profile clients - who include royalty to rock stars. Now she's giving mere mortals an insight into how to can achieve her toned results by posting daily lifestyle tips, meal plans and workouts on her website. Last Monday, the MailOnline featured the first day of the plan, and below you can see the details for days eight and nine. The remaining days of the plan can be accessed via Louise's blog. For those who have been following the diet and exercise tips, how can they stick with it now they're half way through the 14-day regime? Louise, 38, a mother-of-three recommends making a specific list of why you wanted to do the 'figure magic 14' in the first place. She said: 'Is it to kickstart you into a healthier lifestyle? Is it to drop some body fat to spur you on? Is it to overhaul your eating habits positively? Is it to improve your fitness? 'Write down your reasons and and commit to them.' She also said those struggling should remember it's only two weeks - and if you started last Monday, you're already half way there. She said: 'Make a clear decision to commit fully to the remainder of the programme. You can do anything for two weeks. Remind yourself that it's a temporary situation and you can introduce some treats once you've hit some goals.' But instead of indulging in fattening treats that may undo your efforts to tone up and lose weight, the London-based trainer recommends instead rewarding yourself with pampering treats instead. She said: 'Book a massage, manicure or blow dry – anything to put a spring in your step without sabotaging your progress.' Louise explained of her programme that the aim of it is to 'energise you, cleanse you, . nourish you and rid your body of as much body fat as one can sensibly do . on any diet and fitness plan. If you stick to the programme for . 14 days, you will achieve results that you and others will notice.' After the fortnight, she said people should stick to the principles as much as they can and remember that transforming lifestyle habits will take more time. She said: 'Remember that this is a kick start – a true body transformation takes time, commitment and consistency so as you do the programme, commit to the aspects you can continue with forever. She added: 'Keep a diet diary and note of the workouts completed so you have something to refer to once you've completed the 14-days and you can repeat it any time you need another fat burning boost.' Celebrity trainer: Louise counts rock stars and royalty as her clients and is now revealing some of the secrets she shares with them on her blog . DAY EIGHT . Louise's lifestyle tip of the day: Staying beautifully hydrated is essential on this plan. You should be . starting your day with a pint of warm water, mixed with juice of ½ . lemon, before your morning caffeine fix (I allow 2 x per day). Aim for a . minimum of 2 litres of water per day and 1.5 litres of this should be . your cranberry water (1.5 litres mixed with 30ml of cranberry . concentrate liquid). You should be taking 2 x Psyllium Husk capsules . before each meal, for added fibre. Don't take it with medication as it . could absorb it. This all works together to improve lymphatic drainage . and fat elimination from the body. Waterlogged tissues will . dramatically improve – goodbye cankles and hello Jimmy Choo. MEAL PLANNER . Breakfast: Vitality Smoothie. Blend together 150g of Total 0% Greek Yoghurt with ½ . frozen banana, handful of frozen summer berries, handful of . blueberries, 1 tbsp of oats and 100 – 200ml of water . Morning snack: One Braeburn apple and 12 almonds . Lunch: Sweet Lentil Salad. ¼  cup of ready cooked Merchant . Gourmet Puy Lentils, ¼ cup of cannellini beans, 6 cherry tomatoes, 2 . spring onions, ½ red pepper, ½ yellow pepper.  Season with 1tbsp good . balsamic vinegar, ½ tbsp. olive oil, salt and pepper . Afternoon snack: 2 sticks of celery filled with peanut butter . Supper:  Salmon parcel with spring vegetables (cook double for tomorrow's lunch box)Wrap . 100g salmon fillet in foil parcel, adding 1 tbsp peas, handful spinach, . 2 baby courgette, handful of mange tout.  Add 2 tbsp white wine or . vegetable stock, salt and pepper.  Bake until tender. Drinks: Morning: Juice of ½ lemon mixed with ½ pint of boiling water, ½ pint of cold. Drink before any other teas or coffees. You may have a total of two coffees or teas per day, made with no more than 100ml of semi skimmed milk. No fruit juices or cordials and you must drink no less than 2 litres of water per day. If you are not a fan of water, add some chopped cucumber for a refreshing drink. Mid morning and mid afternoon: Add one tsp of cranberry powder to ½ litre of water and drink. This can be part of your two litres of water per day. Listen to your thirst and drink as much water as your body tells you. EXERCISE: Interval session . These reps can be done walking, jogging, running or sprinting depending on how fit you . are. They are also be done on a bike, in a swimming pool or at the gym. The aim is to carry out the different levels of intensity for the amount of time shown (where level zero is doing nothing and level 10 is your maximum, pushing yourself as hard as you can. For this to really be effective, you have to challenge yourself out of . your comfort zone for a very short period of time. These painful . minutes will result in a really positive uplift in your metabolism for . up to 24 hours after the session has finished. Minute 1/2/3 - Level 5/10 . Minute 4 - Level 6/10 .

Minute 19 - 20 - Take your heart rate down . Minute 20 - 30 - Level 6/10 work at a steady pace for 10 minutes and then have a stretch . DAY NINE . Louise's lifestyle tip of the day: Aim to get your workouts in before breakfast if your . primary goal is fat loss. When your glycogen levels . (energy storage in your muscles) is low, your body has no choice but to . dip into fat reserves to fuel your workout. The beauty of this plan is that it is low GI and low in sugars so your body should remain . in a fat burning state most of the day. If we've just days or weeks to . prepare a celebrity for an event, we train them hard before breakfast – . and then maybe again in the evening. MEAL PLANNER .

Ollie Petherick, two, from Devizes, Wiltshire, was born with Angelman syndrome - a chromosome disorder which causes severe learning difficulties – and puts a permanent smile on his face. Sufferers present a happy demeanour, so are often smiling or laughing, and tend to be easily excited. Ollie Petherick (pictured with his mother, Annie Campbell) has Angelman syndrome - a rare genetic condition that means he has severe learning disabilities but that he is also always smiling . The condition is so rare that less than 1,000 cases have been reported in the UK. Ollie’s mother, Annie Campbell, said: ‘Ollie’s smile and happy personality just makes everything worthwhile. ‘I can be seriously sleep deprived but his smile never fails to cheer me up - he has a knack of really making you feel his excitement and his giggle is just amazing. ‘The only thing any parent wants is for their child to be happy, and I know that with Ollie, I will always have that.’ Ms Campbell, 24, often receives compliments about her little boy’s beaming smile. She said: ‘We get a lot of comments about his smile when we’re out which his lovely - it really does make you happy when you see his grin. Ollie (pictured with his mother, Annie Campbell, and father, Iain) was diagnosed with Angelman syndrome after his mother noticed that he was not able to focus properly. There are only 1,000 known cases in the UK . Ms Campbell, said: 'Ollie's smile and happy personality just makes everything worthwhile. I can be seriously sleep deprived but his smile never fails to cheer me up.' Ollie is pictured as a baby . ‘He was a very relaxed and placid baby too - he’d always babble away to himself without a care in the world.’ Ms Campbell, who is now a full time carer for her son, only discovered Ollie’s condition when she noticed he couldn’t focus on things properly. She said: ‘Ollie was six-months-old when I started to notice that his development was delayed - his older brother was much more advanced at his age. ‘Then, one evening, I spent hours trying to get him to follow my finger with his eyes, and he just couldn’t do it. ‘I really started to worry, so the next morning I went to the GP to be on the safe side. Ollie's mother, Ms Campbell, says that people often comment on how lovely Ollie's smile is. She said: 'It really does make you happy when you see his grin' Ms Campbell says that she knew Ollie had Angelman syndrome before he was officially diagnosed as she had read about the condition and all of his symptoms matched those she read about . ‘We were referred to the hospital where they did eye tests, but we were eventually told that Ollie suffered from something neurological, but they weren’t quite sure what.’ Ms Campbell was then transferred to a second hospital where her little boy underwent more tests. Meanwhile, she had come across Angelman syndrome in a magazine, and was convinced it was what her son suffered from. She said: ‘I’d read an article in the magazine and the symptoms they were described were exactly the same as Ollie’s. Ms Campbell said: 'It was a relief to finally get a diagnosis. I just wanted to learn as much as I could about it so I knew how to help Ollie' ‘I rang his dad straight away and told him that Ollie had Angelman - I was certain of it. ‘I just knew that’s what he had, and then two days later - six weeks after our first appointment - it was confirmed by the doctors. ‘By this point, I’d already convinced myself he had Angelman, so it was a relief to finally get a diagnosis. I just wanted to learn as much as I could about it so I knew how to help Ollie. ‘I went online and tried to find out as much as possible. I read that Angelman was to do with a deletion of a chromosome – it’s funny how such a tiny thing like that can affect someone so much. Ms Campbell says that she worries about Ollie's future as he will not be able to walk or talk easily. However, she says that for now she just enjoys him as he is . ‘I found support groups and other mum’s who had children with Angelman too, that’s how I got the most help and information.’ Ms Campbell added: ‘Ollie won’t be able to speak or walk with ease when he grows up which is upsetting. ‘I do worry about him in the future - I wonder how I’ll know if he is ever upset or sad, when the Angelman makes him so happy all the time. ‘But at the moment I just enjoy the lovely little boy that I have.’ Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic condition first identified in 1965 by a British doctor, Harry Angelman. Dr Angelman had noticed similarities between a small number of previously undiagnosed children that seemed to indicate they had a common problem. After seeing a painting in the Castelvecchio museum in Verona, Italy, entitled A Boy with a Puppet, he was inspired to write a medical paper titled Puppet Children. The syndrome - originally called 'Happy Puppet Syndrome' because of the characteristic happy demeanour and stiff jerky movements of the children - was renamed Angelman syndrome in 1982. Although at first little was known and indeed few other cases identified, in recent years much more has been learned. During the 1980s advances in genetic medicine made it possible to diagnose increasing numbers of cases and also to start identifying the cause. Most AS children are diagnosed between the ages of three and seven when the characteristic physical and behavioural features become evident.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 05:47 EST, 4 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:55 EST, 4 September 2013 . A father-of-two has been suffering from hiccups for the last 14 months. Daniel Clavin, 37, woke up with a hangover and hiccups in July last year – and he is still hiccupping. He hiccups every seven seconds meaning that he has hiccupped an estimated 5.25 million times. Daniel Clavin (pictured with his wife, Susan, and his children, Harry and Megan) has been hiccuping every seven seconds for the last 14 months. He has undergone numerous tests but none have offered a solution . The problem is so bad, that they sometimes cause him to pass out and keep him awake for hours at night. He also spends many nights in the spare room so his long-suffering wife, Susan, can get some sleep. Mr Clavin has seen a number of experts, had two endoscopies, a CT scan, changed his diet, taken tranquilisers and consulted a chiropractor - all in vain. The software worker with British Telecom is now waiting for an MRI scan fearing that the hiccups may be an indication of a serious medical problem. He said: ‘They’ve taken over my life. I woke up with them one morning after a stag do and I’ve had them ever since. ‘I’ve no idea why they started - I’d had more to drink than I had for some time but it was nothing out of the ordinary, just the usual mix of beer and spirits. Mr Clavins (pictured with his wife, Susan) has hiccupped an estimated 5.25 million times since the problem began in July last year. He has to sleep in the spare room so he doesn't disturb his wife . ‘Some days are worse than others and on odd days they’ll stop, but they can get so bad I pass out or throw up my food. ‘There are times when I can’t breathe for 30 seconds because they lock up my diaphragm. ‘Nights are bad and sometimes I wake up and the whole bed is shaking because they are so violent and I’ll go to sleep in a different room so Susan can get some rest. ‘I’ve learned to control them to some extent and disguise them and hiccup quietly but when I stop thinking about them they start sounding again. ‘People find it quite funny when they first meet me but then it becomes quite annoying for someone to have to listen to.’ Mr Clavins says he has tried all the tricks he has come across to stop his hiccups - including eating sugar and vinegar (pictured). He says a chiropractor gave him some relief but that the hiccups soon returned . Mr Clavin, father to Harry, three, and 10 month-old Megan, says he has been able to continue working as he is deskbound and has little contact with people outside his office. He said: ‘I’ve tried all the old wives’ tales like eating sugar and vinegar and all manner of supposed cures, but nothing’s worked. ‘Last month I had some relief after seeing a chiropractor who manipulated the phrenic nerve in my neck which is connected to the diaphragm. Mr Clavins said: 'I've to try to keep cheerful but I'm at the stage now where I'm scraping the barrel for ideas and looking for people to help me.' He is pictured trying to stop the hiccups by breathing into a paper bag . ‘They stopped for ten days and I thought I’d finally got rid of them - but then they started again and are as bad as ever. ‘I’ve to try to keep cheerful but I’m at the stage now where I’m scraping the barrel for ideas and looking for people to help me. ‘The medical community doesn’t seem to know what to do, but it is quite rare. ‘I’m told there’s only a handful of people in the world at this moment who will have hiccups as bad.’ Mr Clavin decided to have an MRI scan after reading of Chris Sands, 29, from Lincolnshire, who had hiccups for nearly three years before a scan in 2008 detected a brain tumour. Mr Clavin, from County Roscommon, Ireland, said: ‘Obviously that’s a worst-case scenario but I need to have one done at least to eliminate it.’ Mrs Clavin, 38, said: ‘He’s in a bad way and they are getting him down. ‘He’s constantly losing his breath and it’s difficult for anyone to concentrate on anything else when he’s around. ‘They can wake me up in the night and I then lie there waiting for the next one and I have to send him out of the room.’ She added: ‘He’s had blood tests and tried different diets, thinking they might be related to gluten but nothing’s worked. ‘We seem to have exhausted the stomach route and are now looking at nerves as being a possible cause. ‘He’s seen a chiropractor who thought it could be related to his posture and he had 12 days’ relief but they came back again really bad out of the blue. ‘We are just desperate to find someone who can help him because the hiccups are ruining our lives.’ Hiccups occur when the diaphragm - a thin membrane of muscles separating the chest from the abdomen - suddenly and involuntarily contracts. As the diaphragm contracts, it causes a person to breathe in air very quickly. This air is stopped when the vocal cords close suddenly  - this produces the characteristic sound of a hiccup. They are very common and are usually short-lived. Short-term hiccups can be caused by consuming alcohol, excessive smoking, a bloated stomach, a sudden change in temperature, shock and excitement. Occasionally, and usually in men, hiccups can be longer-lived. These hiccups can be caused by gastrointestinal conditions, respiratory conditions, problems of the central nervous system or psychological conditions. They can also be caused by a reaction to medications including anaesthetics, sedatives and anti-seizure medication. Prolonged hiccups can cause insomnia, weight loss, exhaustion and depression. Treatment for long-lived hiccups usually involves establishing and treating the underlying cause. However, in some cases, medication can help.

Patients who received the most potent forms of the cholesterol-lowering drug were up to three times less likely to suffer from the disease, scientists discovered. The findings seem to back up earlier studies that claimed a widely prescribed statin may combat Alzheimer’s by improving the function of blood vessels. Patients who received the most potent forms of the cholesterol-lowering drug were up to three times less likely to suffer from the disease, scientists discovered . The latest research examined nearly 58,000 patients in Taiwan to discover if use of the drug was associated with new diagnoses of dementia. Dr Tin-Tse Lin, who presented the findings at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Amsterdam said risks were reduced with increased total or daily dosages of the drug. ‘Patients who received the highest total equivalent doses of statins had a three-fold decrease in the risk of developing dementia,’ it was found. ‘Similar results were found with the daily equivalent statin dosage.’ Researchers found that the dosage rather than solubility of potent drugs such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were responsible for their effectiveness. Almost every available version of the drug, except lovastatin, decreased the risk for new onset dementia when taken at higher daily doses. ‘Higher doses of high potency statins gave the strongest protective effects against dementia,’ said Dr Tin-Tse Lin. High doses of statins may prevent dementia in old age, according to research . ‘A high mean daily dosage of lovastatin was positively associated with the development of dementia, possibly because lovastatin is a lipophilic statin while the anti-inflammatory cholesterol lowering effect of lovastatin is not comparable to that of atorvastatin and simvastatin.’ An earlier study found that a widely prescribed statin may prevent some of the symptoms of Alzheimer’s by improving blood vessel function. The research, carried out on mice by researchers at McGill University in Montreal, also found the drug boosted learning and memory in younger sufferers when the disease had not progressed far.However, treatment using simvastatin had no effect on one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s – a build-up of a particular protein in the brain, even in those who otherwise benefited. About 1million prescriptions for the cholesterol-lowering drugs are written in England each week, and statins have become a mainstay for doctors treating the survivors of heart attacks and strokes. They make up the vast majority of lipid-lowering drugs and are effective at lowering levels of cholesterol, the fatty substance in blood that clogs up arteries and leads to heart attacks. So far there has been no clear evidence that statins help reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer’s. In fact, memory loss is a known side-effects of the drug.","The latest research examined nearly 58,000 patients in Taiwan .

A father has told how he saved his newborn baby’s life when he was born suddenly at home with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck. Ashley Edwards, 35, was forced to deliver his son, Toby, when his wife, Kimberly, 30, realised the baby would not wait until they got to hospital. However, when Toby was born, Mr Edwards was shocked to realise that he was not breathing. Ashley Edwards delivered baby Toby when his wife, Kimberly, suddenly went into labour at home. She was only 35 weeks pregnant and Toby was born within an hour of contractions starting . He told the 999 call handler, Megan Llewellyn at East of England Ambulance Service, who talked him through the birth, and she explained how to remove the cord from the baby’s neck to allow him to breathe. Mr Edwards, from Dereham, Norfolk, said: ‘I really started to panic when I realised my baby wasn’t crying. ‘Thankfully Megan was brilliant. She calmly talked me through what to do. ‘She told me to slide a finger under the cord gently pull it away from the neck and over the head.’ Mrs Edwards was 35 weeks pregnant when, on July 20, she started to feel contractions. Toby was not breathing when he was born because the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck. A 999 call handler explained to Mr Edwards how to remove it so that the baby could breathe . Toby (pictured with his sister, Sophie) started breathing as soon as Mr Edwards removed the umbilical cord from around his neck. He and his mother were taken to hospital by paramedics shortly after his birth . She called her local hospital but was told that they were probably Braxton Hicks contractions – practice contractions. However, this was not the case, and within an hour it was clear that baby Toby was on his way. Mr Edwards called 999 at 11.41am and answered a series of questions from Ms Llewellyn. The answers informed the call handler that the baby would be delivered imminently. Mr Llewellyn said: ‘I encouraged him to apply firm but gentle pressure to stop the baby delivering too quickly and advised him to support the shoulders and hips of the baby. Mr Edward's 999 call was answered by Megan Llewellyn (pictured with Toby and Mr and Mrs Edwards). She talked Mr Edwards through the birth and told him how to remove the cord from around Toby's neck . Ms Llewellyn said: 'I remember letting out a deep breath when I heard Toby cry for the first time, I didn't even realise I'd been holding it' ‘He was incredibly calm and was really listening to my instructions. Within five minutes of the 999 call being made, the baby had been delivered.’ However, Mr Edwards immediately realised that there was something wrong with the baby as he was not crying. He could see that the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck and that he was not breathing. However, to his relief, when he removed the cord, Toby started breathing and began to cry. Toby (pictured shortly after his birth) is now a happy, healthy baby despite his traumatic birth . Mr Edwards said: ‘I don’t think I realised up until then how much I’d been panicking. ‘I don’t know what would have happened had we not rang 999. Megan’s reassuring voice calmed me and got me through it all.’ Ms Llewellyn remained on the phone until an ambulance arrived to take the trio to hospital. Mr Edwards said: ‘I went from the pure elation of seeing my son being born, to absolute fear when I realised he wasn’t breathing. ‘It was the scariest moment of my life but Megan was able to talk me through what to do and thankfully he started breathing. ‘I have never been as relieved as I was when I heard him start to cry and I can’t thank Megan enough.’ Mrs Edwards said: ‘I suddenly started experiencing a lot of pain on the Saturday and it quickly became apparent that the contractions were so close together that I couldn’t move anywhere. ‘My husband rang 999 and within five minutes, Toby had been born. ‘I’m so grateful to Megan for guiding Ashley through the delivery, and I’m really proud of my husband for not panicking.’ She added: ‘It must be scary enough to have to deliver a baby, but to then realise he wasn’t breathing was terrifying. ‘Thanks to Megan’s calm instructions, though, Toby was soon breathing and crying – he’s certainly got a healthy set of lungs on him. ‘We’ll never forget his dramatic birth and we’ll always be grateful to Megan and everyone involved at the ambulance service.’ Mr Edwards said: 'I really started to panic when I realised my baby wasn't crying. Thankfully Megan was brilliant. She calmly talked me through what to do.' Toby is pictured with his brother, Harry . Mrs Edwards said: 'I'm so grateful to Megan for guiding Ashley through the delivery, and I'm really proud of my husband.' Image shows Ms Llewellyn with Toby, Mrs Edwards with Harry, and Mr Edwards with Sophie . The couple, who also have a three-year-old daughter, Sophie, and an 18-month-old son, Harry, have recently been to meet Ms Llewellyn at the ambulance call centre. Mrs Edwards said: ‘We found it interesting to be able to visit the call centre and meet Megan as well as other staff member who assisted Megan on that day. ‘We didn’t realise how many people are involved when you make a 999 call to ensure the correct resources are sent out to assist with the emergency.' Ms Llewellyn says that it was really special for her to be able to meet Toby as she has helped deliver babies in the past but has never heard the outcome before . Ms Llewellyn said: ‘It’s not the first time that I’ve helped deliver a baby over the phone but it’s certainly quite rare and it’s amazing to actually get to meet the parents and the baby who you helped. ‘Often as a call handler we don’t get to hear how an incident turns out so to actually meet baby Toby was fantastic. ‘I remember letting out a deep breath when I heard Toby cry for the first time, I didn’t even realise I’d been holding it. ‘I was just doing my job that day but I’m so glad I was able to make such a difference to the Edwards family.’ Mr Edwards: 'I can see a head. The head is getting there.' Ms Llewellyn: 'Help is already on its way. I will tell you exactly what to do until they arrive.' Mr Edwards: 'The baby is coming. The head's right out. It's coming out. 'The cord its round its neck.' Ms Llewellyn: 'Right, OK, is the baby crying or breathing? Mr Edwards: 'No, no. He's not moving' Ms Llewellyn: 'OK, listen, it's common for the umbilical cord to be wrapped around the baby's neck. 'I'm going to tell you exactly what to do next. Slide your finger under the cord without stretching the cord tight and lift it over the baby's head.' Mr Edwards: 'OK, OK. The cord is over its neck. He is crying.' Ms Llewellyn: 'Well done my love. Now, dry the baby off with a clean towel and wrap it in a clean, dry towel. 'Cover the baby's head but not his face. Put the baby in the mother's arms or on her belly. 'Have you wiped his face and nose? Make sure the cord is not wrapped round his neck. 'Keep the baby and mother warm. 'Have you got a little boy or a little girl sir?' Mr Edwards: 'It's little a boy.'

The world’s most expensive football player, Gareth Bale, is calling for people to help a little boy who lost both his legs to meningitis. Bale, 24, who was just sold to Real Madrid for £86 million, is the latest celebrity to join the campaign to raise money for Luca Williams, four. The footballer joined a host of other celebrities by writing ‘For Luca’ on his palm - then posted a picture of it onto a Facebook page set up for the child. Gareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, has joined the 'For Luca' campaign to help raise £1.5 million to buy prosthetic legs for Luca Williams who lost his legs to meningitis . Luca’s parents, Mo Syed and Sian Williams, are asking people to get involved in the ‘Raise Your Hands for Luca’ campaign to help raise £1.5 million to pay for prosthetic legs. The couple said they were thrilled that Bale had signed up to help their son. Ms Williams, 33, said: ‘It’s amazing that Gareth has done this for Luca at the same time he has become the most valuable footballer ever. ‘He has given our campaign a huge boost and just goes to show what a lovely lad Gareth is.’ Gareth Bale is not the first football star to join the ‘For Luca’ campaign - Maradona wrote the slogan on his hand and posted the picture onto the website as well. Formula One driver Sebastian Vettel, England cricketer Stuart Broad, British Lions captain Sam Warburton, film star Mickey Rourke, pop stars Olly Murs and Pixie Lott and Jamie and Louise Redknapp have also signed up. Luca developed meningitis when he was three. He spent two weeks in intensive care and had to have surgery to amputate both of his legs . Luca displayed no signs of being ill when his parents put him to bed, but when they later checked on him, he was covered in a red rash so they rushed him to hospital where he was diagnosed with meningitis . One supporter even risked his job last year as he tried to get a picture of president Barack Obama while he held his hand up scrawled with the words 'For Luca'. Dai Baker, 39, an award-winning cameraman, who works for Channel 4 News, was told about the initiative by his brother, who is a friend of Luca’s parents. Mr Baker was invited to the Oval Office to have his photo taken with the president after winning a number of prizes for his images.

We might have a reputation for being more restrained than our transatlantic counterparts. But a new study has revealed that far from being buttoned-up, Britons are more than twice as likely as Americans to sleep naked. When asked about their bedroom attire, 30 per cent of Brits admitted to nodding off in the nude – compared with 12 per cent of respondents from the US and just 9 per cent of Germans. In bed: Britons are more likely to sleep naked than citizens of many other countries, new research reveals . The International Bedroom Poll, published by the US National Sleep Foundation, studied the nighttime rituals of people from across the globe. They also found 7 per cent of us go to sleep with socks on – compared with 16 per cent of people in America and 19 per cent of Canadians. The poll also looked into bedroom hygiene, where it was discovered that 55 per cent of British people change their sheets once a week. This makes us over three times cleaner in the bedroom than the Germans, where just 18 per cent change their sheets every seven days. Perhaps this is an attempt to block unpleasant smells because 91 per cent of us claim bad body odour - either their partner’s or their own - distracts them from trying to sleep. Housework: More than half of Brits change their sheets daily, unlike their counterparts in many other countries .

Lord Patten faced demands to quit or be sacked last night as civil war tore through the BBC. The chairman of the BBC Trust was given an ultimatum after being accused of ‘fundamentally misleading’ Parliament over the scandal of excessive pay-offs to Corporation fat cats. But the defiant former Conservative Party chairman said he had ‘no concerns’ about the allegations made by former director general Mark Thompson. Quit or be sacked: The chairman of the BBC Trust Lord Patten, left, was given an ultimatum after being accused of ‘fundamentally misleading’ Parliament over the scandal of excessive pay-offs to Corporation fat cats by former Director General Mark Thompson, right . Mr Thompson has sent a dossier to MPs as he seeks to rebut damaging claims that he was at fault for not making the BBC’s governing body fully aware of controversial payments to former executives Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay. In it, he suggests that Lord Patten was briefed on the pay-offs shortly after taking over as chairman from Sir Michael Lyons in 2011. But in July this year Lord Patten said he ‘didn’t know’ about the full extent of the scandal while giving evidence to MPs. Both men now face a showdown before the influential public accounts committee on Monday. Tory MP Rob Wilson said they were ‘fighting like ferrets in a sack’. Yesterday Mr Wilson said the chairman and three other senior BBC figures should ‘resign immediately or be sacked’ if they were shown to have misled Parliament. Denial: In July this year Lord Patten said he ¿didn¿t know¿ about the full extent of the scandal while giving evidence to MPs . He said Lord Patten, human resources chief Lucy Adams, BBC Trust director Nicholas Kroll and trustee Anthony Fry had all been accused of ‘re-writing history’ by Mr Thompson over the severance payments scandal. Mr Wilson said: ‘They must all be required to answer each of the accusations Mr Thompson has made against them. If they or anyone else is found to have done so without a proper excuse, they will have endangered the integrity and honesty expected of the BBC and must resign immediately or be sacked.’ As the row intensified, former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw declared that the BBC Trust should be scrapped. And in a further twist, Miss Adams –who is quitting as head of HR after signing off multiple big pay-offs to senior managers – confessed that her own evidence to the committee had been ‘mistaken’. Controversy: Mr Thompson has sent a dossier to MPs as he seeks to rebut damaging claims that he was at fault for not making the BBC’s governing body fully aware of controversial payments to former executives Mark Byford, left, and Sharon Baylay, right . Mr Thompson hit out at Lord Patten in a 25-page submission ahead of his committee appearance next week. ‘The picture painted for the PAC by Trust witnesses on July 10 was – in addition to specific untruths and inaccuracies – fundamentally misleading about the extent of Trust knowledge and involvement,’ Mr Thompson claimed. ‘The insinuation that they were kept in the dark by me or anyone else is false and is not supported by the evidence. Here is what Lord Patten and Mark Thompson have said so far about whether the Trust was aware of payments of £1million to departing deputy director general Mark Byford and £394,000 to former marketing director Sharon Baylay: . LORD PATTEN: . At the public accounts committee, on July 10, chairman Margaret Hodge asked him: ‘Should the Trust have known? [about payments exceeding contractual obligations]’ Lord Patten: ‘Yes, and if you call a previous director general of the BBC in due course, I will be as interested as you in why we didn’t know.’ Speaking yesterday he added: ‘I’m obviously going to save my remarks principally until I appear in front of the committee on Monday, which I’m looking forward to. 'I have no concerns at all about the remarks Mr Thompson has made.’ MARK THOMPSON: . In his written submission to MPs, he says: ‘Lord Patten was fully briefed, in writing as well as orally, about the Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay settlements soon after his arrival as chairman in 2011. ‘A detailed briefing on the settlements was prepared for Lord Patten and myself to prepare us for questions from the Press and parliamentarians on the two cases. 'The settlements also came up in a series of preparatory meetings and rehearsals which Lord Patten and I both attended.’ Mr Thompson also encloses a briefing note which he says Lord Patten was given shortly after arriving as BBC Trust chairman in 2011. It sets out questions the BBC might be asked about the sums given to Mr Byford and Miss Baylay, and suggests ways to justify the payments. The note appears to give ammunition to both sides. In one answer, it describes the sums as ‘contractual payments’,  which will be helpful to Lord  Patten because he claims the Trust was unaware of any ‘extra- contractual payments’. But in another answer, the note says Miss Baylay ‘received... payment for notice, a redundancy payment... and an additional compensation payment’, which lends weight to Mr Thompson’s assertion that it was made clear there was money on top of what the BBC was contractually obliged to pay. ‘Lord Patten was fully briefed, in writing as well as orally, about the Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay settlements soon after his arrival as chairman in 2011.’ Mr Thompson has included a copy of the 2011 briefing note with his evidence. He added: ‘Two years later [Lord Patten] would claim he felt “shock and dismay” but in July 2011 he did not raise the topic of senior manager severance at all.’ Lord Patten has denied misleading the committee and has branded Mr Thompson’s submissions ‘bizarre’. He said yesterday that he was relishing the chance to return to the committee, but would save his comments until then. ‘I have no concerns at all about the remarks Mr Thompson has made,’ he said. On July 10 Miss Adams told the public accounts committee she had not seen a crucial note detailing plans for pay-offs – but now she admits she not only saw it but helped write it. Her ‘clarification’ was published after Mr Thompson branded her evidence ‘inexplicable’ because she had been one of the ‘main authors’ of a 2010 note. It set out how £1million of licence fee payers’ money should be lavished on a ‘golden goodbye’ to departing deputy director general Mr Byford and a further £394,000 to former director of marketing Miss Baylay. Their pay-offs were among a string of lucrative severance deals in which £25million was paid to departing BBC staff from 2009 to 2012. BBC bosses past and present are now locked in a bitter war of words over who knew what and when. The astonishing sum was uncovered by the National Audit Office. Mr Wilson said it was not enough for the Trust to dismiss the allegations as ‘bizarre’, adding: ‘The evidence of Mr Thompson has blown a hole in Lord Patten’s argument that the Trust was only responsible for “strategy” and had no operational involvement in executive pay-offs. ‘He [Lord Patten] must urgently shore up confidence in his position and he can only do so by answering each of the specific allegations made by Mark Thompson. The cloud gathering over his position will only darken if he fails to do so.’ But he said the stakes were also high for Mr Thompson, who is now the boss of The New York Times. He said: ‘If Mr Thompson’s allegations are found to be wrong or untruthful, I believe his position as chief executive of The New York Times would be untenable. 'It is not altogether surprising that Mark Thompson and Chris Patten are fighting like ferrets in a sack. 'As the light has been shone into the dark corners of the BBC, people with questions to answer have begun to mount campaigns to save their own skin. 'They’ve been caught out and it’s now become every senior executive for himself.’ Marcus Agius, who was chairman of the executive board remuneration committee, backed Mr Thompson’s version of events. But in a statement, five BBC trustees poured scorn on Mr Thompson’s claims that ‘multiple documents establish’ that details of the pay-offs were disclosed to the Trust before settlements were approved. 'Richard Ayre, Diane Coyle, Anthony Fry, Alison Hastings and David Liddiment said: ‘We were not asked for approval of [Mr Byford’s] financial package – formally or informally – nor did we give it.’ At war: Mark Thompson, Director General of the BBC, and Lord Patten pictured together in 2012 .","Lord Patten faced demands to quit or be sacked after allegations by Mark Thompson .

Millions of patients going for treatment in A&E should see their GP, a paramedic or chemist instead, says a senior NHS official. Professor Keith Willett, who is leading a review of accident and emergency services, said up to 30 per cent of those who use casualty units would be better treated elsewhere. But he admitted that 6.5million patients who needlessly queue at A&E are frustrated by long waits for a GP appointment or lack of access to out-of-hours care. Choices: Patients should see their GP as oppose to clogging up A&E according to a senior NHS official . In an interview to be broadcast on Sky News today, Professor Willett says the NHS review will ‘start to address the demand’ by improving primary care, which he says clearly ‘did not make itself available’ to some patients. England’s A&E departments were in crisis last winter. Waiting times were the worst for nine years, with more than 300,000 patients waiting four hours or more. Professor Willett’s review, published this autumn, will state that all A&E units must always have a consultant available, and other senior doctors on duty, including elderly care specialists. Foreign doctors working in Britain will face language tests if concerns are raised about their fitness to practise. It follows a string of scandals in which overseas doctors have been blamed for poor care. Currently only those from  outside the European Union are given strict language tests, but from next year the doctors’ regulator, the General Medical Council, will test all applicants. In addition, those who are already working can be tested if they are going through disciplinary proceedings. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said: ‘Overseas doctors make a hugely valuable contribution to the NHS but it is clear that tougher checks are needed.’ Paramedics will be sent to treat more patients at home or by the roadside so they do not need hospital care, and patients will be told to ring the 111 helpline to see what care is appropriate. ‘We have to manage the situation and take away from emergency teams those patients who could be managed by other parts of the system,’ he said. ‘We know that 15 to 30 per cent of people who turn up to be treated at A&E could have been treated in general practice. We can look at the way primary care is available to people, by changing the way we deliver services.’ He asked the public to ‘understand the issues’ and consider calling for advice or contacting a GP or pharmacist. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GPs committee, said family surgeries are ‘bursting at the seams’, and the 111 number is not fit for purpose. ‘There is no doubt there are patients who attend A&E who would be better treated in a community setting, but NHS 111 has been fuelling the problem by inappropriately advising patients to go to hospital,’ he said. ‘That needs to be improved so people get quality advice from clinicians, not untrained people using a computer program.’The Government has given the NHS an extra £500million over two years to find short-term solutions to the likely rise in demand for emergency care in the winter.","Professor Keith Willet says NHS will 'start to address the demand'

Police left a seriously injured road crash victim lying in a ditch for five hours near his car after officers failed to find him, a critical report said today. Despite two searches around his vehicle on the A47 near Wisbech officers failed to spot the stricken  driver, 54, and then contacted his family to let them know he was missing. But the man had not moved and was then discovered by the public 'close to the car' hours later, an Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation has found. Crash: The car was found in a ditch here on the A47 near Wisbech but despite two searches police failed to find the driver until the public did five hours later . Experts said the officers should have been more thorough and prevented him getting early treatment for his injured chest and pelvis. 'While there are no specific policies or training for police officers regarding the physical search of a given area in these circumstances, I think the officers should have spent more time and care carrying out searches at the scene,' IPCC commissioner Sarah Green said today. 'The medical evidence indicates the injured man must have been in the ditch, close to the car, at the time the police officers were there, and the officers' failure to find him meant that valuable time was lost before he received medical attention.' The damaged dark blue Peugeot was reported at about 11.20am on July 8, 2012. Police attended and established the identity of the car's owner and visited the registered address but could not find him. Two officers searched the area around the car and, when they failed to find the man, attached 'authorities aware' stickers to the car. At about 4.30pm, members of the public called an ambulance after finding the man in a nearby ditch. He was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn with life threatening injuries. It was later found he had serious injuries to his chest and pelvis, meaning it was unlikely he had moved to the ditch after the police search. The man, who has not been named, survived but is still recovering from his injuries. Discovery: Around five hours after the crash the man was found 'close to the car' and taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn (pictured) The IPCC said the officers' failure did not amount to a criminal offence or misconduct but that action should be taken to prevent future failures. The investigation also found a control room operator breached the Data Protection Act by inappropriately disclosing sensitive information in a telephone call with a member of the injured man's family, soon after the accident. Assistant Chief Constable Charlie Hall, from Norfolk Police, said the force fell short of its expected standards on this occasion. He said: 'While the report acknowledges some of the unique challenges faced by the officers at the scene of this incident, we can only apologise to the victim and his family for the distress caused by their failure to discover him hidden at an earlier opportunity and, later, for the unintentional indiscretion of the control room operator. 'Management action was taken against the two officers to address the performance issues highlighted. 'Lessons learned from the failings identified by the IPCC will be applied to further improve the service we deliver.'","Officers searched around vehicle twice but failed to spot driver, 54 .

David Cameron is promising to fight back against an ‘unholy alliance’ attacking plans for a new high speed rail line after admitting the Government has failed to make an effective case for the project. As ministers brace themselves for a highly critical Parliamentary report on HS2 - the biggest rail project in Britain for more than a century - the Prime Minister launched a passionate defence of it. ‘I would urge the doubters to think big and what this can mean for the country. I accept the government needs to step up and make a really powerful argument,’ said Mr Cameron, speaking at the G20 summit in St Petersburg. HS2 rail line . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is expected to respond to a critical report from MPs on the spiralling costs of HS2 next week with a major speech making a fresh case for the potential economic benefits. There is also speculation that Mr Cameron may appoint a dedicated ‘minister for HS2’ in a Government reshuffle expected after next month’s Conservative party conference. Currently, it is among the responsibilities of transport minister Simon Burns. Some suggest former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis, one of the main cheerleaders for the project, could be asked to take on the role for the Government. Objectors say it will cost too much to get HS2 up and running from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. The official cost of the project, including contigency funds, has recently climbed from £33 billion to £42.6 billion. Former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson, ex-chancellor and former transport secretary Alistair Darling, and ITV chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman have all cast doubt on the scheme in recent weeks. The objectors, who also include David Cameron’s stepfather-in-law Viscount Astor, say the project will cause an unacceptable level of environmental damage, loss of homes and disruption to many communities. David Cameron has vowed to fight back against an 'unholy alliance' attacking plans for a new high speed rail line . But Mr Cameron attacked those who have criticised the project - singling out Lord Mandelson, the leader of UKIP and the Financial Times newspaper, which has repeatedly cast doubt on the economic case. ‘There has never been a blank cheque for HS2 but I’m passionately in favour of this project and we need to respond to the criticism that’s been made,’ the Prime Minister. ‘There’s an unholy alliance between the Financial Times, Peter Mandelson and Nigel Farage who want to give up on projects to make our country competitive and fit for the 21st century. ‘Every other country in the world has got on board for high speed rail. ‘I absolutely refuse to accept we can have a booming south-east corridor closest to the continent and rest of the economy won’t benefit.’ Citing the success of the Olympics and the Crossrail project, currently under construction, the Prime Minister aded: ‘We need to fight back with a vigorous campaign we can do extraordinary things in terms of infrastructure. ‘I would urge the doubters to think big and what this can mean for the country. I accept the government needs to step up and make a really powerful argument.’ The Prime Minister argues that HS2 is essential if Britain is to be a winner in the so-called ‘global race’. Britain lags far behind high-speed rail developments in countries such as Saudi Arabia – which has 342 miles – and Morocco, with 422 miles. Downing Street sources said similar objections now raised against HS2 had been made in decades gone by to the M25, Channel Tunnel and Jubilee Line. Nick Clegg warned London’s status as a ‘global powerhouse’ will be threatened if the High Speed 2 rail line does not go ahead. The Deputy Prime Minister claimed the UK is a ‘laggard’ when it comes to investing in transport infrastructure, and can no longer compete with the rising cities of China and Brazil. Following a summer of criticism of the rising costs of the project, Mr Clegg made an impassioned defence of HS2, saying connecting the capital to the northern cities was the only way to prevent a ‘never ending sprawl across the green belt outside of London.’","There is also speculation that Mr Cameron may appoint a dedicated ‘minister for HS2 .

Kwik-Fit mechanics have been accused of ripping off customers by tricking them into paying for work they did not need. The garage chain has been criticised after staff tried to con mystery shoppers into paying for more than £700 worth of work which was not necessary in an undercover investigation. The team from the new BBC1 consumer show Your Money, Their Tricks, made the allegations after sending 10 cars into 10 Kwik-Fit branches across Britain for a 'free brake check' and 'free tyre check'. BBC presenter Nicky Campbell on the show, which found Kwik-Fit mechanics allegedly attempting to con mystery shoppers . All of the cars had been examined by a top expert before and after they were taken in to the garages. The BBC, which did not reveal the specific locations of the garages, has said Kwik-Fit tried to trick the mystery shoppers into paying for more than £700 worth of work by exaggerating the urgency on 4 of the 10 cars. The programme's reporter Rebecca Wilcox said: 'I was shocked by what we uncovered and disappointed that we found such a large well-known company on occasions exaggerating the urgency and quoting for unnecessary work and not carrying out all the checks they promised and as a car owner and car lover this story was very close to my heart. 'In this time when every penny counts it’s really disappointing that some companies might mislead and trick potential customers into spending more than they have to. 'A lot of work went into uncovering the tricks in this episode - it was a large scale investigation. Working with our expert John was definitely an eye opener, I wish I could have him with me whenever I need to put my car in the garage. 'I consider myself to be a minor petrol head and was very surprised by how easy it can be to be misled.' BBC reporter Rebecca Wilcox said she was 'shocked' by what was uncovered in the programme . The broadcaster has said as part of the full tyre and brake checks the mechanics should have examined the tyre pressures and tread and taken the wheels off to measure the brake pads and discs but they failed to do this on a number of occasions. The BBC said the mechanics also failed to spot nails in the tyres and did not notice some tyres were dangerously underinflated. A BBC spokesman said: 'In fact, our expert found that Kwik-Fit had failed to do the full checks on seven out of the ten cars' Kwik-Fit has said it 'seriously disagrees' with most of the BBC's findings and stands by 'the majority of the recommendations we gave' (file picture) A Kwik-Fit spokesman has said: 'From the limited information the BBC has provided in advance of its broadcast we, and an independent expert, seriously disagree with most of its findings. 'As a result of our detailed response to its allegations, the BBC has accepted that a number of its conclusions were wrong. 'In a few cases we fully accept that our staff could have been clearer with their communication; for this we apologise and are intent on improving how we communicate our advice to customers. 'From the limited information the BBC . has provided in advance of its broadcast we, and an independent expert, . seriously disagree with most of its findings' - A Kwik-Fit spokesman . 'However, we stand by the majority of the recommendations we gave, and completely reject the way the BBC has calculated the cost of work it has deemed ""unnecessary"" by not considering how worn these parts were. 'We have even made the BBC four separate offers for one car to be re-inspected at an independent laboratory in order to put our diagnosis to the test. The BBC continues to decline this offer. 'We have zero tolerance of staff recommending unnecessary work and any proven cases result in disciplinary action. We have a whistleblower line on which staff can anonymously report any aspect of malpractice from their colleagues and a senior management team will investigate and act on any reports. 'Any recommendations we make on replacing parts take into account manufacturers’ information and advice from organisations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA). 'The wear of items such as tyres and brake pads is not an exact science, but we believe ours is a professional and responsible approach which focuses first and foremost on the safety of our four and a half million customers.' Ms Wilcox said 'a lot of work went into uncovering the tricks' used by the companies involved in the programme . The garage said staff are regularly audited through its own mystery shopping programmes. A spokesman said: 'We expect high standards to be delivered across all areas of our business, and continue to make significant investment in training our staff. We take customer feedback very seriously and guarantee to take any remedial action required, should our procedures be less than satisfactory, which was the case in a minority of the BBC's mystery shop exercise. 'It is notable that our customer . complaints have fallen by 28 per cent over the last year and we are . proud of a customer satisfaction level of 98 per cent.' The . programme makers say the sales tactics used by staff at one of the UK's . leading car supermarket Carcraft have also been revealed in the . episode. 'In this time when every penny counts . it’s really disappointing that some companies might mislead and trick . potential customers into spending more than they have to' - BBC reporter Rebecca Wilcox . The BBC said salesmen revealed they advertised cars as much as £2,000 cheaper on their website in order to 'get people through the door'. During their six visits to six Carcraft branches the team say they have uncovered a number of tactics designed to get customers to part with their cash including lying about the pre-sale checks. One sales manager admitted to an undercover mole who applied for a job with the company: 'you’ve basically got to get them in and you gotta hammer them into a car when they are here. 'You’ve basically got to beat people up without them knowing you’re beating them up and get them to love you for it.' A Carcraft spokesman said: 'We provide quality cars with an industry leading warranty package that includes one year’s free servicing, a free MOT in the first year and a 12 month extended guarantee in addition to comprehensive RAC Breakdown Cover and Accident Care. 'Our cars are accredited by the RAC which was awarded following comprehensive audits by RAC engineers at all of our Preparation Centres and involves substantive audits of our cars at every site every month. We always score very high ratings across all our sites. 'Price alone doesn't determine a good deal as the part exchange price and the finance package combined determines the best overall deal and we're confident that our deals and quality of cars are aligned to our customer needs. 'We have strict pricing policies and will review the BBC footage and take action against any individuals that haven't adhered to our policies. In addition, we are evaluating our training and monitoring procedures. 'We apologise unreservedly to any customers affected.'

A driver has been unwittingly given a £60 fine for driving in a bus lane when the actual offender was the council’s own roadsweeper. Jonathan Palgrave, 32, was stunned to receive the penalty notice from Sheffield City Council despite having never visited the city. The fine was sent to Mr Palgrave’s house, almost 100 miles away in Spalding, Lincolnshire, along with a photograph of the offending vehicle. Rego's wrong: Jonathan Palgrave was unwittingly fined £60 for driving in a bus lane in Sheffield - a city he had never visited before - after the council mixed up the 'E' in his number plate with 'B' in the offending vehicle's plates . Is it 'B' or 'E'? The council included this image of the offending vehicle, its number plate in clear view but it is not Mr Palgrave's Tiger kit car, rather it is a council roadsweeper in the bus lane . But the photo revealed a Sheffield City Council roadsweeper in the bus lane driven by a council worker wearing a fluorescent jacket on August 21. On closer inspection Mr Palgrave, who drives a Tiger kit car – not a roadsweeper, noticed that his number plate was exactly the same as the roadsweeper’s bar one letter, the council mixing up a ‘B’ for an ‘E’. But when Jonathan contacted the authority to point out their mistake, he was stunned to be told by council workers that he must still go through the authority’s official statutory complaints procedure before the fine could be overturned. He was also told the penalty could rise up to £90 if he failed to pay the fine within 28 days and threatened with possible legal action if it still wasn’t paid after that. 'Bureaucratic nightmare': Mr Palgrave contacted the council about the fine (right) after noticing that the offending roadsweeper (left) had a very similar number plate, but was told that he still had to go through the authority's official complaints procedure. The council have since cancelled the fine . Bus lane bumble: This intersection on the Ring Road in Wicker is where the bus lane camera caught the roadsweeper . Mr Palgrave said today: ‘It’s just been a bureaucratic nightmare and it makes you wonder if it has happened before. ‘It makes you want to know if it’s all automated or if someone looks at what they are actually sending out. ‘I think I might write back on the form “have a look on the back” so they look and see their own sweeper. ‘When . I first got it I just thought “oh my god, where have I been?” I thought . I was going to have to pay the fine. Then I realised I have never been . to Sheffield in my life, let alone driven there. ‘When I turned over the form I just laughed, there was the picture of this huge sweeper just sweeping the curb. ‘They . must have just mistaken the E in my car’s registration for the B in the . sweepers, that’s the difference, other than them being completely . different cars. Should check their records: Mr Palgrave, who has owned the £17,000 Tiger kit car for three months, said he has felt angry but not can't help but laugh at the mix up . ‘I’m almost tempted to wait and take this to court and see what they say when it all gets to court. ‘I’ve felt every emotion going - at first I was angry, then confused and now I can’t help but laugh about it. ‘To send a picture of their own vehicle, which they will have records of is brilliant. ‘They should really check those records from time to time.’ Mr Palgrave has owned the £17,000 kit car for three months. He said: ‘I’m happy with my kit car for now but perhaps I could avoid any potential parking and speeding tickets in future if I bought a council road sweeper.’ The letter from Sheffield City Council informed Mr Palgrave of his Bus Lane Penalty Charge Notice under the Transport Act 2000. It read: ‘The alleged contravention has been detected and recorded by an Approved CCTV device. ‘Sheffield City Council having reason therefore to believe that a penalty charge notice is payable, serves this PCN on you, as the person appearing to the Council to be the owner of the vehicle of the person liable to pay the penalty charge.’ Sheffield City Council today apologised for the embarrassing error and agreed to cancel the penalty notice. A spokesperson said: 'The ticket has now been cancelled and we apologise for the confusion. This is the first time this kind of mistake has happened.'","Owner of a Tiger kit car, Jonathan Palgrave was stunned to receive the fine .

A council has admitted making a 'ridiculous' mistake after it put double yellow lines across a busy T-junction. Bungling workers painted a no-parking zone outside Workington Community Hospital in Cumbria because they were using maps from before it was built. Baffled drivers say the situation is an 'embarrassment' and a 'waste of . cash' because Cumbria County Council will have to get them removed. 'Never in all my life have I seen anything so stupid - I just really couldn't believe it,' local man Bryan Allred said.

Taxi driver Ray Cottier said he's been driving around Workington since he was 17 and he's never come across anything as peculiar. 'The lines have gone right across the junction - I've never seen anything like it before,' he said. Colleague Ian Melville said: 'It's ridiculous. You can't paint double yellow lines across the entrance of a hospital - what on earth were they thinking?' A Cumbria County Council spokesman admitted it was an error but it could be weeks until they are removed.

Bizarre: Drivers have called the mistake outside Workington Community Hospital 'the most stupid thing we've ever seen' 'During routine highway maintenance it seems a plan was used showing the markings as they were previously and unfortunately the external lining contractor mistakenly re-installed the old lines.

If you want to keep your car out of the hands of thieves, don’t drive a Suzuki in central Manchester. Research reveals the city is now  the car crime capital of England  and Wales. And drivers of Suzukis face the highest risk of having their car stolen. Worst of the worst: Manchester's city centre is the least safe place to park your car . The findings come from analysis of police car crime figures obtained following a Freedom of Information request by consumer website Honest John. It said in a report that the highest incidence of vehicle-related crime in the country is in Manchester’s M2 postcode, which covers most of the city centre, where almost one in three cars (32 per cent) is affected. The report said: ‘Between October 2011 and September 2012, 3,180 crimes per 10,000 cars on the road were reported in Manchester city centre, with theft of possessions accounting for almost half of the cases.’ Liverpool’s central L1 postcode recorded the second highest number of offences with 22 per cent of cars (2,193 offences) affected, followed by Bradford’s BD1 area, with a car crime rate of 21 per cent (2,137 offences), and Birmingham’s B4 postcode with 18 per cent (1,800 offences). In London, the EC2 postcode is the worst affected area with 12 per cent of cars subject to crime (1,228 offences), putting it tenth on the league table. When whole cities rather than individual postcodes are counted Manchester again emerges at the top with 505 crimes per 10,000 cars. By manufacturer, Suzuki had the highest proportionate rate of thefts. For every 10,000 Suzukis on the road some 93 are stolen. That compares with second place Mitsubishi at 42 per 10,000. Individual models most at risk from thieves are, in order, the Mitsubishi Shogun/Pajero, Nissan Sunny. Nissan Bluebird, BMW X6 and Ford Orion . Cars safest from thieves are the Peugeot 508, Skoda Roomster, Skoda Yeti, Suzuki Splash and Suzuki SX4. The research reveals that 41 per cent of offences were based on theft from a vehicle, making it the most common type of car crime. Next was criminal damage at 40 per cent, followed by theft of a car at 16 per cent. HonestJohn.co.uk says its Car Crime Census 2013 is the first ever detailed analysis of 515,248 recorded car crimes between October 2011 and September 2012 released by 42 police forces across England and Wales following a Freedom of Information request.","Manchester city centre worst for vehicle crimes in England and Wales .

An ‘ultra-fit’ police officer died taking part in his first ever Ironman triathlon in New York, an inquest has heard. Andrew Naylor, 43, was pulled out of the Hudson River during the swimming leg of the 140-mile triathlon. A post-mortem examination revealed the father-of-three drowned after a blocked artery caused him to have a heart attack. Andrew Naylor, 43, was pulled out of the Hudson River during the swimming leg of New York's 140-mile Ironman triathlon last year after he suffered a heart attack which caused him to drown . Just a week earlier he and a friend won a gruelling endurance race in Hong Kong where Mr Naylor was a police superintendent. He was one of 2,500 athletes taking part in last year’s Iron Man U.S. championships in New York. He was about an hour into the 2.4 mile swim, the first part of the race, which was due to followed by a 112 mile bike ride, and then a marathon over a 26.2mile course, when he fell ill. Victoria Broomfield, representing the Iron Man championships, said swimmers were supervised by several rescue boats manned by lifeguards and paramedics. She said in a statement: ‘As soon as Mr Naylor was spotted in difficulty he was pulled out of the water and resuscitation attempts made while the boat made for shore. ‘An ambulance took him to a nearby hospital but he died later.’ He was about an hour into the 2.4 mile swim, the first part of the race, which was due to followed by a 112 mile bike ride, and then a marathon over a 26.2mile course, when he fell ill . Mr Naylor’s body was flown home to Anglesey, North Wales, where he and his wife, Lynn, have a home. An inquest in Caernarfon heard the highly-decorated police officer would have been unaware of his heart problem. Dr Tony Caslin told the hearing: ‘The abnormality in his heart may not have been identified and became apparent during a period of extensive exertion. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death . ‘He may have had the condition over several years and may have been entirely unaware of its presence.’ Dr Caslin said the condition could have been easily treated if it had been diagnosed. North West Wales coroner Dewi Pritchard Jones said: ‘Had he not been swimming in these extreme circumstances he would not have died in this way.’ Mr Naylor set his personal best time of two hours and 32 minutes in the 2009 London Marathon when he finished in 74th place. He won the China Coast Half Marathon in 2008. As an officer with the Criminal Intelligence Bureau, he was awarded the Student of Merit award for his ‘outstanding performance’. He mainly worked in the counter-terrorism unit during his 20-year career, beginning when he emigrated from the UK to Asia in 1992. The police officer’s mother Gaby said: ‘He was an ultra-fit athlete who had run in numerous marathons. ‘He had prepared for this event so well and was over the moon to be able to take part. ‘It is such a tragedy he has died. I am devastated to have lost a son.’ His wife, who did not attend the hearing, said at the time: ‘It gives me some comfort that Andy died doing something he loved, but we will miss him sorely.’ The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.","Andrew Naylor died last year during the Ironman triathlon in New York .

A benefit cheat who claimed he could not walk and swindled £20,000 in disability payments has walked free from court despite being caught out by officers after he was filmed boxing. Mark Ashman, 51, pocketed thousands after he told the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) his arthritis was so bad he required round-the-clock care. But he was exposed when fraud investigators found YouTube footage of him sparring with a partner in an outdoor boxing ring. The brazen boxer's open-air display was part of last year's Olympic torch relay. But . Ashman, who also ran a security company while claiming incapacity . benefits and disability living allowance, was spared jail at . Wolverhampton Magistrates Court yesterday. Magistrates . handed him an eight-week jail term suspended for six months after he . admitted two counts of failing to notify a change in circumstances. Chair of the bench Ted Crutchley said Ashman was spared jail because of his early guilty plea. He . said: 'This is a custodial sentence but we are prepared to suspend it . on the condition you do not commit any further offences. 'We pass this sentence because of the . length of time the offences were committed over and the substantial . amount of money which was taken from the system.' Scroll down for video . Mark Ashman, 51, (right) pocketed thousands of pounds in disability allowance on the basis it would take him ten minutes just to walk 100 yards and required round the clock care . But he was exposed when fraud investigators found YouTube footage of him sparring with a partner in an outdoor boxing ring . Ashman was also ordered to pay £100 prosecution costs and an £80 surcharge. After his sentence was handed down surprised Ashman asked magistrates if he could leave the court. He said: 'I'm free to go now?' Suki Rai told the court Ashman had claimed his arthritis was so bad he was placed in the 'virtually unable to walk' category and awarded a higher level of benefits. She said: 'Mr Ashman was capable of undertaking activity that appeared to be incompatible with his benefits. 'He was capable of coaching boxing and the club confirmed he was self-employed with his day and night security business. 'With regards to his disability allowance his last self-assessment was in 1999. 'He said that due to arthritis in his right knee he was very disabled and needed care and often found it very difficult to walk without a walking stick. 'He said his walking ability was restricted to 100 yards which would take him ten minutes to walk this distance. 'An allegation was received that Mr Ashman was capable to walk and that he had a security firm.' The brazen boxer's open-air display was part of last year's Olympic torch relay . Ashman, of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, received £9,182.05 in disability benefits between March 1, 2009 and August 12, 2012. He also claimed £12,560.43 in incapacity benefit between October 1, 2009 and January 2, 2012. Ashman was captured on camera outside Wolverhampton's Boxing Club gym taking part in a demonstration on a torch bearers route for last year's Olympics. The respected coach even trained fighters from the Caribbean island of Dominica to prepare them for the Games. The footage shows Ashman jumping around the ring with boxing pads as a bulky fighter delivers powerful blows. Debbie Starrs, defending, said Ashman had initially submitted a genuine claim but did not tell the DWP when his condition improved. She said: 'The mischief in this case is that he should have notified them sooner than he in fact did. 'He wishes not only to pay his taxes and be an active member of society but wants to create employment. 'He appreciates there are young people out there who are not given the opportunity to achieve their potential.' A DWP spokesperson said after the hearing: 'It's cases like these that show us why welfare reform is needed. 'We have a duty to the taxpayer and our customers to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them. 'Benefit fraud takes money away from the most vulnerable. 'It is a crime and we are committed to stopping it by catching criminals at the front line and making sure our reforms make the benefit system less open to abuse.'","Mark Ashman, 51, pocketed thousands after claiming he could barely walk .

Professor Jardine said the problem stemmed from the fact that ¿everyone at the BBC is trained in the humanities' The BBC is peddling dumbed-down science, one of the country’s leading academics has claimed. Professor Lisa Jardine, who heads UK fertility watchdog and is president of the British Science Association, said the corporation underestimates how much its viewers and listeners understand. She said that programme-makers steeped in the humanities assume that members of the public are as ignorant about science as they are. In fact, the belief is a ‘complete fallacy’ as many members of the audience have degrees and are perfectly capable of understanding complex terms and issues. Professor Jardine said she had experienced the phenomenon first-hand while making a series called the Seven Ages of Science for Radio 4. She said that ‘anyone who has done broadcasting for the BBC’ will know that while references to prominent figures in the arts go unchallenged, requests are made for scientific terms to be put into ‘ordinary language’. Professor Jardine said programme-makers frequently say that their mother wouldn’t understand complex terminology – but this is no excuse. ‘Many mothers now have PhDs so let’s leave out the mothers.’ And, in a reference to the values of Lord Reith, the founder of the BBC, she said: ‘In the rising age-groups, 45 per cent of that cohort went to university for goodness sake, so this sort of Reithian idea that you are having to pre-digest, mash up the difficult stuff and particularly science because people are not able to understand it, is a complete fallacy.’ Professor Jardine, who has chaired the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority since 2008 and heads the humanities department at University College London, said the problem stemmed from the fact that ‘everyone at the BBC is trained in the humanities’. She said that although changes are being made, the science unit is still ‘tiny’ compared to the arts department. She added that other broadcasters are also guilty of underestimating their audience. Her comments will form part of presidential address to the British Science Festival in Newcastle next week, in which she will talk about how the problem also pervades the way science policy is presented to the public. BBC science presenters Professor Brian Cox and Dara O'Briain . Others said that science programmes focus on entertainment at the expense of education. Professor Craig Jackson, head of the psychology department at Birmingham, said that when he was making a programme for Channel 5, it was suggested that viewers text in the name of their favourite serial killer. He added that programmes need to devote more time to explaining complex issues. The BBC, which has previously been accused of dumbing down shows from the Today programme to Gardeners’ World said that it broadcasts science during peak viewing hours and in recent years has put more working scientists on TV and radio than any other channel. Presenters include Professor Brian Cox, Professor Alan Roberts and comedian Dara O’Briain. A spokesman added: ‘The BBC’s mission is to stimulate the audience’s curiosity and interest in science, across television, radio and online. ‘We serve a very broad audience from those with no pre-existing interest in science through to those who already have an appetite for or knowledge of science; our content goes out a primetime and is presented by experts in their fields.’","Noted scientist says broadcaster's coverage is too dumbed down .

Pressure: Ed Miliband's stance on Syria has been questioned by senior party figures . Ed Miliband is coming under growing pressure from Labour heavyweights for his refusal to back the government on military action in Syria. Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair said the Labour leader had got it wrong in the crunch Commons vote as former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said the party’s foreign policy had been reduced to ‘being nice to Iran’. Mr Miliband faces growing division in his party over his decision to vote down the government, even after David Cameron moved to accept his concerns about not rushing to war. The Labour leader initially said he backed a ‘limited’ strike against Syria, but urged Mr Cameron to tone down a government motion on military strikes for last week’s vote. But the Prime Minister’s call for action was rejected by a majority of 13 MPs after 39 coalition MPs joined with Labour to inflict a humiliating defeat. Today Mr Blair issued his first major rebuke of the Labour leader, saying he disagreed with the way Mr Miliband had handled the who affair. The former prime minister said: ‘I wrote before the vote that I thought we had to support action in Syria and I said after the vote that I was disappointed by it. ‘So this is something where I just have to disagree with the leadership of the party. ‘But I know it’s a difficult position for political leaders to be put in when they’ve got to take decisions like this, but my position on these issues is pretty clear over a long period of time.’ He was backed by Mr Bradshaw, a foreign office minister in the Blair government who was promoted to Culture Secretary by Gordon Brown. The Exeter MP warned a ‘considerable number of Labour MPs (many more than have so said so publicly) feel deeply uneasy about’ the fact that Mr Miliband has ruled out a second vote on military action. Writing in the Guardian, Mr Bradshaw expressed alarm that Mr Miliband was following the Prime Minister's lead rather than taking a ‘sensible and measured approach’. On Wednesday Mr Miliband insisted the Commons vote was not about Britain 'shirking its responsibilities' but about preventing a 'rush' to war. He repeatedly argued that the key was now bringing other countries to the table - including Iran - to help negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. But in a a direct swipe at Mr Miliband's approach, Mr Bradshaw said: ‘Does being nice to Iran and talking about Britain's now diminished diplomatic and humanitarian role constitute a foreign policy? ‘Labour needs to have clear and unambiguous answers to these questions. They will dominate politics through the party conference season.’ Division: Tony Blair said Mr Miliband had got it wrong on Syria while former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said many Labour MPs were 'uneasy' about the leader's position . Mr Bradshaw said the amendment Labour tabled to the Government motion setting out five conditions for military action last week was ‘clear and sound’. ‘Instead of sticking to this sensible and measured approach, we seem to have abandoned it because of the incompetence of a Tory prime minister’ he said. ‘We have allowed Labour foreign policy to be dictated by the Government.’ It comes after David Miliband put himself at odds with brother Ed to warn that international intervention in Syria is ‘increasingly necessary’. The former foreign secretary condemned the failure of western governments including Britain to ‘break the diplomatic and military deadlock’ and warned humanitarian aid cannot reach refugees because aid agencies are coming under ‘aerial bombardment’. His warning that Syria risks becoming a ‘dangerous no-man’s-land’ like Afghanistan appears at odds with Ed Miliband’s insistence that Labour will not back a second vote on UK military intervention.","Ex-Prime Minister says Labour leader was wrong to oppose military action .

A 13-year-old boy was sent home on his first day of school because of an 'offensive' haircut. Kyle McGeever made it two hours into the academic year at John Henry Newman Catholic College in Birmingham before he was told to leave. He was one of three pupils who were punished for breaching the rules with a new style yesterday. Kyle McGeever, 13, from Birmingham, has been sent home from school because his hair was too short . Furious mother Rebecca Cartwright blasted the school for overreacting. Ms Cartwright, 33, said: 'I was told I needed to pick Kyle up as his haircut wasn’t respectable, was offensive, and didn’t comply with school policy. 'I don’t see how they can deny him his education. It’s taking it too far.' It is the second time the teenager has been in trouble over his hair. Last year he was forced to study alone for a week when he modelled himself on Cristiano Ronaldo. Ms Cartwright added: 'While sitting in the foyer waiting to speak to the head, I saw kids in Kyle’s year who had shorter hair and the Cristiano Ronaldo V-cut hairstyle. 'That was the haircut Kyle had last year when they put him in isolation for a week. They need to have one rule for all the kids.' But head teacher Jennifer McGuirk rebuffed the family's claims. Furious mother Rebecca Cartwright blasted the school for letting other children cut their hair as they wished . Ms McGuirk said: 'It was the first day of school and, if students didn’t have the correct uniform, we gave them the chance to go home and correct it.' 'Other students were sent home. As far as I’m aware, of the three pupils who had extreme haircuts, Kyle was the only one not to return to school with it blended in. 'It wasn’t an exclusion - any student coming in without the correct uniform, in trainers or denim for example, would be sent home to get changed.

Serial thief: Joshua Bennetts, 21, from the Longlevens area of Gloucester, was blasted for his contribution to a 'crime wave of bicycle thefts' A 21-year-old serial thief walked free from court yesterday despite admitting his 70th crime. Joshua Bennetts, of Gloucester, was blasted by Judge Jamie Tabor QC for his involvement in a ‘crime wave of bicycle thefts’ in the city. He appeared at Gloucester Crown Court after stealing two bikes together worth up to £1,300 with equally-prolific offender Rhys Shardlow, 20, who now has 63 offences to his name. Judge Tabor said no sentence had yet deterred Bennetts, adding: ‘I cannot overlook your simply appalling criminal record. Sixty-nine previous offences. More than 20 of them for dishonesty.’ Bennetts and Shardlow denied burgling the property of an Adrian Harper to take the bikes, which the prosecution accepted. Both thieves had been in custody since their arrest in May, although Bennetts was recently bailed. Judge Tabor sentenced Bennetts to a five-month overnight curfew until February 1, after he had served the past few months in custody. ‘I don’t know what is going to stop you offending,’ he said. ‘All I can do is recognise the fact that you have spent some time in prison on remand for these offences. They are not trivial. Stealing bicycles in Gloucester is an epidemic and these were valuable bikes, not some old jalopies.’ He has pleaded guilty in previous years . to the likes of aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving, possessing . cannabis and theft. The judge adjourned sentencing on Shardlow for two weeks, telling him he would not send him to jail if he could be found suitable accommodation. But Shardlow told the judge he would refuse to go into a hostel and would rather stay in prison. He wanted to stay with friends until he found his own accommodation, he said. The judge remanded him in custody - saying if he refused to accept a hostel place, he might have to be jailed. Hearing: Judge Jamie Tabor QC said at Gloucester Crown Court that no sentence had yet deterred Bennetts . Hearing: Bennetts was one of two defendants appearing at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) over the theft of two bikes jointly worth up to £1,300 - the other being equally-prolific offender Rhys Shardlow, 20 . The prosecution applied for a criminal anti-social behaviour order (Crasbo) against both men to restrict their freedom and movement in a bid to curb their crimes. But the defence objected to its terms. Steve Young, defending, said prosecutors' call for a two-year curfew would be such an imposition on the defendants that it could be a human rights breach. Judge Tabor said: ‘I would not impose a two year curfew but I would make a no-go area and a ban on association between them.’ He adjourned the Crasbo issue until September 19 so the defence and prosecution could discuss the order's terms. The judge added that he was concerned bicycle thefts were an ‘epidemic’ in the city. ‘These young men are part of a crime wave which is well known in the town at the moment,’ he said. ‘Theft of cycles is at epidemic proportions. I am well aware of that. Big problem: The judge said he was concerned bicycle thefts were an 'epidemic' in Gloucester (file picture) ‘These two have a remarkable number of previous convictions for dishonesty and generally bad behaviour. The court has so far failed to deter them from laying their hands on other people’s property as if it is their own. 'I cannot overlook your simply appalling criminal record. Sixty-nine previous offences. More than 20 of them for dishonesty' Judge Jamie Tabor QC . ‘They have so far singularly failed to follow anything the court directs for anything other than a short period of time.’ Sarah Jenkins, for Shardlow, said he no longer had an address to go to when he leaves prison because his family have moved and were not in contact with him. Judge Tabor said: ‘My task is to protect the public from his persistent bad behaviour. I find that very difficult to do if I don’t have an address where I can keep an eye on him.’ The judge told Shardlow: ‘I am not in a position to sentence you until I know where you are going to live. We are going to find somewhere for you.’ Shardlow retorted: ‘I won’t live in a hostel. I won’t go there. I would rather stay in prison.’ But the judge said: ‘Well, we might have to find another hostel for you downstairs.’","Joshua Bennetts blasted for contribution to 'crime wave of bicycle thefts'

Polls show Tony Abbott's Liberal-National coalition heading for a landslide victory . Tony Abbott, leader of Australia's opposition party, looks set to win the country's national election on Saturday ending six years of Labour rule. Pledging to be 'a leader for everyone' the father of three said: 'If it happens, I will be extraordinarily conscious of the heavy burden of responsibility, of the duties, the extraordinary duties, that will have descended upon my shoulders.' A Fairfax Media poll on Friday showed Mr Abbott's Liberal-National coalition with a 54 to 46 per cent lead. However current Prime Minister Kevin Rudd refused to rule his party out, saying: 'There is fight in the old dog yet. 'I believe we can do it. This is not wishful thinking – it's a matter of looking at the maths.' If Abbott does win, he will have successfully fought off criticism, some of it from within his own party, that he had become unelectable. A series of high-profile political gaffes over the years had left him unpopular with the Australian public, particularly after being labelled as 'sexist' and 'a misogynist' by the ex-Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The staunch conservative and monarchist also once listed a female candidate's 'sex appeal' as a political asset, and accidentally drew laughter while saying that nobody is 'the suppository of all wisdom.' Fitness fanatic and ex-Oxford University boxer Abbott says an election win will not interrupt his morning run . However Bob Hawke, the former Australian Labour prime minister, said Labour's six years in power have been a 'bloody mixed bag' and blamed the party for underestimating Mr Abbott.Speaking to Sky News he said: 'A lot of the Labour party in the last 12 months or so made the mistake of underrating Tony.' 'Tony has historically been capable of some awful gaffes, as people will tell you ... but he's shown considerable discipline in his campaign.' If Labour are defeated it will mean humiliation for them, having unceremoniously dumped their former leader, and Austrlia's fist female PM, Julia Gillard in the hopes of reviving their appeal. Current Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (left) was brought in by the Labour party to replace Australia's first female PM Julia Gillard (right) in the hope it would revive their standing in the polls . While Rudd, a mandarin-speaking ex-diplomat, remained consistently ahead of Abbott in the opinion polls until this week, he has failed to reignite his party. By contrast Abbott has punished Labour's errors at every turn while campaigning on pledges to cut carbon and mining taxes. He has also promised to take a tougher stance towards asylum seekers arriving by boat, to reduce spending and foreign aid, cut the public service and introduce one of the world's most generous parental leave schemes. The fitness fanatic and ex-Oxford . University boxer said that the win, if it comes, would not disrupt his . morning run, though conceded he would be in for briefings later 'because you can't muck around with something as . important as the future of our country.'","Despite being unpopular in opinion polls victory looks likely for Abbott .

He had covered his face before attempting the crime, but police were able to track him down thanks to his distinctive eyebrows and heavily-lined forehead. Paul Shough was caught on CCTV (left) holding up a betting shop, but officers could trace him thanks to his eyebrows . Shough pleaded guilty to robbery and possession of an imitation firearm at an earlier hearing. CCTV footage from the robbery shows Shough walking in to the shop and approaching staff with what looked like a gun covered with a white plastic bag. He was wearing a black hoodie and had a scarf around the lower half of his face, but his eyebrows were still clearly visible. The distinctive feature allowed police to . find Shough after the robbery, which took place on 30 April this year. Thanks to the image being circulated, a local police officer recognised Shough's face, which led to him being charged with robbery on 4 May. Despite covering his face, Shough could be identified by officers thanks to his distinctive eyebrows . Detective Constable Damian Forrest, from West Midlands Police CID, said: ‘We are pleased with the sentence. ‘Although no-one was physically injured during the robbery, the staff at Coral believed Shough was carrying a weapon in the bag and were left deeply traumatised by the experience. ‘They believed they would be shot if they didn’t do as he demanded. ‘There was absolutely no doubt it was our man.

Popular landlord George Wilson, 41, was stabbed to death outside the Fox & Hounds in Nottingham 50 years ago . Detectives are asking the public to help them solve the unresolved murder of a landlord who was stabbed to death outside his pub five decades ago. The bloodied body of George Wilson, 41, was found yards from the front door of the Fox and Grapes pub in Nottingham minutes after he took his dog for a late-night walk in the early hours of September 8 ,1963. The unsolved case - know has the Pretty Windows Murder because of the pub's attractive frontage - led to five confessions, but all of them were deemed fake by police. Mr Wilson, who had a six-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son, had been stabbed 13 times with a six-inch Bowie knife but no money had been taken from his wallet, which suggested to police that his murder was personal rather than random. His wife Alberta found him lying in the street after she heard their mongrel Blackie scratching at the door and saw the dog was covered in blood. Post mortem tests revealed the popular landlord had been stabbed in the base of the skull, face and back. The murder weapon was found by two young boys nine days later in a ditch, and traces of Mr Wilson’s blood were found on the sheath and the blade which was bent at the tip. However, his killer has never been caught. Now Nottinghamshire Police have reopened their investigation into what became known as the 'Pretty Windows Murder' in reference to the intricate pattern on the pub's windows. Mr Wilson's widow died in 1997 without knowing the motive for his death, and their daughter Margaret, 56, has now joined police in the hunt for the killer. Speaking ahead of the 50th anniversary of her father's death, she said: 'Whoever did this robbed us of our dad. 'We would really like to know for our own peace of mind, even if the offender is dead.' She said her family realised later that her father was wearing a suit on the night of his death, as if he had been planning to go somewhere or meet someone. Mr Wilson, pictured here on his wedding day with wife Alberta, was killed near the Fox & Grapes pub he ran . She added: 'We think that quite a lot of local people will have known something about Dad’s death., as everyone knew each other’s business back then. 'We are also pretty sure that Blackie would have attacked whoever attacked Dad; he was very protective of him. 'Our mother died in 1997, without ever knowing who did this or why.  No motive has ever been established.' Two months before the murder, Mr Wilson received an anonymous death threat, but police couldn't identify anyone with a grudge against him. Pieces of broken slate from a nearby low roof suggested that the killer had jumped down before the attack and five people even confessed to the killing. But not one of them could describe the murder weapon or identify the victim from pictures. Happy couple ripped apart: Mr Wilson's widow died in 1997 without having discovered who killed her husband . One of those who confessed was a Dartmoor prisoner who said he got into an argument with George when the landlord made a few jokes at the expense of Nottingham Forest in their game that day with Wolverhampton Wanderers. One witness described a man running down Longden Street at 12.50am wearing a green Robin Hood style hat, a light-coloured raincoat and appeared to have a knife or chisel in his hand. But the trail went cold after that discovery, despite the biggest manhunt in Nottinghamshire Police’s history. Today police relaunched the case and released a picture of former miner Mr and Mrs Wilson on their wedding day. DCI Tony Heydon said: 'Over the years we have had people calling in with information in relation to George’s murder, but we are still keen to hear from anyone who hasn’t come forward before. 'Those who have previously spoken to the police if they wish to corroborate their accounts or anyone out there who has information which they may previously have thought to be of little relevance is also asked to contact us. 'I would also be keen to hear from anyone who was in the local licensing industry in the 60s, other landlords, or even older residents who still live in the area.' He added: 'People do change alliances, and it may be someone you knew many years ago arrived home on 8 September 1963 acting out of character or even gave you information about what had happened. 'We need to hear from you, and I would urge you to contact us.  50 years have passed but for George’s children, Margaret and David, so many questions remain unanswered. 'Cases such as this never close and we remain determined to get justice for George’s family.'","George Wilson, 41, was stabbed outside the Fox and Grapes in Nottingham .

When Michelle Wrenn bought Nata from her former owner, she thought it was a gesture of compassion for an unremarkable animal. She had paid £450 for the beautiful 23-year-old chestnut horse, who could have been sent to the slaughterhouse, after her owner realised Nata was much older than previously thought. Though she thought she had 'seen something special' in the ageing animal, Mrs Wrenn, 54, never thought to look in to her past until her curiosity was stirred by the animal's exceptional grace when being ridden by a friend. Michelle bought Nata, a beautiful 23-year-old chestnut to save her from the slaughterhouse. But she had no idea of her polo-star past. But in fact Nata was still competing very recently - and is pictured here here being ridden by Royston Prisk at the O2 Arena in May this year . But after investigating Nata's pedigree, . Mrs Wrenn was stunned to discover that Nata was one of the world's . greatest polo horses, who moved in the same circles as the Royal Family. Calls to a vet who had formerly cared for Nata revealed that the chestnut mare was once the mount of polo legend Carlos Gracida, a man who was once considered the greatest player in the world. Mr Gracida is also a friend of Prince Charles, and his former coach, who also trained Prince William and Prince Harry. Mrs Wrenn, a mother of two, had been looking for a horse to care for in her rural Devon home, and fell in love with Nata as soon as she saw her. Her former owner had bought Nata under the false impression that she was just 13, and resolved to sell her quickly or - if that wasn't possible - send her to slaughter. Mrs Wrenn said: ‘As soon as a friend told me about Nata I went to see her and I was struck by just how beautiful she was. Nata was also formerly owned by Carlos Gracida (centre) who coached Prince Charles (right), here wearing the number 4 polo shirt . ‘She was facing a very uncertain fate and I didn’t want to see her suffer. I saw something special in her and bought her. ‘Nata . had been passed between dealers and didn’t have a proper home. The last . owner hadn’t done their maths properly and thought she was only 13. ‘When they worked out her true age they simply didn’t want her.’ Mrs Wrenn decided to research Nata’s history when she saw her being ridden by a . family friend and suspected the graceful animal was a thoroughbred. She . said: ‘I had her passport and there was one stamp from an English vet. When I called him and said Nata’s name, he said he would call me back in . 10 minutes. ‘He then phoned and confirmed it was the well-known polo horse.' The association with Prince Charles, left, and Carlos Gracida, right, proves Nata's place on the polo scene . She also discovered that Nata had more recently been owned by socialite Royston Prisk, who had ridden her competitively as recently as this year. She managed to contact Mr Prisk, who was shocked to hear how close the 'extremely special' horse had come to death. Mrs Wrenn also contacted Mr Prisk who was shocked to hear his former mare had come so close to being destroyed. Mr Prisk, from Windsor, Berkshire, said: ‘She is an extremely special horse. We had a great connection and were very much in tune with one another. ‘I had her for around six years and she’s one of the best horses I ever rode. I rode her at the O2 arena this year in the Gaucho International polo event. She was such a reliable horse. ‘She recently suffered from an injury and because of her age, I thought it was best that she retired as I thought it was unfair to keep playing her. ‘It’s great to know that she is being loved and well looked-after by Michelle. It would be great to visit Nata, to meet Michelle and visit her in her new home.’","Michelle Wrenn wanted to give an old horse a home in rural Devon .

U.S. scientists have identified an ‘angry mum’ gene that makes some mothers lash out or shout at their children. The study revealed women who carry a variant of the protein are predisposed to hitting or shouting at children during an economic downturn. Scientists discovered ‘harsh parenting’ increased during the Great Recession in the U.S. between 2007 and 2009, particularly amongst women with the so-called ‘sensitive’ mutation of a gene that regulates moods. A study by New York University revealed women who carry a variant of the protein are predisposed to hitting or shouting at children during an economic downturn . Just over half the parents taking part in the study had the gene known as DRD2 that controls dopamine, a behaviour and mood-regulating chemical in the brain. Dr Dohoon Lee, of New York University, said: 'It’s commonly thought economic hardship within families leads to stress which - in turn - leads to deterioration of parenting quality. 'But these findings show an economic downturn in the larger community can adversely affect parenting - regardless of the conditions individual families face.' The study, published in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said the effect is only found in mothers who carry the gene version that makes them more likely to react to their environment. Deteriorating financial conditions had no effect on the level of harsh parenting of mothers without the sensitive gene. But mothers with it displayed less aggressive parenting when the economy was improving compared with those without it. An economic downturn in the larger community can adversely affect parenting - regardless of the conditions individual families face, according to the research which was based on data from 5,000 children born in 20 large American cities including New York (pictured) between 1998 and 2000 . Professor Irwin Garfinkel, of Columbia . University, said: 'This finding provides further evidence in favour of . the orchid-dandelion hypothesis that humans with sensitive genes - like . orchids - wilt or die in poor environments but flourish in rich . environments whereas dandelions survive in poor and rich environments.' The research was based on data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS) involving almost 5,000 children born in 20 large American cities between 1998 and 2000. Mothers were interviewed shortly after giving birth and when the child was about one, three, five and nine years old. Data on harsh parenting was collected when the child was three, five and nine with saliva DNA samples collected from 2,600 mothers and children on the final occasion. Harsh parenting was measured using ten items from the commonly used Conflict Tactics Scale - five measuring psychological issues such as shouts and threats and the others corporal punishment like spanking or slapping. Harsh parenting was measured using ten items from the commonly used Conflict Tactics Scale - five measuring psychological issues such as shouts and threats and the others corporal punishment like spanking or slapping. The results showed harsh parenting wasn't linked with high levels of unemployment . The researchers also analysed economic conditions in each of the cities where the mothers lived using monthly unemployment rates and consumer surveys. The results showed that contrary to common perceptions, harsh parenting was not linked with high levels of unemployment among those studied. Rather it was connected with increases in a city’s unemployment rate and declines in national consumer confidence. The researchers concluded the fear of losing one's job because of deteriorating economic conditions, is more likely to cause harsh parenting than poor economic conditions or even economic hardship that a family faces. Professor Sara McLanahan, of Princeton University, said: 'People can adjust to difficult circumstances once they know what to expect - whereas fear or uncertainty about the future is more difficult to deal with.' The researchers also sought to determine if the response varied by genetic make-up. Mothers with the ‘sensitive’ DRD2 gene were significantly more likely to engage in harsh parenting under deteriorating local economic conditions and declines in consumer confidence.","U.S. scientists found an economic downturn in the larger .

George Zimmerman's wife is reaping more than $4,000-a-month from his defence fund despite splitting from him four weeks after he was cleared of murdering Trayvon Martin. Shellie Zimmerman filed to legally end her marriage two days after breaking her silence during a television interview where she explained that her self-esteem had been 'beaten down' by her husband and his trial put a strain on their marriage. And today TMZ revealed she is collecting the $4,300 stipend to cover her 'living expenses' even though the couple separated on August 13. Zimmerman had raised some $300,000 to be used for his 'ongoing living expenses, legal costs, and fees for this matter', according to the solicitation on PayPal. Personal strife: Shellie Zimmerman is preparing to file for divorce from her husband George . More confusing still, his legal . defense website says: 'Currently George and Shellie are renting a secure . residence at a reasonable rate.  Their day-to-day living expenses are . relatively modest as they want to preserve as many funds as possible for . an aggressive defense.' It comes as Shellie's lawyer confirmed their split to The Orlando Sentinel on . Thursday and said that while the formal filing is imminent, the couple . separated on August 13- exactly one month after he was acquitted of the . teen's murder. Shellie, . who told the court that she was two months shy of earning her . registered nurse's license before dropping out of school, has no income . and six-figure debts. According to the paper, she has $103,756 in debt due to school and car loans as well as credit card bills. She wants to have a mediator divide up the couple's assets equitably but she hopes to gain custody of their two dogs- a Rottweiller named Oso and a mixed breed named Leroy. Her $12,729 in assets is attributed largely to her Honda Accord. 'After much soul searching and recent disappointments, Shellie feels compelled to officially end her six-year marriage to George Michael Zimmerman,' Kelly Sims said. 'The marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken,' the filing wrote. Her brother-in-law Robert, who frequently made press appearances during the trial, said that Shellie has not yet filed the divorce papers but her legal team confirmed to him that they will be processed soon. Support: Shellie was a fixture at each of George's hearings during his trial for the slaying of Trayvon Martin . Strained relationship: Shellie Zimmerman (right), pictured here with her husband, George, on the opening day of his trial in June, agreed to sit down for a candid interview revealing details of her marriage after the acquittal . 'According to Shellie's atty Kelly . Sims - Shellie is preparing to file 4 divorce. Docs have not yet been . filed in Seminole Cty. Pray 4 them,' Robert Zimmerman wrote on Twitter. Shellie, . 26, spoke to Good Morning America and told how the death threats that . he husband received following Trayvon Martin's slaying came at a cost . for their quality of life, forcing them to live 'pretty much Gypsies for . the past year'. We lived in a 20-foot trailer in the woods, scared every night that someone would find us and it would be horrific,' she said in the interview which aired on August 28. Mrs Zimmerman stood by her husband throughout his lengthy criminal trial that sent them both into hiding when George became a symbol of racial tension. She appeared at every court hearing for him before he was acquitted of second degree murder. Even now, she stands by his actions that night, when the neighborhood watch volunteer confronted a teenager he thought looked suspicious who was walking through his neighborhood. When asked if she thought George had targeted Trayvon and murdered him in cold blood, she he's 'not capable' that kind of behavior. Free: Shellie Zimmerman, wife of George Zimmerman, leaves the courtroom at the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida, on Wednesday, August 28th, 2013 . 'That's not his way,' she said. With the exception of his latest speeding ticket, George Zimmerman's legal worries are currently over. The same is not true for Shellie, however, as she appeared in court in late August to enter a guilty plea to lying under oath. She . admitted that she lied when asked about she and George's financial . situation when he was trying to meet bail after being arrested for the . shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

Despite a lack of demand from the American public for electric cars, the federal government gave a California company more than $100million in taxpayer money to establish a network of car-charging stations that is plagued by multiple problems, a government audit revealed. The company is San Francisco-based ECOtality, which recently named Brandon Hurlbut - one-time chief of staff to former Energy Secretary Steven Chu - to its board of directors. 'I’m a political beast,' ECOtality's then-president, Jonathan Read, said on a . 2007 shareholder conference call. 'Playing the political card is . something that when the time is right we’re going to play very hard.' Unpopular: American consumers have made it fairly clear they don't want electric cars for a variety of reasons . In 2009, it seems the time was right - ECOtality was given a $99.8million federal grant to install roughly 15,000 electric vehicle charging stations throughout the country. The company also received $35 million from the department’s Vehicle Technologies Program from 2005 . to 2011, “for two multiyear projects to evaluate and test specific . vehicles.” All of this comes as President Barack Obama has pledged to get one million electric cars on American roads by 2015 - a lofty goal in a country that has repeatedly shown its disdain for electric vehicles. According to the Inspector General’s report, first obtained by Fox News, 'ECOtality was required to kick in a minimum of 20 percent of cost sharing under the $35 million in grants, and under the $100 million award, it was to match the taxpayer subsidy. But the DOE allowed ECOtality to use monthly costs of car owners and other expenses it did not directly incur to leverage the federal funds. That meant the company took on little risk in return for its subsidies, the report said.' 'Although there is no clear legislative history on the meaning behind requiring recipients to provide cost-share, the concept is generally understood to mitigate risk, help leverage federal investments, and ensure that recipients have some ‘skin in the game’ in these kinds of transactions,' the IG report said. Politics: former ECOtality President John Read 'play[s] politics hard' - and was awarded a $100million federal contract . The company had planned to begin installing charging stations in five metro areas to alleviate one of the biggest issues Americans have with electric cars: 'range anxiety' - the fear amongst consumers that charging electric cars will be too difficult because of a lack of charging stations. The goal, the report says, was to instal so many charging stations that they become as common as gas stations. However, weak demand for electric cars created a weak demand for charging stations, so the company and the DOE opted to spread the stations into five additional cities in order to reach the goal of 15,000 stations. The company also started pushing home chargers - both of which are factors that led the IG to conclude that the new plan undermined the goal of alleviating range anxiety in the initial markets. 'The real problem is the policy approach of the Obama administration,' said Paul Chesser, of the National Legal and Policy Center. 'The department of Energy and, really ECOtality, were in an impossible situation. President Obama says, ''There's going to be 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015, so here are billions to make it happen.'' And then nobody buys the cars. Supply and demand: Government officials agree that there isn't enough demand for electric cars to warrant 15,000 charging stations . 'It's a disastrous domino effect, a complication of a policy that was a bad idea,' Chesser said. The plan calls for all charging stations to collect data from users. But many of the stations were so seldom used that the data they collected was useless in gauging public satisfaction. 'The lack of analysis by the Department or ECOtality prevented us from determining whether the reasoning behind these changes was sound and in the best interest of U.S. taxpayers,' the IG wrote.","'I'm a political beast.' That's what the former president of a company with ties to the White House told shareholders before the federal government gave the company $100million to build a network charging stations for electric cars .

A father has ordered his family to spend a year living like it was 1986 by banning all modern technology after fearing gadgets were spoiling his children. Blair McMillan made the call to carry out his 'social experiment' after his son Trey, five, said he preferred to stay indoors and play games on an iPad rather than go outside on a hot summer day. So Blair, remembering when he was a child and how it was impossible to keep children sitting quietly indoors, decided to go back in time and give his kids a taste of life in the year he was born. Playtime: Blair McMillan is converting sons Denton, left, and Trey, right, to the simple joys of old fashioned fun after banning modern technology . Since April, the McMillans, from Guelph in Ontario, Canada, have given up all modern technology with Blair even growing a mullet. The family have no internet or 24-hour news channels. Instead they have an old 1980's TV set encased in a wooden cabinet and a 'ghetto blaster' cassette player blaring 80's classics. They have thrown out their mobile phones, post real letters instead of sending emails, and knock on people's front doors instead of following them on Facebook. When travelling they use a map to . navigate instead of using a GPS navigation system and use film-based . cameras to capture special moments. Most . of their friends have been supportive of their experiment but Blair, . 26, revealed some simply can't give up technology even when visiting the . 1986 household. Stepping back in time: Blair McMillan has brought his family back to 1986 after shunning all modern technology - including Sat Navs . Blast from the past: Blair McMillan has been getting used to using an outdated 'ghetto blaster' and living without 24-hour news channels, Facebook and emails as he sees if life was better without modern technology . He said: 'It feels weird - it feels . like we have really gone back in time. The strangest thing without . having a cell phone is that I could almost feel my pocket vibrating and . wanted to check my pocket. 'At the same time the experience has brought the family closer and given us an opportunity to talk to each other a lot more. 'I'd like to think I've been touching a lot of lives just through the people that I've met when they see me and the way I look. 'They will stop to take pictures of me and talk to me - they think what we're doing is really cool. 'Some . won't catch on though. I even have a 'cell phone box' inside the front . door of our house and whoever wants to enter has to leave it there for . the duration of their visit.'

The risqué ending caused Whittier Christian High School in La Habra, CA., to be suspended, but has been returned to the classroom after a groundswell of support from students.

Oh my God: A student tells Steve Endemano 'they're huge' after he drops his towel . .Initially removed from the classroom for the skit, which ended with him in a locker room dropping a towel and a student saying ‘oh my God, they’re huge,’ the teacher and coach has been allowed to return for his 35th year at the school. When first introduced, Mr Endemano explained he teaches Bible, calculus and physics, and that he dreamed of being a professional cyclist. ‘I love to ride bikes, I ride bikes all the time, and I would love to be a professional cyclist’ he told Mr Leno, before adding that he’s ‘only 64.’ The talk show host then introduces the faux trailer for ‘Get Some Balls: The Steve Endemano Story.’ 2 and half minutes of fame: Mr Endemano (right) was featured in an 'audience sizzle reels' segment on the 'Tonight Show' with Jay Leno (left) The trailer shows Mr Endemano’s disappointment in disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong admitting having taken performance enhancing drugs in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. ‘Lance!

The school suspended the teacher shortly after skit aired. Students responded by creating a Facebook page demanding he be reinstated, and several students who spoke to local media agreed that while regrettable, the skit should not result in his dismissal. ‘I think he should come back to school, because we miss him as a teacher, and he’s great to have on campus,’ a student told KTLA before Mr Endemano was reinstated.

About 70 undergrads were forced to withdraw from the school when the scandal blew up, while others claimed they simply 'collaborated' on the exam and wanted to sue the university. In a further blow to the university, the latest survey also found that 20 percent of freshman athletes admitted to cheating on an exam, compared with nine percent of other students.

All the locks have had to be changed at four prisons after guards lost the keys, ministers have admitted. The taxpayer picked up the £300,000 bill to prevent mass escapes in the last three years. It can also be revealed that since the coalition was formed prison officers have lost almost 140 sets of keys, used to unlock everything from prison gates to handcuffs used to restrain the most dangerous criminals. Blunder: The taxpayer paid out £79,525 to change the locks at the category B Swaleside jail on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent . Key problem: Warren Hill prison in Hollesley, Suffolk and Glen Parva young offenders institution in Leicester also had to change their locks . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has unveiled plans to shut five jails, including the historic Dartmoor Prison in Devon. He argued it was time to replace old, crumbling prisons with modern super-jails housing thousands of inmates. But the Ministry of Justice this week admitted to the security blunders which meant four of the country’s biggest jails had to be ’relocked’ since 2010. The taxpayer paid out £79,525 to change the locks at the category B Swaleside jail on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. Ridiculous: Labour's Sadiq Khan criticised the errors which saw dozens of sets of keys lost . A further £173,608 was spent on new . locks for the Glen Parva young offenders institution in Leicestershire . and £84,418 on the Warren Hill young offenders institution in Suffolk. All the locks in the 1,450 capacity HMP Birmingham were also replaced at a cost of £415,276, although the bill was picked up by private firm G4S which runs the category B jail. Ministers are at pains to stress that ‘there were no escapes at any of the prisons’ as a result of the security error. ‘Following these incidents vigilance at the prisons was increased regarding key security and events that may lead to a prison needing to be relocked,’ said prisons minister Jeremy Wright. However Labour said it was ‘ridiculous’ that so much money had been spent because prison staff had misplaced their keys. Labour’s shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ’I’ve heard of locking up prisoners and throwing away the keys, but losing the keys is ridiculous. ’This is breathtaking incompetence of the highest order and is money the taxpayer can ill afford to waste.’ Ministers have also admitted that in the first two years of the coalition there were 136 cases of loss of keys reported by prisons. It included officers and guard losing or misplacing keys to prison gates, cells, handcuffs and escort chains. Bill: Private contractor G4S had to spend more than £400,000 changing all of the locks at the 1,450 capacity prison in Birmingham . Andrew Neilson, Director of Campaigns at . the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ‘With budgets dwindling year . on year, the Prison Service can ill–afford spending hundreds of . thousands of pounds on changing the locks in our jails. ‘Prisons are overcrowded, the staff who work there are overstretched, and this is money that could be better spent on alternatives to custody, such as community sentences.’ A Prison Service spokesperson said: ‘Incidents like this are extremely rare.

Legendary illusionist David Copperfield disappeared from many people’s radar over the last few years, but he’s gearing up for a major comeback. He’s just signed on for three more years with a new show at MGM Grand, plus they’ll be naming a theater in his honor. The veteran entertainer also has a string of recent behind-the-scenes movie credits under his belt and a second life in real estate, most notably with the chain of 11 Bahamas islands he’s now turned into an exclusive Caribbean resort. For my next trick: Master illusionist David Copperfield, here with his fiance model Chloe Gosselin, is set to make a comeback.

The Duchess of Cambridge had a 'perfect, natural birth' when she welcomed baby Prince George on July 22nd, the latest issue of Vanity Fair reports. 'She spoke to some of her best girlfriends after the birth and described the birth as perfect,' a source told the October issue of the magazine. 'She said it was straightforward and . there were no complications. She wanted a natural birth and she was so . happy she was able to have one.' A 'perfect, natural birth': The Duchess of Cambridge's July 22nd delivery of baby Prince George was apparently exactly as she had hoped it would be . Looking flawless: Kate apparently had her hair stylist on standby for a month before George's birth . And it would seem that the Duchess mirrored her own mother in that regard. George Brown, who has been a close family friend of the Middletons for the past 31 years, told the U.S. glossy that new grandmother Carole had an 'easy and natural' birth when she delivered her own firstborn. '[It] didn't surprise me,' he said. 'She was fit and competent from the word go. She seemed to take to . motherhood amazingly well, and when I went round to see her, she was . happily breastfeeding and seemed to know exactly what she was doing.

'She decided there was no point trying to hide her bump, so she went for a flattering dress that showed off her curves' The article also sheds light on new . details surrounding the birth, such as Kate's appearance when she . entered the hospital in the early hours of the morning (a dark shawl and . her hairl loose around her shoulders) - and how waiting photographers . decided it would be inappropriate to snap her. The article also reveals that the Duchess's hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker was on standby for the entire month of July.

In accordance with tradition, the royal baby will have six godparents, which are likely to include Kate's sister Pippa and William's brother Prince Harry, the article reports. He will wear a replica of the christening gown worn by Queen Victoria's children as his father and grandmother did, and as the future head of the Church of England, will most likely be christened at Buckingham Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury like his ancestors.","The Duchess's hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker was on standby for the entire month of July, and even brought a selection of dresses - including that Jenny Packham frock -  for the new mother to choose from ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:09 EST, 7 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:22 EST, 7 September 2013 . The relatives of a woman who died mysteriously have aired their suspicions about her husband as they believe that he had something to do with her death. Dr Michael Wohlschlaeger's fifth wife Shirley Seitz died in their Alabama bedroom following days of unexplained pain and now her relatives are still waiting for justice. He has never been charged with any crimes in connection to her death and maintains that he is innocent, but her relatives painted a far more sinister picture of the four-year marriage that ended with Seitz unconscious, face down on their bedroom floor. Her relatives told 20/20 . that since Seitz's death in 2010, her relatives have discovered that . 'he soaked her dry' both before and after she died- cashing in on a . $100,000 life insurrance policy and having her use her $500,000 in . liquid assets that she had going into the marriage to buy their home and . bankroll their life together. Marriage number five: Shirley Seitz and Michael Wohlschlaeger met each other just three months before they got married in 2006, and the union was the fifth marriage for both. Four years later, she was dead. Seitz's daughter Sharon Yeomans said . that they were wary of Wohlschlaeger's financial footing even before her . mother decided to marry him. Murky career: In the early 1990s, Dr Wohlschlaeger was found guilty of arson when he set his chiropractor's office on fire . 'He came into the marriage with the clothes on his back. And he's a doctor?' Mrs Yeomans told ABC. Her relatives were hesitant when Seitz rushed into her marriage with Wohlschlaeger in 2006 after just a three month courtship. Adding to that, she had her own share of relationship issues in the past, as this was also her fifth marriage. Her fourth husband Gene Seitz had left her $1million following his death, and while she never told her relatives that she felt used during her four year marriage to Wohlschlaeger, they found out after her death. When Mrs Yeomans was looking for answers- searching her mother's house in Loxley, Alabama for her original will- she stumbled upon her mother's personal journals. 'How much longer am I going to have to financially support this man? He said he wasn't going to do this to me. He said he was going to get a job. He's constantly spending my money. Lord when is he going to get a job?' Seitz wrote in one entry, according to her daughter. The 20/20 investigation proved that his apparent money problems started much earlier, before his marriage to Seitz. A former police officer told ABC that in the early 1990s, he saw smoke coming from Wohlschlaeger's medical office in Chipley, Florida. Rather than calling police to report an . alleged crime- as he claimed that someone attacked him inside his office . and set the place on fire during the altercation- the officer saw . Wohlschlaeger just standing across the street watching the fire. Caring: Seitz, who had inherited $1million when her fourth husband died, was an evangelist and a 'giver' The women that came before: His first wife (Lynn) died from choking on a cough drop, his second (Paula) got a divorce after three years; Gloria said he hit her with a mallet while she was sleeping. His fourth (Diana) said she thought he was poisoning her . Wohlschlaeger also smelled of diesel fuel, which was later discovered to be the cause of the fire. Wohlschlaeger was charged with arson and put on 15 years probation, in addition to having his license revoked. After the guilty verdict was handed down, he allegedly threatened the officer. Now, two of his other ex wives say that he also showed violent behavior during their marriages- facts that they did not disclose during the investigation into Seitz's death. His third wife, Gloria Potts, was married to him from 1981 to 1995. When contacted by Seitz's daughter, she said that he once hit her with a mallet in the back of her head and then tried to smother her in their bed. Potts said that she was hospitalized after the incident and told doctors that she fell in the shower. Scary: Wohlschlaeger's third wife Gloria Potts told ABC that even though he attacked her in her sleep one night- which he said was a side effect of being stung by jellyfish in China- she stayed married to him for another decade before getting divorced . Different stories: Wohlschlaeger had previously told Seitz's family that he was holding his first wife Lynn's (pictured) hand when she died of leukemia. They later found out she died from choking on a throat losange . When she later asked what he was doing, Potts said that he gave an unbelievable reason: ‘He told me he had gotten stung by jellyfish when he was in China and that it was a reaction to the toxins.’ She did not leave him until a decade later- a move that she cannot rationally explain now, but when she did finally divorce him, she told police about the mallet incident and now has a restraining order against him. Wohlschlaeger's fourth wife, Diana Yohn, was the woman he divorced just months before marrying Seitz. She told police that while she did not have firm proof, she felt that her regular migranes got significantly worse during her marriage to Wohlschlaeger and she felt he played a role in her pain. 'I think that the man's dangerous, personally,' she told police. 'I get migraine headaches, okay? And it's documented that I do. But they were so bad when I lived with him, I, I couldn't even work, I could hardly function. 'And I'll be honest with you...if something happens to me, he needs to be investigated.' Mrs Yohn's complaint resonated even more strongly with Seitz's relatives because they were the same symptoms she complained of before her death. During the investigation, Wohlschlaeger told police that in the days leading up to her death, Seitz had been feeling ill and having one of her bi-annual bouts of migranes. Odd symptoms: In the days leading up to her death, Shirley Seitz had been suffering from severe migraines. Her autopsy reported she had multiple blunt force head injuries . Suspicions: Shirley's daughter Sharon Yeoman suspects that Wohlschlaeger killed her mother- and that he was having an affair with his current (sixth) wife at the time of Seitz's death . Her mother and brother made a surprise visit to the home that Seitz and Wohlschlaeger shared in Loxley to check in on her. They said that she felt so ill that she could not even get out of bed to greet them. When they arrived, Wohlschlaeger said that he had been out of town but when he got back he saw that a potted plant had been broken and he believed Seitz had possibly fallen down the stairs. She denied falling down the stairs. Seitz’s symptoms had improved by the time she said goodnight to her relatives on Sunday February 28, 2010. The next morning, they awoke to Wohlschlaeger screaming that his wife was unconscious. Wohlschlaeger had been sleeping on the couch, and on that Monday morning he said he went into the bedroom and found his wife lying on the floor, unconscious, and her lips were already blue when he saw her. This was not his first wife who died under unusual circumstances either. Throughout his marriage to Seitz, he had told her and her relatives that his first wife, Lynn, died of leukemia. He added that he was holding her hand when she succumbed to the cancer. Out and about: Wohlschlaeger now lives with his sixth wife Maggie in Pensacola, Florida and has never been charged in connection to Seitz's death, but the case has now been reopened . Following her mother’s death, Mrs Yeoman found an old newspaper clipping that reported that Lynn Mary Wohlschlaeger died after choking on a cough drop at the age of 25. The cause of death for Seitz was not as clear, however, as an autopsy listed the cause of death was inconclusive but that she had a series of blunt force head injuries. ‘Man, I hate to say this, but I think someone murdered my sister,’ Seitz’s brother Chester told 20/20. The Alabama Attorney General has now reopened the investigation into Seitz’s death, though the former chiropractor no longer lives in the state. Wohlschlaeger now lives in Pensacola, Florida with his sixth wife, Maggie- the woman who Mrs Yeoman now believes Wohlschlaeger was having an affair with at the end of his marriage to her mother. ‘There’s no question in my mind that Michael killed this woman,’ his third wife Gloria Potts told ABC. ‘Michael killed Shirley.’","Shirley Seitz died in 2010 after being married to her husband for four years .

Mary 'Shelley' Goldsmith has become the next victim in a string of East Coast deaths linked to the club drug molly . Another promising young student’s death has now been linked to the club drug called molly, this time in Washington, DC. University of Virginia sophomore Mary ‘Shelley’ Goldsmith, 19, died August 31 at one of the largest dance clubs in the nation’s capital and her family has now come forward to announce she likely overdosed. Her death is among four that have been blamed on the drug in East Coast cities in the last several weeks and authorities are investigating whether a single bad batch is to blame for the tragic string of deaths. Toxicology results have yet to come . back for Goldsmith, or any of the victims, but an anonymous DC police . source told the Washington Post that ‘Goldsmith’s friends told . detectives that she had taken Molly at the club early Saturday.’ As . authorities wait to determine if a single batch is to blame for the . deaths that now stretch from Boston to Washington, Goldsmith’s father . chose to come forward in hopes of preventing more deaths. Robert . G. Goldsmith told the Washington Post that he and his family briefly . weighed whether or not to come forward about their daughter’s death . after her friends admitted she’d used molly at Echo Stage in Northeast . Washington. Tragic: Goldsmith was a sophomore at prestigious University of Virginia, where she was awarded the highest merit scholarship. Her father has now come forward to say her August 31 death was caused by molly . ‘If her death can open someone’s eyes, then we need to talk about it,’ Goldsmith said. ‘Shelley deserves a legacy of being someone who cared for people, someone who achieved, someone who contributed, and not a druggie who died,’ he said. ‘That’s not who she was.’ Goldsmith hailed from Abingdon, Virginia and was admitted to her prestigious university with the highest possible merit scholarship. She hoped to one day have a career in politics and had the resume full distinctions to help her on her way. Goldsmith was rushed to Providence Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 3am Sunday. Her father told the AP she had some sort of ‘heart and pulmonary’ attack. Linked? Authorities are now awaiting toxicology results to determine if Goldsmith's death is linked to similar overdoses in New York and Boston . 'Her love of life was contagious,' reads Goldsmith's obituary. 'She volunteered at the food bank, worked for Democratic candidates, decorated cupcakes with her friends' Managers of the 30,000 square foot Echo Stage said in a statement that they are saddened to hear about her death and that they will cooperate in the ongoing investigation. The same Saturday as Goldsmith, at the Electric Zoo . music festival in New York City, two young people died after taking . molly and four other party-goers were sickened. The deaths of Olivia Rotondo, 20, and Jeffrey Russ, 23, have both been linked to the pure form of ecstasy. Rotondo . reportedly suffered a seizure as she collapsed in front of paramedics . before telling them, 'I just took six hits of molly.' The . festival was scheduled to last through Sunday, but its third day of . trance music and dancing was cancelled in light of the tragedies. Rotondo, a Providence, Rhode Island native, died at the hospital Saturday night. Police . believe all six Electric Zoo attendees either overdosed or took tainted doses of the . party drug Molly - a potent powder form of MDMA, aka Ecstasy. 'I just took six hits of Molly': 20-year-old Olivia Rotondo (right) died Saturday after suffering a seizure in front of paramedics at the Electric Zoo music festival in New York City . Tragic: Rotondo was one of two attendees of New York City's Electric Zoo music festival who died Saturday from overdoses of Molly . Another victim: 23-year-old Jeffrey Russ of Rochester, New York also died Saturday due to an apparent Molly overdose . Tragedy at dance festival: Olivia Rotondo, 20, from Providence, Rhode Island passed away after attending Electric Zoo shortly after Jeffrey Russ from Rochester, NY . 'Just get me to the damn zoo,' Rotondo tweeted hours before her death . In the aftermath of two deaths at New York City's Electric Zoo and and at least three overdoses in Massachusetts, DEA officials say the drug known as Molly, MDMA, or Ecstacy is a top priority. 'There’s no ‘good batch’ of molly,' Anthony Pettigrew, a spokesman for the DEA New England division, told the Boston Herald. 'This is stuff that’s made in somebody’s bathtub in either Asia, the Netherlands, Canada, you have no idea what is in this stuff. Dealers want to make more money, so they’ll mix and adulterate the stuff with meth and any number of other drugs to addict people to it.' An official with the New York arm of the Drug Enforcement Agency concurred. 'We are seeing (molly) goes hand-in-hand with a lot of nightclub activity, concert venues, areas where there’s a lot of teens listening to music,' said Erin Mulvey. 'With these overdose deaths and the focus now with trying to get the awareness out, we’re trying to get in front of the problem.' More dangerous? Molly has been known for years as MDMA or Ecstasy, but some say its powder form is more dangerous because it is easily adulterated when put inside capsules . Last Tuesday, 19-year-old Brittany Flannigan died in Boston after taking the drug Molly. OLD DRUG, NEW TRICKS? Molly is a crystalline or powder form of the well-known club drug Ecstasy. However, some believe Molly--which can be snorted or swallowed in a capsule--is more likely than the drug in tablet form to be laced with anything from caffeine to methamphetamine. The moniker 'Molly' could also refer to the chemical MDMA (ecstasy) or to a variety of similar and related chemicals. The drug is popular at music and dance venues because of its ability to energize its user. Users also report a sense of heightened empathy and of a heightened ability to 'feel' the music. It is nearly impossible for a user to judge exactly how much Molly they can safely take because there is no set measure of potency and it is often impossible to tell if a dose has been adulterated. Friends and family of the two . festival-goers who died have now endured callous attacks by ravers who are furious . the organizers canceled the final day of the music festival over the . deaths. Music fans have . called the deceased 'irresponsible idiots' and said that concert . promoters should not have 'punished' surviving fans because of the . 'irresponsibility' of the two victims. City officials urged organizer Made . Event to cancel the final day of Electric Zoo to prevent any . additional overdoses. On Sunday morning, they complied and told fans . that they would receive a full refund for the last day of the festival. That didn't satisfy some, who took their anger out of Russ and Rotondo - blaming them for the cancellation. Facebook . use Ben Spanbock posted an angry rant on Electric Zoo's Facebook page: . 'I really don't understand how two people could be so stupid,' he wrote. 'Yes . it's sad that they died, but you literally couldn't turn around in that . place without seeing a help station or a water refill. And because two . yokels couldn't control themselves, the other tens of thousands pay the . price. Ridiculous.' Jeffrey Glowka fumed: 'I'm not worried about two idiots who did this to themselves.' Fury: Many Electric Zoo fans had little or no sympathy for the two festival-goers who died . Shutdown: Electric Zoo Electronic Music festival on Randall's Island, NYC was shut down today after suspected drug deaths . Many people say they shouldn't be 'punished' for the deaths of the two fans . Name-calling: One Facebook user said the overdose victims were 'stupid' 'If . you cared about your patrons then you wouldn’t disappoint the tens of . thousand RESPONSIBLE concert goers who LIVE for the music at these . festivals. While my deepest condolences go out to the families of the . lives that were lost yesterday, it does not mean that everyone else . needs to suffer,' an angry David Eli wrote. Dozens of people wrote comments blasting Russ and Rotondo - and hundreds of people 'liked' them. Despite . the callous words from some attendees, most people who wrote on the . Electric Zoo Facebook page praised organizers for canceled the final day . of the event and expressed sympathy for the families of Russ and . Rotondo. This marks the . second time in a week that Molly has made headlines and led to canceled . shows.

But Romeo and Juliet may not be as well-matched as previously thought -if modern dating standards are anything to do by. Match-making experts have analysed the psychological profiles of the Shakespearean duo and concluded that their love might not have been worth dying for after all. Researchers subjected their personalities to the same analysis used to match modern-day couples. They said the fictional lovers were poorly suited and added that Juliet would actually be better suited to Mr Darcy, the hero of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. Literary lovers: Juliet (as portrayed by Claire Danies in Baz Luhrmann's Rome and Juliet) is better suited to Mr Darcy (as portrayed by Colin Firth) Meanwhile, they said Romeo would have done much better with a girl like Bella Swan, played by Kristen Stewart in the Twilight films. The pair were two of the 60 fictional characters studied by experts at the dating website eHarmony, which helps lonely hearts to meet like-minded potential partners. The website uses an algorithm to match people with each other based on details they have uploaded onto their profile. Each character was scored on key personality dimensions needed for a successful relationship, including emotional temperament, social style and relationship skills. A spokesman said: ‘Romeo and Juliet wouldn’t have lasted too long as a couple. He is far too superficial for her in terms of the way he judges his partners and Romeo wouldn’t have understood Juliet’s needs or sympathised with her after the initial spark wore off. ‘Importantly, neither can depend on the people around them which would have a knock-on effect in terms of how they would trust each other in the long term.’ They added that Romeo and Bella Swan would be better suited because they both display neurotic characteristics. Romeo's ideal lover would be Bella from Twilight . Sensitive and dependable Mr Darcy would make a great match for Juliet because both are conscientious and appreciate regularity in their lives. Characters from Superman, Pride And Prejudice, EastEnders, Coronation Street, Star Wars and Twilight were included in the study. Of those examined, the couple with the highest compatibility were Coronation Street legends Jack and Vera Duckworth. Sorry Mary Jane: Spiderman should date Princess Leia from Star Wars . Experts found the two had similar social styles, with loud-mouthed Vera and wise-cracking Jack working well as a pair. Researchers also found high compatibility between people from different fictional couples.The most compatible was Superman’s Clark Kent had and Jane Eyre, the heroine of Charlotte Bronte’s classic novel. Researchers said they both wanted to spend lots of time with their other half and regularly showed their partner how much they mean to them. Jack Dawson from the film Titanic also had a high compatibility with Carrie Bradshaw from the hit TV show Sex in the City - mainly because of their mutual desire for physical attractiveness. Other top matches were Peter Parker from Spiderman and Princess Leia from Star Wars, due to their willingness to help others. Brooding Jane Eyre hero Mr Rochester and Bella Swan from Twilight were found to be a good pair because they are both introverted and anxious. And church-going Harold Bishop from soap opera Neighbours was a good match for Belle in the fairytale Beauty and the Beast because they both exhibit kindness in their relationship. Dr Steve Carter, eHarmony’s vice president of matching, said: ‘As experts in relationship compatibility, we were fascinated to see what would happen if we applied eHarmony’s science to fiction’s most beloved characters. ‘The findings show that, while on paper some couples seem well suited, when judging using the elements that really make a relationship work you get some truly intriguing pairings.’","Literary lovers assessed for compatibility by relationship experts .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:49 EST, 6 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:03 EST, 6 September 2013 . In what local police have described as a 'pretty horrific scene,' a Florida man - who was arrested on domestic battery charges less than a month ago - is suspected of fatally stabbing his girlfriend and her 9-month-old son multiple times before turning the knife on himself. Authorities in Hernando Oaks, a relatively safe golf community about 60 miles north of Tampa, say 28-year-old Jamil Etayem stabbed his 23-year-old girlfriend, Roseanna Sanson, and her infant son, Carter, in what appears to be a gruesome double-murder suicide. 'It was a pretty horrific scene,' Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis told reporters on Friday. 'It was shocking even . to hardened law enforcement officers, and even our dispatchers are . having a little bit of a difficult time with it. Fortunately, we don't . see this very often.' Killer: Authorities say Jamil Etayem fatally stabbed his girlfriend and her infant son before turning the knife on himself . Deputies were called to the home the couple was renting inside the gated community about 10 p.m. Thursday after a neighbor who'd heard the couple arguing in the afternoon noticed the house had gone silent and there were no lights on. 'Unfortunately when we got here we found all three of the individuals, . including the 9-month-old little boy, deceased,' Nienhuis said. The couple had just moved to Florida from Ohio in July. Deputies had been called to the home for domestic violence incidents twice since they'd moved in. Authorities said that the only weapon used was a knife - or knives - and that it appears Etayem killed Sanson and then the baby, who had a different biological father. When deputies arrived on the scene, the garage door was open and it appeared that the car was in the process of being packed - perhaps suggesting that Sanson was planning on leaving. Etayem first found himself on the Sheriff's Office's radar on August 20, when deputies responded to the home the couple shared after receiving several calls of an 'irrational subject' at the home who was threatening to harm himself. On August 24, Etayem was booked into jail on domestic battery charges. He was bailed out by a family member the next day. According to Hernando Today, Etayem's bond was set at a mere $500. Conditions of his release included staying away from Sanson. Sheriff Niehuis maintains that his deputies 'followed protocol' in regard to Estayem's August arrest. 'This really illustrates as much information is out there about domestic . violence we can't stress enough to those victims to seek out help,' Nienhuis said. 'No one wants to move out of a house, especially if young . children are involved, but your life may depend on it.' Following Etayem's August 20 arrest, Sanson wrote a statement for sheriff's deputies claiming that on August 19, Etayem kicked her and her son out of the house in the middle of the night. According to her statement, Etayem drove Sanson and her son to homeless shelters and then to the police station . Sanson claims that the next morning, Etayem threatened to kill himself when she told him she planned to move back to Ohio. Additionally, the report claims that Etayem threatened to kill himself and Sanson's baby with a knife. Etayem's court date for the previous domestic battery charge was scheduled for Tuesday.","28-year-old Jamil Etayem threatened to stab himself and his girlfriend's 9-month-old son just last month .

Falling birth rate levels in the U.S. have finally leveled off after plummeting for the past four years, a government report reveals. The number of babies born last year, just less than 4 million, is only a few hundred less than the number in 2011, the report released on Friday shows. This suggests fewer couples are scared away from having children because of the economy or other factors, some experts say. Rates: Following four years of decline, the number of birth rates in the U.S. have begun to level out . One, Brady Hamilton, a statistician with the Centers for Disease Control and . Prevention, said: 'We may be on level course or . potentially even see a rise in birth trends in the near future.' But some remain pessimistic. Carol Hogue, an Emory University expert on birth trends said: 'The decline has slowed down, but it's still a decline.' The report also showed that the birth rate for women in their early 30s has also increased for the first time since 2007. Births were on the rise since the late 1990s and hit an all-time high of more than 4.3 million in 2007. The drop that followed was widely attributed to the nation's flagging economy. Experts believed that many women or couples who were out of work or had other money problems felt they couldn't afford to start or add to their family. Fall: The number of women in their 20s giving birth fell to the lowest rate since 1940 (stock image) The economy was officially in a . recession from December 2007 until June 2009, but polls showed most . Americans remained gloomy, citing anemic hiring, a depressed housing . market and other factors well into 2011. The new Centers for Disease Control and . Prevention report provides a first look at the 2012 birth certificate . data from state health departments. Highlights of the report include: . New born: Experts say that a renewed confidence in the economy could be a reason behind the findings (stock image) Experts attribute the decline in teen births to a range of factors, including less sex and more use of contraception. Bill . Albert of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned . Pregnancy, said the fact that teen birth rates had been cut in half . since 1991 was a 'stunning turnaround.' The report also revealed that about . 33 per cent of births last year were delivered through Cesarean section - . a rate unchanged from the previous two years. Although . C-sections are sometimes medically necessary, some health officials . believe many are done out of convenience or unwarranted caution. In the 1980s, a goal of keeping the national rate at 15 per cent was set. However, the C-section rate had been rising steadily since 1996, until it dropped slightly in 2010. Experts say that even if the C-section rate has peaked, it's still too high - particularly in certain states. For example, last year 40 per cent of births were C-sections in Louisiana, and more than 38 percent in New Jersey, Mississippi and Florida, the report found.","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows number of babies born in U.S. in 2012 was just under 4 million .

The Georgia woman is also charged with stealing more than $10,500 in funds from  Boggs Mountain Humane Shelter, which was closed last year after a TV exposé. Fraudulent: Lowanda 'Peanut' Kilby was charged on Wednesday with 60 felony counts including theft by taking, theft by deception, computer theft and racketeering after falsely promising 28 pet owners their animals wouldn't be killed . Kilby was free on $100,000 bond yesterday following the Rabun County grand jury indictment. Euthanizing animals isn't a crime in Georgia, so none of the counts relate to animal cruelty in the shelter's Lucky Dog-Lucky Kitty program, according to NBC News. Kilby and Penny Burkitt, the shelter's . executive director, resigned in August 2012 after WAGA-TV exposed the . shelter's dodgy dealings. Authorities spent 14 months thoroughly investigating the not-for-profit center. According to the shelter's website, Kilby had been the center's director for four years before she was dismissed. 'Almost everyone in Rabun County knows Peanut and her family,' the website says about Kilby. 'She is personable, professional and a true animal lover.

The indictment also alleges that Kilby unlawfully acquired $3,035 worth of . Boggs Mountain property through racketeering, and took more than $10,000 that was intended for animal adoptions. Kilby or workers at the shelter also reportedly assured pet owners through hand-written notes and emails that their pets would be adopted when they were already dead, Huffington Post reported. 'We do feel awful for all the dogs that were euthanized when people were . told the dogs were adopted, and especially for people who received . emails after the dogs had been euthanized saying that their dogs had . been adopted,' Assistant District Attorney Maggie Hastings said.

A third porn star has reportedly tested positive for HIV, adding more concern that an outbreak is underway among adult entertainment performers. Two other performers- Cameron Bay and Rod Daily- have come forward and announced that they tested positive, but the third infectee has not revealed their name. Radar Online reports that 'a dozen female performers have been quarantined as a result of exposure' as a result of the third case. The latest case is renewing concerns over the health of porn stars as a result of the growing number who have confirmed sexually transmitted diseases. Scroll down for video . Diagnosed: Rod Daily, 32, announced via Twitter that he was recently diagnosed with HIV . After Cameron Bay came out as being . infected, a brief moratorium was issued that stopped all productions of . pornographic films, but that was lifted just days later. When . Rod Daily announced via Twitter that he had tested positive for HIV . less than two weeks after Bay made her announcement, he advocated for . further precautions to be taken. 'Drumroll . please!! I'm 32 years old and I'm HIV positive. Acute HIV, which means I . recently was infected. For that I am blessed,' Daily wrote on Twitter . on Tuesday. 'I'm blessed for the fact that I caught it so early that I can blast that s*** with meds. 'With the tests I have done the doctors have figured out that I was infected within the last month...My antibodies just showed up on a test this week which is scary because they didn't a week ago,' he said in two other tweets. A trade group representing producers of pornographic movies in Los Angeles called on any of Daily's sexual partners to be tested for the virus. However, the group, the Free Speech Coalition, stepped short of calling for a moratorium on adult film productions. Positive attitude: Daily, who has been in the adult film industry for eight years, said that hopefully this will encourage porn stars to wear condoms . Out in the open: Daily announced his positive diagnosis on Twitter Tuesday . The group said it could not yet confirm whether Daily truly had contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, but it warned his partners to be tested. The Free Speech Coalition were the ones to confirm on August 22 that the actress who goes by the name of Cameron Bay was also infected with HIV. Daily has been linked romantically to Bay on the adult film industry website XBiz.com. California Assemblyman Isadore Hall, who has been trying for months to get a bill passed in the state Assembly mandating the use of condoms in sex scenes, said Daily's reported infection shows the need for such a regulation. 'This is the second individual within a week and a half to contract HIV in the industry,' said Hall, a Democrat. 'There will probably be more.' The multibillion-dollar adult film industry is centered in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. Distraught: Cameron Bay's agent says his client, whose recent HIV diagnosis has brought the porn industry to a standstill, is 'distraught' over the news . Risk: Xander Corvus, left, who played Weiner in . the movie with Sydney Leathers, had unprotected sex with Cameron Bay, . right, a few weeks ago - who has just been told she has HIV . Debut: Sydney Leathers porn movie was released yesterday where she stars alongside Xander Corvus . The industry has vigorously opposed . efforts to require condom use on set, protesting against a 2012 . voter-approved measure requiring condoms to be used in Los Angeles . County and successfully arguing against an earlier effort for such . regulation at the state level that would be specifically geared to film . productions. The Free Speech . Coalition said in an email to Reuters that Daily acted in gay and . transsexual sex movies in which condoms were used. After Bay tested positive, production was shut down for about a week. Medical signs: Daily said that the test suggests he contracted HIV in the past month . But as of early evening on Tuesday, no order to cease shooting sex scenes had been issued. In . a series of Twitter postings, Daily cited this brief moratorium as an . example of how the industry is unwilling to change- to the detriment of . it's actors. 'That does not change anything though. A week later people are back at it shooting without condoms. 'I have also learned that people can be so well medicated that they test negative. Scary, the test everyone relies on. 'Magic Johnson has HIV, and can infect other people but his test comes up negative. Is that so impossible for anyone else to do the same? NO. 'Just sayin be careful because that test ain't shit without a condom strapped up with it.' Daily appears to be taking a positive approach to the news, staying optimistic by saying: 'Had to pinch myself a few times no doubt. But the sun still shines on my face and its warm. Can't take my heart ever. I love life, blessed.' 'I felt bad for the guy who had to read me my first test result. His face turned to stone, I wanted to give him a hug and say it will be ok.' Bay's scare resonated outside of the porn industry, as it was revealed that she had recently had sex with the male performer who later appeared in a video starring Sydney Leathers, disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner's sexting partner.","Porn star Rod Daily told his Twitter followers that he has tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS .

A teacher who is thought to suffer from a rare amnesia disorder has been found safe, but with no recollection of what happened. Hannah Upp, 28, a Montgomery County teaching assistant was found after she was recognised by a colleague a few miles away from her school and her personal belongings were found on a footpath nearby. She went missing on Tuesday - the second time in five years - after failing to turn up at Maryland-area Montessori school where she began a job as a teacher's assistant last week. The Facebook page Friends Holding Hannah Upp, launched after her disappearance, confirmed: 'HANNAH IS BACK SAFE. We don't know details, but we know that she is home and safe Hannah and her family are tremendously grateful for your thoughts and prayers.' Ms Upp also went missing in 2008 - she went for a jog near her apartment, and three weeks later, was found by a ferry crew floating in the Hudson River. 'I went from going for a run to being in the ambulance,' Upp told The New York Times in an interview later that year. 'It was like 10 minutes had passed. But it was almost three weeks.' Experts have suggested Upp may suffer from an amnesiac disorder known as Dissociative Fugue. This illness, which is considered extremely rare, means that a patients’ memory loss is characterized by a sudden bout of amnesia.

A person suffering from the condition can unexpectedly travels far from home or work and leaves behind a past life. They usually show signs of amnesia and do not understand or know why they have fled. The condition is usually associated with severe stress or trauma. Because a suffered can not recall all or parts of their life, they can become confused. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) classifies disassociative fugue as one of four dissociative disorders,Source: Mind disorders . Dr. Daniel Schacter, a professor of psychology at Harvard University who has researched dissociative fugue cases told Yahoo Shine. 'Almost by definition, patients in a dissociative fugue state are not aware of who they are, so you have to wait until they come out of that state of amnesia before looking at their experience and what happened.' But some people are sceptical about the disorder. 'I've never seen it,' Dr. Antonia Baum, a psychiatrist in the Montgomery County town of Somerset told WUSA9. 'I've been in practice a good long while. It is that uncommon.' 'When you start to see a pattern like that, you really start to wonder, 'OK, what's going on with this person?' said Dr Baum. 'I would be looking for things with a cyclical tendency.

Once a size 22, the singer is now a svelte size ten – and almost unrecognisable. But while many dieters would be deeply envious of her weight loss, Miss Moyet herself thinks she has gone too far. Alison has dropped from a size 22 (left) to a tiny size 10 (right) over the last four years, but says she is now actively trying to re gain weight as she feels she has lost too much . The 51-year-old said: ‘Personally I . think women look better with a bit of chub on them. I’ve lost too much . weight and I’m working on getting fatter again.’ Usually reluctant to discuss her size for fear of betraying the . ‘sisterhood’, in a new interview she opened up about her concentrated . attempt to lose weight four years ago. ‘It was a mixture of health . reasons and not wanting to be looked after by the patronising thin,’ she . said. She added: ‘It’s funny as my whole character has been based upon not . getting approval elsewhere. And I don’t like the kind of approval that . goes with weight loss. ‘Still, in my 50s where my next significant event is being a . grandmother, I have to worry about my scraggy a***.’ Miss Moyet first . found fame in the 1980s as one half of the electropop duo Yazoo. She went on to launch a successful solo career, selling more than 25million records. When Alison performed When I Was Your Girl, the first single from her 8th solo album on This Morning on the 8th May 2013 (right), she was half the woman she was when she was an eighties pop icon (left) Alison showed off her slender body at the Cornbury Festival in July last year, after deciding to lose weight four years ago . Alison, pictured here performing at Glastonbury festival, has always been known for her alternative style and image . But success came with its own set of problems. The singer has previously . spoken about how she grew up feeling ugly and isolated, often suffering . cruel slights for her appearance. She once said: ‘By the time I was a . teenager I was so absolutely convinced of my Elephant Man distortedness . that I went all out to be as physically unattractive as I could as an . act of defiance.’ These issues were exacerbated by fame. For almost a decade, Miss Moyet . was a virtual prisoner in her own home, crippled by depression and . agoraphobia. At the same time her weight ballooned. Miss Moyet, now a . mother of three, said her children saved her. She explained: ‘Becoming . famous is a really shocking thing, especially when you don’t have . aspirations to it. When she was in Yazoo, Alison's larger frame was as much an integral part of her public image as her shaggy hair and deep soulful voice . Alison's new album 'The Minutes' is her eighth in a amazing career that has seen her sell over 25 million records . ‘It got to the point where I would try and avoid making eye contact with anyone. It was freaky and it just happened overnight. ‘In a lot of respects having kids has saved me from myself. If you’ve . got a child and the child wants to get up, then you have to get up. ‘There is also something to be said of being tired of just having a particular pathology. I just got tired of being depressed.’ Last month Miss Moyet, who is married to teaching assistant David . Ballard, sang at the wedding of her best friend, Dawn French. In the . interview, with the Mirror, she described how she sympathised with the . ‘loving and generous’ comedian because of the attention she attracted . with her own battles with weight.

The London Ambulance Service has a register of 226 addresses where staff are believed to be at risk of physical violence while the North East has a list of 236 properties. Greater Manchester Ambulance service confirmed it had a similar register - although it couldn't confirm numbers - and West Midlands said there were some cases where police back-up would be sent. Blacklist: The London Ambulance Service has a register of 226 addresses where staff are believed to be at risk of physical violence while the North East has a list of 236 properties . Campaigners said the inhabitants only had themselves to blame if their health deteriorated while ambulances waited outside. But there are concerns that children and other innocent patients living at the addresses who needed urgent medical help could be put at risk. John Lister, of London Health Emergency, which campaigns against hospital closure and for improved NHS care said: 'I don't think it's fair for people to abuse ambulance workers. 'If there is a record of that I don't see any reason not to take it seriously. 'There is a risk that patient's care is being affected by the people in the building, but then why should we expect ambulance staff to put themselves at risk? Patients are advised to wait outside the house of a blacklisted house . 'If there are 200 addresses in London then it doesn't sound like it is a widespread problem. 'The ambulance staff take a lot of chances for us generally and I don't see any reason not to believe them if they say there is a problem.' Figures obtained from a Freedom of Information request showed that London Ambulance Service have 226 addresses on their 'at risk' register of which 32 are in Leytonstone, East London. The North East Ambulance Service has previously said it has 236 homes on a similar list where ambulances will not attend without police back-up. Athar Khan, operations manager at the London Ambulance Service , said: 'It alerts the staff before they get to the address of the risk factors and actions they might need to take. 'We take things into consideration. The address, the name of the individual and the physical location. 'The diagnosis given in terms of illness and the access to that property whether we can get in quickly and get out quickly.' Figures show that around 163 staff across the NHS are attacked by patients or relatives every day. There are now around 60,000 assaults a day, a three per cent increase on the previous 12 months. Paramedic Leo Nakhimoff was hit in the head and arm with a fence panel, after he and two colleagues went to treat a drunk patient who had collapsed in a relative's garden, in January last year. He said police officers who were called to help were attacked and injured, along with another paramedic. 'When you're going about your daily job treating patients you don't expect to get attacked with a fence post - it was completely unprovoked.' He said. 'It affected me quite badly at the time and I questioned whether I wanted to continue working as a paramedic. It's now at the back of my mind when I get called to similar incidents. 'At the end of the day, we're here to help people and we don't want to be in fear of being attacked.'","London Ambulance Service has register of 226 addresses where staff are believed to be at risk of physical violence while North East has a list of 236 .

A House vote on whether the U.S. should strike Syria could be delayed by a week, according to a Republican memo. While senior Republicans Eric Cantor and John Boehner support a strike, the House is likely to wait until the Senate votes on Wednesday before making its decision. News of the possible delay comes as President Obama and his aides prepare for a series of TV appearances and meetings to garner support for military action. Action: President Obama tells the G20 summit on Friday the world cannot turn a blind eye to the chemical weapons attack in Syria . At the close of the G20 summit in Russia on Friday he said: 'Over 1,400 people were gassed. Over 400 of them were children. This is not something we've fabricated. This is not something that we are using as an excuse for military action. He added: 'I was elected to end wars, and not start them,' the Huffington Post reported. The Obama administration's lobbying campaign will end on Tuesday, when the President will address the nation to make his case for the strike. He has said the military advises that an attack against Assad's regime could be effective . at any time, according to The Hill. However, Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said on Friday that Mr Obama did not intend to act without lawmakers' support. 'The President of course has the authority to act but it's neither his desire nor his intention to use that authority absent Congress backing him,' he said, according to Fox News. Rally: National Security Adviser Susan Rice and chief of staff Denis McDonough are trying to find support . Report: Inspectors examine potential evidence of the chemical weapons attack in Ain Terma . Death toll: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children . Many believe that although the . President can act without Congress backing, he will not proceed with a . strike unless he has that support. President Obama has been criticized and ridiculed by the Middle East press as he struggles to find backing for a strike in Syria at home. While some said the President's delay in action was damaging his credibility, others claimed the U.S. would use the strike to begin a war against Iran, or that Israel was pulling the strings, according to Politico. A journalist for Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, based in London, said: 'It is not surprising that Assad continues to commit his crimes against Syria and the Syrians, for Assad’s strength stems from Obama’s weakness'. Michael Young, of Lebanon's Daily Star, asked: 'Will the most overrated of American presidents be shamed into action, if only to salvage his collapsing reputation?' The generally pro-Western Al-Hayat, also based in London: said Obama had done nothing for two and a half years, 'until last August with a slip of the tongue he made the ""mistake"" of warning Bashar Assad against crossing the ""red line"" of using chemical weapons against his people'. A . first Senate vote over the 'limited and specified use' of U.S. forces . is expected on Wednesday. The resolution limits action to no more than . 90 days and bars the use of ground troops. The final vote is expected by the end of the week. In . a memo to Republican lawmakers from majority leader Mr Cantor on . Friday, he warned: 'Members should expect a robust debate and vote on an . authorization of use of military force pertaining to Syria in the next . two weeks.' A joint statement from senior Republicans last week said they expected the Syria debate to begin 'the week of September 9'. Senior aides to President Obama are due to make several TV appearances in the next couple of days as part of efforts to rally support for action in Syria, where President Assad is accused of killing more than 1,400 in a chemical weapons attack last month. National Security Adviser Susan Rice is due to make a speech at the New America Foundation on Monday, chief of staff Denis McDonough is expected to make five appearances on major political talk shows on Sunday, and John Kerry and Vice-President Biden have been urging lawmakers to vote yes. Vice-President Biden was also due to host a state dinner for Senate Republicans to encourage support. Only 28 per cent of the American public support a strike, and 48 per cent are opposed, according to a Pew poll last week. Despite this, the President has pressed the importance of making a forceful response to the atrocities carried out on August 21. Lack of support: A protest on Saturday calls on Congress to vote against action in Syria . Opposition: Anti-war protesters gather in Washington to rally against a strike on Syria . 'We are the United States of America. We cannot turn a blind eye to images like the ones we've seen out of Syria,' he said in his weekly address today. Only France has said it will support the U.S. plan for a strike against Syria, although it said it wanted to wait for the report from UN inspectors who collected evidence after the chemical weapons attack, Fox News reported. The EU agreed the attack was the work of Assad's regime but has said a potential military response should come after the UN report.","President begins final rally for support ahead of crucial ballot .

Mrs Chinnock says she is showing what can be achieved while juggling a demanding job and a growing family. She said: 'It was the first bodybuilding contest I have ever taken part in so it was a huge personal achievement for me. 'I'm still a practising barrister and I'm a busy mum of four, so that adds to the sense of victory. 'I'm flying the flag for the working mums and showing what we can achieve.'

For her, she explains it is important to be feminine as well as strong and so follows a natural workout routine to avoid the pitfalls of the stereotypical female bodybuilders.

The weather’s been a bit unpredictable here in England recently. One minute it’s gloriously sunny, the next there’s hailstones hammering down over our heads! I know which side of it I prefer… . Anyway, it’s nearly June and hopefully we’ll be seeing some serious sunshine soon. Summer is the time for bold, bright colours, and so I’ve taken inspiration from the fresh, minimalistic make up looks on the Giles and Missoni S/S ‘13 catwalk shows to create this fabulously wearable summer 'pop' lip. Pop it! Summer is the time for bold, bright colours, says Binky, who has taken inspiration from the fresh, minimalistic make up looks on the Giles and Missoni S/S '13 catwalk shows for this bright lipped look . Here’s how I did it. To start off, I applied the Daniel Sandler Invisible Radiance Foundation and Concealer. The foundation itself has a great creamy consistency – it’s not too thick and provides the perfect amount of breathable coverage for the daytime. I put a little bit on the back of my hand and dabbed it gently onto my face using my fingertips. I wanted a fresh, dewy base for this look, so this product was the ideal choice; it gives skin a gorgeous radiant glow without looking too caked-on. How To Do A Hot Pink Lip With Binky . This look is all about the lips, so naturally I didn’t want to go overboard with my eye make up. A touch of white eyeshadow was all I needed to define the eye area and make me look more awake – I opted for the light shade from the Guerlain 6 Couleurs Eyeshadow palette. Using a small brush, I swept a small amount of the shadow onto my eyelids and tear ducts. This helps open up the eyes without drawing attention away from the main attraction – the lips! Get lippy: This look is all about the lips, so naturally I didn't want to go overboard with my eye make up. A touch of white eyeshadow was all I needed . Following this, I brushed a coat of Guerlain Maxi Lash mascara onto my lashes for a hint of definition. This mascara is great for lengthening and curling the lashes; I applied just enough to give my lashes a natural looking flutter. When wearing matte lipstick, particularly in a colour this bold, it’s essential to make sure the lips are prepped beforehand so you get a perfect, long-lasting finish. I used the bareMinerals Loud and Clear Lip Sheer in Tangerine Trance to do this; it’s a gorgeous lip balm which moisturises the lips and provides a smooth base for which to apply lipstick, as well as helping the colour stay put for longer. After making sure my pout was primed to perfection, I liberally applied Daniel Sandler Luxury Matte Lipstick in Gigi for a super-vibrant pop of pink. This lipstick is the ultimate in show-stopping colour; it’s a bright fuschia with blue undertones – you certainly won’t go unnoticed with this shade! I then went back to the Daniel Sandler Invisible Radiance Foundation and Concealer and dotted a little bit of the concealer around my lips to cover up any mistakes I had made. I also dabbed some on my Cupid’s bow to make my lips look fuller and more voluptuous. For the finishing touch, I swept a teeny bit of the Clarins Skin Illusion Powder across my cheekbones to give a subtle glow. If you’re working on a budget, here are some fab alternatives you can use to recreate this look: . Rimmel Wake Me Up Foundation . MUA Pearl Eyeshadow in Shade 2 . Maybelline Great Lash Mascara . Vaseline Lip Therapy Lip Balm . Rimmel Moisture Renew Lipstick in Funtime Fuschia . MUA Undress Your Skin Highlighting Powder .

American scientists found the taller a post-menopausal woman is, the greater her risk of developing cancer . Tall women are more likely to get cancer, new research suggests. American scientists found the taller a post-menopausal woman is, the greater her risk of developing cancer. Yeshiva University research found that for every 10cm increase in height, there was a 13 per cent increase in risk of developing any cancer. The study, which revealed more cancers are associated with height than those linked to weight, has surprised scientists. Height was linked to cancers of the breast, colon, endometrium, kidney, ovary, rectum, and thyroid, as well as to multiple myeloma and melanoma. These associations did not change even after adjusting for factors known to influence these cancers, in the study of 20,928 post-menopausal women. Dr Geoffrey Kabat, senior epidemiologist of Yeshiva University, said: 'We were surprised at the number of cancer sites that were positively associated with height. 'In this data set, more cancers are associated with height than were associated with body mass index. 'Ultimately, cancer is a result of processes having to do with growth, so it makes sense that hormones or other growth factors that influence height may also influence cancer risk.' Dr Kabat said some genetic variations associated with height are also linked to cancer risk, but more studies are needed to better understand how these height-related genetic variations predispose some men and women to cancer. The scientists used data from a study that recruited post-menopausal women who were aged 50 to 79 between 1993 and 1998. At the start of the study, the women answered questions about physical activity and their height and weight were measured. Modern family actress Sofia Vergara (pictured) who is 1 metre 70 cms tall, beat thyroid cancer . The researchers identified 20,928 women who had been diagnosed with one or more invasive cancers during the follow-up period of 12 years. To study the effect of height, they accounted for many factors influencing cancers, including age, weight, education, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and hormone therapy. They found that for every 10 centimetre increase in height, there was a 13 per cent increase in risk of developing any cancer. Among specific cancers, there was a 13 to 17 per cent increase in the risk of getting melanoma and cancers of the breast, ovary, endometrium, and colon. Yeshiva University research found that for every 10cm increase in height, there was a 13 per cent increase in risk of developing any cancer. The study, which revealed more cancers are associated with height than those linked to weight, has surprised scientists . There was a 23 to 29 per cent increase in the risk of developing cancers of the kidney, rectum, thyroid, and blood. Of the 19 cancers studied, none showed a negative association with height. The scientists also examined the participants' mammography, Pap, and colorectal cancer screening histories, which could have swayed conclusions of the study, but found that the results remained unchanged. Dr Kabat said: 'The association of height with a number of cancer sites suggests that exposures in early life, including nutrition, play a role in influencing a person's risk of cancer. 'There is currently a great deal of interest in early-life events that influence health in adulthood and our study fits with this area.' The findings were published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.","American scientists found that for every 10cm increase in height in a taller post-menopausal woman, there is a 13 per cent increase cancer risk .

The maxi dress has made a glamorous transition from being hippy chick holiday wear to being an absolute summer style staple. Already being sported this season by the likes of Kim Kardashian and boho babe Vanessa Hudgens, it is safe to say that the maxi is making its way back into our wardrobe. And one high-street supermarket giant has noticed a huge boom in sales with the floaty dresses proving so popular that a first run of 62,000 of them sold out in a week. Summer trend: Maxi dresses are tipped to be a huge trend again this summer, with one high street giant noting massive sales. Myleene Klass, Jessica Alba and Kim Kardashian are all fans of the summer style . In what could be the fashion hit of the summer, more than £1 million worth of the George-branded dresses were cleared from Asda shelves in just seven days earlier this month. The sleeveless dresses in floral patterns are clearly more suitable for better weather than most of the country is experiencing at the moment, with many bought as a holiday staple. But the sales have also been boosted by a clever new advertising and delivery strategy from the Leeds-based chain, according to industry experts. Asda has introduced a fast changing digital advertising campaign in stores, online and elsewhere, that reacts to the weather as it happens alongside a quick turnaround of stock on shelves. So if it rains, all the ads start promoting waterproof clothing and staff in the shops quickly swap swimwear for wellies and so on. Likewise, when the sun suddenly makes an appearance, adverts for shorts and t-shirts replace those for anoraks and jumpers as does the stock on the shelves. Big boom: In what could be the fashion hit of the summer, more than £1 million worth of the George-branded dresses were cleared from the shelves in just seven days earlier this month. Paris Hilton and Vanessa Hudgens have long championed the trend . The maxi dress ads appeared during the occasional bursts of hot weather earlier in May and sparked a stampede from customers eager to snap them up, Asda admitted. A spokesman said: 'For the first time, George has launched clever digital advertising banners across major media outlets, which will respond immediately to changes in the weather. 'The adverts will switch between summer essentials and must-haves when the temperature increases to cover-ups, waterproofs and wellies when the weather takes a turn for the worse.' 'Maxi dresses are the perfect answer to . the unpredictable British weather, they'll keep you cool in the sun and . wrapped up should the weather take a turn for the worse' The idea came after last year's summer proved so hard to predict with the weather constantly alternating between rain and sun, hot and cold. Fiona Lambert, brand director for George, added: 'We sold just over £1 million of maxi dresses at the beginning of May as the temperatures increased and shoppers updated their summer wardrobes. 'Maxi dresses are the perfect answer to the unpredictable British weather, they'll keep you cool in the sun and wrapped up should the weather take a turn for the worse.

Venice may soon have to ditch its nickname of The Floating City - as it is sinking into the water more than five times quicker than previously thought. Scientists say the city is also tilting to the east and heading out to the Adriatic Sea, as it is hit by more floods than ever before. Previous studies had shown water-levels in the former capital of the Maritime Venetian Republic had stabilised. But the new research claims it has actually submerged, and tilted to the east, by an unprecedented 2mm per year over the last decade. Scroll down for video... Future of Venice: Scientists say the city is falling into the water five times quicker than once thought, good news for this well-prepared canoeist who took to St Mark's Square . Changes: NMA News Direct's animated video shows how much Venice will tilt in the next 20 years (scroll down to see the film) Earlier studies suggest it was submerging at just 0.04mm per year. The patches of land in Venice's 117 island lagoon are also sinking. Northern sections are dropping between 2 to 3mm per year, while the southern lagoon is subsiding by 3 to 4mm over the same period. Yehuda Bock, research geodesist with Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, said: 'Venice appears to be continuing to subside. It's a small effect, but it's important.' City of Water: It may be known as a water lover's paradise, but things are taken a step too far when entire streets and pathways are flooded, like in 2008 . Normal service: St Mark's Square pictured on a non-waterlogged day . Bock, who is publishing a study in American Geophysical Union's journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems on Wednesday, said the current subsidence was due to natural causes, such as plate tectonics. 'The Adriatic plate, which includes . Venice, subducts beneath the Apennines Mountains and causes the city and . its environs to drop slightly in elevation,' he said. Population: 270,098 . Name derived from ancient Veneti people . Nicknames: Queen of the Adriatic, City of Water, City of Masks, City of Bridges, and The Floating City .

Played important role in history of symphonic and operatic music: birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi . And he added that the frequency of floods in Venice is increasing. Residents now have to, about four or five times each year, walk on wooden planks to stay above the floodwaters in large parts of the city. The study may spark fears not enough is being done to save the city's Gothic and Byzantine palazzos from plunging into the water. But experts at Consorzio Venezia Nuova, a group in charge of safeguarding Venice and the lagoon, highlighted concerns about the report. A source told NBC News: 'I learned about the new research from journalists like yourself. 'We have records of the subsiding of Venice for hundreds of years, and yet they haven’t called us. 'We have calculated the city has been sinking 3 to 4cms per century. 'Now they say 2mm per year… that means Venice would sink 20cm every 100 years. That's more than five times more than we calculated. So I’ll believe it when I see it.' Only get worse: A woman walks on Piazza San Marco during floods in 2008, which experts say is a serious sign of things to come . And Bock himself admitted a multi-billion dollar investment in the city's flood defence system would hopefully prevent the tourist destination from sinking into the abyss. He said: 'A multi-billion-dollar effort to install flood-protection walls that can be raised to block incoming tides is nearing completion. 'The adjustable barriers were designed to protect the city from tides that are coming in higher as overall sea levels are rising in response to climate change.'",City also gradually tilting eastwards into Adriatic Sea .

But even models get hang-ups about their appearance and for Jo, it was her 'muffin top'. She felt she had fat hanging over her waistline that made her feel self-conscious when doing bikini shoots. But the solution the 22-year-old sought to boost her confidence left her self-esteem lower than ever. Bad result: Jo was left with red and lumpy scars after having liposuction . Risk: The angry scars were a result of Jo getting an infection after her treatment . She said: 'The procedure that was meant to improve my confidence has left me feeling worse than I did beforehand. 'From a young age I was conscious of my 'muffin top' so I went for liposuction thinking it would improve my confidence.' Jo spent £2,600 to have the cosmetic procedure where fat is sucked from the body. She booked the treatment and paid for . it in advance but by the time she went to have it, she had lost some . pounds naturally so it was no longer necessary. However as she didn't . want to lose her money she went through with it regardless. She said: 'When I went to my consultant I felt I . didn't need it but I had already paid all the money up front. I would . have lost that if I didn't do it so I felt I had to go through with it. I wish I had thought about it more.' Last chance: Jo meets Mr Vijh who she hopes can solve her problem . Diagnosis: The surgeon said the scars should have faded after two years and the only option would be to cut them out . Liposuction involves making incisions in the skin so a suction tube can then be inserted to suck fat out. As with all surgery, the treatment comes with a risk of the wounds getting infected afterwards and unfortunately for Jo, this happened to her. After treatment for the infection she was left with lumpy, red scars that still hadn't faded two years after the liposuction. Three weeks later: After Mr Vijh's treatment, Jo's scar are fainter and not as lumpy as they were before . She said: 'They're red and inflamed and lumpy and can be quite sore. The procedure has been so disappointing and left me feeling self conscious.' The scars also affected the work Jo felt she could take on in her modelling career. Jo hoped the TLC TV show Last Chance Salon could be her salvation. She revealed her scars to the show's resident cosmetic surgeon Mr Vik Vijh who said, 'they should have gone by now.' He said the only solution would be for Jo to go under the knife again under local anesthetic so he could cut out the old scars. The treatment was a success and Jo returned to the Salon three weeks later to show off the results. Her scars were now less red, painful and lumpy and Mr Vijh told her they would continue to fade as time passed. Confidence restored: The scars will continue to fade and the model now feels ready to return to doing bikini shoots . Jo revealed that the treatment had given her the confidence boost she needed and as a result, she had secured a job in Marbella over the summer modelling swimwear. She said: 'I'm really excited I'm going to be . modelling bikinis in Marbella. It's something I would never have been able to do . as the scars were before.'

The 48-year-old Coronation Street actor denies 12 sex offences against a young girl, including five of rape.

But he denied a claim that he had told someone they would not believe ‘what things are inside my head’. Le Vell, on trial under his real name Michael Turner, denied claims he drank up to 12 pints a night to hide the shame of being a paedophile. The actor admitted he had a drink problem, had a series of one-night stands and had been having an affair while his wife was being treated for breast cancer. But while he often drank seven or eight pints a night, and on occasions 12, he was never out of control and would never have sexually abused a six-year-old girl. Eleanor Laws QC, prosecuting, suggested Le Vell drank so much because he was ashamed of the sexual abuse he had committed. She asked the actor, who has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 soap for 30 years: ‘Are you a troubled man?

Despite the comparative ease for hackers, 67 per cent of us only change passwords when we have to. Nearly half of us also write our passwords down, with three per cent opting for a note on their desk . The poll of 2,000 people also found that nearly a half of us have shared a password with someone else. Women are more likely to share their password than men - and over twice as likely to share it with their child. Nearly half of us also write our passwords down, with three per cent opting for a note on their desk. Experts warn that in 2013 one in five people admit to having clicked on spam links, and only 41 per cent have updated their antivirus software. Despite half of Britons knowing someone whose online account has been compromised, many are still leaving the door wide open to hackers . Almost one in five people has left their computer without logging out of a service, with one in seven Brits taking advantage of this lax approach to online security and perusing their partner's emails. Eran Feigenbaum, Director of Security, Google Apps said: ‘People often leave their information open to online security breaches without even realising it. ‘Lax attitudes to online security can lead to serious consequences if strangers access your information. ‘Simple steps such as choosing more complicated passwords, always logging out of services and considering two-factor authentication, which requires more than just a password to access your account, can make a real difference to your security online.’","A pet's name is the most common online password in the UK .

Paul Hodge, 40, came up with the idea when he got bored with the sport he'd been playing for decades. He said: ‘I've been playing golf for 20 years, but have been bored with the game. ‘A few friends showed me some powerful electric skateboards that they had built several years ago. ‘I knew right away there was going to be some sort of business opportunity with them, but didn't know exactly what. ‘We decided to target golf, the market is huge, courses are fun to ride on and it seemed like a perfect fit.’ Mr Hodge, from Seattle, Washington, was tired of using a buggy and wanted to inject life back into the sport. ‘A golf buggy is boring, the GolfBoard makes golf fun again, I enjoy riding to get my ball, more than the golfing itself now,’ he said. It can last for 36 holes and does not struggle on the course with its 3.5 inch wide turf tyres, which leave a smaller footprint compared to a buggy . ‘I have done a little skateboarding, and more snowboarding and some surfing, other members of our team are big surfers. ‘It has a feeling of surfing, especially without the bindings, with the bindings it really feels a lot like snowboarding.’ Mr Hodge claims that his creation can revolutionise the world of golf and encourage younger people to get into the sport. ‘Golf needs to attract the younger crowds to survive as the average age of golfers is rising,’ he said. ‘It also speeds the game up, allowing each person to have their own cart allowing golf courses to push through more traffic. ‘I doubt they will be used in major tournaments, but I do expect to see them adopted on 90 per cent of golf courses across America and beyond.’ The bag handle provides stability and storage space for golf gear, snacks, and refreshments .","Seattle-based golfer, Paul Hodge, came up with the idea to liven up the sport .

"By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 08:11 EST, 2 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:00 EST, 2 April 2012 . It’s widely believed that global warming began in the 1970s, but new ocean temperature readings show that the Earth has in fact been warming for far longer. A study by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego traced ocean warming to the late 19th century, which implies, say researchers, that the Earth’s climate as a whole has been heating up since then. The report is the first global comparison of temperature between the historic voyage of HMS Challenger between 1872 and 1876 and modern data obtained by ocean-probing robots now continuously reporting temperatures via the global Argo program. Heat is on: The oceans have been warming since the 1870s, according to new research . The research, led by oceanographer Dean Roemmich, shows a .33C (.59F) average increase in the upper portions of the ocean to 700 metres (2,300 feet) depth. The increase was largest at the ocean surface, .59C (1.1F), decreasing to .12C (.22 F) at 900 metres (2,950 feet) depth. Scientists have previously determined that nearly 90 per cent of the excess heat added to Earth's climate system since the 1960s has been stored in the oceans. The new study, published in the April 1 advance online edition of Nature Climate Change and co-authored by John Gould of the United Kingdom-based National Oceanography Centre and John Gilson of Scripps Oceanography, pushes the ocean warming trend back much earlier. ‘The significance of the study is not only that we see a temperature difference that indicates warming on a global scale, but that the magnitude of the temperature change since the 1870s is twice that observed over the past 50 years,’ said Roemmich, co-chairman of the International Argo Steering Team. ‘This implies that the time scale for the warming of the ocean is not just the last 50 years but at least the last 100 years.’ Although the Challenger data set covers only some 300 temperature soundings (measurements from the sea surface down to the deep ocean) around the world, the information sets a baseline for temperature change in the world's oceans, which are now sampled continuously through Argo's unprecedented global coverage. Nearly 3,500 free-drifting profiling Argo floats each collect a temperature profile every 10 days. Making a splash: HMS Challenger travelled nearly 70,000 miles for its research mission . Roemmich believes the new findings, a piece of a larger puzzle of understanding the earth's climate, help scientists to understand the longer record of sea-level rise, because the expansion of seawater due to warming is a significant contributor to rising sea level. What’s more, the 100-year timescale of ocean warming implies that the Earth's climate system as a whole has been gaining heat for at least that long. HMS Challenger was a former battleship modified to carry out research.She collected sealife and sediment samples and measured ocean temperatures on a marathon 68,890 mile voyage. The steam-assisted ship carried a crew of 243 officers and scientists who worked in on-board laboratories.",Ocean surface temperature has risen .59C (1.1F) since the 1870s .

A woman undergoing a minor surgery at a Southern California hospital was shocked to discover that her anesthesiologist decorated her face with stickers while she was unconscious and then had a nurse text her a photo of his handiwork. According to a lawsuit filed by the patient, Veronica Valdez, during an operation on her finger at Torrance Memorial Medical Center in October 2011, Dr. Patrick Yang used stickers to give her a black mustache and teardrops under her left eye. A nurse's aide then used a cell phone to . snap a picture of Valdez, 36, looking like ‘a male member of a street . gang,’ according to the court filings cited by ABC7. Scroll down for video . Cruel joke: Veronica Valdez, 36, had her face decorated with stickers by her anesthesiologist to make it look like she has a mustache and teardrops while she was unconscious during surgery . Miss Valdez worked at the hospital for 13 years before the surgery and was ‘friendly’ with the anesthesiologist and staff present in the operating room that day. The hospital called the incident a breach of professionalism and said in a statement that it demonstrated poor judgment on the part of the doctor and the nurse’s aide borne out of their familiarity with the patient, according to the Los Angeles Times. Dr Yang said in a deposition that he cut out and colored the stickers, and then placed them on Valdez's face near the end of the hour-long procedure. ‘I thought she would think this is funny and she would appreciate it,’ he said. The Daily Breeze reported that when Yang was asked if he was bored at the time, he responded that he simply thought that his then-colleague ‘would get a kick out of it.’ Nursing attendant Patricia Gomez took Valdez's photo at Yang’s request. Gomez testified in her deposition that she didn't email or post the photo anywhere, and deleted it after showing it to Valdez. ‘I felt violated. I was in shock,’ Valdez said in court documents. Others testified in depositions about seeing a surgery photo of Valdez posted on Facebook. In court filings, lawyers for the hospital said there was no evidence the photo was published online. See more at KTLA.com . Medical facility: Miss Valdez went in for a minor procedure on her finger at Torrance Memorial Medical Center, where she herself had worked for 13 years before the 2011 incident . Hospital officials reported the incident to state regulators as a potential violation of medical privacy. Dr Yang and other employees involved in the incident were briefly suspended, but ultimately allowed to keep their jobs. Hospital employees were also given additional training on privacy in the aftermath of the incident. Torrance has since put in place a zero-tolerance policy for any unauthorized photography, and staffers now must sign a confidentially agreement. Prankster: Dr Patrick Yang, who was Valdez's anesthesiologist, said during his deposition that he thought his patient would 'get a kick out of' the mustache and teardrops . Valdez's civil suit is scheduled for trial in January. She's seeking damages from the hospital, the anesthesiologist and his medical group for violation of privacy, infliction of emotional distress and other allegations. Her attorney, Andrew Ryan, said Miss Valdez was forced to quit her job ordering and maintaining supplies for the hospital's operating rooms because she was ‘ridiculed and humiliated while under anesthesia.’ Valdez's lawsuit claims that there may also be a sexually suggestive photo of her taken during the procedure. According to court filings, Miss Valdez’s neck was positioned while she under anesthesia ‘so that they could keep her mouth open in order to make a crude sexual joke.’ In response, Torrance Memorial said the allegations in Valdez's lawsuit were ‘factually inaccurate, grossly exaggerated or fabricated.’ It will present a motion to dismiss the case in November. In court filings, the hospital contends that Valdez is trying to ‘play litigation lottery’ against a ‘deep-pocket defendant.’ Ryan said that his client had had some disagreements with staffers in the operating room in the past, which may have led to the 2011 incident.","Veronica Valdez, 36, went in for surgery on her finger at Torrance Memorial Medical Center in October 2011 .

The 23-year-old only spoke to say 'not guilty' to each of the counts read out in Fall River Superior Court on Friday as the mother of his alleged victim, Odin Lloyd, sobbed throughout the proceedings. The former New England Patriots tight end was indicted last month, when he was hit with a laundry list of criminal charges, including first-degree murder, carrying a firearm and possession of a firearm. He pleaded not guilty to the six charges as his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins and supporters wearing 'Free AH 81' looked on. He will continue to be held without bail until his next hearing in October.

'Every time there’s a story out it's always about the alleged murder and it's not about the tragedy that happened to Odin,' she said. 'The loss that all of us have taken and the fact that he is a human and his life was taken.' Prosecutors claim that Hernandez . orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to . people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier. It has also been suggested that he killed Lloyd because he knew about Hernandez's involvement in a 2012 double homicide. Hernandez has never been charged in that case.

Moments later, authorities say, Lloyd was dead after gunshots rang out in an unpaved construction area by a warehouse after he apparently got out of the car for what he thought was a bathroom break. Authorities have not said who fired the shots, but according to court documents, Ortiz told police in Florida that Wallace said it was Hernandez. Wallace has pleaded not guilty to a charge of accessory to murder after the fact. Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to a firearm charge. Both are being held in jail without bail.

The Korean company will be the first major smartphone manufacturer to release a device that resembles a smartphone worn on the wrist, although other, similar devices such as the Pebble and Androidly are already on sale.

The site also claims it has a 4MP camera in the strap, voice commands, preloaded Android apps for tracking fitness, health and connecting with social networks as well as call logs when synced with an Android phone. Engineer and tech expert Sami Mughal from OxGadgets told MailOnline: 'As far as timing goes, it is everything. It won't be easy for many rivals to bring out a competitor watch a few months from now based on the lessons learnt from the Galaxy Gear. 'They can make adjustments, but you can hardly expect a whole new product. Apple are Marmite at the moment; you either love them or hate them. 'Most Android fans fall in the latter category, and they'll probably go straight for anything that comes with the Samsung badge on it.' Annette Zimmermann, an analyst at research firm Gartner, told CNBC: 'In . Gartner's device forecast we have an assumption built into our model . that says that less than 3 percent of consumers replacing their . smartphone will replace it with a smartwatch in 2017.' She added that although the device will set Samsung and Apple apart, the take up is likely to be slow. Other analysts have claimed that the technology won't become mainstream until Apple launches its own version of the device: 'It worked for the iPad, and it worked with smartphones (the iPhone) as well, so there may be some calculated truth to this prediction,' continued Mughal. This has been dubbed by Jonathan Gaw, research manager at IDC, as waiting for an 'iPod moment' - where the market needs to be ready for a device and the hardware, software and design is just so to make the gadget popular and far reaching. The official Galaxy Gear looks similar to this 2009 concept of a Samsung smart watch, designed by Joseph Loetiko.

Those are concepts for future products.’ The gadget will also compete against Google's Glass wearable computer, which is expected to go on sale to the public next year. Samsung is also expected to launch a new version of its Note ‘phablet’- a combined phone and tablet - at the event. Samsung announced earlier this year it is 'investing heavily' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health.

School cricket coach Glyn Thompson, 31, was jailed for eight years today after admitting having an affair with a 14-year-old . A school cricket coach who had an 18-month affair with a teenage girl was jailed for eight years today. Glyn Thompson, 31, had sex with 14-year-old on his desk at the school where he worked, in his car and at both her family home and the family home he shared with the mother of his young son. The father of one from Burnley, Lancashire, taught at the town's Stoneyholme Community Primary School. During the affair he bought a pregnancy test for the teenager to ensure she was not carrying his baby. The scandal was exposed when the girl confessed to a friend in an internet chatroom and the friend sent an anonymous letter to the school. Thompson was later suspended and then sacked from his teaching job. At Preston Crown Court Thompson, whose partner was also a teacher at the school, pleaded guilty to nine counts of sexual activity with a child. The illicit relationship began after Thompson met the girl when she was 13 and the pair began swapping 'flirty' emails. Sylvia Dacre, prosecuting, said Thompson began to groom the girl, adding: 'He asked her for pictures of herself, which she provided.' She said he began asking her for pictures in which she was pulling down her t-shirt to reveal her chest, and added: 'This gradually progressed to her providing naked pictures. 'He sent one back to her. 'He began taking her to a room at the school, where he physically abused her. He began to touch her all round and began to kiss her on the mouth.' 'She felt pressured and scared. If she tried to refuse he would repeatedly ask her until he got what he wanted.' Scene of affair: Thompson was a cricket coach at Stoneyholme Primary School and had sex with the girl there . The girl later told police: ‘I was scared, I didn’t know what to do but eventually I got the hang of this.' Thompson began pestering the girl for sex until they eventually had intercourse over his desk in a classroom, the court heard. The girl said in her statement to police: I kept refusing because I didn’t want to but finally he got to me. I was scared. I didn’t want to, I didn’t know what it was going to be like. 'On the first occasion it hurt a bit. I didn’t want to say anything - I just closed my eyes.' The pair also had sex in the living room of his family home and in the teacher's car, during which he made her lie on the car seats so she couldn’t be seen. The affair emerged when the girl confided in a friend online. The friend was so concerned she told a mother - then wrote an anonymous letter to the school revealing what has been happening. Thompson, who has a seven-year-old son, later told police the relationship was 'mutual' and said he was 'sorry', and that he didn’t intend to 'use' her. The headmistress of Stoneyholme said she was pleased with the eight-year jail sentence Mr Thompson received . In mitigation, defence counsel Phillip Holden said: 'He has expressed repeatedly his remorse for his behaviour. 'He’s had a great deal of time to reflect on his offending and has set out in a letter how he feels and the sorrow that he feels both to the victim and to his wider family and the family of the victim. 'Although the complainant admits to being scared, she did not show that to the defendant, who is adamant he didn’t pick up any fear. 'He’s a man who has lost his job and good name, admittedly through his own actions. It’s clear he’s an intelligent man, a man with some real promise. 'It’s a great tragedy that he should find himself in the position he finds himself in today.' Thompson had pleaded guilty to one count of causing a child to engage in sexual activity and eight counts count of sexual activity with a child at a hearing at Burnley Crown Court in July. Passing sentence today, Judge Jonathan Gibson banned Thompson from working with children and ordered him to sign the Sex Offender Register for life. He said: 'It is clear to me she was young and naive and inexperienced when you began to groom her. This includes many emails and exchanging photographs.' 'The effects of your offending will be with the complainant and her family for years to come.' Outside court, DC Liz Owens of Lancashire Police: 'I am pleased with the sentence, given the horrendous ordeal he put his young victim through. 'He took advantage of a young girl and groomed her over a long period of time. 'We will continue to work with other agencies to support her and hope that today’s sentence will bring her some closure.' Lisa Davison, headteacher at Stoneyholme Primary School, said: 'Mr Thompson was immediately suspended from his role in school and has since been dismissed. 'I am pleased that this matter has been dealt with so quickly and that Mr Thompson has received a lengthy prison sentence.'","Glyn Thompson, from Burnley, was jailed for eight years today at Preston Crown Court .

Pictures of the honorary mayor of a tiny Alaska town have been released, showing the aftermath of the weekend dog attack on Stubbs the cat. Stubbs is seen sedated and under veterinary care after he was badly injured in the vicious dog attack in Talkeetna, a quirky community of 900 that elected him in a write-in campaign 15 years ago. Talkeetna has no human mayor, so you could say 16-year-old Stubbs is the reigning leader of the town. In recovery: Stubbs the cat is pictured at the Big Lake-Susitna Veterinary Hospital in Big Lake, Alaska after three hours of surgery following the attack . 'He's everybody's guy,' said Stubbs' owner, Lauri Stec, who manages Nagley's General Store, where the Garfield lookalike lives and mingles with locals and tourists alike. Saturday's attack by the loose dog left Stubbs with a punctured lung, bruised hips, a long deep gash on his side and a sternum fractured to the point it might need to be repaired with a plate. Stec, who said she knows the dog that was involved, has reported the attack with borough animal control officials.  Stubbs underwent three hours of surgery after the attack and his treatment has cost $2,000. The next few days will be crucial in Stubbs' recovery, but the cat has begun to sit up and eat. A tube inserted in his lung has been removed. All in all, Stubbs is holding his own, Stec said. 'He's a freaking tough boy,' she said. Using his nine lives: Stubbs' treatment has cost $2,000 but his owner says he's worth every penny . Stubbs, already popular nationally, gained even more fans outside of Alaska when word got out about the attack. Among his followers are tourists stopping in the community that serves as the last stop for travelers and climbers visiting Mount McKinley, North America's tallest peak. The town, 115 miles north of Anchorage, is purported to be the inspiration for the town in the TV series, Northern Exposure. It's a place dotted with artist shops, where bachelors are auctioned off at a yearly fundraiser ball and where women compete in a wilderness contest. Even in such a place, Stubbs is a star. 'We all love him,' said Geoff . Pfeiffer, a waiter at the West Rib Pub and Cafe located inside the same . building as the general store. The . staff there is hanging on to Stubbs' wine glass, hoping they get to . fill it again with water and a catnip garnish, a feline cocktail for a . regular who commands attention every time he comes in. 'It's like Elvis has entered the building,' Pfeiffer said. Sourpuss: Stubbs seen taking a cat nap before the attack . Town hall: Mayor Stubbs spends his days perched on a counter at Nagley's Store, pictured, in Talkeetna . Stubbs has his own Facebook page, filled with posts this week from well-wishers around the world. There is also a Twitter account purporting to be from Stubbs, but Stec said she's not involved with that account. Attempts by The Associated Press to reach the account owner weren't immediately successful Thursday. Before . Saturday, Stubbs had already used up a few of his nine lives. In the . past, he has been shot by a BB gun, and still has a BB lodged inside. He's . fallen into a cold fryer vat at the West Rib when the staff was . changing the oil.

But what if astronauts could beam their favourite HD videos from Earth? Or create their own 3D films for us to see? That's exactly what Nasa hopes to achieve by testing a system that could replace primitive radio transmissions, which are currently used in space, with laser-based communication. The agency claims the technology will make it possible to eventually send huge amounts of data to deep space. However, its first step will be to establish a two-way laser communication with the moon to prove that the technology is possible. Scroll down for videos... Nasa is planning to ditch primitive radio transmissions and start communicating with lasers in space. The experiment is part of the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) mission which will be hosted aboard LADEE satellite (pictured) The experiment is part of the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) mission which is scheduled to launch on Friday. As well as HD video it could, for instance, also allow humans to remotely control machines for tasks such as asteroid mining or building structures on the moon. LLCD is Nasa’s first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. ‘The goal of the LLCD experiment is to validate and build confidence in this technology so that future missions will consider using it,’ said Don Cornwell, LLCD manager. VIDEO: An overview of the LLCD mission . ‘We can even envision such a laser-based system enabling a robotic mission to an asteroid,’ he added. ‘It could have 3D, high-definition video signals transmitted to Earth providing essentially “telepresence” to a human controller on the ground.’ Since Nasa first ventured into space, radio frequency (RF) communication has been the communications platform used. But it is now reaching its limit as demand for more data capacity increases. According to Nasa, laser communication would be less likely to suffer from interference, another limitation of radio frequency (RF) signals. ‘LLCD is designed to send six times more data from the moon using a smaller transmitter with 25 per cent less power as compared to the equivalent state-of-the-art radio (RF) system,’ said Cornwell. A primary ground terminal at Nasa's White Sands Complex in New Mexico will receive and transmit signals . ‘Lasers are also more secure and less susceptible to interference and jamming.’ The LLCD experiment is hosted aboard Nasa’s LADEE: a 100-day robotic mission designed, built, integrated, tested and will be operated by Ames. The LADEE spacecraft will take 30 days to reach the moon because of its flight path. LLCD will begin operations shortly after arrival into lunar orbit and continue for 30 days afterward. LLCD’s main mission objective is to transmit hundreds of millions of bits of data per second from the moon to Earth. This is equivalent to transmitting more than 100 HD television channels simultaneously. LLCD receiving capability will also be tested as tens of millions of bits per second are sent from Earth to the spacecraft. An MIT team designed, built, and tested the terminal. They will be responsible for LLCD's operation at that site . There is a primary ground terminal at Nasa’s White Sands Complex in New Mexico, to receive and transmit LLCD signals. An MIT team designed, built, and tested the terminal. They also will be responsible for LLCD’s operation at that site. There are two alternate sites, one located at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, which is for receiving only. The other is being provided by the European Space Agency on the Spanish island of Tenerife, off the coast of Africa. It will have two-way communication capability with LLCD. VIDEO: In January, an image of Mona Lisa was transmitted to Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft orbiting the moon . 'Having several sites gives us alternatives which greatly reduces the possibility of interference from clouds,' said Cornwell. Nasa engineers believe this technology is even more exciting for communications beyond Earth’s orbit. In the past, Nasa has experimented with sending low amounts of individual pulses to cameras on far-away space probes near Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury. Recently, an image of Leonardo da Vinci’s painting, the Mona Lisa, was transmitted to Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft orbiting the moon. ‘But this was done at only hundreds of data bits per second,’ said Cornwell. ‘LLCD will be the first dedicated optical communication system and will send data millions of times faster.’","'Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration' mission will launch on Friday .

The star, who recently had both buttocks and her back tattooed with flowers, was nothing on these inked-up specimens, who have chosen to decorate their heads with an array of bizarre designs. From a topless angel emerging from between pigtails to a full English breakfast slathered all over one chap's bald bonce, it seems nothing is too weird - or too painful-looking - for true body art aficionados. Peek-a-boo: A chain-bearing child is painted exploding out of the flesh at the back of this person's neck . And while a study by the University of St . Andrews reveals today that managers are less likely to employ someone . if they have a tattoo, there are clearly some who want to have . their tatts as in-your-face as possible. The Metropolitan Police has recently banned its officers from getting visible tattoos, according to the BBC, with Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe saying they 'damage the professional image of the police'. Even so, one in five people in Britain has a tattoo of some kind - although most of them are a little less noticeable than this hair-splitting selection. And among 19- to 44-year-olds, that figure rises to 29 per cent - for both men and women. Thick skull: You've heard the expression 'built like a brick wall'...

A few days ago, David Beckham stripped down to his swimming shorts on the beach - flashing a brand new design on the right side of his chest that brought his tattoo collection up to a whopping total of 33. TV presenter Ferne Cotton recently said she regretted 'one or two' of her tattoos - then made a quick U-turn in an interview today with Cosmopolitan, saying she has stopped caring what other people think about her and her tattoos. 'I don't give a c*** what people think anymore. I don't care if people say they don't like my tattoos,' she said. 'They are all a part of who I am.' Feeling hungry?

The instrument used to create the designs today - the twin-coil electromagnetic tattoo needle - was patented in 1891.

"By . Harry Mount . PUBLISHED: . 17:45 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:11 EST, 5 September 2013 . They make up the most famous — and valuable — series of pictures in the history of art. In a staggering burst of creative energy, culminating in an agonising mental breakdown that led him to slice off his own ear, Vincent van Gogh produced a series of paintings of cut sunflowers in a vase. In total, there were seven different versions. The pictures are now scattered to the far corners of the world. Missing link: This photograph of the destroyed second version was found in a Japanese museum . One, unseen in public since 1948, is in the private collection of an unknown millionaire, revealed only to his closest friends. Five others are in museums — in Philadelphia, Amsterdam, Munich, Tokyo (bought for a world-record £25 million in 1987) and our own National Gallery in London. But the seventh was destroyed during World War II. Called Six Sunflowers and painted in August 1888, it had been in the collection of a wealthy collector, Koyata Yamamoto, living on Japan’s coast when his town was hit by an American bomb on August 6, 1945 — coincidentally, the day the atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima. The painting, hanging over the sofa in Yamamoto’s sitting room, was obliterated. Yamamoto managed to escape the raging firestorm, but his prized picture — with its heavy frame — was too cumbersome to carry. Now, almost 70 years later, a British art historian has unearthed a colour photograph which reveals the work in all its glory. Tortured: A self-portrait of Van Gogh . The print — with its vivid yellows, . glowing oranges, citrus greens and royal blue background — gives us a . rare glimpse of what the original might have looked like. Art . historian Martin Bailey stumbled on the photo while researching a book . on the Sunflower series. As well as preserving Van Gogh’s original bold . colours, it also shows the unusual, heavy, timber frame that was . specially chosen by the artist. While most picture frames at the time were white, Van Gogh chose an orange one to play against the orange of the sunflowers. With . the rediscovery of the photograph of the seventh picture, the full . story of the Sunflowers series at last falls into place. Van Gogh . painted them at a critical point in his life. Aged 35, he was less than . two years from death, his career an unmitigated failure, his excitement . at painting mingled with disappointment, sadness and self-destructive . mania. Before turning to painting, he had . been an art dealer and teacher in England — in Brixton, Ramsgate and . Isleworth — a bookseller in Holland, and a missionary in Belgium. Those . around him despaired of his prospects almost as much as he despaired of . himself. In one letter, he . angrily reported that his family wanted him to become a carpenter, . accountant or baker. Safe to say, the prospects of being a world-famous . artist seemed remote. His . romantic life was an equal disaster. When he proposed to the daughter of . his Brixton landlady, she refused because she was already engaged to a . former lodger. The first version: Van Gogh's initial painting is in a private collection . A decade later, proposing to  his widowed Dutch cousin, she replied: ‘Nooit, neen, nimmer.’ (‘No, nay, never.’) When . she told him that he couldn’t see her again, he thrust his hand into . the flame of a light, saying to her father, his uncle: ‘Let me see her . for as long as I can hold my hand in  this flame.’ The desperate ploy . didn’t work. A relationship . with an alcoholic prostitute followed — and his romantic prospects . weren’t improved by a bout of gonorrhoea in 1883. He is also thought to . have contracted syphilis. Nor were his violent mood swings helped by a . poor diet, rich only in absinthe and tobacco. In February 1888, he moved . to Arles in Provence, seeking refuge from his misery and hoping the . fresh air would alleviate his chronic smoker’s cough. The third version (left) is in the Neue Pinakothek in Munich, while the fourth version (right) hangs in the National Gallery in London . He signed a lease on the so-called Yellow House, which he was to immortalise in so many of his canvases, and started painting obsessively. And what obsessed him most were sunflowers. A letter written at the time from Van Gogh to his art-dealer brother, Theo, survives. ‘I’m painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse [a local fish soup],’ he wrote, ‘which won’t surprise you when it’s a question of painting large sunflowers. I’d like to do a decoration for the studio. Nothing but large sunflowers.’ And so he began the pictures that would sell for millions — but not until after his death. During his lifetime, Van Gogh was painfully aware of how unpopular his work was. In fact, he only ever sold one painting. Two days after that first letter to Theo, he wrote another, saying: ‘We live in times when there’s no market for what we do ... I fear that it will scarcely change during our lifetime.’ Van Gogh didn’t just have an exceptional talent. He was also astonishingly quick — the first four sunflower pictures were done in a week. But for all their golden, glowing colours, no one would buy them. A repeat of painting No 3 (left): On show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and (right) a replica of number four...now in Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum . Despairing, but not yet defeated, Van Gogh continued working at a furious rate through the autumn of 1888. He painted a self-portrait, a picture of fellow artist Paul Gauguin who was visiting him at Arles and several famous pictures of empty chairs. Relations with Gauguin were stormy and Van Gogh was terrified his friend might desert him, leaving him alone with his demons in Arles. Then came the blow that sent him off the rails for good. On December 23, he received a letter from his adored brother, Theo, saying he was getting married. That very evening, he slashed off a chunk of his ear in an Arles brothel, handing it over, wrapped in newspaper, to a prostitute, asking her to ‘keep this object carefully’. It wasn’t that Van Gogh disliked his new sister-in-law, Johanna Bonger, but he feared she would interfere with his close relationship with his brother. ‘Vincent was worried about losing his brother’s support, both emotional and financial,’ art historian Martin Bailey writes in his new book. ‘And these fears played a key role in provoking his self-mutilation a few hours later.’ By January, Van Gogh had recovered enough to leave hospital and paint three winter copies of his summer sunflower pictures. But the damage had been done and he entered a spiral of self-destruction. Between February and May, he was in hospital again, suffering from hallucinations and paranoid fantasies that he was being poisoned. Among local villagers he had acquired the nickname ‘fou roux’, the mad redhead. Final painting of version four: See it at Sompo Museum of Art, Tokyo . In May, he was moved to an asylum in nearby Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. He remained there for a year, sometimes seeming to recover his senses, at other times suffering crippling relapses. Though his mind was tortured with visions and delusions, he continued to produce bold, ravishing canvases of the neighbouring olive groves, vineyards and cornfields. Then, in July 1890, two months after leaving the asylum, he shot himself in the stomach in Auvers, north-west of Paris. He chose to do it in the summer wheatfields — the landscape he had just been painting so memorably. Two days later, he died in the Auberge Ravoux, the inn where he was lodging. Biographers still debate the exact causes of Van Gogh’s acute mental condition. Some say it was syphilis, which can induce symptoms of madness, others that it was manic depression or schizophrenia. Whatever the cause, Van Gogh’s mental decline was certainly exacerbated by absinthe, acute anxiety, poverty and malnutrition. But through this fog of madness, Van Gogh produced some of the most extraordinary paintings the world has ever seen. What is more remarkable still, is that these masterpieces came about quite by chance. One hot, breathless August day in Arles, the models Van Gogh had engaged to sit for him failed to turn up and it was too stifling to  consider taking his easel outside. So he cast his eye around the Yellow House for inspiration. Seizing a handful of sunflowers, already wilting and curling in the heat, he arranged the blooms haphazardly in several green, cream and yellow earthenware pots. Martin Bailey imagines that the pots might have been just the sort of thing Van Gogh would have ready in his studio as ‘the ideal thing to put paintbrushes in’. So, with his peasant pots and dying sunflowers, Van Gogh produced seven paintings of astonishing  brilliance. Now, thanks to a British scholar’s rediscovery of an image of Van Gogh’s lost masterpiece, we are once again able to admire them in all their end-of-summer glory. n The Sunflowers Are Mine — The Story Of Van Gogh’s Masterpiece by Martin Bailey (Frances Lincoln, £25).","Seven different versions of the paintings of sunflowers in a vase .

A Philadelphia, PA man with a taste for prostitutes was brutally killed last week by two he often met, as well as their pimp, according to police. Francis Zarzycki, 40, was tasered, suffocated to death and chopped to pieces with an axe August 26 by Keith Tolbert, Angel Weston. 21, and Stephanie Foulke, 22, before they wrapped his torso in a plastic bag and dumped it in a local river, a police spokesperson told MailOnline. The torso was found floating in the river without a head, arms or legs, the spokesperson said. He has priors: Keith Tolbert, 34, has been accused of beheading and dismembering Francis Zarzycki, he has two prior arrests . Accused pimp: Mr Tolbert is no stranger to Philadelphia Police, they even published a mug shot from one of his prior arrests shortly after apprehending him . Mr Tolbert, 34, an alleged pimp, is accused of trying to rob Mr Zarzycki while he was in the middle of a tryst with the two hookers - who went by the names Angel and Cinderella - in a designated apartment in Center City, Philadelphia, according to reports. ‘He frequents there. He's been there before and I think they came up with the plan knowing he was coming there,’ Captain James Clark of Philadelphia Police said during a Thursday press conference. When the robbery didn’t go as planned, both women subdued Mr Zarzycki while the pimp shot him with a taser before suffocating him to death, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The brutal killing started in the living room before moving into the bathroom, according to officials. Mr Tolbert is believed to have dragged Mr Zarzycki’s body to the bathroom, where he beheaded the dead John before hacking off his arms and legs in the bathtub with an axe or a hatchet, the paper said. ‘He comes there, he starts to deal with the two young ladies and then the male, Tolbert, comes back from another room and a struggle ensues,’ said Mr Clark. ‘At some point, they have a taser, he’s beaten, and he’s suffocated,’ he added. A taste for prostitutes: Francis Zarzycki was known to frequent hookers, their familiarity with him led to planning the botched robbery . Helpers: Alleged prostitutes Angel Weston (left) and Stephanie Foulke (right) are accused of helping Mr Tolbert carry out the brutal murder . A family devastated: Francis Zarzycki's parents searched in vein for their son, even handing out missing posters offering a reward . Investigators have yet to find the axe, Zarzycki’s head, arms or legs, the spokesperson told MailOnline. There is surveillance video of him entering the apartment building where he was killed, according to reports. Mr Zarzycki, a loan officer, was reported missing by his family shortly after he disappeared, according to WPVI. Police were able to trace him to the apartment, a front for prostitution, through his cell phone records and by accessing his computer, reported the station. They discovered visits to the notorious Backpage.com and calls to an unknown phone number, according to the Inquirer. Backpage is known for having ads for prostitutes. Bordello of blood: The trio allegedly tasered, suffocated and hacked Mr Zarzycki to death in a second-floor apartment in this Center City, Philadelphia building . Watery grave: Zarzycki's beheaded, limbless body was found in the Schuylkill River, which winds it's way down the eastern border Philadelphia shares with New Jersey . The mutilated corpse was discovered floating in the Schuylkill River Tuesday morning by a fisherman, and was able to be identified because of a tattoo across his upper back, according to KYW. The tattoo was of wings and a bull, according to the Inquirer. Mr Zarzycki lived with his parents, who spent days searching for him and handing out missing posters offering a reward, according to reports. Detectives removed large sections of . drain pipe believed to contain Mr Zarzycki’s blood as well as pieces of . his flesh, reports said. Mr Tolbert's neighbors had mixed reactions. Wrecking crew: Investigators tore apart the apartment looking for evidence . Evidence: Police removed several sections of pipe believed to contain Zarzycki's blood, flesh and other DNA . 'He had lots of girls running in and out of there,' Joan Taylor, 65, told the Inquirer while sitting on couch against a wall she shared with Mr Tolbert. 'They looked like crackheads.' Telling WPVI that she was shaken and wanted to move because she no longer felt safe in the area, Kafi Roundtree said she never heard a struggle, but did hear music. 'I just thought it was a neighborly party,' she added, 'I didn't think it was anything serious.' Both Mr Tolbert and Ms Weston have prior criminal histories, but the spokesperson declined to comment further, saying the department does not divulge such information. All three suspects have been charged with murder, robbery and related offenses, and are being held while awaiting trial, the spokesperson told MailOnline.","Francis Zarzycki was allegedly killed by two prostitutes he visited often .

Two teenagers who called 911 after they saw a kidnap victim pleading for help from inside a car today recounted the harrowing chase - and how they feared for their lives when the alleged kidnapper saw them. Jamal Harris, 17, was a passenger in 19-year-old Aaron Arias's car when he looked over at another vehicle at a stoplight and spotted a blonde woman in the backseat who he thought was cute. But when he took a closer look, he realized something was seriously wrong - she was mouthing, 'Help me!' This simple glance led to a 12-minute car chase, a frantic 911 call and the arrest of Charles Atkins Lewis Jr., who had allegedly forced the 25-year-old woman into her own car at gunpoint in Dallas. Heroes: Aaron Arias, left, and Jamal Harris, right, have spoken out about the moment they saw a woman in distress in the back of a car and called police, who saved her. She had allegedly been kidnapped . Speaking on CNN's New Day on Friday, the heroic teens explained that they were driving through Seagoville as they went to collect a friend from work when Harris spotted the woman in the car. 'I was looking at her thinking, ""She's pretty beautiful"",' Harris said, adding that he was trying to get his friend to look at her too. 'But I could tell from her facial expression that what she was telling me was very serious... She was mouthing ""Help me"".' He told Arias what he was seeing but the friend was skeptical and said he needed to focus on driving. But Arias also became suspicious when the light switched to green and the car took off too fast. Saved: A dashcam image shows a woman being helped by police after two teenagers saw her mouthing 'help me' through her car window. She had allegedly been kidnapped that evening . Then he saw the woman hitting the back . window to get their attention - so decided to follow them. They called . 911 and frantically recounted what they had witnessed. Arrest: Charles Atkins Lewis Jr. allegedly kidnapped the woman from outside an office block . 'I'm on the highway,' Arias tells the . Kaufman County Sheriff's Office dispatcher in the recording, which was . released earlier this week. 'I'm witnessing . a robbery; not a robbery - a kidnapping. 'It's me and another guy, so we're . checking out the girl in the backseat because we're like, ""OK, she's . kind of attractive"",' Arias told the operator in the dramatic call. And then, all of the sudden the guy is turned back, looking at us.' Although . both the teenagers said they would 'obviously' do the same again, they . admitted they began to feel more nervous towards the end of the chase. 'Close . to the end, he was slowing down and I was slowing down - he knew he was . being followed,' Arias said. 'He could've done something to her or us.' Officers were on the scene minutes later and pulled the car over. Dashcam footage, which was also . released to NBC5, shows the woman being taken to safety by police . officers. 'Thank God. You guys are awesome,' Arias . told the dispatcher as police arrived on the scene. 'Oh my God. Oh my . God. Get him! Oh my God.' Lucky: They were driving to collect a friend when they stopped at a light and looked over to see the woman . Chase: Arias and Harris followed the car for 12 minutes until police arrived and arrested the alleged kidnapper . Little did the teenagers know the . extent of the alleged kidnapping; NBC5 reported that police found a gun . and knife inside the car when they apprehended her alleged captor, Charles Atkins Lewis Jr. The woman had been kidnapped late on August 25 as she left a downtown Dallas office building. Lewis allegedly smacked her across the head with a pistol and forced her into her own car. He drove off and a few minutes later, he threw her cell phone from the window of the moving car. They . were eventually stopped by police officers nearly 40 miles away in . Kaufman. Arias, a 19-year-old Texas A&M freshman, followed them . there with the dispatcher on the phone. The woman was checked by paramedics but was not hurt. Arias said he met her after the rescue and she gave him a hug. Scene: She was snatched from this downtown block in Dallas on August 15 and forced into her own car. Lewis allegedly drove for more than 30 miles with her captive before he was pulled over by police . 'I would describe it as the best hug I have ever gotten,' he told NBC. Asked . if he considered himself a hero, he said: 'She says we saved her life. I . guess you could say we did. But I don't want to be that person who says . they're a hero.'

George Zimmerman's wife today lambasted her husband as 'selfish' and said he believes he is invincible since being acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin last year. Speaking in an exclusive television interview revealing why she has filed for divorce, Shellie Zimmerman said her husband was forever changed by the fame that came with the high-profile case. 'In my opinion, he feels more invincible' since the court case, the 26-year-old said in the interview with Good Morning America on Friday. 'I think he's just making some reckless decisions.' George Zimmerman, 29, made headlines again this week after he was caught speeding - the second time since he was acquitted of second-degree murder in July. Scroll down for video . Anger: Shellie Zimmerman spoke out about her divorce from George Zimmerman on Friday morning and said he now believes he is invincible since being acquitted of second-degree murder . The couple, who have been married nearly seven years, separated August 13 - a month after he was found not guilty - and she filed for divorce on the grounds that their marriage is 'irretrievably broken'. 'I have a selfish husband,' she said. 'I think George is all about George.' She said that he developed a temper and 'beat her down' - while she remained by his side during the lengthy trial that sent them both into hiding . when George became a symbol of racial tension. 'I stood by my husband through everything . and I feel like he left me with a bunch of pieces of broken glass that . I'm supposed to now assemble and make a life,' she told Good Morning America. 'I have supported him for so long and . neglected myself for too long and I feel like I'm finally starting to . feel empowered again.' By his side: She said she remained supportive of George Zimmerman (pictured at Seminole circuit court in Sanford, Florida in June) but he beat her down and shattered her self esteem . She is now wanting custody of their dogs - a Rottweiller named Oso and a mixed breed named Leroy - and a share of the money he gets from a lawsuit against NBC. It was also revealed this week that she is reaping more than $4,000-a-month from his defense fund despite splitting from him weeks after he was cleared. Shellie Zimmerman . TMZ revealed on Thursday that she is collecting the $4,300 stipend to cover her 'living expenses'. Zimmerman had raised some $300,000 to be used for his 'ongoing living expenses, legal costs, and fees for this matter', according to the solicitation on PayPal. More confusing still, his legal . defense website says: 'Currently George and Shellie are renting a secure . residence at a reasonable rate. Their day-to-day living expenses are . relatively modest as they want to preserve as many funds as possible for . an aggressive defense.'

Shellie, . 26, also spoke to Good Morning America and told how the death threats that . he husband received following Trayvon's slaying forced them to live 'pretty much Gypsies for . the past year'. 'We lived in a 20-foot trailer in the woods, scared every night that someone would find us and it would be horrific,' she said in the interview which aired on August 28. She appeared at every court hearing for him before he was acquitted of second degree murder.

"By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:21 EST, 6 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:57 EST, 6 September 2013 . A monster blaze that has blackened an area larger than Dallas in the rugged northern California forests in and around Yosemite National Park started from an illegal campfire a hunter built and let grow out of control, fire managers said on Thursday. The precise origins of the so-called Rim Fire, which erupted nearly three weeks ago in the Stanislaus National Forest west of Yosemite, remained under investigation, and no arrests have been made, the U.S. Forest Service said. But the campfire that sparked the conflagration, now the fourth-largest California blaze on record, was built in defiance of Forest Service restrictions imposed at the time due to dangerously hot, dry conditions in the area, officials said. The spark that started the fire: The U.S. Forest Service announced yesterday that the Rim Fire burning in northern California was started by a hunter's illegal campfire . Consequences: Whether or not the unnamed hunter will face criminal charges depends on the level of carelessness determined by investigators . The official cause: It was originally reported that an illegal marijuana farm could be to blame, when a firefighter chief made the statement at a community meeting . Whether the hunter deemed to be the culprit will face criminal charges depends on a variety of factors, including the degree of carelessness or neglect determined by investigators, said Forest Service spokesman Ray Mooney . Beyond saying the fire began 'when a hunter allowed an illegal fire to escape,' authorities declined to comment on evidence linking the hunter to the blaze. The individual has not been publicly identified. The Rim Fire, named for a popular local lookout spot called Rim of the World, has charred more than 237,000 acres, or 370 square miles (958 square kilometers), of timber and chaparral since it erupted August 17 in an area known as Jawbone Ridge in a remote corner of the national forest. Almost under control: The wildfire - which has torched an area larger than Dallas, Texas - is currently 80 per cent contained . Still fighting: But containment could change due to gusty winds. Firefighters expect the wildfire to continue burning for a few more weeks . Firefighting costs there have run $81million to date, with some 5,000 personnel assigned to battle the blaze at its peak. With a footprint bigger than the land mass of Dallas, Texas, the blaze ranks as the largest of dozens of wildfires that have raged across several states in the drought-parched West this year, straining U.S. firefighting resources. Dozens of homes and cabins near Yosemite have been destroyed and nearly 2,500 dwellings in the region were still threatened by the blaze on Thursday. But no serious injuries have been reported, and most evacuation orders have been lifted as firefighters tightened their grip on the flames. As of Thursday, ground crews armed with hand tools and chainsaws, and backed by bulldozers, water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers with payloads of chemical retardant, had cut containment lines around 80 per cent of the fire's perimeter. Beginnings: The fire broke out August 17 in a remote area of Stanislaus National Forest near Jawbone ridge . Rapid fire: The fire eventually spread to nearby Yosemite National Park - threatening ancient giant sequoias and San Francisco's power and drinking water . Smoky haze: Smoke was noticeable in Reno at the end of August, and traces of smoke was found in the air as far away as Europe . But fire managers say they expect the blaze to continue burning for several more weeks, and warned that a resumption of gusty winds 'could challenge containment lines.' Less than a third of the total burned acreage lies inside Yosemite, and firefighters there have succeeded in limiting most of the damage to wilderness and back-country areas in the park's remote northwestern corner. Several campgrounds, numerous trails and one of the four main entrances to the park have been closed by the fire. But the most popular portions have remained open to the public, including the scenic Yosemite Valley area famed for its towering granite rock formations, waterfalls and meadows. Nevertheless, park officials say droves of visitors who typically crowd Yosemite in late summer have noticeably diminished. And Yosemite-area businesses say the region's tourist economy has been hit hard a year after an outbreak of hantavirus in the park frightened away many park visitors. The wake of destruction: The fire torched make popular camps like the Berkeley Tuolumne Camp near Groveland, above . The hunter: Authorities say the hunter had to connection to illegal marijuana cultivation . Word that investigators had traced the fire's origins to a hunter's campfire came a day after authorities ruled out the possibility that the Rim Fire somehow began from an illegal marijuana cultivation site in the national forest. Speculation that a pot farm might be to blame grew out of videotaped comments made by a local fire department chief during an August 23 community meeting, but fire officials again denied any such connection to the blaze, or to the hunter in question. 'There is no indication the hunter was involved with illegal marijuana cultivation on public lands and no marijuana cultivation sites were located near the origin of the fire,' the Forest Service said in its statement.","The U.S. Forest service announced Thursday that the Rim Fire in northern California was started by a hunter's illegal campfire that grew out of control .

We return to Downton Abbey in the dead of night, six months after the death of Matthew Crawley. The honeyed stone of the great house is sheathed in velvety darkness. Only a single bedroom light glows, high up near the eaves. A shadow moves across the window. Whassat noise? A baby crying? A bat? Mrs Patmore strangling a pheasant for lunch? There’s no way of telling. The walls of Downton must keep their secrets just that agonising bit longer. Dancing into Downton: Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern are set to return to TV screens this week . Widowed: Michelle Dockery will return as Lady Mary but how will she cope with Matthew's demise? For yes, the fourth series of Downton Abbey is almost here. This year it will be accompanied by the brilliant new book Behind The Scenes At Downton Abbey, a fascinating insight into the making of our favourite TV show, and serialised here exclusively. Some of the chapters give a tantalising insight into what promises to be another classic series, although to be honest I’m not sure if I’ve recovered from the trauma of our last visit to Downton – the tear-stained Christmas special that ended with the death of Matthew Crawley. A crumpled fender, a trickle of raspberry jam running down his noble brow, a man cut down in his prime after surviving the war, the convenient death of his fiancée Lavinia Swire and the curious incident of the Trouser Tingle? Nobody saw that coming. What exactly happened? Your guess is as good as mine. All that was clear was Matthew lying at the side of the road, gone forever. The episode ended with Mary holding her baby, unaware her husband was dead. As Christmas downers go, it was right up there with Santa Claus not coming to town. In the new series we find out all that’s left of Matthew is a photograph in a frame, glinting in the lamplight on Lady Mary’s dressing table. A photograph – and an heir, of course. A proper male heir, unaware of his future inheritance as lord of Downton and all he surveys. Good for him – but how is everyone else coping? Mary, of course, is still in mourning. Brother-in-law Tom Branson will be a comfort, for he’s been through a similar bereavement with the death of his wife, Lady Sybil, in series three. Not too much of a comfort, perhaps, as before long keen admirers will no doubt be crunching up the gravel drive. Meanwhile Lord and Lady Grantham continue to flourish despite all that’s happened. That unpleasant affair with Pamuk the Turk. O’Brien and The Inexplicable Soap Incident. The mysterious cousin who may or may not have survived the Titanic. Those wrinkles have been smoothed over, like the newspapers ironed each morning for his lordship’s perusal. Waspish: Jan is looking forward to more sharp-tongued comments from the Dowager Countess . Setting: The spectacular Highclere Castle is once again the backdrop for Downton Abbey drama . Dowager Countess Violet – played by Dame Maggie Smith – continues to stalk the corridors of Downton with her silver-topped cane, looking for people to argue with. In this series, she finds herself with a new sparring partner. Her old school chum Lady Shackleton (Dame Harriet Walter) is one of the few who is not intimidated by waspish Violet. Doubled-headed dame disputes? We can expect some delicious clashes. Elsewhere, Downton is in flux. We are in 1922, but it’s not quite the Roaring 20s, not yet. However, the pall of war has been left behind. The world is changing – but some characters are keener than others to embrace the exciting new developments. In this, Lady Edith leads the way. She is almost unrecognisable from the dowdy frump of series one, seduced by a different life in London and her relationship with Michael Gregson, her delectable editor at The Sketch. In one scene in the opening episode, she has dinner with him at the Criterion, a big step for a woman whose mother once told her she was never to eat in public. Now here she is drinking champagne from a saucer glass and flirting with an older man. Downton is moving into the Jazz Age in more ways than one. Gary Carr plays Jack Ross, the drama’s first black character, a jazz singer who performs with his band at a party at the house. He then becomes embroiled with the Crawleys in unexpected ways – particularly with the wilful Lady Rose MacClare. Coping with motherhood: The last episode ended with Mary holding her baby, unaware her husband was dead . Downstairs there’s a new boot room where the servants can gossip and plot without being overheard. Carson and Mrs Hughes are still locked in a dysfunctional relationship, and all the old favourites are there, too. The Downton producers have promised there will be fewer departures and deaths in this series. Thank heavens for that – how much more could we take? They also promise a few guest appearances, including one from Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, who stars as opera singer Dame Nellie Melba. So this is what we know. Empires might rise and fall, wars begin and end, but the Crawleys have maintained their position in the social order. Yes, the Marcel wave and the dropped waist may have come to Downton, but some traditions will never change. As the curtain rises on series four, the family still dress for dinner and sit down to snipe and bicker over Mrs Patmore’s pigeons stuffed with cherries. And that is just the way we like it.","Jan is looking forward to catching up with events at the Abbey .

Jo and her husband, Gavin - who is also her athletics coach - already have a son, Jacob, three. Mother again: Jo Pavey has given birth to a daughter, a sister for her son Jacob . New arrival: Jo Tweeted their happy news this morning . Female marathon world record holder, . Paula Radcliffe, was among those to congratulate the couple on their new . arrival via Twitter. Jo, from Devon, is a Commonwealth and European silver medallist over 5k and 10k respectively and has represented Great Britain at four Olympic Games (Sydney, Athens, Beijing and London). Last year at the home games she was the first European in the 5k and 10k, finishing both races in 7th place and setting a personal best time in the 10k of 30.53. She had also achieved the qualifying time for the marathon after running a pb of 2.28 in New York in 2011. Jo will turn 40 this month and when she announced she was expecting her second child, she said she had no intention of retiring from the international running scene. She hopes to return to form in time to compete in the European Championships in 2014 and then the Rio Olympics in 2016. Far from retirement: Jo takes son Jacob on a run with her when he was younger. She said having children has boosted her motivation to run at international level . Team GB regular: The distance runner has been to four Olympics and hopes to make a fifth at Rio . She said: 'It will be very special if I can make the Rio Games. I'll be getting older, but have been very encouraged to continue after running a pb in the 10k at the London Olympics.' Jo continued to run throughout her pregnancy - at a much lower intensity than usual - and blogged about her progress. She wrote: 'My volume has dropped from over 100 miles per week down to 20 or so miles per week. The pace I'm running at has significantly fallen too. I wear a heart rate monitor and keep below about 140 beats per minute. I'm not actually interested in running fast, it's about running a safe pace.' She added that she always listened to her body and put her baby first - never running if she felt too tired. She also said she kept 'very busy with conditioning work to help make the post pregnancy return to running go as smoothly as possible.' Athletes are recommended to have at least six to eight weeks rest after giving birth before returning gradually to training. Cut back on training: Jo ran throughout her pregnancy but listened to her body and always put her baby first . With advice from top physios on hand and under the watchful eye of her husband, Jo said she will ease back into training sensibly to avoid injury and allow her to enjoy being a new mother again. She said: 'My long career has probably been made possible by building my training very slowly and carefully but also because my coach sets schedules that closely correlate to the level of conditioning completed.' She added: 'Some people have been surprised that I . have the motivation to want to continue running at international level . but you are a long time retired and I simply love running. Ironically it . also gives me more time with my family as I essentially work from home.' The Olympian said motherhood has increased her desire to do well in sport as well as lead a 'balanced' life. She said: 'Having Jacob has boosted my motivation and underpins my continued enjoyment of the sport. He really has helped to give me a balanced life. When everything is very tense or serious you can count on a three year old to lighten things up!'","Distance runner announced arrival of daughter Emily .

When Jack and Amanda got married ten years ago, their friends and families joked that they were joined at the hip. 'We spent every free minute with each other,' Amanda told me. 'We'd go for long walks and cook supper. We loved the cinema, entertaining friends, adventurous holidays - and we had a great sex life.' But by the time Jack, 42, and Amanda, 41, came to see me for marital advice earlier this year, their pleasure in one another was a distant memory. It all changed when their children came along - daughter Emily, now eight, and their son, Tom, six. The couple admitted they had slept together only a handful of times since Tom's birth, had almost stopped talking to each other - and were at breaking point. Who's the boss? Always putting your child's needs first can ruin your marriage says a therapist (posed by models) With their children now 'the centre of their lives', as they both proudly described it, they had moved out of London to a bigger house with a family-size garden. As a result, Jack was spending long hours commuting, while the couple's free time was dominated by Emily and Tom's needs and even their social lives. 'We just want the best for them,' explained Amanda. 'Like all their friends, our two have after-school clubs most evenings. I spend much of my time ferrying the children to and from school, piano lessons, dance classes and tutors. They have swimming on a Saturday morning, and birthday parties in the afternoon and on Sunday. If we do have any free time left at the weekend, I make sure we do things the kids enjoy.' 'With the children hanging on to me and calling for me all the time, I just don't have the energy to ask Jack about his day at work, let alone have sex with him' That left Jack either falling asleep in front of the television after a long day at work or trying to be a 'good dad' by playing games with the children, with Amanda feeling ignored and under-valued at home as she struggled through the monotonous grind of cooking, cleaning and servicing the family's needs. 'With the children hanging on to me and calling for me all the time, I just don't have the energy to ask Jack about his day at work, let alone have sex with him.' Jack too, was deeply unhappy, insisting he was the very last of Amanda's priorities, beneath the children, housework, shopping and the family dog. 'Sometimes I wish Amanda and I could have some days to ourselves, when we don't follow the kids' timetable,' he said. 'It would be nice to go out as a couple, but the kids make such a fuss about being left with babysitters that we can't relax.' Worst of all, he confessed he and Amanda no longer slept in the same bed. 'The children have got into the habit of sleeping in our bed with Amanda, so it's just easier if I sleep in the spare room because I have to get up so early.' Marriage killer: Many parents don't want to acknowledge how overindulging their child has placed a wedge between them (posed by models) As a marital therapist, I have spent almost 30 years helping couples turn around their relationships and fall back in love again. I've written 11 books on the subject, answered countless letters to my website, given talks and appeared on numerous radio and TV shows. And it seems to me one fundamental issue is driving so much of the misery I encounter now: how to stop your children ruining your marriage. I know from experience that most parents don't want to hear my message. When they are giving their all to their children, they don't want to think they might ironically be creating the wedge that will eventually force them apart. But 'red carpet' kids, as I call them, are an increasingly common phenomenon. 'Prioritise your child's football practice over household chores and everyone else's activities, and you send the message that they are all-important' I've given them this nickname because, like mini-celebrities, who are cared for and indulged to the detriment of everyone else in the family. If you're not careful, they can kill your marriage stone dead. So why do we do we spoil our children like this? Firstly, it makes life easier in the short-term. Jack and Amanda let their children sleep in their bed because a peaceful night in the spare room is easier than a full-on fight at bedtime. Parental guilt also plays a part. There are any number of reasons for modern parents to feel guilty: not spending enough time with their children, not being able to afford everything their children want or need, losing their temper because they're stressed, not feeling 'good enough'... Children target adult guilt to get what they want. And finally, we all want to be liked. Too many parents are so fearful of upsetting their children and losing their 'friendship', they struggle to discipline them effectively. Survival guide: Andrew G Marshall has written a book on how to childproof your marriage . The long-term consequences of all this are just as disastrous for the child as the parents' relationship. Prioritise your child's football practice over household chores and everyone else's activities, and you send the message that they are all-important. Too important, even. Letting your child choose what you all eat, where you go and even their own bedtime sounds like every child's dream – but you are effectively making them 'head of the household'. Children who regularly wield this power at home struggle to make friends in the outside world as they haven't learned how to negotiate with, or defer to, others. Nearing adulthood once meant new privileges and freedoms. But today's red-carpet children, who already have everything they could wish for and rarely hear the word no? They end up reluctant to leave home. A lot of parents are so busy taking photographs and applauding as their children walk the metaphorical 'red carpet', they don’t see the problems they are creating until devastation is upon them. Don't let that be you. As I explained to Amanda and Jack, change is always possible. Just because something has been done one way until now doesn't mean it must continue. By learning to apply some of my very simple rules for family harmony, Amanda and Jack were able to improve their relationships with each other and their children beyond all recognition. So start rolling up the red carpet, and get your family and your marriage back on track too. 1.  Put your children last. Prioritising . your partner over your children is good for your marriage and your . kids. Of course, there will be exceptions – if the children are ill, or . their first day at school and so on, but otherwise make sure you and . your partner go out for dinner together, send the kids to bed early, do . things the two of you love to do together. A happy marriage makes happy . children. 2. Be a 'good enough' parent. Accept . you're not perfect, that every parent makes mistakes and it's not the . end of the world if you send your child to school in a hastily . cobbled-together costume for the school play. 3. Recognise Your Needs. I . have met many mothers and fathers who, after years of downgrading their . own needs, felt 'entitled to do something for myself for once' - and . had an affair. Always putting your children first can cause resentment . to rebound in extraordinary acts of selfishness. Have a good think about . what YOU want and need in your relationship and family life – and make . sure you get it. 4. Talk. Make . sure you talk through your problems – don't silently hope they'll go . away. Problems fester if you don’t get them out in the open. 5. Put a lock on your bedroom door. You . wouldn't barge into a teenager's bedroom unannounced, so don't let your . children do it to you. Give yourself some privacy as a couple – they . can always shout 'Fire!' if they're in trouble. 6.  Greet your partner first when he or she walks through the door – not your children. It shows how important they are to you. 7.  Don't let your children interrupt when you are talking to each other. 8. Make unilateral decisions about your children. Parent as a team and don't compete for popularity with your children. 9. Prioritise sex. Intimacy keeps a relationship alive. Send the children to the grandparents for the night. It's important. 10. Make the children responsible for tasks around the house, so there's more time for you to be partners rather than servants.

A paedophile pardoned by the king of Morocco after being convicted of raping 11 children has been re-arrested, this time in Spain. Daniel Galvan Vina, who was serving a 30-year sentence, was held in the Spanish city of Murcia and will appear before the National Court in Madrid. Galvan was on a list of 30 Spanish prisoners in Morocco that Madrid had asked to be transferred to Spain. Morocco included him among 48 Spanish prisoners pardoned and freed in late July. Scroll down for video . King's deal: The convicted paedophile is among 48 . jailed Spaniards who were pardoned by King Mohamed VI, right, on Tuesday at the . request of Spain's King Juan Carlos, left, who visited Morocco last month . Morocco's king later withdrew the . pardon after a spate of protests - the first time in recent memory that a . sovereign has done so. King Mohammed VI said he had asked . his justice minister to work with his Spanish counterpart to see how the . pardon could be undone in what he described as 'an exceptional . reversal'. He also ordered an investigation into the pardons process. The decision was made 'considering . the flaws that marred the process, the gravity of the crimes committed . and with respect to the rights of the victims', he said. Outraged Moroccans are expected to protest in Rabat, the kingdom's capital, tomorrow . Hundreds of peaceful demonstrators gathered on Friday to rally against the pardon, in a rare protest against the king. The demonstration was broken up by police with clubs, leaving at least 63 people injured. The decision also prompted a frenzy . of angry postings on social media in Morocco. Activists from the . February 20 movement also called for Friday's rally in the Moroccan . capital. 'The king's pardon is a second rape for the victims,' a woman identifying herself as Meryem El said on Twitter. Hamid . Krayri, a lawyer for families of the victims, named the paedophile as . Daniel Fino Galvan and said he had been convicted 18 months ago by . criminal courts in Kenitra, near Rabat, of raping and filming children . aged between 4 and 15. 'He . is a retired Spaniard who owns two flats here in Kenitra,' Krayri, who . is a member of Morocco's Human Rights Association, told Reuters. He said . he had filed a complaint against Galvan three years ago when activists . had shown him video discs containing footage of the Spaniard and his . victims. Galvan's lawyer, Mohamed Benjeddo, said his client had been freed on Wednesday and planned to leave for Spain the next day. The Spanish embassy declined to confirm Galvan's release. The palace and the government made no immediate comment. The king, like other Middle Eastern rulers, often pardons prisoners on special occasions, such as Throne Day on July 30, but the decision to release the Spaniards at the request of the monarch of a former colonial power has riled many in Morocco. 'Is this Morocco's way to reach the long-sought target of 10 million tourists a year?' asked blogger Nouhad Fathi in a sarcastic post on her Facebook wall.","Daniel Fino Galvan raped and filmed 11 children, aged 4 to 15, in Kenitra .

A federal agent charged with killing a man inside a McDonald's restaurant in Hawaii was released from police custody today after posting $250,000 bail. Special agent Christopher Deedy, 27, is accused of fatally shooting . 23-year-old Kollin Elderts in the chest during a confrontation in the early hours of . Saturday in Waikiki. An official spokesman for the Department . of State confirmed to MailOnline today that Deedy was in Hawaii to protect . U.S. dignitaries at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which will be attended by President Obama and the First Lady at the weekend. Suspect: State Department special agent and shooting suspect Christopher Deedy stares blankly in this booking photo provided by the Honolulu Police Department . Deedy, who is attached to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, was charged with second-degree murder and using a firearm in the commission of a felony. Honolulu police said Deedy was released from jail at 5:15 am this morning. His first court appearance is scheduled for November 17. Police spokesman Carolyn Sluyter said Mr Elderts, Deedy and two other men were involved in a confrontation at the restaurant when the shooting occurred after an earlier altercation at a nightclub. Shooting: Christopher Deedy (left) has been charged in a shooting in Hawaii that left Kollin Elderts dead (right) Mr Elderts suffered a gunshot wound and was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Deedy was arrested at the scene, Ms Sluyter said. She did not identify the other two men. Michael Green, an attorney for Mr . Elderts' family, said the victim and Deedy didn't know each other and . that Mr Elderts was unarmed. Confrontation: The fatal shooting took place inside this McDonald's at 3am on Saturday morning in Waikiki . The shooting comes as security is ramped up in the area for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which starts tomorrow. It was not immediately known who Deedy's attorney is. President Obama and the First Lady are due to travel to Honolulu at the weekend for the APEC summit. Mr Eldert's family have hired attorney Michael Green who claims that Deedy followed the victim to the McDonald's at 3am. The lawyer said the victim 'was in a club and got . into a beef with a guy who turned out to be a federal agent. The guy . followed him (Elderts) to McDonald's and shot him once in the chest'. Mr Green did not know the name of the nightclub. He added: 'Nothing good happens at three o'clock.' Out of control: A U.S. federal agent has been charged with second-degree murder after a man was shot in the chest at a McDonald's . Mr Green told Hawaii News Now: ‘If you have a group of people, including this agent, at a bar or club, what’s the likelihood of all of them winding up at this McDonald’s shortly after that, before the club is closed? Someone apparently followed someone.’ He added: ‘He’s an agent of the federal government and my guess is he’s on duty 24 hours, just like our Honolulu Police Department people are. ‘And so there are some issues involved and there are some legal questions that have to be answered.’ The attorney said that a blood alcohol test was likely to take place. 'We can't wait to see those test results,' he added. Mr Green said he was in the process of tracking any surveillance videos from the McDonald’s and surrounding businesses. Mr Elderts, 23, was a graduate of Kalaheo High School in Kailua. His criminal record consisted of a 2008 disorderly conduct violation, for which he was ordered to pay $150 and a 2010 petty misdemeanor for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, for which he paid a $300 fine.","The accused posted $250,000 bail this morning .

Tweets could be used to spot riots before they break out, using a new computer programme that analyses public mood. The Emotive software can process up to 2,000 tweets a second and boil each one down to eight basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, surprise, sadness, shame and confusion. Designers said it could be used on a mass scale to evaluate crowd emotions, alert police to potential criminals or public safety threats, and even guide national policy on dealing with major incidents. They said it could be used to create a geographical map of the national mood. While it currently focuses on the UK, it could be expanded to monitor the 10,000 tweets that are sent out every second worldwide from Twitter's hundreds of millions of users. Academics said they were also exploring ways of creating personality profiles from the language individuals used on Twitter and similar social streams. Together with Facebook and BlackBerry Messenger, Twitter has proved a useful aid to rioters, such as those involved in the violent attacks that swept England - and particularly London - in the summer of 2011. Twitter already groups and flags up 'trends' on the site - topics that many users are tweeting about at a given time. Professor Tom Jackson, who led the team from Loughborough University who developed the programme, said: 'Following the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich there was an outpouring of sadness and disgust through Twitter. Emotions: Twitter was a major organisational aid for people involved in riots in London in August 2011 . 'Across the country people expressed their emotions at this unprovoked attack, with some using the incident to incite racial hatred against Muslims. 'Two days after his murder his family appealed for calm, stating that their son would not have wanted his name to be used as an excuse to carry out attacks against others. 'This appeal had an almost immediate effect, leading to an outpour of positive sentiment.' He said that public postings through social media give an accurate real-time record of how and what people are feeling. 'Twitter is a very concise platform through which users express how they feel about a particular event, be that a criminal act, a new government policy or even a change in the weather,' he said. 'Through the computer program we have created we can collate these expressions of feelings in real time, map them geographically and track how they develop.' Dr Ann O'Brien, who was part of the research team that created the structural model used by Emotive, said: 'The ontology (structural model) we created takes the eight emotions and gives them a rich linguistic context so that we can chart the strength of emotions expressed in ordinary language and also in slang. For any incident we can view how reactions grow and diminish over time.' Mass mood: The Emotive software is said to provide a geographical map of social network users' emotions . The team has already secured further funding that will enable researchers to develop another prototype system that can automatically detect events, analyse emotions and extract more summary details from social media. The Emotive project was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.","Emotive software maps 'moods' of tweets in geographical area .

The top prediction saw 34 per cent believe at least one country to leave the EU next year. But this time last year in the same survey, 47 per cent had said this too and were wrong. But their crystal ball-gazing should not be mocked as, 12 months ago, they also got plenty right, include Kate Middleton's pregnancy and Facebook shares going public.

Despite the current icy weather and a couple of years of washout summers, 10 per cent still predict next year will see a heatwave. Andy Murray's success at the Olympics and US Open have convinced 14 per cent he'll win Wimbledon at last and 15 per cent think the Beckhams are coming back to the UK for good.

With his short-lived dalliances with women and the fact that he spends most of his time with a muscular male sidekick, Marco Mancassola writes that he was in fact in a relationship with Robin. Speculation over Batman's sexuality has been rife among comic book fans for decades and in Erotic Lives of the Superheroes, Mancassola writes about batman's penchant for one night stands and 'extreme' sex after the spark between the couple dwindles. Extreme: The Italian author's book imagines Batman as an ageing homosexual . 'Batman has always had a very dark side,' Mr Mancassola told The Independent. 'And it shouldn't be a shock that my version of this character indulges in weird forms of fetishism and extreme sex. The author, who said narcissism was Batman's 'inner abyss', added: 'He let his only real love story miserably fail because he is in love with the mystery of youth - that inaccessible fleeting kind of spirit that he sees in the eyes of his young male and female pick-ups.' The book also explores the personal . lives of Batman's DC Comics colleagues Superman, Mister Fantastic and . Mystique in New York in the early 21st Century. The . author said he had no intention of offending anybody with his portrayal . of Batman in his book, which has been well-received by critics. Heroes: As well as Batman, left, Erotic Lives of the Superheroes also features Superman, Mister Fanastic and Mystique . Homo-erotic: George Clooney, who played the caped crusader in the 1997 film Batman and Robin, has said he intended to portray Batman as gay . The homo-erotic elements of Batman's . adventures with Robin have not escaped the attention of fans in the . past, with Grant Morrison, who has written Batman stories for DC Comics, declaring: 'He's intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay'. In 2006 DC Comics reinvented Batwoman as a lesbian. Marco Mancassola was born in Northern Italy in 1973 and lives in London. The book is available now through Salammbo Press for £14.99. Ever since Batman first began fighting crime on the mean streets of Gotham City with Robin at his side, specualation has raged over the caped crusader's sexuality. After the original dark Batman stories came a softer, friendlier style in the late 1940s and early 1950s, which was deemed 'camp' by some observers. Various commentators have referred to the 'subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature Batman and his young friend Robin', and called the 1960s television series a 'touchstone of camp'. Opinions differ among writers who have penned Batman stories for DC Comics, with Alan Grant stating: 'The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay'. Devin Grayson agreed, but added: 'I certainly understand the gay readings.' But Batman writer Grant Morrison previously said in an interview that 'gayness is built into Batman'. Actor George Clooney, who donned the mask for an instalment of the film franchise in 1997, has said he had played the character as a gay man. Batman and Robin was directed by Joel Schumacher, who previously directed Batman Forever in 1995. Both movies attracted attention for the inclusion of homo-erotic innuendoes between Batman and his sidekick.","Erotic Lives of the Superheroes imagines Batman as an ageing homosexual .

At first glance, this psychedelic satellite image looks like an alien landscape - but scientists say it and others like it could actually hold the key to accurately measuring the effect of climate change. German researchers have developed a new technique using bright colours to show the spread of aquatic plants in lakes, and say it reveals a key indicator of the effect of climate change - and can be used to quickly analyse satellite images from around the globe. Currently, divers have to make visual inspections to spot ‘invading’ plants which flourish due to changing temperatures. With the help of aerial images - such as this one showing the western shore of Lake Starnberg - scientists are able to track the spread of certain aquatic plants. This information sheds light on the quality of the water (blue- bare sediment; green and yellow- sparse vegetation; dark red- dense vegetation) For instance, Elodea nuttallii and Najas marina, better known as western waterweed and spiny naiad, have been spreading rapidly in German water bodies in recent years. Ecologists are able to use them as indicator plants. Their proliferation allows researchers to draw conclusions on water quality – Elodea nuttallii and Najas marina are particularly common in lakes with rising water temperatures.

Now researchers at the Technische Universität München have written software that can spot the invading plants from space. ‘This new idea involves replacing some . of the diving effort with high-resolution aerial and satellite images,’ said project supervisor Dr. Thomas Schneider.

But after seven months on a strict calorie-controlled regime Mike has slimmed down to a svelte 38kg - just in time for the tail-end of summer. Adoptive owners Hannah Holland and Paolo Terzaga swapped Mike's three daily human meals for two tins of bespoke dog food, and raw carrots for treats. Ella Tonge, of Dogs Trust Loughborough, said: 'Mike was the largest dog we’ve had. 'He would eat pretty much anything. 'All the staff were so excited when we heard he was coming back into the centre. Fighting fit: Mike can now fit in the hydrophysio machine to strengthen his legs . Crippled: the three-year-old was so big he needed surgery to be able to walk again . 'We’d heard that he had lost loads of weight but to see it in the flesh is amazing, he has a waist.' Ella added: 'His plight highlighted the danger of over-feeding your pet and even worse feeding them a human diet. 'What is fine for us to eat is not for them, especially when combined with very little exercise.' In February, partners Miss Holland and Mr Terzaga, both 29, took Mike for surgery to fix his leg. He now spends two hours a day walking, running and chasing after balls at his new home in Nottingham. Before and after: now weighing 38kg, Mike loves running, jumping and chasing balls . The trimmer pup can finally fit into the hydrotherapy tank at the Dogs Trust Loughborough for treat his worn limbs. Miss Holland, a veterinary student, . said: 'Mike has always been such a bright and happy boy, even when he . was nearly twice the size he should be. 'He just wanted to say hello to everyone and bounced around like a puppy. 'He’s . still recovering from his ligament operation and has just started . hydrotherapy at the Dogs Trust, something he seems to really enjoy. A new leash on life: Hannah Holland and Paolo Terzaga have put the energetic labrador on a strict calorie-controlled regime . 'When he first arrived at Dogs Trust in early 2013 he was so large he couldn’t fit into the hydrotherapy tank . 'But now with his new figure he is able to take full advantage of the tank and help rebuild his strength and ensure he is distributing his weight evenly.” Mr Terzaga, a chartered accountant, added: 'He’s always had a great personality and hasn’t really changed much. 'He just seems happier that he can get around easier.'","The three-year-old was living on the same hefty chicken dinners as his owner .

Other friends in the group could only watch in horror as Mr Marshall, of Saltcoats, and Mr Munn, of Ardorossan, failed to surface from the icy water, and ran to a nearby farmhouse to raise the alarm. A search and rescue operation was launched at around 8pm on Monday night and a police underwater unit, helicopter and 10 firefighters were sent to the scene.

Floral tributes have been left at the scene of the tragedy and grieving friends have paid tribute to the pair. A neighbour of Mr Marshall said: 'Sean Paul was so full of life and would help anyone. 'I heard there was a group of five or six of them up at the dam. Supposedly they had spent the day up there fishing. Heartbreak: Friends of the pair have been left devastated by the death of the two young men . 'One of the boys went in swimming and got into bother so Sean Paul jumped in to try and help him. 'The group of friends got help but it must have been too late. The dam is a popular spot for the kids to hang about but this just proves how dangerous it is up there.' Close friend Stephanie Dave left a touching tribute at the scene. She wrote: 'Still can't believe that both of you are gone, I'm so heartbroken both of you were too young. 'I'll miss you so much if only I could get one more hug and hear your voicesone last time. 'Love you both so much RIP.' A friend said: 'Sean Paul and Ross were always really close pals. 'You never saw one without the other and they always hung about up at the dam. 'I think Ross had just finished school and Sean Paul was talking about going back to college.

'I didn't know Ross that well but he was really funny. Sean Paul had two brothers and they will be devastated.' There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the incident and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal. Superintendent Neil Kerr warned people of the dangers of playing or swimming in open water during warm weather. 'It may look calm on the surface, but there may be strong undercurrents,' he said. 'The water can also be very cold and deep, and there are often sudden drops and underwater obstacles and undergrowth that you cannot see, causing even the strongest of swimmers to get into difficulty very easily.' Carlene McAvoy, Scotland's community safety development officer for the Royal Society of the Prevention of Accidents, said: 'RoSPA's advice is to go swimming at properly-supervised sites, such as beaches, lidos or swimming pools, although we appreciate that not everyone can get to these locations.'

Giving to the poor: Robin Hood actor Jonas Armstrong was today told he must do 80 hours work in a charity shop after admitting drink driving . Robin Hood actor Jonas Armstrong was today ordered to give to the poor and work in a charity shop after he was caught at the wheel of his car while three-and-a-half times the drink drive limit. The 31-year-old was told by a court he must do 80 hours unpaid work as punishment for getting into his £30,000 Audi A6 while drunk. A car park attendant watched him on CCTV struggle to use his credit card to pay for his ticket as he staggered around in a multi-storey in Liverpool city centre. The vehicle was then moved away from the bay while Armstrong had his ticket taken away for 'inspection' by the attendant. The actor, who played Robin in three series' of the BBC One drama, today admitted drink driving when he appeared before magistrates in Blackpool. Armstrong, who also stars in Prisoner's Wives, initially refused to provide police with a breath specimen at the scene. He told them he had merely been sitting in the car with the engine on because it is 'f****** freezing'. However, he was arrested and breathalysed at the police station. He had 127 micograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath and the legal limit is 35. Peter Bardsley, prosecuting, said that Armstrong went into the 600 space car park after drinking heavily in the city. The prosecutor said: 'It was 7.15pm on a Sunday and the car park attendant watched him on CCTV. 'He was struggling to use a credit card to pay for a car park ticket at an automated machine and was staggering around. 'After a few minutes he got a ticket and went back to his car. The attendant went to the car to check the ticket after informing the police about the situation. Armstrong was sat in the driver’s seat and the engine was running. 'The attendant took Armstrong’s ticket away for checking and when he returned found that the car had been moved from the bay it had been parked in. 'The police arrived and formed the opinion that Armstrong was very drunk. He was asked to provide a breath test and became hostile.'

We know all about her Friday night suppers. She’s even told us about her father’s Christmas costumes (one year, a sumo outfit). As if that wasn’t enough information, now socialite-turned-columnist Pippa Middleton has regaled us with tales of her schoolgirl crush on her hockey coach – and how her ‘derriere’ helped her out on the netball pitch. Alas, the ‘undeniably fanciable’ object of her affections may be less than delighted to find himself the subject of her latest column, ‘Confessions of a sporty schoolgirl’ – he has just started a new job as the head of a prestigious school. Crush: Pippa Middleton, pictured in London earlier this week, has described her old PE teacher as 'undeniably fanciable' Miss Middleton, 29, wrote the article for this week’s Spectator. She . describes how she was the proud captain of the hockey team at . Marlborough College in Wiltshire, which her sister Kate, now the Duchess . of Cambridge, also attended. She writes: ‘When I close my eyes and think about school sports, I . envisage myself on the hockey pitch, stick in hand, a luminous gumshield . locked on to my chops and a bandana across my forehead. (Bandanas were . all the rage back then). Pippa's old PE teacher Mr Markham . ‘Boys are watching. I can also hear the booming voice of Mr Markham, our fierce but undeniably fanciable coach, urging us all on.’ She adds later: ‘Did I mention the boys watching?’ Last night the Daily Mail tracked down the object of her teenage crush, Richard Markham, 41, himself a one-time Welsh international hockey star. He has just started a new job as head of a top private school in Hertfordshire, where his efforts to establish himself with his pupils are unlikely to be aided by Miss Middleton’s happy memories. Twelve years older than Miss Middleton, he would have been in his early twenties and newly on the staff of Marlborough when she became a pupil. Mr Markham, from Southampton, read history at Oxford University and represented Wales at hockey at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. He married his university sweetheart Kate Farquahar, the same year. A physics graduate, she now works as a high-flying executive at a City insurance firm. Last night Mr Markham was reluctant to discuss his former pupil. But his 71-year-old father, David, laughed when he heard about Miss Middleton’s description. He said: ‘I think he will be abashed by the description. He is quite reserved. But Kate [his wife] will think it is quite funny.’ He added: ‘I would not say he was “fierce” but he does have what I would call a traditional school teacher look – he can look at you in a way that gets your attention.’ He said Mr Markham’s mother, Jennifer, who died a few years ago, would have agreed with the description. ‘She was a schoolteacher and she had that same look as well,’ he said. Alumni: Pippa was captain of the hockey team at the prestigious Marlborough College in Wiltshire, pictured . New role: Mr Markham is now principal at the Hockerill Anglo-European College in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire . Mr Markham taught at Marlborough until earlier this year, rising to the post of director of studies. He taught both history and history of art, and was the school’s master in charge of hockey. He is now principal of Hockerill Anglo-European College in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, which charges up to £14,379 a year for boarders. He lives with his wife and their two children in a large detached house that comes with the job. Last night he said: ‘I taught at Marlborough for 20 years and we categorically never comment on pupils or former pupils.’ But despite her fondness for Mr Markham, he was not the man Pippa was most worried about. She recalls: ‘The other Mr M in my life (father and also coach) is on the sidelines, and I’m desperate to impress him most of all.’ Elsewhere in the column she reveals she also played netball, which she describes as ‘like basketball with all the fun bits taken out’. But she said the shoulder-barging, though brutal, ‘turns out to have been very useful practice for handling the media in later life’. Cheered on: Pippa, pictured (right) at Wimbledon with her parents, says that the man she most wanted to impress with her hockey skills however, was the 'other Mr M in her life' - her father Michael (centre) She wrote: ‘You spend most of the time playing a complex version of piggy-in-the-middle, except the piggies are a pack of vicious girls. My petite physique enabled me to nip and tuck my way past the bigger-chested girls. ‘Elbows always helped; as did the derriere for defence (my “chest” hadn’t developed back then) and  a bit of shoulder-barging here  or there.’ She said her ‘piano legs’ helped her do well at cross country, adding: ‘We Middleton girls were always  at the starting line – albeit reluctantly – fuelled by Lucozade tablets and bananas. ‘Rain was inevitable and we’d get caked in mud from head to toe, in our tiny athletic shorts, white Aertex and all.’ She said the worst horror of all was the swimming gala, and in particular the changing rooms where ‘everyone had to walk around sheepishly in tight Speedo bathing suits’. Miss Middleton was asked to write the article for the Spectator’s supplement on independent schools, on sale from today. She also writes a food column in Waitrose Kitchen magazine and is a contributing editor to Vanity Fair magazine. In a previous Spectator column, she told readers that her father, Michael, liked wearing fancy dress at Christmas.

A couple from California, who wrote a popular blog about their journey to adopt four children from Ghana, was detained by Ghanaian authorities on suspicion of child trafficking as they tried to take the youngsters back to the U.S. Sol and Christine Moghadam, from Irvine, were traveling with their two biological children and four . adopted siblings when they were stopped at Accra's . airport on Friday. The couple's two biological sons were taken from them and placed in a Ghanaian orphanage, while Mr and Mrs Moghadam were forced to spend a night in detention. They were released the following day and reunited with their sons, aged three and seven, and the chief police officer admitted officials had overreacted, Mrs Moghadam said. Scroll down for video . Detained: Sol and Christine Moghadam were jailed for child trafficking when they tried to leave Ghana with four children they were trying to adopt. Their two sons, pictured, were put in an orphanage . But they have still not been allowed to leave the country or see their four adopted children, two boys, aged 10 and 13, and two younger girls. 'We are investigating a couple who arrived at the airport with six children – four blacks and two whites which aroused the suspicion of security officers at the airport who stopped them from traveling,' Comfort Miah, from the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of the Ghanaian police, told AP. 'They say the children were adopted and we are investigating to find out if this has been properly granted by a court of proper jurisdiction.' In a video created on their behalf, the couple's friends said Mrs Moghadam was forced to spend a night in jail on Friday, while Mr Moghadam was held in a detention center. Excitement: The couple, who have been together 13 years, were matched with the four siblings - two boys and two girls - in Ghana last November . Family: The couple's two biological sons were reunited with their parents after a day and officers apologised . Friends flocked to the couple's Facebook page and blog to voice their support. Ghana requires that a couple must be married to adopt. Single women can adopt, but only if they are a citizen of Ghana. Males cannot, unless the man is the biological father. The country also requires that a couple reside in Ghana three months before the adoption, although the courts can waive this. Only orphans can be adopted from Ghana and brought to the US. A couple must be found eligible to adopt by the Department of Homeland Security, which requires interviews and visits at the home. They need a Ghanaian Social Welfare Officer in the area they wish to adopt from. They are then matched with a child on the suggestion of the adoption agency in Ghana and may have a trial living period. The couple must provide documents - such as birth and marriage records - and the High Court then must approve the application. It takes a year to complete an adoption in Ghana. An additional one to six months may be needed for the U.S. immigration visa process. Before a child can travel to the US, they will need: a new birth certificate (with the new parents' names), a Ghanaian passport and an US immigrant visa. Source: State Department .

They made immediate contact with their adoption agency, which has reportedly sent out three representatives to help the family. The Moghadams, who have been together for 13 years, have been documenting their plans to adopt the four siblings from Ghana on a blog. The couple discussed adoption in the early years of their marriage, as Mr Moghadam had survived the life of a street child in Tehran before emigrating to the U.S. and wanted to help others. They first filled out adoption . application forms in 2010 and initially petitioned to adopt a child in Ethiopia. But in November 2011, they were matched with the children in Ghana after they saw their adoption agency's waiting list. According to their blog, they received final approval in April. On Tuesday, they posted: 'We . are emotionally exhausted and traumatized from the entire incident, but . we are thankful to have support and prayers from friends and family . worldwide. 'Our case is not complete yet but our . chief officer from the Ghana police department has apologized for their . overreaction and stated that our detainment was a mistake on their . part.' They added there are 'many pending circumstances before uniting our family'. Ghanaian said the couple did provide documents, but that it needed to be checked.

'The couple had documentation, but we . have had cases where such documentation is fraudulent, so we are having . it verified,' said Frank Kwofie, from the police's criminal . investigations department. On Sunday, Sol posted on his wife's Facebook page and lambasted the U.S. embassy. 'Granted, that US embassy can not . intervene in the Ghanaian legal procedures,' he wrote.

Wanted: Police released this mugshot of Anthony Morrison when he was wanted for questioning about an armed robbery . A criminal who was hauled to court to face robbery charges after a two-month manhunt has walked free after a judge ruled the 'wanted' picture of him issued by police had contaminated evidence. Detectives had released a mugshot of career criminal Anthony Morrison, 32, when he was wanting for questioning over a £20,000 robbery at an Adsa supermarket. But witnesses due to testify against him at his trial told police they recognised his face after seeing the wanted picture - despite all the robbers wearing balaclavas during the raid. On the first day of the planned trial, prosecutors said there was 'huge potential for contamination' in the evidence against him. Apart from the eyewitnesses, whose identification of Morrison was 'contaminated', the only other evidence was that his DNA was found on a distinctive jacket linked to the robbery. But prosecutors said there was no evidence that Morrison was wearing the jacket at the time of the attack, and he could have worn it previously. Simon Parry, prosecuting told Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court that he would offer no evidence against Morrison, adding: 'Suspicion isn't enough.' Morrison, who had previously been jailed for six years for conspiracy to rob, was suspected of being one of four men armed with a sledgehammer and handgun who had attacked security guards filling ATM machines at Asda in Oldham, Greater Manchester. One of the guards was punched twice in the face during the raid in 2011, while another heard one of the robbers shout 'Just shoot him'. The thieves made off with a cash box containing £20,000. Suspects Jason Butterworth, 33, and Michael Ford, 34, were arrested but Morrison fled to Spain in December 2011. The following July he called police from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam to say he wanted to give himself up. Arrangements were made for him to board an aircraft to Manchester because officers were legally unable to go to Holland to escort him back to Britain. Morrison agreed to be arrested by officers when he arrived at Manchester Airport but when he touched down at Terminal One from his EasyJet flight he fled before he got to passport control. Suspected: Morrison (left) was found not guilty because the evidence against him was 'contaminated'. His friend Jason Butterworth (right) was jailed for nine and a half years after admitting robbery . While officers were waiting in Terminal One, . he forced his way through a locked door into Terminal Three and . disappeared into the crowd before escaping in a taxi. It was then that police issued his mugshot in a wanted appeal. They failed to track him down until . nearly two months later, when he arrived at North Manchester General . Hospital with a bullet wound to his chest. Morrison staggered from the passenger . seat of a BMW, which drove away as he was helped by paramedics outside . the hospital on August 26 last year. It is not known who shot him, why or where. Speaking at court, prosecutor Mr Parry . said: 'Firstly, the main priority for everybody concerned is that they . had to save his life. It wasn’t until later in the year that he was . arrested. 'On November 12 last year he was . arrested, answering “no comment” to questions. The only evidence in the . robbery case centred around a very distinctive jacket that had his DNA . on the collar. 'Initially the offenders were . described as having their faces covered by balaclavas and the victims . said they couldn’t identify the men due to this. 'But about a month before Morrison was . arrested, the victims said they had seen articles in the press and . recognised him, despite the fact he wore a face covering. 'There is huge potential for . contamination. Many articles said he was the man responsible for the . robbery and then the victims gave a statement saying they recognised his . face only after his picture had been released. Attack: Four men armed with a sledgehammer and handgun carried out a £20,000 raid at ATMs at Asda, in Oldham . 'Aside from this identification, the . only evidence is his DNA on the collar of the jacket. There is no doubt . the offender wore that jacket. However our expert confirms that it is . not possible to tell when that was.' Mr Parry said Morrison was an . acquaintance of those convicted of the robbery and said he went to the . gym with Butterworth, so it was not possible to confirm when he had worn . the jacket. That meant the only evidence was witnesses' identification of Morrison, which was 'contaminated.’ Mr Parry added: 'The prosecution . aren’t confident relying on the evidence. There is an overwhelming . likelihood that the identification is contaminated. 'His DNA is bound to be on the getaway . car as he goes to the gym with the other offender. He said he has been . in the car plenty of times and he has worn that jacket and it is likely . that he has. 'But can we say he was the last person . to wear it? No, we can’t.

The scheme involved some mortgages against properties that did not exist, as well as the use of false property valuations and fraudulent paperwork claiming to show rent incomes and deposits. Antony Lowry-Huws, 65, from Kinmel Bay, north Wales - the 'ringleader' - was jailed for seven years for leading the £50million fraud that involved more than 1,000 bogus mortgage applications.

Some brands of butter and supposedly ‘healthy’ spreads contain almost as much salt as seawater, a study shows. Because of its high saturated fat content, butter is associated with health risks such as weight gain, clogged arteries and heart disease. However, research by Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash), suggests the salt content of some spreads is also a concern. Weight Watchers Dairy Spread contains 2.5g of salt per 100g which makes it as salty as seawater . Seven in ten salted butters would . receive a red traffic light label for salt under guidelines drawn up by . the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Researchers found that fewer than four in ten spreads meet the Department of Health’s 2012 salt reduction targets. The . study warned that labels can be confusing. It pointed to Marks & . Spencer Softer Butter, which is described as ‘slightly salted’, but . contains more than the chain’s Salted Farmhouse Butter. The study found that ‘low fat’ spreads can be higher in salt than the full fat versions, while one was as salty as some oceans. Some of the saltiest butters available are Country Life Butter (2g salt per 100g), Essential Waitrose Salted Dairy Butter (1.9g salt per 100g) and Anchor Butter (1.7g salt per 100g) The . saltiest butter was found to be Country Life at 2g of salt per 100g, . ahead of Essential Waitrose Salted Dairy Butter at 1.9g. Among . margarines and spreads, the highest level was in Weight Watchers Dairy . Spread at 2.5g salt per 100g – seawater is typically between 2.5 and 3.5 . per cent salt. Katharine . Jenner, campaign manager at Cash, warned: ‘Just one slice of buttered . toast can contain more salt than a packet of crisps.’ Consumers . generally eat spreads in relatively small amounts but their salt intake . is boosted by eating processed foods such as bread and breakfast . cereals. High salt . intake poses few health problems in the short term. But continued high . consumption is linked to raised blood pressure and the greater risk of a . stroke and early death. Britons . routinely consume more than the recommended maximum of 6g of salt a day . for adults, resulting in an extra 70,000 heart attacks and strokes each . year. Graham MacGregor, . chairman of Cash and Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the . Wolfson Institute, said: ‘It is a national scandal that there is still . so much unnecessary salt in our food. ‘For . every one gramme reduction in salt intake, we can prevent 12,000 heart . attacks, strokes and heart failures, half of which would have been . fatal. ‘It is vital that the Department of Health ensures that manufacturers reduce the salt in these products immediately.’ Victoria . Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation, said: . ‘Shoppers clearly have to look twice when making the switch from butter . to unsaturated spread. ‘Manufacturers . and supermarkets must cut back on the salt in their products so there . is one less thing for shoppers to worry about.’ ‘With so many varieties on offer, picking a healthy spread is confusing enough for consumers. ‘Manufactures . and supermarkets must cut back on the salt in their products so there . is one less thing for shoppers to worry about.’ CASH has offered suggestions about how people can reduce their salt intake. It . suggests that people opt for unsalted spreads and butters, that they . think twice about diet spreads with less fat as they may contain more . salt, that people reduce their butter and spread portions, and that . people use olive oil when cooking instead of butter.

Eight months after meeting and falling in love with an Austrian doctor, Cambridge graduate Beth Schlesinger abandoned her career and moved to Vienna to marry him. When the marriage began to go wrong, she agreed to try to patch things up by starting a family and they had twin sons. But rows over the children drove them further apart – and now she has lost custody of the four-year-old boys after an Austrian court ruled that her husband is a better parent. Last night Mrs Schlesinger, 29, said she feels marooned in a foreign country and added: ‘I don’t know how a court can believe it is better for such young children to be with their father instead of their mother. ‘It is breaking my heart being allowed to see them for just a few hours a week.’ Mrs Schlesinger, a solicitor’s daughter from Manchester, gave up her place on a master’s course at a New York university after she fell in love with society doctor Michael Schlesinger. Aged 22, she moved to Vienna to marry him despite protests from her parents and being unable to speak any German. But, she said, the relationship began to wane after only a week. She claims he became so controlling he would not even let her go to the toilet at night. After they separated and started a custody battle over the children, Dr Schlesinger, 33, unsuccessfully attempted to have his wife sectioned. His claims that she had mental illness were dismissed in court, but an Austrian judge still took the rare step of giving him sole custody of the twins. Mrs Schlesinger has visitation rights but can see her sons Samuel and Benjamin for only 20 hours a fortnight. She has accused the court  of unfairly favouring her  ‘well-connected’ husband and has begun an appeal with  the Austrian high court. And Graham Stringer, Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton in Manchester, has raised concerns with the Austrian ambassador about the way the case was handled. The twins: A photograph taken of Samuel and Benjamin by Beth before she left her estranged husband in 2010 . Mrs Schlesinger said: ‘I gave up my own life and now I feel stranded and alone in a strange country. With the language barrier and my husband’s superior contacts it feels like I stand no chance. 'But I can’t give up. I have to keep going, if not for me then for my boys. They need their mother.’ Mrs Schlesinger, who read Oriental Studies at Girton College, met her future husband on a trip to Paris in 2006. She said: ‘It all seemed very romantic and a big adventure, but the marriage was terrible from the beginning. ‘Looking back I realise that I never really knew Michael. I was so naive and I fell for him as he was very charming and seemed like a caring, trustworthy person. I was so wrong.’ A mother's love: Beth pictured with Samuel and Benjamin when the twins were still in her care a few years ago . She claimed that they argued constantly about what their sons ate, how they dressed, when they slept and how long they could spend in the bath. In February 2010, after a row over how much milk the boys could have, Mrs Schlesinger called police and spent the night at a women’s refuge, saying she feared for her safety. After her husband began legal action to win custody of the children a psychologist who prepared a report for the court declared Mrs Schlesinger had ‘reduced child raising capabilities’ and was paranoid. Two further psychological reports presented at later hearings found she did not have mental health issues. But Dr Schlesinger was awarded full custody of the twins. Mrs Schlesinger claims her estranged husband has been favoured by the Austrian legal system because of his well-respected profession. The case has been reported to Austria’s judicial ombudsman and she has started an appeal claiming the judge was not impartial and that the procedures did not follow due process. Last night Dr Schlesinger was unavailable for comment.","Beth Schlesinger, 29, can only see her sons for 20 hours a fortnight .

Opportunities: Treasury minister Sajid Javid said leaving the EU was not something voters needed to fear . Leaving the European Union is not something to be afraid of, Treasury minister Sajid Javid has claimed. The Tory MP suggested that if voters choose to sever ties with the EU, Britain could ‘seize opportunities that would create’. His surprise intervention came as David Cameron revealed curbing migrants’ access to benefits will be a key demand in his forthcoming battle to claw powers back from Brussels. The Prime Minister has promised to stage an in-out referendum by 2017, after negotiating a ‘fresh settlement’ with the EU including returning some powers to London. He revealed he is looking closely at the problem of ‘welfare tourism’ including workers in this country claiming child benefit when their families live abroad as part of the rules he wants overhauled. In an interview at the G20 summit yesterday, Mr Cameron gave his first indication of the flashpoints in his promised renegotiation of the UK’s relationship with Brussels. The Prime Minister has repeatedly said he wants Britain to remain part of a reformed EU. But Mr Javid, tipped for promotion in the next government reshuffle, said leaving the EU altogether was not something to fear. He insisted the best outcome of the . process to change the UK's relationship with Brussels would be remaining . in a reformed EU more focused on free trade. But he told The House magazine: ‘We can all be better off inside the European Union if it can change some of its ways. ‘But as I say, if the British people . decide the decision is they want to leave the European Union, then that . isn't something that I'd be afraid of, I'd embrace the opportunities . that would create.’ At the beginning of the year, Mr . Cameron pledged to repatriate powers from the European Union ahead of an . in-out referendum on membership by the end of 2017, if the . Conservatives win the next election. Migrants: Prime Minister David Cameron said he wants the EU to look at the rules on benefits . A backbench bill is being piloted through Parliament by Tory MP James Wharton to legislate for the vote, but stands little chance of becoming law against Labour and Lib Dem opposition. Mr Cameron told The Times he was looking at restricting the ability of migrants from other EU member states to work in Britain, and the options for limiting their access to working-age benefits. Uncontrolled immigration from EU countries is worrying ministers ahead of the lifting of transitional controls on people from Bulgaria and Romania coming to Britain at the end of this year. The Prime Minister said: ‘Could the whole problems of immigration, problems with welfare tourism . . . be part of ... making sure we have a European relationship that works for Britain? Yes of course it can. We should consider all of these things. ‘I think we particularly need to look at the rules on benefits. One of the advantages of British membership of the EU is that British people go and live and work in other countries. But I think there is a problem with people living [here] and not working. I also think that transitional controls have been absolutely vital and we need to look at what more we can do on that front.’ He was asked which issues of Britain’s EU membership he has discussed with allies in Europe, including German chancellor Angela Merkel, who has backed calls for member states to take back powers from the European Commission, and the Netherlands which is also concerned about the free movement of people in the 28-member union. But the Prime Minister acknowledged there was nothing that the Government could do in the short-term stop Romanian and Bulgarian jobseekers arriving in Britain from January. Estimates for how many will come to Britain are up to 400,000. Last year, net migration from EU nations to the UK was 82,000. The number of EU citizens claiming jobseeker’s allowance or benefits such as those for single parents, the bereaved, carers and disabled people in February this year was 121,200. Talks: Mr Cameron is hoping to win the support of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured at the G20 summit in Russia, to reform EU benefits rules . While proposals for EU talks have yet to be tabled they could include tightening rules of residence for benefit claimants and stopping child benefit payments to migrants for offspring living abroad. Mats Persson, of the Open Europe think-tank, said: ‘This is an issue that ranks highly among the UK public’s concerns about the EU and meshes with what Cameron actually can achieve in Europe. ‘The Germans are sympathetic to giving countries more control over who can access benefits, in order to maintain confidence in EU free movement. Given this shared interest, Cameron is right to target this early in EU talks over a new settlement.’ Earlier this year senior government sources revealed they expected Brussels to sue the British government for ‘discriminating’ against other EU nationals over welfare payments. Since 2004 Britain has required EU nationals to be formally resident in the UK in order to claim state handouts, such as child tax credits, which the Commission said was a breach of EU rules as the ‘right to reside’ could be discriminatory. Ministers have in recent months floated plans to charge EU migrants for using the NHS and restrict their access to legal aid. They are also considering plans to restrict benefit payments to new arrivals from Romania and Bulgaria from January if they do not find work.","Tory Javid says Britain hails the 'opportunities' of Britain leaving the EU .

PC Kevin Peel kicked a boy in the throat in this supermarket car park in South London, a court heard (file pic) The boy, who cannot be named for . legal reasons, told the court he struggled to . breathe after the Metropolitan Police Service officer kicked him twice in the throat, and called him a 'thieving c***'. The trial heard he and a number of friends were being pursued by officers in marked cars in the early hours of the morning on 17 July last year. The teenager said he had attempted to flee as he was carrying bolt-croppers, but said that after cycling away from the rest of the group, he was followed by Peel’s car which had its windows down. 'He was telling me to stop or he was going to let the dog out,' he said. The . teenager said he continued to cycle around the car park but after . dumping the bag near some trolleys he stopped and rested against a wall . of the supermarket near to the police car. He said the dog then jumped out of the window of the vehicle and bit him, causing him to come off his bike. Peel now faces losing his job after being convicted of assault at Westminster Magistrates Court today . The . victim, who is now 16, said he was left lying on his back on the ground . while the seven-stone German Shepherd named Oscar continued to bite him before Peel got out of the car . and approached him. Giving evidence behind a screen, the boy told the court: 'He started kicking me on my waist. This is while the dog was biting me. 'Then he kicked me in my throat the second time.  I couldn’t breathe properly. I was coughing', he said. Peel, from Crawley, West Sussex, denied kicking and swearing at the boy and said he was trying to get the police dog off the boy. Asked if he had kicked the boy Peel, a serving police officer since 1990, said: 'Of course I didn't.' 'I was actually fighting with the police dog to get away.' Finding Peel guilty of assault, District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe said: ‘I have to say that I cannot see how a kick could possibly be considered reasonable force in the position where there is a 15 year-old boy already on the ground and there are three police officers and one police dog. ‘But I have to say in all the circumstance of this case, having heard the evidence, I have absolutely no doubt that you kicked him and I find you guilty of assault.’ She acquitted Peel of a public order offence, in relation to his use of the word ‘c***’, but fined him £500 plus £500 costs and a £50 victim surcharge. The district judge said the boy would not receive any compensation as he did not receive any lasting injuries. Peel’s lawyer, Matthew Butt, said the verdict meant the policeman would lose his job 'without any doubt'. Earlier, PC Vincent Turner, a witness to the episode, told the court how he encouraged the victim to take deep breaths to help him get his breath back after he had been kicked. Shaven-headed Peel, dressed in dark suit and blue tie, wept as the verdict was announced.  He was supported by several fellow officers in the public gallery. The boy later received a police caution for going equipped for theft, the court heard.","PC Kevin Peel, 44, assaulted the boy in supermarket car park in Sainsbury's car park in Vauxhall, south London .

Row: Celebrated chef Rick Stein is at the centre of a row after two Scottish restaurants claimed they produced the best fish and chips he had ever tasted . When top TV chef Rick Stein told Lilian MacDonald her fish and chips were the best he’d ever tasted, she couldn’t wait to tell the world. She put up signs at the Oban Fish and Chip Shop, as well as an advertising board on the pavement outside her business in the bustling Argyll port, quoting the comment by her No1 fan. But now a war of words has broken out after the neighbouring Nories establishment, on a shiny new advertising board, attributed similar words of praise about their fish and chips to a surname-less ‘Rick’. Nories, just along from Mrs MacDonald’s shop in George Street, is run by the Di Ciacca family, who have served fish and chips to the people of Oban for three generations. The board outside Nories quotes ‘Rick’ saying: ‘Best fish and chips I’ve ever had’ – while the one at the Oban Fish and Chip Shop quotes Rick Stein saying: ‘The best fish and chips I’ve ever tasted.’ Mrs MacDonald, who has been running the Oban Fish and Chip Shop for eight years, said the sign went up outside her shop to try and encourage business. She said: ‘Rick Stein said our fish and chips were the best he had ever tasted. We were in his programme Food Heroes and he was seen coming out of our shop with fish and chips. Bruised and battered: Lilian MacDonald said she couldn't wait just couldn't wait to tell the world how much Rick loved her food . The sign: This is the one that is linked to the Oban Fish and Chip Shop but a rival has apparently tried to claim the same . ‘We thought we would promote it, so we put signs up a couple of years ago and people are always commenting on it. ‘The reason I put the signs up was because I didn’t want people getting confused with the other place, it was just a bit of marketing. ‘But then one of my staff came in with a photo of their new sign. I think it is misleading the public, saying “Rick”. It might not say Rick Stein, but it says Rick and it is blatantly obvious they are trying to confuse people. ‘I feel that they are trying to undermine me in my business. There is plenty in the town for everyone, but they want the biggest piece of the pie. ‘How would they like it if I put a sign outside saying: “Three generations of fish-frying excellence?”’ Renato Di Ciacca said Nories did not wish to comment. War: Neighbouring shop Nories in Oban attributed similar words of praise about their fish and chips . Notice: Their sign attributes the message to a mysterious 'Rick', but critics say this clearly links to Mr Stein . It is the second time that TV chef Stein has been at the centre of a local culinary storm. In 2000, he left a bad taste in the mouths of staff at a sea life museum as he filmed for the new television series. Staff at the Scottish SEA LIFE Sanctuary in Oban claimed Stein borrowed five of their lovingly nurtured colony of rare horse mussels, known as ‘clabby doos’, but only returned four of them. And they believe the TV chef ate one raw after a fisherman showed him the best way to eat it. Programme: Rick Stein's India is currently being shown on the BBC, another of the chef's culinary adventures which previously included a trip to Oban on his 'Food Heroes' show . Museum curator Mark Steward said: ‘We’d had our horse mussels for seven years and we hadn’t nurtured them for so long just to provide a tasty treat for Rick Stein.’ But Stein’s production staff laughed off the claims. Programme producer David Pritchard said: ‘I can assure you that if Rick had eaten a raw mussel after it had been in a tank for seven years then he might not be with us now. ‘I don’t think they would have been very edible. He did open one up so that we could see what it looked like inside, but I have to say it wasn’t very appetising and he certainly didn’t eat it. ‘Rick may have thought about eating one on camera – but he would not have dreamed of  actually doing so.’ Nevertheless, Stein has helped to make the traditional fish and chip supper a staple across the country. Experts have credited him with helping to boost tourism both locally and nationally. His second fish and chip shop opened in Cornwall almost three years ago. The Falmouth town centre shop has a sister outlet in Padstow. Richard Voase, a specialist in the sociology of tourism, said the shops would generate wealth for the region through increasing visitors. Mr Voase, from the University of Lincoln, said: ‘Restaurants are normally secondary attractions – you think about where you are going to eat once you have arrived. ‘But a celebrity chef turns a restaurant into a primary tourist attraction because it becomes part of the reason to visit. ‘Tourist attractions like these generate wealth for the region by increasing the volume of incoming visitors and, more controversially, for second-home ownership.’ Figures show around £1 out of every £100 consumers spend on food is handed over to the local chip shop. According to recent surveys, the Welsh are most likely to prefer to fry their chips in the traditional fashion, rather than opt for the oven-cooked varieties. During World War II, fish and chips – once described by Churchill as ‘the good companions’ – escaped rationing. Rick Stein’s new programme, Rick Stein’s India: The Search For The Perfect Curry, started on BBC2 this week.","Row in Scottish port of Oban over which fish and chips Rick Stein liked best .

Token of gratitude: Nurses at a Sheffield hospital have been told they must record all gifts and thank you cards they receive . They were once simply a nice gesture for patients to show how much they appreciated a caring nurse. But now hospital staff have been told they will have to keep a monthly record of all the gifts and thank you cards they are given at work. Nicknamed the ‘chocolate audit’, nurses at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield have been ordered to keep a monthly tally chart of all the cards, chocolates and biscuits they receive. The forms are split into two columns – ‘cards’ and ‘chocolates/biscuits’. A statement at the bottom reads: ‘When you are given a card or chocolates put a tally  on the chart. This is for governance data.’ The charts were brought in this month and staff will have to fill them out until August next year when they will be collected by bosses. One staff member, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ‘This just leaves a sour taste in the mouth because something which was essentially a nice gesture has been turned into something bureaucratic and it is being used to monitor performance.’ The forms have also been criticised by campaigners who want to reduce bureaucracy in the NHS. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘You’d hope medical staff have more important things to do than snoop on the gifts and thank you cards coming into a hospital. ‘It’s a frankly bizarre idea that intrudes on the privacy of staff and patients, wastes valuable hospital time and takes micromanagement to a whole new level.’ He added: ‘It’s right that managers have the right data to run a hospital. ‘But when that starts to look like monitoring absolutely everything their staff are doing it stops being about management and becomes a misguided and intrusive assault on people’s privacy.’ However hospital bosses said they would not use the tally charts to monitor staff performance. Chris Morley, deputy chief nurse at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, said: ‘A small number of wards have chosen to record the many gestures of thanks which patients make in addition to the formal monitoring of suggestions and complaints. Anger: One nurse who did not want to be named said that the move has left 'a sour taste in the mouth' (file picture) ‘This is not something which has been imposed across the Trust and does not form part of a formal governance collection process. ‘Having this record displayed enables all staff to be aware of the gestures of thanks patients have made. ‘Therefore the sentence “This is for governance data” is slightly inaccurate and on reflection should have been worded differently.’ In 2006 a similar scheme at the debt-ridden Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS trust was heavily criticised by health watchdogs and branded ‘management madness’. The trust, which was £8million in debt and about to axe 300 jobs, ordered nurses to count how many gifts they received from patients. Managers at the trust told staff to fill out forms stating what presents they get, who gave them and how much they are worth. At the time one nurse said: ‘It’s a complete and utter waste of time – there are 101 things we could be doing. ‘We are all worried about who is going to lose their jobs but at the same time we are doing fiddly  little jobs like counting bags of chocolate buttons.’","Staff at Sheffield's Northern General Hospital told to record all gifts and cards .

An insect enthusiast has been warned by police after releasing 1,000 crickets into his garden because he likes the noise they make. Daniel Emlyn-Jones bought the crickets for £40 from an online shop that sells live food for reptiles, then set them free in his garden to recreate the sounds of their Mediterranean home. Although his neighbours enjoyed the sound of the crickets, police still issued Mr Emlyn-Jones with a warning because the foreign insects could harm the local wildlife. Daniel Emlyn-Jones poses in his garden last month with one of his crickets . Daniel Emlyn-Jones released the insects because he liked the sound of the African field cricket (pictured), but was later warned by police . Police decided that Mr Emlyn-Jones, a church warden and private tutor in maths and science, had contravened the Wildlife and Countryside act, so handed out an Adult Restorative Disposal. PC Dean Kingham, a Thames Valley Police wildlife officer, said: 'The man released the insects as he liked the sound they made. 'While this sounds innocent, the introduction of animals not normally resident in the population can cause, at best, disruption to the local wildlife. 'At worst, it can cause damage by spreading disease or creating artificial populations.' Mr Emlyn-Jones declined to comment on his police warning, but police confirmed he had since used traps bought from a pest control company to get rid of the insects. Daniel Emlyn-Jones filled his garden with jet-black crickets (file photo) In an interview with the Independent last month, however, Mr Emlyn-Jones said that he didn't 'didn't know what to expect' when he released the creatures, and that he had taken to feeding them muesli. 'The idea of keeping crickets for their songs is rooted in ancient Chinese and Japanese culture', he told the paper, 'But I didn’t want to cage them, but let them be free.' While his neighbours can still hear the crickets, they say it is not an issue for them. Patrick Gray, 65, a neighbour and former city councillor, enjoyed the noise. He said: 'It was very loud and very cheerful and sounded like a night in the Mediterranean. 'However, I would not be in favour of people bringing new species in.' The chirping was not set to last too much longer, as Gryllus bimaculatus, commonly known as Mediterranean crickets, have a short life-span of just eight weeks. The insects’ native habitat is tropical and sub-tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Europe and they produce their distinctive chirp by rubbing their two outer wings together. James Hogan, curator at the Oxford . University Museum of Natural History, said: 'The problem with releasing . alien species is that you do not know what effect they may have. 'They might carry diseases. 'Gryllus bimaculatus make loud chirps, but I’m sure Mr Emlyn-Jones can buy CDs with cricket songs on instead.' Purchasing large amounts of insects over the internet - like Daniel Emlyn-Jones did - is perfectly legal. Many reptile owners use online suppliers to buy live food for their snakes and lizards. But releasing animals into the wild has the potential to be an offence if - as in this case - they pose a risk to the natural habitat. It is also legal to buy larger animals, such as a dog or cat, over the internet, though there has recently been a push for tighter regulation of pet-selling websites. On Wednesday the Pet Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) announced a set of minimum standards of animal retailers. The new rules came after reports of illegal animals such as arctic foxes and marmosets being advertised, as well as a slew of deals offering to 'swap' pets for items like mobile phones and watches. The new rules insist website must blacklist sellers who offer illegal breeds and species, end the practice of swapping pets for goods, and insist that sellers show they are properly licensed.","Daniel Emlyn-Jones, a private tutor and church warden from Oxford, liked the sound of crickets chirping, so filled his garden with them .

Passengers will be offered the chance to buy an all-inclusive ticket by easyJet for the first time in its 18-year history in a move that could signal a change in direction for budget airliners. The Luton-based firm has announced it is to start offering some passengers the opportunity to pay one price for their ticket, which will entitle them to choose their seat, place their bag in the hold, and pay by credit card. Up until now the firm has charged customers less than many of its rivals for the seat itself, but then boosted profits with a raft of costs for extra services, such as inflight food and drink, which other carriers include for free. Change: EasyJet is to charge one price for an all-inclusive ticket for the first time in its 18-year history . The airline claims its new all-inclusive fare will be lower than if customers had chosen to book all the extras on top of their standard ticket. To begin with, the deal will only be available to business travellers who book through corporate systems. But it is still being seen as a sign that the giants of the budget airline market could be about to change the way they do business. Some carriers, such as Irish firm Ryanair, even charge extra if customers book by credit and debit card when there is little alternative available. They argue that they are simply giving passengers the option to strip out extra costs that they do not need in order to secure the lowest possible price. Rival: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has argued customers should be given the option to strip out costs . EasyJet, one of the no-frills pioneers since it set up in 1995, is introducing an all inclusive fare in a bid to win more corporate travel bookings from big name rivals. They say that not only will the fare be cheaper than if customers were to buy each of the options separately, it will also be less time-consuming, a factor that might appeal to business travellers in particular. Head of sales Ruth Spratt said: 'We are really pleased to be able to offer an inclusive fare for the first time - part of our campaign to make ourselves easier to book and attractive to large corporates. 'It will help us to compete even more effectively with the legacy carriers as well as providing further choice and value for the 10million-plus corporate travellers who choose to fly easyJet every year.' Business customers will still have the choice of paying existing standard fares if they are not taking a suitcase or do not mind which seat they get. All-inclusive: The airline claims the cost of the ticket will still be cheaper than prices offered by rival carriers . Some of the extra charges invoked by budget airlines have caused an outcry in the past. Last year, Suzy Mcleod was furious after being charged £236 at Ryanair's check-in desk for printing out her boarding cards. Mrs MecLeod usually printed them at home, but had forgotten to on that occasion. When she set up a Facebook page asking people to support her if they thought she had been treated unfairly, 500,000 people gave her their backing. It did not cut any ice with chief executive Michael O'Leary, who branded her 'stupid'. Ryanair has also been banned from advertising flights without the tax included to give the appearance of a cheaper fare, although it does continue to give the pre-tax price on its website. Last month a flight from London to Ibiza was advertised for £42.99, although that rose to £95.79 once taxes and other costs such as web check-in and an EU levy are added. Both EasyJet and Ryanair have capitalised on charging people for food, which other airlines include within the cost of the ticket. EasyJet charges £6 for its all-day breakfast, £1.80 for a cup of tea and £2 for a Cup-a-Soup. Ryanair charges £2.50 for a cup of tea, £5 for a sandwich, and £5.20 for a small bottle of wine. Last month Mr O'Leary vowed to keep increasing the cost of placing luggage in the hold until nobody could afford to do it anymore. It now costs £50 to take place a 15kg bag in the hold for a return trip. EasyJet charges £26 for a 20kg bag. Mr O'Leary said by increasing the charges the number of passengers placing luggage in the hold had fallen to 19 per cent, saving the airline 'a fortune in money'. In an interview he even suggested he might consider charging for hand luggage at some point in the future. Both airlines charge customers extra to book using a credit card as opposed to a debit card. Typically this is about two per cent of the total ticket price with Ryanair, while easyJet charges slightly more at 2.5 per cent.","Business passengers to be offered chance to buy first all-inclusive ticket .

Paramedics found the man after they were called to the car park of the Seven Sisters Country Park in Sussex in the early hours of this morning. Police, who said that the woman, who is in her 70s, was taken to hospital suffering from 'injuries', are examining several theories including the possibility of a failed suicide pact. Police guard the scene after an elderly man was found dead at Seven Sisters Country Park in Sussex today . It is believed that the woman raised the alarm herself just before 2.30am today, calling emergency services to the remote spot on the edge of the Friston Forest, outside Seaford. Detectives said the couple were known to each other but they would not confirm that they were husband and wife. A Sussex Police spokesman said that the man died in the country park, which includes the Seven Sisters chalk cliffs and leads to Beachy Head, although they stressed the man was found within the park rather than near the steep cliffs.

Detective Sergeant Dave Tye said: 'To help us with our investigations we have closed a section of the Seven Sisters Country Park, along with the car park at Exceat.' A blue coloured police forensic tent could be seen erected at the scene of where the body was found. Police are in the process of contacting the man's next of kin, and said they believed the couple were not from Sussex but from elsewhere in the south-east of England.

But as US President Barack Obama outlined plans for missile strikes, Mr Hague last night walked up the red carpet with musicians, comedians and models. As Gallagher was named Icon of the Year by GQ magazine, he used his acceptance speech to question why one of the most senior members of the government had time to attend a celebrity party. ‘Welcome to the Tory party conference by the way,’ he said. ‘Is this what it’s like at the Tory party conference?’ Star-studded: The event was dominated by celebrities, including singer Rota Ora, Gallagher (centre) and comedian Russell Brand .

Scott Beecham had claimed he could not attend probation service appointments because he was unable to get out of bed after suffering a compressed disc in his spine . A thief who claimed to be bedridden with a bad back when he was in fact carrying out a seven month crime spree was caught out when he was seen swinging from a CCTV camera, a judge heard. Scott Beecham had claimed he could not attend probation service appointments because he was unable to get out of bed after suffering a compressed disc in his spine. But a court heard how at the same time, the 36-year-old was stealing thousands of pounds of stock from supermarkets. The defendant, who appeared at Guildford Crown Court using crutches, was also fit enough to swing from a CCTV camera before punching it, the court heard. Judge Peter Moss said he was left perplexed as to how Beecham could have carried out the offences after suffering such an injury. During the spree the defendant, from Leatherhead, Surrey, targeted supermarkets and the DIY chain B&Q stealing or attempting to steal more than £2,000 worth of goods. At the time he was in breach of a four week prison sentence, which had previously been suspended for two years. Judge Moss heard Beecham had doctor’s notes stating he was unable to attend probation appointments because his ongoing health problems had left him bedridden. The offences started on November 20 last year when he told a security guard in Sainsbury’s that he 'could have him with one punch'. The intimidated guard, who knew the defendant was already banned from the store in Leatherhead, Surrey, called the police. One month later Beecham approached the same security guard outside the supermarket and verbally threatened him. On February 7 he threatened a store detective as he tried to steal £270 worth of video games from a Tesco store in Reigate, Surrey. Beecham was then spotted attempting to steal eight X-Box consoles from Tesco in Weybridge, Surrey in March. In April he stole three television sets from Asda, worth £970 pounds. Scott Beecham admitted two offences under Section 4 of the Public Order Act, two counts of theft, criminal damage, common assault and breaching his suspended sentence at Guildford Crown Court (pictured) Just weeks later the former painter and decorator targeted a Tesco store in Worthing, fleeing with £278 pounds worth of video games. In June Beecham was witnessed jumping up and swinging off a CCTV camera at Tesco in Redhill before punching it. Also in June, he stole three power drills worth £449 pounds from B&Q. Beecham admitted two offences under Section 4 of the Public Order Act, two counts of theft, criminal damage, common assault and breaching his suspended sentence. Saul Herman, defending, claimed that Beecham had spiralled out of control after his ex-partner moved away with their children. 'At the time he was taking hard drugs that numbed the pain and made him more mobile,' he said. On sentencing Beecham to 14 months and two weeks in prison, Judge Moss said: 'You were seen jumping up at a CCTV camera outside Tesco and hanging from it before punching it. That showed considerable agility for one suffering with a bad back.'","Scott Beecham claimed he could not attend probation appointments .

The cottages situated on St Ann’s Head on the south west tip of Pembrokeshire in Wales used to be used as accommodation for lighthouse keepers. But they have been empty for over a decade since the lighthouse became automated. Consisting of four three-bedroom houses and one with two bedrooms, the whole row is on the market for £950,000. They are currently owned by Trinity House Corporation, which maintains all of the functioning lighthouses in England and Wales. Amy Thomas, of Cardiff-based chartered surveyors Cooke and Arkwright, said: ‘This is a fantastic opportunity to purchase a property in a unique and idyllic coastal location. ‘They offer a perfect opportunity for someone looking for a renovation project.’ It would be the perfect hideaway for anyone who has sung along to the song: 'I want to marry a lighthouse keeper...'

Earthquakes may contribute to global warming by releasing greenhouse gas from the ocean floor, a study suggests. Scientists uncovered evidence that a large earthquake in 1945 released more than seven million cubic metres of methane into the North Arabian Sea. The discovery exposes a natural source of greenhouse gas emissions that has not been considered before, they claim. Scientists have found evidence that a 1945 earthquakes released more than seven million cubic metres of methane into the North Arabian Sea . As a greenhouse gas, methane is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, but less abundant in the atmosphere. Enormous quantities of methane are locked in icy structures called hydrates on the floors of the continental shelves surrounding the Earth's land masses. An estimated 1,000 to 5,000 gigatonnes of carbon is trapped in methane hydrates - more than the total amount released by burning fossil fuels each year. Analysis of sediment cores taken from the North Arabian Sea in 2007 revealed chemical signs of large-scale methane release. A search of historical records showed that a magnitude 8.1 earthquake had occurred nearby in 1945. 'Based on several indicators, we postulated that the earthquake led to a fracturing of the sediments, releasing the gas that had been trapped below,' said lead scientist Dr David Fischer, from the University of Bremen in Germany. The study, published in Nature Geoscience, could show that earthquakes contribute to global warming . A conservative estimate indicated that roughly 7.4 million cubic metres of methane had escaped, said the researchers writing in the journal Nature Geoscience. 'There are probably even more sites in the area that had been affected by the earthquake,' Dr Fischer added. Methane hydrates have been suggested as a promising energy source, but mining them is expensive and risky. The hydrates help to stabilise the ocean floor, and there is a chance that disturbing them will trigger land slips and tsunamis.","Scientists find methane released into North Arabian Sea by 1945 earthquake .

A teenager who beat up an ambulanceman as he tried to treat a barely conscious woman at a house party has been jailed. Reece Richmond, 19, assaulted Gary Stacey with his older brother, Samuel, last April after the paramedic was called to a party the boys were at . Reece Richmond, 19, assaulted Gary Stacey when he was asked to leave the rowdy party in Nelson, Lancashire, last April. Mr Stacey, 59, suffered a black eye, gashed eyelid and a puncture wound on the inside of his cheek when Richmond and his older brother attacked him, a court heard today. Mr Stacey went to the house on Hollins Road, Nelson, with his colleague, Sarah Walsh, after a 999 call alerted emergency services to the party. Burnley Crown Court heard today how the drunk mother was vomiting into a bucket while her toddler lay on a sofa, surrounded by rowdy drinkers between the ages of 18 and 24. The woman, a tenant at the house, was only partially conscious when Mr Stacey and Ms Walsh arrived. In the interest of her two children's safety, the paramedics asked people who were at the party to go home. Prosecutor Richard Bennett said it was at this moment Reece Richmond launched the attack, after Mr Stacey threatened to call police. Richmond reportedly warned: 'Why have you said that? He’s going to kick off', before standing up and striking the ambulanceman in the face. His older brother, Samuel Richmond, 20, then . stood up and joined in the attack which took Mr Stacey's ambulance off . the road for four hours. Ms Walsh intervened and was able to get the victim to their vehicle before phoning police. Both brothers had fled the scene by the time officers arrived, but were later arrested. When questioned, Richmond accepted the paramedic was only trying to carry out his job, admitting his actions were uncalled for. The teenager said he wanted to apologise to the victim. His brother claimed he punched Mr Stacey after he had started to push him and he didn’t like it. Mr Bennett said: 'The ambulance was out of commission for four hours, presenting a risk to the general public.' The court heard how Mr Stacey was anxious, had trouble sleeping and was hesitant in attending certain jobs for some time after the incident, before both brothers admitted assault causing actual bodily harm. Richmond and his older brother, Samuel, appeared at Burnley Crown Court today where they were sentenced to 30 weeks in jail and 30 weeks in detention, suspended for one year, with 150 hours of unpaid work, respectively . Richmond, who has previous . convictions for affray and battery, was sentenced to 30 weeks in jail . while older brother, Samuel, received 30 weeks in detention, suspended . for a year, and was ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work. Julian . Goode, defending the latter, said his client had been shocked by his own . behaviour and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Martin . Hackett, for Reece Richmond, told the court his client accepted that . courts had a duty to protect public servants doing their jobs and knew . he would be going to jail. The incident occurred when Mr Stacey was responding to a call to a party on Hollins Road in Nelson (pictured) Mr . Hackett said: 'He accepts that he acted in a way which is wholly . contrary to that in which anybody should behave in a civilised society.' The . sentencing judge, Recorder Andrew Thomas, QC, said: 'Mr Stacey’s eye . injury was significant and it was a very serious offence. He had simply . been doing his job, putting himself in harm’s way. 'People . in that position, providing a service to the public, members of the . medical profession, are entitled to expect the courts to protect them . from offences of violence.' After . the case, PC Martin Vernon of Lancashire Police said: 'This was an . appalling attack on a man who only went to do his job and help someone . in need. He was set upon by the Reece and Samuel Richmond for no reason.' The 19-year-old admitted his actions were out of order and expressed a desire to apologise to Mr Stacey who suffered a black eye and gashed upper eyelid . 'Today’s sentence shows that we will not tolerate attacks or abuse against any member of the emergency services in the line of their duty. You will be brought before the courts and punished.' North West Ambulance Service Acting Director of Operations, Derek Cartwright, added: 'The violent and physical attack on our member of staff was absolutely unacceptable, and I fully welcome the custodial sentence given. 'The assaulted paramedic himself needed hospital treatment and, as a consequence, we had to allocate another emergency ambulance to treat the patient at the scene, when this resource could have been allocated to another emergency call. 'When paramedics attend the scene of any incident, they are there to provide professional medical attention to the patient, and should never be put in a position where they are subjected to any violence or aggression. 'We hope this sentence sends out a very clear message to anyone who assaults our crews - either verbally or physically - that they not only face the possibility of prosecution, but a prison sentence as well.'","Reece Richmond, 19, was sentenced to 30 weeks in jail .

Fabian Picardo an Oxford-educated lawyer and . leader of the Gibraltar Labour Party, has now asked David Cameron to send . vessels 'larger than the small craft it has now.' He accused Madrid of 'sabre-rattling' and behaving like North Korea after Spanish foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo's suggested introducing a levy on people crossing the border between Gibraltar and Spain. Plea: Gibraltar's chief minister has asked . Britain to send Royal Navy warships as tensions mount following the creation of an artificial reef in a small bay around the Gibraltar airport runway (file pictures) He told the Times: 'One of the issues that has been relevant has been that Spain has been making incursions with Guardia Civil launches into Gibraltar waters. 'With more naval assets it would be easier to show that these are British waters.' He added: 'It's about asserting British sovereignty in a peaceful way and demonstrating that the waters are British by filling them with British assets.' The latest row began after Mr Picardo . ordered the dumping of 70 concrete blocks into a small bay around the . Gibraltar airport runway in order to prevent Spanish overfishing of the area. Spain hit back by introducing time-consuming security checks at the . border post leading to huge queues and long delays for people travelling . from Gibraltar into Spain. Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo urged the government to 'demonstrate the waters are British by filling them with British assets.' Yesterday . Mr Picardo said 'hell will freeze over' before Gibraltar remove the . concrete which Madrid has claimed is harming Spanish fishermen adding . that any border costs would violate European Union freedom of movement . rules. Spain is also considering closing its airspace to flights heading to the Rock which Mr Picardo claimed would be a dangerous move saying it was the 'politics of madness'. British Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted the UK will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Gibraltar's people and  urged Spain to avoid increasing tensions further. Mr Hague added a political solution is needed to ease the current issues with Spain, while David Cameron's spokesman said the Prime Minister was 'seriously concerned'. Talk surfaced from Madrid  the British Mediterranean outpost through its border with Spain. Mr Garcia-Margallo suggested a proposed 50 euro (£43.30) fee imposed on every vehicle entering or leaving Gibraltar through Spain could be used to help Spanish fishermen who have lost out because of damage to fishing grounds. Mr Picardo told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme yesterday: 'The things that Mr Garcia-Margallo has said are more reminiscent of the type of statement you'd hear from North Korea than from an EU partner. 'We've seen it before during Franco's time during the 1960s but I think all of us hoped that those politics were never going to come back and that the much more enlightened politics of Mr Moratinos (Miguel Angel Moratinos), who was the previous but one foreign minister of Spain, would prevail, which talked about people working together and creating economic benefits for the citizens on both sides of the frontier rather than the belligerence we are seeing now.' European Commission (EC) spokesman Frederic Vincent confirmed controls on the Spain-Gibraltar border are allowed because the latter is not included in the Schengen Borders Agreement, which permits people to travel freely within the Schengen area of 26 countries. Mr Vincent said that these controls or sanctions must be 'proportionate'. He said the EC is studying the legality of Madrid's threat to impose a fee to cross the border between the two countries. The matter will be discussed at a future EC meeting, the spokesman said. Mr Cameron's spokesman said the potential levy by Spain had not been raised directly with the British Government. At a regular briefing for journalists in Westminster the Prime Minister's spokesman said: ""Clearly, we remain seriously concerned by the events at the Spain/Gibraltar border. 'Specifically on this issue of border fees, the Spanish have not raised the prospect of introducing border fees with us. We are seeking an explanation from them regarding reports that they might target Gibraltar with further measures.' Accused: Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Garcia-Margallo (left) has suggested introducing a 50 Euro charge for people crossing the border between Spain and Gibraltar while (right) David Cameron is said to be 'seriously concerned' by the situation . The Government is in 'close contact' with the Spanish about the issue, but the spokesman refused to give further details about what the next steps might be. The Prime Minister last spoke to his counterpart, Mariano Rajoy, about the issue at a European Council in June, before the latest developments. A Foreign Office source said officials were attempting to establish whether Mr Garcia-Margallo's proposals were genuinely being considered by the Madrid government or if they were a ""little bit of hot comment"". The Foreign Office has made clear that the UK expects Madrid to live up to the commitments it made in the 2006 Cordoba Agreement, which included deals on issues like border crossings and access for flights, as well as establishing a tripartite forum for regular dialogue between Britain, Spain and Gibraltar. Mr Garcia-Margallo's comments represent the latest moves in the dispute over the status of Gibraltar, following a number of alleged Spanish incursions into the territory's waters. Spain claims sovereignty over the Rock, which stands on the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula but has been a British Overseas Territory since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Delays: A woman gets out of a car as she waits in line to enter to the British territory of Gibraltar at its border with Spain . The UK Government has made clear that it will not negotiate over sovereignty as long as Gibraltar's people want to remain British. Spain's ambassador to the UK was summoned to the Foreign Office last week for a dressing down and to demand assurances that there would be no repeat of the excessive checks at the border which have caused lengthy delays. Shadow foreign office minister Kerry McCarthy described Spain's proposal to impose a border fee as ""unacceptable"" and said the Foreign Office should strongly reject it. And Sir Graham Watson, a Liberal Democrat MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar, said he had written to Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the EU Commission, about Mr Garcia-Margallo's comments. Sir Graham said: ""I am deeply concerned by Sr Margallo's latest comments, which follow months of harassment of my constituents by the Spanish government. 'The people of Gibraltar are as much EU citizens as those of Spain. As such, they have the clear legal right not to be discriminated against on the basis of where they are from; nor should their freedom of movement be restricted.' He added: 'I have asked the Commission to send observers to monitor the situation at the frontier.'","Fabian Picardo asked for a .

A Star Trek fanatic who spent thousands of pounds turning his flat into a replica of the Starship Enterprise was jailed today for downloading and passing on child porn. Tony Alleyne, 60, who kitted out his flat in Hinckley, Leicester, with a computerised flight deck, voice-activated lighting and a set of 'transporters' over his ten-year project, once claimed: 'Some people might think I'm a bit of a sad individual, but I'm not. I'm just really into Star Trek - it's my only vice.' But he was sentenced to 34 months in jail today after police discovered a 'massive' collection of more than 5,000 pornographic pictures involving babies, children and animals. Fanatic: Tony Alleyne featured in newspapers earlier this year after his ex-wife suggested selling his Star Trek flat . Alleyne, who is unemployed, had also distributed dozens of images - some rated at the most serious level five - Leicester Crown Court heard. The sci fi obsessive, who had given dozens of interviews and appeared on TV shows including MTV's Extreme Cribs and ITV's May The Best House Win, was picked up by an internet crime unit last autumn. 'Only vice': Alleyne made a name for himself - and his Star Trek pad - when he appeared on TV shows . Police raided his flat in September and seized computer equipment, although Alleyne refused to answer any questions in interview or reveal the passports to his five email accounts. Among the 5,083 pornographic pictures found on the computer after it was analysed were shocking sexual images involving babies and animals. Victoria Rose, prosecuting, said Alleyne was also discovered to have emailed 135 pictures to another paedophile. She added that when police were finally able to enter the email accounts Alleyne had refused to give access to, they found they had been deleted. But officers were able to recover a chat log between Alleyne and another man in which they discussed swapping child porn material. Alleyne was last in the media spotlight in January 2012, when his ex-wife tried to dismantle his Star Trek features - based on a mixture of the 1979 USS Enterprise and the starship Voyager from the 1990s series - to make the flat easier to sell. Among the features in the flat is a doorbell that 'rings' with a soundbite from Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). Alleyne has admitted ten counts each of making and distributing indecent images of children between January 2010 and September 2012. He also pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing extreme pornographic images involving animals. Judge Philip Head, sentencing, told him: 'Over a period of two-and-three-quarter years, you accessed child pornography in massive quantities. 'Without people like you consuming such material, there would be no market and these poor, desperate children would not be treated in such a way. 'You have shown no insight or remorse, save for being caught.' Alleyne was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely. Indecent: Alleyne was found to have more than 5,000 pornographic pictures on his computer in the themed flat .","Tony Alleyne discovered in posession of more than 5,000 pornographic pictures .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . PUBLISHED: . 22:15 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:05 EST, 6 September 2013 . Former BBC director general Mark Thompson has accused the chairman of the BBC Trust of 'fundamentally misleading' Parliament . Former BBC director  general Mark Thompson has accused the chairman of the BBC Trust of ‘fundamentally misleading’ Parliament over the severance pay scandal, leaked documents reveal. In an extraordinary submission to the Commons public accounts committee (PAC), he accused Lord Patten of peddling ‘specific untruths and inaccuracies’ over the extent of his knowledge of huge payoffs to senior executives. On Monday, Mr Thompson – who is now chief executive of the New York Times – will appear before MPs with Lord Patten to explain the debacle, in which departing BBC staff were paid £369million over eight years. In a 25-page statement provided to the committee this week, Mr Thompson challenged evidence given by his former colleague to an earlier hearing in July. Lord Patten has consistently denied the Trust was aware of the details of severance payoffs and has suggested the Corporation’s governance body was misled over the issue. But Mr Thompson said: ‘The picture painted for the PAC by the BBC Trust witnesses on 10 July 2013 was – in addition to specific untruths and inaccuracies – fundamentally misleading about the extent of Trust knowledge and involvement. ‘The insinuation that they were kept in the dark by me or anyone else is false and is not supported by the evidence.’ Mr Thompson claims to have emails showing Lord Patten was wrong to tell MPs he ‘didn’t know’ about two huge payments to departing executives – a £1.02milion payout to former deputy director general Mark Byford in 2011 and a £390,000 settlement reached with Sharon Baylay, the former director of marketing. Mr Thompson said that Lord  Patten was told both had received more than they were contractually entitled to. He said: ‘In fact, Lord Patten was himself fully briefed, in writing as well as orally, about the Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay settlements soon after his arrival as chairman in 2011.’ Mr Thompson also accused the BBC Trust of withholding key information from the National Audit Office’s investigation into severance payoffs. In a 25-page statement provided to the committee this week, Mr Thompson (right) challenged evidence given by his former colleague Lord Patten (left) to an earlier hearing in July . The BBC’s under-fire HR boss has admitted making a mistake in her evidence to Parliament over excessive pay-offs to senior staff. Lucy Adams initially told a hearing of the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that she had not seen a note detailing plans for pay-offs to deputy director general Mark Byford and marketing boss Sharon Baylay. But she has now admitted she helped write it. Ms Adams, who announced last month she was quitting the BBC, said in written evidence published today: 'During the July 10 hearing, the chair referred to a memo of October 7 2010. 'At the time, I was not clear which document the chair was referring to and so I could not recollect with absolute certainty whether or not I had seen the memo sent by Mark Thompson to the then chairman on October 7 2010. 'Since the hearing, I am now clear which document was being referred to and I can confirm that I was involved in drafting that memo, although I had not seen the final note sent to the Trust until recently.' He said evidence given to the NAO and the PAC in July was ‘inadequate, and in some important instances, very misleading testimony’. The public spending watchdog revealed this year that the BBC paid £25million to 150 departing bosses between 2009 and 2012. This week after further scrutiny of the BBC accounts, the NAO said the broadcaster paid out a total of £2.9million in payments that went beyond contractual entitlement between 2006 and 2012. In a humiliating U-turn on Wednesday, the BBC Trust was forced to reveal it had been shown a secret memo – codenamed Project Silver – detailing plans to pay Mr Byford far more than it was contractually entitled to. It is expected MPs will put pressure on Lord Patten to explain why the Trust, which has a responsibility to make sure the BBC meets its Charter obligations, failed to get a grip on the issue despite being made aware of the wrongdoing. Mr Thompson said: ‘The BBC Trust witnesses failed to mention the warning I had given them about misleading the PAC, or the extent to which they themselves had been briefed about these cases. Nor did they explain, given how much outrage they claimed to feel and how much they actually knew about the cases, why they did nothing about senior management severance until they themselves came under criticism for the payment made to [former BBC director general] George Entwistle.’ Speaking before details about Mr Thompson’s evidence to the committee had been made public, PAC chairman Margaret Hodge said she had seen evidence of ‘total chaos’ at the BBC. Asked by Radio 4’s Media Show if she thought the committee had previously been misled, Hodge said: ‘We will have to discover that next Monday. ‘Certainly those individuals we are having in front of us don’t agree with each other on what happened or who knew what and until we can unravel that we won’t know whether or not we were misled.’ Also giving evidence on Monday will be former Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons and Marcus Agius, the former chairman of the BBC Executive Board Remuneration Committee which was responsible for approving significant payoffs. Last night a BBC Trust spokesman hit back at Mr Thompson’s account, saying: ‘This is a bizarre document. ‘We reject the suggestion that Lord Patten and Anthony Fry misled the PAC. ‘We completely disagree with Mark Thompson’s analysis, much of which is unsubstantiated, in particular the suggestion that Lord Patten was given a full and formal briefing on the exact terms of Mark Byford’s departure, which in any event took place before the current chairman’s arrival at the Trust. ‘It remains the case, as noted by the NAO in its original report, both that the Trust under the chairmanship of Sir Michael Lyons was told that these payments were within contractual terms and that the Trust did not have a role in the approval process. ‘The Trust has already published its own account of events, which took place well before Lord Patten’s arrival, and we look forward to answering fully and openly further questions at Monday’s PAC hearing. ‘For Lord Patten and Anthony Fry the overriding concern remains the best interests and good standing of the BBC.’","Departing BBC staff were paid £369million over eight years .

Piantedosi chased Pulisciano into the bedroom and stabbed her with a butcher knife, prosecutors said. Edwards was still . logged into the video, the gruesome murder playing out in front of his eyes. 'He could hear the victim saying, . ""Please, please"". He could hear the daughter yelling, ""No. No"". He then . heard the defendant say, ""You gotta die. You gotta die"",' prosecutors told . the court at Piantedosi's arraignment. 'He then heard the victim say, ""Chris, please stop. I love you"" and then the defendant began stabbing Kristen numerous times.' Prosecutors said Pulisciano died of a stab wound to the neck as her two children watched on. Family: Kristen Pulisciano is pictured with her daughter, whose father is implicated in the fatal attack . Neighbours said the couple's children - the teenage daughter and a 20-year-old son - . fled the house, screaming that their mother had been killed after the horrific attack. 'She . was crying.

The tough new Press watchdog could be up and running in a matter of months after ‘very significant progress’ in setting up the regulator, it emerged yesterday. The newspaper industry is close to sending out contracts that will establish the Independent Press Standards Organisation and aims to have it launched in the early part of next year. Britain’s 200-plus newspaper and magazine publishers outlined details of the proposed watchdog two months ago, following the Leveson Inquiry into media standards. It will have far tougher rules than the previous regulator, the Press Complaints Commission. The watchdog will have the power to impose fines of up to £1million for systemic wrongdoing and can require editors to publish up-front corrections ‘whether editors like it or not’. Ipso will include a standards and compliance arm, with investigative powers to call editors to account. A majority of its members at all levels will be independent and there will be no industry veto on appointments to the body. Newspaper publishers say Ipso will be a ‘complete break with the past’ and will deliver all the ‘key recommendations’ made by Lord Justice Leveson. Paul Vickers, chairman of the industry implementation group – which includes representatives from across the national, regional, periodical and Scottish Press – said the group met this week to finalise the legal and contractual documentation that will establish the new press regulator. He added: ‘Very significant progress has been made. ‘A number of suggestions, both from  publishers and from other parties, have  been incorporated and the four key documents will shortly be ready for a final  consultation across the newspaper and magazine industry. 'Work is also well under way on the financing arrangements for Ipso, and the foundation group, under the chairmanship of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, is undertaking the task of selecting an independent appointments panel to appoint the first board. ‘We hope that we will therefore be in a position to begin signing contracts that will establish Ipso during late September and October, with a view to implementation of the new regulatory system, fully compliant with the Leveson principles, in the early part of the new year.’","Independent Press Standards Organisation is set to launch early next year .

Held: Victor Miller, 37, who was arrested for allegedly breaking in to Buckingham Palace, is currently being detained in a mental health unit . A suspected burglar arrested after being discovered in a royal state room at Buckingham Palace is being held in a mental health unit, it has emerged. DJ Victor Miller, 37, was found 'in an area currently open to the public during the day' after scaling a 12ft fence to get into the palace. Miller, from Bow, East London, was arrested for burglary, trespass and criminal damage on Monday and was last night being held in a mental health unit where he will stay for 28 days for assessment. The DJ, who claims to have worked with Amy Winehouse, N-Dubz and Tinchy Strider through his production company UK Artist Development, is believed to have been targeting priceless Coronation diamonds on display at the Palace. A spokesman . for the Metropolitan Police said: 'A man was passed into the care of . mental health professionals following bail'. They declined to comment . further. A security review has now been launched . and Scotland Yard is facing a major inquiry following the break-in. No . members of the royal family were present at the palace at the time of . the incident. A . second man, 38, was arrested outside the palace for conspiracy to commit . burglary following the incident shortly before 10.30pm on Monday. He has since been bailed. According to reports, police and security rushed to the palace after motion senors were set off. The . intruder is said to have made his way to the State Rooms where all the . Queen's priceless paintings by artists, including Titan Leonardo da . Vinci, and artefacts are kept. Break-in: A suspected burglar DJ Victor Miller has been arrested after being found inside Buckingham Palace . Target: It is believed Miller was targeting the diamond necklace the Queen wore on her coronation day which is currently being displayed in the State Rooms as part of an exhibit to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the event . There are 19 State Rooms which are open to the public during daily tours. Police are said to have found the man trying to smash a glass door in one of the rooms with a fire extinguisher. It is believed he was targeting jewels on display for the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation. The exhibit includes the necklace worn by the Queen on her coronation. It was made for Queen Victoria and features 25 diamonds set around a 22.48 carat Lahore diamond pendant. The ornamental crown made in 1820 for George IV which has a staggering 1,333 diamonds is also on display at the exhibition. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police . said: 'Both men have been bailed to return to a central London police . station and enquiries continue. Not present: The Queen has been spending her summer break at Balmoral Castle since the beginning of August . Security: A security review has now been launched following the break-in . 'A review of the specific . circumstances of this incident is being carried out. No members of the . Royal Family were at Buckingham Palace at the time of the incident.' A spokesman added that security would form part of the review. According to The Sun, a source close to the investigation said: 'This breach of security is being treated with the utmost seriousness.' The security breach at Buckingham . Palace, which is meant to be one of the best-guarded buildings in . Britain, has been described as 'alarming' by a former royal protection . commander. Breach: The break-in is one of the most serious security breaches at the palace since 1982, when Michael Fagan evaded guards and walked into the Queen's bedroom . Dai Davies, a former head of Metropolitan Police's royal protection squad, said the incident demonstrates that terrorists could enter the Palace. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It's alarming that as well as scaling the fence this individual managed to get inside the Palace itself before being stopped. 'Intruders should be apprehended well before this point. 'Questions will have to be asked about this incident at the highest level, particularly with regard to why the suspect appears to have gained entry to the Palace with such apparent ease. It is both disturbing and embarrassing.' Buckingham Palace have not commented on the incident. The Queen has been spending her summer . break at Balmoral Castle since the beginning of August and is not . expected to return to the palace until October. She is expected to make her traditional appearance at a Highland Games today. The Braemar Gathering is held each year just a short distance from the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire. The break-in is one of the most serious security breaches at the palace since 1982, when Michael Fagan evaded guards to get inside the Queen's private chambers while she was still in bed. The unemployed father of four, 31, spent around 10 minutes talking to the Queen after he climbed over the palace walls and up a drainpipe. The Queen managed to raise the alarm when Fagan asked for a cigarette, allowing her to call for a footman who held him until police arrived. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh attend church today. They were accompanied by Prince Charles . The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were in Aberdeenshire for the Braemar Gathering where they attended a church service this morning . The break-in at Buckingham Palace is the latest in a series of security scares involving the Royal Family. In March 2011 a car carrying the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall (below) was mobbed by demonstrators who had split from a protest against higher university tuition fees. Camilla was visibly distressed after being poked in the ribs with a stick through an open window in the distinctive Rolls-Royce Phantom VI as she and Charles travelled to the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium. In 2003, comedian Aaron Barschak managed to get into Prince William's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle. The self-styled 'comedy-terrorist' set off a series of alarms and was caught on CCTV before he joined 300 guests at the bash and was removed. In 1994, student David Kang charged at Charles while firing a starting pistol during a ceremony in Sydney, Australia. Kang was wrestled to the ground by New South Wales premier John Fahey and another man, while Charles was praised for his calm reaction. In 1981, six blank shots were fired from the crowd while the Queen rode during the Trooping the Colour ceremony. The Queen's horse was startled but she managed to bring it back under control while police rushed to grab the shooter. In 1974, Princess Anne was the target of an apparent kidnap attempt in The Mall near Buckingham Palace. Four people, including her bodyguard, Jim Beaton, were injured after shots were fired when their car was forced to halt by another vehicle which blocked their route. A police officer chased the driver, Ian Ball, and brought him to the ground before arresting him.

"By . Ap Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:43 EST, 8 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:11 EST, 9 September 2013 . An Arizona woman is getting her first taste of freedom in more than two decades after an appeals court overturned her murder conviction. A photo was published on crimefilenews.com of Debra Milke who is reportedly staying in a Phoenix home provided by supporters. She spent more than 20 years on death row for the death of her 4-year-old son. The photo shows Milke wearing a colorful short-sleeved top and smelling a rose. Free at last: After spending more than two decades on death row for the death of her 4-year-old son, Debra Milke is free and staying in a Phoenix home provided by supporters . Debra Milke walked out of the Maricopa County Sheriff's jail on Friday after supporters posted her $250,000 bond. The . 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned her conviction in March, ruling . that prosecutors should have disclosed information that cast doubt on . the credibility of a now-retired detective who said Milke confessed to . being involved in the killing of her 4-year-old son, Christopher. The 49-year-old Milke has not been exonerated, but a judge allowed her to could go free while she prepares for a new trial in a case that made her one of Arizona's most reviled inmates. Milke was convicted in the death of her son who authorities believe was killed for a $5,000 insurance payout. Police said Milke dressed the boy in his favorite outfit in December 1989, telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a mall before handing him over to two men who took the child into the desert and shot him. She had been imprisoned since 1990. 'Death Row Debbie': Debra Milke was released from prison today as she awaits a new trial in the 1989 murder of her son, Christopher . Doubt: The 9th Circuit agreed that there is some doubt about damning testimony given by a detective who single-handedly put Milke on death row . Prosecutors declined to comment on Milke's possible release and have not appealed the bond order. Milke, . whose mother was a German who married a U.S. Air Force military . policeman in Berlin in the early 1960s, has drawn strong support from . citizens of that nation and Switzerland, neither of which has the death . penalty. Max Krucker, . former president of the Swiss community where Milke's mother now lives, . said Renate Janka was 'ecstatic'  that her . daughter had been released. 'She . said, `Now I can finally hold my daughter in my arms again,'' he told . The Associated Press in a telephone interview from her home. For as long as Milke has been incarcerated, she and her mother have only met in situations where they were separated by glass. 'They were never able to touch,' Krucker said. A . dozen years ago, Krucker was among the organizers of an effort in the .

The account . eventually netted about 200,000 Swiss francs, or about $213,000 today. It's now nearly drained, he said. Tragic: Christopher Milke, seen here with his mother Debra, was shot in the head three times. He was just 4 years old . Doubts about Milke's guilt and deep suspicion about the reliability of the detective's testimony helped motivate Swiss supporters to donate, as did opposition to the death penalty. Many also had concerns that Milke didn't have access to the best defense because she had too little money, he said. Now supporters . are excited about the prospect of her release, Krucker said, but also . worried how she will manage to pay the bond. Janka, who is suffering from cancer, was already forced to sell her home to help cover her daughter's legal bills, he said. Supporters also run a website that requests donations through both German and Swiss accounts. Milke's . ex-husband, whose name is Arizona Milke, believes his former wife is . guilty and that supporters are fooled by the postings on the website. Killers: Jim Styers and Roger Scott admitted to murdering Christopher, and both currently are on death row . 'It's fed by propagandized lies,' he said on Friday. 'They write whatever they want and put it up there like it's true.' Her . chance at freedom comes six months after a federal appeals court . overturned Milke's conviction, ruling that the prosecution should have . disclosed information about the truthfulness of the now-retired . detective who testified that Milke confessed. Milke . was a 25-year-old insurance company clerk when her son was killed. She . has maintained her innocence, saying she had nothing to do with the . slaying. The two men . convicted in the case both remain on death row. Neither Roger Scott nor . former Milke roommate James Styers testified at Milke's trial. Scott . confessed during a police interrogation and led detectives to the boy's . body. Maricopa County . prosecutors are still seeking the death penalty against Milke at her . retrial, tentatively set for Sept. 30, and her alleged confession is at . the heart of the case against her. Police . detective Armando Saldate Jr. testified that she confessed to him in a . closed interrogation room. But the confession was not recorded. 'Confession': Detective Armando Saldate claims Milke confessed to her involvement in the murder - but it wasn't recorded and nobody witnessed it - other than Saldate . At trial, Milke denied that she had confessed, but the jury believed the detective. Doubts . about Saldate's honesty arose during Milke's appeals. The 9th Circuit . concluded in March that prosecutors' failure to turn over evidence . related to Saldate's credibility deprived Milke's attorneys of the . chance to question his truthfulness before jurors. 'No . civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy . evidence, quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or overzealousness, to . decide whether to take someone's life or liberty,' Chief Judge Alex . Kozinski wrote for the court. Crime Scene: This cross marks the spot in the Arizona desert where Christopher Milke was ruthlessly murdered . The . court noted four cases in which judges threw out confessions or . indictments because Saldate lied under oath and four instances in which . cases were tossed out or confessions excluded because Saldate violated . the suspect's constitutional rights. He . was also suspended for accepting sexual favors from a female motorist . he stopped and then lying about the encounter, the court said. Deputy . County Attorney Vince Imbordino argued last week during a bond hearing . that the purported confession is still admissible, but Judge Rosa Mroz . of Maricopa County Superior Court said the undisclosed material . concerning Saldate 'casts serious doubt' on its validity. Mroz, . who also set Milke's bond, scheduled a Sept. 23 hearing on the . defense's request to prohibit the prosecution from using the confession . during the retrial.","Deborah Milke's conviction was overturned in March .

A British man and his fiancée are thought to have drowned after he bravely tried to save her, Italian police said last night. Andrew Sturgess, 34, and his girlfriend Carmen Spiridon, 25, died despite the efforts of brave off duty lifeguards who pulled them from the sea. Officials said both victims were not strong swimmers and they were working on the theory that Mr Sturgess had tried to save Miss Spiridon after she got into trouble in an area of treacherous shifting sands. Tragic: The body of Andrew Sturgess on the beach in Tre Fontane near Campobello in south west Sicily . The alarm was raised after a woman on the beach at Tre Fontane near Campobello in south west Sicily, saw the motionless body of Mr Sturgess floating in the water face down. Her screams alerted bystanders, including the off duty lifeguards on the beach, who dived into the sea and pulled Andrew onto the sand and although they attempted to resuscitate him he was already dead. Minutes later Miss Spiridon's body was also spotted in the water but she too was also dead. The couple were due to fly back to their home in Stoke on Trent today after spending a week in Italy at the home of Miss Spiridon's mother, who is from Romania. Mr Sturgess was believed to be the manager of a hydraulic company in Stoke while his fiancée worked as a waitress and, according to local police the pair were engaged to be married. Today, Italian police said they were working on the theory that Carmen had got into trouble and Andrew had tried to help her but then both had got into difficulties and drowned. Captain Fabio Manzo - Italian police . Captain Fabio Manzo said: 'The alarm was raised by passers by who spotted the man's body first and then that of the woman. 'The area of beach is public and there are no lifeguards or watch towers but screams from a woman on the beach alerted two off duty lifeguards who dived into the water. 'They pulled the man's body out first and then tried to revive him but there was nothing that could be a done. A doctor was also on the beach and he confirmed death as well. 'Then a few minutes later the woman's body was spotted a short distance away and she too was pulled from the water but again she was dead as well. 'Both had water in their lungs and died from drowning. We are working on the theory that the woman got into trouble and the man went to rescue her but then both got into difficulties. 'We were called to the scene by passers by who had pulled the bodies from the water but a doctor of the scene confirmed they were both deceased and nothing could be done. 'The woman's mother lived locally and they were on holiday with her for the week. I have been to see her and she is obviously very upset. She told me they were engaged and due to be married.' He added: 'The water was not rough at the time but from what we have established neither was a strong swimmer and there are awkward currents in the area. 'They had been spotted playing around in the water just a few minutes beforehand. That area of coastline has a strange current and the sand is also very soft there.' Capt Manzo added that initially it had been difficult identifying the couple as they had no documents, although they did recover a medicine bottle with Andrew's name on it as well as his hometown printed on a label. However, it was only when Carmen's mother came into the local police station to report he daughter and her fiancé missing that the connection was made. The deaths were the third fatality involving Britons off the coast of Sicily this summer, with a 60-year-old man losing his life last month at Siculiana Marina on the east coast of the island.

Kennedy Jr. has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that wife Mary gave birth to their fourth child. Kennedy used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a mark out of ten. The list contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside them - which is believed to have signified that they had full intercourse. A 2001 diary belonging to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , pictured with late wife Mary, has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that she gave birth to their fourth child . Alongside more prosaic details of Kennedy’s political activism and family life, there are startling admissions of his own feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife. Time and again he writes of how he feels tortured by his ‘lust demons’ as he describes them. On days when he doesn’t cheat, Kennedy writes ‘victory’ to signify that he resisted sexual temptation. ‘I’m like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on Nov. 5, 2001. Kennedy, pictured at his wife Mary's graveside last year with their children, writes in his diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her . The thick, red journal was found at one stage by his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, who, distraught over their impending divorce and her husband's serial philandering, hanged herself in May 2012. The diary has since found its way into the hands of the New York Post. When a Post reporter questioned Kennedy on Friday about the diary they were first met with a stunned silence before he denied having kept a diary during that year. ‘I don’t think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001,’ said Kennedy. ‘I don’t have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.’ At the start of the journal the 59-year-old son of the assassinated U.S. senator announces that his wife was pregnant with their fourth child. Robert F. Kennedy Jnr with his late wife Mary Richardson Kennedy, left, in 2008 and, right, with girlfriend Cheryl Hines in 2011 . But soon Kennedy was writing about far seedier matters. He often writes as if he is the victim of the incidents and uses the word ‘mugged’ as shorthand for being seduced. ‘I narrowly escaped being mugged by a double team of [two women]. It was tempting but I prayed and God gave me the strength to say no,’ he writes on February 6. On May 21, he wrote that after hosting dinner for Leonardo DiCaprio, he drove the actor into Manhattan and met up with someone. He noted that he ‘got mugged on my way home,’ recording a 10 with the name of a woman next to it. ‘I’ve got to do better,’ he adds. In another entry, he said he needed to ‘avoid the company of women. You have not the strength to resist their charms’ and to ‘be humble like a monk. Keep your hands to yourself. Avert your eyes.’ Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail in July after getting arrested for trespassing at Camp Garcia, the United States Navy training facility on the island of Vieques. Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Navy training facility. He writes that incarceration temporarily freed him from the desires of his raging libido . He writes positively about his incarceration because it temporarily freed him from the desires of his raging libido. ‘I’m so content here,’ he writes. ‘I have to say it. There’s no women. I’m happy! Everybody here seems happy. It’s not misogyny. It’s the opposite! I love them too much.’ On July 8, just days before son Aiden was born, he writes lovingly about his wife: ‘I finally spoke to my wonderful wife and that was a joy. She is very strong and cheerful.’ ‘I’m so proud of my Mary. She has become the woman I fell in love with - through hard work. She has overcome her fears, enshrined her faith, abandoned self-pity and blame and immersed herself in gratitude and God gave her a baby... a beautiful and serene and happy soul. 'I am so happy. I couldn’t be happier or more grateful for the life and the wife God has given me.’ Robert Kennedy, far left, photographed in 2001 at a charity event for the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation. According to his secret diary, Kennedy had dalliances with three different women, including intercourse with one, during the evening . He also found time to contemplate his own weaknesses and his feelings of insecurity in trying to live up the legacy of his father. ‘After daddy died I struggled to be a grown-up... I felt he was watching me from heaven. Every time I was afflicted with sexual thoughts, I felt a failure. I hated myself. I began to lie - to make up a character who was the hero and leader that I wished I was,’ he writes on July 25. Near the end of his jail sentence he writes of a ‘three-point plan’ for ‘fixing my greatest defect... my lust demons’ - but he never writes with the plan is. By mid-August, he is out of jail and once again women’s names appear in the back of his journal. ‘I have been given everything that I coveted - a beautiful wife and kids and loving family, wealth, education, good health and a job I love yet always on the lookout for something I can’t have. I want it all,’ he writes. ‘No matter how much I have - I want more.’ November 2001 was an especially busy month for infidelities and he lists at least one woman’s name on 22 different dates, including on 13 . consecutive days. Three dalliances even occur on the same day - one is marked a ten - when he attended a black-tie fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria on Nov. 13 for Christopher Reeve’s charity.","A diary belonging to Robert F.

Dequan Breland, 23, shouted to a friend 'I shot that motherfu--er!' after firing a bullet into 16-month-old Antiq Hennis last weekend, investigators have revealed. The poorly aimed shot was meant for the dead toddler's father, a gang banger with a rap sheet over 20 offenses long. 'No you idiot, you shot the baby,' that friend replied. A distraught Mr Breland fled the scene, and the state. These details emerged as the slain toddler's funeral was held Friday. Suspects: Dequan Breland (left) and Dequan Wright (right) were taken into police custody in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on Friday in connection to a shooting in Brooklyn, New York on Sunday . Victim: Antiq Hennis was being pushed across a road in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Brooklyn by his parents at about 7.20pm yesterday when he was shot . These revelations come only a day after both Breland and accused accomplice Dequan Wright, 19, were discovered Friday in an Wilkes-Barre, PA apartment that belongs to Breland's cousin, according to The New York Post.

The zookeepers tried everything, from romantic music to a ‘love tunnel’ to get them together and in the mood for passion. But when the pandas once again failed to mate at Edinburgh Zoo, it was decided they needed even more of a helping hand. Now Tian Tian, the female panda, has been artificially inseminated in the hope there will be at last the patter of tiny paws. A zoo spokesman said last night she could give birth to cubs by the end of August. Britain's only giant pandas, Sunshine and Sweetie, had problems during their short mating season and needed help . The male panda, Yang Guang, nicknamed Sunshine in Scotland, was expected to mate with Tian Tian, known as Sweetie, during her 36 hour fertility window . Edinburgh zoo management said a successful mating season was critical. They need cubs for financial reasons. The annual bill for bamboo is £70,000 . The UK's only female giant panda (pictured) was inseminated after just two attempts to get her and Sunshine to mate naturally . The decision to inseminate Tian Tian – or Sweetie as she is called in Scotland – comes after just two attempts to get her and Yang Guang – or Sunshine - to mate naturally. The pandas come into season only once a year and then only for a window of 36 hours between mid April and May. It shows the desperation of the zoo management for panda cubs to fulfill their prediction that a million visitors will come to see their most high-profile animals. They need the numbers because it is costing the zoo £7 million to rent Sunshine and Sweetie for ten years, while the annual bill for bamboo is another £70,000 a year. In a statement yesterday, the zoo’s spokesman said: ‘Our specialist team and experts from around the world performed artificial insemination on female giant panda Tian Tian in the early hours of this morning. Natural mating was not attempted. Yang Guang had been interested and . shown consistently encouraging behaviour, however based on his many . years’ experience, our Chinese colleague Professor Wang felt that . although Tian Tian had displayed all of the correct behaviours, she had . also displayed signs that told him she would not be conducive to . mating.’ Hopes . had been high the two pandas would mate this year. The signs were good, . with Sweetie showing clear signals she was nearing mating season, . including grumpy behaviour and loss of appetite. Sunshine explores Sweetie's enclosure and stretches out on the grass. The pandas were swapped to explore each other's environments . Sunshine (pictured left) and Sweetie (right) were played love songs by Marvin Gaye to create an amorous mating environment . Surprisingly, Sweetie is the mother of two cubs back in China and Sunshine's father holds the world record for fathering 107 panda pups . Throughout the last week, keepers swapped the bears between enclosures to prepare them. They tuned in radio station Smooth FM, which frequently plays songs by Barry White and Marvin Gaye, to get them in the mood for love. The pandas were seen making eyes at each other through the grate separating them in the ‘love tunnel’ between their two enclosures. Sweetie was even heard crying out to Sunshine, who she arrived at the zoo with in December 2011. But ultimately, it seems, she just wasn’t in the mood. The zoo did not put the pandas together to even try and mate, because the animals can turn aggressive. Sweetie is the mother of two cubs back in China and Sunshine’s father holds the world record for fathering 107 panda pups so both are likely to conceive naturally. The two pandas were transported from China to Edinburgh in 2011 and are on loan for ten years . The zoo opted not to wait another year for the lucrative panda cubs. If Sweetie does become pregnant from the artificial insemination, it will take some time to find out. Giant pandas experience delayed implantation, which means the fertilised egg fails to embed for many days. Confirmation of whether she is expecting will come in mid-July when she will have an ultrasound scan. It is likely that her cub, or cubs, would be born at the end of August or the beginning of September. But for now the pandas are taking a break from the weight of public expectation and have been taken off display. The zoo’s spokesman said yesterday: ‘Both pandas and humans are sleeping today.‘The procedures went very much to plan and they are both well, but will be off show until Tuesday.’","Female panda, known as Sweetie, has been artificially inseminated at Edinburgh zoo and could give birth in August .

From the ground, the views could not be more picturesque, the epitome of England’s ‘green and pleasant lands’. But the idyllic landscape conceals an horrific past - a terrible massacre that took place in Iron Age Britain. Excavations in Somerset – at a vast ancient site near Yeovil - have unearthed evidence of a mass murder which could have involved thousands of people. Excavated remains of the heads and necks of three late Iron Age individuals thrown into an enclosure ditch, discovered at Britain's largest Iron Age hillfort, Ham Hill, Somerset . The excavations in Somerset have dug up evidence of a mass slaughter involving hundreds, if not thousands, of people nearly 2,000 years ago . Human fingers found in rubbish dump. Human remains from the ancient site near Yeovil have cut-marks, often in multiple rows, and at the ends of important joints . More gruesome still, some of the slaughtered bodies had all the flesh stripped from their bones (a practice known as ‘defleshing’) and were chopped up. This is suggested by the cut-marks, often in rows and at the end of major joints, found on the human remains. Dr Marcus Brittain, the Cambridge archaeologist, has headed a major excavation of Britain’s largest Iron Age hill fort, Ham Hill. ‘What’s uncharacteristic is the sheer quantity of them,’ he said. ‘It’s unusual to find this number of bodies on any archaeological site let alone from the Iron Age. ‘It could not be more different to the hill fort’s modern serenity of picnics and dog-walkers.’ Archaeologists at the site say some of the bodies were even defleshed and chopped up . A roundhouse entrance and two semi-articulated bodies in rubbish pits. Ham Hill is so vast - the size of 123 football pitches surrounded by Iron Age ramparts - that only a small part has so far been excavated . The remains are thought to date from the 1st or 2nd century AD, although the site had been occupied for thousands of years . The mutilation of the bodies suggests that they were ‘trying to separate pieces of the body’, thought to date from the 1st or 2nd century AD, according to Dr Brittain. The excavation has uncovered a tiny percentage of a site that spans the equivalent of 123 football pitches, enclosed by Iron Age ramparts. ‘If you were to walk along the ramparts on the outside of the hillfort, you’d be walking for over three miles,’ Brittain said. Most hill forts date from the first millennium BC to the Roman Conquest and excavations are rare because they are protected, ancient monuments. However, an exception was made at Ham Hill because the underlying stone is one of the most important building materials in southern England and is required for the conservation of historic buildings. Ham Hill site contains one of the most important stone materials in . southern England, used in the conservation of historic buildings in the . region . In return for the Ham Hill Stone Quarry being extended, an important archaeological investigation by the universities of Cambridge and Cardiff was funded. But the excavation has raised more questions than answers. The massacre is thought to have taken place around the start of the Roman invasion, and Roman weapons – sharp and heavy ballista bolts that would have been fired by catapult – were found among the bodies. ‘There was serious aggression on the hill,’ said Dr Brittain. One theory suggests that the Romans executed people to maintain order between indigenous tribes, but defleshing is rarely associated with them. Instead, it was a cult of violence to the dead among Iron Age Britons, who often put polished skulls in doorways. The archaeologists also excavated further into the interior of the fort, which will be open to the public for a day on Saturday September 7. There, they uncovered evidence of domestic life, including Iron Age and Roman pottery and ritualistic burials, and even arrangements of human skulls. They also found black mustard seeds which, Dr Brittain said, are normally associated with the Romans: ‘We’re finding it in abundance. It means that a new food type is being cultivated and gathered... either as a preservative or a spice.’","Remains discovered Britain’s largest Iron Age hillfort, Ham Hill, Somerset .

The 911 operator who answered the now-famous May 6th call from one of the women held for a decade by Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro was reprimanded on Friday for hanging up on her before police arrived. Public criticism was leveled against the operator's seemingly unsympathetic tone with the very excited Amanda Berry, once the audio of the call was made public by authorities. Berry made the call to police after she and her 6-year-old daughter, fathered by Castro, were rescued with the help of neighbors four months ago. Police then found Michelle Knight, who was abducted in 2002 and Gina DeJesus, abducted in 2004, in the home. Scroll down for videos . Happy: Amanda Berry, seen center with her sister and daughter at the hospital shortly after being rescued, was the one to call 911 and alert them to the house . Castro, who pleaded guilty in August . to raping, kidnapping and torturing the women, was found hanging from a . bed sheet in his cell Tuesday night. His body has since been claimed by . his family who are planning a private service and burial for the man who . was one month into a prison term of life plus 1,000 years. According . to a disciplinary letter sent to four-year veteran dispatcher Jack . Purdy, the City of Cleveland found he 'improperly handled a 911 call . from a kidnap victim and failed to remain on the line with the victim . until responding officers arrived on the scene.' The . dispatcher had pleaded 'no contest' at a hearing last month. On Friday, . he was informed that a letter of discipline would be placed in the his . personnel file for three years. Dead: Ariel Castro's body is set to be claimed by his family today after he hanged himself in his prison cell on Tuesday . Bureau . of Communications Commander Thomas Stacho said in the letter to Purdy . that he could have demonstrated ""more empathy and could have been more . compassionate in your dealing with Ms. Berry."" In . a recording of the 911 call, Berry is heard telling the operator, 'I've . been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, . I'm free now,' and seemingly pleading with the operator 'I'm Amanda . Berry. I've been on the news for the last 10 years,' with the dispatcher . responding, 'I got, I got that, dear.' 'Without . question, you should have kept her on the line as I believe that that . simple, required act would have enhanced her sense of safety,' Stacho . said. It came after MailOnline revealed on Tuesday that Castro's . victims have mixed feelings about the suicide of the man they spent ten . years of their life with due to the warped bond they shared with him. Freed: Amanda Berry, left, Gina DeJesus, center, and Michelle Knight, . right, have all spoken out about recovering from their horrific ordeal . being kidnapped, raped and tortured by Castro. They have declined to comment on his suicide . Relatives . of Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight said the girls are happy they can . finally put the traumatic episode beside them but also experienced some . confusion when they heard the news. Jackie Figaro Roman, an aunt of Gina DeJesus, told MailOnline that both girls were going through a ‘mixture of emotions’. She . said: ‘There’s so many mixed feelings about it. Gina is a little . confused. We are trying to protect her because we have to remember, she . was a 14-year-old girl (when she was kidnapped). 'But Gina and Michelle won’t have to think about him because he’s not around any more.’ She also revealed that Gina’s mother Nancy has been able to move beyond her anger and is already pitying Castro. 'Nancy probably feels bad for him. We . have a very strong, spiritual family and so does Ariel Castro. She . doesn’t care about him, she’s just happy her daughter is home. She . doesn’t feel any anger.' Amanda Berry - whose daughter is fathered by Castro - has also not commented on his death. Though . Castro serially abused the women physically, emotionally, and sexually . on a daily basis, they were also so badly manipulated they developed . 'Stockholm syndrome' - slowly 'bonding' with their captor in gratitude . for rare small favors he would grant them. His suicide will have come as a slap in . the face to his victims and their families, robbing them of . the justice that had brought some form of closure to their ten-year . nightmare. Lonely death: This is an isolation cell at Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, like the one where Castro hanged himself Tuesday . Castro . was being housed alone in an isolation unit for his protection, where . he would be checked every 30 minutes.  Prison officials said he hanged . himself with a sheet during a break between inspections. Initially, . Castro was being checked on every ten minutes, but this stopped in June . after he was deemed not to be a risk to himself and taken off suicide . watch. An autopsy confirmed his death was suicide by hanging. Castro's attorneys tried . unsuccessfully to have an independent psychological examination of the 53-year-old . done at the Cuyahoga County Jail before he was turned over to state . authorities following his conviction. A full investigation is underway as . to how he was able to take his own life while under the watchful eye of . prison guards - who said he was always calm and cooperative with them. While . his defense attorneys said they are suspicious as to why their client . would have committed suicide just one month into his prison term, . Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty issued a scathing . statement. 'These degenerate molesters are cowards. They con and capture vulnerable . children,' he said. 'This man couldn't take, for even a month, a small portion of . what he had dished out for more than a decade. 'Let . this be a message to other child kidnappers: There will be a heavy . price to pay when you are caught. You won't enjoy the captive side of . the bars.' House of horrors: This is the four-bedroom home where Castro kept his victims for a decade - unbeknown to his family or his neighbors . Restraints: A rusty chain can be seen over a dirty mattress on the floor of the room Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight shared . Basement: The pole the girls were all chained to and raped many times throughout their time in captivity is pictured . As well as his four elder children, . Castro fathered a young girl to victim Amanda Berry. It is unclear if . the child knows her father is dead. Castro . was jailed after keeping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight . captive in unimaginable conditions in his house for ten years. When prison guards found Castro hanging in his 8x12 foot cell on Tuesday, they immediately began trying to resuscitate him. He . was taken to Ohio State University Medical Center, where he was . pronounced dead about an hour and a half later - shortly before 11pm. It . costs nearly $25,000 a year on average to house a prison inmate in . Ohio. The cost to house Castro, who was kept in high security, would . likely have been much higher. Castro's family - he has a son and three daughters by his ex-wife - were informed of his suicide about 1am. A . spokeswoman for the the Ohio Department of Corrections said the agency . will make a full investigation of Castro's suicide to determine whether . regulations were followed and if anything could have been done to . prevent his death.

A political earthquake rocked the Kremlin last night as exit polls showed Vladimir Putin’s most charismatic foe making a sensational showing in Moscow’s mayoral elections. Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny scored around one third of the vote against the incumbent in exit polls, a result far in excess of expectations. Bland technocrat Sergei Sobyanin, a leading Putin acolyte, appeared to be edging towards victory in the first round but only by a whisker. Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, with his wife Yulia, center, daughter Daria, and son Zakhar arriving at the polling station in Moscow's mayoral election yesterday . And Navalny’s team claimed Sobyanin had failed to clear the 50 per cent threshold for first round victory and that a run-off should be held. Although far short of victory, it is a remarkable showing in the context of Russian elections - and gives huge hope to the opposition for the years ahead. Navalny made his name as a campaigner against alleged vote-rigging by Putin’s United Russia Party in recent elections, and has led street demonstrations against the ruling elite. He has made clear he wants to jail Putin and his henchmen for alleged corruption. Sobyanin, backed by the vast state apparatus, had been expected to trounce the 37 year old lawyer and blogger who faces a five year jail sentence on what he deems politically-motivated charges linked to a business deal. Other ideas: Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured casting his ballot paper at a polling station in Moscow yesterday . But the polls suggest one of the most extraordinary election results since the fall of the Soviet Union. They are due to hold a rally tonight to protest the result. Kremlin appointee Sobyanin scored 52.5 percent of the vote while Navalny achieved 29.1 percent, according to state-backed FOM polling group. Another polling group put Sobyanin on 53 per cent and Navalny 32 per cent. The margin or error is three per cent. Navalny’s aides claimed he had scored 35.6 per cent, against 46 per cent for Sobyanin, a result which would mean a run-off. The official count will go ahead today. Our exit poll data undeniably show that there will be a second round of this election,’ said Navalny. Even a state-funded news agency dubbed Navalny’s performance as ‘staggering’.","Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny scored around one third of the vote against the incumbent in exit polls .

The daughter of a Navy vet killed by an Ohio drunk driver says her father’s confessed killer was just trying to avoid a harsh jail sentence by confessing in a YouTube video that has since gone viral. Angela Canzani believes Matthew Cordle, who says he hit and killed Vincent Canzani, 61, on June 22 in, was ‘totally misleading’ with his confession because he was already suspected of the crime. The accusation comes just a day after Canzani’s own ex-wife applauded Cordle’s decision to confess, calling him an ‘honest man.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone . Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident . ‘There was a traffic cam. There was a . third car involved,’ Canzani told NBC News. ‘So people are kind of . looking at this like he’s just coming out of nowhere…Like he’s some hero . or something.’ A hero is exactly how Canzani says her father’s confessed killer is hoping to appear. Cordle . has not yet been charged, but likely will be charged with aggravated . vehicular homicide with an alcohol specification, which carries a . maximum of eight years in prison upon conviction. ‘It’s . making it look like he’s confessing to a crime,’ Canzani said of . Cordle’s video, which was released this week to promote a not-for-profit . web start up called 'Because I Said I Would' which promotes the use of . 'promise cards' where individuals set goals for themselves. Though Cordle has received widespread praise since his confession hit YouTube, Canzani remain dubious. Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left) ‘If . he wanted to raise awareness, I mean, I would’ve commended him for that . down the road, but the video is totally misleading. The motives, I . believe, are so he’ll get a lighter sentence. ‘There’s a way to go about it and that wasn’t it.’ On Friday, the . ex-wife of Mr Canzini told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of . Cordle - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor. Cordle . says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his . truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr . Canzani, of suburban Columbus. Throwing stones? Angela Canzani, pictured here in an undated Ohio mugshot, says her father's confessed killer is no hero and is only looking to lighten his jail sentence . The . video begins with Cordle's face blurred as he describes how he has . struggled with depression and was simply trying to have a good time with . friends going 'from bar to bar' the night of the accident. Cordle's face becomes clear as he reveals his name and confesses to killing Mr Canzani. 'When . I get charged I'll plead guilty and take full responsibility for . everything I've done to Vincent and his family,' Cordle says. Later, . he says he understands that by releasing the video he's giving . prosecutors 'everything they need to put me away for a very long time.' The . video was released in connection to a start-up called Because I Said I . Would, a non-profit aimed at encouraging individuals to stay true to . their personal commitments. Since leaving the Navy, he flourished . as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three . great grandchildren. Today, . Cheryl Olcott, who was married to Mr Canzani for 10 years, said that . she is praying for him - and even forgave him for not coming forward for . two months. Mrs Olcott, . said: 'I applaud Matt for stepping up to the plate. He's taken full . responsibility. He is an honest man who has spoken the truth. It's . unfortunate that the whole cycle of events has happened this way. I pray . for Matthew Cordle.' Asked if she would have preferred it if Cordle had admitted his guilt right away, she said: 'You can't change what's happened, that's all I know. I'm not a judge. There's only one judge and that's the big guy upstairs. Matthew is a good man. I commend him for that'. Mrs Oclott, who love in Norwalk, Ohio, said she'd followed the case closely and remembered their time together fondly. 'There were a lot of good times,' she said. Problems: The county prosecutor said that Matthew Cordle was considered a suspect in the case but had not been charged. In light of the video, he will presumably be charged with aggravated vehicular homicide . She added Mr Canzani was an only child whose parents have died and said that he was estranged from his two grown-up daughters. She said: 'He had no-one. He hasn't spoken with his daughters his whole life. He didn't raise them.' Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien on Thursday said Cordle was a suspect in the deadly crash but hadn't been charged. O'Brien said he saw the video on Wednesday and will ask a grand jury to indict Cordle for aggravated vehicular homicide. O'Brien said Cordle's blood sample from the night of the crash tested positive for alcohol and negative for drugs. In the video, Cordle says that at the time of the accident he consulted with some ‘high-powered attorneys who told me similar cases where the drivers got off.’ ‘They were convinced that they could get my blood test thrown out and all I would have to do for that was lie,’ he said. His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video . Defense attorney George Breitmayer III said the video 'is a strong testament' to Cordle's character. He said Cordle intends to co-operate with prosecutors. Police in June said Canzani, of Gahanna, died at the scene after his Jeep was struck on Interstate 670. Cordle ends the video confession by 'begging' viewers to not drink and drive. 'I can't bring Mr Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,’ he said. The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards. A fan: Cleveland kidnap victim Gina DeJesus posed for a picture with the group's shirt after the founder met with her mother . Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'. The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises. In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run. 'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post. 'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.' Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. After the three young women were . discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to . launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor. Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found . Big finish: He ended the walk by being greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother at the site of the 'House of Horrors', which is just six miles away from where Sheen lives . He said that he lives six miles away from the now-razed 'House of Horrors' and was moved by the girls' perseverance. He used the walk as a way to raise awareness about sexual assault, and at the end, he was greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother. Mr Sheen gave her a number of t-shirts with the organization's name printed on them, and in return, she later sent him a picture of Gina wearing the shirt.","No 'hero': Angela Canzani says Matthew Cordle was already part of the investigation and wasn't 'coming out of nowhere' as she says the video implies .

Suffering from dementia, 76-year-old Bennie Coleman was kicked out of the home after forgetting to pay a $134 property tax bill that grew to a nearly $5,000 debt through a predatory tax system. The foreclosure happened after Coleman's tax debt was sold by the government at auction as a tax lien to a private purchaser in Maryland. The owners of his lien then charged him interest, adding expensive legal fees into the mix - eventually bringing the total owed to $4,999. 'I have nothing': 76-year-old Bennie Coleman walking by the house he used to own in Washington, DC before the owner of his $134 tax lien foreclosed it and kicked him out . His home was one of 200 foreclosed in recent years by tax lien owners who often come from out of state to buy the debts at auction - a system The Washington Post has been investigating for the past 10 months. Coleman's original debt started in 2006 when he forgot to pay a $134 property tax bill. When he didn't pay that bill, the city put a lien on the debt and added on $183 in interest and penalties. Coleman's son paid $317 to erase the debt in 2009 - but by then it was too late. A Maryland company had bought the lien and raised the debt to $4,999. His son wrote the court, saying he couldn't pay that much. 'I would hate for him at this age to lose his home,' he wrote. So he made another payment of $700, but then stopped. With no further payments, the court approved a foreclosure in June 2010. The following summer, federal marshals appeared at Coleman's door to forcibly remove him from his home. Unaffordable: Once the government sold his debt to a private purchaser, they charged him interest and added on exorbitant legal feeds which brought the new debt to nearly $5,000 . Unfortunate: The Post investigation also found other cases where the elderly or terminally ill were being foreclosed on for debts less than $1,000 . He watched from across the street as his entire life's possessions were kicked to the curb. Movers were hired to liquidate the home of is easy chair, clothes, his television - even his Marine Corps medals and pictures of his wife Martha who died of breast cancer in 1988. With no where to go, Coleman slept in a chair on his front porch that first night. Now, he lives in a group home a mile away from his former home. Forced to leave his home and part with all his possessions, Coleman told Post reporters: 'I have nothing'. After the foreclosure Coleman was given a court ordered conservator who has been helping him fight for his home, which was sold for $71,000 two months after his eviction. 'He had no chance' attorney Robert Bunn said. 'He has dementia. He did not understand the ramifications of what was going to happen to him .' The Post investigated the district's tax lien program for 10 months and found that the lien program in the district got out of control when lien owners were allowed to start charging legal fees. These fees quickly escalated small debts like Coleman's into something unmanageable. All over $134: Now Mr Coleman lives in a group home about a mile from his old home . In fact, the Post found that of the 200 homes foreclosed in recent years, one in three of the liens were debts less than $1,000. While other cities and states have instituted rules on liens, such as capping fees and protecting homes of the elderly - the safeguards in Washington weren't as rigid which is why they attracted buyers from out of state. Some of these purchasers have been accused of rigging tax auctions to win certain liens in other states. In addition to Coleman, the Post discovered several other cases of the elderly or sick losing their homes over a petty debt. A 65-year-old flower shop owner was dying of cancer in hospice, when a lien company in Florida foreclosed his home of 40 years after he failed to pay $1,025 in back taxes. Another case involved a 95-year-old church choir leader who was kicked out of her house over an original tax debt of $44.79 while she was in a nursing home for Alzheimer's.","Bennie Coleman, 76, lost his home two years ago after forgetting to pay a $134 property tax bill .

George Zimmerman's wife is asking that he pay for a permanent life insurance policy with her named as the beneficiary, according to a divorce petition made public Friday. Shellie Zimmerman said in the petition that her husband should pay the premiums on the policy since he ""has the financial ability to obtain such life insurance at reasonable rates. 'She also asked for custody of the couple's 2-year-old Rottweiler, Oso, and 8-year-old Leroy, a mixed-breed dog.' They have no children. Shellie Zimmerman, 26, is seeking an equal distribution of their checking accounts, trusts, partnerships and any unknown assets, and asked that a judge prevent him from selling off any property. Among the unknown assets is any money George Zimmerman may get from a defamation lawsuit he has filed against NBC. Scorned: Shellie Zimmerman says supporting her husband caused her to neglect herself . Invincible: Shellie Zimmerman says her husband feels invincible since he was acquitted of murder in Trayvon Martin's death . The couple, who have been married since November 2007, separated a month after Zimmerman was acquitted in July of any crime for fatally shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012. The Zimmermans aren't living together as husband and wife, said the petition, which suggested Shellie may seek legal fees from her husband for the divorce. 'The marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken,' the petition said. In an interview with ABC's Good Morning America that aired Friday, Zimmerman said her husband left her with ""a bunch of pieces of broken glass"" after the acquittal.

'I have a selfish husband and I think George is all about George,' she said. Last week, Shellie Zimmerman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge for lying about the couple's finances during a bail hearing following her husband's arrest after Martin's shooting in Sanford, Fla. George Zimmerman, 29, said he acted in self-defense when he killed Martin and the polarizing case opened up national discussions on self-defense laws and race. Martin was black.

Shellie Zimmerman was sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. Her husband did not attend the sentencing hearing in the Sanford courtroom. 'I stood by my husband through everything,' she told ABC, 'and I kind of feel like he left me with a bunch of pieces of broken glass that I'm supposed to now assemble and make a life.' Shellie Zimmerman says her husband was verbally abusive toward her and that he has been making what she considers 'reckless decisions.' She didn't specify what those decisions were. ""In my opinion, he feels more invincible"" since his acquittal, she added. She said the timing seems right to begin a new life. 'I have supported him for so long and neglected myself for too long,' Shellie Zimmerman said.

Elegantly dressed, dripping with jewels and stunningly beautiful, India's pantheon of goddesses holds a special place in the heart of the country's Hindu majority. But one ad agency has turned the concept upside down by unveiling a hard-hitting campaign that depicts Lakshmi, Durga and Saraswati as the victims of domestic abuse. Described by commentators, including the team at Scoopwhoop.com, as something that 'needs to be taken more seriously', the shocking images are intended to highlight the plight of India's most vulnerable women, including victims of human trafficking. Appalling: This striking image depicts Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, as a battered domestic violence victim . The text accompanying the shocking images reads: 'Pray that we never see this day. Today, more than 68 per cent of women in India are victims of domestic violence. Tomorrow, it seems like no woman shall be spared. Not even the ones we pray to.' Although the horrific gang rape and murder of student Jyoti Singh last December caused outrage across the world and intensified Indian government efforts to get to grips with endemic domestic violence, little is known about human trafficking. According to Save the Children India, which commissioned the images to promote its Save Our Sisters anti-trafficking initiative, trafficking of young girls and women for sexual exploitation is all too common. Along with campaigning, the charity hopes to tackle the problem through its Sahas Kendra Livelihood Programme, which helps victims of trafficking to overcome their experiences through counselling while also providing them with education and life skills needed to keep them off the streets. Ironic: Durga, the goddess of good triumphing over evil, sports a black eye and a bloody lip in this image . Horrifying: Saraswati, goddess of knowledge and arts, also features alongside wealth goddess Lakshmi . Supportive: Designers Lavinia Brennan (left) and Lady Natasha Rufus-Isaacs of Beulah, a label - and cause - also supported by both Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge and her sister Pippa Middleton . Other initiatives include workshops set up to employ trafficking victims and give them a new future in the garment industry - two of which are supported by Beulah London founder Lady Natasha Rufus-Isaacs who has seen the plight of India's exploited women and girls first hand. 'Both Lavinia [Brennan] and I witnessed the effects of human trafficking in India 2010 when we worked in local slum schools, and at an aftercare home with trafficked girls,' she reveals. 'It opened our eyes to this horrific crime, and we were shocked at that this sort of modern-day slavery still goes on. 'It's one of the largest crimes in our society today - more so than trafficking drugs. Drugs can be sold once but human beings can be sold over and over again, it is an extremely lucrative market.' Beulah works with anti-trafficking organisations Freeset and Open Hand in Delhi and Calcutta, which produce canvas bags and some garments for the label. Rufus-Isaacs added: 'We launched Beulah London in 2011 to help provide a sustainable livelihood to those that have come out of sex trafficking. 'The name Beulah represents the journey of woman coming out of despair into a new life of hope and restoration. 'We fully support the Abused Goddesses campaign, and its aim to raise awareness of human trafficking. 'The imagery is powerful and moving, and we hope it will help prevent and protect many women from being trafficked in the future.'","The images were commissioned by Save the Children India .

The thief shown in surveillance footage stealing a disabled boy’s wagon returned to apologize. At least one of the two young women filmed stealing a six-year-old disabled boy’s wagon early Tuesday morning from the front yard of his Belmar, NJ., home felt guilty. One of the thieves returned Friday morning to apologize for the heartless theft. Not only did she apologize, but she also bought a new wagon, according to Belmar Patch. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE VIDEO . Dynamic duo: The two young women caught on camera stealing a disabled six-year-old boy's wagon . Shown on numerous television stations in the area after the footage was uploaded to YouTube by distraught father Jim Bean, the theft shocked the small beach resort town one hour south of New York City. The media blitz must have struck a chord, because one of the women returned Friday morning with a brand new, still-in-the-box wagon and a written letter of apology to young Alex Bean. ‘She apologized profusely for the theft,’ mother Tracy Bean told Patch. ‘She said she was sorry… she wasn’t thinking.’ The wagon burglar didn’t know where the stolen wagon was, lost to a night of recklessness, but did replace it, Tracy Bean added. How could they?: The theft of Alex Bean's wagon shocked the small beach resort town of Belmar, NJ . ‘I’m moved to tears,’ said the mother, ‘All is right.’ Explaining that the remorseful robber could not have been more apologetic, the happy mother declined to identify the woman. ‘She was very sincere,’ Tracy Bean told Patch. ‘She said they just didn’t think about it at the time.’ The family was featured in several new reports earlier in the week pleading for their son’s wagon to be returned, saying it was his favourite toy and that he was distraught over its disappearance. ‘I think he wants his wagon back, it's a little kid toy, come on,’ Jim Bean told WABC earlier in the week. Caught in the act: The two thieves are shown entering the Bean's property at left, with one of the girls tossing the wagon over the fence (right) Alex Bean suffers from cerebellar hypoplasia, a rare neurological condition that stops him from being able to walk or speak . ‘My son has a very rare neurological condition where he was born with parts of his brain missing,’ Tracy Bean told WINS. The family took their son around the picturesque town in the wagon, instead of a wheelchair, so he felt more normal. ‘You look at my son, he's handicapped, he's in a wheelchair’ the angry father told WABC. ‘When he's in the wagon, he's a little more normal, you know? He's looking around, he's not strapped in, sitting up tight.’ Relieved: Father Jim Bean (L), Alex Bean (C) and mother Tracy Bean (R) are satisfied with the girl's apology and new wagon, they will not press charges . The wagon bought to replace it was exactly the same. ‘That wagon was great because it supported his back and he had plenty of room,’ Tracy Bean told WINS. ‘The one [the thief] brought us is the same — it had the bucket seats, it has the seatbelt and he has plenty of room. That’s all my son needed.’ The family has said that all is forgiven and that they will not press charges. 'I think the two women have been through enough after the video went viral, so we didn’t want to press charges,' Tracy Bean told the Asbury Park Press. More importantly, a young boy got his favorite toy back. 'As long as my son is satisfied and happy, then I have no problem at all,' Jim Bean told the paper.","Alex Bean, 6, has a rare brain disorder that leaves him unable to speak or walk and confines him to a wheelchair .

Grown tired of climbing a 30-foot ladder to his treehouse, Ethan Schlussler decided he needed to invent something that could take him up in a fraction of the time. The inventive 22-year-old from Sandpoint, Idaho, quickly hit upon about the idea of developing a bicycle-powered ‘elevator’ which now allows him to pedal himself up in 30 seconds flat. Once Ethan had hit upon the ingenious idea, it took him a couple of attempts to get his unusual elevator just right. Scroll down for video . Ready to go: Ethan Schlusser sits on his bicycle and starts to peddle . Up, up and away: As he starts to pedal Schlusser quickly ascends to his treehouse 30 foot in the air . At first the bicycle traveled too quickly, so Schlussler had to reduce its speed by getting rid of the de-railers, making a new chain tensioner and welding the front sprocket to the rear. ‘As soon as we came up with the idea, I knew I had to make it a reality,’ Schlussler told ABC News. ‘It would be so incredibly fun and whimsical.’ After developing the basic idea in his head, Schlussler set about modifying his bicycle by welding pieces of scrap metal to the frame so he could attach points and pulleys. ‘After the first trial run, it became clear that the gear ratio was not nearly low enough, as I could not even pedal it up the tree at all.’ Much easier than taking the stairs: In no time at all Schlusser has arrived at his treehouse . Going down: Schlusser's weight and gravity mean it is even easier going down than going up . ‘First, I changed the gear ratio on the bicycle by swapping a large front sprocket to the rear, which was still not quite easy enough to pedal, so I added a pulley into the system to gain a bit more [mechanical] advantage,' he said. 'Once I had the counterweight adjusted, it worked better than I could have hoped.' To counterweight the bicycle, Schlussler has used an old water heater tank which can be adjusted by simply adding or removing water. The process of constructing the bicycle elevator took less than a week. Schlussler is still finishing construction on his tree house that he can now more easily access via his bicycle. He plans to install walls and insulation in the next few weeks, with the ultimate goal of sleeping and, perhaps eventually, living full-time in his 30-foot high outdoor home.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:52 EST, 7 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:23 EST, 8 September 2013 . Prim and proper: Miss America 2011, Teresa Scanlan, is now attending the ultra-conservative Patrick Henry College in Purcellville, Va. The contrast is startling: from a bikini-clad 2011 Miss America, Teresa Scanlan has transformed into a prim and proper student at the ultra-conservative Patrick Henry College. The school requires students to dress modestly and ‘seek parental counsel when pursuing a romantic relationship.’ But the match has been a good one. Scanlan returned to campus in late August to begin her sophomore year. Among the things she loves about her classmates and her campus is her relative anonymity. ‘I've never had to sign an autograph, and I've never had to take a picture. Here, I can be just another student,’ she said. Blending in is not always easy for Scanlan, who won the Miss America Contest at 17, representing Nebraska. The youngest Miss America in more than 70 years, she spent a year fulfilling her duties and enrolled at Patrick Henry in 2012. She says the school's workload matched the grueling schedule as Miss America. The school was established in 2000 with the goal of giving home-schooled Christian conservatives a foundation to help them effect change in government, the law and journalism. The school started with 90 students and a single major - government. It is still a tiny campus in the outer suburbs of Washington, D.C., but now has 320 students and five majors, including journalism, literature and history. The SAT scores of its students are comparable to top-tier state universities. Then and now: Teresa Scanlan, pictured left during the swimsuit portion of the Miss America pageant in 2011, and now as a sophomore (right) at Patrick Henry College, which boasts a strict dress code . Wholesome image: Home-schooled Christian conservatives attending Patrick Henry College are expected to dress modestly and 'seek parental guidance before entering into romantic relationships' Dream come true: Scanlan said she had wanted to attend Patrick Henry since she was 8 years old . Scanlan, who came from a homeschooling family, says she wanted to go to Patrick Henry ever since she was 8. She . said she's frustrated by stereotypes that some hold about Patrick Henry . students. She recalled a recent photo essay published about the school . that she felt went out of its way to depict students as cloistered . weirdos. The reality, she said, is that while the students are Christian, they come from a variety of backgrounds. ‘There's . this idea that we don't struggle with the same problems, that we don't . understand real world problems ... that everyone comes from wonderful, . happy families, that we're close-minded and brainwashed. That kind of . pushes my buttons,’ she said. The degree to which some people are willing to make snap judgments about her has occasionally taken her aback. As . a teenager, she admits her schedule as Miss America and some of the . accompanying expectations, wore on her. The negativity she faced from . anonymous Internet critics was hurtful. Beauty queen: When then-17-year-old Scanlan won the Miss America crown in 2011, she became the youngest woman to do so . Backlash: Teresa has been criticized for taking part in the Miss America competition and parading on stage in a bikini, but the college student insists that she has never compromised her morals . ‘To have someone look at a picture of you and decide just based on that picture that they hate you, and that they're going to tell the world that they hate you - that takes some getting used to,’ she said. During her year as Miss America, Scanlan began to feel depressed and, at times, even suicidal. The depression continued during her freshman year, she said, when she found her coursework overwhelming. She earned a 3.75 grade-point average, but was disappointed because she had set a goal of a 3.9 or higher, which she feels she needs to get accepted into Harvard Law School. Scanlan reached out to her parents for help during her spring semester, and she's now taking fewer classes and worrying less about others' expectations. ‘I'm finally starting to let go of some of the stress, some of the responsibility,’ she said. While she loves her school, she said she has occasionally received criticism from some there who feel the Miss America pageant, particularly the swimsuit competition, is not compatible with a Christian lifestyle because it shows too much skin or objectifies women. Scanlan respectfully disagrees. Haters: Scanlan, pictured during the 2011 Miss America pageant playing the piano, said she was upset to see people who did not know her personally criticizing her online . ‘I have never violated my conscience. I was never compromising my morals,’ Scanlan insisted. ‘For myself, I have never believed it's wrong for a female to wear a swimsuit that would show the same amount of skin a man. It's a bit of a double standard.’ The school's founder and chancellor, Mike Farris, also said he received sporadic complaints that Scanlan's status as a Miss America was supposedly contrary to the school's code and values. ‘I don't view getting into the pageant world to be incompatible with Christian values,’ said Farris - who made his name as a lawyer defending homeschooler families. Farris never had any doubts that Scanlan would be a good ambassador for the school. Farris sensed she could be a starter on Patrick Henry's Moot Court team, which Farris coaches and regularly wins national championships. ‘She's very bright, a great communicator,’ Farris said, noting she placed third in a regional in Moot Court championships as a freshman. ‘Yeah, no doubt I expect a national championship out of her.’ Kira Clark, a Moot Court teammate of Scanlan's and now a roommate, described Scanlan as ‘a caring, incredibly ambitious, smart, compassionate person who puts her friends first.’ Personal struggles: Scanlan, seen in her moment of triumph in 2011, had to overcome depression caused by stress due to grueling coursework . On the small campus, she said students don't dwell on the fact that Scanlan was Miss America.‘We see her as a sister we can be proud of, rather than a celebrity we can be taking advantage of,’ Clark said. Despite her plans to reduce stress, Scanlan remains ambitious. On her LinkedIn profile, she lists herself, among other things, as ‘2028 presidential candidate.’ She would be 35, the constitutional minimum to serve as president. Farris, who designed the school with the idea of launching Christian conservatives into the public sphere, said Scanlan and many other Patrick Henry students set such goals and he encourages them to aim high. ‘If they mess up and only get to be governors and senators, I'll live with it,’ Farris said.","Teresa Scanlan won Miss America in 2011, at age 17 becoming the youngest woman to do so .

A couple were arrested at gunpoint by 18 police officers and held for four hours after a paramedic mistook their TV remote control for a gun. Michelle Malone, 46, and Keith Abrahams, 44, were in bed when 18 officers stormed their flat and bundled them out into a police van. The couple’s nightmare began when a paramedic was sent to their home  after Miss Malone suffered a panic attack. As he entered the bedroom to treat  Miss Malone, he spotted the remote control in Mr Abrahams’ hand. Apparently mistaking it for a gun, he immediately called police. Michelle Malone, 46, with Keith Abrahams were arrested by armed police who stormed her home after the TV remote control was mistaken for a gun . Eighteen officers – ten of whom were . armed and wearing body armour – then burst into the flat at 1am and the . couple were arrested at gunpoint. Mr Abrahams, a forklift truck driver, said: ‘I was shocked. Having guns pointed within an inch of my eyes is not the most fun. ‘I had been sitting in bed and I’d . dozed off watching something on telly. The next thing I know I’m being . ordered out of bed at gunpoint. It was absolutely terrifying. With Miss Malone’s condition . worsening the pair were taken to a nearby police station while officers . conducted a forensic fingertip search of their flat. Keith Abrahams says he was questioned for four hours about the 'firearm' before being released without charge . Detectives confirmed during the . pair’s interview that the paramedic believed he had spotted Mr Abrahams . holding a firearm. Miss Malone said: ‘The police told us the medic had . seen a 10in long black firearm being held by Keith as he lay in bed. ‘I suffered the indignity of being treated like this all for the sake of a television remote control. ‘I can only imagine what my neighbours thought. It was like something out of a film.’ The couple said they were surrounded . by ten armed officers wearing body armour, eight uniformed police as . well as a dog handler during the raid at 1am on June 24 in Hereford. Miss Malone added: ‘I just remember . running out of bed after hearing a bang like an earthquake and seeing . police pointing guns at Keith, who was up against the wall. We were held . at the station for four hours but released without charge. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I heard . they were searching for a gun. I’ve never had a gun in my life – I’ve . never even seen one before. It was just horrendous.’ Miss Malone, a former prison custody . officer, is now taking legal action against West Mercia Police after . suffering concussion during the incident. She said: ‘We received no apology and . I just feel violated by their intrusive actions. The way I was treated . in my own home was very traumatic. I already suffer from anxiety and . then to suffer the indignity of being arrested for absolutely nothing . has just alleviated this. ‘I suffered bruising and concussion . because of how forceful they were, and to treat a woman in her . bedclothes with such a degrading manner was embarrassing and upsetting.’ She added: ‘They also left my house looking like a bomb-site – it was like I had been burgled.’ Michelle is now taking legal action against West Mercia Police and has complained to the IPCC after she suffered concussion, which she says was a result of police's heavy-handed tactics . When the pair were eventually . released from Hereford Police Station, Mr Abrahams suffered a further . indignity when he was left to walk home in just his vest and boxer . shorts. He said: ‘It was pretty humiliating. They took Michelle home but . I had to walk back wearing a vest and boxer shorts.’ The couple are also demanding an . apology from West Midlands Ambulance Service which has since launched an . internal investigation into the paramedic who called police.

Pictures emerged in June showing Mr Saatchi apparently grabbing her throat during a heated exchange at a Mayfair restaurant. Since then, the 70-year-old millionaire art collector has accused his wife of ‘illegal acts’, while his daughter Phoebe, 18, said she had felt ‘abandoned’ by her stepmother. Lord Saatchi, the 67-year-old founder of advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi, was on The Andrew Marr Show yesterday to discuss his new book Brutal Simplicity of Thought when the host decided to quiz him on his brother’s marriage. Marr said: ‘I can’t end without asking you about your brother, Charles, who has been through a very torrid time of it, and ask how he is and how you feel he has been treated by the media and public opinion?’ Lord Saatchi appeared to suggest that ‘persecution mania’ had played a role. He said: ‘There are many aspects of human life, let’s consider them – persecution mania, love, sex, marriage, work. 'These are all areas which produce great difficulties in people, and family and marriage is certainly one of the most complex areas.’ Interview: Lord Saatchi was on The Andrew Marr Show to discuss his new book 'Brutal Simplicity of Thought' when the host asked him about his brother Charles . Referring to his late wife, Josephine . Hart, he added: ‘As Iris Murdoch said to Josephine Hart on many . occasions, marriage is a private place. What Iris Murdoch was saying or . suggesting was that it’s impossible for anybody, even the best friends . or relatives of the people involved cannot know what really happens . between a man and a woman. ‘When . somebody installs CCTV in people’s bedrooms, which may be the next step . of our surveillance state, then we’ll have the answer, but until then . we don’t know.’ Celebrity chef Miss Lawson, 53,  applied to divorce Mr Saatchi  on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour.

Silvana and her father had been sitting, on Sunday night, at the front of the coach, the part that hit the ground first. But in a horrific case of mistaken identity, their emotional grandfather, dazed by grief as he arrived at the makeshift morgue, mistook the body of Silvana for that of her younger sister, Italian media reported. Simona’s name therefore wrongly appeared on some early lists of the dead. Horrific: The crash happened on July 28.

Death: Daniel Cripps, 22, had downed 14 shots of vodka in a drinking game in Newport, South Wales . Two paramedics were today suspended for not to take a dying man to hospital after failing to fully assess his condition at a drunken house party. Welsh Ambulance Service employees Ian Powell and Lindsey Brown were called to the alcohol-fuelled party in Newport, South Wales, by the concerned friends of 22-year-old Daniel Cripps. The aspiring male model had downed 14 shots of vodka in a drinking game with his companions. A disciplinary hearing was told Mr Powell and Miss Brown failed to fully assess his condition. Mr Cripps, who had drunk ‘a large amount of alcohol’, suffered a heart attack 24 minutes later. Another ambulance came to take him to hospital but he failed to regain consciousness and died. Chairwoman Linda Summers said at the Health and Care Professions Council hearing that Mr Powell and Miss Brown had allowed the party to ‘override’ their clinical judgement. She said: ‘Neither paramedic has been able to offer a satisfactory explanation why the house and the people provided a safer environment for Patient A (Mr Cripps) than the hospital. ‘What underpins this case was the failure to assess all the relevant information at the scene and allowing irrelevant factors to over-ride clinical judgement.’ Mr Powell and Miss Brown were suspended from the register for 12 months for failing to take Mr Cripps to hospital. The party was just a five-minute drive away from Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital. Close: The party was just a five-minute drive away from Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales .

The taxpayer is being saved millions of pounds by a group of internet geeks in jeans, a long way from the buttoned-up formality of mandarins in Whitehall. Jordan Hatch is the youngest, having walked away from a degree or even A levels to join the Government’s Digital Service aged just 17. Tasked with dragging the civil service into the 21st century, he aims to make government relevant to a generation more used to smartphones than form-filling. Web genius: Jordan Hatch was just 17 when he swapped the classroom for life as a civil servant but he is responsible for some of the most popular features on gov.uk . The team is based in Holborn, halfway between Whitehall and the trendy ‘Silicon Roundabout’ of internet start-ups in East London. Jordan is the youngest member of a team of 250 which by 2015 is expected to have saved the taxpayer £1.2 billion. Most of the savings come from mothballing scores of websites for ministries and quangos, to create a single site – www.gov.uk – which becomes a one-stop site for anyone wanting to find out what the government is doing, or access forms, data or advice. The site has faced criticism for its over-simplified look, but this year beat the Shard and the Olympic cauldron to win Design of the Year. The chance to work on the mega-site, from its early beta stages, proved too much for Jordan. His parents bought their first computer when he was only six and at secondary school he designed websites and taught lessons in IT for other students. He later quit college after completing AS levels in politics, economics and business studies after his freelance computing work took over. He said: ‘It got to the point where I thought: I've got to make a call. ‘Do I want to focus on my studies or do I want to leave college and do other things?,’ he told The Times. As a 17-year-old in a government workplace he was too young to officially go to office parties. ‘It was orange Juice and don't tell anybody I'm here,’ he added. Swapping the classroom for the ultra-informal offices of GDS meant he could quickly put his theory into practice. Now 19, he still lives at home with his parents in North London. But he is responsible for some of the most popular sections of the site, including an updating calendar on when the next bank holiday is and when the clocks change. He has also designed a tool for paying council tax online. Stripped back: The single government website beat the Shard and the Olympics Cauldron to win Design of the Year in April . He could easily get snapped up by internet giants like Apple or Google. But Jordan insists that part of the appeal is making life easier for the Great British public. He said: ‘It's very nice to work for your country in a sense. The Civil Service is the ultimate British institution and it's great to be a part of that."" ‘Working for the public sector is great. You can actually making user's lives easier. That's what keeps me coming back to work.’ Cabinet office minister Francis Maude has already met Jordan, and believes the use of the internet can transform the way the government works – and spends money. Launching GDS’s new offices, Mr Maude said: ‘We are determined to offer world class digital products that meet people’s needs and offer better value for taxpayers’ money – and that is why we have set up the Government Digital Service. ‘The GDS will be the centre for digital government in the UK. ‘It will transform the way people access government information by using digital technology to deliver services that put the user first and give them the smartest and most cost-effective service possible.’","Jordan Hatch is part of a team dragging government into the 21st century .

Locked up: Marcus Simpson has been jailed for 16 years for smuggling submachine guns and other weapons from Serbia to London. He once stood as as a Tory councillor . A Tory candidate has been jailed for 16 years for selling submachine guns he smuggled from Serbia to drugs gangs in Britain. Marcus Simpson, who narrowly missed out on being elected to his local council, offered gangsters a ‘menu’ of weapons that included a Scorpion submachine gun, a laser-sighted assault rifle and Walther PPKs, plus silencers and ammunition. Simpson, 42, was a Conservative candidate for Corby, Northamptonshire, in the 2011 local elections. He lost by just 170 votes to Liberal Democrat Bob Riley. Sentencing him at Wood Green Crown Court, North London, yesterday, Judge Witold Pawlak said: ‘It’s not an exaggeration to describe you as a purveyor of death and fear. 'You presented yourself as a model member of the community who even stood to be a councillor. Behind this façade you were making at least two trips to Serbia to buy guns and ammunition.’ Prosecutor Quinn Hawkins said the guns were sold to gangs who used them ‘during a frenzied series of acts of violence’ in disputes over the sale of drugs. He described Simpson as the ‘head of the conspiracy’ who ‘had a  fascination with guns’. Police arrested Simpson and Ryan Groves, 39, moments after an arms deal at a restaurant in Tottenham, on May 29 last year. Jerome Minott was convicted alongside them for helping to peddle the weapons . Simpson and Groves, of Tottenham, admitted conspiracy to possession of firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life. Sentencing gun peddles Groves and . Minott to 12 years in prison each, Judge Pawlak said Groves was an . 'enthusiastic middle man' whilst Minott was 'less involved'. Brutal: Simpson's gang provided lethal weapons to clients, including a submachine gun, a laser sighted assault rifle and semi-automatic weapons. This is one of the gang's guns . Dangerous: Simpson was the ringleader of a three-strong gang who provided a 'menu' of lethal weapons to clients. This image shows some of the cash which was found on the gang . Calling . Simpson the 'head of the conspiracy', Mr Hawkins had previously told . the court how he even stood as a Conservative councillor for his home . borough of Corby. Mr Hawkins said: 'Marcus Simpson was the head of the conspiracy. 'He . had a fascination with guns. He presented himself as a model member of . the community, standing as a Conservative councillor for his home . borough in 2011. 'He was . the armourer. He was responsible for the purchases in Serbia and the . manufacturing of guns and ammunition at his home address in the garage. 'Groves and Minott acted as salesmen, selling guns and ammunition to gang members and drug dealers. 'They sold these items in the full knowledge that they could be used to endanger lives.' Police arrested Simpson and Groves . after a gun deal that took place inside Groves’ South Tottenham . restaurant Jah Mek Ya on May 29 last year, which was also attended by . Minott and two other men, one believed to be the buyer. In one text sent to Groves three days before the meeting at the restaurant Simpson advertised his stock. He . listed a Scorpion sub machine gun full auto select fire with two clips . for £3,700, two Walther PPKs for £2,600 each, three Bernerdeli/Beretta . mod 90 with silencer for £3,200 each and two Vzor mod 50 with silencers . for £3,300 each and one without a silencer for £2,950. Convicted: Simpson peddled the haul through sellers Ryan Groves, left, and Jerome Minott, right . Evidence: Police recovered boxes of ammunition, left, as well as latex gloves, right, from the gang . Of the PPKs, Mr Hawkins said: 'Any James Bonds fans amongst you would have heard of this gun.'

'Gang lifestyles can often be chaotic and lead to serious violence and . this case goes some way in demonstrating the complex nature of Trident's . investigations. 'The criminal activity of those convicted has caused misery to local . residents and the local area, creating a hostile place to live due to . their violence, criminality and anti-social behaviour. 'There have been no shootings on the Chingford Hall Estate since the last three shootings that took place in April 2012.

But the LADEE spacecraft quickly ran into equipment trouble, and while NASA assured everyone early Saturday that the lunar probe was safe and on a perfect track for the moon, officials acknowledged the problem needs to be resolved in the next two to three weeks. S. Peter Worden, director of NASA's Ames Research Center in California, which developed the spacecraft, told reporters he's confident everything will be working properly in the next few days. LADEE's reaction wheels were turned on to orient and stabilize the spacecraft, which was spinning too fast after it separated from the final rocket stage, Worden said.

The first ever U.S live stream of an operation using Google Glass has been made by a surgeon in Ohio. The surgeon used Google Glass to consult with a distant colleague using live, point-of-view video from the operating room. The live stream was part of the exclusive Google Glass Explorer Program, which invited only 1,000 people in the U.S to test the device. Scroll down for video... A surgeon at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center is the first in the United States to consult with a distant colleague using live, point-of-view video from the operating room via Google Glass . Source: Google . Google Glass comes in the form of . eyeglasses that can record videos, take photos, chat, get directions, . look up facts on the Web. ‘It’s a privilege to be a part of this project as we explore how this exciting new technology might be incorporated into the everyday care of our patients,’ said Dr. Christopher Kaeding, the physician who performed the surgery and director of sports medicine at Ohio State. ‘To be honest, once we got into the surgery, I often forgot the device was there. It just seemed very intuitive and fit seamlessly.’ Google Glass has a frame similar to traditional glasses, but instead of lenses, there is a small glass block that sits above the right eye. On that glass is a computer screen that, with a simple voice command, allows users to pull up information as they would on any other computer. Attached to the front of the device is a . camera that offers a point-of-view image and the ability to take both . photos and videos while the device is worn. VIDEO: A recording of the surgery  that was transmitted live via Google Glass . Ohio State University College of Medicine students watched the surgery transmitted live. Across town, one of Dr Kaeding'S Ohio State colleagues, Dr Robert Magnussen, watched the surgery his office . During this procedure at the medical center’s University East facility, Dr Kaeding wore the device as he performed surgery on Paula Kobalka, 47, from Westerville, Ohio, who hurt her knee playing softball. As he performed her operation at a facility on the east side of Columbus, Google Glass showed his vantage point via the internet to audiences miles away. One of Kaeding’s Ohio State colleagues, Dr. Robert Magnussen, watched the surgery his office in another part of town, while on the main campus, several students at The Ohio State University College of Medicine watched on their laptops. ‘To have the opportunity to be a medical student and share in this technology is really exciting,’ said Ryan Blackwell, a second-year medical student who watched the surgery remotely. How Glass works: A German designer created this infographic to show how the eyewear projects an image . 1,000 people in the U.S. have been chosen to test Google Glass as part of Google's Explorer Program . ‘This could have huge implications, not . only from the medical education perspective, but because a doctor can . use this technology remotely, it could spread patient care all over the . world in places that we don’t have it already.’ In the future, doctors could use voice commands to instantly call up X-ray or MRI images of their patient, pathology reports or reference materials. They could collaborate live and face-to-face with colleagues via the internet, anywhere in the world. ‘It puts you right there, real time,’ said Dr Clay Marsh, who is the executive director of the Center for Personalised Health Care at Ohio State. ‘Not only might you be able to call up any kind of information you need or to get the help you need, but it’s the ability to do it immediately that’s so exciting,’ he said. ‘Now, we just have to start using it. Like many technologies, it needs to be evaluated in different situations to find out where the greatest value is and how it can impact the lives of our patients in a positive way.’ Google started shipping the Explorer Edition prototypes in April and the device is expected to . arrive on the market for the general public later this year. Around 10,000 people throughout the world are trying out an early version of Google Glass with most of them selected as part of a contest. To get a sense of the advantages and drawbacks of the device, The Associated Press spoke to three Glass owners who have been using the device since late spring. The trio's favorite feature, by far, is the hands-free camera that shoots photos and video through voice commands. Images can also be captured by pressing a small button along the top of the right frame of Glass. They also liked being able to connect to the Internet simply by tapping on the right frame of Glass to turn it on and then swiping along the same side to scroll through a menu. That menu allows them to do such things as get directions on Google's map or find a piece of information through Google's search engine. The information is shown on a thumbnail-sized transparent screen attached just above the right eye to stay out of a user's field of vision. Among the biggest shortcomings they cited was Glass' short battery life, especially if a lot of video is being taken. Although Google says Glass should last for an entire day on a single battery charge for the typical user, users claimed there were times when theyran out of power after 90 minutes to two hours during periods when  recording a lot of video.","This is the first ever U.S. live stream of an operation via Google Glass .

It is not just for myself but for those brave men we lost.’ Wireless operator Dennis Moss, 89, pictured with other medals he has won, has been told he's not eligible for a Bomber Command Clasp as he was based in Italy . Mr Moss was a wireless operator in RAF Wellington and Liberator bombers between April 1944 and the end of the war, attacking German lines in Italy and heavily-defended airfields in Romania and Greece. He also helped to supply partisans in Yugoslavia. He was among hundreds of RAF crew   based in Italy with the Central Mediterranean Forces. A great-grandfather, Mr Moss said: ‘We were fighting the same war and were over enemy territory up against the same opposition and fighter planes. When people flew off on missions you never knew if you would see them again – and every time you went out you were aware that you might not come back. Pictured as an 18-year-old, Mr Moss flew 40 missions on Wellington bombers in World War Two . ‘There was a memorial to Bomber Command inaugurated by the Queen in London last year. Does this ruling by the Ministry of Defence mean the memorial doesn’t recognise the people who, like me, flew out from bases outside Britain? There doesn’t seem to be any logic to their thinking.’ Mr Moss, from Abergavenny, South Wales, served with 40 Squadron, 178 Squadron and 37 Squadron. He applied earlier this year for the new Bomber Command Clasp but was turned down and lost an appeal to try to get the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency to reverse the decision. His MP David Davies has now taken up his case. He said: ‘This is stupid bureaucracy. All those who served as aircrew should be remembered in the same way. ‘If it wasn’t for the courage of men like Mr Moss then we would probably still be living under a dictatorship. ‘Either the eligibility criteria for the Bomber Command Clasp should be extended to those who flew under  the command of Central Mediterranean Forces or they should have their own clasp.’ A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said it was awaiting the conclusions of an independent medal review, ‘so we would be unable to comment on this issue further’.

Those who believe they are eligible for the award, details of which were announced in February this year, or their next of kin, can apply to the Ministry of Defence for the Bomber Command Clasp. Last month a World War Two veteran who flew over Nazi Germany was told he was ineligible for the Clasp because his service was eight days too short. John Joyner, 89, of Cromer, Norfolk, was a gunner with Bomber Command from March 18 1945 until the Germans surrendered on May 8 of that year. He had served for 52 days - short of the 60 required by the Bomber Command Clasp eligibility criteria - and so his application and subsequent appeal were turned down by the Service and Personnel Veterans Agency. Mr Joyner, who holds the War Medal 1935-1945 and France Germany Star, said: 'It's a nonsense and it's nit-picking .","Dennis Moss, 89, from Abergavenny, was based in Italy during the war .

Hundreds of the highest earners at HSBC could be in line for a bumper pay rise as the lender tries to swerve a new bonus cap from Brussels. The chairman of HSBC admitted yesterday that it was considering plans to hike salaries for employees to ensure they do not leave for better paid jobs with  US or Asian rivals.

Douglas Flint, who received a £2.4 million package last year, said the lender would 'comply with the law' but needs to 'remain competitive' The comments sparked a furious reaction from campaigners and came as HSBC announced a 10pc rise in profits to £9.2b billion in the first half of the year. Deborah Hargreaves, chair of the High Pay Commission, called on shareholders to ‘step in to address this blatant flouting of the spirit of the law’ and warned that other banks would ‘follow suit.’ She said: ‘Big bonuses in banking are something that the public has failed to understand the need for. Stupid statements like this only serve to undermine the public confidence that banks are capable of changing.’ HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, paid 204 of its staff more than £1 million last year . HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, paid 204 of its staff more than £1 million last year, including £4.4 million in pay and perks for chief executive Stuart Gulliver. But the release of share bonuses awarded to him in previous years took his total package to just under  £9 million. Mr Gulliver could be one of those  affected by the cap as his annual bonus of £2 million was worth more than his £1.25 million salary. Staff at the investment bank received an average bonus of more than £50,000. In January banks heaquartered in EU will face strict limits on the bonuses they can pay staff across the world. They will not be allowed to pay a bonus worth more than a year’s salary, unless they receive the approval of shareholders. The absolute maximum will be twice annual salary. The rules were introduced in the wake of the financial crisis. But they have been fiercely opposed by the Bank of England and the Government, which has tried in vain to block the plans. Banks with large offices outside Europe but which have their headquarters in the EU have complained bitterly that staff working in Asia and the US will be poached by local rivals  which do not have such restrictions on pay. Mr Flint admitted it was considering hiking basic pay to prevent this from happening. ‘We will comply with the law but we believe we will be able to make ourselves competitive’. Asked whether the bank would raise salary, Mr Flint said: ‘It’s certainly one of the possibilities. We are looking at a whole range if things to see what we can do.  The important thing is we remain competitive.’ The comments confirm the worst fears of the Treasury and the Bank of England  which have warned that the introduction of a bonus cap would simply cause banks to raise the basic salaries of staff.

His films taught us that - provided you can put up with a car chase, a swim in an eel-infested pond or a mad dash along London's Southbank - love, actually, will always find a way. But Richard Curtis has revealed that he felt compelled to write his happily-ever-after romantic comedies because of a personal heartbreak - and named the woman at who caused it. The director, whose works include Love Actually, Notting Hill and Four Weddings And A Funeral, said his student girlfriend Carolyn Colquhoun 'broke my heart spectacularly, as a result of which I wrote about unbroken hearts for ten years'. Scroll down for video . Muse: Richard Curtis, left, with Carolyn Colquhoun . Miss Colquhoun - now Mrs Carolyn Morton-Hooper and married to solicitor Anthony Morton-Hooper who represented Lord Archer during his 2001 trial for perjury - met Curtis at Oxford University where they both studied in the 1970s. Curtis - who is now promoting his latest film About Time - was reading English Language and Literature and Miss Colquhoun was studying history. She also dated Rowan Atkinson, who has since appeared in several of Curtis's films - although it is believed this was before her 12-month relationship with Curtis. Curtis, who now lives in Notting Hill with his partner, the broadcaster Emma Freud, told Time Out magazine that Miss Colquhoun was the fourth girl he fell in love with. 'I owe her my movie career,' he said. Now 56, also admitted to having his first crush when he was eight years old - perhaps inspiring the younger love birds in his films such as Sam in Love Actually (played by Thomas Sangster), who falls deeply in love with an American girl at his school. Young love: Curtis said he remembers first falling in love at the age of eight - like Sam (Thomas Sangster) in Love Actually, pictured here with Liam Neeson, who plays his stepfather . This was the first time that Curtis has named his muse, although he previously mentioned a student heartbreak. 'I fell in love, and that dominated my second year; and then I got heartbroken and that dominated the next year,' he said. Curtis, who is now promoting his latest film About Time, said he had also been besotted with actresses Julie Andrews and Sylvia Kristel. Partner: Richard Curtis now lives with Emma Freud, with whom he has four children . The now father-of-four - Scarlett, 18, Jake, 16, Charlie, 11, and Spike, nine - said that losing 'the girl who you couldn't get to love you quite enough' had inspired him to write films that made 'love affairs turn out right, to try to make up for what happened'. Mrs Morton-Hooper - who has four children aged between 21 and 26 - yesterday refused to disclose why she had broken up with the budding director, adding: 'I could tell you lots of anecdotes but I won't'. The 59-year-old admitted that she had not spoken to Curtis for years and had no idea that the break-up had affected him so deeply, saying: 'I'd quite like a word with him now.' She told the Daily Telegraph: 'I think I was Richard's first girlfriend and you always remember your first love because it's very special. 'But I don't know about breaking his heart. We were young, just students at the time. 'Richard was always a star, even at university. His career was always going to be successful. I don't think I can take any credit for kick starting it. Now a history teacher, Mrs Morton-Hooper enjoyed a brief acting career, appearing in several television shows between 1983 and 1992 including an . episode of Blackadder. She also played roles in Agatha Christie’s . Poirot, The Bill, and TV adaptations . of Anthony Price’s Cold War Killers and The Alamut Ambush. Her husband is a partner at legal firm Mishcon de Reya. Her son William, 23, said: 'My mum, Rowan and Richard were at university together, but Rowan had nothing to do with their break-up. In fact I think she dated Rowan before Richard.' Mrs Morton-Hooper's youngest son Freddie appeared in Handmade Tales, a play for children, this summer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe - where Curtis and Atkinson had their break in 1979. Penning a review of the show online, Mrs Morton-Hooper wrote: 'I am totally biased, having a son in the show, but it was fantastic. 'Full of energy, each member of the cast was ideally suited to their roles and although child-friendly, the play was thought-provoking for any age.'

"By . James Chapman and Kirsty Walker . UPDATED: . 05:06 EST, 19 January 2012 . Reviled: MPs have demanded Fred Goodwin, whose bank had to be saved with billions of taxpayers' money, be stripped of his knighthood after a highly critical report of the FSA . Disgraced banker Sir Fred Goodwin faced growing calls last night to be stripped of his knighthood. David Cameron is ‘sympathetic’ to cross-party demands for the most reviled figure of the financial crisis to lose the honour bestowed on him for ‘services to banking’. Sir Fred steered the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse. His bank had to be kept afloat with £45billion of taxpayers’ money and is still 83 per cent owned by the state. Following a highly critical report by the Financial Services Authority, MPs say Sir Fred’s case should now be referred to a secretive Whitehall body responsible for investigating whether honours should be revoked. Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood is the most senior member of the Forfeiture Committee, which is responsible for ensuring the honours system does not fall into disrepute and can ask the Queen to remove official awards. Since 1995, it has recommended that 34 people are stripped of their honours, including Zimbawean tyrant Robert Mugabe, former world boxing champion Prince Nazeem Hamed, who was convicted of dangerous driving, and Jean Else, a Manchester headmistress accused of nepotism and mismanagement. Miss Esle was made a dame for services to education had her honour revoked in February 2011 – two years after being found guilty of misconduct by the General Teaching Council. She was dismissed following claims of ‘nepotism’ and was found guilty of failing to observe minimum standards in recruiting and promoting staff at Manchester’s Whalley Range High School. The committee normally considers cases put to it when a holder of an honour has been found guilty of a criminal offence or when they have been censured by a regulator or professional body relevant to the granting of the award. Other examples of recent forfeitures include a company boss who forfeited his CBE after being disqualified from serving as a director following a Government investigation, a doctor who lost his OBE implicated in a series of deaths at a leading hospital and a man who lose his MBE following a forgery charge. Most famously, champion jockey Lester Piggott was stripped of his OBE after serving 12 months for a £2.8 million tax fraud in 1987. The committee is thought to have discussed Sir Fred’s knighthood in 2009, but no action was taken. MPs say that following the FSA’s report into the RBS, there is now an overwhelming argument that he has been criticised by the relevant regulatory authority and should lose it. Disgraced: Tyrannical Robert Mugabe and Dame Jean Else, the 'super-head' schoolteacher who was guilty of misconduct, were stripped of their . official awards following a recommendation by the panel . Stripped: Boxer Prince Naseem Hamed had his MBE revoked for his driving conviction . The FSA said the former RBS chief . executive had aggressively expanded the institution over his eight-year . tenure – culminating in the disastrous acquisition of ABN Amro in 2007. It found RBS had been brought to its knees by ‘multiple poor decisions’ and its £50billion ‘gamble’ on buying the Dutch bank. Despite . his key role in the downfall of RBS, Paisley-born Sir Fred continues to . enjoy a gold-plated lifestyle, funded by a £342,500-a-year pension. The banker also took out a £2.8million tax-free lump sum from his pension before he started receiving it. He has not been prosecuted or penalised in any way, despite steering the bank to the brink of collapse. Tory MP Matthew Hancock, who sits on the Commons public accounts committee, and is a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, said: ‘No-one has ever presided over a bigger corporate disaster that has had implications for every single family in Britain than Fred Goodwin. ‘The knighthood given to him by Gordon Brown is inappropriate for someone who was reckless at the helm of one of Scotland’s oldest institutions.’ Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron . said: ‘It was completely inappropriate that he had it in the first . place. He is someone who has damaged the country by his actions. ‘If . it had been through incompetence, we could have lived with it. But it . was through utter recklessness which cost thousands of people their jobs . and left us to pick up the bill.’ Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry said: ‘I think honours are supposed to be for people who deserve them, and he doesn’t.’ Barrage of criticism: Fred Goodwin faced angry protesters and furious shareholders at a meeting in 2008 over the way he and his management team had got the bank into such a weak financial position . Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: . ‘Honours should be reserved for those who serve not stuff the public, so . this is a case the committee should look long and hard at.’ Liberal . Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott, who is close to Business Secretary Vince . Cable, said: ‘In the light of the FSA report, it is completely untenable . that he should be allowed to keep his knighthood. ‘We . all know the cost of his services to banking. If ever there was a case . for someone to be stripped of his knighthood, it is Sir Fred Goodwin who . ran RBS into the ground and cost every taxpayer in this country £40 . billion and counting.’ All ears: British Prime Minister David Cameron says he is 'sympathetic' for demands that the banker have his knighthood stripped of him . Jim . Sheridan, the Labour MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire North, said Sir . Fred should be stripped of his knighthood for ‘causing so much misery . and damage to industry’. “I don’t know how anyone can refer to him as ‘sir’,” he said. “The government needs to demonstrate that people who behave in this way will not be given rewards of any kind.” Independent Lothian MSP Margo MacDonald added: “The honourable thing for him to do would be to hand it back. Shadow Cabinet minister Michael Dugher said: ‘It was wrong that Fred Goodwin was knighted. Most of my constituents in Barnsley think it is outrageous he can dine out on being a ‘sir’ and I am inclined to agree with them.’ Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘Sir Fred Goodwin is utterly discredited, like the party who gave him the honour. He ruined RBS and left the nation to foot the cost. It is right and justified that he should be stripped of his knighthood. The public will welcome this.’ Liberal Democrat MP Lorely Burt, who is chair of the Liberal Democrat backbench business committee, said: ‘A knighthood is an honour bestowed on individuals who are devoted to and give up their time for the public good. If Sir Fred Goodwin is  allowed to hold on to his, it would diminish the value of these honours for all those who truly deserve them.’ Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner said: . ‘Sir Fred Goodwin should be stripped of his knighthood - and not before . time. He is representative of bankers everywhere who have abused their . positions for their own ends. I am not a fan of the honours system. It . is time the whole thing was cleaned up.’ Labour MP Teresa Pearce, a member of . the Commons Treasury select committee, said: ‘It was an error to give . him a knighthood. If Fred Goodwin was given his honour for services to . banking, I’d love to see what a disservice looked like. This man . collapsed an entire bank and nearly the British economy.’ “He has been so lacking in honour. If he wants to try to make it up to the people he let down and the communities whose standards of probity and care towards each other he stamped on, then one of the things he could do is give the knighthood back. “A knighthood is supposed to honour probity and all-round generosity of spirit to the community. I don’t think we can say that about him.” Honour: The prestigious knighthood medal . The FSA report into the collapse of RBS, published late last year, concluded that the bank’s directors – led by Sir Fred and former chairman Sir Tom McKillop – relied for their due diligence during the disastrous takeover of ABN AMRO on two ring-binder folders and a CD. The report also detailed the strained relationship between the watchdog and Sir Fred before 2005, in particular over RBS’s reluctance to allow its non-executive directors to meet the FSA on an individual one-to-one basis. ‘FSA supervisory records from 2004 suggest that RBS management, and in particular the RBS chief executive, had been resistant to what they saw as unnecessary FSA interference,’ the watchdog said. The FSA said Sir Fred pushed ahead with the reckless ABN AMRO deal without ‘a sufficient understanding of the risks involved’. The report said: ‘The decision to make a bid of this scale on the basis of a limited due diligence entailed a degree of risk-taking that can reasonably be criticised as a gamble. ‘Many will find this conclusion [that no director will face sanctions] difficult to accept. Surely someone can and should be held responsible.’ It also said that ‘Sir Fred’s ‘robust and assertive’ management style had been flagged as a potential risk as early as 2003. The banker won his knighthood in 2004. FSA chairman Lord Turner has admitted taxpayers are ‘absolutely furious’ that Sir Fred could apparently not be punished. Asked if he thought it was fair the banker had got away scot-free he said: ‘No, no I don’t.’","David Cameron ‘sympathetic’ to calls for Goodwin to lose the honour for ‘services to banking’

Betting shops would be banned from opening in a town centres under Lib Dem plans to curb gambling. Communities minister Don Foster wants to change the law so that every new bookmakers requires planning permission to set up business. But he faces opposition from Tory colleagues in the coalition, who have moved to make it easier for betting shops to open. Blight: High-stakes casino-style gambling machines been blamed for the spread of betting shops in deprived areas . Mr Foster will use next month’s Lib Dem conference in Glasgow to set out plans for new laws to halt the spread of betting shops, which have taken over in many deprived areas. He will call for betting shops to be put in a new separate planning use class, allowing local councils to reject applications. Labour’s controversial Gambling Act would also be amended to allow councils to take into account the ‘cumulative impact of a proliferation of gambling activities’ when considering applications. Warning: Local government minister Don Foster wants to change the law to curb betting shops . In May new laws came into force allowing betting shops to open up in pubs without planning permission in what was dubbed a ‘free for all’ on Britain’s high streets. The rules have been introduced for a two-year period to try to make it easier for people to fill empty shops or start new businesses without having to seek permission to change property from one use to another. The Local Government Association has repeatedly called for more powers to curb the problem. Bookmakers have swamped the UK's shopping parades – with numbers up 25 per cent since 2008 - and in one London borough, Newham, there are currently 82 - six per square mile. Around almost every corner in this generally deprived part of East London are shops where people can stake £100 a spin on casino-style gambling machines, which are as addictive as crack cocaine . The liberalisation of gambling laws by the Labour government in 2005 is blamed for a surge in the number of betting shops. At present betting shops are in the same planning use class as banks and building societies. It means they can open without planning permission in many cases where banks have moved out. There are also growing concerns about big money gambling machines found in many betting shops, where users can stake £100 a spin on a casino-style jackpot payout. They account for more revenue than the traditional bets placed on sporting events. Concentrated: This graphic shows the main areas which have been saturated by betting shops in Newham, East London, which has 82 bookmakers . A government review by TV retail guru Mary Portas describes gaming outlets as a ‘blight on the high . Street’, and warned their proliferation is creating unsightly gambling ‘clusters’ on struggling shopping streets. Earlier this year Newham Council refused to allow a further betting shop in an already over-crowded street, but it was overturned on appeal. Mr Foster will argue that local councillors ‘should be empowered to decide whether or not to give approval to additional gambling venues in their community’.","Don Foster wants to stop betting shops opening without permission .

In June his website revealed: ‘Chuka has developed a Streatham Strategy to help the High Road. It includes a temporary cut in VAT [and] new powers to control the number of betting shops’. Gambling man: Neil Goulden, chairman emeritus of Gala Coral Group, gave the money to run the Labour frontbencher's office . Yet last month he registered the donation to ‘support the office of Chuka Umunna in his capacity as shadow secretary of state for business, and for staffing’. Earlier this year Mr Umunna was forced to deny doctoring his Wikipedia page to include flattering comparisons with Barack Obama. In April it emerged a change to the entry in 2008, which included a link to a flattering profile of him, had been made from a computer at the law firm where Mr Umunna worked before entering Parliament in 2010. Mr Umunna’s spokesman said the Labour frontbencher had ‘no recollection’ of changing his Wikipedia page, but offered no explanation of how it had come to be changed from his former place of work. The Daily Mail subsequently revealed that in 2006 Mr Umunna had protested that West End nightclubs ‘seem to be full of trash and C-list wannabes’. Tory party vice-chairman Bob Neill said yesterday: ‘Can anyone really credibly ever believe anything Chuka Umunna says? 'He says one thing in public and does another behind closed doors. His hypocrisy seems to be limitless. ‘The only thing we know he truly believes is that the capital is full of ‘‘trash’’ and ‘‘C-list’’ wannabes.’ A spokesman for Mr Umunna said: ‘This donation was made by an individual Labour Party supporter in a personal capacity, and was accepted in accordance with the rules and properly declared.’","Shadow business secretary received donation from Neil Goulden, from Gala Coral Group .

Sworn at: Brian Wales felt intimidated when he worked at Jamie Oliver's parents' pub . Jamie Oliver's parents are being sued by a former kitchen porter who claims he was underpaid and regularly sworn at while working at the family’s Essex pub. Former businessman Brian Wales, 71, claims the chef’s father Trevor was ‘abusive’ and ‘bullied’ him after he discovered that he and 56 other casual workers were owed money. The claims have surfaced two weeks after Jamie sparked  outrage by claiming British kitchen workers were lazy compared with ‘tougher’ immigrant staff. Mr Wales took up the part-time, £7-an-hour dishwashing job at The Cricketers in Clavering to subsidise his pension.  All was well until May, when he found he had been underpaid by about half an hour a day. ‘I felt cheated,’ he said. ‘A few pounds here and there might not seem much money to some, but when you are struggling to get by on a pension, every penny counts.’ Pub managers found that 57 staff employed on hourly rates had been underpaid, with the Olivers blaming a faulty machine used to check when staff clocked on and off. They have since paid out a total of £1,847 to staff, including £40 to Mr Wales. He said: ‘Sally Oliver thanked me for bringing the issue to her attention so they could rectify it.’ But shortly afterwards, Mr Wales claims he was told by a pastry chef that Trevor Oliver ‘now had it in for him’. Scroll down for video . Sued: Trevor Oliver behind the bar with his son Jamie . ‘One day I got into work and Trevor . told me to clean the ovens, which wasn’t my job,’ he says, ‘When I said . so, he told me, “Clean that f****** stove now as you have f*** all to . do”. I did it, but it was upsetting to be spoken to like that.’ Later that same day, he claims Trevor again swore at him, saying: ‘Why can’t you f****** get out of here by 3pm.’ Mr . Wales says he raised the issue of his ‘bullying’ in a letter to Sally, . and in June asked Trevor if he could speak with him about his concerns. He claims he was then told: ‘No, I don’t have the f****** time to talk to you. Either you get on with your work or f*** off.’ He adds: ‘Trevor did eventually calm down and offered an apology for his language but I was still concerned that I was on the wrong side of him .  .  . I did not believe Trevor was genuinely pleased that I raised the payroll issue.’ Family run: The Cricketers Pub in Clavering, Essex; owned by the parents of celebrity chef Jamie Oliver . Mr Wales said he even feared Trevor may become violent towards him, and had no other choice but to resign. He is now bringing his case to an industrial tribunal, a date for which has yet to be set. In response, the Olivers say it is ‘accepted that a degree of bad language is relatively commonplace within a kitchen’ but describe Mr Wales’s claims of abuse and bullying as ‘wholly bogus and without foundation... To suggest that there was a campaign directed at Mr Wales is completely refuted.’ In their statement to the tribunal they claim it was clear Mr Wales ‘regarded the work .  .  . as beneath him’. As a result, they say, Mr Wales ‘seemed prepared to go to great lengths to avoid doing his job’. And they claim workmates are ‘queuing up’ to give evidence ‘to expose just how  fabricated the claims are’.","Brian Wales, 71, worked part-time at The Cricketers in Clavering, Essex, to subsidise his pension .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 06:42 EST, 6 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:23 EST, 6 August 2013 . Britain's property market is beginning to boom again with prices rising faster than they have done for three years, it emerged today. And prices are expected to rise even further over the rest of the year, mortgage lender Halifax said today. The encouraging signs of increasing market activity came in a report from the building society showing a 4.6 per cent annual rise in sold prices in July this year, the strongest uplift seen since August 2010. Recovery: Prices have risen faster than they have done for three years, mortgage lender the Halifax said today . Halifax's house price graph index graph shows how prices are rising by above four per cent over last summer (Quarterly annual % change along the top; quarterly year on year price change on the left) Thanks to consumer confidence, prices lifted by 0.9 per cent month on month to reach £169,624 on average, marking the sixth monthly rise in a row. Halifax housing economist Martin Ellis said recent signs of improvement in the economy and increases in employment have helped boost confidence, although activity is still being held back by the squeeze on household budgets. He said: 'House prices are expected to continue to rise gradually through this year, with only modest economic growth and still falling real earnings constraining housing demand and activity.' Halifax’s report follows similar findings from building society Nationwide last week that the housing market revival is gathering pace. Lenders, surveyors, estate agents and property websites have all been reporting a strong pick-up in activity following the launch of a Government scheme called Funding for Lending one year ago, which has prompted a big increase in mortgage availability and mortgage providers to slash their rates. Other initiatives called NewBuy and Help to Buy have been aimed at giving people with smaller deposits a leg up. Recent rise: House prices have risen for six months in a row but average house prices to earnings are also on the rise . House sales in the first half of 2013 were six per cent up on the same period last year, according to HM Revenue and Customs figures. However, Halifax’s figures also show the impact of the recent house price increases in terms of how far borrowers are having to stretch themselves. House prices now stand at 4.62 times average earnings following some steady increases in recent months. This is still way below a peak of 5.83 times earnings recorded six years ago, having lifted from a trough of 4.34 in 2009. 'House prices are expected to continue to rise gradually through this year' - Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist . Concerns have been raised that Help to Buy in particular, which will be fully launched next year and underwrite £130bn of low-deposit mortgage lending with state guarantees, must not lead to a property 'bubble'. A report from property website Rightmove yesterday found that 60 per cent of people currently living in the rental sector still feel 'trapped', meaning they would like to buy their own home but do not think they can afford to. Just under a third (31 per cent) of trapped renters said they had previously owned their own home but had returned to the rental sector in the tough economy. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: 'This will be a long, slow recovery. 'Much ground has been lost and transactions and lending levels are running at a fraction of what they were at the height of the housing boom. 'Government schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy are seeing a positive impact though, and we expect this to continue when the mortgage guarantee element of Help to Buy is introduced in January.'","Returning consumer confidence pushes prices up 4.6 per cent since 2012 .

A veterinary nurse from Surrey has been hailed a hero after she used a broom to fight off a pair of lions attacking a teenage girl in South Africa. Natalie Bennett, 24, was cleaning cages at a wildlife centre when the lions grabbed a fellow volunteer and dragged her into their pen. A male lion and a lioness caught an 18 year old girl by her legs and quick-thinking Natalie came to her rescue and fended off the predators. Hero: Natalie Bennett used a broom to fight off two lions who were attacking a teenager at a South African wildlife centre . King of the jungle: A stock picture of lions at the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre where Natalie bennet was working as a volunteer . Lauren Fagen, from Canada, suffered severe wounds to her legs and thighs. She'd been dragged into the cage by her legs and was bleeding heavily. Natalie, who works at the Stone Lion veterinary practice in Wimbledon, was on a three-month volunteer placement at the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, near the Drakensberg mountains in South Africa when she heard piercing screams. She said: ‘At first we thought it was a group messing about because of the lions. ‘A split second later we realised what it was and started running. ‘When we got there a couple of volunteers were in complete shock and were just stood there terrified.’ Miss Fagen, 18, from Montreal, had been dragged through the cage by her knees after kneeling by the cage and putting her hand out for the lions to ‘lick’. Animal lover: Miss Bennett, pictured during a three month placement in South Africa, is a vetinary nurse at a practice in Wimbledon . A male grabbed her knee through the bars and pulled her leg into the cage, closely followed by a lioness who grabbed her other leg leaving her powerless. Natalie, from Carshalton, Surrey, said: ‘We tried to distract the lions by thundering on the cages to try and scare them and we got brooms and brushes to try and get them off her.’ ‘It was the lioness we were worried about because they are the killers. ‘The male was hand reared by the student coordinator so all he had to say was no and he would back off, but because there was blood you can't really expect them to differentiate between meat you are providing to them and not.’ After two frantic minutes the lions released their grip on the 18-year-old who was bleeding heavily having sustained severe wounds to her legs and thighs. Back home: Natalie Bennett with parents Nigel and Debbie Bennett along with one with cat Kitty . As the first medically qualified volunteer on the scene, Natalie sprung into action using skills she learned in the veterinary practice applying pressure to the wound and preventing the girl from going into shock before a paramedic arrived on the scene. Natalie said: ‘Both her knees were injured and she had puncture wounds in the calf and huge gouges out of her thigh. ‘She was extremely luck the lions didn't just rip her legs off, and that they did not hit the ephemeral artery.’ Her mother, Debbie Bennett, praised her daughter's quick actions. She said: ‘Natalie is a qualified veterinary nurse so is quite capable of doing first aid and keeping calm so she would have been a very good person to have in that situation. ‘It would have been very difficult for her to see because she loves the wildlife and animals and to see one attack a volunteer must have been very difficult for her. ‘From what she's told me it seems as if she was a bit of a heroine to get in there and try and get this lion off that was attacking a volunteer - I think she did brilliantly.’ Miss Fagen is recovering in hospital but will be left with significant scarring.","Natalie Bennett, 24, from Surrey, saved teen from lions in South Africa .

And that is exactly what happened when the underage guitarist of an American band was refused entry to his own gig. The Michigan-based band Wayne Szalinski were due to play in a Chicago bar during a tour of the U.S Midwest, but were told that because of a strict over 21s door policy the lead singer and guitarist would not be allowed in. Scroll down for video . Instead of joining his band mates Andrew Adams, Ian Siporin and Nick Galli onstage, Andy Milad (pictured) instead hooked up to the sound system inside, and played on the streets outside . The Michigan based band Wayne Szalinski were due to play in a Chicago bar during a tour of the U.S mid west, but were told that because of a strict over 21s door policy the lead singer and guitarist would not be allowed in . Not to be deterred the band set up anyway - but instead of joining his band mates Andrew Adams, Kurtis Roy and Nick Galli onstage, 20-year-old Andy Milad instead hooked up to the sound system inside, and played on the streets outside. The bizarre situation was caught on film and quickly shared online. Since it was first aired, the video of the band playing their song has exploded online, garnering over half a million views since debuting over the weekend. The film has since earned the band a few more fans, particularly on their Facebook site, with the viral video shared across the world. Mr Milad said: 'We were informed by . the doorman that even though I was simply performing, not drinking, that . I could not enter the bar because I was underage. The bizarre situation was caught on film and quickly shared online - garnering the band more fans overseas . 'We were not informed of the bar's policy in advance of the show and didn't expect any trouble since we had never had any problems of the sort in our homestate of Michigan. 'We asked the doorman if we could load in anyhow and we located a mailslot that lead outside the bar nearby the stage. 'We ran our cables through the mailslot I could play and sing along to my band performing inside. The band was muffled but audible from outside and we were able to play our set without any major hiccups. 'It was hilarious to perform to the streets of Chicago and watch the faces of confused passerby. People came from inside the bar to watch as well. All in all, it turned out to be a fun and creative solution to the problem and certainly beat going home unpaid that night. ' In 2007, English folk singer songwriter Laura Marling was refused entry to her own gig in Soho because she was just 17 at the time. People who had traveled to see her play instead found her busking outside the venue.","Michigan band Wayne Szalinski due to play in Chicago bar during tour .
