"A Utah woman says she has smashed the world record for catching bridal bouquets at weddings and now is seeking recognition for it. Salt Lake City's Jamie Jackson submitted an application Wednesday to Guinness World Records, saying she has caught 46 bouquets since 1996 and has the documentation to prove it. The current record of 11 bouquets caught by Stephanie Monyak of Pennsylvania has stood since 2004. Scroll down for video . Salt Lake City's Jamie Jackson submitted an application Wednesday to Guinness World Records to set the new bouquet catching record . Jackson says she's caught 46 of the floral arrangements and can prove it . Jackson said she has attended as many as 100 weddings over the years because of her family's connections to musical theater and their church. She jokes that what started out as a hobby has turned into ""her sport."" 'It is something that you have to plan for and you have to be very strategic where you place yourself,' she told KSL. 'My strategy is to be right up in the front because a lot of time the brides don't know how far they are going to throw it. 'A lot of times it will hit a ceiling, it'll hit a chandelier ... I've had many, many catches where I've had to jump for it. And I've hit little kids by accident.' Before she could apply to Guinness, Jackson had to track down all the brides whose bouquets she caught to obtain documentation and photos. She said she was happy to learn 44 of the 46 brides were still married. 'I consider myself a good luck charm,' she said. Jackson says she always gets in front of the crowd for a better chance at catching the bouquet . She keeps the bouquets in a glass case on display in her home. As an event planner for Noah's Event Venue she was also invited to several weddings over the years giving her more opportunities. Jackson has dispelled the myth that a woman who catches a bouquet will be the next to get married. She said some people joke that she's purposely staying single to catch more bouquets, but she assures them that is not the case. 'It's just been a fun process over the years,' she said.","Jamie Jackson submitted an application on Wednesday to Guinness World Records, saying she has documentation to prove her catches .

"Some people wear their intricate tattoos as a badge of pride, while others bitterly regret their inkings. Now a pain-free treatment to erase unwanted designs may be on the horizon in the form of a cream. The lotion targets blood cells that have been coloured by the tattooing process and is said to be safer than lasers, which are currently used to remove ink. Scroll down for video . A pain-free treatment to erase unwanted inkings may be on the horizon in the form of a cream that can fade away tattoos (stock image) The cream targets cells that have been coloured by the tattooing process . While lasers break down ink particles in tattoos and are then absorbed into the body, Alec Falkenham, a PhD student in Pathology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, has come up with a different approach. It makes use of the natural healing process that is used by skin after it’s tattooed in the first place. When a person is tattooed, pigment from the ink is consumed by white blood cells called macrophages, after being injected into the skin. ‘Macrophages are known as the big eaters of the immune system,’ Mr Falkenham explained. ‘They eat foreign material, like tattoo pigment, to protect the surrounding tissue.’ Macrophages react to ink in different ways. One set of the cells transports some of the pigment to draining lymph nodes to remove it from the area. The technology, dubbed Bisphosphonate Liposomal Tattoo Removal (BLTR), targets blood cells called macrophages that contain pigment. A magnified image of a macrophage cell is shown . Alec Falkenham (pictured), a PhD student in Pathology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia came up with the idea for the new cream ans is in the process of turning his research into a business . Lasers are most commonly used to remove tattoos. They break down the ink particles in a tattoo, which are then absorbed by the body - mimicking the natural fading that time or sun would allow. Yellows, greens, pastels and fluorescent inks are harder to erase than black and blue. The process often requires multiple visits. Areas with thin skin are likely to scar and people say the process is often more painful than getting a tattoo. The pain is often described to be similar to that of hot oil on the skin, or a 'snap' from an elastic band. After the treatment, the skin can be inflamed with white discolouration and 'pinpoint' bleeding can occur before a scab forms. Side effects can include a change in skin pigmentation and texture as well as in rare cases, allergic reactions and scarring. Throughout history, dermabrasion with chemicals to remove the top layer of skin, scrubbing it with salt and even skin grafts have been used to erase tattoos. Some early forms of tattoo removal included injections or applications of wine, lime, garlic or even pigeon excrement. The other population of macrophages that has ‘eaten’ the pigment, goes deeper into the skin to form the visible tattoo. Over time, the macrophages that formed the tattoo are replaced by new macrophages, causing the body art to blur and fade. There is no need for injections or painful inflammation, and gradually the tattoo fades, he said. Mr Falkenham’s technology, dubbed Bisphosphonate Liposomal Tattoo Removal (BLTR), targets the macrophages that contain the pigment. The cream contains liposomes, which are man-made spherical vesicles normally used as vehicles for administering drugs. ‘When new macrophages come to remove the liposome from cells that once contained pigment, they also take the pigment with them to the lymph nodes, resulting in a fading tattoo,’ he said. Mr Falkenham claims that the BLTR technology is a safer alternative to current tattoo removal processes such as lasers, which can be painful. He told CBC: ‘When comparing it to laser-based tattoo removal, in which you see the burns, the scarring, the blisters, in this case, we've designed a drug that doesn't really have much off-target effect. ‘We're not targeting any of the normal skin cells, so you won't see a lot of inflammation. In fact, based on the process that we're actually using, we don't think there will be any inflammation at all and it would actually be anti-inflammatory.’ By acting like a ‘Trojan horse’ in their drug delivery, liposomes target cells that can consume them, specifically those that contain pigment. Mr Falkenham claims that the cream is a safer alternative to current tattoo removal processes such as lasers (a stock image is shown), which can be painful and leave behind blistering, for example . This limits potential side effects to the small number of surrounding cells that do not contain pigment. Mr Falkenham has patented his technology and is now working on commercialising it, which means that the cream could one day be an option for removing tattoos. He is unsure when this may be and how many applications will typically be needed to completely erase an inking, but said that the treatment could cost as little as four cents per square centimetre and will work best on tattoos older than two years old. The researcher has four tattoos himself and regrets none of them, ‘but that’s probably a reflection on me waiting until I was older,’ he said.","Cream was created by a PhD student at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia .

"Tasteless food and poor service don’t only ruin a meal. They also make it traumatic. A study found that diners who give restaurants bad reviews use language and grammar very similar to that of people who have survived terrorist attacks and mass shootings. Linguist Dan Jurafsky said that people who post online reviews might think they are writing about food but they are actually revealing their psychological state. A new study suggests that terrible food (stock image) and service in restaurants can make a meal traumatic. A study found that diners who give restaurants bad reviews use language and grammar very similar to that of people who have survived terrorist attacks and mass shootings . The tendency of those unhappy with their meals to use ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’, rather than ‘I’ is particularly revealing. Professor Jurafsky, of Stanford University, in California, said: ‘It turns out that there's previous scientific literature showing exactly that characteristic constellation of linguistic features characterising a particular genre and that genre is the genre of people writing after they've been traumatised. ‘So people writing after 9/11, or students writing in the campus paper after a campus tragedy, use exactly this language. ‘In particular they use the first person plural, they say this bad thing happened to us as a group and we're going to get through it together. ‘This idea of getting through suffering collectively is there in these reviews.’ People who write negative restaurant reviews (a stock image is pictured) often use ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’, rather than ‘I’, indicating that the experience leaves the scarred, according to linguist Dan Jurafsky . The study found that people change the way they write about food in restaurant reviews, and it reveals a lot about their state of mind. For example, people who had a bad experience, tended to use we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’, rather than ‘I’ – like victims of trauma. Delicious food that is also expensive is written about in sensuous and sexy terms, such as an ‘orgasmic’ pastry or ‘seductively seared foie gras’. But tempting fast food is described as a drug – for example, ‘craving’ cupcakes, likening fries to crack and ‘addictive’ chicken wings. Professor Jurafsky said that people may feel less guilty about eating fast food if they think of it as a drug that they simply couldn’t resist. He added that while the diners’ distress is minor compared to that experienced by victims of real tragedies, it still leaves them scarred. The professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s (AAAS) annual conference: ‘We’re very sensitive to personal interaction and can really be injured by things that are not going to kill us but really affect us.’ His analysis of a random selection of almost one million reviews about more than 6,500 US restaurants also revealed that those who said they had a bad time wrote little about the food. Instead, they tended to be upset by rude staff and being made to wait for their meals. The study also revealed our interesting choice of words when describing food that we like. Delicious food that is also expensive is written about in sensuous and sexy terms but tempting fast food is described as a drug. The study also revealed our choice of words when describing food that we like. For example, a pastry (stock image pictured left) was described as ‘orgasmic.' Analysis of restaurant menus found that the use of long words to describe a dish is a sign that it will be pricey, so decaffeinated coffee (right) would be more expensive . For instance, an expensive pastry was ‘orgasmic’ and someone who enjoyed their foie gras said it was ‘seductively seared’. One very happy diner had ‘very naughty deep-fried pork belly’. In contrast, tasty cupcakes were ‘craved’ and good chips were likened to crack cocaine. Professor Jurafsky said that people may feel less guilty about eating fast food if they think of it as a drug that they simply couldn’t resist. A separate analysis of restaurant menus found that the use of long words to describe a dish is a sign that it will be pricey. The professor said: ‘For every extra letter describing a dish, the dish was 18cents (10p) more expensive.’ This suggests that a decaffeinated coffee would be 80p dearer than a cheap and cheerful ‘decaf’.","Linguist Dan Jurafsky said people who write negative restaurant reviews tend to use language such as ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our,’ rather than ‘I’

"Rasheem Dowdy of Allentown has been convicted of attempted murder and robbery after shooting a snake dealer at a suburban Philadelphia shopping center . A Pennsylvania man who shot a snake dealer at a suburban Philadelphia shopping center has been convicted of attempted murder and robbery. The Delaware County Daily Times reports that 35-year-old Rasheem Dowdy of Allentown was also convicted in Delaware County of aggravated assault, robbery of a motor vehicle and a firearms count. Ridley Township police said Dowdy arranged to buy $12,600 worth of snakes but then robbed the breeder in the Woodlyn Shopping Center parking lot in January 2012. The robber shot the dealer and fled in his SUV but crashed it in nearby Folsom. Police later recovered a handgun and a jacket containing another gun. Prosecutors said DNA tests of the weapons and clothing matched a sample taken from Dowdy. The Daily Times reports that snake breeder Mark L. Haas said he had come early to the Woodlyn Shopping Center to meet the customer who'd been texting him about the snakes. Haas told authorities that as he was returning to his SUV from a bathroom trip while waiting for the contact, he locked eyes with another man and became worried. He told Assistant District Attorney Sandra Urban that as he began to open the door he felt someone behind him. 'He pushed me and opened the car door the rest of the way, pointed a gun at me and threatened to kill me,' Haas recalled. 'He said, “Throw your keys on the ground, this is real, I’ll kill you.’' Dowdy started to get into the SUV's driver door the victim backed away to the rear passenger door. Afraid Dowdy would shoot him, he didn't run. However Dowdy opened fire anyway, lodging a bullet in Haas's back. He then allegedly fled the scene.

"The BBC1 adaptation of JK Rowling's novel  The Casual Vacancy has triumphed in the head-to-head battle of Sunday night dramas. The Casual Vacancy, starring Michael Gambon, Rory Kinnear and Keeley Hawes, and Channel 4's 'epic' period drama Indian Summers, featuring Julie Walters in the lead, were pitted against each other at 9pm. The small-screen version of Rowling's first novel for adults won the most viewers, peaking with 7.3 million. The TV adaptation of JK Rowling's The Casual Vacancy had an average of 6.6 million viewers last night . It beat off competition from Channel 4's new drama Indian Summers, starring actress Julie Walters . The drama, set in the seemingly idyllic, fictional English village of Pagford, where residents are at war with each other, enjoyed an average of  6.6 million viewers and a 27.5% share of the audience. Indian Summers, set in the foothills of the Himalayas during the decline of the British Raj and the birth of modern India, attracted a peak of 3.4 million and an average of 2.9 million (13.4%) including viewers catching up on the plus one channel. The latest instalment in ITV series Mr Selfridge took 3.5 million (14.5%) with plus one. None of the three big-hitting 9pm dramas could better long-running Call the Midwife though, which drew in an average of 8.9million viewers. It was screened on BBC1 at 8pm - pitting it against Top Gear on BBC2 and All Star Family Fortunes on ITV. Channel 4 said that they were delighted with the launch of their 10-part series, which  more than doubled its slot average and was the 'highest drama launch since Elizabeth I' in 2005. The broadcaster's chief creative officer Jay Hunt  said: 'I'm thrilled that three million people were hooked by Indian Summers' unique mix of political intrigue and raw passion. It's an epic drama, uniquely Channel 4 in tone.' It was revealed last week that The Casual Vacancy's ending has been changed for the small-screen to feature a 'redemptive moment', after its scriptwriter decided the novel's conclusion was a little too 'grim'. Despite the tweaks, Harry Potter author Rowling has said that she is 'thrilled' with the TV adaptation. ITV series Mr Selfridge brought in more viewers than Indian Summers - with 3.5million tuning in . None of the three 9pm dramas drew in as many viewers as long-running Call the Midwife - starring Emerald Fennell, Charlotte Ritchie, Helen George  and Linda Bassett - which was seen by nearly 9million people . Sunday evening has repeatedly seen some the largest viewing figures of the week - leading major channels to screen their best-loved shows. The battle reached its peak two years ago when Call the Midwife - still screened at 8pm on BBC1 - and ITV's Downton Abbey were both screened on the same evening. The two channels have previously put the results shows of their two hits Strictly Come Dancing and X Factor against each other on Sunday evening. The Casual Vacancy is BBC1's adaptation of Harry Potter JK Rowling's drama set in an English village .","Three main channels went to war last night, all screening dramas at 9pm .

"He may be laying low for six months. But disgraced Nightly News anchor Brian Williams couldn't escape ridicule in one of the biggest comedy events in TV history. On the red carpet for Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary Jim Carrey alarmed Today newscaster Matt Lauer when he bluntly asked: 'Where are you hiding Brian Williams?' Tina Fey's eyes widened and Savannah Guthrie squealed during an awkward pause before Lauer exclaimed: 'Look at the time!' And during the three-hour episode, Jerry Seinfeld took to the stage to say: 'I just found out one of the original cast members was Brian Williams. I don't know if that's true... doesn't sound true.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jerry Seinfeld took to the stage to say: 'I just found out one of the original cast members was Brian Williams. I don't know if that's true...' Awkward! Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie maintained smiles but Tina Fey turned awkwardly as Jim Carrey asked about Brian Williams . Awkward moment: Carrey demanded to know where the disgraced Nightly News host is . Williams, who has been suspended for six months without pay for allegedly fabricating anecdotes, is the only news anchor to have hosted the show. But happily for Williams, the jokes at his expense were barely a fraction of the material on Sunday evening. Musicians, actors, and politicians alike lined up on the red carpet to tell Lauer, Gutherie, Al Roker and Carson Daly how much they love the show. And the first joke of the night came when Kanye West spoofed himself at the end of the red carpet by interrupting the hosts as they wrapped up. Williams, who has been suspended for allegedly fabricating anecdotes, is the only news anchor to have hosted the show. He is pictured here with Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers during weekend update in 2007 . On again: Here he played the character of Carl Bacon alongside Kristen Wiig as Cheryl Bryant in 2007 .

Heavyweight guest: Donald Trump, pictured with wife Melania, told Carson Daly he is 'honored' to be attending the historic event . Seth Meyers attributed the success of the show to creator Lorne Michaels' 'good taste'. In a moving tribute, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani remembered the show's first post-9/11 show as 'one of the most patriotic moments for this show, maybe for America.' Sarah Palin spoke alongside Alec and Hilaria Baldwin to hail the show as a center for 'the most intelligent and comedic minds in America in one place.' She appeared on the show in 2008, during her presidential campaign, beside a lookalike version of herself played by Tina Fey. In a nod to that episode, she told Lauer and Guthrie: 'If this is indicative of the campaign it was the most fun moment of the campaign.' Musical opening: Jimmy and Justin danced and sang to open the episode before screaming 'Live in New York it's Saturday night!' Honoring hosts: After the opening credits rolled, Steve Martin came out for a monologue and was joined by Chris Rock and Miley Cyrus . Palin was stood with Alec Baldwin, with whom she shared an awkward cold open in 2008. Baldwin said: 'We get to relax and have fun regardless of people’s politics. And I often think, if only Lorne Michaels could produce the Congress, maybe we’d have more fun and we would get more done.' Donald Trump told Daly he is 'honored' to be attending the historic event. Despite suggestions to the contrary, former cast member Chevy Chase, who first pioneered the Weekend Update news spoof segment, turned up. Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake opened the episode with a musical number and the words: 'Live in New York it's Saturday night!' Steve Martin followed. Opening the show, he said: 'Tonight is like an enormous high school reunion, a high school that is almost all white. 'Tonight we’re going to honor pay tribute to those greats who are no longer with us,' before naming John Belushi and Gilda Radner - as well as Jon Lovitz who was stood there shaking his head.","Matt Lauer, Savannah Guthrie, Carson Daly and Al Roker were interviewing the dozens of guests on SNL red carpet .

"In her latest rant, controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham, 24, launched a scathing attack on Christians, calling them 'gullible' NHS boob-job scrounger Josie Cunningham has launched a scathing attack on Christianity by calling the Virgin Mary a 'slut' who 'blates had it off with one of the three kings behind the stable'. In her latest rant, the 24-year-old, who shot to notoriety after boasting about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, also called Christians 'gullible' for believing the Old Testament. She then turned on one of the religion's most sacred figures, before suggesting the immaculate conception was better suited to the Jeremy Kyle show. She tweeted: 'Christians are so gullible! Virgin Mary my arse, more like ""Slut Mary"". She Blates had it off with one of the three kings behind the stable.' The mother-of-three then added: 'If I tried to claim I had an immaculate conception you would ship me straight off to the Jeremy Kyle show!' As is par for the course with Miss Cunningham's outbursts, it was only a matter of minutes before angry Twitter users responded in a backlash, with one replying: 'Anyone who uses the word 'Blates' does not have the intelligence to have any kind of opinion on anything.' Another said: 'You clearly don't know how contraception works,' while others said she would 'never be welcome' on the Jeremy Kyle show. But the ITV chat show soon caught wind of the discussion and appeared to suggest she would be welcome on the show, saying: 'well, well, well...' The controversial wannabe glamour model, who recently appeared in a documentary entitled: 'The most hated woman in Britain?', has previously offended different groups with her outspoken comments. During the two-minute silence on Armistice Day, she tweeted: 'I wanna scream, and shout, and let it all out!!!!! **waves hands in the air like a mad man**'. She also slammed breastfeeding as 'borderline incest'. Miss Cunningham became infamous after having a boob enhancement operation, funded by taxpayers, to increase her breasts from a 32A to a 36DD. She has since continued to make headlines, even starring in her own real-life documentary earlier this month, which showed Miss Cunningham  revelling in attention from paparazzi and members of the public. She had previously revealed how she had become engaged by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online, but Miss Cunningham is now said to be single. The mother-of-three (left) called Mary (right) a 'slut' and said she 'blates had it off with one of the three kings' The  boob-job scrounger recently appeared in a documentary called Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain? Today's episode is the latest in a long line of controversial statements which the mother-of-three has shared with her 108,000 Twitter followers. Last November, Miss Cunningham revealed to her followers how she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her baby daughter Grace by sending him the wrong DNA result. She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day. But she allegedly mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man. Miss Cunningham's latest outburst attacked Christians and one of the most sacred figures in its religion . The former escort, from Leeds (pictured heavily pregnant last year), told Twitter followers that she would be 'shipped off to the Jeremy Kyle show' if she claimed to have had an immaculate conception . Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders. But her most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. However, she later claimed she 'changed her mind' after discovering her baby was to be a little girl. She later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. It wasn't long before dozens of people created a backlash on Twitter, questioning Miss Cunningham's views . The former escort made headlines again when she said she wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. Towards the end of last year, the controversial wannabe glamour model stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her heavily pregnant bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. She decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. But she later cancelled the event.","24-year-old said Christians are 'gullible' for believing in the Old Testament .

"The FBI have reportedly been questioning elderly men after their names came up in a new investigation into the lynching of four black victims almost 70 years ago. On July 25, 1946, two African-American married couples were shot dead near the Moore's Ford Bridge in Georgia. Second World War veteran George W. Dorsey, his wife Mae Murray, and Roger Malcom with his wife Dorothy were attacked by a gang of white men on their way home, believed to be Ku Klux Klan members. The couples were tied to a tree and shot around 60 times. Dorothy Malcom, who was seven months' pregnant, had her unborn baby cut out with a knife. Scroll down for video .

Farmer Loy Harrison (pictured left on July 26, 1946) shows Sheriff J.M. Bond, center, and Coroner W.T. Brown, where two black couples were slain by a mob of white men near Monroe, Georgia . White farmer Loy Harrison was driving home the two black couples, whom he employed as sharecroppers on his land. There were whisperings around town that George Dorsey had secretly been dating a white woman, a taboo in the segregated South. And there was no love lost between the townsfolk and Roger Malcom, who had stabbed a white farmer during a knife fight 11 days earlier. He was still waiting in jail when Harrison paid $600 to bail him out. When Harrison's truck rolled near the crossing, a white mob grabbed the two couples from the vehicle, dragged them down a nearby trail and tied them to trees. Using rifles, shotguns and pistols, the mob fired three volleys of bullets, leaving their bodies behind slumped in the dirt, according to investigators. President Harry Truman dispatched the FBI to Monroe, a town about 45 miles east of Atlanta. The feds, however, were met with a wall of silence. Harrison, the farmer who claimed he'd been 'ambushed' but was unharmed, told investigators he didn't recognize the dozen or so unmasked assailants. Other whites abided by a code of silence. Black people, too, kept quiet, petrified of reprisal if they spoke out. Several suspects were named in the FBI's 1946 investigation, but, partly due to a lack of witnesses, none was ever charged. Now a lengthy investigation by the Equal Justice Initiative this month has produced names of potential suspects and campaigners were urging authorities to seek justice for the decades-old crimes before it's too late. The report revealed that there were 3,959 lynchings of black people in 12 states in the South between 1877 and 1950 - at least 700 more lynchings than previously reported. According to The Guardian, an 86-year-old man in Monroe, Georgia has been questioned over his involvement in the lynchings but said he had nothing to do with the brutal killings. Charlie Peppers said: 'The blacks are blaming people that didn't even know what happened back then.' He also denied ever being a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Daily Mail Online was awaiting on a comment from the Atlanta field office of the FBI on Monday. The brutal deaths of the two black couples caused outrage in the U.S. and sparked protests.

"A Christian militia fighting against the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group in northern Iraq has been joined by a man from Australia. The ABC reports that Melbourne man Khamis Gewargis Khamis joined an Assyrian militia called Dwekh Nawsha, which translates as 'self sacrificers'. After the Islamic State's assault on the Assyrian minority in Iraq the militia was formed in response. Across the north of the country IS has forced tens of thousands of Assyrians from their homes. Khamis Gewargis Khamis is fighting in northern Iraq for an Assyrian militia called Dwekh Nawsha . 'They don't discriminate when it comes to killing, torture and so on,"" Mr Khamis told the ABC from his base in northern Iraq. 'These are barbaric people, they came here only to die for what they believe in, so you can imagine the terror that they are spreading among the families, the kids and so on.' He is stationed with other Dwekh Nawsha fighters in a town called Baqofa, around 30 kilometres from the major IS-held city of Mosul. Mr Khamis is married and has two children. Just two kilometres down the road is a town called Batnay, which is on the front line. IS holds the town after driving out the Christian inhabitants. Kashmiri demonstrators hold up a flag of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) during a demonstration against Israeli military operations in Gaza . 'In the last few days (Islamic State) have been trying to come to these towns. They were somehow stopped by the coalition forces, from the air, and Peshmerga as well,' Mr Khamis said. 'We are on frontline, so last few nights there has been bombing from both sides, shelling. So yes, Dwekh Nawsha is frontline, trying to defend this town as much as we can. 'We have to have our own force, so we do need support as much as we can. We are appealing to the international community, particularly Australia, to help as well. Iraqi government forces celebrate while holding an Islamis Sate (IS) group flag after they claimed they gained complete control of the Diyala province, northeast of Baghdad .

'We are concerned, but if anything happens because of my travel here and supporting and joining Dwekh Nawsha I am happy and prepared to stand in front of the law. 'We would like the entire international community to be stronger, to get together and urgently help (the Assyrians) from the humanitarian side, and also to do what they can to eradicate (Islamic State), to eliminate them, to drive them out of these towns, villages and these territories so the people can return back to their homes and their lands.'","Khamis Gewargis Khamis joined an Assyrian militia called Dwekh Nawsha .

"Gary Lyon has been jailed for stealing from his own mother and conning people into giving him money by telling them his daughter was lying in hospital and he needed cash to get to see her . A conman who duped strangers into giving him money by pretending his 11-year-old daughter had cancer has been jailed for 18 months. Gary Lyon, 47, told generous well-wishers that his child was lying, gravely ill, in hospital in Manchester 'with tubes coming out of her arms.' In fact, a daughter of Lyon, who is now 15, had contracted leukaemia in 2009 when she was younger but had made a full recovery. Lyon scammed victims by falsely claiming he had run out of petrol on the way to see her in hospital. On one occasion he targeted an 80-year-old woman after he told her his bank card had snapped and he needed £20 to buy fuel. Graham Robinson, prosecuting, said: 'The first complainant... was was approached by the defendant who used a ruse he was to repeat many times, saying his daughter was in The Christie Hospital and he had run out of petrol.' The father of two from Sharston, near Wythenshawe, Manchester claimed he would repay the cash but gave a false name and telephone number. On another occasion, he was given £10 by a stranger after saying he needed to pick his daughter up from hospital following surgery to treat leukaemia. He even told the victim: 'Mate, that's really not enough. £20 will see me through.' In yet another incident, Lyon showed a tattoo of his daughter's name to a man and after getting £20 said: 'I swear on my daughter's life I will pay you back.' Lyon told a fourth victim who gave him £40: 'You are the kindest man I ever met.' Manchester Crown Court heard that in addition to the frauds, jobless Lyon, who has 42 previous convictions, repeatedly stole from his 70-year-old disabled mother, Anna. Whilst she was on holiday in America, Lyon stole her bank card and began plundering her funds in order to fund his £50-a-day crack cocaine habit. The court heard Lyon stole the bank card and used a mobility scooter before withdrawing £1,500 on 23 occasions using a telephone banking service. She returned from her holiday to find her son had taken £6,000 worth of jewellery which was later retrieved from a pawnbrokers. One of Lyon's victims admitted he was suspicious of Lyon's sob story and even told him: 'If you are lying, you will go to hell.' Lyon told  one of his victims that his daughter was in Manchester's Christie Hospital 'with tubes in her arms' He later told police: 'I didn't really believe a word but thought it's better to be conned than be wrong and this is someone genuinely in that situation.' Lyon pleaded guilty to four thefts, eight counts of fraud and one count of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent. In mitigation, defence counsel Tom McKail said: 'The offences committed by this defendant against the public are deplorable and he is disgusted and embarrassed by his behaviour. 'He has also taken advantage of a previously supporting and loving family and apologises to all parties who have been affected by his behaviour and selfish ways. 'At the end of 2012 the defendant's daughter did indeed suffer from leukaemia but recovered, but while given the all clear his relationship with his then-partner, the mother of his two daughters deteriorated. As a by-product he fell back into a way of life he believed he had left behind.' Sentencing Lyon, judge Miss Recorder Fiona Barry said: 'You repeatedly used your daughter's previous ill health to illicit sympathy and generosity to fund your drug addiction. Some victims were vulnerable and another was scared. It is not possible to suspend this sentence.'","Fraudster's daughter once had disease but made complete recovery .

"A Costa coffee customer was left horrified after she found a worker's blood mixed in with her latte. Janine Hughes bought the hot drink from the chain's drive-through store in Swansea, South Wales and thought it tasted strange. The 30-year-old was sickened when she opened the lid and found fresh blood staining the inside of her cup and mixed with the coffee. Today she told how she drove back to the outlet and discovered the source of the blood was a barista who had cut his hand while making drinks . Janine Hughes has complained after her discovering blood mixed in with her latte from Costa coffee . The 30-year-old IT worker had bought the drink at the chain's 'drive thru' store in Swansea, South Wales, but removed the lid to find blood on the inside of the cup . She is now nervously awaiting blood test results to check she did not catch anything from the contaminated coffee. Ms Hughes complained to the manager, who gave her a new latte, and later received a letter from the area manager. But she has yet to receive a response to an official complaint she made to the company's headquarters. She said: 'I drove off and took two sips of my latte and it tasted like iron. I realised something was wrong, but did not know what at the time. 'Then I saw blood on the inside of the lid and realised there was blood in the coffee. 'I was filled with horror when I realised what I had just drunk. I drove back and asked to see the manager.'

She is now awaiting tests to check she did not catch anything  and has vowed never to visit the chain again . The barista had then gone to dress his wound while another staff member changed the lid, but the drink already had blood mingled in with the milk and coffee. IT worker Ms Hughes added: 'The person who served me was mortified. But I should have been given a completely new coffee and not just a new lid. 'I was given a new latte in the end but I had to report it - it was too serious to ignore.' Ms Hughes said she will never drink at the any of the chain's outlets again. She added: 'Not once have they contacted me. They have hidden behind the brand. That is terrible. 'I have had the worry of the blood tests. I don't think I will ever go to Costa again. I will support my local coffee shops.' A Costa Coffee spokesman said: 'Our area manager has spoken to Ms Hughes and apologised for the distress this obviously caused her.

"First Fifty Shades: E.M. Hull published her erotic novel The Sheik in 1919 aged 39 . We all know the story. One day, a frustrated, middle-aged housewife decides to write some erotic fiction for her own pleasure. The writing style is not brilliant, but what she writes is raunchy, involving a naive young woman forced to submit to a dominant older man, and pushed well beyond her sexual limits. Quietly pleased, the author decides to publish. Interest is initially slow, but it picks up beyond her wildest dreams. The book sells in its millions on both sides of the Atlantic, is made into a blockbuster Hollywood movie and the author earns a fortune. All this success comes despite the fact this tale of abuse and sadomasochism is panned by critics, as ‘poisonously salacious’ and glorifying ‘lust and lechery’. The author is not deterred. ‘I am old-fashioned enough to believe a woman’s best love is given to the man she recognises as her master,’ she states, and produces two equally saucy sequels. You would be forgiven for thinking that this tale is about E.L. James and her mega-selling erotic novel, Fifty Shades Of Grey, the movie of which was released in cinemas at the weekend. But it is actually the story of another British writer, a woman born 83 years before James, whose dazzling success with a piece of highly controversial erotica is an eerily familiar forerunner to Fifty Shades. Stranger still, even her name is similar: E.M. Hull. Today, her name is largely forgotten, but many will know the 1921 film that was based on her epically successful novel — The Sheik. Starring Rudolph Valentino and Agnes Ayres, the film tells how a young British aristocrat called Lady Diana Mayo is kidnapped by a sheik, who holds her against her will until she falls in love with him. However, the film is tame compared with the book, in which Diana is repeatedly raped — and there are strong hints that the sheik sodomises her — until she submits to his will and accepts she must be his for ever. The notion that a woman can fall for her abuser is extremely unpalatable, and when Hull’s book was released in 1919, that sense of distaste was widely felt. ‘To state her theory concisely: the quickest way to reach a woman’s heart is a right hook to the jaw,’ wrote one critic. B ecause of this apparent subtext, many believed E.M. Hull was a man. In fact, E.M. Hull was Edith Maud Hull, the 39-year-old wife of a Derbyshire pig breeder. She was born on August 16, 1880 in London, the second child of a New York ship owner and his English opera singer wife. The family was prosperous, and lived in a large house in Croydon. They holidayed on the Isle of Wight, and at some point moved to Hampshire. The Sheik: The 1921 film version of E.M. Hull's The Sheik, starring Rudolph Valentino and Agnes Ayres, tells how a young aristocrat is kidnapped by a sheik, who holds her against her will until she falls in love with him . Vanilla version: The film is tame compared with the book, in which Diana is repeatedly raped until she submits to his will and accepts she must be his for ever . In 1899, the 19-year-old Edith married a 30-year-old civil engineer called Percy Winstanley Hull, who came from a family of Derbyshire landowners. His father had been a barrister, and the Hulls lived in splendour in a large house called The Knowle, near the village of Hazelwood, five miles north of Derby. A picture taken of Edith at her wedding — which is the only photograph of her to be published, and is printed here for the first time — shows the model of a Victorian bride, accepting of a life of predictable gentility. In 1902, Edith gave birth to their only child — a girl called Cecil. The couple gave her a boy’s name because they’d wanted a boy — a measure of the immensely socially conservative world in which Edith lived, and against which she would rebel, at least on paper. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Percy was called up. At 45, he would have been too old for the frontline, but it is likely his engineering skills were put to use. It was while her husband was absent that a frustrated and bored Edith picked up her pen. She said she wrote The Sheik ‘as a means of distraction at a time when I felt very much alone’. ‘Oh God! How she loved him!’ reads a typical passage. ‘Ahmed! And with a soundless cry the last remnant of her strength went all at once, and she fell weakly against the chief. He forced her to her knees, and, with his hand twined brutally in her curls, thrust her head back. There was a mad light in his eyes and a foam on his lips as he dragged the knife from his waistbelt.’ Another section reads: ‘Her body was aching with the grip of his powerful arms, her mouth was bruised with his savage kisses. She clenched her hands in anguish. “Oh, God!” she sobbed, with scalding tears that scorched her cheeks. “Curse him! Curse him!”’ Edith submitted her sadomasochistic tale to agent Curtis Brown, who sold it to a publisher in May 1919. What happened nearly a century ago is a parallel to the Fifty Shades phenomenon. Publicised purely by word of mouth, the book was snapped up largely by women, despite — or more likely, because — it was described as ‘lascivious pornography’. Copycat: Nearly 100 years later, an erotic novel written by a woman is once again dominating the bestseller lists and being turned into a Hollywood blockbuster - Fifty Shades of Grey . Unlike Fifty Shades, Edith’s book is not openly explicit, but the strong suggestions of violence, rape and sodomy were enough to make it sell 1.2 million copies in hardback alone. We don’t know the total number of sales in all editions, but do know that The Sheik sold more than all the other bestselling books of the inter-war period put together. Simiilarly, E.L James’s first novel in her Fifty Shades trilogy has outsold all seven Harry Potter books on Amazon’s UK site. As a result, both women earned a fortune. For the last reported financial year, E.L. James’s limited company turned over £44 million, netting her a post-tax profit of £25.4 million in that one year. Hull’s earnings were comparable. She sold the film rights to The Sheik for $5,000, which today would be around £500,000, and the theatrical rights for the equivalent of £100,000. Edith then sold the serial rights for three novels to a magazine for £300,000 at today’s value. In 1923, an American film company bought the rights to another of Edith’s saucy novels, The Desert Healer, for £2.5 million in today’s money. And in 1925, she sold the sequel to The Sheik to Fox films for £2 million. Including royalties for the eight books she published, she would easily have made the equivalent of £50 million. Edith and her husband lived in luxury at The Knowle, where Percy took up breeding prize-winning pigs. Despite her success, Edith remained an intensely private figure, and did not even go to the first night of The Sheik when it was shown in Derby. By some accounts, she was an austere figure. A great-niece recalled visiting her during the war, and being picked up from the station, despite petrol rationing, in a luxurious Daimler. ‘She was definitely of the “children should be seen, not heard” school of thought,’ the great-niece wrote. In March 1944, Percy died at the age of 74. Edith died three years later, aged just 66. Today, her legacy is still hotly debated. Some see The Sheik — aimed as it was at women — as being part of a rising tide of female emancipation, whereas other regard it as appallingly reactionary. Whatever your view, there’s no doubt the phenomenon of Fifty Shades is a story that has been told before, and will be told again . . . by another unassuming woman who will make a fortune.","E.M.

"British company Rolls-Royce has been accused of being involved in a multi-billion-dollar bribery scheme engulfing Brazil's state-owned oil producer. The engineering firm, a supplier of gas turbines for Petrobras oil platforms, allegedly paid bribes via an agent in exchange for a $100million (£65m) contract. Rolls-Royce said it had not received details of the allegations from the authorities, but added that it 'did not tolerate improper business conduct'. Allegations: British company Rolls-Royce has been accused of being involved in a multi-billion-dollar bribery scheme that is engulfing Brazil's state-owned oil producer Petrobras . Claims: The engineering firm, a supplier of gas turbines for Petrobras oil platforms like the one pictured, allegedly paid bribes in exchange for a $100million (£65m) contract . The company was named in court documents by former Petrobras executive Pedro Barusco who told police he personally received $200,000 (£135,000) from Rolls-Royce. He claims bribes were also paid to a ring of politicians and other bosses at the oil giant, it was reported by the Financial Times, which cited documents released by Brazil's federal court system. Petrobras is engulfed in a widening corruption scandal, in which billions of dollars were allegedly paid by companies in bribes to win contracts from the Brazilian firm. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce told MailOnline: 'We have not received details of the allegations made in recent press reports, nor have we been approached by the authorities in Brazil. 'We have always been clear that we will not tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance, including co-operating with authorities in any country.' Rolls-Royce responded to the allegations by saying that it did not tolerate improper business conduct . Shares in Rolls-Royce were down 1.1 per cent at 934.8 pence by 9.12am GMT, lagging Britain's bluechip index which was down 0.1 per cent. The company, the world's second-largest maker of aircraft engines, is also under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) into concerns of possible bribery and corruption in China and Indonesia, in a probe which dates back to 2012. Meanwhile, mounting allegations that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's party received hundreds of millions of dollars in the  scandal engulfing Petrobras have sent her poll ratings tumbling. Rousseff only embarked on a second term in office last month, having succeeded popular Workers Party (PT) predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2011.","British firm was named in court documents by former Petrobras executive .

"More than 900 British soldiers have had to face gunfire, town riots, wildlife and 45-degree heat as part of a recent 'back to basics' exercise in Kenya. Troops from the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland took part in the training manoeuvre alongside elephants, zebras and camels on the outskirts of Nanyuki, Kenya.

Morning call: Piper Stuart Gillies from Arran plays his pipes as the sunrises over Mount Kenya . Described as a 'sophisticated game of laser tag', troops had been armed with muzzled weapons loaded with blank rounds. Using a set of lasers and receivers attached to each soldier, any simulated injuries could be recorded as the 2nd Battalion went up against the British Army's Mercian regiment. The staged battle also included village riots staged by local Kenyans, employed to take part and add an extra dimension to the exercise. The soldiers were not told how events would unfold and had to react to developments around them as if they were real. At one point, troops had to intervene in a fictional village where actors had been hired to play out a clash over the made-up battle. This scene also saw staged blasts hitting the village, and the troops had to handle 'the victims' - locals using blood-covered prosthetic limbs.

New experience: A young soldier looks on during the staged riot on the outskirts of Nanyuki, Kenya . The training site in Kenya used to be seen as the primary base to prepare for deployments to Afghanistan but the the latest exercise was designed to 'reset the regiment's DNA' as an infantry unit. Commanding Officer Graeme Wearmouth said: 'Here, we've gone back to basics - a light infantry force working out of a backpack, living on our feet and demonstrating our capabilities against what we would call a near peer enemy; an enemy that is not an insurgent, but a more conventional force who have their own artillery, air support and those sorts of things. 'It's getting back to basics and resetting our DNA as infantrymen.' Under an agreement with the Kenyan government, six Army battalions carry out exercises in Kenya every year, and despite a diplomatic row last year over travel advice issued by the UK to Britons travelling to the east African country, it remains an important base. Commander Wearmouth added: 'It's such an important relationship we have (with Kenya). We're only here as guests of the Kenyan people and they are truly hospitable. 'We have many locals taking part as players in the exercise in some of the fictional villages and they do the job so well.'

Private Jade Baptie, from Edinburgh, was given a shock when a scorpion bit her hand. 'When we're being transported between spots you see hundreds of animals - sometimes elephants, baboons and lots of zebras - but when you're on the job you hardly notice them because you're concentrating so much,' the 23-year-old said. 'That's what happened when I got stung by a scorpion while I was pulling my bergen (backpack) off one of the trucks. 'It must've been underneath, I didn't see it and it stung me on my right hand. I had pins and needles and I felt a bit rough - like I had a really bad hangover - but the medics said it wasn't poisonous so it wore away and I just got on with it.' Although Askari Storm is a training exercise, the troops are pushed to their limits. Pipe Major Stuart Gillies, from Arran, said: 'The first lot of phases were in Archers Post where it was absolutely roasting, around 45 degrees. 'I think I managed three hours sleep in the first couple of days of the final exercise because we were moving and preparing at night.

'I just hope I've got enough energy to play the bagpipes in the final leg of the exercise, I'm thinking I'll do the Star Wars theme.' Private William Marshall, from Edinburgh, spent four hours digging one trench with his platoon after an overnight move. He said: 'Three of us worked non-stop to get in to the ground in the middle of a valley, which is so dry. 'My hands were sore, feet agony and we get a wee break before it's on to the next one.' Corporal Sam Donnachie from Dailly, South Ayrshire, was in the country with his regiment for the third time, just weeks before his wedding next month. 'We're getting married in the Old Kirk in Ayr, which has the full regimental colours hanging, a month after I get back from Kenya,' the 29-year-old said. Despite six weeks away, Cpl Donnachie said his fiancee Gemma was not worried about his trip being so close to their big day. 'She worries about everything at home usually but I think I've been away that much now - three tours of Afghanistan, two tours of Iraq - that she's okay with training in Kenya,' he said.","Hundreds of troops from Royal Regiment of Scotland took part in exercise outskirts of Nanyuki, Kenya .

"A grieving daughter had to be rushed to hospital after a coffin carrying her 290lb father snapped as it was lifted by pallbearers. 'I saw my father die twice,' said Debora Sebastianelli of the moment the dead man's  corpse spilled from his casket in the middle of his funeral.

Maurizio Sebastianelli, from Rome, had died without warning just days earlier, leaving his 23-year-old daughter, an only child, to take care of the funeral arrangements. She insists she warned undertakers in advance of the need for a reinforced coffin for her 290lb, 6ft tall father - and paid extra for one - so expected she had anticipated any weight-related calamities. But the material used in Mr Sebastianelli's coffin could not hold him. 'It snapped, they’d just lifted it up to take it away and there was a thud,' Miss Sebastianelli said. 'We had to take him in the church with a cover to hide the mess.' Quick-thinking funeral directors found a sheet of zinc to place beneath Mr Sebastianelli's coffin, but it was too late to save his daughter and other mourners from humiliation. 'It was a demeaning display,' she said. 'I watched my father and I was ashamed. He had been unlucky in life - died at age 52 of a heart attack - and was so even in death.'

"An aggressive new strain of HIV has been identified, scientists have warned. A new study found the strain, called CRF19, is capable of transforming from an infection to full-blown aids within just three years. That is considerably faster than the average conversion time of around 10 years - and can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected. Scientists were prompted to investigate after noting a growing number of reports of people in Cuba suffering a rapid progression to AIDS, within three years of infection. Experts say the new strain, identified in Cuba, causes patients to progress to AIDS within three years - so rapidly they may not even realise they have been infected. (Image shows a mature HIV virus infection spreading inside the body) HIV tests often do not detect the virus within the first few weeks of infection, sometimes months. Once a person develops the flu-like symptoms that characterise acute infection - usually coming two to four weeks after infection - the virus undergoes a latency period. During that time the virus replicates and lives inside the body, but does not cause any symptoms. That period can last between five and 10 years before AIDS develops, in most cases. But researchers at the University of Leuven in Belgium noted the CRF19 strain causes patients to make the transition to AIDS much faster. It can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected. Researcher Professor Anne-Mieke Vandamme told MailOnline: 'Cuban clinicians were asking us to collaborate with them to investigate why they were noticing an increase in patients progressing to AIDS much faster than before. 'We set up this  project and found that a particular recombinant strain, called CRF19, was strongly associated with fast progression. 'All patients infected with CRF19 were progressing to AIDS within three years after being infected - often as soon as they were diagnosed with HIV infection. 'We know that they were infected just one or two years earlier, since we have an HIV negative test from the patients in the study one or two years earlier. 'All these patients are offered treatment immediately, but some patients are at diagnosis so ill that they die before they can recover with treatment.' Before the HIV virus can enter human cells, it has to attach itself to them. It does so via anchor points, which are proteins on the cell membrane - the coating of every cell that separates it from the outside environment. In a normal infection, the virus first attaches itself to the anchor point known as CCR5. A new study found the strain, called CRF19, is capable of transforming from an infection to full-blown aids within just three years. That is considerably faster than the average conversion time of around 10 years . But in many patients, after experiencing many healthy years during their latent period, the virus then switches to another anchor point, known as CXCR4. It is that switch which tends to trigger a faster progression to AIDS. Researchers at the University of Leuven noted this new strain of the virus targets the second anchor point, CXCR4, early after infection. As a result the number of healthy years a patient experiences is drastically shortened, and a person will start to suffer the effects of AIDS much faster. Professor Vandamme, and an international team of scientists, studied the blood samples of 73 recently-infected patients. Fifty-two already had AIDS at diagnosis, while 21 had yet to see their infection move into the later, more serious stage. They compared these results with blood from 22 patients, who had progressed to AIDS after a normal healthy period living with HIV, of around a decade. Worldwide, more than 33 million people have HIV. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS is spread via blood, semen and breast milk. There is no cure for the infection, but AIDS can be kept at bay for many years with cocktails of antiretroviral drugs. The pandemic began more than 30 years ago and has killed up to 40 million people worldwide. But research published in July by the United Nations showed AIDS-related deaths worldwide dropped to 1.5 million last year, from 1.7 million the year before. That was the sharpest annual decline since the epidemic's peak in 2004 . and 2005 - and marked a 35 per cent drop from the 2.4 million deaths in both those years. New infections also fell to 2.1 million last year, down 38 per cent compared to the 3.4 million in 2001. But with more than half of the 35 million people with HIV unaware they are infected, the battle is far from over however, warned Michel Sidibe, head of UNAIDS - the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. In those patients infected with the new strain of HIV, researchers found abnormally high doses of the virus, and of a defensive molecule known as RANTES. The molecule is part of a person's natural immune system response, and acts to join itself to CCR5, to which most forms of HIV have to attach in order to enter the body's cells. The high concentration of RANTES suggests that most of the CCR5 were not available as anchor points for HIV. This, the scientists believe, may have caused the virus to bypass that first anchor point, instead going straight to the second, CXCR4. Their finding that all study patients who were infected with the new HIV variant, went on to develop AIDS within three years of infection supports the theory. Professor Vandamme said while the strain was first noticed in Africa, it only appears to be spreading in Cuba, where records so far show 144 infected. 'Since the study, we are aware of in total 144 patients being infected with this recombinant virus, probably much more,' she said. 'This recombinant virus originated in Africa but we are not aware that it is spreading there, we do see that it is spreading slowly in Cuba. 'So far it has not been noticed elsewhere.' Professor Vandamme, added: 'The worrying thing about this strain is that patients often get diagnosed with HIV infection and already have AIDS.' She said the majority of current treatments are equally effective against this new strain. One drug, though, which works by blocking the CCR5 anchor point, is not effective because the strain bypasses the anchor point. 'There are however sufficient other options for those patients, as long as they start treatment early enough,' she told MailOnline. 'So for patients infected with this aggressive CRF19, it is key to get tested early in order to start treatment early. 'That is in fact true for all HIV infections, but it is more crucial for this CRF19. 'In general, it is essential for individuals engaging in risky behaviour to get tested often, so that they can start treatment as early as possible.'","New strain of HIV found spreading in Cuba is known as CRF19 .

"A curry house has been fined £3,000 after two dead mice were discovered next to a sack of onions. Health inspectors also found rodent droppings in the kitchen and food stored inside a dirty shed when they visited Khans Tandoori and Balti Takeaway in Portsmouth, Hampshire. The kitchen sink was also dry and had no soap and the staff toilet was in a poor condition, while layers of dirt, grease and debris had built up in the areas where food was handled and stored. Khans Tandoori and Balti Takeaway in Portsmouth, Hampshire, has been fined £3,000 after these dead mice were discovered next to a sack of onions . Magistrates ordered the restaurant to pay a £1,800 fine, £1,117 in costs and a £36 victim surcharge, after owner of Harold Southsea Ltd, admitted five charges under hygiene legislation on behalf of the takeaway. Health officer Christopher Larkin from Portsmouth City Council had discovered the dead mice on sticky boards that had been put out to catch the vermin when he visited the restaurant last July. Staff were forced to close the restaurant to make emergency repairs, and it was only allowed to reopen once the kitchen had been cleaned and disinfected, and the food moved out of the lean-to shed. Other improvements were also made.

Inspectors found that the kitchen sink was dry and had no soap, while the staff toilet was in a poor condition . 'Food hygiene is of prime importance and we cannot allow poor standards and behaviour like this,' said Alan Cufley, head of environmental health at the Portsmouth City Council. 'When problems are found, we try to work with businesses to help them improve, but if necessary we will take appropriate action, including prosecution, to protect the public.' The restaurant admitted failing to maintain the premises in good repair, failing to maintain them in a clean condition, failing to protect food from risk of contamination, failing to protect the kitchen from pest entry, and failing to control pests. These bags of cleaning products were discovered when inspectors visited the takeaway in July last year . Mr Khan, who owns the takeaway, said: 'It's been cleaned up. Basically we have done everything that's required. 'We have been trying to improve it for the future. We have never had it this bad before. 'We have taken measures to have a clean kitchen.' Council environment chief Robert New said: 'There's just no excuse for mice to be in kitchens. 'It has been a priority since I took over. It's about protecting the public.' He added there has been a change of strategy at the council, with officers now tackling 'medium to bad' offenders as a priority, rather than looking at each restaurant in turn. Health inspectors also found food being stored inside this dirty shed.

"More than 110 Britons evacuated from Libya because of recent deterioration in the military conflict have arrived in Malta on board the HMS Enterprise. The group including 30 children and four pregnant women entered the Grand Harbour in the Mediterranean island's capital, Valletta, this morning following their journey from Tripoli. The staff were transported from the British embassy which has been shut down as a result of the worsening security situation in the North African country. Arrival: The HMS Enterprise makes its way into the Grand Harbour in Valletta, Malta, after evacuating 110 Britons from Libya . Arrival: A flag with the St George's Cross waves at the back of the boat as it enters the ancient harbour on the Mediterranean island . Fighting in Tripoli and the eastern city of Benghazi is the worst since the 2011 civil war that ended four decades of Muammar Gaddafi's rule, increasing international worries Libya is becoming a failed state. Three years after the war, Libya's fragile government and nascent army are unable to control heavily armed brigades of ex-rebels who refuse to disband and have allied themselves with competing political factions to become powerbrokers. HMS . Enterprise's commanding officer, Cdr Mark Vartan, said: 'This is a . period of uncertainty for UK citizens based in Libya but we have been . proud to play our part in enabling their move to safety. 'My . ship's company have adapted to the challenge superbly, making as much . space as possible and providing essential food, shelter and security for . the journey.' Young passengers: Two infants are carried off the ship behind their mother. They were among 12 infants on board the vessel . Grasp: A child looks at a crew member as he carries him onto the Grand Harbour . Luggage: A pushchair is unloaded from the ship which transported the evacuees amid the worsening security situation in Libya . Young passenger: A crew member bends down to tie up the shoelaces of a young girl who was on board the ship . Welcome: Evacuees smile as they are handed bottles of water on their arrival . Defence . Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'I thank the crew of HMS Enterprise for . their support and professionalism in carrying out this important task.' Between 100 . and 300 Britons are said to remain in Libya. Many of the consular staff . were evacuated last Monday but the ambassador and core staff remained, . although they will now also return to the UK. The precarious situation in Libya was laid bare last week when a British Embassy convoy in Libya came under fire. Embassy . staff escaped unscathed from the attack which occurred on Sunday . between Tripoli and Zawiya, a city in northwestern Libya. Guided: A female member of the Navy personnel carries a young boy with one arm and holds the hand of girl as she walks along the Grand Harbour . Docking: A worker prepares to catch a rope thrown from the British Royal Navy ship HMS Enterprise as it arrives at Valletta's Grand Harbour .

Protection: A British Royal Marine disarms a general-purpose machine gun on board the HMS Enterprise as it arrives at the Mediterranean . Security: The St George's Ensign flies above the HMS Enterprise as Navy personnel disarm a machine gun on deck . Michael Aron, the UK's ambassador to Libya, wrote on Twitter: 'There was an attempted carjacking on a British Embassy convoy this morning. Shots were fired at our vehicles but all staff safe.' The evacuation comes as 22 people died in a day of militia fighting for control of the international airport in the capital, a spokesman for Libya's interim government said. In a statement early today, it said 'heavily armed groups' have shelled 'civilian targets' endangering thousands of citizens and leaving hundreds of families displaced. Transfer: Yesterday the Britons were taken to the survey ship from Tripoli, Libya, in a smaller vessel before making their way to sanctuary in Malta . Journey: A photo released by the Ministry of Defence shows the vessel alongside the HMS Enterprise off the Libyan coast . Islamic militiamen are seen during a clash near Tripoli International Airport . Crisis in Libya yesterday . A fighter from Zintan brigade watches as smoke rises after rockets fired by one of Libya's militias struck and ignited a fuel tank in Tripoli yesterday. 22 people have died in a single day of fighting . Flames from the fuel depot light the night sky. In the last few days, sporadic fighting between rival militias has spread northwards in capital Tripoli, including into the area where the British embassy is situated . Islamist militias from the coastal city of Misrata led the assault on airport, seeking to seize it from militias from the mountain town of Zintan. The 22 people were killed yesterday alone, the latest casualties in fighting that has claimed more than 200 lives in recent weeks. Since the overthrow in 2011 of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi by rebels supported by British and French air strikes, the north African country has descended into a state of lawlessness as rival militias struggle for power and wealth. Escape: Chinese evacuees from Libya arrive at Piraeus port  in Athens, Greece . Chinese Ambassador to Greece Zou Xiaoli (in suit) welcomes his countrymen ashore . On Saturday a Greek naval frigate evacuated embassy staff and nearly 200 people from Greece, China and other countries . In the last few days, sporadic fighting between rival militias has spread northwards in Tripoli, including into the area where the British embassy is situated. The violence across Libya has prompted the closure of several foreign missions and the withdrawal of diplomats. On Saturday a Greek naval frigate evacuated embassy staff and nearly 200 people from Greece, China and other countries. Tourists have been advised against all travel to the country and the Foreign Office said an assisted departure was being prepared. Any Britons unable to take advantage of this opportunity to leave have been told they should find their way home on commercial flights, with limited departures from Misrata and Maitega airports. HMS Enterprise was launched at Appledore in Devon in 2002 and is designed to carry out a wide range of survey work, including support to submarine and amphibious operations. Since her first operational overseas deployment to the Mediterranean in late 2004, Enterprise has worked in the Gulf of Aden and Somali Basin, through West Africa to the Republic of South Africa, and off Iraq. She is the second Royal Navy ship to use azimuth thrusters, where the propellers are part of a swivelling pod, allowing for precise manoeuvring. On Wednesday, British Airways suspended flights to and from Tripoli up to and including Tuesday due to the security situation at the country's main international airport. An FCO spokesman added: 'Fighting has intensified in Tripoli, including around the British Embassy compounds. 'In the light of the deteriorating security situation, we are taking steps temporarily to suspend operations at the British Embassy in Tripoli after the planned assisted departure of British nationals. 'The UK Government has changed its travel advice to reflect the ongoing security situation. 'We advise against all travel to Libya and urge British nationals in Libya to leave through commercially available means. 'The British Embassy is arranging an assisted departure for British nationals. Places are limited and requests for travel will be strictly prioritised. 'We plan temporarily to suspend operations at the British Embassy following the assisted departure. We will not be able to offer consular assistance after August 4.' On September 11 2012 U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans - information management officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods - were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the U.S. Mission in the Libyan city, for which Al Qaeda in North Africa and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia were implicated.","HMS Enterprise has arrived at the Grand Harbour in Valletta .

"She has come a long way from her days as a Little Black Dress-clad Spice Girl. Now Victoria Beckham has made the transition to globally respected fashion designer, silencing her critics  by launching a hugely successful brand loved by A-listers and fashion editors alike. The mother-of-four unveiled her AW15 collection at New York Fashion Week on Sunday to a stellar front row, including husband David and their sons Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and daughter Harper, three, sitting alongside Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, and stylist Rachel Zoe. Scroll down for video . British designer Victoria Beckham unveiled her AW15 collection in New York on Sunday to critical acclaim . Victoria's family (L-R) Romeo, Brooklyn, Cruz , David and Harper sat by Anna Wintour on the frow . Shunning the trend for overexposure, currently championed by the likes of Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus and Miranda Kerr, Victoria's range was a much more modest affair. Her designs were full of cream midi skirts, voluminous knits and calf-scraping culottes - proving that more really is more - in a sophisticated neutral palette of cream, taupe, black and navy. Following her footwear debut last season, Mrs Beckham designed the shoes too, with calf-length boots in black and beige featuring a substantial heel. The entire collection went down a storm with Vogue's most esteemed fashion editors. Victoria's chunky knits and midi skirt ensembles that barely revealed an inch of flesh have been hailed as 'the new kind of sexy' Shunning the trend for overexposure loved on all the red carpets, Victoria's sophisticated and feminine collection still won plaudits . Last year,  the fashion bible hinted that Victoria's collection was reminiscent of the stuff they had seen on the Celine runway  before and commented that they'd like to see a 'bit more of her' in her designs. It seems she took note. With a new direction, 40-year-old Victoria's stand-out designs, which are clearly based on her own wardrobe, winning her plaudits. 'This was a sexy and sophisticated take that put shape at its centre for soft and womanly silhouettes,' wrote Vogue's Jessica Bumpus. Legendary Vogue International Editor, Suzy Menkes OBE, added: 'Bringing back sexy - a slither of flesh at the waist or a jigsaw of fabrics forming five shades of black - was only a sidebar to the main story: Victoria Beckham has made it as a designer. 'I can’t think of another celebrity who has been willing and able to create a unique style.' In her show notes, Mrs Beckham explained 'it is not about one theme - but instead thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel.' The creative process for this collection was an altogether different style. Mrs Beckham explains how she decided to start with her classic designs and re-imagine them for a new season. Mrs Beckham explained that she had been thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel . 'I began with the dress and looked at evolving and translating it,' she wrote. 'It was from here that the collection and its narrative developed and it has been liberating and surprising for me in terms of the creative process. 'Familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked. Volumes have been subverted, menswear elements re-engineered to fit the female form and twists, spirals, seams and asymmetry interplayed. Fabrics bounce and move, a swing is sculptural, and a more body conscious silhouette emerges... 'For me it is a collection full of possibilities.' Commenting on her range, The Telegraph's Ellie Pithers wrote: 'Equally successful were the mannish double-breasted navy cocoon coats with neat horn buttons; the herringbone coat with a bustle at the hip; the chunky cream and navy sweaters with ballooning sleeves; and the skirt made out of cream velvet bows - VB's answer to the ""modern day red carpet"" conundrum when worn with a simple chenille sweater. 'Familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked', explained Victoria. 'Fabrics bounce and move, a swing is sculptural, and a more body conscious silhouette emerges' Victoria Beckham seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this collection, with patent boots and luxurious coats . Victoria's collection went down a storm on social media with fashion editors such as Jo Ellison, right, hailing it as 'sexy' 'Sure, it's not a problem that vexes most of us, but she's got all her bases covered.' Fashion website WWD described the collection as 'a study in calm sexiness' and insisted plenty of women will be climbing over each other to wear it come autumn. This is the latest in a string of stylish hits for the star, who last year opened the doors to her flagship store on Dover Street. Then, she beat fashion powerhouse Alexander McQueen, a label loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, as well as her friend Stella McCartney for the prestigious title of Best Brand at the British Fashion Awards 2014. 'Whatever fashion people say about “Team VB” doing all the work, added Suzy Menkes. 'I believe that the foundation and flow of this collection could have come only from her.'","Vogue editors praised 40-year-old Victoria's 'stand-out' AW15 collection at New York Fashion Week .

"A mother begged a court to stop doctors withdrawing treatment from her terminally-ill child. At a late-night emergency hearing, the woman insisted her 18-year-old son should be given another chance to beat his brain tumour. She said it seemed doctors ‘wanted him to die’. But Mrs Justice Hogg ruled that medical intervention could end and he should be put on palliative care. As of last night his condition was unknown. The mother used a telephone link from the hospital where her unidentified son was being treated to address the Court of Protection late on Friday night. A neurosurgeon said the teenager had no more than two weeks to live and active treatment was futile. The mother used a telephone link from the hospital where her unidentified son was being treated to address the Court of Protection, pictured . But the mother said: ‘I don’t want to hear you say he has to die. I don’t want to be part of that. I’m afraid I can’t. I am fighting for my child’s life. ‘He is a sick child but he is coping. He is not dying. Give him a chance. Maybe chemo will work. He may have months to live. ‘It just seems you want him to die. The sooner the better. It makes me worry you are not acting in his best interests. You just want it to get over and done with.’ At one point during the hearing Mrs Justice Hogg ordered a break to allow the mother to go back to her son’s bedside. She said her son was absolutely adored by his family and they believed he would pull through. ‘He is a miracle child and has survived things you thought he would not. He deserves a chance,’ she added. ‘Doctors should treat the patient to the very end. That is how I see it. He deserves the right to be treated.’ Mrs Justice Hogg was told the teenager had been diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of one. Although also registered blind, he had been able to go to school, travel and play some sports. But doctors said that his condition had deteriorated and the cancer had spread. He could not walk or talk, struggled to lift his limbs and was ‘going in and out of coma’. But the parents disagreed that treatment should be stopped. The boy’s father had travelled to London to attend the hearing but returned to his son’s bedside after doctors said his condition had taken a turn for the worse. He held the phone for his wife as Mrs Justice Hogg made her ruling. The judge said the boy had shown resilience and courage, adding: ‘His mother has fought every corner for him. And he has fought a few corners for himself.’ But the judge said she had to base her decision on the evidence and decide what was in the teenager’s best interests. She made no criticism of doctors or medical staff. ‘The evidence shows that he is in the last phase of his life,’ she said. ‘The doctors say the time has now come for palliative treatment only. ‘I am satisfied that chemotherapy should not be resumed.’ She said the teenager should get as much palliative treatment and care as possible.","Mrs Justice Hogg ruled medical intervention could end for the 18-year-old .

"Vladimir Putin is behaving like a 'mid 20th-century tyrant' with the illegal annexation of Crimea, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has warned. He said the Russian President will pay a 'political and economic price' for what he is doing in the region but ruled out Britain offering arms to Ukraine. The comments echo Prince Charles’s warning last year that ‘Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler’. Scroll down for video . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned the Russian President Vladimir Putin will pay a 'political and economic price' for what he is doing in Ukraine . With Germany and France taking the lead in the negotiations, David Cameron has been criticised for allowing Britain to become a 'foreign policy irrelevance'. The aim is to draw up a possible joint document on implementing the much-violated September peace plan for eastern Ukraine concluded in Minsk, Belarus. That agreement also featured a demilitarised zone, though the battle lines have since changed, and the government in Kiev has offered a measure of autonomy to the separatists. Speaking on Sky News' Murnaghan, Mr Hammond insisted there had to be a political solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine and stressed that the proposed deal was 'one of the last opportunities Russia will have' to avoid further damage to its economy. He dismissed Mr Hollande's remark that this is the last chance for peace as 'apocalyptic language', arguing there was already a combat situation on the ground. But Mr Hammond added: 'This is one of the last opportunities that Russia will have to avoid yet further significant damage to its economy which is bound to happen if the intransigence of Vladimir Putin forces the rest of the world to increase and tighten the sanctions from which Russia's economy is already reeling.' Germany has ruled out providing lethal aid to the Ukrainian forces in contrast to the US which is considering supplying arms in certain circumstances. German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande travelled to Moscow last week to hold talks with Mr Putin . Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the defence select committee, warned against defence cuts . Cutting British defence spending could encourage further aggression by Russia, a senior Tory MP warned. Rory Stewart, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, said the Nato commitment to devoting at least 2 per cent of national wealth to the military was 'really key' to showing Vladimir Putin the alliance was serious over Ukraine. 'We need a manifesto commitment that lays out a long-term obligation,' he told BBC1's Sunday Politics: 'The 2 per cent is really key. 'If we look at Russia and Ukraine at the moment, Putin is testing us. He is testing our resolve; he wants to work out whether Nato is serious. 'One of the biggest indicators on that is we committed, at the Wales summit, to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence. We have encouraged lots of other countries to do the same thing.' Chancellor George Osborne insisted Britain remained 'hugely influential in the world'. But he refused to confirm the 2 per cent target would continue to be met after the election. 'We are currently hitting that target. I am not going to pre-judge our defence review. But people know that we care about our nation's security and defence because we have invested in the latest equipment. 'People know we have met the 2 per cent commitment and are meeting it today.' Mr Hammond said Britain's position was currently not to provide arms to Ukraine, adding: 'This is a national decision for each country to make. 'There is no military solution to this conflict. The Ukrainians can't beat the Russian army. That is not a practical proposition. There has to be a political solution and the Kremlin, Mr Putin, has to understand he will pay a political and economic price for what he is doing in the Ukraine. 'Britain's position is that at the moment we don't think supplying arms is the right thing to do but obviously if the situation on the ground changes we will keep that position under review.' He refused to be drawn on the circumstances under which the UK might consider supplying arms saying he would not talk about a hypothetical situation. Mr Hammond also said he believes the sanctions currently in place against Russia - combined with the falling oil price - are having the desired effect despite Mr Putin's public reassurances that all is well. He said: 'Putin is toughing this out in his public presentation. You would expect him to do that. It's the kind of person he is. 'But we all know and Russians certainly know, thinking back to the days of the Soviet Union, that in the end the economic facts cannot be ignored. If your economy is cratering you cannot support the kind of foreign adventures Putin is undertaking, you cannot support the kind of security state structure that he has generated and that he needs to keep him there. 'So he will have to trim his behaviour to reflect the decline in the Russian economy and sanctions are a critical part of the pressure on him to change his behaviour.' The current negotiations are not about the annexation of Crimea, which Mr Hammond denounced as illegal, but he insisted Russia's withdrawal from it would be the next demand if the plan for eastern Ukraine is accepted by Mr Putin. He added: 'Don't make it sound like that is an outrageous thing for us to demand. 'This man has sent troops across an international border and occupied another country's territory in the 21st century acting like some mid-20th century tyrant. 'We do not behave like that. Civilised nations do not behave like that in the 21st century. We live in a rules-based society. We want the Russian people to be part of that international community. 'We want Russia to enjoy the kind of economic growth and rising standards of living that people in the rest of Europe enjoy and we do not see any reason to tolerate this kind of outrageous and outdated behaviour from the Kremlin.' Mr Hammond ruled out Britain arming the Ukrainian forces under threat from Russian aggression . Downing Street insists Britain is playing an 'active role' in Europe's response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, despite the fact that Mrs Merkel and Mr Hollande were spearheading the diplomatic effort to end the conflict. Mr Hammond ruled out Britain arming the Ukrainian forces under threat from Russian aggression . General Sir Richard Shirreff, Britain's former top Nato commander, said the UK should be playing a major role in the efforts to resolve the crisis amid fears that it could lead to an all-out European war. 'The UK is a major Nato member, it is a major EU member, it is a member of the UN Security Council, and it is unfortunate that the weight that the British Prime Minister could bring to efforts to resolve this crisis appear to be absent,' he said. Yesterday the president of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, said the appeasement of Hitler in 1938, which failed to avert war, should be a ‘lesson to all of us’. He added: ‘We know from history that appeasement will never satisfy those that are being appeased.’ US Senator John McCain reportedly invoked the ghost of Munich in 1938, saying: ‘History shows us that dictators will always take more if you let them. They will not be dissuaded from their brutal behaviour when you fly to meet them.’ Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the defence select committee, warned George Osborne against cutting defence spending below the Nato target of 2 per cent of GDP, claiming this would encourage further aggression by Moscow.","Russian President will pay a 'political and economic price', says Hammond .

"A Gold Coast woman who was left stressed when her bank balance mysteriously increased to almost $10 million has been told she won't have to pay back an additional overdraft debt of $7500 that was also added to her account. Sue Lamb, 49, from Labrador, was shocked when she used an ATM to withdraw $100 from her ANZ credit account on Saturday and the bank receipt said her available balance was $9,990,420.94. Ms Lamb said she called ANZ to inform them of the error but claims a customer service agent told her it was her money and there was nothing he could do. 'They've really caused grave stress for my family,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've seen stories around the world where people get in a lot of trouble for this.' ANZ removed the staggering balance from her account on Monday and eventually reassured her that she won't have to pay the thousands of dollars in bills, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. Scroll down for video . Sue Lamb, 49, from Labrador had almost $10 million mysteriously deposited into her bank account . Ms Lamb said the money had been added to the limit on her credit card – an account she didn't usually use to withdraw cash. 'I never use that credit card to withdraw cash ever,' she said. 'If I had never gotten money out I never would have known.' Ms Lamb said when she spoke to a customer service agent on Sunday he first insisted the money was hers, and then told her she would have to ring back during business hours on Monday if she had any concerns. 'I said ""It's not my money"" and he said ""But it's a compound of all your company's funds"", but I don't have a company, I'm a sole trader,' she said. 'This gentleman didn't seem too concerned, he was more concerned with telling me that they were my funds. Ms Lamb used a Bank of Queensland ATM to withdraw $100 from her ANZ bank account on Saturday and the bank receipt said her available balance was $9,990,420.94 . 'I'm just appalled that ANZ bank haven't contacted me, and I'm really concerned that people really need to check the credit limits on their account.' On Monday morning Ms Lamb still had not heard from the bank, and had checked her account again to find the $10 million was gone and she was listed as being $7500 in debt. 'It's just ridiculous, I mean they've put $10 million credit on my credit card,' she said. 'Now the fact is they've put me in debt $7500. It's someone's debt but it's not mine. 'This happened on Valentine's Day, so the CEO of ANZ must want to marry me. 'After all the stress you caused you need to give me roses, chocolates and a holiday.' Ms Lamb said she called ANZ to inform them of the error but claims the customer service agent told her it was her money and there was nothing he could do .

"High speed: Truck driver Christopher Charles Boyer, 47, was arrested this weekend after engaging police in a 34-mile chase . A tractor-trailer driver threw items from his cab at police — including socks, shoes and a small refrigerator — as he led them on a 34-mile chase in western Pennsylvania, authorities said Sunday. Police in Westmoreland County said a man called emergency dispatchers just before 2am Saturday and said he planned to wreck his truck. State troopers tried to stop the vehicle near Washington Township but the driver disregarded the emergency lights and sirens, and a pursuit began along Route 70 and later the Pennsylvania Turnpike, police said. 'During the pursuit, the driver threw numerous items at pursuing troopers from the cab' including a steel canister that struck a Greensburg state police unit and disabled it, police said. The driver also threw a mini refrigerator before the truck was stopped with spike strips shortly after 3am Saturday. The driver refused orders to leave the cab, police said, so troopers entered and used a stun gun to subdue him. He was taken to a hospital because officers believed he was under the influence of a controlled substance, namely Xanax, and for other injuries, police said. 'It should be noted that during the pursuit the operator threw his shoes and socks at troopers. When the windows were broken to make entry into the cab, the operator's feet were cut during his resistance to arrest,' police said. At the hospital, he was treated for cuts on his feet, and a blood sample was taken for testing. The driver, identified as Christopher Charles Boyer, 47, of Mifflintown, is charged with aggravated assault, fleeing or attempting to elude, reckless endangering, resisting arrest and other counts. Court documents indicate he had requested representation by the public defender's office, which rang unanswered Sunday. State police told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that Boyer was the only occupant of the truck, which hauls sand used in the hydraulic fracturing drilling process, known as fracking. Police did not disclose his employer.","Tractor-trailer driver Christopher Charles Boyer, 47, called 911 early Saturday morning saying he was going to wreck his vehicle .

"This is the incredible moment an unborn baby gave his parents a 'thumbs up' from the womb during a routine 20-week scan. Paul Schofield, 31, and Cheryl Stevenson, 32, from Tameside, Greater Manchester, were left in fits of giggles after their healthy unborn son presented them with the hand gesture. Nurses carrying out the ultrasound at Saint Mary's Hospital in Manchester told the couple they had never seen such a clear signal during a scan before. Paul Schofield, 31, and Cheryl Stevenson, 32, from Tameside, Greater Manchester, were left in fits of giggles after their unborn son presented them with the 'thumbs up' hand gesture (pictured) during a routine scan . The couple, who have been together for five years and already have an 18-month-old son called Cameron (together above), thanked hospital staff for managing to capture the unique scan photo at just the right time . As well as receiving the unexpected stamp of approval from their unborn baby, the couple also discovered the sex of their child – and were delighted to be told they were having a boy. The pair, who have been together for five years and already have an 18-month-old son called Cameron, thanked staff for managing to capture the photo at exactly the right time. Mr Schofield, a manager at a conservatory company, said: 'It was all so clear. The midwife spent 15 minutes with Cheryl and the scan was very comprehensive. They check for an awful lot of things and you get 360 degree images. 'He was moving back and forth a lot and when it came to the end of the scan, they asked us if we wanted to know the sex, which we did. Then they asked us if we wanted some pictures. 'He immediately curled up into a ball and put his face down and at first we couldn't get a clear picture. We were gutted. But as soon as the midwife said she would have to wrap things up, his little hand came out and he gave us the thumbs up. 'We all burst into laughter. The midwife said she had seen a few hand gestures in her time but nothing as clear and forthright as this. It brought a great deal of happiness to our day.' He added: 'It was a unique experience that we wanted to share - and it was a great way of him telling us that we are doing a good job by him so far.' As well as receiving the unexpected seal of approval from their unborn baby, the couple also discovered the sex of their child –  a boy. They said after the 20-week scan: 'It brought a great deal of happiness to our day' Ms Stevenson, who admitted the couple have not yet chosen a name for the newborn, said the baby was moving around constantly during the scan. She said: 'It was really surprising. People have asked me if it is real. 'It's a prized memento and he must be having fun in there to be giving us the thumbs up.' It is not the first time unborn babies have been captured on camera having fun in the womb. Leo David Hargreaves, who was born last year, was snapped smiling in a 4D scan image revealed by his proud parents Leighton Hargreaves and Amy Cregg, from Accrington. And John and Charlotte Steel, from Stockport, revealed a scan which appeared to show their unborn son laughing and rocking back and forth.","Unborn baby gives 'thumbs up' gesture from womb during ultrasound scan .

"For one soap fan a simple souvenir T-shirt wasn't enough when it comes to expressing her devotion to her favourite programme. Lindsay Pearce, from Calgary, Canada, is such a huge fan of the long running ITV soap Coronation Street that she has characters from the show permanently inked on to her leg. Her elaborate Weatherfield-themed tattoos include portraits of Corrie's stars including Hayley Cropper, Rita Sullivan  and Norris Cole. Steve Pearce has spent months tattooing characters from Coronation Street such as Hayley Cropper (left) and Norris Cole (right) on to his wife Lindsay's leg . And luckily for Lindsay she has one very helpful connection which means her inkings aren't too pricey in the form of her tattoo artist husband Steve Pearce. Together the devoted pair have spent hours creating the skin-based tribute to their favourite Mancunian show. Steve, who runs his own tattoo studio in Calgary, has painstakingly etched images of characters in the soap onto his wife Lindsay's leg. The couple, who say their shared love of Weatherfield helps keep their marriage together, took on the project ahead of a visit to Manchester this year. They will be finishing the body art masterpiece in front of an audience at the Tattoo Tea Party, held at Event City near the Trafford Centre over three days from February 28 to March 1. The husband and wife also plan to fit in a visit to the Coronation Street Tour while they are in town. Lindsay and Steve (pictured) plan to finish their masterpiece at a tattoo show in Manchester . The Corrie montage on Lindsay's thigh includes Roy and Hayley Cropper around the hip, a smiling Betty Williams is at mid-thigh, while Rita Fairclough is inked above the knee . Steve, whose tattoo studio is called Immaculate Concept, says that the most difficult part of the process was settling on a Corrie character to ink. 'We thought is would be a cool idea to do a Coronation Street tattoo before we left and maybe finish it at the show. 'The hard part was narrowing down the characters we wanted to use causing the piece to keep getting larger and larger.' Despite all of their hard work on the project Steve said that they haven't quite finished their tribute but plan to work on it more once in Manchester. 'We have fit as many classic characters as we could but may add some more in the future. 'We got close to finishing the piece but will definitely work on it at the show and once we get back home. 'We look forward to returning to the Manchester Tea Party in 2016 with a fully complete Coronation Street tattoo with background images and maybe a few new additions.' Wife Lindsay says that no matter how hectic their lives become they always make time for their favourite show. 'We both lead pretty busy lives running a couple of businesses but we always manage to meet up at the end of a busy day to watch Corrie.' Steve tattooed all their favourite Corrie characters on his wife Lindsay's leg in time for a tattoo show .","Lindsay and Steve Pierce, from Canada, spent hours creating ink tribute .

"Apple has made a U-turn in its app review strategy after reversing an earlier decision to ban MassRoots. The social app allows its members to speak with other cannabis users and discover new marijuana strains and trends. It was removed from the App Store late last year because Apple said it promotes illegal substances online. Apple has made a U-turn in its app strategy after reversing an earlier decision to ban MassRoots. The social app allows its members to speak with other cannabis users and discover new marijuana strains and trends . According to App Store guideline 2.18: ‘Apps that encourage excessive consumption of alcohol or illegal substances, or encourage minors to consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes, will be rejected.’ MassRoots has now announced that Apple has agreed to allow the app back in the store just three months after the ban was enforced. However, the app is now restricted to users located in one of the 23 states where medical or recreational marijuana is legal. To enforce this, Apple phones will conduct an automatic geo-location before allowing users to down the app. MassRoots recently announced that Apple has agreed to allow the app back in the store just three months after the ban was enforced. The group had campaigned to get the app reinstated . The company added in a blog post that it intends to implement more checks to ensure it complies with the rule.‘We do not take this task lightly,’ it wrote.  ‘Over the coming weeks, we will be implementing new features to strengthen our compliance even beyond what is currently required’ MacRumors noted that it was possible to get around the geo-restrictions by signing up for a MassRoots account through the website before logging into the app. But MassRoots founder Isaac Dietrich said the Colorado-based private site was working to close the loophole. The company added in a blog post that it intends to implement more checks to ensure it complies with the rule. ‘We do not take this task lightly,’ it wrote. ‘Over the coming weeks, we will be implementing new features to strengthen our compliance even beyond what is currently required.’ MassRoots is available on the App Store for free, and has been updated to version 3.0. The states in which marijuana is legal in some form include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington. Tweets often reveal growing trends among young people - and now scientists have revealed cannabis has become a popular topic. During a single month, researchers identified more than seven million tweets referring to marijuana, with 'pro-pot' messages outnumbering those opposed to the drug by 15 to one. Most of those sending and receiving 'pot tweets' were under the age of 25, and many in their teens, said the team. US psychiatrist and lead author Dr Patricia Cavazos-Rehg, from the Washington University Institute for Public Health, said: 'It's a concern because frequent marijuana use can affect brain structures and interfere with cognitive function, emotional development and academic performance. 'The younger people are when they begin using marijuana, the more likely they are to become dependent. 'A lot of young people will phase out of marijuana use as they get older, but unfortunately, we're not good at predicting who those individuals are.' The findings, reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health, follow a computer search of tweets conducted between February 5 and March five last year.","Colorado-based app allows members to speak with other cannabis users .

"Drinking one can of a sugary drink a day increases the risk of dying from heart disease by a third, health campaigners warn. Heart health experts have launched a hard-hitting poster campaign to challenge the damage they claim is caused by the likes of Coca-Cola and Pepsi. One poster highlights the risk of heart disease, while a second warns that drinking one can of full sugar fizzy drink a day could lead to weight gain of 6kg – over a stone – in a year. Danger: Sugar has been labelled the ‘new tobacco’ by some health experts, who warn it is fuelling a national obesity epidemic, particularly among children . The campaign called GULP – Give Up Loving Pop – has been created by the Health Equalities Group, based in Liverpool, which is supported by the NHS and local authorities. GULP also highlights links between the drinks and tooth decay and type 2 diabetes. Sugar has been labelled the ‘new tobacco’ by some health experts, who warn it is fuelling a national obesity epidemic, particularly among children. A number of campaigning organisations are supporting the idea of a tax on sugary drinks both to reduce consumption and raise money to support health and sports schemes for youngsters. Recent research by the University of Liverpool claimed that added a 20p tax to the drinks would save thousands of children from diabetes, cancer and heart disease. They argued such a levy would prevent 1,100 cases of cancer in London alone, as well as reducing the number of people who develop diabetes by 6,300 and cut the number of people suffering from coronary heart disease or strokes by 4,300. Based on these figures, it seems tens of thousands of cases of disease could be prevented if the 20p per litre tax was adopted across the entire UK. Over 60 organisations - including Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, British Dietetic Association, CitizensUK, Faculty of Public Health, Netmums and Unison - have already backed the campaign for a sugary drinks tax. The new campaign warns that drinking one can of full-sugar fizzy drink a day could lead to weight gain of 6kg – over a stone – in a year . Supporters also include Rosie Boycott, who was appointed by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, to run the London Food Board. Soft drinks are the largest single source of sugar for children aged 4-10 years and teenagers. A tax of 20p a litre would add around 7p to the price of a standard can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Director of the GULP campaign, Robin Ireland, said: ‘Few people fully realise the harm that sugary drinks can do to your health. ‘As well as damaging your teeth, overconsumption of these drinks can lead to weight gain, type 2 diabetes and poor heart health. ‘Given the levels of overweight and obesity across the UK, in particular amongst youngsters, unless we start to take action on sugary drinks we will be storing up problems for future generations. ‘As sugary drinks manufacturers seem less-than-willing to inform the public about the health harms associated with overconsumption of their products we’ve launched our Gulp campaign to get the message across and take the fight to the manufacturers.’ He added: ‘With 40per cent of young people reportedly drinking three or more glasses of sugary drinks per day it is vital that we a send a message to Government about the damage that is being done to the health of our children and young people and the need for education on healthier alternatives.’ However, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, Gavin Partington, accused the campaign of 'scaremongering.' He said: ‘If these campaigners were genuinely interested in public health they would be seeking to educate all consumers about the importance of a balanced diet and physical exercise rather than erroneously targeting one product category and making claims not supported by the evidence.’","New campaign challenges 'damage' caused by Coca-Cola and Pepsi .

"Tory Cabinet ministers are split over whether the party should pledge to limit child benefit to the first two children, it emerged last night. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith gave his public backing to the idea yesterday, saying it would encourage ‘responsibility’ by parents. Mr Duncan Smith, a long-time enthusiast for the plan, has drawn up private costings suggesting the move could cut £2 billion a year off the benefits bill if it is applied to all future families. Scroll down for video . Backs the bill: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith gave his public backing to the idea of limiting child benefit to the first two children . He has spent months behind the scenes pushing for the policy to be included in the Conservative Party manifesto, arguing it could play a major role in meeting a commitment to cut the benefits bill by £12 billion. But other ministers are nervous that the move could alienate working families on low incomes – and draw unflattering comparisons with China’s controversial ‘one child policy’. A Tory source said the Chancellor George Osborne is among those who are ‘worried about the politics’ of the plan. Mr Duncan Smith yesterday suggested the policy could be limited to families on benefits – reducing the potential controversy, but also slashing the amount it would save. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘This is not a policy of the present government - if we do go down that road we will announce that. Pledge: Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show 'this is not about trying to penalise people' 'All I would say is this - people out there who are working, they make decisions about the size of their house, about how many children they have in accordance with what they can afford, we all do that, that’s how we work. ‘We haven’t made any announcement. All I’m saying to you is the principle that lies behind all these changes is this - you want people who are on benefit to take as much responsibility for their lives as people who are in work, that way it’s easier for them when they go to work to deal with their bills and their debts, etc. This is not about trying to penalise people.’ Large existing families would not be penalised by the Tory proposals, as they would only apply to children born in the future. The cap would mean that a family having more than two children would lose almost £700 per child per year. Against idea: Tory ministers originally considered capping child benefit at two children in 2012. But the plan was vetoed by Nick Clegg . Those pushed over the limit by multiple births would be exempt. The plan would also not affect those earning more than £50,000 a year, who have already had their child benefit cut. Downing Street declined to comment on the issue last night, saying it was ‘not policy at the moment’. Senior Tories are still debating whether new curbs on child benefit should be included in the manifesto – and whether they should apply only to those on benefits. Tory ministers originally considered capping child benefit at two children in 2012. But the plan was vetoed by Nick Clegg. Nadhim Zahawi, a member of the Number 10 policy board, was slapped down by Mr Cameron the following year for reviving the plan and suggesting it should be applied to all families, including those not on benefits. But the need to find £12billion savings from the benefits bill has led to a reappraisal of the scheme. One Tory enthusiast for the idea, said: ‘This is an idea that saves a lot of money – something like £2billion a year. 'And it’s a good one because it’s not about squeezing or freezing existing benefits. Instead, it’s a principle-based policy that just says we should all face the same choices about how many children we can afford to support. ‘People can’t expect the taxpayer to fund lifestyle choices they can’t afford.’ The idea of capping child benefit payments has been condemned by anti-poverty charities. Oxfam UK has warned it would have a ‘devastating effect on those already struggling to make ends meet’.","Tory ministers are split over limiting child benefit to the first two children .

"A senior Tory has attacked David Cameron's 'illegal and unworkable' plan to force fat people to go on a diet or lose their benefits. Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the influential Commons Health Committee, said she was 'infuriated' by the proposal, announced last week. She has written to the Prime Minister to demand he drops the controversial plan. David Cameron has been criticised by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston over his plan to cut benefits for people too fat to go to work if they don't go on a diet . Dr Wollaston said Mr Cameron was effectively asking doctors and nurses to break the law, because all patients had the right to refuse treatment. She said threatening to take away people's basic income meant the government was forcing people to get help. At the moment there is no requirement on addicts to seek help before they claim sickness benefits. Cameron has launched a review to see if he can change the rules. But Mr Cameron said people who cannot work because they are too fat – or addicted to drugs or alcohol – should have their benefits cut if they refuse to get treatment. He pointed to Government figures which show 100,000 people claim benefits for 'treatable conditions'. Less than 2,000 are on benefits because they are too fat to work. But Dr Wollaston, a former GP, said: 'A doctor would not only find themselves in breach of the law, they'd find themselves at risk of being struck off. So in fact, his proposal is utterly unworkable in terms of the existing law.' Government figures show 100,000 people claim benefits for 'treatable conditions' - including around 2,000 who are  too fat to work . The MP for Totnes told BuzzFeed News that she was 'infuriated' by the proposal which she suggested was a dog whistle to right wing voters who think everyone on benefits is lazy. She said: 'It's really unnecessary and it's all part of, in my view, trying to appeal to a sort of particular group of people who see that everybody on benefits is somehow there because it's their own fault. We shouldn't go down this route. 'We need to have a compassionate Conservative message, in my view, and this isn't a compassionate Conservative message – this is frankly illegal and unworkable.' Dr Wollaston said the proposal was 'indefensible'. Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, has defended the proposal . She called on Number 10 to issue an urgent clarification that 'there will be no enforced referrals' of obese patients for treatment. The MP added: 'If you say to somebody: 'We will remove everything you have to live on unless you go to this thing', all you'll have is people pitching up just to tick the box, they won't engage with treatment so it won't work, and it would count under the law as an enforced referral and it would be illegal. So I can't stress this enough, they need to withdraw it and they should do it immediately.' On Saturday, Mr Cameron defended the plan. He said: 'People have problems with their weight that could be addressed, but instead a life on benefits rather than work becomes the choice. 'It is not fair to ask hard-working taxpayers to fund the benefits of people who refuse to accept the support and treatment that could help them get back to a life of work.' Number 10 made it clear the benefit cuts, worth about £100 a week, were a personal priority of the Prime Minister. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has insisted the policy does not mean taking away people's benefits if they cannot lose weight. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, he said: 'The problem we've got is that lots of people are either fearful or don't want to take the help that's there. 'We invest in the help, whether it's to support people to get off drugs . . . or whether it's to get people into a particular mindset to reduce their weight because their health condition's so bad. 'What we want is people to take that help and to take responsibility for their condition and try to improve. No one's going to penalise anybody who tries.'","Sarah Wollaston said she was 'infuriated' by the Prime Minister's proposal .

"A mother has a rare brain disorder which she claims causes her to take off her clothes in public – and says the condition is 'ruining her life'. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day, each lasting up to half an hour. She blacks out during the fits - which have a strange and embarrassing side-effect - they often cause her to strip down to her underwear. They also sometimes leave her incontinent, meaning she is at risk of wetting herself publicly. Mrs Lyon says while the condition may seem amusing to onlookers, it is highly debilitating as she cannot hold down a job and struggles to raise her two young children. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small, non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day. These episodes can cause her to strip off in public, she claims . Mrs Lyon has a hypothalamic hamartoma, which is thought to affect only one in a million people. She says the condition is 'ruining her life' as she hates having seizures in front of her children: Megan, 6 (left) and Kieran, 9 (right) and feels as though she can't always look after them properly . She relies on a carer to take her two children Kieran, nine, and Megan, six, to school and is heavily dependent on her husband David, 43, a shoe salesman. Mrs Lyon, of Northampton, said she doesn't strip every time she has a seizure, but it does happen around twice a month. She said: 'I have no idea what I'm doing during the fits - it's almost like I'm sleep-walking and it's led to some really embarrassing episodes. 'Once, I was shopping in Wilkinsons when I suffered a seizure and I began stripping in the aisles. When I came round, I was in nothing but my underwear.' She added: 'Because I black out during the seizures I can never remember what happened - I simply come round with no clothes on. 'I'm sure it might look funny to some strangers but the condition is ruining my life. 'The same thing happened at a taxi rank. 'It's mortifying and frankly I'm amazed nobody has called the police to report me for indecent exposure.' Mrs Lyon has had seizures since she was four years old. Medics were baffled by her condition until she was diagnosed with hypothalamic hamartoma at the age of 29. The condition is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, blackouts and memory loss. It is thought to affect only one individual in every one million people. At 17, she had surgery to remove part of her brain and rid her of the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse. Now Mrs Lyon has five or more episodes a day. While some last for a few seconds, others can go on for half an hour. When she was 17, Mrs Lyons had a part of her brain removed in order to remove the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse . Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, behavioural problems, blackouts and memory loss. The condition is thought to affect only one  in a million people. HH is often difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat. Some individuals can go years with very few symptoms, or ones that are so mild, they are often missed by both parents and medical professionals. However, for most people with HH, the most common symptoms are frequent daily 'gelastic' seizures (seizures which involve spontaneous laughing, giggling or smirking) or 'dacrystic' seizures (which involve crying or grunting). People with HH report behavioural difficulties, and some have been diagnosed with attention deficit behavior (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder, depression, paranoid disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some  have significant difficulties controlling angry outbursts, aggressive tendencies and many have been described as having oppositional-defiant disorder. These angry outbursts are often referred to as hypothalamic rages. What makes the actions different from a genuine angry ouburst is that the person typically does not make eye contact or the eyes seem vacant, they initially may not be able to hear any commands and they often require time and space to calm down. Sometimes they have no memory of the rage once it is over. These symptoms often start early in life – for some, they become apparent shortly after birth, but are frequently misdiagnosed. They are most commonly treated by surgery or anti-epileptic medicine. Source: Hope for HH . Mrs Lyon said: 'It's terrifying - not to mention dangerous - living like this. 'Once, I got onto a bus during a blackout and when I came round I had no idea where I was. 'I also am often incontinent when I have my seizures, which is excruciating. I had to wear adult nappies for a while. 'I can't go out for a night out with friends because I'm terrified I might have an episode. 'It would be really embarrassing to have to go home early because I wet myself or started stripping at the bar.' Mrs Lyon also suffers from embarrassing episodes at home. She said: 'A few months ago I was folding my kids' washing when I had one of my episodes. 'I don't know what I did while I was having my fit but when I came around I had one leg in a pair of my eight-year-old daughter's knickers. 'I frequently walk from room to room in nothing but my underwear with no idea what's going on.' She added: 'My children are more like carers than carefree kids - they've had to grow up so quickly. 'When I start having a fit I usually start laughing. 'When my son sees me laughing he says ""Mummy's having one of her turns,"" and he records it on his phone so I can see what happened. 'It is horrible to watch, you can see I'm not quite right. 'I hate to think that my kids have to watch their mother having seizures multiple times a day. 'My devoted husband is incredibly understanding but my condition puts a constant strain on our marriage. 'To him, it must be like living with three children. 'I don't feel like a normal wife or mother. I need help with the school run because I can't be trusted with the kids alone.' Because of the debilitating condition, Mrs Lyon also struggles to hold down a job. The seizures often leave Mrs Lyon incontinent, and she says they are dangerous. Once she had a seizure and got onto a bus and when she 'woke up' she had no idea where she was. She is pictured undergoing tests in hospital with Vivian Gattoc, who founded the Hope for Hypothalamic Hamartoma charity . She says the condition means her children  are 'more like carers than carefree kids'. She said: 'I don't feel like a normal wife or mother. I need help with the school run because I can't be trusted with the kids alone.' She is pictured with daughter Megan, 6, (left) and son Kieran, 9, (right) For a brief period she was employed at a supermarket but left after one of her episodes. She said: 'I have no idea what happened but I could tell my colleagues were scared by me afterwards.' Mrs Lyon's rare condition can be treated using keyhole surgery to destroy the tumor. But the procedure is currently only available in the United States and costs £95,000. Mrs Lyon said: 'I'm desperate to find a way to beat this tumour. 'It would mean the world to me if I could just take my kids to the park without needing constant supervision. 'I'm trying to raise money for the expensive procedure in America – one day, I'll beat this and be seizure free.'

"A teenage scrounger due to appear in a new benefits programme hopes the experience will catapult him to celebrity status, with a new set of teeth thrown in for free along the way. Travis Simpkins from Sheffield is among a handful of people who will feature on Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole, a Channel 5 documentary starting tonight. The 17-year-old, who says his only job is 'to be me', claims employment allowance after being diagnosed with ADHD. Scroll down for video . Travis Simpkins will appear in Benefits Britain: Life on The Dole on Channel 5 tonight. The 18-year-old has hopes of becoming a reality TV star and being given new teeth on the NHS . On the road to stardom? The teenager hopes his appearance on the reality TV show will buy him a new set of teeth . He hopes the programme, inspired by Channel 4's popular Benefits Street, will bring him the acclaim he needs to launch a career in showbiz. 'I'm hoping to come off benefits in three months, I want to go into a TV career,' he said.. 'I want to become a reality star and I'm hoping to apply for Big Brother's summer show. I just love cameras and love television.' The only thing holding him back from fame and fortune are his teeth, which he hopes will  be corrected by the taxpayer one way or another. And if the NHS rejects his request, the teenager plans to set up an online donations page to pay for the dentistry. 'I want to put up a website like fixmyteeth.com or something and ask people to help fix my teeth, to raise the money, then I’ll pay the rest. 'No one has ever done that before.' Critics have hit out at the teenager's plans saying he should focus more on work and less on vanity. 'It's important we don't glamourise the benefits system,' Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance said. 'Life is hard for those out of work, and that's why it's important the Government does everything it can to get people into employment - not just for taxpayers who may have to pick up the bill, but for the individuals concerned. 'Taxpayers will hope this young man is devoting as much time to looking for work as he is to his appearance.' Travis appears on the reality show with his friend, Stephanie Cocker, a 25-year-old single mother-of-two. Miss Cocker does not work because, with childcare so expensive, she says she would not have enough money left from a wage at the end of the month. The teenager (pictured on screen with friend Stephanie Cocker) claims employment support allowance after being diagnosed with ADHD . Travis hopes he will be selected to appear on reality TV shows in the future, like Benefits Street's White Dee (right) who starred in Celebrity Big Brother after sharing details of her life claiming from the state . White Dee, real name Deirdre Kelly, was the stand-out star of Channel 4's controversial series Benefits Street. She and her neighbours on James Turner Street in Birmingham became the most prolific benefits scroungers in the country in the show's wake. But the stardom afforded to her by the show's popularity brought with it a wave of opportunities. Namely expensive appearances at parties in Magaluf where the mother-of-two was seen swigging champagne and topping up her tan. And a stint on Celebrity Big Brother followed before Dee shifted her focus to politics. She appeared at a fringe meeting at the Conservative Party Conference and features on debate panels regularly to discuss Britain's welfare system. Dee no longer claims benefits, and while she says she is disappointed to have been cast in a negative light by producers of the show, she is grateful to be able to provide her children with more. White Dee shot to stardom after appearing in the Channel 4 show filmed on James Turner Street. Above, she is pictured speaking at a fringe meeting at the Conservative Party Conference . Instead she chooses to stay at home with her children and claim benefits. Travis has a more simple explanation - he doesn't see himself in an office job or working behind a bar. 'I'm just me. That's my job. I want to entertain people. 'I had a part time job as a valet when I was 16 for four weeks and I got £25-a-day. I don't feel like I could do a job sitting in an office or in a shop or behind a bar or in a call centre or at a butcher's. 'I don't think I could do it.' And while he admits that 'everybody is entitled to their opinion', the teen would rather see some 'keep theirs to themselves'. Miss Cocker is more apprehensive about criticism, claiming the programme 'edits it to make you look bad.' 'There was no mention of all the work I've done,' she said, referencing her stint as a nightclub bouncer which ended when she fell pregnant. 'I can't go back to night work because I can't get child minders overnight. They never put anything in about that,' the 25-year-old bemoaned. Keen to turn her life around, Miss Cocker is on the lookout for new opportunities to become a social worker. 'I want to go back to college, I want qualifications, I want to go and get GCSEs. At the moment I’m looking for education and then I want to be a youth worker.'","Travis Simpkins is due to appear on Benefits Britain: Life on The Dole .

"A Gold Coast woman says she was left stressed after her bank balance was mysteriously increased to almost $10 million. Sue Lamb, 49, from Labrador, was shocked when she used an ATM to withdraw $100 from her ANZ credit account on Saturday and the bank receipt said her available balance was $9,990,420.94. Ms Lamb said she called ANZ to inform them of the error but claims a customer service agent told her it was her money and there was nothing he could do.

Sue Lamb, 49, from Labrador had almost $10 million mysteriously deposited into her bank account . 'I've seen stories around the world where people get in a lot of trouble for this.' Ms Lamb said the money had been added to the limit on her credit card – an account she didn't usually use to withdraw cash. 'I never use that credit card to withdraw cash ever,' she said. 'If I had never gotten money out I never would have known.' Ms Lamb said when she spoke to a customer service agent on Sunday he first insisted the money was hers, and then told her she would have to ring back during business hours on Monday if she had any concerns. 'I said ""It's not my money"" and he said ""But it's a compound of all your company's funds"", but I don't have a company, I'm a sole trader,' she said. 'This gentleman didn't seem too concerned, he was more concerned with telling me that they were my funds. Ms Lamb used a Bank of Queensland ATM to withdraw $100 from her ANZ bank account on Saturday and the bank receipt said her available balance was $9,990,420.94 . 'I'm just appalled that ANZ bank haven't contacted me, and I'm really concerned that people really need to check the credit limits on their account.' On Monday morning Ms Lamb still had not heard from the bank, and had checked her account again to find the $10 million was gone and she was listed as being $7500 in debt. 'It's just ridiculous, I mean they've put $10 million credit on my credit card,' she said. 'Now the fact is they've put me in debt $7500. It's someone's debt but it's not mine. 'This happened on Valentine's Day, so the CEO of ANZ must want to marry me. 'After all the stress you caused you need to give me roses, chocolates and a holiday.' Ms Lamb said she called ANZ to inform them of the error but claims the customer service agent told her it was her money and there was nothing he could do . An ANZ spokeswoman said Ms Lamb had chosen to have an 'unlimited monthly spend cap' on her account. 'The available balance on the BOQ ATM receipt refers to the amount of the monthly spend cap rather than the available credit,' she said. 'We're investigating why the BOQ’s receipt is showing the monthly spend cap rather than the actual balance. 'We would like to apologise to Ms Lamb for any inconvenience and we will be contacting her today.'

"Nearly 95 percent of fruits and vegetables imported to Australia are not tested for diseases before they are sold on the supermarket shelf. Experts warn growers in foreign countries are not subjected to the same levels of hygiene as Australian farmers, which puts people at greater risk of infection, the Daily Telegraph reports. It comes after nine people in various states contracted hepatitis A from consuming packaged frozen berries sold in the supermarket. Scroll down for video . Nearly 95 percent of fruits and vegetables imported to Australia are not tested for diseases before they are sold on the supermarket shelf . 'A lot of the countries where we are ­importing food have waterways that are contaminated with sewage,' Professor Peter Collignon, infectious diseases expert from the Australian National University said. 'They are not operating at the same standards as we have here. You don't want to have food that has been contaminated with human waste.' High risk foods that are imported to Australia are currently tested but all other foods are categorised as 'surveillance foods', according to a Department of Agriculture spokesman. Of these surveillance foods, which includes frozen berries, only five percent is tested for diseases. The peak body of vegetable farmers say this standard was putting Australians at risk. It comes after Patties Foods recalled 1kg packets of Nanna's Mixed Berries and the 300g and 500g varieties of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries at the weekend due to people contracting hepatitis A . Experts warn growers in foreign countries are not subjected to the same levels of hygiene as Australian farmers, which puts people at greater risk of infection . 'It is of great concern because our growers are being disadvantaged by cheap imports... potentially putting consumers at risk,' Andrew White, AUSVEG deputy CEO, said. Foods that did fail safety testing last year include cooked prawns from Vietnam (standard plate count), chilli powder from South Africa (salmonella) and Serrano ham from Spain (e.coli), according to the Daily Telegraph. Patties Foods recalled 1kg packets of Nanna's Mixed Berries and the 300g and 500g varieties of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries at the weekend. The products were pulled off the shelf after three adults in Victoria, two in NSW and four in Queensland contracted hepatitis A from reportedly eating the berries. The products were pulled off the shelf after three adults in Victoria, two in NSW and four in Queensland contracted hepatitis A from reportedly eating the berries . The berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores, are packed in China and distributed in Australia by Patties Foods, based in Bairnsdale in southeast Victoria. Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, is awaiting test results to see if she contracted hepatitis A after using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies until Sunday. 'I'm really angry... (and) it's absolutely terrified me,' Ms Sims told Daily Mail Australia. Doctors say Ms Sims is exhibiting common symptoms of the disease and expect to formally diagnose her with the virus when her results come back on Tuesday morning. 'Over the last two to three weeks I've been getting quite sick and I just thought it was a flu,' Ms Sims said. Just five per cent of imported food is checked when it gets to Australia - if it fails every item is tested. Roasted peanuts from China detected Aflatoxin last year . Chilli powder from South Africa was found to have traces salmonella . Serrano ham from Spain had traces of e.coli when it was tested in Australia last year . 'Last night I just couldn't really swallow anymore and I was going to make a frozen drink like I have been for the last four to six weeks.' After her partner Trevor alerted her to the health warning  he rushed her to hospital. Since her admission her eyelids have turned yellow and she is exhibiting signs of jaundice. Ms Sims is also suffering from chronic tonsillitis and a chest infection - likely a result of her body fighting multiple infections. 'I'm massively jaundice and my liver's pretty crappy and these are the first signs of hep A from the berries,' Ms Sims said. Though still awaiting the definitive results of her blood tests, Ms Sims said her doctor was almost certain she had hepatitis A. Ms Sims said she felt betrayed by the food company and claims she was misled over the origin of the product which she thought were Australian made. Patties Foods CEO Steven Chaur said the wider recall was a precautionary measure until the results of further laboratory testing came back. Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, is awaiting test results to see if she contracted hepatitis A after using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies until Sunday . She is suffering from jaundice, evident on her eyelids, and doctors expect to formally diagnose her with hepatitis A when her blood test results return . 'We have decided that all our frozen Mixed Berries should be recalled until such time as we receive the results of further laboratory tests,' Mr Chaur said. 'The recall is an important step to ensure public safety and confidence.' The health department has also told the company to recall the product that contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, said frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past. 'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday. 'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.' Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch director Dr Vicky Shepherd said an investigation by all health agencies would help determine how many people have been affected - although some may not be struck down with the infection for a few weeks. Symptoms of Hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea and fever as well as yellow skin and eyes. Concerned consumers can call Patties Foods on 1800 650 069.

"An eight-month-old baby suffocated after she 'wriggled' down her parents' bed and became trapped between the mattress and the frame as her family held a party downstairs, an inquest heard. Halima Saida Ali was found unconscious by her mother Shaheen at the foot of the bed at the family home in Derby on August 25 last year. Although the little girl was taken to hospital and later transferred to a specialist unit, she died two weeks later at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. Eight-month-old Halima Saida Ali suffocated after wriggling down her parents' bed and becoming trapped in the frame as her family held a party downstairs at their home in this street in Derby, an inquest heard . A coroner has ruled that the baby's death was accidental after hearing police could find no evidence of neglect. The inquest into Halima's death, at Derby Coroner's Court was told that there was a party taking place at the Ali family home on the night she was taken to hospital, and that the baby had only been left for a short amount of time. Finding their baby, Mrs Ali and her husband Ashad, who works as an administrator, had called for an ambulance and, under the instructions of paramedics, the family had performed CPR on the child in an attempt to save her. When the ambulance arrived, Halima was taken to the Royal Derby Hospital, and was later  transferred to the intensive care ward at Queen's Medical Centre, where she died on September 7. Detective Inspector Tony Brittan, who attended the family home on the day Halima was taken to hospital, told the hearing he was content that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death. After being taken to the Royal Derby Hospital, Halima was later transferred to the intensive care unit of the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham (pictured), where she died on September 7 last year . He said the baby had appeared to have wriggled in her sleep before becoming stuck. 'Halima was found by her family with her head stuck under the footboard and her feet hanging down towards the floor,' the police officer said. 'There were no signs of trauma in the bedroom where she was found. 'The family had completed CPR on the directions of the ambulance service. 'There was no sign of any criminal negligence. It was a tragic accident.' Louise Pinder, assistant coroner for Derby, asked if there had been any chance of survival for the baby, despite the best efforts of the family and hospital staff to keep her alive. DI Brittan replied: 'There was a very weak pulse towards the end of her resuscitation. 'It was clear from the start she was not going to survive that particular incident.' A post mortem examination showed Halima died of a positional asphyxiation - meaning she had suffocated due to the position she had wriggled into. Miss Pinder said: 'Halima, a much loved and well cared-for eight-month-old baby girl, was found unresponsive, having only been left alone for a short period of time. 'It is likely she became trapped between the footboard and the mattress at the bottom of the bed. 'It was quickly established she had no chance of survival. She died on September 7 last year and she died as a result of accidental death.'","Halima Saida Ali found unconscious at family home in Derby last August .

"The 'biggest national security threat' to the U.S. at this juncture is not terrorists abroad, says former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, it's Congress. 'It's the total dysfunction in Washington. The fact that so little can be done by the Congress,' Panetta told CNN's Jim Acosta on Sunday during an appearance on State of the Union. Earlier in the broadcast Panetta, the Pentagon chief from 2011 to 2013, said ISIS 'truly represents kind of a whole new face in the war on terrorism' because the extremist group is well-funded, well-armed and 'has a strong command and control.' 'And as a result of that, I think that they can conduct the kind of offensive operations that can be very effective,' he said, and therefore they must 'be met tooth and nail with everything we've got.' The United States needs to bolster its strategy in confronting ISIS if it is going to achieve its mission of degrading and destroying the terror group, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said on Sunday . ISIS, Panetta told CNN's Jim Acosta, 'is a whole new chapter in terms of the terrorist threat to that area and to our country.' But the 'biggest' threat to U.S. national security is the dysfunction of Congress, he said . ISIS, he proclaimed, 'is a whole new chapter in terms of the terrorist threat to that area and to our country.' Panetta said President Barack Obama has the 'right pieces in place to try to confront ISIS' and noted that the U.S. and its partners have 'made some important gains' in stopping the territorial expansion of militants in Iraq. But even after prompting from fill-in host Acosta, Panetta would not say he agreed with Obama's claim last week that the United States' coalition 'is on the offensive' and ISIS 'is on the defensive.' The president's 'strategy has to be bolstered in a strong way,' he asserted. 'We've got to be able to ensure that we are committed every day of the week towards making sure that this strategy works, that we disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat ISIS.' Panetta acknowledged, as he did in his memoir, released in October of last year, that Obama and his administration bungled its response to the chaos in Syria and that the White House should have asked Congress for the authority to fight ISIS at least six months before it did. The U.S. has been carrying out airstrikes on ISIS in Iraq since August, Syria since September, but it did not make a formal request to Congress for power to go to war with the terrorist group and its affiliates until last week. The White House has been relying on a 9/11 era document for its authority to carry out military operations in the two countries. It last week asked Congress to tear up a 2001 Authorization of Military Force Agreement and replace it was an updated 'right-sized' resolution giving the president the ability to conduct an air and ground war against ISIS in any country it invades. Despite its close work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to come up with a draft that satisfied both political parties, legislators are dissatisfied with the president's request for varying reasons. They have suggested they would not support the proposed AUMF in its current form. In this photo taken last Wednesday, President Barack Obama (center) delivers a statement on the legislation he sent to Congress earlier in the day to authorize the use of military force (AUMF) against ISIS, while Vice President Joe Biden (left) and Secretary of State John Kerry (second right) and then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (right) listen. The following day Ash Carter was confirmed by the Senate as Pentagon head, replacing Hagel . Panetta lashed out at Congress on Sunday for Members' unwillingness to put aside their differences to pass legislation addressing key problems. They can't 'resolve the issue of homeland security. They can't deal with budgets. They can't deal with immigration reform. They can't deal with infrastructure. They can't deal with other issues,' he said, referencing a dispute over funding for Homeland Security that must end by Feb. 28 to avoid a partial shutdown of the department. 'If they wind up not being able to deal with this war authorization, that sends a terrible message to the world,' Panetta warned. The former Defense head and CIA director stressed that ISIS 'is not an enemy that you can kind of stand aside and not confront.' 'If we stand aside, if we don't get involved, if we don't provide leadership, unfortunately, nobody else will,' he claimed. 'That's why it's important for us to take a leadership position' in Iraq, Syria and 'elsewhere in confronting terrorism,' he said. Panetta said he had 'tremendous confidence' in newly confirmed Secretary of Defense Ash Carter's skill set and ability to steer the president toward victory in the country's battle against ISIS. 'He's very bright,' Panetta said. Noting that Carter served as his No. 2 at the Pentagon, Panetta said the new military chief knows the Department of Defense inside out. But 'in the end, it's the president who has to ultimately decide' whether to take the advice of his top military advisers, he said, or not.","'It's the total dysfunction in Washington.

"Journalist Caroline Clarke has known for most of her life that she was adopted, but it was not until she turned 37 and was searching for some medical history that she found out that her grandfather was the legendary signer and jazz pianist Nat King Cole. Clarke, a married mother of two who hosts the syndicated TV show Black Enterprise Business Report, made the shocking discovery in 2002. That same year, she reunited for the first time with her birth mother, Carole 'Cookie' Cole. Last year, Clarke published a book about her extraordinary family titled Postcards From Cookie: A Memoir of Motherhood, Miracles and a Whole Lot of Mail. Famous relative: At age 37, journalist Caroline Clarke (left) found out that her biological mother, Carole 'Cookie' Cole, was the eldest daughter of famous singer Nat King Cole (right) Reunited: In 2002, Clarke and Carole 'Cookie' Cole (right) met for the first time after being estranged for 37 years - from the day of Clarke's birth . Cole clan: Carol Cole, pictured far left as a child next to her sister Natalie and their parents, gave birth to a baby daughter in 1964. She was forced to put her up for adoption because she was conceived out of wedlock . For Clarke, it all started when a mystery pain in her joints forced her to reach out to a social worker in hopes of obtaining her birth mother's medical history. But the woman at Spence-Chaplin Adoption Services did one better and voluntarily  provided Clarke not only with her family's medical records, but also with a seven-page report detailing her mother’s personal history, down to her major in college. What the Ivy League-educated journalist learned was that she was born on Christmas Day in 1964 at Lenox Hill Hospital to an exceptionally wealthy and famous black family, but her 20-year-old mother was not allowed to raise her because Clarke was conceived out of wedlock, and the scandal could have damaged her grandfather's reputation, reported the New York Daily News back in April. Memoir: Caroline Clarke wrote a book about her incredible family in 2014, five years after the passing of her biological mother . By the time Clarke was born, Nat King Cole, her maternal grandfather, was one of the most celebrated entertainers in the country. The singer, his wife and their five children lived in a 20-room mansion in a tony part of Los Angeles where they hosted lavish parties for their famous friends. Born Nathaniel Adams Coles, Nat King Cole emerged in the post-World War II era as a trailblazing black performer, best known for such chart-topping hits as Mona Lisa and Unforgettable. He also held the distinction of being the first African-American man to host a show on NBC. That is why when the family learned that the singer's eldest unwed daughter, Carole, became pregnant, her mother made the decision to put the child up for adoption. Determined to keep her child, whom she named Gretchen, Carole Cole initially refused to sign the adoption papers, but she finally relented upon learning that her 45-year-old father was dying of lung cancer. ‘I lost my baby in December. I lost my father in February. I lost my soul,’ Carole Cole would write in her journal. Not long after, Robert and Vera Clarke, an African-American couple from The Bronx, adopted little Gretchen and renamed her Caroline. Her adoptive father was a college professor while her mother taught high school. Nat King Cole's music was ever present in the Clarkes' home on Wilson Avenue. By her own account, Caroline Clarke enjoyed a happy childhood marked by joyous celebrations and summers spent at her adoptive uncle's home in Long Island. It was during one of those family get-togethers that she met her future husband, John Graves, at the age of 7. Clarke went on to earn a Bachelor's degree from Smith College and a Master's degree from the prestigious Columbia University School of Journalism. In an unexpected twist of fate, during her time as an undergraduate student, Clarke met and became close friends with Timolin ‘Timmie’ Cole, one of Nat King Cole's younger children who had a twin sister, Casey. Keeping up appearances: Maria Cole (far right) insisted that Carole put her child up for adoption. The Clarke family, from The Bronx, New York, raised little Caroline as their own . Nat King Cole at play with his girls. Like Caroline, Carole was also adopted. When her mother, Maria Cole's sister, passed away, the family of the famous musician took the child in . Long-distance relationship: Caroline (center) and Cookie (right) spent seven years, until her mother's passing in 2009, exchanging postcards and phone calls . Over the course of their 20-year friendship, Clarke got to know the Cole family well and was told about Timmie Cole's much older sister, Carole, who was an actress in Hollywood, and who put up her baby for adoption. Carole Cole herself was adopted by Nat King Cole and his wife, Maria, after Maria's sister died in her youth. After learning the truth about her heritage, Caroline Clarke recalled how at age 17, she was invited to a sleepover at Maria Cole’s penthouse at the Ritz Carlton in Boston. That night, Nat King Cole’s imperious widow questioned Caroline about her date of birth, the hospital where she was born and the circumstances of her adoption. At the time, Caroline Clarke thought nothing of Maria Cole’s very personal line of questioning. It was not years later that the conversation came back to haunt her. In 2002, Caroline Clarke finally reached out to her birth mother after getting her phone number from her friend, Timmie, who was actually her aunt. The mother and daughter reunited later that year and kept in touch, mostly via postcards, for the next seven years, until Carole Cole passed away from cancer in 2009. Truth comes to light: Caroline Clarke, the host of the TV show Black Enterprise Business Report, reached out to a social worker in 2002 to obtain medical history, but she got so much more than that . Over the course of their relationship, Carole Clarke was shocked to learn that her biological father was a white Jewish man whom her mother met in college, and who knew nothing of her existence. Clarke, a strong, independent black woman who married into the family that owned Black Enterprise, initially struggled to accept that she was a person of mixed race. ‘I was raised black in a black family, very happily, proudly, adamantly black. And finding out that my birth father was white was jolting,’ she revealed to the site The Root. In the end, however, Clarke was glad to uncover her  family history, with all its dark secrets and unexpected twists and turns. ‘My feelings have evolved,' Clarke said in an interview with Smith College's news site. I accept that I am what I am genetically. Mixed-race is such a common reality now; the culture has evolved, which helps. But I still identify as African American.’","Journalist Caroline Clarke found out the truth about her birth family in 2002 when she went searching for medical history .

"At 40 weeks pregnant, a Florida mom had heard plenty of advice on how to induce labor - spicy food, laxatives, castor oil - but she chose a different route: dancing.

"A dog on death row will for the first time in history have its case heard in Australia’s highest court. Condemned Staffordshire terrier Izzy is set to be destroyed after she bit a woman in August 2012 after escaping from her owner Tania Isbester’s backyard in The Basin, east Melbourne, Victoria. The woman who Izzy bit suffered a 1.5cm to her finger on 4 August 2012, which is deemed as a ‘serious injury’ under the Domestic Animal Act in Victorian law, and Izzy was seized by the council in June 2013. Lawyers representing the dog at no cost to the client say the local council that is fighting for Izzy’s destruction in the High Court is wasting public money by perusing the case. City of Knox council has refused RSPCA South Australia’s offer to rehabilitate the pet and assume all liability for her at no extra cost from the time of collection. ‘The council is prepared to spend a six figure sum fighting to kill a dog when they might lose in the High Court,’ barrister Graeme Mcewen, founder of the Barristers Animal Welfare Panel told Daily Mail Australia. Condemned Staffordshire terrier Izzy is set to be destroyed but could be saved by a final High Court bid . ‘No dog should be allowed to be killed by a council expect by court order,’ Mr Mcewen argued. In normal circumstances Izzy’s case would never have made it to the High Court but her fate has taken an unusual twist due to the manner in which the local council made in administrative decision  for her to be put down. In September 2013, Izzy’s owner Ms Isbester pleaded guilty to charges of her dog causing ‘serious injury’ at Ringwood Magistrates Court but the local council, the City of Knox, did not apply for a destruction order on Izzy from the magistrate at that time. If they had applied for the order from the magistrate, the question of whether the penalty (death) was proportionate to the injury caused (a 1.5 centimetre cut) would have been raised on appeal to a judge at the county court. Instead, the council ruled that the dog should be destroyed during a council panel meeting. In a letter to the City of Knox council, the CEO of RSPCA SA Tim Vasudeva, wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome Izzy at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed. The letter, seen by Daily Mail Australia and written on September 9, 2014, said: . ‘As discussed late last week, I can confirm that RSPCA South Australia would be happy to transport the dog known as Izzy (owned by Tania Isbester) to our Lonsdale Animal Shelter here in Adelaide in order for her to undergo an extensive behavioural assessment under the guidance of our qualified behaviourists.’ ‘This would involve a wide variety of behavioural interactions and analysis both inside and outside kennels, in our indoor behavioural centre and our outdoor fenced enclosures. The purpose of this would be to determine, in as thorough a manner as possible, the rehabilitation prospects of this dog. ‘We are able to arrange collection and transport at no expense to Knox City Council. RSPCA South Australia are prepared to take Izzy into our care and custody and assume all liability for this dog from the time of collection.’ During the panel hearing, which took place on 30 September, 2013, at Knox Civil Centre, one of the people on the panel was the same council officer who brought the charges against Izzy’s owner Ms Isbester. The team of barristers fighting Izzy’s case from the Barristers Animal Welfare Panel, including Richard Kendall QC and Andrew Felkel, is now challenging the decision that the panel came to  based on administrative law grounds. ‘The council officer who brought the charges then sat as a member of the three person panel which decided to put the dog down,’ Mr Mcewen told Daily Mail Australia. ‘The question of law is whether a fair minded observer might think that the accuser sitting on a panel is a) a conflict of interest or b) with a disposition of pre judgement.’ Izzy has been living in a cage at the RSPCA centre in Victoria for almost 21 months while the legal battle has played out. Victoria’s highest court first upheld the decision to destroy her on September 10, 2014, but the barristers have now been granted Special Leave permission to appeal to the High Court of Australia. Mr Mcewen admitted: ‘It’s a bit of a story.’ ‘Only one in ten cases get through on special leave application.’ In a letter to the City of Knox council, the CEO of RSPCA SA Tim Vasudeva, wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome her at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed. But the council knocked back the offer. ‘Rather than accept the offer and bring the matter to an end - avoiding legal proceedings at cost and removing her from their municipal boundaries of City of Knox - and not leaving a family heartbroken… the City of Knox refuses and now they have got to fight in the high court,’ Mr Mcewen said. Izzy’s case will be heard in court in April. A dog on death row will for the first time in history have its case heard in the High Court of Australia .","The City of Knox council made an 'administrative decision' to kill Izzy .

"A Mercedes left unlocked abandoned in a multi-storey car park has been towed away after gathering dust for three years. The car has been sitting idly in the Broadway Plaza car park in Birmingham after being deserted by its owner. After repeated failed attempts to have it collected, parking company APCOA towed the vehicle away this week. A Mercedes left unlocked in a city centre car park in Birmingham has been removed after sitting idle for around three years . The tax disc on the car's blackened windscreen expired in July 2012. Authorities were unable to track down its owner after numerous attempts . With spaces in the city-centre costing £13-a-day, the Mercedes C Class racked up £14,000 in unpaid fine over three years. For years drivers skirted around the black car which was propped up by a safety barrier. While the owner was traced through a log book left inside, they did not respond to any of the parking company's numerous attempts to make contact. And with the vehicle never having been reported as stolen, missing or involved in a crime, West Midlands Police saw no need to intervene. Birmingham City Council shrugged off responsibility for case too, with privately-owned APCOA forced to call in a third party to have it removed. 'The car in question has been in situ for years,' an APCOA spokesman said. The company which owns the car park made numerous failed attempts to contact its owner over the years . It was taken away by a third party brought in by APCOA after West Midlands Police and Birmingham City Council failed to intervene . Such a long-term stay in the car park would have cost the owner £14,000 if they had returned to claim the car . 'The reason why the vehicle is effectively cordoned off is because one of the back wheels/axles is loose, and the car is propped up on one side for reasons of safety. 'West Midlands Police were made aware of the vehicle in the event that it may have been stolen. However, police records confirmed otherwise. 'The police recommended APCOA write to Birmingham City Council to request the removal of the abandoned vehicle.' While local authorities are at a loss as to where the car came from, other drivers at the car park offered up their own bizarre theories. 'What is it doing there? Why hasn’t it been moved? Is there a dead body in the trunk? Is it haunted? 'Thousands upon thousands of people must have driven past it over the years and thought similar things,' said one motorist.","The vehicle gathered dust in Birmingham car park for three years .
Its owner, who left it unlocked, has never responded to letters or fines .
West Midlands Police said the car had never been reported stolen .
Charges for the long-term stay would have been more than £14,000 .

"A vigilante speed campaigner has been sacked by police for catching 'too many motorists' after he trapped more than 40,000 drivers. David McCandless, 69, and his team of volunteers at Speed Watch caught around 1,600 speeding drivers every month in the Cambridgeshire towns of St Ives and Ramsey. The group use hand-held speed cameras by the side of the road and then pass on the information police, who can then issue a warning letter to offenders. David McCandless, 69, was sacked from volunteer role at Speed Watch after he caught 'too many motorists' But he claims his relationship with the force began to deteriorate when he was told he could only report less than 500 motorists a month. Police told him staff could only process 2,000 cases across the whole country, so he would have to let some drivers off. But the decision led to increasing tensions between the two parties before the former RAF engineer was dismissed by the force. Mr McCandless, from St Ives, said: 'The police believed that we would exceed the resources of the business support unit. 'The fear of the police was that if we continued to issue 1,500 letters a month than we would prevent other schemes in the country from issuing their letters. 'We were basically letting speeders off. We would go with an extra 10 people who had been doing 45mph in a 30 zone but they wouldn't go over the quota. Mr McCandless and his team caught 40,000 speeding drivers in the Cambridgeshire towns of St Ives (pictured) and Ramsey. Their technique was to set up cameras at the side of the road during rush hour . 'In the end because I kept going on at them I got a bit of a reputation but basically we were a victim of our own success. 'Because we were turning in these high numbers and they were so accurate they became suspicious that something was going on.' He added: 'I basically got sacked for doing a good job and being too accurate. 'We were thorough and professional and we had a pride in what we were doing. I'm ex-armed forces and I always do everything by the book. The volunteer scheme Community Speed Watch was rolled out by several police forces across the country to help educate people about speeding on the roads. It currently manages 647 trained volunteers distributed across 88 local CSW groups. Volunteers operate at the roadside in areas with 20, 30 and 40 mph limits, monitoring speeds with the aid of a portable speed indication device (SID). They record and report the speed and identifying details of vehicles travelling at or above nationally-specified speed thresholds (25, 35 and 46mph respectively). Vehicle checks are undertaken by the police and letters sent to the registered keepers advising them of the speed and reminding them of why it is a community concern. It is a form of education rather than enforcement, however, if problems persist enforcement can be undertaken by the police Safer Neighbourhood teams. People wishing to set up the scheme in their area have to be prepared to fund it, which can cost up to £3,000 for the equipment. 'They are experts and they are professionals but none of them have ""kerb-side"" with us so they don't know what they are talking about.' Mr McCandless had been coordinator of the volunteers since 2010 and his team increased the accuracy of their speed detectors using the same technology as the Dambusters. They clipped on a wooden sight similar to those used by airmen to pinpoint the dropping point for the bouncing bombs designed by Barnes Wallis used in the dams raid. He said his volunteers caught more motorists than any other scheme in the county because they targeted drivers at rush hour. Mr McCandless now plans to set up his own independent group and has complained to the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Sir Graham Bright about his treatment. A spokesman for the PCC said they had written to the Chief Constable and asked him to respond to the claims. But Cambridgeshire Constabulary has said Mr McCandless's position became 'unsustainable' as he was 'unable to share our vision of education'. A police spokesman said: 'As a force, we support the great work of our SpeedWatch volunteers, and the work they do to help us educate drivers to change their behaviour through high visibility deployments in areas of community concern. 'We have 155 groups across the county - all made up of local volunteers, and we continue to work with those groups to make the county's roads safer.'","David McCandless, 69, caught around 1,600 speeding drivers every month .

"'Cold towel sir?' asked a petite Filipina as I stepped onto the jetty of the Constance Moofushi Resort in the Maldives. It was the fourth cold towel in as many hours. Reaching my overwater bungalow, I kicked off my shoes, changed into swimming shorts and perused the room. It was posh-rustic with ethnic wood carvings, semi-outdoor shower and a glorious terrace poised over the turquoise sea. I walked down my personal steps, under my personal rainforest shower, and swam in my personal Indian Ocean. A small shark swaggered by, angelfish darted off and the ripples of white sand felt indulgent under foot. A little piece of paradise: The Moofushi Resort does the idea of all-inclusive with a little dash of style . Back in my room, I grabbed a beer from the minibar. And began to fidget. 'I know,' I thought, 'I'll walk around the island.' Twenty minutes later, I'd explored the thatched main restaurant and circled the island. Back in my room, I sought a new distraction in a can of Carlsberg and some crisps. Then I read pages on the Smart TV about Moofushi's all-inclusive package. No more wristbands, house plonk and sky-high mini-bar prices; just fine cuisine, premium brand beers and spirits and wine from Provence. After that, I padded barefoot to the Totem bar to put it to the test. At the cute beachside hangout, I polished off a draught Tiger beer and more nibbles, then made a pen-on-the-palm gesture to the barman. He wobbled his head politely: 'There is nothing to sign, sir.' There was nothing to sign in the restaurants either, where I ceased being sniffy about 'all-inclusive' on my second helping of sashimi. Smells to swoon over wafted across the Manta restaurant from the grill hut. The buffet brimmed with sushi and salads, and mains such as Thai green chicken curry, Mongolian lamb, and reef fish with tarragon. To my surprise, the three novels I'd packed went unread. Instead I joined a yoga class, drank some Cosmopolitans, had a massage looking down at fish swimming under the treatment hut, drank some more Cosmopolitans and took a sunset cruise in a traditional dhoni. I had a try-dive too, right off the jetty, and explored the incredible house reef with just a few lazy flicks of my fins. I paddled a kayak, enjoyed a wine tasting, and went on a boat trip to the neighbouring island of Himandhoo (population 750). Scarcely dull: Richard was worried that he would be bored in the Maldives - but found plenty to do . Here, sparky local lad Nazim showed me his 314-year-old mosque and the banyan tree he climbed up to hide in as a child. Lazy lunches and drawn-out dinners blurred into late-night cocktails. In the Alizee Restaurant, the sommelier suggested a glass of Secateurs Chenin Blanc 2013 with my starter. 'It's citrus and apricot with some honeysuckle at the end,' he said. I might have been at an elegant restaurant in Mayfair. My new best friend, though, was Goram, from India's Himalayan foothills. He quickly came to know that I liked my Bloody Marys spicy, and introduced me to his award-winning concoction called Indian Snowfall. All too soon I was saying cheerio to Goram and the gang, before making the walk along the jetty for the seaplane to Male. Of course, I made use of one final cold towel. Turquoise Holidays (01494 678400, www.turquoiseholidays.co.uk) offers seven nights at Constance Moofushi (www.constancehotels.com) from £2,624pp, staying in a beach villa on all-inclusive basis, including flights from Heathrow and seaplane transfers, non-motorised watersports, a meal in the Alizee restaurant and a sunset cruise.","The Constance Moofushi Resort is an all-inclusive Maldivian retreat .

"NASCAR driver Clint Bowyer had an extraordinary rant blasting race organizers for trying to put on a 'cute show' after he spectacularly crashed out of Daytona 500 qualifying. The 35-year-old spun off the track after he made contact with the back of Reed Sorenson's Number 44 Chevrolet, accusing him of making a desperate move in the build up. Parts of debris started flying off both cars before they came to a stop. A furious Bowyer then got out of his car and approached Sorenson's driver's side window to yell at him. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: Clint Bowyer spun of the track after he made contact with the back of Reed Sorenson's Number 44 Chevrolet during qualifying for the Daytona 500 on Sunday . Furious: Parts of debris started flying off both cars before they came to a stop. A furious Bowyer then got out of his car and approached Sorenson's driver's side window to start an argument . After he was checked over by medical officials, he was interviewed by Fox Sports and slammed the new qualifying process that had been initiated. Drivers initially competed for positions through single-car runs. But they introduced group qualifying last season and decided to use it for the Daytona 500. Visibly angry by what had happened, Bowyer said: 'It's just idiotic to be out here doing this anyway. 'There is no sense in being able to try and put on some cute show for whatever the hell this is, then you've got a guy out there in desperation doing crap like this. 'There's no reason to be out here. These guys have been working for six months, busting their ass on these cars, to go out there have some guy out of desperation pull this crap. Angry: After stepping out of his wrecked car and getting checked over by medical staff, Bowyer said in an interview with Fox Sports: 'It's just idiotic to be out here doing this' Cause: He shifted the blame to NASCAR during the interview, blasting the new qualifying format that had been put in place . 'It ain't his fault. It's not. It's NASCAR's fault for putting us out here in the middle of this crap for nothing. We used to come down here and worry about who was going to sit on the front row and pole for the biggest race of the year. 'Now all we do is worry about how a start-and-park like this out of desperation is going to knock us out of the Daytona 500. We've been in meetings for 45 minutes just to figure out what the hell everybody's going to do just to make the race. It's stupid. There's no sense in doing this.'

"A father who was battling a brain tumour at the same time as his young son was fighting a similar condition has died, leaving behind his grieving wife and children. Peter Gebruers, 42, was given two years to live when doctors said had grade four glioma - a cancerous brain tumour - after he suffered a seizure while driving last April. Just weeks earlier Mr Gebruers and his wife Lucy, 38, were dealt a devastating blow when doctors said Joshua, seven, had a rare brain condition which puts him at a high risk of having a stroke. For the next two years, both Mr Gebruers and Joshua underwent radiotherapy treatment, and he also had chemotherapy. Despite this, Mrs Gebruers, from Solihull, West Midlands, has now revealed her husband - whom she describes as 'a wonderful husband and cherished father' - has lost his battle with the disease. Peter Gebruers, 42, was battling brain cancer at the same time his son had been diagnosed with a rare brain disorder that put him at an increased risk of having a stroke. His family have now announced that Mr Gebruers has now lost the battle to the disease . In January 2014, Joshua, seven (right) had been diagnosed with a rare brain disorder. Days before he was due to start treatment, Mr Gebruers had a seizure while driving Joshua and his sister Amelia, eight (centre left), home from school . Writing on Facebook, she said: 'It's with the heaviest heart imaginable that I say RIP my wonderful husband. 'Fourteen years to the day that we moved in together he was taken from his loving family and adoring children. 'The best man, the most wonderful partner, local friend and cherished daddy. Thank you for giving me two little hearts to carry you around in because mine will never be the same again. 'I love you Pete Gebruers, and I always will. Thank you for all that we have shared. xxxxxxxxxx' MailOnline first reported on the family's bitter struggle with cancer in August 2014. The family had received the devastating news that Joshua had a life-threatening brain condition in January that year. Doctors said he had Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM), a tangle of blood vessels in the brain which puts sufferers at high risk of stroke. In April, four days after Joshua was due to start his radiotherapy treatment, Mr Gebruers had a seizure in his car while driving Joshua and Amelia, eight, home from school. Luckily, the children escaped without injury, but Mr Gebruers was admitted to Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, where doctors discovered a cancerous brain tumour. As he was receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Mr Gebruers was forced to give up his job as a pilot. His wife, Lucy, 38, took on three jobs to support the family. The couple are pictured here on their wedding day . Mr Gebruers was diagnosed with a deadly brain tumour and told he had only two years to live.  The couple are pictured with daughter Amelia before Mr Gebruer's diagnosis . While he remained in hospital, Mrs Gebruers was forced to leave his side to take Joshua for a radiotherapy appointment. She said: 'I had to leave Pete in intensive care to take Joshua to his treatment. 'My daughter Amelia was struggling as she had seen the seizure. 'I just wanted to cut myself in three to be with all of them.' Mr Gebruers, who worked as a pilot for Thomson Airlines, was given between 14 months and two years to live. Both father and son underwent radiotherapy, and Mr Gebruers also had a round of chemotherapy. Mr Gebruer's cancer meant he lost his pilot's licence and was unable to work, leaving them struggling to make ends meet. The family had cancelled their critical illness insurance cover years earlier, and so Mrs Gebruer took on three jobs so they could stay in the family home. Despite the hardship the family was facing, Mrs Gebruer said they still felt 'blessed'. She said: 'Things could be so much worse.' 'I am exhausted, but you have to do what you have to do. If I can keep us in this house by doing three jobs, I'll do three jobs. If I have to do four, I have to do four. 'I do have my dark times, but you have to seize the moment, make the most of life and that's what we intend to do. 'As soon as your start wallowing in self pity, that's when you start to deteriorate.' The whole family decided to fundraise for charity, calling themselves 'Team G', and have raise £12,000 to date . Announcing her husband's death, Mrs Gebruers wrote on Facebook: 'I love you Pete Gebruers, and I always will. 'Thank you for giving me two little hearts to carry you around in because mine will never be the same again.' She is pictured here with Joshua and Amelia before Mr Gebruers and his son fell ill . After her father and brother were diagnosed with brain conditions, eight-year-old Amelia decided she wanted to do something positive. She organised an auction and raffle at her school to raise money for The Brain Tumour Charity, and wrote a touching letter to businesses around Solihull appealing for help. 'I wanted to do something good to cancel out the sad times we're having,' Amelia said. The whole family joined in the fundraising efforts, calling themselves 'Team G' and have now raised more than £12,000 for cancer research and other causes. Mrs Gebruer says they will continue their fundraising efforts in her husband's memory. To donate to the charities, visit the family's Just Giving page or email lucygebruers@hotmail.co.uk .

"Train travellers are not being told about their right to compensation – despite as many as four in ten suffering a delay on their last journey. Passengers held up for more than an hour are entitled to a full refund. But up to eight in ten put through the misery of a long delay are not given this information, research by Which? found. The poll of 7,300 travellers paints a picture of unreliable and dirty trains, particularly on commuter routes into London. Others heading to Gatwick and Luton airports, where punctuality is vital to making flights, are also being let down. Train travellers are not being told about their right to compensation, pictured commuters waiting for  trains at Liverpool Street Station . The consumer group rated train companies for their reliability, punctuality, value for money and cleanliness to come up with an overall score for customer satisfaction. Its findings come at a time when customers are being hit with punishing ticket price rises – which have risen well above inflation. Thameslink & Great Northern, which operates services from the Home Counties into London, came out worst in the country with an overall customer satisfaction score of 43 per cent. It scored badly on cleanliness, punctuality and availability of seating. Southeastern, which also runs services through Kent and Sussex into the capital, did little better with a score of 44 per cent. Third worst was Southern, with a satisfaction score of just 46 per cent. Which? said: ‘Southern was the worst for delays with four in ten saying they were held up the last time they travelled.’ The company was recently shamed after it emerged that its 7.29am Brighton to London Victoria service failed to arrive on time once in 2014. A survey found that 33 per cent of customers for South West Trains were told about their right to a full refund . But despite Southern’s appalling record on punctuality, the survey found that just two in ten customers delayed for an hour were told about their right to a full refund. And many other companies were not much better – the figure was 27 per cent for First Great Western, 31 per cent for Southeastern, 33 per cent for South West Trains, and 38 per cent for London Overground. Most train companies are signed up to the Delay Repay scheme, where travellers delayed for 30-59 minutes can claim back 50 per cent of the cost of a single journey. A delay of 60-119 minutes allows a refund of 100 per cent of the cost of a single journey, while delays beyond this qualify for the cost of two single journeys. These refunds are usually paid in vouchers, rather than cash. Which? said: ‘Passengers often have little or no choice as to the rail companies they travel with, so as ticket prices continue to rocket, more must be done to improve customers’ satisfaction and to inform people of their right to a refund as a result of delays.’ As many as four in 10 passengers suffered a delay on their last journey. Passengers held up for more than an hour are entitled to a full refund . Grand Central – which operates in the North East through to London – came top of the customer satisfaction table with a score of 76 per cent. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators, said billions were being spent to help ‘improve passenger satisfaction’. It added that nine out of ten trains arrive on time, and that ‘compensation is increasingly generous and easy to apply for’. Thameslink said it was ‘determined to make things better’ and it knew ‘these scores are not good enough’.

"She recently lost more than three stone and slimmed down from a curvy size 16 to a svelte size eight. And Geordie Shore's Charlotte Crosby is clearly keen to showcase the fruits of her labour as she models her new fashion range for e-tailer In The Style. The 24-year-old, who has seen her fitness DVD become the biggest-selling in the last 15 years, told FEMAIL that her weight loss was the main inspiration behind her new Nostalgia range. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Crosby, who found fame on Geordie Shore, has unveiled her SS15 Nostalgia range for In The Style - and shows off her svelte new figure in the campaign imagery (dress, £32.99) She said: 'It allowed me to include tighter, sexier styles. But I've kept styles for different body shapes, too. I'll always love casual styles so we have a great mix now.' The spring/summer 2015 collection, which is priced between £16 and £46, comes after the Charlotte smashed records for the brand, with some items selling out in less than ten minutes after going live. Some pieces have been restocked over ten times due to huge demand. Charlotte, 24, recently lost more than three stone and slimmed down from a curvy size 16 to a svelte size eight so is keen to show off the results (left: shirt dress, £33.99, right: £32.99) Charlotte's range, which includes items like £32.99 this paisley tassel skater dress, sold out instantly last time . The SS15 collection comes after the Geordie Shore name smashed records for the brand, with some items selling out in less than ten minutes after going live (left: shirt dress, £35.99, right: shorts, £19.99) Charlotte, who is heading to Australia to launch her range there, explained how her collection of layered shift dresses, pastel playsuits, slogan T-shirts and floral bodycons has evolved. 'We've definitely continued designing what people loved from the last range but we've also experimented with more styles this time,' she said. 'This range is sexier and some of the styles we've designed for going out are more daring than I ever used to wear.' 'We've definitely continued designing what people loved from the last range but we've also experimented with more styles this time' she said of her range (dress, £45.99) She explains she has added plenty of sexier styles that she couldn't necessarily wear before she lost weight . Charlotte who loves 'nothing more than throwing on one of her oversized vests or slogan tees' has included casual items (slogan tees, £17.99) Charlotte admits that it would be 'amazing' to see Cheryl Fernandez-Versini wearing the range (dress, £35.99) The range perfectly encapsulates Charlotte's personal style. The reality star, who loves 'nothing more than throwing on one of her over-sized vests or slogan tees' has included casual items, as well as the party dresses she loves to wear on a night out in Newcastle. Charlotte, who cites Vanessa Hudgens as her style icon, has her sights set on one celebrity client in particular. 'It would be amazing to see Cheryl Fernandez-Versini wearing the range,' she said. 'So many celebrities wore the last range and it's always a buzz to see people in something I've had so much input into. I also love seeing my Twitter feed of people wearing them - it's always a great feeling.' The star, who wants her brand to 'take over the high street', is already plotting the future. So where does she see herself in five years time? 'Ruler of the world?,' she jokes. 'Pregnant and designing a nostalgia maternity range!'.

"Giorgio Armani has swapped clothes for interiors, creating swanky dream homes in one of the world's most exclusive apartment blocks - in the booming Indian city of Mumbai. The apartments, which are being sold by Wetherall Estates, which specialises in £50million Mayfair mansions, has signed a deal to sell the flats, with prices starting at £1.4million each. When complete next year, the luxury 1,450ft World One Tower will be the tallest residential building in the world. Giorgio Armani is designing luxury three or four-bedroom apartments in the World One Tower in Mumbai . The apartments' interiors will combine the 'Armani philosophy' with the 'magnificent textile legacy of India' Rooms have colour schemes of taupe, chocolate, grey, and cream in apartments with £1.4million price tags . It is being built by the Lodha group which is targeting super-rich Indians living in the UK. It will include 300 high-end apartments and penthouses and occupants will reach their floors in lifts only a little slower than an Olympic sprinter. The Giorgio Armani-designed interiors will boast comfort cooling, state-of-the-art home entertainment and security and electronic windows, curtains and blinds. The three and four-bedroom apartments on the upper floors wil have views over Mumbai and the Arabian Sea. The skyscraper also has a large indoor leisure complex with indoor swimming pools, gymnasium and spa. Each apartment will have a generously sized reception room, kitchen/breakfast room, luxurious bedroom suites and beautifully appointed bathrooms. The pads, on the tallest residential skyscraper in the world, will have views over the Arabian Sea . The flats are being sold by Mayfair-based Wetherell Estates which wants to tempt rich Indians living in London to snap up one of the properties in the 117-storey tower, which is due for completion next year . Wetherell Estates, in Mayfair, now has the job of tempting Indians living in London to look at buying a home in the 117-storey World One Tower, which is scheduled to be finished next year. The estate agency has been chosen because Indians currently account for 25 per cent of homebuyers in Mayfair. Only Brits buy more property in the luxury London 'village'. Indian families and developers have spent around £1billion on homes and business projects in Mayfair and the West End in the past 18 months alone. It is estimated around 3,000 rich families escape the heat of India each summer and spend their time in Mayfair instead. They typically spend between £1 and £20 million on homes, with 70 per cent spent on flats and apartments. The website for World One describes the look of each of the flats: 'The Armani/Casa Interior Design Studio creates living experiences rooted in the Armani philosophy – yet evoking all the colour, vibrancy, energy and magnificent textile legacy of India. 'Working under the personal supervision of Giorgio Armani, the Armani/Casa Interior Design Studio team will translate his vision within India`s unique culture and ethos.' The 300 high-end apartments and penthouses in the swanky block of flats will be accessed by super-fast lifts . The 1,450ft World One Tower is being built by the Lodha Group in the Worli district of South Mumbai . It describes the signature Armani residences as 'harmonious' and each home, 'exudes the perfect simplicity, sensitivity, sophistication and flair that is quintessentially Armani.' Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'The British and international-based Indian business community are extremely successful and have been major investors in prime London real estate over the last two years. 'Now Wetherell aims to tap into this market and generate some reverse marketing and sales, in order to channel some of this wealth back to India and into the luxurious residences in the World One Tower. 'Indian buyers in London are used to homes with an extremely high specification and hotel style amenities. 'Lodha Group have been extremely clever in providing the World One Tower with every luxury and leisure amenity imaginable, and the Armani Casa brand and interiors clearly demonstrates that this is an international product of a standard that can rival London, Milan and other luxury destinations.' World One Tower was designed by international architects Pei Cobb Freed & Partners and is located in the Worli district of South Mumbai, overlooking the Arabian Sea. Worli is a leafy downtown suburb where, during the days of the Raj, the British administrators had their luxury villas and bungalows. The tower will leapfrog 432 Park Avenue in New York which at 1,398-feet high is currently the world's tallest residential tower. The building, with its interiors that wouldn't be out of place in a five star hotel, will be taller than the current highest residential tower, 432 Park Avenue in New York, which is 1,398 feet tall . Wetherell's chief executive said potential buyers are used to 'high specification and hotel style amenities'.","1,450ft World One Tower will be the world's highest residential building .

"A photo of President Barack Obama was mistakenly used by a Fox news affiliate to represent a suspect in a college sexual assault case. The photo of the president appeared on KSWB when anchor Kathleen Bade said 'The only suspect in a sex assault at SDSU (San Diego State University) will not be charged.' KSWB soon cut to footage of a different man with authorities, as Bade announced 'The District Attorney's Office says they decided not to file charges against 20-year-old Francisco Sousa because the evidence against him is weak.' Mistake: A photo of President Obama popped up during a report on a sexual assault suspect . According to the Times of San Diego, the photo of Obama - which had the words 'NO CHARGES' underneath it - was shown Friday at 10:04pm. The Times of San Diego was the first to report on KSWB's error. In an interview with the newspaper, KSWB assignment editor Mike Wille said the image was up for approximately 5 seconds and instantly spotted. Wille told the Times of San Diego 'Yeah, there was an accident when they had an over-the-shoulder. It wasn't on purpose.' The assignment editor also said he did not know what time Bade learned about the Obama photo. He told the Times of San Diego 'They really don't do that when it's a small thing like that' in response to a question from the newspaper over a potential live acknowledgement or apology. No one phoned KSWB in the middle of Friday's 10pm news regarding the photo, Wille told the news outlet. KSWB did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online.

"Her face etched with anxiety, the sister of British drug mule Lindsay Sandiford waits outside Bali’s notorious Kerokoban jail as a spate of executions for Western prisoners looms. Hilary Parsons arrived with three lawyers today in a bid to save the 58-year-old grandmother, who was convicted of trying to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine in 2012, from the firing squad. Ms Parsons’ dash to the Indonesian island was spurred by what appears to be the imminent threat of execution for the two Australian ringleaders of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling ring, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Scroll down for video . Worry: Her face etched with anxiety, Hilary Parsons (right) - the sister of British drug mule Lindsay Sandiford (left) - waited outside Bali’s notorious Kerokoban jail today as part of a last-minute bid to save her life . Visitor: Ms Parsons, pictured, arrived at the island jail with three lawyers to speak to her condemned sister . She arrived at the prison as representatives of Indonesia’s legal department were meeting Australian officials in Jakarta, where the executions of Chan and Sukumaran were in the final stages of preparation. ‘It’s like they will be transferred to the place where they will face the firing squad in a matter of days,’ said Tony Spontana, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Attorney-General. ‘Maybe this week…hopefully. We’re already at the stage of planning the executions and these must be implemented.’ With the threat of death now close for the Australian pair, Ms Parsons’ fears for her sister’s life are understood to have increased dramatically. She declined to make any comment when she arrived at Kerobokan prison today. Death row: Mrs Sandiford pictured left in 2013 and right earlier this month, when with the help of a translator she read a letter from Indonesian prosecutors notifying her that she was listed for execution . Condemned: Australians Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right), the ringleaders of the Bali Nine drug ring, have been told they will be the next prisoners to be executed and could be shot within days . Her sister was convicted of trying to smuggle cocaine through Bali airport in 2012. Recently-elected President Joko Widodo has announced that he will show no mercy for people sentenced to death for serious drug offences. So far he has held to his word with the execution last month of six prisoners for drug-linked offences. However, the Attorney General’s Department has made it clear that no-one will be put to death until they have exhausted every possible legal avenue - and that is where Ms Parsons’ hopes hang. It is understood grandmother Mrs Sandiford, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, has one last legal attempt at saving her own life and that is to ask for a judicial review of her case. Knitting: Mrs Sandiford has been languishing on death row since being convicted of drugs smuggling in 2012 . Hearings: The grandmother has faced a string of courts in her bid to be saved from the death penalty, which was not requested by prosecutors. She insisted she carried the drugs because her son was threatened . She has already received a letter from the prosecutor’s office in Bali's capital, Denpasar, pointing out her rights to lodge what is known as a PK application - an appeal for a judicial review. But the British government has refused to give her any funds to employ a lawyer and she told friends last month that without a local legal expert she has no idea how to conduct the process. Ms Parsons told News Corporation recently that her family were ‘terrified’ at what lay ahead. At the prison today Ms Parsons was accompanied by two Indonesian lawyers and a legal representative from Australia. It was not clear who was paying them. Long fight: Mrs Sandiford was arrested in May 2012 . Early 2012: Lindsay Sandiford, who was born in Yorkshire and had been living in Gloucester, sets up home in India. May 17 2012: Mrs Sandiford allegedly meets two members of a drug syndicate in Bangkok, Thailand, and collects a suitcase packed with 4.8 kilos of cocaine. May 19: She flies to Denpasar airport, the main airport on Bali, where customs officials X-ray the suitcase and find the drugs. She is arrested. May 20: She is interrogated by drug squad officers who suggest it will be in her interest to tell all she knows about the syndicate. She agrees. August: She is moved to Kerobokan prison, where, because she is so important to the police case, she is held in solitary confinement. Early September: She is believed to have written to the British Embassy and Indonesian government officials claiming she is being badly treated and does not have enough food or water. September 27: Mrs Sandiford makes her first court appearance, accused of drug trafficking. She is tearful and covers her head with a scarf, maintaining that she had agreed to carry the suitcase because her son Elliot, 21, was being threatened by a drug gang. December: She is convicted but her lawyers plead for leniency because of her co-operation. The prosecution say they want her jailed for 15 years, rather than receive a death sentence. January 14 2013: In a 'last chance' hearing, her lawyer pleads for even less than the 15 years because her son was being threatened and she was coerced into carrying the cocaine. January 22: She, her lawyer and even the prosecution are stunned by the death sentence, after one of the judges said she had brought a bad reputation to Bali's tourism. January 28: The grandmother files her formal appeal against the sentence, which was imposed after judges said there were no mitigating circumstances in her favour. April 8: Bali's High Court upholds Mrs Sandiford's conviction after British well-wishers raise thousands of pounds to pay her legal fees. She appeals to the country's Supreme Court. August 30: Bali's Supreme Court upholds the decision to have her shot. She languishes in Kerobokan prison with only two hopes remaining - that she receives clemency directly from the Indonesian president, or that the country's Supreme Court agrees to reopen the case. July 16 2014: Britain's Supreme Court rejects a bid by Mrs Sandiford to have the UK government pay her legal bills, but the five judges say there are 'serious issues' about the quality of Sandiford's trial and there should be an 'urgent review of the policy as it applies to her'. November: Her hopes for clemency from the Indonesian president are dashed as newly-elected Joko Widodo reiterates his zero-tolerance stance against drug smugglers. February 2 2015: Indonesia reveals the two Australian ringleaders of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling ring, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, will be the next to be executed. February 7: It emerges Mrs Sandiford has been notified that she is formally listed for execution. February 16: Mrs Sandiford's sister Hilary Parsons returns to Kerobokan prison with three lawyers as part of a last-ditch attempt to secure her freedom.","Hilary Parsons' sister  on death row for smuggling £1.6m  cocaine in 2012 .

"MI5 blocked police investigations into sexual abuse at a children’s home to protect their intelligence gathering operation, campaigners will tell the High Court today. Victims of abuse at the Kincora children’s home in Northern Ireland have accused senior members of the security services of colluding in protecting abusers from being investigated or prosecuted. Campaigners are taking legal action at the High Court in Belfast to force a full independent inquiry with the power to force MI5 witnesses to testify and release documents. Victims of abuse at the Kincor children's home in Northern Ireland, pictured, have accused senior members of the security services of blocking police investigations . The case is the first to examine allegations of a British state cover-up of abuse at the East Belfast home in the 1970s. Claims that children were molested for years because police and the British security services were using the home, run by a member of a Protestant paramilitary organisation, to gather intelligence are already subject to a separate inquiry in Northern Ireland, the Historical and Institutional Abuse (HIA) inquiry, led by Sir Anthony Hart. But critics of the HIA claim it lacks sufficient powers to get to the heart of the scandal as it may not be able to compel either evidence or witnesses from MI5. Victims are applying for a judicial review to establish a similar full inquiry in Northern Ireland to the London-based child abuse inquiry, now chaired by Justice Lowell Goddard from New Zealand. Lawyers for the victims have lodged papers in Belfast High Court arguing: ‘There is credible evidence (and it is therefore arguable) that the security forces and security services were aware of the abuse, permitted it to continue and colluded in protecting the individuals involved from investigation or prosecution.’ Senior members of the Loyalist community, the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary have also been accused of collusion, blackmail and cover-up. Claims that children were molested for years because police and the British security services were using the home to gather intelligence is already subject to a separate inquiry led by Sir Anthony Hart, pictured . One alleged victim of the abuse at Kincora, Gary Hoy, was placed there with his younger brother in the 1970s. He said in a sworn affidavit: ‘If we had had a proper inquiry in the 1980s then I wouldn’t have to relive this again today. MI5 and MI6 cannot be allowed to hide things, and I believe everything needs to be brought out into the open. ‘I find it heart-wrenching that there were security men could have been behind the abuse or involved in it … Because they were in positions of authority or supposed to be protecting the state they get away with it.’ Solicitor Kevin Winters who is representing Mr Hoy and other survivors said: ‘The allegations of our clients and others have been in the public domain for years; the role of state has been alleged for a long time. There is now an opportunity for the truth to be uncovered for our clients to be able to move on with their fractured lives. ‘This opportunity is possibly being lost because of the UK government’s fear of being exposed to impunity and straightforward corruption and criminality against innocents used as pawns in a cynical political exercise.’ He added: ‘This is about state agents in a very dark episode of the conflict in the North of Ireland.’ A former British military official has also backed a full inquiry. Colin Wallace, a former army information officer in Northern Ireland, said: ‘There is now irrefutable evidence that previous inquiries were deliberately engineered or manipulated to mislead parliament by concealing the role of government agencies in covering up the abuses.’ In 1981, three men were imprisoned for between four and six years for a number of offences relating to systematic sexual abuse of children over a period of years. But the allegations of MI5 involvement have never been fully examined. It has suggested that William McGrath, Kincora’s housemaster and the leader of an extreme evangelical Protestant group called Tara, was an informant for British intelligence. McGrath was jailed for sexual offences in 1981 and is now dead. An Amnesty International spokesman said: ‘There are longstanding claims that MI5 blocked one or more police investigations into Kincora in the 1970s in order to protect its own intelligence-gathering operation, a terrible indictment which raises the spectre of countless vulnerable boys having faced further years of brutal abuse. ‘It’s only Justice Goddard’s inquiry that will be able to ensure that evidence doesn’t remain hidden in Whitehall filing cabinets and that even senior politicians will have to attend the inquiry.’ A Home Office spokesperson said: ‘The government is cooperating fully with all investigations into allegations relating to the Kincora boys’ home. It is not appropriate to comment further while these investigations are under way.’","Victims of abuse at Kincora Children's Home say MI5 blocked investigation .

"Ask Claire Croft how many children she has and she'll say: 'Three.' In fact her youngest, Jake, tragically died just a few months ago. But as Claire explains: 'I'll always have three children. And I am still Jake's mother.' Her darling boy was just four-and-a-half when he passed away last October. The speed with which he became ill left Claire, 29, husband Stuart and their two older children reeling. Jake had loved playing football and rough and tumble with Jack, 12, and Alex, seven. 'One moment he was running around with his brothers,' recalls Claire, a stay-at-home mum from Barnsley, South Yorkshire. 'The next, I was organising his funeral. It happened so fast, I still don't think I have come to terms with it.' Scroll down for video . Jake Croft from Barnsley, South Yorkshire was four-and-a-half when he passed away last October . Jake was just about to start his reception year at school when he started complaining of 'achy legs' in August last year. 'I just thought it must be growing pains - I'd heard lots of mums say their children's legs ached sometimes,' says Claire. 'Some days he had no pain at all, others he would complain that it hurt a lot, sometimes in the lower part. As the term progressed, I thought, maybe he just wasn't keen to go to school.' In fact, the medical consensus is that growing limbs do not normally cause pain. As Dr Kate Wheeler, a consultant in paediatric oncology at Oxford Children's Hospital says categorically: 'Growing pains do not exist.' Some children between the ages of three and 12 may suffer from pains in the legs at night, adds Dr Martin English, a consultant paediatric oncologist at Birmingham Children's Hospital. 'But there is no evidence this is due to growth itself and in some cases may just be the aches and pains after physical activity that anyone would have. It may be that some children are more aware of pains than others.' Sometimes GPs may use the term 'growing pains' if they're unsure of the cause of child's pain, but 'if a problem persists or is getting worse, the cause should be reconsidered,' says Dr English, who is a spokesman for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. For instance, 'growing pains' may be a sign of an underlying condition such as childhood arthritis. Jake (centre) pictured with mother Claire, father Stuart and siblings Jack and Alex . Pain around the upper part of the shin (tibia) in rapidly growing, active children may also be linked to Osgood-Schlatters disease, a painful condition that causes inflammation of the tendon that attaches the knee cap to the shin - this is not serious and usually clears up over time. Dr Wheeler warns that if a child has pains in the legs and other symptoms such as persistent limping, pain or bruising, parents should not assume it is just 'growing pains' - 'they should always get their child seen by a doctor'. As Claire is now all too keenly aware, in rare cases 'growing pains' can be a sign of something serious. A month after Jake started complaining of achy legs he lost his appetite and developed bruises on his shins that varied in size from that of a 5p coin to a 50p piece. 'I thought perhaps he was being kicked at school, so I went to his teacher,' says Claire. 'But she said nothing like that was happening and Jake was happy at school.' By now it was October, six weeks after he had first complained of achy legs and Claire decided to take him to the GP. He complained of 'achy legs' and Claire thought it must be growing pains . He examined Jake and ordered blood and urine tests at the hospital. The next day the hospital called to ask Claire and Stuart to bring Jake in straight away as his white blood cell count was unusually high. 'My stomach lurched,' says Claire. 'I was terrified.' That afternoon Claire and Stuart, 38, hurried back to hospital with Jake. Doctors told them the heartbreaking news that Jake might have leukaemia. He was immediately transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital for scans. Afterwards, Claire and Stuart were led to a quiet room. 'I saw the consultant's face and I knew then there was something much worse going on,' Claire says. 'Before, when we'd talked of leukaemia, although it was terrifying, everyone seemed so hopeful and mentioned that the success rate if treated early was high, but now the tone changed. 'I remember hearing her speak and then watching as Stuart just collapsed into his seat.' The consultant said Jake had an aggressive children's cancer called neuroblastoma. There was only a 30 per cent chance of survival. Jake was at stage four - an advanced stage - of the disease. Neuroblastoma is a cancer of specialised nerve cells called neural crest cells that are particularly concentrated in the adrenal glands above the kidney and on either side of the vertebrae in the spine. Jake's tumour had begun on his right kidney. Claire says: 'We were told the doctors would still fight it with chemotherapy, but the odds were stacked against us. I was reeling. I hadn't even taken it in. How had ""growing pains"" in my healthy boy been hiding this?' There are about 100 cases of neuroblastoma diagnosed a year in Britain. 'It's very much a children's disease,' says Dr Wheeler. 'Ninety per cent of patients are under five years old, but very occasionally it can develop in an older child, a teenager or an adult.' The symptoms can vary from child to child, but early warning signs of the disease include a protruding abdomen, unexplained weight loss and limping or pain in one or both legs. Even now, Claire constantly casts her mind back - trying to remember signs she may have overlooked. 'But just days earlier Jake had been playing his computer games or running after his brothers.' After his diagnosis Jake remained in hospital. Two weeks after he was admitted, he was sedated for an MIBG scan - a nuclear scan which involves an injection of radioactive liquid - which looks for abnormal cell growth in the body. Jake never regained consciousness. 'A consultant took me aside,' says Claire. 'I only had to look at his face to know. He confirmed Jake's organs were failing.' The scans showed his liver was riddled with tumours and in the hours that followed Jake's heart stopped twice. Oncologists tried Jake with his first round of chemotherapy - desperate to try anything even at this stage. But it didn't work. Jake (right) with his brothers Jack and Alex . 'They brought him back each time his heart stopped, but then a doctor told me this would simply keep on happening. I knew what he was saying. Jake's poor little body had been through so much. We had to make the hardest decision of our lives.' He had been put onto life support, but even this wasn't working. Claire and Stuart decided to let him go. Later that day, Jake passed away in his mother's arms. It was only 14 days after he'd first seen the GP. 'I walked around in a numb haze, unable to accept it,' says Claire. 'I went through every stage of grief - disbelief, anger and back to disbelief again.' The family banned anyone from wearing black to the funeral and, instead of having flowers, they released balloons into the sky. Now, although still in the depths of her grief, Claire wants to raise awareness of the signs of children's cancer among other parents. 'The trouble with the symptoms, is that so many of them can be explained away,' she says. 'The aching legs I thought were growing pains, the bruised shins could have been from rough and tumble. I had no idea these symptoms meant he had the most aggressive form of cancer. I look back every day at pictures and ask myself: did he have it then? I'll never know.' In the months after her son's death, she found some comfort after visiting Jake's oncologist. 'The consultant told me Jake's was the most aggressive form of neuroblastoma she'd seen in her career and that he'd probably only had it for around two months. 'She said even if we had started chemotherapy earlier it may have had the same result.' Since Jake died Claire says it is only thanks to her other children and Stuart she's been able to cope. 'It's because of them I am still here,' she says. 'I don't think I could have carried on otherwise.' All she can do is hope no other parent has to endure the same heartache. 'If my story can help another mother spot the signs in her child, then that's something I can be proud of in Jake's memory,' she says. neuroblastoma.org.uk .","Jake Croft was four-and-a-half when he passed away last October .

"Women who do strenuous activity two to three times a week are 20 per cent less likely to suffer heart problems, new research says . Exercising vigorously for just ten minutes twice a week is enough to help middle-aged women avoid heart disease, a study has found. Women who did strenuous activity two to three times a week – enough to cause sweating or a fast heartbeat – were 20 per cent less likely to suffer from heart problems, stroke and blood clots than inactive women, researchers said. Those who did gentler exercise, such as walking, gardening or cycling, four to six times a week had the same reduction in their risk of heart disease. Indeed, doing any physical activity at all was found to lower risk by a certain amount, compared with being inactive. But surprisingly, getting active more than three times a week did not result in a further drop in risk. The chance of heart disease was no lower among the small proportion of women who did some strenuous activity more than three times a week than among those who did so two to three times. The Oxford University research, which is published in the journal Circulation, is based on data from more than a million UK women who took part in the Million Women Study, a major health project that was started in 1996. The latest analysis was funded by the British Heart Foundation, the Medical Research Council and Cancer Research UK. Lead author Dr Miranda Armstrong, a physical activity epidemiologist, said: ‘Inactive middle-aged women should try to do some activity regularly. ‘Positively, the research showed that every effort to be physically active could contribute to improving heart health. Women who were active two to three times a week were able to cut the risk of heart disease substantially.’ The finding comes during the British Heart Foundation’s Heart Month, when the charity is urging people to spend ten minutes each day making small lifestyle changes to improve their heart health. Doireann Maddock, senior cardiac nurse at the BHF, said: ‘This research reinforces evidence that you don’t have to run marathons or spend hours at the gym to improve your heart health. Exercising vigorously for just ten minutes twice a week is enough to help middle-aged women avoid heart disease . ‘Even if you don’t have much time to spare, just a couple of weekly sessions to get your heart rate going can help to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke.’ Tom Stansfeld, of Cancer Research UK, commented: ‘This study shows how important physical activity is for your health – and it’s not only your heart that stands to benefit. ‘Even small amounts of physical activity can reduce the risk of breast, bowel and womb cancers. ‘Being active in any way you can – even if it’s just walking to the station or getting off the bus a few stops earlier – is a great thing for your overall health.’ Britons are advised to do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate activity. But almost a third get less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, and one in ten does not manage to walk for more than five minutes at a time over a month. A can of sugary drink a day increases your risk of dying from heart disease by a third, health campaigners warn. They have unveiled a poster campaign to highlight the risks of drinks such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which they say are linked to tooth decay and type 2 diabetes, while a can a day could lead to weight gain of over a stone in a year. The campaign, called GULP – Give Up Loving Pop – comes from the Health Equalities Group, based in Liverpool and funded by the NHS and local authorities. Director Robin Ireland said: ‘Few people fully realise the harm that sugary drinks can do to your health. . . We’ve launched our GULP campaign to get the message across and take the fight to the manufacturers.’ Soft drinks are now the largest single source of sugar for teens and children aged four to ten. Many groups want a tax on the drinks to reduce consumption and fund health schemes. Recent research by the University of Liverpool suggests a 20p per litre tax in London alone could prevent 1,100 cancers, 6,300 cases of type 2 diabetes, and cut the number with heart disease and strokes by 4,300. Such a levy would add around 7p to the price of a standard can. The British Soft Drinks Association accused the campaign of ‘scaremongering’.","Ten minutes exercise a twice a week can reduce the risk of heart disease .

"When Tennessee Titans star Delanie Walker broke up with his girlfriend just before Valentine's Day this year, his spurned ex took matters into her own hands to keep him from finding a date for the most romantic holiday of the year. The 30-year-old tight end's longtime girlfriend Racine Lewin, 31, hacked into his Instagram account on Saturday, to post a picture of them together in happier times. She captured the sweet picture with a bitter rant, accusing him of infidelity. She also claims he broke up with her even though she is four months pregnant. 'This is my girlfriend/fiancé of 10 years. Her name is Racine. I broke up with her just a few days ago, like I do every February because I have no self control in the off season. I'm a 'celebrity' and she no longer looks good enough for my 'image' while I'm not playing football,' the now-deleted post read. Time to get a better password: Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker (right) had his Instagram account hacked by his ex-girlfriend Racine Lewin (left) on Valentine's Day . Cheater? Lewin posted a picture of her with Walker during happier times which she captioned with a rant about his alleged infidelity. Walker pictured above during a December 2014 against the Jacksonville Jaguars . 'She's also 4 months pregnant so I figured it was the perfect time to take advantage of her. I've been canoodling around Nashville like a whore telling everyone that I'm single even though we planned this child and have been asking her to marry me for the past 5 years.' Lewin goes on to describe Walker as being a liar who only cares about his 'image'. At the end of the rant, Lewin adds that Walker sent her four dozen roses on Valentine's Day to cheer up, and breaks the news that they are expecting a daughter. 'All jokes aside, surprise Delanie you are having a girl. Congratulations...Love, Racine.' Lewin later apologized for the breach of privacy in a post on her own Instagram account, saying the act was 'completely out of my character'. Making up or breaking up? Lewin later posted a picture to her personal Instagram account of the four dozen roses Walker sent her on Valentine's Day to cheer her up . She also posted pictures of the roses that Walker sent her as a Valentine's Day gift, and confirmed that the two had indeed split. Walker has not yet commented on the social media spat. Lewin described their relationship issues in more detail, saying that she lost trust in Walker a long time ago but decided to stay with him after they experienced a miscarriage a few years ago. 'For all of you saying its my fault I stayed for 10 years... your right, but easier said than done when you love someone. It was really the death of our baby boy back in 2010 that made me stay... Promises of another baby, gifts, family, marriage, lies.... All really enticing to a girl who is already broken.' However, she says she is stronger now and wants to set an example for her unborn daughter by standing up for herself and breaking things off. Snapped: In another post on her personal Instagram account, Lewin wrote that the hack was 'completely out of my character' 'The last thing I want is our daughter to think it's ok or normal to be disrespected by a man. So it stops now, before she is born, one way or another. If we didn't love each other, we wouldn't have made it this far.. But love without trust, loyalty, or respect was bound to crumble,' she wrote. Walker has been playing football since his days at Pomona High School, located in an eastern suburb of Los Angeles, California. He went on to play college ball at  Central Missouri before being recruited in the sixth round of the 2006 draft to play for the San Francisco 49ers. Walker played for the 49ers for six years before transferring to his current team, the Titans. According to public records, Lewin lived in the San Francisco Bay Area around the time that Walker started playing for the 49ers, so they may have met during his early professional football days.

"U.S. talk show host John Oliver has put Australia's plain packaging cigarette laws in the spotlight in his latest segment in which he takes on big tobacco companies. The host of HBO's Last Week Tonight used his segment to demonstrate how cigarette brands use their power to fight against government health initiatives designed to reduce smoking rates in countries around the world. Oliver began his segment by describing tobacco as: 'An aging product that's decreasing in popularity and yet somehow, it just can't stop making money. It's basically the agricultural equivalent of U2.' Scroll down for video . U.S. talk show host John Oliver has put Australia's plain packaging cigarette laws in the spotlight . The host of HBO's Last Week Tonight used his latest segment to demonstrate how cigarette brands use their power to fight against government health initiatives designed to reduce smoking rates . In the 18-minute video he went on to discuss the lengths cigarette companies go to when faced with the introduction of laws that limit their ability to market to consumers – starting with the fight faced by the Australian Government before it introduced new cigarette branding laws in 2012. 'Australia's plain packaging laws banned tobacco company branding from packaging and replaced it with upsetting photos such as the toe tag on a corpse, the cancerous mouth, the nightmarish eyeball or the diseased lung,' he said. 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, since this law was implemented total consumption of tobacco and cigarettes in Australia fell to record lows… and nightmares about eyeballs have risen to record highs.' He then pointed to a picture of a health warning on a cigarette package and joked: 'Take it down, take down the demon eye!' Oliver made reference to Australian Department of Health statistics which show that consumption of cigarettes and tobacco fell to their lowest recorded levels ($3.405 billion) in the March quarter of 2014, down from $3.508 billion in the December quarter of 2012. Oliver made reference to Australian Department of Health statistics which show that consumption of cigarettes and tobacco fell to their lowest recorded levels following introduction of plain packaging . The talk show host then went on to suggest a 'compromise' with tobacco companies, allowing them to market their products using 'Jeff the Diseased Lung' as their mascot. Oliver encouraged people to tweet using the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which started trending on Twitter. It's not the first time the popular HBO show – which has a large online fan base with more than 1.3 million subscribers on YouTube – has spoken about the Australian Government. In June last year Oliver took a much less favourable look at Australia's political landscape by collating a series of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's biggest gaffes.

"Last year, the community of Cypress, Texas, was shaken when a family of four was discovered dead in their homes, each killed with a bullet to the head. Any sense of calm has stubbornly refused to return for neighbors, as police say they still have no leads into who killed Maoye Sun, 50, and Mei Xie, 49, and their two sons, 7 and 9. 'I hope every time you blink, you see the images of these children,' Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia said at a recent press conference. Quadruple murder: Husband Maoye Sun and wife Mei Xie were found dead last year along with their boys, Timothy and Titus, all of whom had been shot at least once in the head in their bedrooms . 'I want you to remember that you killed two children. I want that to burn in your brain. I want you to have no peace in your life until you turn yourself in and confess.' KPRC reports that the reward for information was raised to $75,000 from $70,000 as the Houston Chinese Alliance and other community leaders try to keep focus on the Sun family. 'The community's disappointed due to the lack of progress,' said the Houston Chinese Alliance's Howard Xu. 'We urge the community to ask people who have information to contact Crime Stoppers or the investigators.' On January 30 of last year, police visited the Sun residence after one of the parents were reported to not have shown up for work. There, Sun and Xie were found dead along with their boys, Timothy and Titus, all of whom had been shot at least once in the head in their bedrooms.

The Houston Chronicle reported that what was first believed to be a grisly murder-suicide scene was ruled a homicide when police found several of the windows had been broken. The two boys, students at Sampson Elementary School, had last been seen on January 23. News of the murders even reached China, where Maoye Sun, who has worked as an engineering analyst at several petroleum drilling companies, was reportedly connected a former Chinese security official currently the subject of a corruption probe, according to KHOU.

"Now raspberries have been added to the growing list of Nanna's frozen berries that people should throw out of their freezers as the risk of hepatitis A continues. The latest recall is for the 1kg packs of Nanna’s Raspberries with best before dates until 15/09/16 - it does not apply to the Creative Gourmet Raspberries 300g and 500g packs as the Chinese supplier, believed to have contaminated the recalled items, no longer supplies these particular products. As the number of people who have contracted hepatitis A from consuming frozen berries rises to nine across Australia, one woman has revealed her anger and fear over potentially being diagnosed with the virus. This comes as people who ate berries linked to the hepatitis A scare have been banned from donating blood for two months tests as the service tests for 70 diseases, but not hepatitis A due to its low risk. The latest recall is for the 1kg packs of Nanna’s Raspberries with best before dates until 15/09/16 . While those who have donated, either on or after 1 November 2014, after eating the berries is asked to contact the Red Cross Blood Service on 13 14 95, so they can identify any risks posed to those receiving blood. 'This will help us identify whether or not we need to take further action to minimise the unlikely event of hepatitis A being spread via blood transfusion,' Red Cross Blood Service spokesman Shaun Inguanzo said. Patties Foods CEO, Steven Chaur, said the further recall on raspberries was a precautionary measure as investigations identified the potential link of the product to the Chinese supplier in question. 'While there are no confirmed test results indicating a potential link to Hepatitis A, we are working proactively with health authorities based on the information they have presented to date,' said on the company's Facebook page. Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, had been using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies until Sunday evening, when she was alerted to the health warning which had been issued. 'I'm really angry ... (and) it's absolutely terrified me', Ms Sims told Daily Mail Australia. So far four cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed in Queensland, three in Victoria, and two in New South Wales. Ms Sims' case could take the national toll to ten. Doctors say she is exhibiting common symptoms of the disease and expect to formally diagnose her with the virus when her results come back on Tuesday morning. Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, had been using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies and doctors suspect she has hepatitis A . The products which have been pulled from shelves are Nanna's Mixed Berries 1 kilogram packets, and the 300 and 500 gram varieties of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. 'Over the last two to three weeks I've been getting quite sick and I just thought it was a flu,' Ms Sims revealed. 'Last night I just couldn't really swallow anymore and I was going to make a frozen drink like I have been for the last four to six weeks,' she added added. After her partner Trevor alerted her to the health warning which had been issued when he saw Ms Sims with a packet of Nanna's berries - he rushed her to hospital. Since her admission her eyelids have turned yellow and she is exhibiting signs of jaundice. Ms Sims is also suffering from chronic tonsillitis and a chest infection - likely a result of her body fighting multiple infections. 'I'm massively jaundice and my liver's pretty crappy and these are the first signs of hep A from the berries,' Ms Sims revealed. Though still awaiting the definitive results of her blood tests, Ms Sims said her doctor was almost certain she had hepatitis A, news which left her in tears. The Ballarat woman said she feels betrayed by the food company, and claims she was misled over the origin of the product which she thought were Australian made. Nanna's frozen berries are what Ms Sims was consuming and are among a number of products which have been recalled . She is suffering from jaundice, evident on her eyelids, and doctors expect to formally diagnose her with hepatitis A when her blood test results return . 'I'm really angry', Ms Sims said before adding 'It's disgusting. We're in Australia - we have our own resources.' She now faces at least a week of unpaid leave from her casual job, is on heavy antibiotics and can't even kiss her partner. Ms Sims said she was beside herself when she found out, especially since she and partner Trevor visited his sick mother in hospital just last week. She hopes that she did not pass on any virus. The Ballarat woman decided to share her story in the hopes of alerting others of the dangers. 'I thought I'm going to tell someone … if I didn't know about it then how many other people don't know,' she revealed. In recent days the frozen berry products have been pulled from supermarket shelves after increasing numbers of people contracted the potentially deadly hepatitis A virus after consuming the fruit. The first items to be pulled were 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries after five adults, three in Victoria and two in NSW, fell ill after eating the fruit. Ms Sims now faces at least a week of unpaid leave from her casual job, is on heavy antibiotics and can't even kiss her partner Trevor (left) who rushed her to hospital on Sunday night . The Ballarat woman said she feels betrayed by the company, and would not have bought the fruit had she known it wasn't made in Australia . On Sunday Patties Foods also recalled a number of their products, the 300 gram and 500 gram varieties of their Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. Patties Foods CEO Steven Chaur said the wider recall was a precautionary measure until the results of further laboratory testing came back. 'We have decided that all our frozen Mixed Berries should be recalled until such time as we receive the results of further laboratory tests,' Mr Chaur said. 'The recall is an important step to ensure public safety and confidence.' The berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores, are packed in China and distributed in Australia by Patties Foods, based in Bairnsdale in southeast Victoria. Meantime Australian farmers say the outbreak from frozen the berries imported from China illustrates the risks involved with imported food and called on consumers to always buy homegrown products. Victorian Farmers Federation president Peter Tuohey said not all imported food adhered to Australia's strict guidelines which were some of the best health and safety standards in the world. Mr Tuohey urged consumers to always buy Australian made products but conceded identifying those products could be quite challenging. Australian farmers urge consumers to always buy homegrown products . 'I can only assume that this company is using Chinese berries because they are offering a lower market price,' he told The Herald Sun. 'Berries are certainly in season in Australia.' He said that it was likely the berries were contaminated when they were first picked. 'They may have been placed on the ground where rats and other vermin could have caused the problem,' he said. 'Unfortunately, Australian Customs don't test every batch, they only check a certain percentage of shipments.' The health department has also told the company to recall the product that contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile.

Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, says frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past. 'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday. 'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.' NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch director Dr Vicky Shepherd said an investigation by all health agencies would help determine how many people have been affected - although some may not be struck down with the infection for a few weeks.

It is possible  the severe wind chills and sub-zero temperatures that swept across the US over the weekend could have affected packages left on recipients' doorsteps, or slowed down deliveries.

"This shocking video has revealed the abuse endured by a police officer who was able to remain calm in the face of extreme provocation by a gang of young thugs. Pc Richard Allen was subjected to a barrage of abuse and threats as his colleague searched one of the youths at a bus stop in Plymouth, Devon. The incident was filmed by one of the gang, who posted the video on Facebook last Thursday, and the footage is now being investigated by police. Scroll down for video . A shocking video has revealed the abuse endured by police constable Richard Allen, who was able to remain calm in the face of extreme provocation by a gang of young thugs - who filmed the incident . Pc Allen has been widely praised for his self-control despite being told by the unidentified cameraman to 'jog on you mug', and called a 'little f****** perv'. The scale of the threats made to Pc Allen have provided an insight of the vile abuse and threats on-the-beat officers endure on an almost daily basis. In the clip, which has gone viral, the unidentified cameraman can be heard shouting: 'You want to watch your back, mate. 'You're in Estover - things happen round here. Bad things, mate. People go walkabouts, mate. 'You're not wanted here. Jog on, you little mug. Get back in your bacon mobile and drive off. 'You're on minimum wage, you little bum. You're working for me.' He finally is heard calling the officer a 'little f*****g perv'. But the calm officer simply replies 'ok' throughout the stream of abuse, warns the youth about his language and continues with his job, adding 'I'm going to ask you politely, can you stand on the pavement,' as he walks back to the police patrol car. Pc  Allen was subjected to a barrage of abuse and threats as his colleague searched one of the youths at this bus stop in Plymouth, Devon . Pc Allen said after the search, he and his colleague, a special constable, left the youths to go about their day. No arrests were made. 'I didn't want the situation to escalate when it could potentially turn into a fight between six people,' he said of the video. 'I was with a special constable  who was conducting a search for the first time. 'We knew [the person filming the incident] and so we wanted to visit him another time when there were less people around and things were calmer,' said the officer of six years. 'There was no-one present at the time who was being caused harassment, distress or alarm. 'There were no children or elderly people around so I knew I could visit the person another time.' Pc Allen (left) said after the search, he and his colleague, a special constable, (right) left the youths to go about their day. No arrests were made . After his interlude with the youths, Pc Allen went on to demonstrate the other side of police work when he chased an apprehended an armed robber who had targeted a shop with a knife in an unrelated incident. A police spokesman said the footage was now being investigated. 'Unfortunately we have a small minority of people who are abusive to the police and we understand some people will be shocked watching the video and wonder why he wasn't arrested,' he said. 'An officer has to use their judgement and take account of a number of factors. 'The individual doing the filming is known to police. The officer was aware he was being filmed and that he was being deliberately goaded to react for the benefit of the video. 'I can confirm this incident is subject to a police enquiry and action will be taken against this individual. Just because action isn't taken at the time does not mean it is the end of the matter. 'Unfortunately I can't comment further on this incident, but it was important to provide some context.' The incident occurred in the Estover area of Plymouth (pictured), and the footage was uploaded to Facebook last week .","Pc Richard Allen faced barrage of abuse as colleague carried out a search .

"A video of a young George Osborne advising voters how to use ‘clever financial products’ to avoid taxes has been unearthed. In the clip, recorded on BBC's Daily Politics in 2003, Mr Osborne smirks as he advises a caller to the show how to cut inheritance tax bills and avoid paying for old age care. Mr Osborne even admits that he ‘probably shouldn’t be advocating this on television’. Scroll down for video . A young George Osborne advising voters how to use ‘clever financial products’ to avoid taxes has been unearthed . Mr Osborne said: 'There are some pretty clever financial products which enable you to - in effect - pass on your home, or the value of your home, to your son or daughter and then get personal care paid for by the state. 'I probably shouldn't be advocating this on television.' The revelation comes amid an ongoing political row over tax dodging in the wake of bombshell allegations that HSBC helped wealthy individuals stash their money in its Swiss banking arm. A list of thousands of British-linked individuals with bank accounts in Switzerland was leaked – including a number of high profile Tory donors. Labour said the Government had turned a blind eye to tax avoidance – and accused David Cameron of being ‘a dodgy Prime Minister surrounded by dodgy donors’. A party source said the video of Mr Osborne advocating ways to dodge taxes exposed the Conservative Party’s hypocrisy. A Labour source said: 'We already knew that David Cameron and George Osborne were turning a blind eye to tax avoidance. Now we learn the Chancellor has been advising people how to do it.' In the video Mr Osborne, who was a backbench MP at the time of the recording, hands out advice to a viewer called Bill. In the clip, recorded on BBC's Daily Politics in 2003, Mr Osborne smirks as he advises a viewer who rings  the show how to cut inheritance tax bills and avoid paying for old age care . Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (right) said it was 'a matter of good housekeeping' to get a receipt for cash-in-hand jobs following Ed Balls's remarks . It comes after Labour's Ed Balls said tax avoidance was such a widespread problem families should make sure they get a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs - even if they are only for £10. His remarks sparked accusations that he was out of touch with ordinary small businesses. But the party's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said getting a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs was a 'matter of good housekeeping' and was a 'good thing to do'. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the demand was 'absurd'. Tory minister Iain Duncan Smith said Mr Balls's demand for people to get a receipt for someone charging £10 to trim a hedge was 'absurd' He said: 'I don't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process; in other words, if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business, then of course I suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record, that's the right thing to do. 'But if you have a one-off payment for something and you pay cash, I shouldn't think anybody in the country does that necessarily ... what it exemplifies is Labour's complete lack of understanding about how business works and, actually, how people get by.' He told BBC Breakfast: 'Here we have a man that would be the chancellor who is wandering around saying Big Brother is going to watch you carefully, that if you do any cash transactions and don't keep receipts, somehow they are going to punish you. I find that absurd.' The shadow chancellor's comments came as Labour and the Tories engaged in furious clashes over tax dodging, with both sides complaining of smears. As he was pressed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics about what constituted tax avoidance, Mr Balls said: 'The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them.' Asked whether he himself followed that rule, he said: 'Absolutely. That's because I am the shadow chancellor and I'm extremely careful about these things. 'Over my life, have I ever given people a tenner and not given a receipt for it? Probably yes. But he had not done so 'since I have been involved in politics and Treasury matters'. Mr Balls said: 'It's not your job to pay their taxes for them and I think most people you give a tenner to are not going to be VAT-registered. 'They've got the legal obligation to make sure they pay their taxes if it's that kind of transaction - but I think the sensible thing for anybody is that you've got a record of it and you've done it properly.'","Clip featuring Mr Osborne was recorded for BBC's Daily Politics in 2003 .

"As Australia's greyhound racing industry goes into damage control mode after it was revealed that the sport's top trainers were tying live piglets, possums and rabbits to mechanical lures and using them as live bait to train the dogs, another trainer has been suspended and three inquiries have been launched. A tale of horror and death was told by ABC's Four Corners program on Monday night, revealing irrefutable evidence of live baiting during secretly filmed training sessions. The live piglets, possums and rabbits were strapped to lures before being sent around the private tracks before being chased and killed by dogs. Six NSW greyhound trainers, 10 in Victoria and several in Queensland, have stood down after property inspections by the RSPCA. One of the men stood down - Paul Anderton - was a former steward for Greyhound Racing Victoria. Scroll down for video . A trainer holds his greyhound as it rips into a rabbit tied to a mechanical lure in footage shown on the ABC . Greyhound Racing Victoria Chairman Peter Caillard arrives at a media conference to announce a full investigation will be launched into the live baiting claims . A possum is ripped to pieces by a greyhound during a live baiting session at a track . A piglet hangs from a lure before it his sent hurtling around the greyhound track . On Tuesday, Greyhound Racing NSW chief executive Brent Hogan said NSW trainer John Thompson had also been suspended in the wake of the report. Comment was being sought from Mr Thompson, who is reportedly based in the state's north, at Shannon Brook. 'John Thompson was stood down last night,' Mr Hogan told Fairfax Radio. 'We only became aware of John Thompson's involvement through the broadcast last night. 'He's registered in NSW, he's been suspended and we're now working with Racing Queensland in relation to that matter.' In the show, two-time Australian Greyhound Trainer of the Year Darren McDonald, who has won more than $4 million in prize money, was filmed tying a terrified piglet to a mechanical lure to be savaged by dogs. Another long-time successful trainer, Tom Noble, was filmed taking a baby possum from its mother so the mother could be used for live baiting. The Racing Integrity Commissioner Sal Perna believes the live baiting is probably an isolated incident . Greyhound Racing NSW chief executive Brent Hogan said NSW trainer John Thompson had also been suspended in the wake of the report . A greyhound grabs a piglet by its hind leg as it it whips by on a mechanical lure . On Tuesday, GRNSW announced that a taskforce headed by former High Court justice Michael McHugh would investigate live baiting in the industry. Mr Hogan has called for greater powers to stamp out animal cruelty in the industry. The allegations of animal cruelty come as the NSW government oversees a scheduled five-year statutory review of the Greyhound Racing Act 2009. In light of the report, the Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing has extended the time for submissions for a further two weeks, until March 2. NSW opposition leader Luke Foley has called for an urgent, independent investigation to root out the 'bad apples' in the industry, and urged life bans. NSW Greens MP John Kaye is urging GRNSW to be broken up for failing to detect live baiting. Meanwhile, Victoria's racing integrity commissioner believes the illegal practice of live baiting is isolated in the greyhound industry. A rabbit with its ears pinned back in terror is strapped to a mechanical lure before the greyhounds appear . Sal Perna says the allegations of live baiting aired in an ABC report were a shock and he was only aware of one instance, which was disproved, in his five years in the job. Mr Perna says the extent of the practice isn't known. 'My guess is that it is isolated but I really don't know yet,' he told reporters on Tuesday. He says he will investigate the extent of the problem. Mr Perna said he would conduct a wide-ranging inquiry. 'I want to talk to people in the industry who know about this - whether it's current, or whether it's historical, or whether this is isolated or not.' He said it would be premature to stop greyhound racing when the extent of the problem was not known. Twenty-three greyhound industry participants in Victoria, NSW and Queensland have been stood down for allegedly being involved in live baiting. Mr Perna said reform was needed to stop trainers getting around sanctions by transferring ownership of dogs to relatives. Former Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting celebrates a win for his greyhound trained by Darren McDonald. Mr Ponting has no connection whatsoever with live baiting . 'If it doesn't have any effect because they can move a dog over to someone else and continue to be doing what they did, they're not working and they need to be addressed,' he said of sanctions. Tasmania has also promised to review animal welfare processes in its greyhound industry following the Four Corners expose that highlighted the use of live bait in other states. Tasmania's minister for racing says the revelations aired on Monday night by ABC's Four Corners were horrifying. 'The use of live bait is illegal, disgusting and totally unacceptable. This is an extremely serious animal welfare crime,' Jeremy Rockliff Rockliff said in a statement on Tuesday. 'The Tasracing chief executive officer Dr Eliot Forbes has today assured that there is no evidence to date that this abhorrent practice is occurring in Tasmania.' Mr Rockliff has since directed the Chief Veterinary Officer and the Director of Racing to review Tasmania's arrangements for animal welfare in the greyhound racing industry. In Tasmania, live baiting currently attracts a fine up to $28,000 and imprisonment of up to 18 months. Animal rights activist Hayley Cotton said what they discovered on the secret footage was brutal. AFL great Tony Lockett holds his dog after it wins for himself and trainer Darren McDonald. Mr Lockett has no connection at all with live baiting . 'On the tapes was probably the most horrific cruelty that you would ever come across involving dogs and animals,' she told the ABC on Monday. Scores of owners and trainers including some of the biggest names in the business were shown secretly blooding their dogs with live bait. 'It's a practice that they believe will give their dogs a distinct advantage over other competitors not exposed to the practice, for the simple reason that their blood lust is up,' Four Corners presenter Kerry O'Brien explained. However, it's the cheating that is maybe the worst thing as hundreds of thousands of punters bet more than $4 billion a year on greyhound racing, but what most of them don't know is that this illegal activity is taking place. Two famous greyhound owners are former Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting and St Kilda and Sydney Swans AFL great, Tony Lockett. Both were pictured in the program with their winning greyhounds that were trained by Mr McDonald. However, they would have had absolutely no connection with Mr McDonald's cruel methods. A rabbit twitches before dying while strapped to a mechanical lure after being savaged by a greyhound . 'Darren McDonald's dogs have won millions of dollars in prize money, so I'm sure there'll be people without and within the racing industry who'll be questioning whether his winning advantage has been gained through illegal and quite horrific live baiting training practices,' Lyn White of Animals Australia said. Tracking dogs and their trainers from private training facilities and on to official race meets and using undercover investigators to infiltrate the industry, the Four Corners program discovered the integrity of potentially thousands of races and millions of dollars in prize money is now in question. Live baiting has been banned and criminalised for decades. Those found guilty of it can face up to two years in jail and a life ban from greyhound racing, but at tracks at New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria the practice was obviously still thriving. Greyhound trainers let their dog attack a rabbit that has been kept on a leash so it can't run away . Rabbits are kept in a cage before being taking out and strapped to a mechanical lure at a greyhound track . Greyhounds Australasia CEO Scott Parker said an independent review of all systems relating to animal welfare and integrity would be run in the wake of the allegations. He said live baiting was 'abhorrent'. Greyhound Racing NSW chief steward Clint Bentley said the decision to stand down the trainers was made because of the seriousness of the allegations against them. 'While the investigations are only beginning, the allegations are of such a serious nature that we felt it imperative to suspend the five participants immediately,' Mr Bentley said in a statement on Friday. Greyhound Racing Victoria Chief Executive Adam Wallish said 10 people had been suspended over the allegations. 'The use of live bait in the training of greyhounds is disgusting and has no place in our sport,' Mr Wallish said in a statement. 'Any person engaged in live baiting can expect to be disqualified and prosecuted. We have zero tolerance for these individuals.' Mr Wallish confirmed that live baiting is a criminal offence punishable under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986 and can attract a jail term of up to two years and a fine of more than $30,000.

"Nato has sounded a warning after 26 Russian bombers, tankers and fighter jets on military exercises were intercepted around Europe in just 24 hours. Jets were scrambled by the RAF and allies in Germany, Portugal and Turkey after the 'unusual' spike in activity, which saw two giant Tu-95 Bear H bombers fly close to Britain yesterday. The alliance said Russia had conducted 'significant military manoeuvres in European airspace' - though it then added none of the planes had strayed into any specific country's territory. Closely watched: RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled yesterday to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers. Some 26 intercepts were made in around 24 hours, said Nato . The two Bear bombers had been part of an eight-plane formation which was first intercepted by Norwegian F-16s over at 2am yesterday. While six of the planes returned back towards Russia, the two Bears carried on south west towards the UK where they were picked up by RAF Boulmer, Northumberland. Chiefs the scrambled Typhoon jets from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, northern Scotland, which tracked the Bear bombers as they continued through Britain's 'flight information region'. Nato said: 'The bomber and tanker aircraft from Russia did not file flight plans or maintain radio contact with civilian air traffic control authorities and they were not using on-board transponders. 'This poses a potential risk to civil aviation as civilian air traffic control cannot detect these aircraft or ensure there is no interference with civilian air traffic.' Followed: These images were all issued by the RAF and showed the moment the aircraft were escorted by Typhoon jets near British airspace . Nato stepped up defences and said: 'These sizeable Russian flights represent an unusual level of air activity over European airspace' The Bear bombers which flew near Britain (one is pictured) were just two of 26 Russian planes intercepted over Europe in 24 hours .

The British Typhoon pilots identified the Bear bombers visually and 'escorted' them around the edge of British airspace, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. The Bears then continued towards the Atlantic to the west of Portugal, where they were intercepted by Portuguese F-16s before turning back. They appeared to be heading back to Russia but were still airborne by 3pm. Nato said the 'sizeable Russian flights' represented an 'unusual level of air activity over European airspace.' But the alliance added that all the planes intercepted were, in legal terms, still in international airspace. Russian bombers and jets were also intercepted over the Baltic and Black Seas between Tuesday and yesterday afternoon. Some 26 interceptions were made in the space of just 24 hours, although seven could have been the same planes returning to the same area. More than 100 Russian planes have been intercepted by Nato this year - triple the number in the whole of last year. The movements come after months of heightened tension between Moscow and the West following Russia's annexation of Crimea and military incursion into Ukraine. Nato's new chief said today the alliance is increasing its readiness and air policing after yesterday's flurry of activity. Jens Stoltenberg said that while Nato is not back on a Cold War footing with Russia, its former arch-enemy as the Soviet Union, recent behaviour has severely undermined mutual trust. Mr Stoltenberg said the trans-Atlantic military alliance 'remains vigilant and ready to respond'. 'We need to keep our forces ready, therefore we are investing in high readiness, new capabilities,' he said. 'We are... increasing air policing as an answer to the increased air activities we are seeing from Russia.' He also urged Russia to remove its forces from Ukraine - Russia denies they are there - and warned against plans by pro-Russian separatists to hold local elections in eastern Ukraine.

A Russian Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber - the same model which flew close to Britain yesterday - refuels over an unknown location during a military exercise (file pic) The interceptions yesterday were unrelated to a sonic boom caused by RAF fighter jets which shocked residents across Kent. Typhoons from RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, flew to Kent at supersonic speeds to dramatically halt a Latvian cargo plane on its way to Birmingham after it 'caused concern' to air traffic controllers. The swoop, which resulted in the Lativan-registered plane being grounded at Stansted airport yesterday evening, sparked a massive sonic boom which was heard across a 50-mile radius. Soon after the incident, an unverified audio clip was posted online which appeared to have recorded the moment an RAF pilot warned the plane it risked being 'shot down'. A man was heard saying: 'I’m instructed by Her Majesty’s government of the United Kingdom to warn you if you do not respond you will be shot down’. The incidents happened on the same day Kent was rocked by a sonic boom as a Latvian cargo plane was intercepted, but were unrelated . Grounded: The Latvian Antonov An-26 cargo airliner (pictured) was escorted into Stansted Airport after causing a brief scare yesterday . The interceptions were also not said to be linked to another huge sonic boom heard yesterday over the Outer Hebrides. The blasts rattled buildings and left islanders shaken from Benbecula and Barra, a distance of more than 55 miles. At first locals thought there had been a blast at a local quarry or military ordnance blown up at a beach - but the RAF later said it was 'most likely a supersonic jet belonging to the RAF or US Air Force on a routine training flight'. A spokesman added: 'These flights take place all the time around the UK and we don’t announce them. To hear a supersonic boom is rare. However in certain climatic conditions they can be heard and this is what most likely happened in this case. It was probably us.' Sheila MacCormick, of the Borrodale Hotel in South Uist, said: 'The actual building shook. When we looked out there was people walking on the road - who were standing looking around to see what had happened.' The exercise is a rebuke to Nato, which was founded as a Cold War-era defence body in 1949, less than a week after it insisted the Russia still had troops in eastern Ukraine. Russia strenuously denies the claims - but Nato said although it has withdrawn 'partially' it still maintains a capable force on the border. U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, Nato's top military commander, told reporters: 'Make no mistake, there remain Russian . forces inside eastern Ukraine.' Some Russian troops stationed near the Ukraine border had . left and some others appeared to be preparing to leave, he said. 'But the . force that remains and shows no indications of leaving is still . a very, very capable force and remains a coercive capability to . the nation of Ukraine.'","26 Russian aircraft ran 'military manoeuvres' in 24 hours including two Bear bombers followed by RAF fighters .

"When a Jewish woman wanted a divorce from an unwilling husband, federal prosecutors say Mendel Epstein was the rabbi who  could gather a kidnap team to make it happen. New Jersey prosecutors allege Epstein's team would use brutal methods, including martial arts beatings, handcuffs and electric cattle prods, to torture the man into granting the divorce. 'If it can get a bull that weighs 5 tons to move, you put it in certain parts of his body and in one minute the guy will know,' prosecutors said the Orthodox rabbi told a pair of undercover FBI agents posing as a brother and sister trying to force the sister's husband to grant the ritual Jewish divorce known as a 'get.' Prosecutors say he was recorded telling the agents the operation would cost at least $50,000. Fixer? Rabbi Mendel Epstein, pictured, allegedly could gather a kidnap team to make unwilling Jewish husbands grant their wives divorces . Investigation:  FBI agents are seen removing evidence from the Brooklyn residence of Rabbi Mendel Epstein (October 2013 file photo) The kidnap team brought surgical blades, a screwdriver and rope to a staged kidnapping in 2013, according to the indictment. Epstein, who was indicted last May along with his son and three other Orthodox rabbis, told the undercover agents he arranged similar kidnappings every year or year and a half, the indictment said. Epstein's trial on attempted kidnapping charges starts Wednesday in federal court in Trenton. It was initially scheduled to begin Tuesday but was pushed back because of a snowstorm. Several co-defendants have pleaded guilty in the case; others will go on trial with Epstein. The charges against Epstein reveal how far some Jewish women are forced to go to obtain a get, which Jewish law says the woman needs to remarry or even date another man. Defense lawyer Robert Stahl called Epstein a 'champion of women's rights.' Epstein wrote the 1989 book 'A Woman's Guide to the Get Process.' 'I think that a lot of information will come out about the supposed victims, and the evidence will not be there that he was involved in certain incidents,' Stahl said. 'Much more will come to light once the trial gets underway.' Methods: Prosecutors allege Epstein's team would use brutal methods, including martial arts beatings, handcuffs and electric cattle prods, to torture the man into granting the divorce . Epstein is free on bail. No one answered the door last week at his two-story house in Lakewood, a 25-square-mile community near the Jersey shore where more than 60,000 Orthodox Jews reside. The allegations against Epstein show the lengths to which an agunah — a Jewish woman whose husband will not give the get — will go for a divorce. 'Without having the get ... I have no prospects of getting remarried. I cannot date men. I have no future of having more children,' said Rivky Stein, a 25-year-old Brooklyn woman who says she is trying to obtain a get from her husband but isn't involved in the Epstein case. 'It just literally locks you in. You're just entirely chained, and, in a sense, you're controlled.' The problem of recalcitrant husbands in the Jewish faith is dealt with in a few ways but can be complicated in the U.S., said Rabbi Mark Dratch, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America. In Israel, he said, husbands who refuse to grant divorces can be imprisoned. Because that can't happen in the United States, communities sometimes exert social pressure on the husband. 'It's embarrassing to the individual and to the community,' he said, noting that he doesn't condone the violence alleged in the Epstein case. 'It's not such a thing we're proud of.' Stein said she doesn't pardon any crimes Epstein may have committed but has called for the Jewish community to come up with a solution to what she said is a problem of men 'distorting Judaism.' 'Do I condone it? No. But I understand these women,' she said. 'I understand their desperation. I understand their pain.""

"A Southern California teen fatally shot himself early Monday morning in front of his family after telling his cousins he was going to play Russian roulette, authorities say. The 17-year-old boy allegedly put the .38 Special revolver to his head and pulled the trigger while his cousins begged him 'not to do it,' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez told the Los Angeles Times. In Russian roulette, a revolver is loaded with one bullet and participants take turns putting the gun to their heads and pulling the trigger. Russian roulette: Police responded around 4 a.m. Monday morning to reports of a shooting and found a 17-year-old boy bleeding from a single gunshot wound . NBC4 reports security guard Donald Gordon responded to reports from neighbors of screaming that lasted a minute, followed by a gunshot. 'He was on the ground, gasping for air, saying he really needs some help,' Gordon said, after he found the teenager bleeding on the ground. Police arrived around 4 a.m., after which the boy was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to the sheriff's department. The teenager reportedly lived with his older brother and sister-in-law at the Harbor Cove apartment complex in Torrance. 'They were pleading with him not to play with the gun, not to play Russian roulette,' said sheriff's department Sgt Scott Hoglund. 'The victim did not listen and proceeded to put the gun to his head and pull the trigger,' Hoglund added. Police say they recovered the gun from the scene and are trying to find whose name the gun is registered under. 'Additional information about the weapon is still under investigation,' the department said in a statement. Family members told NBC4 they did not know how the boy had gotten hold of a gun.","The teenager pulled out a gun and announced to his cousins he was going to play Russian roulette in his room at an apartment complex in Torrance .

"An increase in suspected Russian spying activity is raising fears of a return to the Soviet-style espionage seen in the Cold War. In Poland a high-ranking military officer was recently arrested for spying while in the  Czech Republic, security services warn of a rise in the number of foreign intelligence officers operating out of Prague's embassies. Their concerns were shared around Europe on Wednesday after 26 Russian bombers, tankers and fighter jets on military exercises were intercepted across the continent in just 24 hours. And yesterday, RAF Typhoons intercepted a Russian Bear bomber again as it approached UK airspace in a manoeuvre similar to that witnessed earlier in the week. Scroll down for video . Espionage incident: Spy agency officers in Poland escort a man suspected of spying in front of the district court in Warsaw last month . An RAF spokesman said the Russian aircraft was picked up by the RAF Control and Reporting Centre at Boulmer in Northumberland, . She added: 'Following a similar incident on Wednesday October 29, the RAF Typhoon pilots visually identified the Russian aircraft and escorted them through the UK flight information region.' The extraordinary incidents follow months of heightened tensions between Moscow and the West following Russia's annexation of Crimea and military incursion into Ukraine. In Poland a high-ranking military officer was recently accused of passing information to Russian security forces. Officers from Poland's domestic security agency, ABW, descended on the country's defence ministry in Warsaw to arrest the lieutenant-colonel. A lawyer, with contacts throughout Polish government, was also taken into custody on spying charges, The Financial Times reports. Sending a message: One Polish MP said the arrests were intended to show Russian security forces that Poland should not be seen as an easy target for obtaining intelligence on EU or Nato strategy . Gromoslaw Czempinski, a former head of Poland's security service, said: 'Activity is higher, for certain. It is to be expected. 'There is tension between Russia and Europe, and they would obviously like to know much more about sanctions, relations between countries.' One  Polish MP said the arrests were intended to send a message to Russian security forces - that Poland should not be seen as an easy target for obtaining intelligence on EU or Nato strategy. The Bear bombers which flew near Britain (one is pictured) were just two of 26 Russian planes intercepted over Europe in 24 hours . Piotr Niemczyk, a former deputy director of the Polish intelligence services, told the Financial Times: 'We do not want this kind of spying activity in Warsaw. We want to show that we will not tolerate it. This is the point of the game.' This week it was also claimed that the Russian government was behind a series of cyber attacks on Polish government ministries - an allegation Moscow has denied. The Czech secret service has also warned that Russia placed an 'extremely high' number of intelligence officers at its Prague embassy in 2013 - in a bif to increase its influence in the country.

This photo, released by the Norwegian Air Force, shows a Norwegian Air Force F-16AM Fighting Falcon (left) accompanying a Russian Air Force Tupolev Tu-95MS (right) On Wednesday, Russia sent 26 bombers, tankers and fighter jets on military exercises around Europe - sparking widespread concern. Jets were scrambled by the RAF and allies in Germany, Portugal and Turkey after the 'unusual' spike in activity, which saw two giant Tu-95 Bear H bombers fly close to Britain yesterday. Nato said Russia had conducted 'significant military manoeuvres in European airspace' - though it then added none of the planes had strayed into any specific country's territory. British Typhoon pilots identified Russian Bear bombers visually and 'escorted' them around the edge of British airspace, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. The Bears then continued towards the Atlantic to the west of Portugal, where they were intercepted by Portuguese F-16s before turning back. In 2010 11 people were arrested by the FBI and accused of spying for Russia. The group was accused of using invisible ink, short-wave radios, steganography and wi-fi in cafés to pass coded messages back to Russia - including information on nuclear weapons.","High-ranking Polish military official recently arrested for spying for Russia .

"A  father stabbed to death his transgender daughter at their Ohio home  before telling a 911 dispatcher that she was 'in a cult' and had been attacked by fellow members, police have said. Kevin Golec, 52, allegedly knifed 22-year-old artist and drummer Bri Golec after they got into an argument over money at their house in Inman Street, Akron, at around 10pm last Friday. He then called 911 and reportedly told a series of lies to cover his crime. 'He's [Bri's] in a cult and all this s***. These guys came in. I fought them off. They got him,' he told the operator. Police arrived at the scene  and discovered Bri lying unresponsive near the side door of the house with a  stabbing wound to her neck. She was rushed to hospital, where she was declared dead. Scroll down for video . Killing: Kevin Golec (right), 52, stabbed to death his transgender daughter, Bri Golec (left), at their Ohio home before telling a 911 dispatcher that she was 'in a cult' and had been attacked by fellow members, police said . Scene: Golec allegedly knifed 22-year-old artist and drummer Bri  after they got into an argument at the house they were living at (pictured) in Inman Street, Akron, at around 10pm last Friday. She was later declared dead . Now, Golec has been arrested on murder and domestic violence charges. He is currently being held at the Summit County Jail and is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday, according to ABC 5. In the hours after the killing, many local news outlets reported on the incident, but referred to Bri as 'Brian'. Her mother, Christine Hamblin, and fiancée, Sarah Price, also used male pronouns. Although Bri's gender identity remains disputed, Jacob Nash, the head of an Akron-based support group for transgender people, has since confirmed the victim was a transgender woman. Speaking to the Akron Beacon Journal, he said: 'I'm just devastated by the fact that this young woman who had so much potential and so much ahead of her... her life was cut short.' 'She had come to the support group several years ago and started coming back again  recently.' He added that he was not sure what  Golec had meant by 'cult' in his 911 call, during which the alleged killer cried 'Oh my God' several times and accused 'cult' members of storming the house. Drummer: After killing Bri (pictured), Golec called 911 and told a series of lies to cover his crime, police said. 'He's [Bri's] in a cult and all this s***. These guys came in. I fought them off.

Her mother, Christine Hamblin (pictured with Bri when she was a child), also used male pronouns . Victim: Although the victim's (pictured) gender identity remains disputed, Jacob Nash, the head of an Akron-based support group for transgender people, has since declared the victim was a transgender woman . 'I don't know if that was geared toward the transgender community or not,' said Mr Nash. The Columbus-based group, TransOhio, also paid tribute to Tri in a statement that it released on Sunday, saying: 'Please keep our Akron trans community in your thoughts and prayers.' Police Lieutenant Rick Edwards said the force was unaware of Bri's transgender status, but added that it was not a factor in the stabbing, which occurred in the 1100 block of Inman Street. He said Golec had drug issues and had been taking money from the family. The troubled father had moved into the house Bri shared with Miss Price in a bid to 'reconnect' with her, relatives said. Distraught: On Saturday, Ms Hamblin (pictured) paid tribute to her daughter, a former Coventry High School, Connecticut, student who played in band and apparently dreamed of studying biomedical engineering . Fiancee: Bri's fiancee, Sarah Price (pictured), described the victim as a 'beautiful soul' and 'my soul mate' Musical: Bri (pictured), whose interests included 'painting, jewelry making, meditation, martial arts, video games, and anime', was ruled to have died from a neck stab wound by the Summit County Medical Examiner . On Saturday, Ms Hamblin paid tribute to her daughter, a former Coventry High School, Connecticut, student who played in a band and apparently dreamed of studying biomedical engineering. Referring to Bri as her 'son', she said: He cared more for other people than he did himself. It's just so heartbreaking for me.' Miss Price described Bri as a 'beautiful soul' and 'my soul mate'. In an email to Raw Story, Geoff Ackerman, Bri's friend and fellow Murphy's Children band member, also disputed claims the victim was transgender, writing: 'Did Brian at one time identify as Bri? Yes. 'However, within the last year or so, he identified as Brian, and if I had to put a label on him (something he would hate, by the way), he would identify as an androgynous pansexual man.' Raising money: Bri's family and friends have set up a GoFundMe page to pay for expenses. On the page, the victim is listed as 'Brian'. She is the sixth transgender individual to have suffered a violent death in 2015 . A family obituary also lists Bri - who was first labeled transgender in the context of her killing by LGBT blog Pittsburg Lesbian Correspondents - as 'Brian' and uses male pronouns throughout.

"Chuka Umunna yesterday refused five times to say Labour would hand back money if a donor was found to have used aggressive tax avoidance. The party’s business spokesman dodged the question repeatedly by insisting he was ‘not aware’ of any such donation. He even refused to rule out Labour accepting the money if it knew in advance that a donor was aggressively avoiding tax, saying only that the party would ‘think twice’ before saying yes. Chuka Umunna yesterday refused five times to say Labour would hand back money if a donor was found to have used aggressive tax avoidance . His comments came as details emerged of how unions which handed millions to Labour pay no corporation tax on millions of pounds of investment income. Despite criticising tax avoidance by corporations and wealthy individuals, trade unions exploited a little-known loophole to avoid paying millions in corporation tax last year. Tory MPs seized on the revelations to accuse the unions of ‘financial trickery’ and demand Ed Miliband return the union donations. Between them, the Labour-affiliated unions Unite, UNISON, GMB and USDAW made nearly £15million on investments worth a total of £223million last year. Ed Miliband, Ed Balls (second right), Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Caroline Flint (left) and Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna (right), during a visit to Jaguar Land Rover yesterday . But they paid no tax on this income, which if it was taxed at the main corporation tax rate of 21 per cent would have netted the Exchequer some £3.1million. Unions insisted they were not liable for corporation tax because of a legal exemption for unions. But Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘This is yet more straight-up hypocrisy from Ed Miliband. He tried to sound tough on tax, now it turns out his biggest donors are tax avoiders. This is an edited transcript of Chuka Umunna’s interview by James Naughtie: . JN: Can we take it that if you discover that anyone who’s given money to the Labour Party has been involved in aggressive tax avoidance, you give the money back? CU: I think the Labour Party would think twice about accepting money from people who fit the description you give... JN: No, simple question: If you’ve taken it, will you give the money back? CU: Well I’m not aware that we have taken money from anybody who’s engaged... JN: No, but if it emerged, would you give that money back? CU: Well as I said, I think if Labour found out somebody was engaged in aggressive tax avoidance, it would think twice before taking the money... JN: But if you had taken the money, you’d give it back? CU: I’m not aware that we have taken it... JN: Answer the question. If the money came from a tax dodger, would you give it back? CU: Well I’m not aware that it has, that we have received any monies from people engaging in aggressive tax avoidance. ‘Hardworking taxpayers can’t get away with this financial trickery, so why should Ed Miliband and his donors?’ Last week Mr Miliband attacked David Cameron as ‘dodgy’ over donations to the Tories from alleged tax avoiders. But since then questions have emerged about the tax affairs of a string of Labour donors. Mr Umunna was quizzed by Jim Naughtie on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday. He was asked if it was an ‘absolute given’ that if party bosses were to discover that a donor was involved in aggressive tax avoidance they would give the money back. Mr Umunna repeatedly avoided answering the ‘hypothetical question’, saying he was ‘not aware’ of anyone who was accused of tax avoidance. Details of unions’ investment income and tax payments are based on figures provided to the Certification Officer, who audits union affairs. Figures for 2013 show Unite made £2.8million on an investment of £51.3million but its return states that corporation tax is payable only on investment income which exceeds ‘expenditure on provident benefits’. Unison made £298,000 on an investment of £114.2million, but its annual return said no corporation tax was payable ‘because of relief available’. USDAW made nearly £10million on an investment of £40.2million and the GMB £1.7million on £17.3million. Since Mr Miliband became Labour leader the same four unions have donated a total of £30.6million to the party. The union tax loophole is contained within the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which allows them to offset costs such as sick pay, accident compensation and employment tribunal costs against income. Ed Miliband suffered a fresh blow yesterday – after ‘staunchly Labour’ TV stars Ant and Dec (pictured) attacked his leadership and questioned whether they could vote for him. Declan Donnelly, 39, said he had always voted Labour but was unimpressed with Mr Miliband. He said: ‘I’m not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.’ Ant McPartlin, also 39, said the pair were ‘staunchly Labour’ but didn’t know if they could vote Labour under Mr Miliband. They also told The Times that they followed politics ‘keenly’ but were disillusioned with both Labour and the Coalition.","Labour party’s business spokesman dodged the question repeatedly .

Scroll down for video . Brisbane teacher Natalie Lawler has been selected as one of the 100 global finalists who are vying to become part of the four-person team to head off on the first mission to live on the Red Planet planned for 2024 . One of seven selected Australians, Ms Lawler's two daughters will be young adults by the time of the planned mission and believes she would remain an intregral part of their lives via satellite communication . 'I think that it's something that we can all deal with so that I will feel like I will be very much a part of their lives even though I won't have physical touch,' she said . 'I will see them again - there's satellite communication so we won't be able to have telephone conversations because of the time delay with the distance between Mars and Earth but there will be satellite communication to send videos everyday, emails and I'll learn to just parent from afar.' She said her youngest was very excited about the possibility of her mother living on another planet but her eldest was only slowly coming around to the idea. 'My eldest daughter is turning 14 and definitely in her own world of friendships and sport and to be honest doesn't show much interest at this stage but hopefully now that I've got through to round three she might become a little bit more interested', she said. 'My youngest daughter has been writing stories about space exploration and is quite excited with the prospect that we will have people living on Mars .

'If we can live in Mars we can live anywhere - it's the next giant leap for mankind' Ms Lawler says . Dianne McGrath (left) and Josh Seven (right) are one of the seven Aussies in the top 100 global finalists hoping to go to Mars . Ms Lawler said there were many reasons why she hoped to be one of the final four to be the first humans to ever  live in space. 'I think that all humans have this natural curiosity and it's the next giant leap for mankind,' she said. 'The first hole that we dig we expect to find more about Mars than we have with rovers being on the planet for the last few decades so there's the science and the sustainable living,' she said. 'If we can live on Mars we can live anywhere.' However, she said she would not enjoy the seven long months in transit to get to Mars. 'That would be quite horrific - I'm not looking forward to that part of the mission but showing the world that we can live sustainably,' she said. When questioned about the inevitably different personalities that will be part of the close knit team, Ms Lawler said that was part of the selection process. There will be eight cargo missions to show that they can land rovers and supply units and have everything set up before so that the final four leave earth  have oxygen, water and a habitat . Dr Electra Navarone (left) and (right) Gunnar Prehl will join the five other Aussies who will train for eight years before it is decided who will become the astronauts . 'Doctor Norbert Kraft who is in charge of the application process has lots of experience in choosing astronauts and he will profile us and put us in teams that we will train for eight years with,' she said. 'So we will know our team very well so if we are not compatible the teams will change or people will withdraw from the program.' The brave woman says she is well aware of the potential dangers involved with the mission. 'There's lots of risks with the mission - the benefits of the mission that Mars 1 has planned is that it's using proven technology so they are not waiting for technology to be invented to be able to make this mission a success,' she said. 'They will also do eight cargo missions to show that they can land rovers and supply units and have everything set up before people actually leave earth so we'll have oxygen, water and a habitat.' The first man mission in currently scheduled for 2024 but Ms Lawler concedes that is an ambitious time frame. 'Then the plan is to have a colony on Mars and every two years they will send another four astronauts to live on Mars, so every four years for as long as the program is a success - we'll keep sending people,' she said. Today Show host Lisa Wilkinson suggested that the mission, which will be presumably taken up with single people, will become 'Mars Tinder' and her co-host Karl Stefanovic added that the Red Planet could evolve into 'one big swingers party'. Ms Lawler laughed it off saying that she hoped the mission would become something that 'humanity can be proud of'.

Ms Alexeeva told local television: ‘When I went to look for him I found him hiding under a bush and was shocked to see a knife sticking out of his head even though he was still alive.’ She said she took the animal to the nearest vets in the Peninsula - which is the subject of territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine - where it had been surgically removed under an anaesthetic. Natalia Morozova, president of a local charity for homeless animals, said: ‘We think the cat had been stabbed on Friday 13, and had therefore been injured for some time before he was found.

"A former Navy SEAL and best-selling author has become the latest expert to question Brian Williams' claim that he was friendly with the SEAL team responsible for killing Osama Bin Laden. The embattled broadcaster, currently serving a six-month unpaid suspension, has previously claimed that he received a soldier's knife as a gift and was given a piece of the helicopter used in the 2011 operation which led to the former Al Qaeda leader's death. In a Nightly News item broadcast on May 3 2011, Williams said he had the 'great honor of flying into Baghdad with them (SEAL Team 6) at the start of the war,' a claim that ex-SEAL Brandon Webb told SOFREP is impossible. Scroll down for video . Ex-SEAL Brandon Webb, left, has rubbished a claim made by Brian Williams that he flew with SEAL Team 6 at the start of the Iraq War in 2003 - the team didn't join the war until a month later . According to Webb, whose books include The Red Circle and Benghazi: The Definitive Report, a former SEAL Team Six operator told him that they didn't enter Iraq until April - a month after the invasion had started. 'It's one thing to embellish for the sake of storytelling, but to flat-out lie about serious events in what appears to be a narcissist-fueled campaign of self-indulgence, when you are a trusted news correspondent is unacceptable, and a career ending activity,' wrote Webb. He also said that the same SEAL strongly disputed Williams' claim that he was given a piece of the stealth helicopter from the mission. 'It's tactically unsound to waste time taking pieces off the downed helo during that mission,' said the former operator who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'That helicopter was also part of a Special Access Program, so I'm one hundred percent certain that the professionals at DEVGRU (SEAL Team Six) are not going to risk imprisonment to give Brian Williams a souvenir.' The new allegations surfaced just less than a week after the 55-year-old was suspended by NBC News for six months without pay after lying about an RPG attack in Iraq. Revelations: Brian Williams openly talked about travelling with Nay SEAL Team Six the day after the raid which killed Osama Bin Laden on David Letterman. The U.S Special Operations Command has however cast doubt on his claims . Shortly after the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks was killed in a secret operation in Pakistan, Williams started talking openly about the unit in interviews claiming he had the 'honor' of flying with them when he first arrived in Baghdad. The Huffington Post reported that during an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman the day after the Bin Laden raid in 2011, Williams said: 'We have some idea which of our special operations teams carried this out. 'It happens to be a team I flew into Baghdad with, on the condition that I would never speak of what I saw on the aircraft, what aircraft we were on, what we were carrying, or who we were after.' While anchoring NBC's Nightly News the following night he said: 'Now, people might be hearing about SEAL Team 6. I happen to have the great honor of flying into Baghdad with them at the start of the war.' A year later on the chat show he claimed he flew in with the military unit on March 22, 2003, three days after the invasion. The embattled broadcaster is seen reporting from Baghdad International Airport. He claimed he arrived three days after the invasion on March 22, 2003. However he was stationed in Kuwait at the time . Stealth helicopter that Brian Williams claims he owns part of: The rotor blades of SEAL Team 6's damaged helicopter is seen lying near Osama bin Laden's compound after it was destroyed following the successful May 6 raid . However he was in Kuwait for the initial stages of the invasion and did not report from inside Iraq until April 9 - where he used a flashlight to speak to the camera. In another Late Show appearance in 2012, Williams told a soldier he admired his knife while they chatted over a box of Wheat Thins. He then told the host: 'Darned if that knife didn't show up at my office a couple weeks later.' It is allegedly one of the many memorabilia items Williams has been handed over the years - including signed sports memorabilia, autographs and a B-24 control panel from an American Second World War bomber that was recovered in a field in Great Britain . Eight years after he was gifted the weapon he described how he received an unsigned thank you note with a package containing a piece of fuselage. He claims it was from the helicopter used in the raid on Osama Bin Laden's Pakistan compound. The aircraft was blown up by the commandos after the raid, fearing it contained sensitive material that could have got into enemy hands and used against the United States. Replacement: On Wednesday night, Williams' name was taken off the Nightly News' graphics and the program's title was officially changed . In the months after the raid, John Kerry managed to secure a deal with Pakistan that saw some of the tail from the aircraft returned. United States Special Operations Command spokesman Ken McGraw told The Post Williams could only have received a piece of the helicopter after parts of it had been given back. He added: 'We do not embed journalists with this or any other unit that conducts counter-terrorism missions.' On Tuesday Williams was suspended for six months without pay after he admitted to lying about his time in Iraq. In a note sent to NBC staff, Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, described his puffed-up retellings of events from 2003 as 'wrong and completely inappropriate'. Bosses at the network finally acted after deciding Williams's own decision last week to remove himself from anchoring for 'several days' was not enough. He claimed to have been inside an aircraft when it was hit by an RPG - he was actually around one mile away. On Wednesday, the network changed the name of the broadcast from NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams to NBC Nightly News. Scandal: The newest allegations are concerning for Williams (pictured arriving for his appearance on Letterman's show in 2013) who is already facing an investigation by NBC News . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Williams claimed on the Nightly News in 2011 that he had flown with SEAL Team 6 at the start of the war in 2003 .

"It's hardly worthy of a Terminator film, but the owner of the remote controlled vehicles in this video footage must have a lot of time on his hands. The oddly compelling footage, shot in Magog, Canada last month, shows a the exploits of a remote controlled car as it ventures out onto a frozen lake. Using cameras installed in the vehicle, viewers can watch as the car becomes stuck in a patch of thin ice shortly after it embarks on its exploratory mission. Luckily for the owner - who uses the online pseudonym 'Traxxalu' - help was at hand in for the form of a nifty remote controlled rescue truck, complete with a robotic arm and snow chains.

"It was panda playtime in this reserve as a bunch of rowdy juveniles rolled around a bamboo platform grappling one another. The two-minute long footage was shot at China’s Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in the  Sichuan province. In the clip, the pandas paw at each other and somersault out of their enclosure as the playful fight turns in to a mass brawl. As the brawl breaks out between the pandas, one tries to keep his distance and slowly backtracks . In the opening sequence, two of the pandas pair up - to the left, one tries to scurry up a tree . But as the panda clambers up the tree he is grabbed by a standing juvenile and dragged back to the ground . Four of the pandas then scuffle on the edge of their enclosure watched by a crowd of excited onlookers . Two of the pandas slip off the bamboo platform as the mass brawl breaks out in the China reserve . In the opening clip, one of the pandas quickly exits the fray by scurrying up a tree but is dragged back down and given a slap for his troubles. Another who elects to stay out of the action is pounced upon by the more active juveniles and slips off the platform. The remaining three are then caught up in a tussle with only one left standing as the victor. The panda brawl was greeted by a mix of shocked gasps and roars of laughter from the watching crowd. Ho Lu, 40, a panda keeper at the reserve said: 'The pandas are pretty friendly creatures really but play fighting is an important part of growing up, it prepares them for finding their place in panda society when they are older and works out a sort of hierarchy.' Three pandas were left to battle it out on one of the bamboo platforms inside the reserve . One of the pandas breaks off leaving the last two standing to trade blows and emerge victorious . China's Wolong Nature Reserve is attempting to bring the panda population back from the verge of extinction. At the centre, they train pandas for release into the wild. Keepers who interact with pandas must wear panda costumes (which also smell like pandas) in order to mimic costumes in the wild. Giant pandas are an endangered species, with about 1,600 left in the wild. They usually prefer their own company when foraging in Chinese bamboo forests.","Video clip was shot at China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding .

"Mexican gang members stabbed a teenager to death before taunting his family on Facebook by giving gruesome clues about where he was buried. Victim Irvin Reyes, aged 14, was kidnapped as he left school in Ciudad Juarez, a city in northern Mexico and taken to a derelict house. Police believe he was attacked and badly beaten before being stabbed and dumped in the abandoned house, with his body buried under the floorboards. Fourteen-year-old Irvin Reyes who was beaten and stabbed to death by a gang in Mexico before they taunted his family over Facebook with gruesome clues over where he was buried . Irvin's parents were then left wondering where their son was after being taken by the gang on his way home from school. Then members of the gang spent the week after the killing taunting the youngster's family through anonymous Facebook accounts, telling them their son was dead and leaving gruesome clues as to where he could be. Eventually they revealed the address of where Irvin's body had been dumped and police found his remains. Police spokesman Comissario Tirso Diaz said: 'They had been taunting and bullying him on the internet and social media for several months. We do not yet know why he was targeted. 'It was a particularly cruel way to tell his mother and father what they had done but they made a game of it with various clues. The gang took Irvin to this street in the northern Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez and dumped his body in an abandoned house . 'The mother was with the police detectives when the body was found and identified him from the clothing including new trainers that he had purchased only a day before he vanished.' Police are now attempting to track down the gang members using the messages they sent to Irvin and his family. Mr Diaz added: 'They think they have been clever but they left a very wide trail to follow through social media. 'There is no doubt that we will find them.'","Irvin Reyes was kidnapped as he left school in a city in northern Mexico .

"High-resolution images taken by the Rosetta probe during a Valentine's Day flyby reveal comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in unprecedented detail. The images reveal boulders on the comet's surface, as well as 'stunning details of the contrasting terrain,' the European Space Agency said. The boulders in these images range in size from a few metres to a few tens of metres, and lay scattered across the comet's surface. Scroll down for video . A four-image montage of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko comprising images taken on 14 February 2015 during the first dedicated close flyby. This image set was taken at 10:32 GMT from a distance of 7.8 miles (12.6 km) from the comet centre. Using the surface distance, the image scale is 0.9 m/pixel . To take the images, Rosetta passed within just four miles (6 km) of the surface of the comet in the first dedicated close flyby of the mission. The sun was directly behind Rosetta as the pictures were taken, providing optimal light conditions. The closest approach took place at 12:41 GMT over the Imhotep region on the comet's large lobe. Rosetta's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet's small lobe at the top of the image, with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set. A closeup of the comet shows the surface's crags or ice and rock and the smooth layers of dust.  The sun was directly behind Rosetta as the pictures were taken, providing optimal light conditions. To take the images, Rosetta passed within just four miles (6 km) of the surface of the comet in the first dedicated close flyby . Esa's Rosetta spacecraft launched on 2 March 2004 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, on a mission to visit comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It took more than ten years to reach the comet, and on the way it flew past Mars and two asteroids. On 6 August 2014 it entered orbit around the comet, beginning a series of complex manoeuvres to get the best views possible. On 12 November 2014 Rosetta successfully released a smaller vehicle it had carried called Philae. This small probe bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest. Although Philae's landing did not go as planned, it was still able to complete more than 90 per cent of the science it was intended to do before its main batteries died, sending the probe to sleep. The location of the lander is currently unknown. It is thought to be in partial shadow near a cliff but, as the comet approaches the sun, the additional light may charge its solar panels enough for the lander to wake up. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing its mission around the comet. 67P is approaching the sun and, by August this year, it is thought its activity will have dramatically increased. This will release much more ice, vapour and other materials from the surface - and Rosetta will be there to watch it all happen. As well as providing the opportunity to take close-up high-resolution images of the comet surface, flybys like this also allow Rosetta's instruments to sample the innermost parts of the comet's atmosphere, or coma. Rosetta is now moving out for a far view of the comet – it will reach a distance of about 160 miles (255km) from the comet centre tomorrow. Earlier this week, Nasa said the structure of Comet 67P resembles ice cream. In an experiment, they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard, outer crust, the interior would mostly be fluffy ice. Rosetta's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet's small lobe at the top of the image, with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set . 'A comet is like deep fried ice cream,' said Dr Murthy Gudipati of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, corresponding author of a recent study appearing in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. 'The crust is made of crystalline ice, while the interior is colder and more porous. The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.' To come to the conclusion, astronomers used an icebox-like instrument nicknamed Himalaya. They showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up. The composition of comets is important to understanding how they might have delivered water and organics to the young, hot Earth. New results from the Rosetta mission show that asteroids may have been the primary carriers of life's ingredients; however, the debate is ongoing and comets may have played a role.

"When James Richards decided to ask his partner of 13 years to marry him, he wanted it to be an extra special occasion. So the romantic 35-year-old, from Swansea, South Wales, decided to aim high - and attempted to enlist the help of his favourite pop star. James wrote to Paloma Faith, contacting her through her Facebook page, to ask if she would lend a hand popping the question to his other half Chris Howells. Chris (right) was on a train home when he received the message, he says he was overwhelmed but immediately said yes to partner James (left) But he never expected a response and was shocked when the Stone Cold Sober singer recorded a personal message for Chris, 42.

"Infectious diseases, such as Ebola and West Nile virus, will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming. This is according to zoologist, Professor Daniel Brooks, who warns humans can expect to face new illnesses as climate change brings crops, livestock, and humans into contact with pathogens. Professor Brooks says it will be 'the death of a thousand cuts' with society unable to keep up with the speed of disease as it spreads around the world. Scroll down for video . Infectious diseases, such as Ebola (pictured) and West Nile virus, will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming.This is according to zoologist, Professor Daniel Brooks, who warns humans can expect to face new illnesses as climate change brings crops, livestock, and humans into contact with pathogens . 'It's not that there's going to be one ""Andromeda Strain"" that will wipe everybody out on the planet,' Professor Brooks said, referring to the 1971 science fiction film about a deadly pathogen. 'There are going to be a lot of localised outbreaks that put a lot of pressure on our medical and veterinary health systems.' In his research, Professor Brooks has focused primarily on parasites in the tropics, while his colleague, Professor Eric Hoberg, has worked in Arctic regions. Each has observed the arrival of species that hadn't previously lived in that area and the departure of others, said Professor Brooks, who is affiliated with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Changes in habitat from global warming could mean animals are exposed to new parasites and pathogens. In 1990, the UN's climate panel predicted with ‘substantial confidence’ that the world would warm at twice the rate that has been observed since. Pictured are two projected outcomes of global warming from 2081-2100 . 'Over the last 30 years, the places we've been working have been heavily impacted by climate change,' he added. 'Though I was in the tropics and he was in the Arctic, we could see something was happening.' Changes in habitat from global warming could mean animals are exposed to new parasites and pathogens. For example, some lungworms in recent years have moved northward and shifted hosts from caribou to muskoxen in the Canadian Arctic. But for more than 100 years, scientists have assumed parasites don't quickly jump from one species to another because of the way parasites and hosts co-evolve. Professor Brooks calls it the 'parasite paradox.' Over time, hosts and pathogens become more tightly adapted to one another. According to previous theories, this should make emerging diseases rare, because they have to wait for the right random mutation to occur. But it turns out such jumps happen more quickly than anticipated. Even pathogens that are highly adapted to one host are able to shift to new ones under the right circumstances. Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. It thrives in warm and humid conditions - which could one day include include large areas in Europe . European holiday destinations could become hotspots for the nasty viral illness thanks to climate change, experts have warned. The Po Valley in Italy, the Spanish Mediterranean and southern Spain are the areas at most risk, according to research last year by the University of East Anglia (UEA). Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. Symptoms include a severe flu-like illness, fever, headache, muscle ache, rash, nausea and vomiting. The new study was based on data collected in Mexico, where dengue is a common problem. Researchers looked at the occurrence of the viral illness and climate variables such as temperature, humidity and rainfall, along with other factors. They then combined their findings with information about EU countries, to model which areas are most likely to be at risk, according to the study, published in the journal BMC Public Health. 'Our study has shown that the risk of dengue fever is likely to increase in Europe under climate change,' said lead researcher Professor Paul Hunter. 'Almost all of the excess risk will fall on the coastal areas of the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas and the North Eastern part of Italy, particularly the Po Valley.' Professor Brooks is calling for a 'fundamental conceptual shift' recognising that parasites and pathogens retain genetic capabilities that allow them to quickly shift to new hosts. 'Though a parasite might have a very specialised relationship with one particular host in one particular place, there are other hosts that may be as susceptible,' Professor Brooks said. In fact, the new hosts are more susceptible to infection and get sicker from it, he said, because they haven't yet developed resistance. Though resistance can evolve fairly rapidly, this only changes the emergent pathogen from an acute disease problem to a chronic problem, Brooks said. 'West Nile Virus is a good example of this phenomenon - no longer an acute disease problem for humans or wildlife in North America, it nonetheless is here to stay,' he said. In addition to treating human cases of an emerging disease and developing a vaccine for it, he said, scientists can learn which non-human species carry the virus. 'We have to admit we're not winning the war against emerging diseases,' Professor Brooks said. 'We're not anticipating them. We're not paying attention to their basic biology, where they might come from and the potential for new pathogens to be introduced.'","This is according to Nebraska-based zoologist Professor Daniel Brooks .

"Google's Boston Dynamics released a video last week designed to show off a smaller, lighter version of its robotic dog called Spot. But the video received an unexpected backlash after people began complaining that the 'dog' in the clip had been mistreated. During the footage, employees are seen kicking Spot to prove how stable the machine is on its feet, but this has been dubbed 'cruel', 'wrong' and has even raised concerns about robotic ethics. Scroll down for video . Google's Boston Dynamics released a video last week designed to show off a smaller, lighter version of its robotic dog, dubbed Spot. During the footage, employees are seen kicking Spot to prove how stable the machine is on its feet, but this has been dubbed 'cruel', 'wrong' and has raised concerns about ethics . The four-legged, 160lb (73kg) robo-pet can run, climb stairs, jog next to its owner and correct its balance on uneven terrain, and when kicked. It was built by Google-owned Boston Dynamics and is the 'little brother' of the firm's larger Cujo, or 'big dog'. Boston Dynamics has not revealed what Spot will be used for, but its video showed the robot-animal climbing up and down hills, walking through offices and, of course, being kicked repeatedly. Following the video's release, viewers posted their concerns on Twitter. One user wrote: 'Kicking a dog, even a robot dog seems wrong.' Another said: 'Just wrong, kick a robot dog as practice: Google's dog robot looks too real for comfort when getting kicked.' A third added: 'When I first saw [the] Boston Dynamics video I was very disturbed regarding dog-kicking. I'm not the only one.' Following the video's release, viewers posted concerns on Twitter. One user wrote: 'Kicking a dog, even a robot dog seems wrong.'Andother said: 'Spot the dog has kickstarted a legit ethical debate over robot rights' While a fourth added: 'Spot the dog has kickstarted a legit ethical debate over robot rights.' Equally, comments on  MailOnline's original story about Spot included: 'If I ever run across this guy I'm going to kick HIM...poor doggy,' and 'Where's PETA. Look. He kicked that dog!' To prove this point, CNN filmed reactions to the video in which many viewers said they were shocked and surprised. But not everyone was as concerned. One Twitter user wrote: 'Kicking a dog is wrong; it feels, breathes, and remembers. A robot is a piece of sheet metal.' The four-legged, 160lb (73kg) robo-pet (picutred walking through Boston Dynamic's offices) can run, climb stairs, jog next to its owner and correct its balance on uneven terrain, and when kicked . Others said: 'Are they alive? You people need clarity,' and 'Is it cruel to kick a hammer? A rock? A cardboard box?' When questioned about the video, animal rights group PETA said: 'PETA deals with actual animal abuse every day, so we won't lose sleep over this incident. In a recent paper by Dr Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, he posed the question: 'In the future it's possible we will be able to create artificially human brains that emulate a real human - but what are the ethicalities and moralities of doing this?.' In particular, in his 'Ethics of brain emulations' research, Dr Sandberg considers a future in which AI may be commonplace in so-called 'lesser beings'. If brain emulation becomes possible we could in theory clone animals to create, for example, virtual laboratory rats. There is much opposition to performing scientific experiments on rats and other animals in the modern day - but Dr Sandberg questions whether people will have similar objections to experimenting on an animal that was artificially created. Dr Sandberg likened the scenario to abortion in the modern day and the battle between people who are pro-choice and those who are pro-life. If an emulation was run for just a millisecond of time before being deactivated, some might argue that this would constitute a 'murder' of sorts, destroying a life as it had been created. 'But while it's far better to kick a four-legged robot than a real dog, most reasonable people find even the idea of such violence inappropriate, as the comments show.' Noel Sharkey from the University of Sheffield, UK, added: 'The only way it's unethical is if the robot could feel pain.' This is not the first time Boston Dynamics has used to tactic to demonstrate its machines' balancing skills. In 2008, it released a similar video for its Big Dog in which the larger model was also kicked by employees. It was also filmed walking through snow and shows how the robot can correct its stance when walking on ice. Spot and Big Dog are an electrically powered and hydraulically actuated robots that walk, trot and  climb steps. A sensor on the robots' head helps it navigate over rough terrain - and to spot when humans, or another robo-dog is nearby by, allowing it to follow its owner and run in formation. During the video, the robot is also shown 'going for a walk' with its 'big brother'. Last year, a mathematician said robots will never have feelings because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling. Professor Phil Maguire of the National University of Ireland in Maynooth said that consciousness cannot be created in a physical machine in finite time using limited memory. Using a mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Professor Maguire concluded that the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness. He believes that integrated information can't be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds, because the brain contextualises information. For example, when we see a red triangle our brains don't register the shape as a colourless triangle plus a shapeless coloured area. Instead we see it as a whole - a red triangle, we understand the 'wider picture'. This is not the first time Boston Dynamics has used to tactic to demonstrate its machines' balancing skills. In 2008, it released a similar video for its Big Dog in which the larger model was also kicked by employees, filmed walking through snow and shows how the robot can correct its stance when walking on ice . Spot (left) was built by Google-owned Boston Dynamics and is the 'little brother' of the firm's larger Cujo, or 'big dog' (pictured right) Boston Dynamics has not revealed what Spot will be used for, its video showed the robot-animal climbing up and down hills, walking through offices and, of course, being kicked repeatedly . Therefore, if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information, computers can’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans. Professor Phil Maguire of the National University of Ireland in Maynooth added that consciousness cannot be created in a physical machine in finite time using limited memory. ‘It doesn't necessarily mean there is some magic going on in the brain that involves some forces that can't be explained physically. It is just so complex that it's beyond our abilities to reverse it and decompose it,’ he said. His research may mean that while humans may not find love with a robot, they are unlikely to be made their slaves either. But not everyone was as concerned. Twitter users tweeted: 'Are they alive? You people need clarity,' and 'Is it cruel to kick a hammer? A rock?' Spot is pictured roaming with another robot (left) and climbing steps (right). Animals rights group PETA said it deals with actual animal abuse so 'won't lose sleep over this incident' This theory was put to the test recently in a paper by Dr Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University. In his 'Ethics of brain emulations' research, he posed the question: 'In the future it's possible we will be able to create artificially human brains that emulate a real human - but what are the ethicalities and moralities of doing this?.' In his paper Dr Sandberg considered a future in which AI may be commonplace in so-called 'lesser beings'. Cujo is made by Boston Dynamics, which was bought by Google, and costs $2 million to create. It can walk and run over rugged terrain, following a soldier while carrying their kit and weapons. It can stand upright, walk for 20 miles without a break and carry up to 400lbs. The controls are simple to learn and have joysticks, and one recruit said using it 'feels like playing Call of Duty.' If brain emulation becomes possible we could in theory clone animals to create, for example, virtual laboratory rats. There is much opposition to performing scientific experiments on rats and other animals in the modern day - but Dr Sandberg questions whether people will have similar objections to experimenting on an animal that was artificially created. 'In particular, emulations of animals could be used instead of real animals for experiments in education, science, medicine or engineering,' Dr Sandberg wrote. 'If it is cruel to pinch the tail of biological mice, the same cruel impulse is present in pinching the simulated tail of an emulated mouse. 'Treating emulations well might be like treating dolls well: it might not be morally obligatory but it is compassionate.' He also suggested that it might be necessary to perform neuroscience experiments on 'real' animals in order to make brain emulation a possibility - which itself could lead to opposition. Dr Sandberg likened the scenario to abortion in the modern day and the battle between people who are pro-choice and those who are pro-life. If an emulation was run for just a millisecond of time before being deactivated, some might argue that this would constitute a 'murder' of sorts, destroying a life as it had been created.","Boston Dynamics released the video of its 'Spot' robotic dog last week .

A funny new video reimagines the Nineties sitcom Friends in a modern setting, with some hilarious results . In the clip,  Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler and Joey are replaced by a group of six modern-day selfie-taking twenty-somethings dressed in hipster-worthy clothe . In the show's iconic theme tune montage, instead of dancing around a fountain together, they all focus on their phones, texting and striking a pose as they absentmindedly take pictures of themselves. Even when they jauntily pop open their colourful umbrellas as with the original credits, their eyes remain glued to their smartphones. And instead of the classic single I'll Be There For You by The Rembrandts, this rebooted version, created by Nerdist, features an edgy remix. The lyrics play off the original refrain but add in updated lyrics addressing the current vogue for online dating, going dairy-free or, like Beyonce, opting for a 'plant-based' diet. The song begins: 'No one told you life was gonna be this way, your Tinder profile sucks and you spilled your almond milk latte.

'Feels like everyone's growing out their beard and your roommate's going vegan while you're drinking gluten-free beer.' The song then mentions the greatest difference between Friends then and now - mobile phones. 'I'll be there for you, if you shoot me a text first. 'I'll be there for you, taking phone calls is the worst. 'I'll be there for you, but my battery's really low.'

The Queen's granddaughter had joined Mike Tindall in Innsbruck, Austria, for the Channel 4 show, and the couple were seen visiting a kebab shop for a late-night snack after the final. The former Rugby International came joint second place on the show with athlete Louise Hazel as they lost out to former TOWIE star Joey Essex. Hold the hot sauce: Zara Phillips orders at a kebab shop in Innsbruck, Austria after celebrating husband Mike Tindall's second place on The Jump . Mike, 36, and Zara, 33, visited the Chili kebab shop in Innsbruck in the early hours after the final and tucked into their greasy meal before heading home holding takeaway boxes. Zara wore a black fur-lined coat and black heeled ankleboots, while her husband looked more casual in jeans and a green puffer-style jacket. The couple, who married in 2011, live on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Estate with their young daughter Mia, born last year. It was reported last week that they are set to revamp a Grade II listed farmhouse where Zara's father, Captain Mark Phillips, had been living since his divorce from Anne in 1992. Once a high-tech renovation has been carried out on Aston Farm, set in 600 acres on the Princess Royal’s estate,the young family will move in. Late night treat: Zara had been supporting her husband as he took part in the Channel 4 winter sports show, which saw him make it to the final where he lost out to Joey Essex .

"Angel Di Maria has revealed that Paris Saint-Germain's well-documented financial issues prevented him moving to France rather than Manchester United last summer. The French giants were issued with a spending restriction last summer for breaching UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations with Di Maria subsequently making the move to Old Trafford for a British transfer record of £59.7 million. And the Argentine believes PSG’s money troubles were the key reason why they halted their pursuit. Angel Di Maria celebrates scoring the opening goal against QPR at Old Trafford in September . ‘PSG, I think they had a money problem and they couldn’t buy players,' Di Maria said in an interview with French broadcaster Telefoot. 'This is the main reason I didn’t go there. Playing in the French league would please a lot of players. 'Now I’m in the English league. But you never know, there is a lot of movements in football. You can never predict where you’re going to play. 'There were a lot of clubs interested in me. A lot really. But Manchester United appeared and didn’t go away. They absolutely wanted me and it happened.” Di Maria, in action for Real Madrid, takes on Patrice Evra (left) and Michael Carrick in February 2013 . Di Maria has made an impressive start to his career in the Premier League but the former Los Blancos star refused to ruled out a move to the Ligue 1 side later in his career. 'It could have been a good experience for me to go to Paris,' he added. 'I know I’m still young, perhaps I’ll go to PSG one day. I don’t know how it will all end.' Di Maria insisted he had no regrets leaving the Bernabeu in the summer despite United’s on-field struggles this season. ‘It’s a different style of football here at Manchester United,' he stated. 'I’m very happy. I don’t have regrets about leaving Real Madrid. I think I won everything I wanted with Real: La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa Del Rey.'

"Daley Blind could face several weeks on the sidelines after suffering a medial ligament injury in Holland’s 6-0 win over Latvia. In the latest blow to Manchester United, Blind went down in the 19th minute at the Amsterdam ArenA after Eduards Visnakovs landed on his knee. Blind's is the 39th United injury since Louis van Gaal took charge in July - that's an average of one injury every three days. Blind was able to limp off unaided but Holland manager Guus Hiddink said his ligament could be twisted and possibly ruptured.

Dec 14: Liverpool H . Dec 20: Aston Villa A . Dec 26: Newcastle United H . Dec 28: Tottenham Hotspur A . Dutch TV scaled down this diagnosis to a ‘small tear’, saying Blind will likely miss four-six weeks. A full MRI scan on Monday will reveal the full extent of the damage but it looks as though Blind will be out until the New Year. Blind took to Instagram to confirm the news of his injury saying: 'I'm proud of my 25 games for the Dutch national team, but I'm so gutted with my injury... I'll stay positive and will come back stronger! Nevertheless a great win, 6-0!' Hiddink said: ‘I’m am not a doctor, but I’m rather negative. His medial ligament is twisted and there might be a rupture as well. There will be a full MRI scan tomorrow.’ It is just the latest injury blow for United boss Louis van Gaal, who is already without a number of key personnel. Goalkeeper David De Gea faces four weeks out after dislocating a finger during training with Spain on Friday. Defenders Phil Jones (shin splints), Marcos Rojo (dislocated shoulder), Rafael (muscle problems) and Jonny Evans (ankle) are all on the treatment table.

Radamel Falcao: Calf/shin Injury . Jonny Evans: Ankle/foot Injury . Jesse Lingard: Knee injury . Midfielder Michael Carrick withdrew from the England squad last week with a groin problem, while Ander Herrera has been struggling with a fractured rib. Striker Radamel Falcao has been struggling to overcome a calf problem but could be in contention for Saturday’s trip to Arsenal in the Premier League. Blind, who joined from Ajax for £13.8m in the summer, has featured in eight matches so far for United and has been one of their most consistent performers. With Van Gaal’s defence so threadbare, Blind was forced to play at centre half during United’s last match - the 1-0 win over Crystal Palace at Old Trafford last week. It means Herrera could be rushed back into action at the Emirates, while Tyler Blackett and Patrick McNair could be called upon at centre half. The young players have just 10 Premier League appearances between them. United are currently seventh in the table, some 13 points adrift of leaders Chelsea, and Blind’s injury will come as another hammer blow. His withdrawal didn’t affect Holland, who romped to a six-goal win thanks to doubles from Arjen Robben and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and further strikes from Robin van Persie and Jeffrey Bruma .

September 12: Versatile defender Phil Jones is ruled out for up to a month with a hamstring injury. September 21: Defender Jonny Evans suffers a foot injury in a calamitous 5-3 defeat at Leicester, with Smalling replacing him as he made his own return from the groin problem sustained in August. Another defender, Tyler Blackett, is sent off and suspended. September 24: Smalling suffers a new injury - this time to his thigh - in training. September 25: Van Gaal confirms he is now down to just one fit centre back - Rojo - for the game against West Ham. September 27: Nineteen-year-old Paddy McNair is drafted in for a senior debut against the Hammers. He also features against Everton and Manchester City.

"Egpytian warplanes blitzed Islamic State targets in Libya yesterday after fanatics released a horrific video showing the beheading of 21 Christians on a beach. They bombed IS training camps, weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of airstrikes following the gruesome murder of captured Egyptian workers. Meanwhile, the Egyptian government called for Britain and the rest of the US-led coalition to also target IS on Libyan territory. Scroll down for video . Bombing: It was Egypt’s first official military action in Libya since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 . Damage caused: Destroyed buildings seen after Egypt's army warplanes carried out airstrikes in neighbouring Libya against targets belonging to Islamic State yesterday . The bombing, Egypt’s first official military action in Libya since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi four years ago, came after a day of international outrage at the slickly-produced IS beheading video. Lasting five minutes, it shows a group of Coptic Christians dressed in Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits being marched one-by-one along a lonely beach, each held by a fighter clad in black. It appears to be dusk and the sea laps at the sand and rocks. The men their, faces uncovered, are then made to kneel. A jihadist dressed in camouflage fatigues and speaking English with an American accent declares: ‘All crusaders ... The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden’s body in, we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood.’ Destruction: Cairo called on the US-led coalition carrying out strikes over Syria and Iraq to broaden the scope of their operations to include Libya. Pictured above is damage caused by the Egyptian attack . Ripped open: Destroyed buildings seen after Egyptian warplanes carried out airstrikes in neighbouring Libya . Returning: An Egyptian Army photograph of an F-16 fighter landing after carrying an airstrike against militants loyal to Islamic State in Derna in eastern Libya, at a military base in an undisclosed location . The men are then forced to lie face-down before they are beheaded simultaneously. The US is sending 4,000 troops to Kuwait – raising the prospect of a ground assault against Islamic State fighters. The combat brigade, supported by armoured vehicles, is largely composed of battle-hardened veterans of the Iraq War. They will bolster the existing US force in Kuwait and could be used to counter the spread of IS extremists in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. Although Barack Obama has ruled out another large-scale operation, he is seeking approval from Congress for the ‘flexibility’ to send in ground forces in ‘limited circumstances’. The Kuwait force – the 3rd Brigade Combat Team – has been training for more than a year for a possible confrontation with IS. However, Iraqi PM Haidar al-Abadi, who has vowed to retake the city of Mosul from IS, said he needed equipment rather than foreign ‘boots on the ground’. The camera zooms in on the sea as the water turns red with blood. Britain condemned the murders as ‘barbaric’. The US said the video showed the ‘wanton killing of innocents’. Last night, the video was being seen as IS’s bid to announce its presence in a new region where it is gaining influence. The former head of MI6, Sir John Sawers, said Britain should consider putting troops on the ground in the country. He told the Daily Telegraph that Libya had descended into chaos since Britain joined the US and its allies in bringing down Gaddafi’s regime. The Prime Minister’s spokesman defended Britain’s role in the overthrow of Gaddafi, saying: ‘This was a country where people were being oppressed by a dictator, where they were not able to pursue their aspirations and have their voice heard.’ Egyptian state TV showed warplanes over Libya as the military declared they were ‘avenging Egyptian blood and retaliating against criminals and killers’. Libyan officials said 40 fighters and two civilians had been killed. Blast: A video still from aerial footage released  by the Egyptian Ministry of Defence shows an airstrike on Islamic State group positions in Libya yesterday . Airstrike: Egpytian warplanes bombed IS training camps, weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of airstrikes following the gruesome murder of captured Egyptian workers . Mourning: Neighbours and friends of the relatives of Egyptian Coptic men killed in Libya sit at the courtyard of a church before a mass at El-Our village in Minya, south of Cairo yesterday . Cairo called on the US-led coalition carrying out strikes over Syria and Iraq to broaden the scope of their operations to include Libya. The country’s internationally recognized government has been confined to its far east since militias seized the capital Tripoli last year. ‘Leaving things in Libya as they are without decisive intervention to suppress these terror groups constitutes a clear danger to international peace and security,’ the Egyptian foreign ministry warned. French president François Hollande called for the UN security council to meet over Libya and to take new measures against the growing power of the militants. Italy has already said it is willing to lead a coalition of European and North African countries to stop the IS advance. Shocking: The bombing came after a day of international outrage at the slickly-produced IS beheading video . Horrifying: Lasting five minutes, the video shows a group of Coptic Christians dressed in Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits being marched one-by-one along a lonely beach, each held by a fighter clad in black . Significantly, it has not ruled out using ground forces. The video of the beheadings, posted online by Libyan jihadists loyal to IS, is the first to come from outside the group’s heartland of Syria and Iraq, raising fears it has established a new foothold just 450 miles from the Italian coast. Pope Francis expressed ‘profound sadness’ at the murders. ‘They were executed for nothing more than the fact that they were Christians,’ he said. ‘Their only words were: ‘Jesus, help me!’ The Egyptian workers were seized in separate kidnappings in December and January from the coastal town of Sirte in eastern Libya, under the control of Islamist groups. Libya is home to a large community of both Muslim and Coptic Egyptians, with most working in the construction sector.","Egpytian warplanes bomb IS training camps and weapons stockpiles .

"A German rapper-turned ISIS extremist who starred in the group's grisly beheading videos was being spied on for the FBI by a woman he thought was his wife. Denis Cuspert, 39, who now calls himself Abu Talha al-Amani, embraced radical Islam and travelled to Syria to fight with militants before becoming the group's main propagandist. The spy transmitted critical information about the rapper and his ISIS colleagues before escaping to Turkey - where she was arrested and then turned over to the US, according to the German newspaper Bild. Passed on inintelligence: German rapper-turned ISIS extremist Denis Cuspert was being spied on for the FBI by a woman he thought was his wife, it has been revealed . The paper said German and American intelligence sources confirmed the existence of the operation, Fox News reports. The unidentified woman fled Syria after her handlers told her it was no longer safe to continue the mission as militants had began to hunt for and flush out infiltrators. She is now believed to be in the US. German newspaper Bild believe Cuspert may have been targeted for the operation because of his womanising past. In Germany he fathered three children by three different women, including one who he dumped just before embarking on his career as an ISIS poster boy. Cuspert arrived in Syria in 2013 from a so-called German jihadi colony in Egypt. It was not clear when he married the spy, but Bild reported that she informed her US handler via secret methods on regular basis about ISIS activities. Poster boy: Cuspert, 39, who now calls himself Abu Talha al-Amani, embraced radical Islam and travelled to Syria to fight with militants before becoming the group's main propagandist . It is not known how she communicated the information to her handler. Last week the US added rapper Cuspert to its list of 'global terrorists' - freezing all his assets under US control and prohibiting any transactions with him in the future. The State Department said: 'Cuspert is emblematic of the type of foreign recruit ISIL seeks for its ranks -– individuals who have engaged in criminal activity in their home countries who then travel to Iraq and Syria to commit far worse crimes against the people of those countries.' In November, Cuspert was compared to Nazi Minister for Propaganda Joseph Goebbels for his ability to appeal to young, disillusioned people in Europe while providing an alternative ideology. He spent several years as a major player in the Berlin hip hop scene under the name 'Deso Dogg' before embracing radical Islam. He has been known to oversee the group's sophisticated media operation and is reportedly using British fighters in an attempt to attract even more of their countrymen to the war-torn region. It is understood he leads a unit of German-speaking ISIS terrorists operating under the name 'The German Brigade of Millatu Ibrahim'. Terrorist: It is understood Cuspert (left) leads a unit of German-speaking ISIS militants operating under the name 'The German Brigade of Millatu Ibrahim' Last year, the rapper appeared in an ISIS beheading video and was seen holding the severed head of a man who he claims fought the terror group and as a result 'received the death penalty'. Another man in the video explains in Arabic that the victims were members of Syria's al-Sheitaat tribe, a group of about 70,000 Sunnis who are fighting ISIS. Around 700 members of the tribe were massacred by ISIS in August. The Sun reports he is the subject of a dossier compiled by German security services, which quotes him as saying: 'My duty is to use my voice for telling people the truth and the truth is jihad is a duty. The lyrics in his song 'Who's Afraid of the Black Man"" show his hatred for the West and his tendency towards violence. The song states: 'Doing time in my skin like Tookie Williams in San Quentin. No identity, where will this end? 'In a white world full of hate and illusion. The last option was only violence and emotion.' Terrorism expert Raphael Perl of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) told Dutch newspaper Trouw: 'He gained fame with music and now he brings his fans in contact with a radical ideology.' The most recent German intelligence data estimates 500 German Muslims have traveled to the Iraqi and Syria. Roughly 150 radical Islamic fighters are back in Germany, posing an enormous challenge for the country’s taxed counter-terrorism officials.","Denis Cuspert known as 'Deso Dogg' before travelling to Syria as extremist .

"A kindergarten teacher has been suspended without pay after school officials said she videotaped a child beating other children and did not intervene. Teacher Rita Baci, 65, also used her foot to push a kindergarten student out of her class and left him unattended, according to the Duval County schools investigative report in northeast Florida. The incidents allegedly took place in November. Teacher Rita Baci, 65, has been suspended without pay from Duval County Public Schools' John E. Ford Montessori (pictured) in Florida after allegedly videotaping a child beating other children . The Florida Times-Union reported that a school district investigation found that Baci on three occasions used her cellphone video camera to record a boy beating on other students. The videos revealed one boy being hit 'about his face and body several times', another student being kicked while he tried to take cover under a table and a third being punched, according to Fox. The investigator found that Baci had shown the tapes to other students and a vice principal before a meeting with the child's parents. Officials say Baci violated the district's code of ethics and professional conduct when she failed to make a reasonable effort to protect students from harm.

"No receipt: John Durning has never been asked for a receipt from Ed Balls despite cleaning the windows at his Castleford home once a month . Ed Balls was accused of ‘total hypocrisy’ last night after his window cleaner revealed he has never asked for a receipt in 17 years. The Shadow Chancellor provoked controversy at the weekend when he lectured families on their duty to collect receipts and personal details from gardeners, cleaners and handymen, no matter how small the job done. Mr Balls said he always followed the practice – and had done ‘since I have been involved in politics’. But inquiries in Castleford, West Yorkshire, where he and his MP wife Yvette Cooper have a family home, have shown that he has never asked his window cleaning firm for a receipt despite employing them for nearly two decades. Pontefract Window Cleaning Services last night confirmed it had never been asked for a receipt by Mr Balls. The firm cleans the windows at the three-storey Balls family home once a month, charging £12 each time. Christine Durning, 66, who handles the family firm’s paperwork, refused to criticise Mr Balls for his comments and said she ‘didn’t want to get involved in any controversy’. But she added: ‘I’m not doing anything wrong here, I’m just telling you the facts and I don’t give him a receipt and he doesn’t ask for a receipt.’ Mrs Durning said the well-established family firm had never been asked for a receipt by any of its customers. Instead they simply take cash or cheque or write their customers a note to inform them money is due. Her son John, 34, who cleans the MPs’ windows, said: ‘It only takes me about ten minutes to do, it’s no problem. After each clean I drop a note through the door which states, “Your windows have been cleaned”. ‘I see a cleaner sometimes, but I have never seen either of them or even met them.’ Conservative MP Peter Bone last night said it was ‘absurd’ to expect people to get receipts for everything and it was hypocritical of Mr Balls to suggest it. 'Total hypocrisy': The Shadow Chancellor has been slammed by Conservative MP Peter Bone, who said it was ‘absurd’ to expect people to get receipts for everything and it was hypocritical of Mr Balls to suggest it . He said: ‘Having lectured the nation on the need to demand receipts, it turns out he doesn’t even do it himself. ‘It is total hypocrisy from a man who wants to be considered as a potential Chancellor.’ He added: ‘This idea from Ed Balls was ludicrous from the start – you can’t expect people to demand a receipt for every minor job they have done. It is basically suggesting that every small trader is dodging tax, which is a slur.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Mr Balls’s comments suggested Labour was planning a ‘Big Brother’ state where people’s every action was monitored. Even Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna admitted: ‘I have to confess I don’t keep a receipt for every single thing that I get people to do.’ A spokesman for Mr Balls last night said his practice of demanding receipts applied only to jobs where he pays in cash. He pointed out that Mr Balls pays his window cleaner by cheque and receives handwritten invoices every few months. The spokesman said: ‘As Ed said, he asks for receipts when paying in cash for work done so that, as Shadow Chancellor, he knows he has a written record. ‘Needless to say, a cheque obviously means both sides have a written record of the transaction. ‘Ed’s window cleaner sends a bill every few months and he pays them by cheque. He’s done this for 17 years with the same local business.’ The controversy began on Sunday when the question of what constitutes tax avoidance was discussed during a BBC interview. Mr Balls said: ‘The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them.’ On Sunday Ed Balls said he always asked for a receipt because it was the ‘right thing to do’. But he and his wife Yvette Cooper were among MPs criticised when the Parliamentary expenses scandal erupted in 2009. Between 2005 and 2007 they ‘flipped’ their second home designation to three different properties – including their North London home and a constituency property in Castleford, West Yorkshire. The North London home . ...and the constituency home . Under the old expenses system, MPs could designate either a London home or a constituency property as their second home. They could then change the designation of their second home – nicknamed ‘flipping’ – and increase the amount they could claim for mortgage interest payments. Together they claimed a total of £24,400 on their second-home allowance. A Tory MP said it was wrong for them to claim the London property as their second home when they spent most of their time there, but they were cleared by the Standards Commissioner in 2008.","Ed Balls provoked anger after lecturing families about collecting receipts .

"Warning: Home Secretary Theresa May (above) will make an announcement on stop and search today . Theresa May will today promise to change the law if police do not halt the ‘excessive and inappropriate’ use of stop and search. The Home Secretary will warn officers that she wants to see a dramatic improvement in figures showing that only one in every ten of the searches ends in arrest. If police continue to misuse the powers – which are disproportionately targeted against ethnic minorities – legislation will be introduced to tie their hands. Mrs May will make the announcement when delivering this year’s Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust Criminal Justice Lecture, in memory of the murdered black teenager. Stop and search has been blamed for inflaming tensions between the police – labelled ‘institutionally racist’ for their botched response to Stephen’s killing – and black people, in particular. In 2013, a Scotland Yard officer was disciplined for discriminating against Stephen’s younger brother, Stuart, who was followed and stopped while driving in his car. Mr Lawrence – who said he had been targeted simply because of the colour of his skin - complained that he had been stopped or searched by officers on 25 occasions since the age of 17. A recent report by the police watchdog found more than a quarter of police stop and searches are ‘unlawful’ and risk promoting ‘major disorder’. 'Targeted': In 2013, a Scotland Yard officer was disciplined for discriminating against Stephen’s younger brother, Stuart (pictured with his mother Doreen), who was followed and stopped while driving in his car . Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary said that, in 27 per cent of cases, police failed to show they had reasonable grounds to carry out the search. It was the equivalent of 250,000 people every year being stopped and subjected to hugely intrusive searches without the police sticking to the rules. Mrs May is expected to say that, during her time in office, she has heard ‘accounts exposing the excessive and inappropriate use of stop and search.’ She will add of 'evidence that if you are black or from a minority ethnic background that you are up to seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than if you are white’. Stop and search: If police continue to misuse the powers - which are disproportionately targeted against ethnic minorities - legislation will be introduced to tie their hands (file picture) Mrs May had originally wanted to legislate to curb the use of the powers in last year’s Queen’s Speech but was blocked by Number 10. Murdered: Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death at the age of 18 in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993 . Downing Street was said to be keen to support police leaders who argue the search powers are a vital tool against knife crime and gang culture. In a compromise, she instead introduced a voluntary code to which every police force, including the British Transport Police, has agreed. This includes a restriction on the so-called ‘no suspicion’ power, which allows officers to stop and search even when they do not suspect a crime has been committed. A chief police officer must now believe it is ‘necessary’ to authorise use of the power because violence ‘will’ take place. Previously, use of the power could be authorised by a much more junior officer if they believed violence ‘may’ occur. Forces now also have to record the outcome of searches in more detail, including if the suspect was arrested and charged. Mrs May will tell the conference at London’s City Hall, which is supported by the Mail: ‘It is my hope, expectation and objective that these steps will further reduce the number of stops and searches across England and Wales, as the use of these sensitive powers becomes properly targeted, based on reasonable grounds and accountable to citizens and communities. ‘But let me be absolutely clear: if stops and searches do not continue to fall, if the use of these powers does not become more targeted, and stop-to-arrests ratios do not improve, then a Conservative Government will not hesitate to bring in primary legislation to make it happen.’ Stephen was stabbed to death at the age of 18 in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993. The public inquiry into his death accused Scotland Yard of being ‘institutionally racist’. The Mail campaigned to bring the killers to justice and published a landmark front page accusing five men of the murder. Two of the men named – Gary Dobson and David Norris – were eventually convicted of murder in 2012. Last month, the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust and the Daily Mail announced two journalism scholarships.

"Labour ‘infantilised’ welfare claimants by letting them choose a life on benefits, David Cameron declared today. The last government’s handling of the system had divided Britain and created ‘resentment’ among taxpayers, the PM added. In his first election campaign speech on the benefits system, the PM said it was a ‘national disgrace’ under Labour which had ‘infuriated’ those forced to pay for welfare. Labour's handling of the welfare system divided Britain and created ‘resentment’ among taxpayers, the PM said . As he appealed to voters for five more years ‘to finish the job’ Mr Cameron outlined his ‘British deal on welfare’ which he said would ‘restore real fairness to our country’. He confirmed proposals to force jobless youngsters to do community work rather than just going straight on the dole. Instead of signing on, young people will be forced to pick up litter, clean graffiti or work for local charities. This would give them the ‘order and discipline of turning up for work each day’, he said. There are around 50,000 young people a year who currently go straight on to the dole. Mr Cameron defended the coalition’s reforms – including the benefits cap, tax cuts for low earners and rises in the minimum wage - and challenged the idea it was ‘compassionate’ to ‘leave people on the dole for years with no incentive to get into work’. Addressing activists and the media at a school in Hove, East Sussex, he questioned the ‘myth’ that it was ‘kind to sentence people to never going anywhere’ or to let ‘people in their teens and twenties sit at home all day slipping into depression and despair’. Under Labour welfare became ‘a series of giveaways’. Young people could ‘leave school, sign on, start getting your benefit, start getting housing benefit’ while making only a ‘minimal’ contribution, he said. David Cameron appealed  for five more years ‘to finish the job’ to stop Ed Miliband becoming Prime Minister . He said: ‘No CV? No problem. No real effort put in? No problem. ‘And all this had a corrosive effect. For those paying for welfare – it infuriated them. For those dependent on welfare – it infantilised them.’ ‘Because people don’t just live up to expectations – they live down to them too. ‘If you give people nothing to work for, no responsibilities to uphold – they’re going to lose the ability to stretch themselves and find work. Mr Cameron added: ‘Our welfare system should be something that unites our country in pride – not that divides it in resentment.’ The Prime Minister said Labour treated benefit claimants like children . ‘But when people worked hard and paid their taxes, knowing that others were choosing to live on welfare. ‘When they saw their money going on social housing they could never afford to live in. ‘Or when hardworking young people were stuck living with their parents into their 30s – while others got a council house straight out of school, that created a sense of deep unfairness. ‘We are putting that right with a clear set of rules that apply to all; a British deal on welfare.’ Mr Cameron promised people in work would be better off, support for those who are ‘genuinely sick or disabled’ and ‘dignity and security in retirement’ for those who worked hard all their life. But to anyone who refused to work he said: ‘We will not keep supporting you.’ The PM pointed to the rise in employment, and the 700,000 job vacancies for those looking for work. The Government’s economic plan was working and being felt ‘in people’s pockets and homes and hearts and hopes’, he said. The Liberal Democrats attacked the plans saying they placements were designed to ‘punish’ young people. ‘These placements are not designed to help someone into work, more to punish. Just like the Tory plans to axe housing benefit for young people, it's all stick and no carrot,’ a spokesman said. ‘Young people should be given help and support into the work place, help at job centres, and the opportunity to get on in life, not just written off as feckless and lazy.’ Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Rachel Reeves ministers should introduce ‘Labour's compulsory jobs guarantee to get young people off benefits and into paid work.’ 'Under David Cameron young people can spend years claiming benefit without being offered and required to take up paid work. Labour's compulsory jobs guarantee would ensure young people are given the chance to learn, earn and contribute.’","Last government divided Britain and created 'resentment' among workers .

"Ambitious house-hunters are being offered the chance to create a heavenly home in a 19th century church - which is on the market for just £50,000. The Grade II-listed St John's Church in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales is up for sale and boasts its own pulpit, stained-glass windows and a marble memorial to its founder. But investors are also being enticed by the planning permission the building has already been given to be converted into 20 apartments. Scroll down for video . Many of the church's original features remain intact - including a number of stained-glass windows (left) and a bell-tower (right) The church was built in 1827 for the workers at a famous ironworks in the town and it was used for Sunday services right up until 1997 . St John's Church in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales has gone on the market for £50,000 - less than the price of some garages in central London . The church was built by Josiah John Guest, a celebrated ironworker in the region whose company eventually became the top iron producer in the world. The chapel was erected for his workers in 1827 and Mr Guest was buried in an iron coffin at the top of the chancel steps under a red, granite slab. Among the building's features are a miner's window donated by Donny Osmond's grandfather, who was manager at the ironworks. The historic church closed in 1997 after 170 years of holding services. It has remained derelict ever since. The tomb of the founder of the church, Josiah John Guest, remains in the building after he was buried in an iron coffin under a granite slab . The pulpit of the church - from which scores of priests have delivered their sermons over the years - remains in the building . The property has been derelict for nearly 15 years but is now being sold with planning permission to build 20 apartments inside . The building now has planning permission to be converted into flats - as well as listing building consent which ensures some of the historic features remain. Stephen Morgan, auctions manager at Darlows Auction, said: 'The property has fantastic potential, especially for conversion into flats which is something the area would greatly benefit from. 'I think the property would be of particular interest to general investors; for one, it is of great historical significance to the area and needs to be preserved. At the same time, there is great investment potential.' The property's price is less than many garages are now sold for in central and north London. The auction is set for February 25. Auctioneers say the building offers great potential to investors due to its relatively low asking price and historical significance . Many of the building's stained-glass windows remain preserved, although the interior of the building will need considerable work . The planning permission means the property will be able to be converted, although the listed status of the church means conditions will apply .","Church was built by owner of famous ironworks in the town for his workers in 1827 but has been derelict since 1997 .

"A toddler looks to have become the latest victim of Tanzania's sickening trade in albino body parts, after machete-wielding kidnappers stormed his home and attacked his distraught mother. The 18-month-old boy was taken from his home in Chato, on the shores of Lake Victoria, late on Saturday. His mother could do little after the family home was stormed by the kidnappers, who attacked her with machetes as they stole her son. It is feared the little boy will be killed, and his body parts will be used in potions and charms which are believed by some to bring luck and wealth. His father, who was nearby at the time, is now being questioned by police. Horror: The 18-month-old boy was snatched from his home in northern Tanzania on Saturday. Pictured: Children being kept at a centre to prevent them becoming victims of the black market trade in body parts . 'Two bandits armed with machetes stormed into their kitchen, they hit his mother with machetes and took away the baby,' said regional police chief Joseph Konyo. He confirmed the father was being questioned, adding: 'We have asked the public for cooperation to arrest the suspects.' As the MailOnline has previously reported, albino body parts can fetch thousands of dollars on the black market. People are willing to pay as much as $3,000 or $4,000 for a limb, or as much as $75,000 - about £50,000 - for the 'full set', a whole body. Families are known to sell-off their own children in return for the money - a fortune for someone on the average Tanzanian wage. It has left an entire community in fear of their lives: young children with albinism are sent to special schools, where they are kept behind high walls for their own safety. Some of those children have already been attacked, and are missing arms or legs lost to their attackers. Albino rights groups have warned that, as the country's presidential election approaches in October, the demand for body parts is likely to soar. Sickening: Tanzania's albino population is being hunted down by people who want to turn their body parts into potions and charms . Victim: Not all those attacked die: Pendo Sengerema, 15, pictured right with campaigner Vicky Ntetema, was one of three people attacked in 11 days last August . The supposed 'luck' which the charms and potions bring are highly sought after by certain political campaigners, it is thought. And the prices the witch doctors charge mean the people buying them need to have a substantial amount of money behind them. Josephat Torner, an albino rights campaigner who works with charity Standing Voice, told MailOnline last month: 'The big fishes are behind the issue. It has been really a big discussion. If I say big fish, or big people, it is those who have enough resources, enough money. 'People sell the body parts for high prices. So it is not really small fish behind it. 'It could be politicians. It could be those people.' Since people began collecting records of the attacks, there have been 74 killings and 59 survivors of attacks. Even the dead are not safe: 16 graves have been robbed. Hereditary: Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes, affecting one Tanzanian in 1,400 . In August, three people were attacked in just 11 days, while this most recent kidnapping is the second in less than two months. A four-year-old girl, called Pendo Emmanuelle Nundi, was reported missing in December, but has never been found. Her father and uncles were among the 15 questioned - but so far there have been no charges made. In fact, just 10 people have ever come before the courts, and not one of the 'buyers' has ever been named. Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. It affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding, experts say. In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000. Albinos are seen as curses, or 'ghosts' who can be wiped off the face of the earth, in many part of Tanzania, and across Africa. Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes, albinism affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding in remote and rural communities, experts say. In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000. Families are often told to kill the children at birth. Yet, conversely, their body parts are highly prized. But Josephat Torner sees the two as being intrinsically linked. 'The killings and attacks is the outcome of the stigma and discrimination. If you respect me, you won't think of me as a commodity,' he said. Witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches, power and success, if used in potions, while a UN report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets, or would bury them where they are drilling for gold. Fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish. Children are particularly vulnerable: their innocence is highly valued, and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them. Most of the time, limbs are taken - but the report notes there have been cases where victims were beheaded, genitals, ears, and bits of skin were removed; tongues were cut out and the eyes and the heart gouged out. Other types of attacks reported included rape for healing purposes. Possibly most shockingly, some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed, the more potent the charm.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A Russian warship was intercepted by the Royal Navy as it strayed close to the UK while passing through the English Channel. The vessel – equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes – was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. Yesterday, the Ministry of Defence stressed that the encounter was in accordance with international law. However, it comes at a time of heightened tension between Britain and Russia. Cat and mouse: Heavily-armed HMS Argyll follows the Russian warship, background left, as it passes through the English Channel . Last month, RAF jets were scrambled to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew south of Bournemouth. And in November, a four-strong squadron of the country’s Northern Fleet sailed through the Channel. The manoeuvres have raised fears that the Russians are looking for weaknesses in the British naval force. In the latest incident, Plymouth-based HMS Argyll, which has a crew of 185, intercepted the Neustrashimy-class warship and its accompanying tanker as they headed home after a deployment in the Mediterranean. The 4,900-ton Type 23 frigate used its Lynx helicopter and hi-tech sensors to locate the vessels off the French coast and track them as they entered the Channel. The MoD said the Royal Navy took over from French surveillance, in line with the Nato agreement, and described the operation as ‘pretty routine’. But military sources insisted it was vital the Armed Forces were poised to react swiftly as Russia has stepped up its military drills in recent months with a greater number of naval exercises and reports of incursions by Russian fighter jets and bombers. A naval source said: ‘They were not provocative but the British public would expect nothing less of the Navy than to be alert and keep an eye out for any potential threat, and to be ready to react in case it that turns into an actual threat.’ Plymouth-based HMS Argyll (pictured) intercepted the Neustrashimy-class warship and its accompanying tanker as they headed home after a deployment in the Mediterranean . It is understood that the Russian vessels complied with all maritime reporting regulations - they did not encroach on British waters and abided by the correct regulations while passing through the Strait of Dover. A MoD spokesman estimated that a Russian warship was escorted through the Channel every few months. Russia has been suspected of military provocation as its economy continues to suffer under international sanctions. These have been imposed by the West over allegations that Moscow has been providing troops and equipment to separatist rebels in Ukraine. Many other European countries have reported what are widely seen as displays of Russian military prowess. Britain summoned the Russian ambassador for a dressing down after the long-range bombers flew over the Channel close to UK airspace last month, disrupting civil aviation and prompting Britain to scramble two Typhoon fast jets. Experts said Vladimir Putin’s move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression. More than 100 Russian aircraft were intercepted last year, three times more than during the whole of 2013. In November, HMS Tyne escorted a Russian flotilla led by the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov through the English Channel.","Russian warship was intercepted by Royal Navy as it strayed close to UK .

"A mother died after suffering a severe allergic reaction caused by L’Oreal hair dye, an inquest heard yesterday. Julie McCabe, 39, was rinsing out the dye when she ‘screamed loudly’ and gasped at her husband: ‘I’m struggling to breathe, I think I’m going to die.’ She fell into a coma and died 12 months later in hospital without regaining consciousness. Julie McCabe, 39, died after suffering an extreme reaction to L'Oreal hair dye, inquest hears . The coroner, Geoff Fell, said he believed it was only the second death in the UK resulting from hair colourant. Mrs McCabe, an estate agent, coloured her hair dark brown every month despite a long history of low-grade allergic reactions to the dye, the inquest at Skipton, North Yorkshire was told. She went to her local health centre 16 to 20 times in six years because of the issue and suffered at least ten allergic reactions to hair dye products. 2005: .

Mother-of-two suffers severe allergic reaction to the L'Oreal dye, collapses and slips into a coma. November 2012: . After over a year in a coma, the 39-year-old dies from heart failure due to brain damage. Doctors prescribed a cream to rub into her skin and scalp which dealt with the minor rashes and itchiness. None of the GPs believed her life could be in danger from her allergy. Yet she suffered an anaphylactic reaction, in what her doctor described as a ‘unique’ incident that led to fatal brain damage. Mrs McCabe’s husband Russell, 47, said he had heard his wife ‘screaming loudly from upstairs’ after going to wash out her dye. He saw her slumped against a wall gasping for air. ‘She said, “Russell, I’m struggling to breathe, I think I’m going to die”.’ He dialled 999 but became impatient with the emergency operator and decided to drive his wife the three miles to Airedale Hospital in Keighley. Mr McCabe said: ‘I went outside and discovered Julie was on her hands and knees in the driveway, gasping for breath. I just thought Julie was having a severe asthma attack.’ During the short journey from their home in Cowling, North Yorkshire, Mrs McCabe lost consciousness. Medics were working on her within seconds of Mrs McCabe arriving at hospital, but she had already suffered a major cardiac arrest. The devastated relatives of Julie McCabe arrive at her inquest in Skipton Magistrates' Court . The incident happened in October 2011. Mrs McCabe remained in a coma and died in November 2012. The cause of death was given as cardiorespiratory arrest as a result of severe brain damage. Dr Sean Emmott, one of her GPs, said she would have been advised that the way to stop the allergic reactions would be to stop using the hair dye. Dr Shuaib Nasser, an allergy expert, said: ‘The hair colouring was the cause of the severe allergic reaction.

The product used by Mrs McCabe, whose children were aged 16 and 21 when she died, was L’Oreal Recital Preference shade one. Brian Lightfoot, a chemist from L’Oreal, said the chemical para-phenylenediamine in the dye used by Mrs McCabe comprised just 1 per cent of the substance put into her hair. He said the incident was reported to the authorities as soon as the company was told about it. The inquest continues.","Julie McCabe visited her doctor up to 20 times between 2005 and 2011 .

"Hundreds of angry Amazon customers have hit out at the online retailer after finding they were being charged £79 for Prime services without realising it. The furious shoppers spoke out after being hit with the yearly charge when their 30-day free trial expired, meaning the price was raised to the regular £79-a-year rate. One Conservative councillor checked his Amazon account only to realise he had been paying for the service for five years without knowing, while another shocked subscriber said she was 'livid'. Amazon Prime customers have hit out after hundreds of customers complained that they had been charged £79-a-year for the service without realising it after their 30-day free trial expired . Hundreds of his followers responded saying they had been caught out after their free 30-day trial of Prime expired, meaning they were automatically upgraded to the £79-a-year service . All Amazon customers will be asked to sign up for a free 30-day trial of Amazon Prime at the site's digital checkout, offering them free one-day delivery on their purchases. However, reading the small print reveals that after this 30-day trial ends, buyers will be charged the £79-a-year rate, which includes movie streaming services, among other things. The unwitting subscribers were responding to a tweet by food critic and TV personality Giles Coren after he discovered he had been charged for the service for two years without using it. On Sunday he messaged his 164,000 followers saying: 'You b******* Amazon! I can't believe you've been screwing me for £79 a year for Prime! I had no idea. 'I mean, Amazon offer a free trial in 2012, then quietly start charging £79 and never tell me. That's what sicko porn sites do! I've heard...' Outspoken Times columnist Giles Coren launched a rant against Amazon after discovering he had been charged for the Prime service for two years without knowing about it . Initially customers were billed £49 per year for the service, but this was hiked to £79 in February last year after Amazon bought LoveFilm and included access to it as part of the deal. Jeremy Bellamy, a Conservative councillor for Barton in Canterbury, said: 'I noticed just after Christmas that they'd been charging me for it... for about the last four or five years I think?' Amazon customers can tell if they've signed up to Prime by going to the My Account section of the site, located in the top right hand corner of the homepage. Once there, scroll down the page until you see the 'Settings' section, then look under the 'Account settings' column for a option called 'Manage Prime Membership'. Once you have clicked on that, a new page will open up, telling you whether you are signed up to Prime, how long you have been a member, and who is being charged. If you want to end your membership, there will be a button on this page allowing you to do this. If you think you have been wrongly charged for Prime, you can apply for a refund via the customer services page. Lauranne Pearce, from Derbyshire, added: 'I've just checked and yep £79 lighter and didn't even know it. I can't even remember signing up!' Meanwhile Sally Roberts, from London, said she was 'livid' after also being caught out. Mr Coren, who has become known for his often savage restaurant reviews and rants against sub-editors of his column at The Times, added: 'Come on people, check your Amazon accounts. 'If you're being secretly f***** by 'Prime' let me know. It's a class action waiting to happen.' Amazon has long received complaints over its practice of automatically charging customers after the free trial expired, with website moneysavingexpert.com speaking about it back in 2009. In recent weeks the UK service has also been attacked for being the most expensive in Europe after it was revealed customers in Italy pay just £7.50 per year for Prime. Amazon say that the UK Prime service includes access to hundreds of movies and TV shows to stream online, as well as online space for storing pictures, and the ability to borrow Kindle books. The UK service also includes free one-day delivery on millions of items, while Italian Prime only includes free 2-3 day delivery. However UK customers are not given the option of taking the cheaper service if they do not want to use all the features of UK Prime. Mr Coren branded Amazon 'highwaymen' and 'corporate rapists' after he discovered the charge, which is explained in the small print on Amazon's website (right) An Amazon spokesman said: 'Customers who sign up to a free trial of Prime receive an email informing them of the duration of the free trial and how to avoid continuing to paid Prime Membership. 'Customers who become full Prime members can cancel their membership at any time and we will refund the full membership if the customer has not made any eligible purchases or used any Prime benefits. 'So as long as you haven’t used the free delivery, downloaded or streamed any videos through the service, or borrowed a Kindle book, you can simply cancel the membership and reclaim the subscription.' Amazon did offer Mr Coren a refund online today after saying he had misunderstood the terms and conditions, but he refused, adding that he wasn't asking to be reimbursed, but was informing his followers of the practice.","Customers complained that price rose to £79 a year after free trial expired .

"One of two Wisconsin girls accused of stabbing a classmate to please the horror character Slender Man should only face a lesser charge in juvenile court because she thought she had to kill her friend to protect herself and her family from the creature, her attorney argued on Monday. Anissa Weier, then 12, and her friend Morgan Geyser were arrested after allegedly stabbing their friend 19 times and leaving her in the woods on May 31, 2014. Each girl faces one count of being a party to first-degree intentional attempted homicide in adult court in connection with the May incident. Scroll down for video . An attorney for Anissa Walker, pictured in court last June, told a Wisconsin court on Monday that her client believed the fictional character was real and that she had to protect herself . Anissa Weier, left, and her friend Morgan Geyser, right, were arrested after allegedly stabbing their friend 19 times and leaving her in the woods on May 31, 2014 . Their cases have reached the preliminary hearing stage, where a judge decides whether enough evidence exists to order a trial. Defense attorney Anthony Cotton began the two-day proceeding by declaring that the evidence will show his client, Weier, should really face a second-degree attempted intentional homicide charge in juvenile court. He argued that she believed she had to kill 12-year-old Peyton Leutner because she had a deal with Slender Man that called for her and her co-defendant to kill someone so they could become the creature's servants. If they didn't follow through, Slender Man — described in online horror sites as standing between 6 feet and 14 feet tall with tendrils sprouting from his back — would attack both girls and their families. Cotton tried to show the girl believed Slender Man was real, introducing multiple sketches of him from her notebook. The drawings were accompanied with phrases such as 'never alone,' ''safer dead' and 'can't run.' Waukesha Police Detective Shelly Fisher testified that Leutner had recounted how she had wanted to end her friendship with Weier because the girl had become obsessed with Slender Man and was getting 'scarier and scarier and weirder and weirder.' Victim Peyton Leutner told police she had wanted to end her friendship with Weier because the girl had become obsessed with Slender Man and was getting 'scarier and scarier and weirder and weirder' Morgen Geyser, pictured above in June 2014,  was 12 during the attack and has since turned 13. Her attorneys tried to paint her as a terrified tag-along on Monday . 'It's absolutely clear (the girl) believes in him,' Cotton told reporters outside court. However, Waukesha Police Detective Thomas Casey testified that Weier told him that her co-defendant Geyser believed Slender Man would kill them and their families if they didn't go through with the stabbing. Later, she said she didn't know why they did what they did. The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009. The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia. It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport. It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009. It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'. The detective said the browser history on Cotton's client's family computer showed searches on how to get away with murder. During the interview, she asked him if he was going to cut off her head, he said. 'I think (the girl) had an infatuation with death and killing,' Casey said. The two girls blamed each other during initial interviews with the police, detectives testified. Weier accused her friend of stabbing Leutner first, Casey testified, even though Leutner told detectives that Weier did all the stabbing. Geyser was 12 during the attack and has since turned 13. Her attorneys tried to paint her as a terrified tag-along. Detective Michelle Trussoni testified that Geyser told her she refused to kill Leutner and turned her back during the attack. Weier was led into court in shackles, wearing a plaid button-up shirt over a Batman T-shirt. She spent much of the day hunched over the defense table, scribbling on a legal pad. Geyser was in shackles as well. She wore dark slacks, a dark jacket and a green shirt. She sat up straight during most of the proceedings. The defense teams were expected to present their witnesses on Tuesday. It's unclear when Judge Michael Boren will make a decision on a trial. Prosecutors ended the day on Monday by asking him to review some six hours of videotaped interrogations. According to court documents, the girls told detectives they had been planning to kill Leutner for months. They lured her to a park on May 31, where she was stabbed 19 times. The alleged attackers were found walking toward the Nicolet National Forest, where they say they thought they would join Slender Man.","Anissa Weier, then 12, and Morgan Geyser are accused of stabbing their friend Peyton Leutner  19 times  on May 31, 2014 .

"Women going through the menopause may suffer hot flushes for as long as 14 years, warn researchers. They found half the women in a large study had uncomfortable, often distressing symptoms for more than seven years on average. US experts said greater efforts are needed to find new ways of helping women at the menopause as HRT is currently recommended for five years of maximum use. Nancy Avis, a professor of social sciences and health policy at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, North Carolina, and the study’s lead author, said doctors should advise women that vasomotor symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats might last longer than they had been led to believe. Women going through the menopause may suffer hot flushes for as long as 14 years, warn researchers . She said ‘The duration of 7.4 years highlights the limitations of guidance recommending short-term hormone therapy and emphasises the need to identify safe long-term therapies for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms.’ In the UK, the average age of the menopause is 51 years, when periods stop and oestrogen hormone levels decline. The study of 1,449 women with frequent hot flushes or night sweats is the largest study of its kind and included four ethnic groups. The average length of time women endured symptoms was 7.4 years. Half of the women were affected for less than that time, but half had symptoms longer — some for at least 14 years, researchers reported in JAMA Internal Medicine (must credit). Overall, African-American and Hispanic women experienced hot flashes significantly longer than white or Asian women. The study found that the earlier hot flushes started the longer they lasted. Researchers found half the women in a large study had uncomfortable, often distressing symptoms for more than seven years on average. For women who got hot flushes before they stopped menstruating, they were likely to continue for years after the menopause, longer than for women whose symptoms only began when their periods had stopped. In the study, one in eight women began getting hot flushes while still having regular periods. For two-thirds of women, they began in perimenopause, the period of time before the menopause sets in when periods become more scant. Women who started getting hot flushes when they were still having regular periods or were in early perimenopause experienced symptoms for around 11.8 years. About nine of those years occurred after menopause, nearly three times the average of 3.4 years for women whose hot flushes did not start until their periods stopped. Prof Avis said ‘If you start later it’s a shorter total duration, and it’s shorter from the last period on.’ The study also found that women with longer-lasting symptoms tended to have less education, greater perceived stress, and more depression and anxiety. Hot flushes (known as flashes in the US) are caused by dilation of the blood vessels and increased flow of blood to the head and neck, causing reddening of the skin and sweating. Night sweats are hot flushes that take place at bedtime, disrupting sleep and causing fatigue and stress. Studies have found that women with hot flush symptoms also face increased risk of cardiovascular problems and bone loss. Researchers followed the women in the study, who came from seven American cities, from 1996 to 2013. All of them met the researchers’ definition for having frequent symptoms: hot flushes or night sweats at least six days in the previous two weeks. None had had a hysterectomy or both ovaries removed and none were on hormone therapy. The study comprised of women from different ethnic groups living in America, including African-Americans, Japanese and Chinese descent and Hispanic as well as white women and reasons for variation in the length of menopause between the groups were unclear, said the researchers. Dr JoAnn E. Manson, chief of preventive medicine at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an author of a commentary on the study, said ‘Women with more stress in their lives may be more aware of their symptoms and perceive them to be more bothersome. ‘But also having significant night sweats that interrupt sleep can lead to stress’ she added.","Researchers found half the women in study had symptoms for seven years .

"Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords has posted an inspirational video of her singing a duet with her music therapist, four years after a would-be assassin shot her in the head. 'Great to be back at Houston's TIRR Memorial Hermann and sing a few lines from ""Annie"" with my friend and former music therapist, Maegan,' Giffords wrote on Facebook. 'Wonderful people work here, and they do so much to help others get better' Scroll down for video . Sing when you're winning: Former congresswoman Gabby Giffords has posted an inspirational video of her singing with her music therapist, Maegan, right, four years after she was shot in the head . The short clip shows the politician-cum-gun control campaigner smiling and raising her one good arm as she trills lines from the musical's stand-out number, It's A Hard Knock Life. Singing has been an important part of her rehab, the New York Daily News reports. Six people were killed and 13 wounded, including Ms Giffords, when Jared Loughner opened fire at a Tucson shopping center car park where she was giving a stump speech. Ms Giffords, who took a bullet to the head at point-blank range, still struggles to speak and walk. Her arm and leg remain paralyzed and she also has vision problems. She has become a standard-bearer for the controversial issue of gun control after co-founding Americans for Responsible Solutions with her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. The gun control group raised millions for congressional candidates in the 2014 election, including Ron Barber, who replaced Ms Giffords in Congress after she was shot but lost his seat to Republican Martha McSally. The group has garnered attention nationwide but has been able to do little to change gun laws. Long road to recovery: Ms Giffords in hospital after she was shot in the head at point-blank range . Monster: Jared Loughner, right, was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting. His youngest victim was nine-year-old Christina  Green, pictured right with her mother, Roxanna Green . The January 8, 2011, shooting shook Tucson, a city that considers itself a tight-knit community despite its half-million residents. Among those killed was 9-year-old Christina Green, whose face adorns many of the memorial messages left at the shooting site and the hospital. U.S. District Judge John Roll and Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman were also killed. Loughner was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting. Organizers with the January 8th Memorial, a nonprofit foundation, are in the final phase of selecting a designer for a permanent memorial to the victims. The foundation hopes to finish the memorial this year, manager Michelle Crow said. It will be at El Presidio Park in downtown Tucson, but there are plans for other exhibits. Ms Crow said she wants the community to be closely involved in the selectin of the design and final memorial. 'People remember the day. They remember when they heard. They want to remember what happened that day, and they want to take part in an activity to commemorate that anniversary,' she told The Associated Press.","Former congresswoman was visiting TIRR Memorial Hermann hospital .

"Employment minister Esther McVey today admitted she wanted to become Prime Minister. The glamorous former TV presenter, appearing on ITV’s Loose Women this afternoon, said she wanted to see more women in top jobs. Miss McVey was asked by Janet Street Porter – who was the MP’s boss when she started in television – if she had designs on Number 10. The Tory cabinet minister said: ‘To be honest, it is not as simple as that. But if I had to do a yes or no I’ll be honest and say “yes”.’ Employment minister Esther McVey told the panelists on ITV's Loose Women that she wanted to become Prime Minister . David Cameron was asked about Miss McVey’s admission today. He said there was ‘lots of talent in Tory Party’. He said he did not want to put a ‘limit on anyone's ambition’. Miss McVey, who is not married and has no children, had earlier admitted making ‘sacrifices’ to succeed in politics. Panellist Jamelia Niela Davis said: ‘Do you not feel that it is different as a woman being in politics – that it is much more difficult, that you do have to make different sacrifices to men?’ She said: ‘I guess we all do sacrifices in one way or another. I have other sacrifices – I live between two places, it’s difficult because there are always lots of people wanting to criticise what you do. ‘So there are sacrifices there. But if you want to do and you believe in it then I say have the courage of your convictions and go for it.’ The minister added: ‘Those are sacrifices I am prepared to give because I believe in the cause.’ Miss McVey was asked by Janet Street Porter – who was the MP’s boss when she started in television – if she had designs on Number 10. She was also asked about not having children by panellist Jamelia . Loose Women presenters Ruth Langsford and Coleen Nolan questioned Miss McVey about her plans to inspire young girls to aim higher . Miss McVey appeared on the programme to push her new campaign to break open traditionally male professions for women. It comes after she said girls should be encouraged to run around and climb trees as it could help them have more confidence at the workplace in later life. Miss McVey said there is evidence men are more likely to put themselves forward for promotion at work, because they have been 'pushing the boundaries' from a young age. A traditional upbringing in which boys tear around and make dens, but girls sit quietly with their parents has an impact in later life, with women sometimes reluctant to put themselves forward because they are 'looking for acceptance', she said. Recent research has shown that men are more likely to embellish their CVs than women when applying for a job. Miss McVey said girls should be encouraged to run around and climb trees as it could help them have more confidence at the workplace in later life . Head-hunters have also said they check men's CVs for longer than women's because men are more likely to exaggerate their experience while women underplay theirs. 'There is an element of confidence there', the Conservative cabinet minister said. 'I thought it was very revealing that head-hunters check through a woman's CV for something like 25 minutes to analyse because the chances are she will play down her achievements. 'Whereas it can take two-and-a-half hours to check a bloke's because they'll write about things as if they have done them, when in fact that would be a promotion', she said in an interview with the Mail. David Cameron, asked about Miss McVey's admission, said he did not want to put a limit on anyone's ambition . 'I think girls, whether it's the way they're brought up, they sit quietly beside mum and dad and speak when they're spoken to, and boys are allowed to run around outside and climb trees and make dens, and that actually does have an impact later on in life where girls are frequently looking for acceptance by others, whereas boys are much more naturally pushing the boundaries.' Miss McVey will appear on ITV's Loose Women tomorrow as part of a series on election issues. She will launch the #notjustforboys campaign, intended to boost the number of women in jobs where they are under-represented such as construction science, IT and engineering in which 12million jobs will be created in the next decade. The minister said these choices need to be influenced at a young age. As well as their upbringing, she said girls need to be encouraged to choose 'the right subjects at GCSE and A-Level so you don't limit your choices later in life, because these are the fast-growing areas, the ones with the greatest opportunities and the ones paying the most money', she said. 'That's where advanced economies are going, we've got to make sure our young people are up to speed and can compete in the jobs market.' She said misconceptions that tech industries were not glamorous were being rapidly broken down, and girls working in IT were increasingly being seen as 'the new It girls'. 'I would like to think the IT girl is the new It girl', she said. 'It is about being powerful and creative, not just an attractive image but being in charge of your own destiny. 'There's a lot of people who are getting to 18 or 20 and saying if only I'd known, if only I'd got the right subject grades at a levels I would have taken those options. We just want to make sure that girls are going forward. 'Among engineering professionals only 7 per cent of women are working in that area. Yes it has gone up since 2011, but that's 93 per cent of women who might think ""I would have done that"". 'So many people like to use the latest phones or programmes, we are saying don't just be the consumer of technology, be the creator and think of the opportunities that will open up for you.'","Esther McVey said 'yes' when asked if she wanted to be Prime Minister .

He underwent surgery and was kept in intensive care but was today believed to be out of danger. Mr Milley is studying Spanish and economics in Salamanca. It is believed that his friends accompanied him to the hospital after he was injured and that his mother, Marilyn, was on her way to see her son in Spain. Scroll down for video . Ole Miss student Ben Milley, 20, from Marietta, Georgia, was injured during bull-running at a festival in Ciudad Rodrigo, Spain on Saturday. He underwent surgery for a 16-inch wound to his thigh but was believed to be out of danger. His mother, Marilyn, (pictured right) was on her way to Spain to see her son . The student, from Marietta, Georgia, underwent a three-hour operation to repair damage to his thighs, sphincter and back muscles . Surgeon Enrique Crespo was called to operate on Milley after he suffered serious injuries to his thighs, sphincter and back during the bull-running event in Ciudad Rodrigo . American Benjamin Milley, 20, (above) was hurt at the Carnaval del Toro festival in Ciudad Rodrigo, Spain . Calls to Mr Milley's family in Georgia went unanswered on Tuesday. Mr Milley's father, Ethan, is a managing director at financial services firm JLL. A spokesman for the University of Mississippi told Daily Mail Online that they hadn't heard from the family so could offer no updates on the student's health. However Ole Miss confirmed that Mr Milley was a sophomore at the college who was currently studying abroad with a program at the Institute for the International Education of Students. A family member, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Daily News: 'We had heard from them (Milley’s parents) what had happened, but we didn’t understand the magnitude until we saw the pictures.' The terrifying images showed the student being tossed around by the bull before he was dragged to the side of the road by other participants and spectators. Mr Milley suffered injuries to his sphincter and numerous hemorrhages, according to doctors at Clinic Hospital in western Salamanca. He had a three-hour operation for injuries to his thighs, sphincter and back. Surgeon Enrique Crespo was called to operate on Milley after he was injured on the first day of the annual festival. Crespo said: 'It's not the worst injury I've seen, but it's the biggest goring wound I've ever had to operate on.' He was believed not to have to undergo any more surgeries.

The now 20-year-old student was hospitalized in Spain on Saturday and underwent surgery after being gored by a bull . Ben Milley (pictured left) is believed to be out of danger but spent time in intensive care following his bull goring injuries . Two other unidentified men were hurt during Saturday's festivities. Town councilor Pedro Munoz said: 'One man from Scotland and a Spaniard from Salamanca were also injured.' The injured Scot is 46 years old and the wounded Spaniard is 31. Munoz added: 'Doctor Crespo is a world-renowned expert and we have a medically-equipped helicopter on standby every day of our annual fiesta.' The 20-year-old student was injured on Saturday on the first day of the event and had to have emergency surgery after going to the event with a group of friends . Milley was helped by other revelers after being tossed and gored by a bull during the Carnaval del Toro . The festival is an annual event in Ciudad Rodrigo that celebrates the world of bullfighting, according to the Tourist Office of Spain in the U.S. Fiestas featuring bulls are common in Spain, and critics and aficionados alike agree that the events, which attract international audiences, are dangerous. Munoz said somewhere between 45,000 and 50,000 people had been attracted over the weekend to this year's four-day fiesta, that includes afternoon bullfights and bull-running events. Ciudad Rodrigo — population 14,000 — is a small cathedral city close to the Portuguese border that is a popular tourist destination. It retains its ancient defensive walls and was the site of key battles between Napoleon's army and British forces under the command of the Duke of Wellington from 1810 to 1812. The 20-year-old Ole Miss student has been recovering from his injuries in the Clinic Hospital in western Salamanca. Doctors have said he is out of trouble and is not likely to require any more surgeries . In addition to the American student two other people were hurt yesterday including a 46-year-old man from Scotland and a 31-year-old man from Salamanca .","Ben Milley, 20, from Marietta, Georgia, suffered severe injuries, including a 16-inch wound in the thigh .

"The BBC lavished nearly £7million on consultants last year – but has refused to say what they did for the money. The bill follows a promise made by BBC boss Tony Hall to rein in spending on external management ‘experts’. A freedom of information request revealed that the consultancy bill for the 12 months to May 2014 was an improvement on the £10.4million the BBC spent the previous year. The BBC has spent nearly £7million on consultants last year, despite director general Tony Hall, pictured, promising to rein in spending . However, that bill was considerably higher than the £5million it spent the year before that. The BBC said some of the money covered the auditing of its annual accounts, but would not disclose how the rest was spent. ‘We are legally obliged to use external organisations to audit our accounts', said a spokesman. Conservative MP Philip Davies has called for the corporation to be more transparent about how they spend their money . ‘On occasion, just like any other large organisation, we also use external companies for specialist services - this saves the BBC millions of pounds because it is cheaper than employing permanent, full-time staff to carry out work which would only last a short period. However, MPs said the Corporation has a duty to do explain where its fees have gone. ‘If they want to be feather-bedded by a licence fee, they need to be transparent about how they spend it,’ said Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire. The BBC added that it uses a competitive tender process to choose which firms to hire. Lord Hall has in the past faced accusations of ‘cronyism’ after he handed a £600,000 management consultancy contract to a friend. In 2013, he appointed Suzanne Heywood to lead a two-month McKinsey review into making the corporation a ‘simpler place to work’. Lord Hall worked with Lady Heywood, who is married to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, at the Royal Opera House before he joined the BBC as director-general. In 2013 he told MPs that he would not be ‘an easy ride’ for consultants, and pledged to cut back on contracts with firms like Deloitte, Accenture, McKinsey & Co, and KPMG. ‘I want to reduce the amount of money that we pay on consultants, I really do. I am not an easy ride when it comes to consultants,’ he said.","FoI request revealed the BBC spent £7million on consultants during 2014 .

Alan Knight, the chief executive of IAR, said: 'It’s hard to believe this healthy young infant is the same poor creature we found lying on his back in a cage, completely unable to move or sit up. 'When Budi was rescued he was so weak and fragile that we all feared he wouldn’t survive. But he has proved to be a real fighter and is now safely on the road to recovery. 'He still has a long way to go but his pain has subsided, the swelling in his body and limbs has disappeared, he has a healthy appetite and is becoming more energetic and active by the day.' Budi is just one of the many orangutans exposed to appalling conditions in Borneo, where their natural habitats are increasingly under threat. Many are orphaned during logging operations and the orphans kept as pets, with the people supposed to be looking after them entirely unaware of their needs. Open wide: Budi had been unable to even open and close his mouth but is now feeding well at the sanctuary in Borneo which has rescued him and which depends on donations to help him and other animals . In training: Eventually vets will be able to see if Budi can swing through the trees like his relatives in the wild . Sleeping well: At first Budi would scream in pain if touched but is now settling into a more normal life . In Budi's case he was given just condensed milk, which meant that when the charity was contacted by his owner, he did not know how to chew, and his limbs - thanks to his poor diet - were misshapen, weak and swollen. His owner, who lives in Kubing, in the Ketapang area of Western Borneo, had admitted he was ill when she asked for help from the charity. Since his rescue Budi has learned how to eat properly, as he has gained the muscle strength to open and close his mouth, and been given physiotherapy to overcome the problems in his legs and arms. Although he is yet to return to the trees where his species should live, the charity is hopeful of more progress. At just over a year, Budi is still a baby, and a normal orangutan will not climb trees unassisted until they are around two, when they move in the branches by holding hands with other orangutans. In the wild the apes will be weaned around the age of four, and a year later begin to spend time away from their mothers. The typical orangutan lifespan in captivity or the wild is around 30 years, and 45 years is towards the top of expectations. The oldest recorded lifespan was Guas, who died aged 59 at the Philadelphia Zoo, Pennsylvania, in 1977, the Los Angeles Times reported. Budi's recovery will take many years and it is still too early to tell if he will be able to survive in the wild, his rescuers say. The charity estimates it will cost about £5,000 a year to care for the little orangutan and he is likely to need six or seven years of rehabilitation before he can even be considered for release into the wild. If Budi does not regain the strength he will need to fend for himself in the forest, International Animal Rescue will have to cover the cost of caring for him in their sanctuary for the rest of his life. It has already received tens of thousands of dollars in donations for Budi and other animals' plight, but says more are welcome. International Animal Rescue, the British charity based in Uckfield, East Sussex saves animals, big and small, from suffering around the world. Work includes freeing and caring for dancing bears in India, rescuing primates from captivity in Indonesia, and sterilising and vaccinating stray dogs and cats in developing countries. Wherever possible, the charity returns rescued animals to their natural environment but it also provides a permanent home for those that can no longer survive in the wild. International Animal Rescue works to educate the public in the compassionate and humane treatment of all animals. Sound scientiﬁc evidence forms the basis of its decision-making and determines the course of its rescue operations. It also works with other like-minded organisations and government departments to strengthen legislation to protect animals from cruelty and neglect.","Endangered ape spent ten months in a chicken coop cage in Borneo .

"It's nearing 'crunch time' for Greece and the eurozone and failure to reach a deal over the country's bailout would be 'very severe for economic and financial stability', according to Britain's Finance Minister George Osborne. However, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras today signalled little intention of backing down from Greece's clash with its euro zone partners, despite a looming financial crisis. Tsipras said his government would not succumb to 'blackmail' and would instead quickly start voting in new laws to reverse bailout reforms. Defiant: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (pictured) signalled little intention of backing down from Greece's clash with its euro zone partners, despite a looming financial crisis . Ignoring calls from across Europe to compromise on a plan to extend Greece's bailout programme, he said he was confident a deal on the country's future would ultimately be found but that Athens would not climb down from its pre-election pledges. 'We are not in a hurry and we will not compromise,' Tsipras told his party's lawmakers in parliament. 'We are working hard for an honest and mutually beneficial deal, a deal without austerity, without the bailout which has destroyed Greece in recent years, a deal without the toxic presence of the (bailout inspecting) troika.' Tsipras said his parliament would start voting in bills this week to implement campaign pledges of protecting primary residences from foreclosures and banning the sale of mortgage loans to distressed funds. A bill reversing labour reform and restoring collective bargaining agreements scrapped by European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders would soon be presented alongside another one to deal with the 'humanitarian crisis' in Greece, he said. The current bailout runs out in two weeks, and the EU had originally said Greece would have to demand an extension to the loan by yesterday. But, following the collapse of a meeting in Brussels, European officials gave the newly elected radical Left government in Athens another three days, with the possibility of another meeting on Friday. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the Eurogroup of 19 countries using the common currency, stuck to his guns, however, saying Athens must seek an extension. 'It's really up to the Greeks,' he said. 'We cannot make them or ask them. We stand ready to work with them, also (over) the next couple of days.' If no deal is reached, Greece will be unable to service its debt and could run out of cash, meaning it would not be able to pay its civil servants or fund pensions. Economists have warned that this could see the country being forced out of the euro, which would spark a crisis in the eurozone and have damaging knock-on effects for the UK economy. Osborne said 'we're reaching crunch time for Greece and the eurozone' and warned failure to reach a deal would be 'very severe for economic and financial stability'. Echoing the alarm EU officials have voiced about the negotiating tactics of the left-wing government Greeks elected last month to end hated austerity programmes, Osborne added: 'What Britain really needs to see is competence, not chaos.' 'Crunch time': Jeroen Dijsselbloem (left), the Dutch finance minister who chairs the Eurogroup, said Greece must seek an extension, while George Osborne (right) warned failure to reach a deal would be 'very severe for economic and financial stability' Greece's Left-wing Syriza government wants the country's bailout to be restructured, with an end to many austerity demands. The International Monetary Fund and European Union say there should be no change to the terms of the current £178billion loan. Despite all the tough talk and ultimatums, Greece and its creditors in the eurozone are still expected to cobble together some sort of deal that will allow the country to remain a member of the euro currency. 'If Greece were to leave the euro, the financial chaos that would follow could also spell the end of the Syriza-led government,' said Jane Foley, analyst at Rabobank International. 'For this reason it remains our central view that an eleventh hour compromise between Greece and its creditors is still likely.' The current bailout expires on February 28. Any new agreement would have to be approved by national governments, so time is running out to reach a compromise. While the stock index in Athens declined only modestly Tuesday, Greece's government borrowing rates are rising steadily - a sign investors are more wary of a potential bankruptcy. Economists at Commerzbank estimate that falling out of the currency union would see Greece's economy shrink another 10 per cent. That is on top of the 25 per cent it has already plunged since the crisis, putting it through a downturn similar to the U.S. Depression of the 1930s. A new currency would fall sharply in value, meaning painfully higher prices for imports like medicine and gas. Companies' debts in euros would swell, forcing many into bankruptcy. In the rest of the eurozone, taxpayers would be handed big losses on bailout loans their governments gave Greece. The eurozone bailout fund - a pot of money backed by taxpayers - is owed €142billion, individual countries are owed €53billion, and the European Central Bank €20billion. The Greek central bank owes another €50billion to eurozone central banks.","Greek PM says deal will be found but he won't renege  pre-election pledges .

"Longtime Obama administration political insider David Axelrod claimed on Monday that the Obama administration hasn't been tainted by a smidgen of scandal. The surprising boast came during a Q&A at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics, an organization he founded and leads. 'I'm proud of the fact that basically you have had an administration in place for six years in which there hasn’t been a major scandal,' Axelrod said. 'And I think that says a lot about the ethical strictures of this administration.' Audio and video of Axelrod's remarks indicate the audience's first reaction to his insistence that Obama has presided over a scandal-free government was a chorus of laughs – before friendly attendees quickly drowned them out with applause. Conservatives have made a parlor game out of cataloging the Obama White House's scandals, with tallies running into the dozens and some organized alphabetically. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . GREEN CARDS: Millions of illegal immigrants will have IDs and become mainstreamed into the US population under a policy Obama put into place without input from Congress, sparking a Constitutional-crisis scandal . A leaked slideshow about the National Security Agency snooping on domestic Internet traffic grew into a major international scandal in 2013 . Among the administration's earliest media firestorms was its green-energy loan guarantees to Solyndra and other alternative-energy companies. Solyndra ultimately defaulted on $527 million in loans that the federal government guaranteed, leaving taxpayers on the hook for the money. In April 2009 a White House official green-lighted a photo-op that featured Air Force One, Obama's private plan, doing a flyby in New York City past the Statue of Liberty. Panicked New Yorkers flooded the streets thinking another 9/11-style aircraft attack was underway. Also early in his presidency – on Day One – was a pledge to shut down the military detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. That effort has led to 115 prisoner releases, including several later confirmed to have re-entered hostilities against the West. Last year the president traded five high-value Taliban detainees for the safe return of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who is now expected to be charged with desertion for walking away from his Afghanistan post in 2009. Military veterans who return home under more typical circumstances were shocked to learn in 2014 that dozens were dying for lack of medical care through the Veterans Administration health system. REMEMBER SOLYNDRA? $527 million later, the company is bankrupt and US taxpayers had to cover itsload defaults . The Internal Revenue Service, Americans' most feared and loathed government agency, has had a bumper crop of scandals since Obama took office. In May 2013 an inspector general report found that the agency spent more than $4.1 million on a single conference in California that included six-figure fees for speakers and expensive video production for a corny Star-Trek themed humor video. The General Services Administration was caught in a similar conference scandal later that year over an $823,000 in Las Vegas training conference held in 2010. It featured mind-readers, a clown and lavish hotel suites with jacuzzis. The GSA administration resigned over the flap. Also in May 2013, the IRS was plunged into scandal over news that its Tax-Exempt Organizations section was subjecting Tea Party groups and conservative-oriented charities to intrusive screening and years-long delays before granting them tax-exempt status – while liberal groups were often given a pass. The IRS later claimed to Congress that years worth of emails belonging to retired official Lois Lerner, who is thought to be responsible, were destroyed in a hard drive crash. Americans had a civil-liberties awakening in June 2013 that grew into an international scandal, when former government contractor Edward Snowden fled the country with untold amounts of stolen data and gave journalists evidence of a massive global eavesdropping program run by the National Security Agency. Called Project PRISM, its tentacles reached into industry, private citizens' emails and even the cellphone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Outrage over the program put the NSA on a tighter congressional leash. 'WHAT DIFFERENCE ... DOES IT MAKE?' Hillary Clinton's State Department still has questions pending about Benghazi, and the former secretary of state was never interviewed by investigators . The White House's own black eyes continued with other revelations related to domestic spying on American citizens, including members of the press. The Justice Department under Attorney General Eric Holder, it was revealed, had tapped the phones of Associated Press reporters and scoured emails belonging to a Fox News Channel correspondent, all without notifying the affected news organizations. The ensuing scandal forced Holder to convene apologetic meetings with journalists and news executives in which he and his deputies pledged to follow a more transparent route in the future when dealing with the Fourth Estate. The attorney general was already reeling from a series of revelations about Operation Fast and Furious, a failed effort to track illegal U.S. gun sales to Mexican drug lords that resulted in hundreds of deaths south of the border and the killing of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry. Holder's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives instructed legitimate gun dealers to sell illegal quantities of rifles, shotguns and handguns to 'straw buyers,' whom they knew would take the guns into Mexico for use by narcotics cartels. Of the 2,100 guns trafficked into Mexico in this fashion, just over 700 were recovered. Holder was held in Contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents subpoenaed by lawmakers. He was also accused of committing perjury when he claimed in a congressional hearing that he had only learned about Fast and Furious weeks earlier. Documents later proved otherwise. President Obama's Affordable Care Act was a signature legislative accomplishment but remains shrouded in controversy and scandal. The Benghazi siege killed a US ambassador; the Obama White House initially spun the terror attack as an out-of-control protest over a YouTube video . After the president pledged dozens of times that Americans who liked their existing health insurance plans could keep them under his new system, millions found themselves with cancellation letters because their older policies fell short of the government's minimum requirements. Those included birth-control and breast cancer coverage for men and prostate exams for women on single-person policies. Obamacare also became a punchline when billions of dollars failed to produce a working website in the fall of 2013 when open-enrollment for government-brokered medical insurance policies opened up. By then, the administration had already angered members of Congress by unilaterally pushing back implementation dates that were written into the law he signed. Some of those impromptu delays pushed back key outcomes – including the massive wave of insurance policy cancellations – until after the 2012 election. In late 2014 the GOP got another chance to raise a ruckus about the Obamacare law when its self-proclaimed 'architect' Jonathan Gruber was caught on video saying that it only passed Congress because of 'the stupidity of the American voter.' Overseas, the administration's role in failures related to the September 11, 2012 terror attack in Benghazi is still the subject of scandal, with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton eyeing a presidential run of her own. Under Clinton, the State Department refused to provide added security for the diplomatic compound that would later be firebombed and attacked in a coordinated paramilitary assault, killing three Americans including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. Afterward, with a presidential election just weeks away, Obama and Clinton both claimed the attack was the product of a spontaneous escalation of protests related to a crude YouTube video that mocked the Muslim prophet Muhammad. Protests in other countries throughout the Arab world did take place after the film was publicized online. FIVE-FOR-ONE: Obama consoled Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's parents at the White House after giving away five Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo to get him home, but the soldier's comrades later said he was a deserter . But the Benghazi attack, it emerged after the election, was planned and executed by Ansar al-Shariah, an affiliate of al-Qaeda. A scandal-within-a-scandal erupted when ti was proven that the CIA and White House insiders both edited a set of 'talking points' used by the administration to brief Congress and talk to reporters. Those changes removed all references to the Islamist and jihadi groups that intelligence officials knew were responsible. Some analysts believe Obama's re-election was cinched when an ABC News anchor incorrectly said during a debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney that the president had called the event a 'terrorist attack' the day after it occurred. RIP: US Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was gunned down by a Mexican drug cartel member who was armed with an Operation Fast and Furious rifle that US government supplied . Clinton later raised senators' hackles when she asked 'What difference does it make?' whether or not the deadly attack was the careful work of terrorists. More recently the president's executive actions on immigration have become the stuff of scandal intense enough to spur federal lawsuits filed by 26 sitting governors and the Republican-led House of Representatives. Obama has begun already to offer green cards and work permits to millions of people who were brought to the United States illegally as children. He has proposed to expand that program dramatically, guaranteeing millions more that they won't be deported during his term in office. A federal judge on Monday night blocked that plan – which Obama himself said more than 20 times he lacked to legal authority to carry out – but the final say will rest with the Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court. Other more minor blips on America's scandal radar since 2009 included former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson using a private email address – complete with an alias – to conduct agency business. Those emails, unlike messages archived from official government accounts, weren't subject to retention policies and could not be subpoenaed. Obama was also hammered for appointing Timothy Geithner as his first Treasury Secretary, since Geithner had failed to pay his own taxes years earlier. And in January 2012 he created a scandal by making presidential 'recess appointments' of key personnel who required congressional approval while Congress was still in session. The move allowed his appointees to serve for a year without being confirmed on Capitol Hill. Four federal courts later ruled that the actions were unconstitutional, including a unanimous 9–0 Supreme Court ruling.","Senior political operative was speaking at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics, which he founded and leads .

"What could be more heart-breaking than for your beloved dog to disappear one day, never to return, and for you never to find out what happened? But that is what is now possible as a result of a decision by the Highways’ Agency, which used to stipulate that any dog found dead on a major road should be checked for identification and, where possible, the owner informed of the animal’s fate. To save costs, the agency’s new contracts do not include such mandatory checks, although any driver who hits a dog is required by law to report the incident to the police. Keeping them close: Devoted Jenni Murray cuddles two of her chihuahuas . Clearly this doesn’t always happen, which is what led Jude Devine from Sheffield to spend 13 agonising weeks searching for her miniature poodle Harvey, who had gone missing while she was visiting friends. Eventually she was told by a kind Highways Officer that Harvey had been found dead on the M62 only 20 minutes after he had gone missing. If only someone had told her at the outset, it would have saved her three months of desperate anxiety and the £8,000 she spent on living in a caravan close to the search area. That’s how much an owner can love a dog. It’s for that reason she is calling for the Department of Transport to introduce a ‘Harvey’s Law’ to require compulsory scanning of any domestic animal found on a road and make sure a report is filed with the police. It will seem ridiculous to anyone who doesn’t understand what a dog can mean to its owner to make a comparison with a child, but I’m going to do it with my dog. No one would dream of suggesting that a child hit by a car should simply be disposed of without anyone being required to inform the parents and, I believe, the same caring attitude should apply to the demise of a dog. I know exactly what Jude Devine went through when Harvey disappeared without trace. My first dog was a corgi-cross called Taffy. After much pestering and endless reading of Enid Blyton’s Shadow The Sheepdog, Mum finally relented and Taffy, a tiny, ginger pup with floppy ears and a long waggy tail, was my fifth birthday present. We went everywhere together. We walked in the woods and loafed in the garden. He chased the balls I threw and sat when I told him to. He was not, unlike Enid Blyton’s Shadow, allowed to sleep on my bed, but I did sneak him into the bedroom and he lay on the rug by my side. Microchips can be used to identify a lost or dead dog and notify families . For an only child he was the most devoted and constant companion. He was never cross with me, always deliriously excited to see me (he even went to the door when he knew I was due home) and, as I grew into a teenager, he was my confidant. He listened intently as I poured out my troubles and licked me profusely as a comfort. He always knew when I was worried or sad. He was desolate when I went away to university. He was 13 years old and Mum would always include his moods in her letters. ‘Taffy miserable — looking forward to the end of term!’ I missed him terribly. It was when I came home at Christmas in my third year that there was no enthusiastic welcome from Taffy. He’d gone out through the back door the night before and hadn’t come home. Dad initially joked he’d probably found a girlfriend, but I knew instinctively he hadn’t gone out temporarily. There was an air of finality about his disappearance. I spent the entire Christmas fruitlessly hunting around the area, sorrowfully weeping at the thought that he may have been hit by a car or locked into someone’s shed and could be cold, hungry or in pain. At the end of the holiday I had to return to my studies and never knew what happened. Dad said he’d probably gone off to die quietly in a ditch because he was old and didn’t want to upset me by dying in front of me or having to go to the vet for a lethal injection. I was inconsolable and for years felt the absence of the dog I’d loved so much whose end remains a mystery. I remember my grief as if it were yesterday. It was 44 years ago. It was two or three years before I plucked up the courage to have another dog. A friend of my first husband, Brian Murray, had a yellow Labrador which had pups. They were irresistible. We took one and called him Chivas after Brian’s favourite tipple — the whisky, Chivas Regal. He was a similar colour. There’s no doubt in those early years of marriage he was something of a child substitute. Road workers are no longer obliged to check the collar or microchip of a dog that has been run over – and bodies can be disposed of without worried families being informed . We played with him and walked him in every spare moment. He was loyal and, like Taffy, always an unconditionally welcoming presence when we returned home. We were careful never to let him out on his own, but one day, I popped out to the garden to pick some flowers, let my concentration slip for just a second and he was gone. I chased after him, calling his name, but he ignored me and was much faster than I was. He was heading for the main road. By the time we had organised to get in the car and hunt for him there was a knock on the door and a shocked, white-faced man explained his car had hit our dog. He said that he’d found our address on his collar and was sorry but thought Chivas was dead. We hardly knew what to do. We picked up his blanket, drove to where the man had told us he’d left him and found his lifeless body at the side of the road. There wasn’t a mark on him, but it was obvious the impact had killed him outright. We called the vet who simply told us to take him to the rubbish tip. I cradled him as my husband drove and when we arrived at the tip we met the same callous attitude demonstrated by the vet. ‘Oh, just dump it over there’ said one of the workmen. ‘We’ll incinerate it later’. It was a terribly thoughtless way to deal with two young people whose grief was palpable and we both wept all the way home. There have been other dogs since. In fact, I’ve never been without them. Now my beloved babies — yes, I openly admit they’re child substitutes now my children are grown up — are the chihuahuas Butch, Frida and Madge and I learned a hard lesson with Taffy and Chivas. My three are micro-chipped, never allowed out alone — except into my completely dog-proofed garden — and never permitted to run free on a walk except in the wilds of the countryside far from any roads. And so, I support the call for Harvey’s Law. Losing Chivas was heartbreaking, but we were grateful to the driver who’d taken the trouble to set our minds at rest. It’s true that it’s better to know the worst than to spend a lifetime wondering — and, surely, a civilised country can spare the small sum of money needed to make that possible.","Rule change means roadworkers are not obliged to check dog's identity .

"Google has sent its Glass smart eyewear back to the drawing board, while Apple is adament that the wrist is the right place for a wearable computer - but it appears Sony didn't get the message. The firm today released it's take on Google Glass - a set of thick, black glasses complete with a black control cable. The developer version is available for $840  - far less than the $1500 Google charged for its ill fated Google Glass Explorer edition. Scroll down for video . The glasses are larger and bulkier than Google's Glass explorer edition. Last month Google announced it was killing off the current version of its Glass headset. It didn't abandon the project entirely though, and promised to develop a range of smart glasses under a different guise. Now, sources claim Glass' new boss Tony Fadell wants to redesign the headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until 'it's perfect'. Sony says they uses 'holographic wavelength technology', to superimpose information onto the wearer's field of view—'without any half mirrors that may obstruct the user's vision,' the company boasted. It also comes with a built-in 3-megapixel CMOS image sensor, accelerometer, gyro, electronic compass, and brightness sensor, behind the 3-millimeter lenses. 'Imagine true augmented reality,' Sony boasts. 'Imagine a world of knowledge in front of your eyes. Imagine never not knowing, always having your hands free. Imagine SmartEyeglass.' The SED-E1 transparent-lens headset will go on sale in eight more countries—Japan, the U.S., France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden—next month. Sony hopes app developers will create hundreds of apps for it. 'Developers can combine the SmartEyeglass sensors and camera with the powerful features of the smartphone to create unique hands-free use cases. 'Whether you’re watching a live game, concert, touring a new city or carrying out a job, SmartEyeglass helps you stay focussed and involved, whilst supporting and empowering you with extra data, help and information.' In an email to PCWorld, a Sony spokesperson said they chose to release the developer's version now because 'as a hands-free device, SmartEyeglass can be a promising product with many practical uses.' 'But since we recognize the need to explore applications at this stage, we're releasing this developer edition,' the spokesperson said. Developers can access the official version of the SmartEyeglass SDK today. A separate (but wired) circular controller that clips onto your jacket or shirt collar houses the battery, speaker, microphone, NFC, and touch sensor. A separate (but wired) circular controller that clips onto your jacket or shirt collar houses the battery, speaker, microphone, NFC, and touch sensor. Early application concepts include a step-by-step guide on how to assemble an engine, scrolling in front of the mechanic's eyes as they work. Sony also suggested an app to share player stats while watching a sports game, or to display sightseeing information while visiting a tourist attraction. Early developers will have access to a handful of SmartEyeglass apps—available in the Google Play store—which enable access to Twitter, Facebook, Gmail, RSS, calendar, and voice control. Sony hopes to release its SmartEyeglass headset to consumers sometime next year. Google dubbed the first set of several thousand Glass users . as 'Explorers.' But as the Explorers hit the streets, they drew . stares and jokes. Some people viewed the device, capable of . surreptitious video recording, as an obnoxious privacy . intrusion, deriding the once-proud Explorers as 'Glassholes.' 'It looks super nerdy,' said Shevetank Shah, a Washington, . DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a . drawer. 'I'm a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too . many.' Glass now sells on eBay for as little as half list price. Google told the BBC it will  focus on 'future versions of Glass'. The Explorer programme, gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (£990), and was launched in the United States in 2013, and the UK last summer. From next week, the search firm will stop taking orders for the product but it says it will continue to support companies that are using Glass. The firm had already been thought to be developing a new version with chips made by Intel to go on sale later this year. The Glass team is also expected to now  move out of the Google X division which engages in 'blue sky' research, and become a separate undertaking, under its current manager Ivy Ross. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, signs that consumers are giving up on Glass have been building.Some developers recently have felt unsupported by investorsand, at times, Google itself. She and the Glass team will report to Tony Fadell, the chief executive of the home automation business Nest, acquired by Google a year ago, the BBC says. He said the project had 'broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike' and he was excited to be working with the team 'to integrate those learnings into future products'. Google says it is committed to working on the future of the product, but gave no timescale for the launch of an improved product. 'It’s hard to believe that Glass started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop,' the Glass team said in a post on Google+. 'We kept on it, and when it started to come together, we began the Glass Explorer Program as a kind of “open beta” to hear what people had to say.' 'Glass was in its infancy, and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk. 'Well, we still have some work to do, but now we’re ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run.'","Sony developer version is available for $840 .

"A mother has blamed doctors for her two-year-old's son eating habits after he refuses to eat anything but biscuits and now weighs the same as a three-month-old baby. Anastasia Shields, 23, from Northway in Gloucester, says she has tried everything to get Harvey-Jay to eat, including sneaking high-fibre milkshakes into his hot chocolate. She has hit out at doctors after her son, who weighs just 15lbs - spent 10 days at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and medics failed to diagnose the problem and told her he may just be a fussy eater. Anastasia Shields (left) has blamed doctors for her two-year-old son's eating habits after he refuses to eat anything but biscuits. She says medics should do more to diagnose his condition rather than say he is 'fussy' Mrs Shields said: 'Something needs to be done before we end up putting him in a coffin. He weighs less than a three-month-old baby. It's just ridiculous.' 'Half of the doctors in hospital hadn't read all of his notes before they came to see us. The whole time we were in there, it felt like we were doing the same things as at home.' Mrs Shields and her husband Andrew claim to have tried everything to get him eating wholesome and nutritious food but he will only eat biscuits, including fig rolls and chocolate digestives. They are occasionally able to trick him into eating cookie cereal because he thinks he is eating mini biscuits. Harvey-Jay is two-years-old but weights only 15lbs, which is the same as a three-month-old baby . Mrs Shields said: 'He will just play with food in his mouth and that's it. I'm at the end of my tether. I don't know what to do. 'Maybe it's an oral phobia. He never really put things in his mouth when he was baby, which was very unusual. 'The doctors think it might be a behavioural problem but I don't believe that because he's been like this since he was born. 'In his first month alive he lost a whole pound, it took us months to get his weight back up to what it had been when he was born. 'The only variety he adds to the diet is that he some times has a mouthful of yoghurt or a nibble of a bacon flavour crisp. 'It's got to the point now where he just runs away crying from plates of food - people keep trying to force him to eat and it's making the situation worse.' The mother-of-two said she was disappointed that doctors have done little more than suggest her son is just a fussy eater. She added that Harvey-Jay's weight loss has led to his skin become stretchy, a pale complexion and he is now prone to becoming ill more easily. Harvey-Jay was not born prematurely and although he was a light baby, weighing 5lbs 1oz, he was not critically under-weight. The couple, who have a healthy five-year-old daughter called Lilly, are now considering the offer of sending him to a special pre-school in Cheltenham which may help him. A spokesman for Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, said: 'We are committed to providing high quality and safe care for our patients and we take complaints seriously. 'We are disappointed to hear that Mrs Shields was unhappy and would like to continue to work with her to look into her concerns through our Patient Advice and Liaison Team so we can answer any questions she may have about her son's care.' Former GP and patient advocate Dr Mike Smith said: ‘If this little boy is really only eating biscuits I can certainly understand his parents’ concern. Mrs Shields, who has a healthy five-year-old daughter, sneaks high-fibre milkshake into Harvey-Jay's hot chocolate . ‘Presumably being the weight he is, the hospital will have followed up his stay and will be following his progress closely - at his weight they would not just let him go home and leave it there. ‘And presumably, after a stay of 10 days in hospital if they can find no medical problems I should imagine a specialist paediatrician will be closely watching his progress over the coming months and years. ‘What he is currently eating is clearly not a satisfactory diet. He’s not getting everything he needs as he would if he were eating fruit and vegetables. ‘He’s not getting enough vitamin c, or micro-nutrients like anti-oxidants and that sort of thing. ‘I cannot believe that the hospital would not have assigned him a dietary nutritionist to work with his parents to advise them on how best to give him a balanced diet. ‘This boy’s parents need to work with a nutritionist and specialist paediatrician and follow their advice to ensure their child receives a balanced diet.’","Anastasia Shields says she has tried everything to get Harvey-Jay to eat .

"Scuba divers have uncovered the largest treasure trove ever discovered off Israel's Mediterranean coast - but won't get a penny. The group initially thought they had found a toy coin on the ocean floor before tests confirmed the gold pieces were treasure. Experts who eventually counted 2,000 pieces, dating back more than 1,000 years, described the discovery as 'priceless.' The coins are now property of the state with no finder's fee for the divers. Gold: Divers uncovered almost 2,000 gold coins in different denominations, circulated by the Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled much of the Middle East and North Africa from 909 to 1171 . Members of a diving club in the Roman-era port stumbled across the treasure, weighing nearly 20 pounds, by pure chance while on a dive. 'The largest treasure of gold coins discovered in Israel was found in recent weeks on the seabed in the ancient harbour in Caesarea,' said a statement by Israeli Antiquities Authority. 'At first they thought they had spotted a toy coin from a game and it was only after they understood the coin was the real thing that they collected several coins and quickly returned to the shore in order to inform the director of the dive club about their find'.

Kobi Sharvit, director of the marine archaeology unit at the Israel Antiquities Authority, said excavations would be carried out in the hope of shedding more light on the origin of the treasure. 'There is probably a shipwreck there of an official treasury boat which was on its way to the central government in Egypt with taxes that had been collected,' said Sharvit. 'Perhaps the treasure of coins was meant to pay the salaries of the Fatimid military garrison which was stationed in Caesarea and protected the city. Treasure: It is the largest treasure trove ever discovered off Israel's Mediterranean coast with the country's antiquities authority calling it 'priceless' 'Another theory is that the treasure was money belonging to a large merchant ship that traded with the coastal cities and the port on the Mediterranean Sea and sank there,' he said. The Israeli Antiquities Authority declined to put a cash value on the coins, which it said had been exposed as a result of winter storms.","Largest haul ever found off Israel's Mediterranean coast .

"One family got the surprise of a lifetime on Valentine's Day. Rodney Gist of Fullerton, California, took his son and daughter out for a ride in their kayak on Santa Barbara harbor when the group was joined by an adorable guest - a baby sea lion. And while the family was nervous at first to have the wild animal join them, the sea lion proved to be a delightful guest. A baby sea lion caught a ride with one family on Valentine's Day . Rodney Gist (above with daughters) had taken his kids out for a kayak ride when the pup hopped on board . The sea lion even nuzzled with Gist a bit before returning to the ocean . 'At first it felt like he was pushing the kayak. We felt him back there,' Gist told KTLA. 'Next thing you know, I could tell he had climbed aboard.' The pup, which the family decided to name Cecil, even spent some time nuzzling with Gist as he quietly sat at the back of the kayak. 'Maybe he just was tired of swimming. Maybe he was wanting to interact with people. Maybe he just wanted to snuggle,' said Lee Lee, Gist's daughter. Soon, the people around them began to take notice too, and while the sight of the pup on the kayak was exciting for them, it seems lt was too much for the baby, who soon returned back to the ocean. Lucky for the family, the moment was all caught on video.","Rodney Gist of Fullerton, California took his son and daughter out for a kayak ride on Valentine's Day .

"While blizzards, snow and freezing conditions batter parts of the East Coast, unseasonably warm temperatures across the rest of the country mean the U.S. is experiencing one of its warmest winters on record. Almost the entirety of the country's West has experienced significantly warmer than average temperatures across December and January, while parts of the East Coast, including New York and Boston  are continuing to be battered by a freezing storm system. In this month alone thousands of warm weather records have been broken as high temperatures across the western states contributes to what is now the country's sixth-warmest winter on record. The West is experiencing temperatures which have contributed to the country's sixth-warmest winter on record. Pictured is Lake Success, near East Porterville, California, where drought conditions are worsening .

An Air Force officer walks through the snow after  Obama departed Air Force One in a motorcade following his trip to California at the weekend . The East Coast storm system - which follows a weekend storm that dumped a staggering 16.5 inches of snow on Boston  - is set to hit the South . So far this month there have been 4,074 records set for warm temperatures across the West, USA Today reported. This includes hot weather records in Seattle, San Jose, Las Vegas, Reno and Salt Lake City. Remarkably, the average February temperature in Salt Lake City is 16.4degrees above average, while Boise is up 12.2degrees and Phoenix 8degrees. Last month, the West, Rocky Mountains and Northern and Central Plains were all warmer than average, with many maintaining hot temperatures that placed the month among their top ten warmest averages. Incredibly, San Francisco had no measurable rainfall during January, while the state of California itself had its fourth-driest ever January. As well as remaining unseasonably warm, much of the West continues to suffer drought conditions. Nearly all of Hawaii was drier than average, with drought expanding to 46.6per cent of the state, according to the National Climatic Data Center. And although the drought improved in parts of the Southern Plains and Southwest, it worsened in the West and Midwest. A dog walks across the receding shoreline of Folsom Lake, California, in November, where the drought shows no sign of letting up .

The dry area spans California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma and other parts of the region, directly affecting more than 64 million people. In contrast to the big dry in the West, Winter Storm Octavia - which follows a weekend storm that dumped 16.5 inches of snow on Boston over the weekend - is now set to pummel  the South. Residents in Boston have battled through 16.5 inches of snow while New Yorkers are preparing for another six inch-dumping. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Washington DC was bracing for between four to eight inches of snow, according to USA Today. Mayor Muriel Bowser told CNN's 'The Situation Room' that the weather was 'dangerous cold'. Federal government offices in the area will be closed on Tuesday.

"A woman who lost her leg after the Boston Marathon bombing has begun training to run the event this year, declaring that it’s ‘my way of showing everyone that they didn’t destroy me’. Rebekah DiMartino, 27, had her left limb amputated in November after 17 operations and 19 months of physio failed to get her back on her feet. In December the mother-of-one from Katy, Texas, shared a video on Facebook of her first steps – and now she’s spending two-and-a-half hours in the gym every day and an hour in rehab in preparation for the April marathon. Scroll down for video . Rebekah DiMartino, 27, had her left limb amputated in November after 17 operations and 19 months of physio failed to get her back on her feet. She was severely injured in the Boston Marathon bombings . The mother-of-one from Katy, Texas, is spending two and a half hours in the gym every day and an hour in rehab in preparation for the April Boston Marathon . DiMartino said that taking part in the Boston Marathon was 'my way of showing everyone that they didn't destroy me, and I've come back stronger because of it' She told Espn: ‘I've never been a runner. I actually tried to run a half marathon a few years ago before this and I hated every minute of it. I didn't understand why people would run, especially for fun. But the marathon is a huge part of my life now, and it will always be. ‘I got blown up and they tried to destroy me. This is my way of showing everyone that they didn't destroy me, and I've come back stronger because of it.’ Ms DiMartino was with her son Noah, now seven, and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring 270. All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg. She had undergone 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, and suffered a serious bone infection. Struggle: DiMartino pictured with now-husband Pete at a Red Sox game months after the incident . Family: Ms DiMartino, Noah and Pete are looking forward to a 2015 of progress and milestones . Although she had been confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time since the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year. Still, even a boot has not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'. 'The day that I made the decision to chop it off is the best thing I have ever done for myself, because I was letting go of what was holding me back,' she told KHOU in December. 'You don't realize how many little blessings are in your life that you don't really even pay attention to because they're just expected.' Sharing the video of her first steps on Facebook, Ms DiMartino wrote: 'So look what I did today... Happy New Year!!! 2014 has GOT TO GO!!!!!' Her mother embroidered a special pink and black prosthetic leg that reads 'blessed', ready for April's marathon. And her son Noah said he is 'just excited that she gets to run races with me and play with me now'. Ms DiMartino added that she will not be paying any attention to the  trial of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as she works to rebuild her life. 'It doesn't matter what happens, it's not my judgment to make and it also doesn't change anything that's happened to me.'

"Double the loss: Mother-of-two Beverly Smith, 32, and her unborn baby girl were killed Saturday in a multi-vehicle car crash in Ohio . Just two weeks shy of her due date, a 32-year-old mother and her unborn baby girl were killed in a Valentine's Day car crash. Beverly Smith and her husband Eric, 33,  were driving home to Middleville, Michigan from a medical trip to New Jersey when they encountered whiteout conditions on I-90 Saturday morning near Sandusky, Ohio. The religious mother-of-two was sitting in the passenger's seat, reading a bible, when their Ford F-150 became entangled in a massive multi-vehicle car wreck involving  at least eight vehicles - including six semi-trucks. One of the tractor-trailer's jack-knifed and collided with the Smith's truck, which became pinned underneath the freight hauler. It took two and a half hours for emergency responders to cut Mrs Smith out of the passenger seat, and rush her to the hospital where she was tragically pronounced dead along with her unborn baby. Her husband Eric was also hospitalized, but none of his injuries are life-threatening. He was able to hold their stillborn daughter, which they planned to name Grace, briefly, according to his aunt Kathy Van Faasen who spoke on his behalf with MLive on Monday. 'People need to know that we're more than just that crash, that God has a plan for me and God had a plan for Bev,' Eric said, according to Van Fassen. 'There's still hope in the middle of tragedy.' The Smith's two other children, 3-year-old daughter Claire and 1-year-old son Sam, remain in the care of family members who were taking care of them while their parents were on a trip last week. Scroll down for video . A family torn apart: Mrs Smith and her husband Eric were travelling back to their home in Michigan from a medical trip to New Jersey when they became involved in the crash. Their two children, 3-year-old Claire (right) and 1-year-old Sam (left), were being cared for by family at the time . Since November, Mrs Smith's vision had been weakened by an eye disease called Retinitis pigmentosa. She and her husband traveled to New Jersey last week to receive acupuncture treatment for the condition, which did end up improving Mrs Smith's vision. Mr Smith's aunt says he is finding comfort in his faith that God was with his wife during her final moments. He was able to retrieve the bible she was reading at the time of the crash, which had a bookmark on the page she was reading. He plans to give it to his  daughter when she is older. Friends and family remember Mrs Smith as an avid runner, who would often participate in half marathons and other races. She and her husband liked taking their family on camping trips and boating on Lake Michigan. Stuck: Mrs Smith was just two weeks shy of her due date. The Smiths Ford F-150 became stuck underneath a semi-truck for two and a half hours after it jack-knifed. A picture of the scene above . Dangerous: At least eight vehicles were involved in the accident, which happened in heavy snow and strong winds . 'She was a steady presence, a kind, kind woman,' Van Faasen said. 'Bev was just pure goodness. She never judged, she was always smiling.' The Ohio State Police say conditions on the road were dangerous when the accident happened, with heavy snow and limited visibility due to the strong winds pushing over open fields on either side of the road. Six other people received minor injuries in the crash, but refused medical treatment. The accident is under investigation.","Beverly and Eric Smith were driving home to Michigan from a medical trip to New Jersey on Saturday when their pick-up truck was involved in a crash .

"The New Zealand bar manager who was arrested in December in Myanmar for insulting the Buddhist religion after publishing a psychedelic image of Buddha wearing headphones to promote his bar in Yangon is still no nearer being freed. Philip Blackwood was led back to jail by police after another court hearing in Yangon on Tuesday. Last December a Myanmar court denied the bar manager bail. The New Zealander has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was charged in December, along two local men, over the publication of a poster promoting cheap drinks at his bar. If found guilty, they face up to four years in jail. Phil Blackwood, a bar manager from New Zealand, is escorted by a police from the court after a hearing in Yangon on Tuesday . Blackwood told the court on December 26 that he had removed the image from the bar’s Facebook page, and posted an apology once he realised that it was being shared widely online, provoking outrage. 'I believe the law says the act must be deliberate, require malice with intent to offend,' Blackwood said. 'I have said a number of times, there was no intent.' Blackwood’s lawyer, Mya Thway, said he had received anonymous messages on Facebook threatening to cut him to pieces and burn him because he’d taken on the case. The Dominion Post in New Zealand reported that in a recent post on Facebook, his mother, Angela Blackwood, said they had received a moving letter from her son, who was being supported by the International Red Cross while in jail. Mr Blackwood manages a smile despite being taken back to prison after the hearing on Tuesday . 'He says he is trying to stay strong and hoping to be home for the Rugby World Cup (in September).' The 32-year-old New Zealander was arrested by Myanmar police in early December, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up. 'They were trying to promote the bar. Buddha grabs people's interest... however, Buddhists cannot accept it,' a police official told reporters. The trio were charged for breaching the country's Religion Act. New Zealander Philip Blackwood, centre, is escorted by Myanmar police officers following his first court appearance in Yangon, Myanmar, in December . According to the Act, anyone who attempts to insult, destroy or damage any religion can be punished by a maximum of two years in jail, with another two-year penalty for those who try to insult religion through the written word. Around 30 monks and 20 ordinary citizens gathered at the court in December when the three men were first charged. 'The whole public was insulted by the posting of the improper Buddha photograph,' a monk called Thusita from the Burmese Patriot Monks Union told reporters at the time. 'We will wait and see what action the authorities take. We will do what we need to, if the authorities do not take action,' he added. A Buddhist monk tries to take a photo of the New Zealander as he gets into a police vehicle outside the court in  Yangon, Myanmar, during his first court appearance in December . VGastro Bar employee Htut Ko Ko Lwin is escorted to a police vehicle after appearing in court in Yangon in December . The offending image was quickly removed from the bar's Facebook page and replaced by an apology from VGastro Management expressing 'sincere regret' for having offended 'the citizens of this wonderful city.' 'Our ignorance is embarrassing for us,' read the statement. But the apology attracted a slew of angry comments from Burmese social media users including one which decried the bar management as 'utterly unprofessional and culturally insensitive.' V Gastro bar, which opened in December, swiftly deleted the insulting image and posted this apology on its Facebook page . The arrests come as Myanmar grapples with a growing Buddhist nationalist movement, spearheaded by extremist monks who have urged boycotts of Muslim shops and proposed a raft of laws to restrict religious freedoms. Their rise has accompanied several bouts of religious violence between Muslims and Buddhists. The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country .","Phil Blackwood was lead back to jail by police after another court hearing .

"A revealing insight into Andy Murray's tactical and mental approach has emerged after his motivational notes from the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam last week were leaked.

Murray, who lost to Novak Djokovic in the final of the Australian Open earlier this month, was pictured looking at the notes in his courtside chair. Instructions included 'Try your best', 'Be proactive during points'. 'Try to be the one dictating' and 'Be intense with your legs'. It is unclear who was responsible for the instructions as coach Amelie Mauresmo did not accompany him to the ATP World Tour 500 tournament in the Netherlands, though Murray did reveal last month that he has been working with a sports psychologist.

"'Scaremongering': Ed Miliband has been accused of misleading voters with 'NHS letter' Ed Miliband has been accused of misleading voters after Labour sent out letters made to look like they were from a hospital or GP surgery. Many were left upset by the mail, which could easily be mistaken for test results or notification of changes in local NHS provision. The letters come in envelopes saying that they contain important information about the NHS. It is only when people read the contents that they realise it is a message from the Labour leader. Mr Miliband has been condemned as ‘cruel’ and ‘insensitive’ after sending the letters to people including hospital patients, the elderly and families of the recently deceased. Opponents have accused him of scare tactics and claim it is further evidence of his campaign to ‘weaponise’ the NHS ahead of the general election. Across the top of the envelope is the message: ‘Important information about the future of local NHS services.’ The only clue as to its real contents is small print on the reverse that says it should be returned to ‘Labour Central’ at an address in Newcastle if undelivered. In the letter, Mr Miliband writes about the ‘challenges facing your local hospital’ and warns that ‘services here are struggling’. Despite the claim that it concerns the future of ‘local NHS services’, exactly the same message is being sent to homes across the country. One was addressed to a woman in Southampton who died from cancer six months ago, aged 72. Her husband, 76, had asked for her name to be taken off the electoral roll – which is commonly used by political parties and companies for mailshots – so he assumed it was from the hospital that treated her. The man, a lifelong Labour voter and former docker, was left in tears when he realised his mistake. His daughter Kerry Haynes, 51, branded Mr Miliband ‘cruel’ for the ‘deliberate deception’ and added: ‘I go round every day, and when I arrived Dad was crying. 'The poor man had to read the letter four or five times to work out that all it was asking for was his vote. 'If he’d thought it was junk mail he would not have opened it, but as it was addressed to my mum and made to look like it was from the hospital he was really upset.’ Misleading: Across the top of the envelope is the message: ‘Important information about the future of local NHS services,' and recipients only find out the letter's true message once they have opened it . Another the recipients was Sylvia Knight, 39, from Cambridge, who mistook the letter for information about a hospital appointment she is waiting for. Her partner Sarah Brown said: ‘Sylvia is an outpatient with the local health service. The letter came and it looked like it was something official from the hospital. She did not realise it was something political until she opened it. ‘It’s a bit freaky. They don’t know who they are sending these letters to and what these people are going through. If someone was having treatment for cancer, it could be quite unnerving.’ Another recipient, in Middlesex, said: ‘I’m sure there will be people desperate for test results or appointments who will be opening the letter thinking they’ve got the information they’ve been waiting for.’ Tory MP Robert Jenrick, who is on the Commons health select committee, said: ‘Ed Miliband has said he wants to weaponise the NHS and now we can see how far Labour will sink in their attempt to spread fear. ‘Desperate moves like this show what little regard Labour have for the public and why Ed Miliband isn’t up to the job of being Prime Minister.’ Mary Macleod, Tory MP for Brentford and Isleworth, said the Labour leader was ‘scaremongering’. She added: ‘I was shocked to see my constituents receiving this misleading political rubbish from Ed Miliband. Not only can the letter be mistaken for important information from the NHS but inside is just a missive of pure inaccuracy.’ Mr Miliband’s spokesman said: ‘The letter makes clear it’s from the Labour Party. The future of our NHS is incredibly important.'","Labour Party letters say they contain important information about NHS .

"A 21-year-old man in Montgomery County, Texas was arrested on Saturday after tying a donkey to his Toyota pick-up truck and towing the animal several miles. Authorities say suspect Nasim Irsan didn't even think anything was wrong with dragging the aging donkey at least three miles  Saturday afternoon. They stopped him near the 18000 block of Old Houston Road where the animal was handed over to animal control and Irsan was arrested on animal cruelty charges. Painful: A man in Montgomery County, Texas was arrested this weekend for tying a donkey to his pick-up truck and dragging the animal several miles . Charged: Driver Nasim Irsan, 21 (left), has since been charged with cruelty to an animal after police spotted him towing the donkey . 'He didn't think he was doing anything wrong – that he was moving it from one place to another,' Precinct 5 deputy livestock constable Marshall Williams said. Williams says Irsan had tied the donkey to his truck with a single rope connected around the animal's neck and at the hitch. Luckily the donkey appeared to be in 'fine condition' when Irsan was stopped. Witness Hazik Hassan saw the donkey after Irsan was stopped by police and told KTRK that the scene was 'pretty terrible'. 'That was a long way for a horse, and it was an older horse, mule I mean. You could see its ribs and everything, that's pretty sad man,' Hassan said.

"The first mysterious camera-mounted car was spotted in California last week, and now new sightings of Apple's minivans have been posted online. At least two videos - one recorded in California, another filmed in Florida - suggest the top-secret project is more widespread than first thought. And rumours range from a Street View-style mapping service to an electric car that will rival Tesla or a self-driving van to rival Google. Scroll down for videos . After the first mysterious camera-mounted car was spotted in California last week, further sightings of Apple's minivans have been posted online. At least two videos - one recorded in California, another filmed in Florida (pictured) - suggest the top-secret project is more widespread than first thought . The Californian footage was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto. The Florida recording was filmed on a highway in Coral Springs and uploaded by Apple Insider. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside. The passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view, while the driver points to the camera and drives off. Claims that Apple is building a car may seem like a leap, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. 'I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Other reports have spotted the vans in Hawaii and Wisconsin. The latest vans haven't officially been confirmed as belonging to Apple, but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are. The far-reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims Apple is developing a mapping service. With 12 cameras on top of the car, however, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View. Plus, reports recently claimed Apple has several hundred employees developing an electric car at a secret lab. This project has been dubbed 'Titan'. This Apple research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away -  and is being overseen by Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive. Apple could, of course, be using the vans for both projects. The Wall Street Journal added that hundreds of employees are working on the Titan project and boss Tim Cook approved the project close to a year ago. The Florida recording (pictured) was filmed in Coral Springs. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside and the passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view . The Californian footage (pictured) was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto . These reports followed rumours that Apple was developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The claims were made in an email from an unnamed Apple employee. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011, Steve Jobs had considered building a car. A unnamed Apple employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.'  It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California . In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range (the Tesla P85D is pictured) or the email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software . The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson said the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Alternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software. The original Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco. The blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple. Last year, footage emerged of a self-driving Dodge Caravan that looked like the current Apple minivans. When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was. With 12 cameras on top of the mysterious Apple car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View (pictured left). Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has refined the technology ever since (Street View screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London pictured right) Alternatively, the vehicles spotted in California and Florida could be self-driving cars. The cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software, for example. If Apple was developing such systems, they would would rival Google's self-driving cars (pictured)","At least two videos, in California and Florida, have been posted online .
This suggests the top-secret project is more widespread than first thought .
Rumours range from a Street View-style  service to a Tesla-style electric car .
In the Florida video, the passenger is seen concealing an iPad .
The far-reaching nature of the project adds  weight to mapping rumours .

"Fire officials said Darryl Ferguson (pictured during previous arrest), 55, confessed to causing a blaze at an Islamic institute in Houston . A homeless man has been arrested and charged with arson for a fire that destroyed a building at an Islamic institute in Houston, fire officials said on Monday. The blaze early on Friday at the Quba Islamic Institute destroyed one of three buildings there, but no one was injured. Fire officials said Darryl Ferguson, 55, confessed to causing the blaze – but he claimed it was an accident as he was led away by officials, according to a Houston news website. Ferguson had been staying in the area and was considered a suspect by investigators. They were looking for him on Monday when he apparently approached them on his bicycle. Ruben Hernandez, from the Houston Fire Department’s arson squad, told Chron.com: ‘We asked if he wanted to talk to us in our office. Mr Ferguson made an admission.’ Ferguson has been linked to a number of crimes in the past, including credit card abuse, trespassing, possession of a controlled substance, prostitution and assault. Authorities said that someone used an accelerant in the 5am Friday blaze, according to one of the imam's sons, 25-year-old Ahsan Zahid. Mr Zahid said that an investigator told him that the incident was a suspected arson, and that the fire was not an accident. On Friday, the Houston Fire Department (HFD) said in a release it was investigating and could not yet name the cause of the fire. Earlier Twitter users had directed their fury at a Texas man who allegedly said on social media that the center should burn down. According to The Daily Kos Herron wrote on social media ‘let it burn… block the fire hydrant’. The Daily Kos reported that Herron is a Crystal Beach Volunteer Fire Department (CBVFD) volunteer. Scroll down for video . Charged: Mr Ferguson is pictured here being led away by officials investigating the blaze in Houston . The fire, which completely destroyed the contents of a storage shed, is thought to have been arson. Pictured is Ahsan Zahid, an assistant imam at the center, at the scene of the devastation . Aftermath: The fire completely destroyed the contents of a storage shed at the Quba Islamic Institute . Texas has the US's eighth-largest population of Muslims, according to the Texas State Historical Association . A LinkedIn profile lists a man of the same name as working for the fire department and Herron's own Facebook profile features him in front of a fire truck dressed in overalls. However, CBVFD said in a statement sent to Daily Mail Online early Monday that Herron is not affiliated with the organization whatsoever. The statement said 'There have been recent post on social media from someone stating they are a member of our Fire Department and have posted hate messages against the Islamic Community. 'Please know that this person, Dustin Herron, is not a member of the Crystal Beach Volunteer Fire Dept; nor has he ever been a member of our fire department. 'We are in the process of trying to track down Mr. Herron regarding the comments he made. We have also notified the Galveston County Sheriff Dept. regarding Mr Herron falsely stating he is a fire fighter within our organization. Online activity: Dustin Herron, pictured, allegedly wrote online 'Let it burn...block the fire hydrant' regarding the Quba Islamic Institute fire . Uproar: Herron allegedly posted this message on social media. Daily Mail Online could not independently confirm the authenticity of the post . 'We have received many e-mails regarding his recent social media post and comments. 'Please know that our Volunteer's give 100% effort 100% of the time.' One tweet against Herron asked him 'why the hate? Serve and protect? Or just hate?' Another said 'you are an embarrassment to all public safety officials and volunteers, what you posted about the Islamic center is shameful!' Both Herron and a spokesman for the Galveston County Sheriff's Office (GCSO) did not immediately return requests for comment early Monday from Daily Mail Online. The FBI said Saturday that they are monitoring the situation and could take a more active role in the investigation, according to Reuters. The Council on American Islamic Relations's Texas office has called for possible hate crime motivations to be looked at in the investigation. Federal agencies are expected to become more involved if that is the case. No injuries were reported in the fire, which largely took place in a storage building and is thought to have caused $100,000 in damage. The contents of the building, which housed the institute's computers, lights and equipment for a renovation, were completely destroyed. Authorities said the blaze started at 5am and caused an expected $100,000 worth of damage before firefighters were able to put it out, according to one of the imam's sons, 25-year-old Ahsan Zahid . The Houston Fire Department is still investigating the cause of the fire, though they reportedly told Mr Zahid that it did not start by accident . The center has a place to pray, holds community events, offers Arabic classes and also runs a Sunday School. The Quba Islamic Institute is asking for donations through their website qubahouston.org, and Zahid told Daily Mail Online that they had raised $2,500 as of Saturday afternoon. The institute said a man had driven past the institute and mockingly yelled 'Allah' on Thursday. A man with a covered face was chased away from the building earlier in the week. The Muslim center had been scheduled to host a talk by a former Guantanamo Bay guard who converted to Islam after the experience, Terry Holdbrooks, on Friday night. Zahid said that the event took place despite the fire and that 'all programs, activities, and prayers have, and will continue as scheduled'. The Islamic Institute used its Facebook page to reach out for donations and ask for tolerance in the wake of the fire, but their posts soon saw an influx of anti-Muslim commenters . Two suspicious incidents happened in the week leading up to the fire, including a man with a covered face who had to be chased away from the building . The center's Facebook account responded to abuse on Facebook by thanking offensive users for their perspective . The institute's Facebook page has also come under attack from posters who have insulted Islam repeatedly on posts where the center is explaining what happened in the fire. The institute has defended itself against the Islamophobic posts by thanking the users for their perspective and urging tolerance. The possible hate crime follows on the death of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that federal investigators are looking into for motives of religious hatred. Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were buried Thursday. Texas has the US's eighth-largest population of Muslims, according to the Texas State Historical Association . The annual Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin was targeted by anti-Islam protesters last month, the Los Angeles Times reported. In 2011 the Houston Fire Department said that someone had deliberately set fire to a mosque on the other side of the city. The Quba Islamic Institute is a gathering place for prayer and community events, but also holds Arabic and Sunday School classes .","Fire destroyed a building at the Quba Islamic Institute in Houston on Friday .

"It seemed a friendly stranger was simply coming over to peer into a pram and admire a fellow shopper’s little boy. But the woman who approached this mother in a Boots store had a far more sinister intention. The stranger grabbed hold of the one-year-old and throttled him, telling his mother: ‘That baby would rather be dead.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attack: Police are hunting for the woman in the striped poncho who throttled a stranger's one-year-old baby boy who was saved from further injury by her mother . Threat: The suspect was confronted by the mother and security and said 'that baby would rather be dead' Police are now hunting for the woman believed to be in her sixties, who assaulted the child in a Boots store on The Strand in central London. CCTV footage of the incident on January 16 shows how the baby was attacked so forcefully that the pushchair started moving across the shop floor. Scotland Yard said the boy was only saved from serious injury by the fast response of his mother, who grabbed the woman’s hand and pulled her away. Detectives believe the mother and her son were followed into the store, close to Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross railway station, at around 12.30pm. The suspect walked the length of the shop towards them and then reached into the pram, taking hold of the baby’s throat. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘The mother of the baby had originally thought that the suspect was going to just look and fuss over her baby. Planned: Detective believe that the woman had followed the mother and baby into the central London Boots before choking the child . Description: The suspect is described as a white woman in her early sixties, 5ft 2ins tall, of chubby build, with light coloured hair and a boil or eye deformity on her face . ‘But when she saw what was actually happening, she immediately grabbed the suspect’s hand to prevent the assault from continuing. ‘The baby was not injured due to his mother’s quick reaction. However, she was extremely shaken up and traumatised by the incident.’ A security guard then intervened and the attacker said, ‘That baby would rather be dead’ as she was escorted out of the store. She is said to have walked off towards Trafalgar Square. Police followed her on CCTV but lost track of her in the crowds. The suspect is described as white, in her early sixties, 5ft 2in tall, of a chubby build, with light- coloured hair and a boil or eye deformity. She wore a deer stalker hat and a distinctive white, red and grey striped poncho top with a brown handbag and black boots. Anyone who witnessed the incident, was in the area at the time or has information that could assist officers is asked to call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Detectives believe woman followed mother and baby in to Boots on Strand .

"Mark Faulkner (pictured) acted as a pallbearer at the funeral of a 14-year-old boy - then stole money from the youngster's memorial fund . A conman who acted as a pallbearer at the funeral of a 14-year-old boy has been convicted of stealing money from the youngster's memorial fund. Mark Faulkner took more than £1,200 from a fund dedicated to the life of Lewis Edge who died in a fall from the Runcorn/Widnes Silver Jubilee bridge in Cheshire in July 2012. The 26-year-old befriended Lewis's grieving family and offered them guidance in how to raise cash - and even set up a bank account and a board of trustees, Warrington Crown Court heard. A number of small charity events were staged in the family's home town of Widnes, Cheshire, with Faulkner entrusted with banking the proceeds. Lewis's mother Lisa Millward became suspicious when a bank statement revealed that there were fewer funds in the account than were expected. She contacted Faulkner, a former ice cream man, on a number of occasions and asked for the return of the fund's bank book but he gave her a string of excuses to avoid its return. Concerns were raised with Cheshire Police who attended Faulkner's home in November 2012 and asked to see the bank book. This was subsequently seized and Faulkner was arrested. Further examination of the bank book showed that two deposits that Faulkner was due to make were never stamped in the book, said Cheshire Police. CCTV was also seized from the bank and hours of footage were examined which showed that Faulkner did not enter the bank between the dates given. During his interview Faulkner denied the theft of the money and maintained he had taken the money in good faith and had transported it to the bank and paid it in. Faulkner, of Warrington, Cheshire was today convicted by a jury of the theft of £655 from the fund between October 18 2012 and November 10 2012, and a separate theft of £590 from the fund between October 21 2012 and November 10 2012. He showed no emotion as the unanimous guilty verdict was delivered. Faulkner, who carried the coffin at Lewis’ funeral and was in the Boy’s Brigade with the youngster, was the trustee of the Lewis Edge Brightest Star Memorial Fund along with Lewis’ father Graeme and mother Lisa  as well as her father Brian Millward. In his closing statement, John Marsh, defending, said: 'Mr Faulkner devoted a great deal of his time and expertise to help raise funds. 'Mr Faulkner put in hours of work raising funds himself and not once did he ask for any repayment for his work. Mark Faulkner took more than £1,200 from a fund dedicated to the life of Lewis Edge (pictured) who jumped from the Runcorn/Widnes Silver Jubilee bridge in July 2012 . 'He is a man who has found his world crashing down around him.' But after the hearing, Lewis's parents said Faulkner had 'twisted the knife' by dragging them through the courts. Lewis's mother Lisa said she had been unable to work because of severe depression throughout the 18 month ordeal. She said: 'I feel like he has twisted the knife by dragging us through the courts. We have not been able to grieve for our son. 'Mark was brilliant after Lewis died. He had so many great ideas and said he'd done it before. 'He even came around to speak to us for long periods. He even used to drive the bus to take our 12-year-old son Josh to rugby. 'But he just doesn't seem bothered with what he's done. 'And he has caused my whole life to fall to pieces. My job, my family, my relationship, it's all fallen to pieces thanks to him.' Warrington Crown Court (pictured) heard how Faulkner befriended Lewis's grieving family and offered them guidance in how to raise cash - and even set up a bank account and a board of trustees . Lewis's father Graeme Edge added: 'I hope he gets a custodial sentence. 'He's not just stolen from us, he's stolen from the local community who put money they didn't have into that fund. 'I'd like to thank them for their support through this whole thing.' Helen Graves, Senior Crown Prosecutor with Mersey-Cheshire Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'Faulkner is a callous thief who targeted a family when they were at their lowest ebb. 'He stole money that had been given by people who had been moved by the tragic suicide of 14 year old Lewis Edge. 'It was to be used to help other teenagers avoid such a fate but Faulkner stole it, then proceeded to try and cover his tracks with a series of lies. 'It had become clear that Faulkner hadn't deposited donations at the bank yet he continually denied this, causing hours of wasted police time as detectives studied CCTV from the bank to see if he was telling the truth.' Faulkner is due to be sentenced on Wednesday.","Mark Faulkner acted as pallbearer at the funeral of 14-year-old Lewis Edge .

Jackson Wray and Chris Wyles (two) crossed the line for Saracens while Charlie Hodgson added nine points from the boot. Saracens were able to call upon the services of England number eight Billy Vunipola after the powerful backrower was left out of Stuart Lancaster's squad for the clash with Samoa on Saturday night. Northampton, despite missing a host of stars away on international duty including Tom Wood, Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes and George North, were able to name a powerful starting line-up including England centre Luther Burrell and Samu Manoa at number eight. Burrell made his presence felt immediately when he burst onto Myler's perfectly timed pass and sent winger Wilson into the corner for a stunning opening try. Myler fired over the touchline conversion to cap off a dream start after just two minutes of play. Saints winger Jamie Elliott struggled to deal with Alex Goode's grubber kick and when Manoa pounced on the loose ball from an offside position, referee Matthew Carley awarded Sarries a penalty. Hodgson duly obliged to get his team on the board. Myler increased Northampton's lead when lock Alistair Hargreaves was penalised for not rolling away at ruck time. Saints were causing the Saracens pack all kinds of trouble around the fringes, with the backrow trio of Calum Clark, Dowson and Manoa proving a handful with ball in hand. Wilson got in for his second try in the 14th minute when the Kiwi raced onto Lee Dickson's perfectly judged kick to touch down in the same corner.

Myler's third penalty of the afternoon kept the Saints out of reach before Wyles crashed over after Saints prop Alex Waller had been sent to the sin bin. Wyles crossed again with 10 minutes remaining as the home side's second half resurgence continued. Myler kicked a penalty in the 76th minute to make the result safe before Hodgson landed a last-minute penalty to salvage a bonus point.","Northampton top the Aviva Premiership after 31-24 win at Saracens .

"Ukraine is accusing Russian-backed rebels of destroying their ceasefire agreement by seizing the town Vladimir Putin wanted them to capture. Pro-Moscow separatists claim to have captured 80 per cent of Debaltseve and to have taken at least 300 government soldiers prisoner as fierce fighting raged in the eastern Ukrainian town yesterday. Eyewitnesses said artillery rounds were hitting the town every five seconds and smoke rose skywards as unguided Grad rockets landed. Battle: A view of an explosion caused by shelling is seen not far from Debaltseve yesterday morning . Fire: Shelling was reported close to the town of Debaltseve, with rebels claiming to have captured the majority of the town, despite the Ukrainian government insisting it is still in control . ‘Eighty per cent of Debaltseve is already ours,’ said Eduard Basurin, a rebel leader. ‘A clean-up of the town is under way.’ He said negotiations were under way for 5,000 Ukrainian troops trapped in its bombed-out streets to surrender. ‘Hundreds’ had been captured and would eventually be released to their families, he added. Ukraine’s president Petro Poroshenko urged the world to stop the attacks. ‘I call on the permanent members of the UN Security Council to prevent further violation of fundamental principles and rules of the UN and the unleashing of a full-scale war in the very centre of Europe,’ he said in a statement. The Obama administration distanced itself from arming Ukraine. A State Department spokesman said: ‘Our belief here in the administration, and I would be surprised if others disagree, is that getting into a proxy war with Russia is not in the interest of Ukraine or the international community.’ Independent observers attempting to monitor the so-called ceasefire have been unable to enter the town due to the intensity of the fighting, although Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukraine would withdraw heavy weapons as soon as their forces stopped coming under attack. Fighting is raging near Debaltseve because both the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists are demanding the strategically important town falls on their side of the armistice line before they will lay down their weapons. Armed: Ukrainian artillery is seen outside Luhanske, a vilage some 14 miles north of Debaltseve . Ukrainian government troops and Russia-backed rebels face a deadline  to start pulling back heavy weapons from the front line in eastern Ukraine, although there is no sign of that happening so far. The ministry said street fighting continued in Debaltseve, which has been the epicenter of fighting in the past two weeks. It did not say how many soldiers had been seized in the ambush. The Ukrainian presidential office earlier  called on the European Union and NATO to condemn the Russia-backed rebels for violating the cease-fire brokered by European leaders last week. Russian news agencies quoted Valery Chaly, chief of the Ukrainian presidential administration, as saying that Kiev wants the EU and NATO to 'resolutely condemn' the separatists for violating the deals. Earlier Lysenko said the separatists continued to attack government positions overnight around Debaltseve and that the pullout hinged on the cease-fire being fully observed. He added that at least five troops were killed and nine injured in the past 24 hours in the war zone. The cease-fire deal, brokered by European leaders last week, specifies the pullout begin on the second day after the parties stop fighting. This condition has not been met, Lysenko said. 'As soon as the fire ceases ... we will be ready to begin the withdrawal,' he said. The war in eastern Ukraine has already killed more than 5,600 people and displaced more than a million, according to U.N. figures issued yesterday. It has also left the country's industrial heartland in ruins.

This condition has not been met, Ukraine military spokesman Lysenko said . Grief: A funeral is seen being held for a victim of the shelling in eastern Ukraine . Fighting has stopped or subsided in some parts of war-torn eastern Ukraine, however. Rebel mouthpiece the Donetsk News Agency quoted rebel officials this morning saying  they had not seen any violations of the cease-fire in their area since 8pm last night. Journalists today saw artillery rounds fired by Ukrainian troops at rebel bases around Debaltseve. Sustained shelling was also heard in the area, some coming from Grad rocket launchers. Debaltseve is a government-held town surrounded by rebel forces, and both sides claim it should be on their side of the cease-fire line. The issue was not resolved under a cease-fire agreement negotiated last week by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. Elsewhere, at least one rebel leader claimed his troops had begun to withdraw heavy weapons. 'I was at the front line last night, and our tanks, our artillery were pulling back,' Igor Plotnitsky, the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, northeast of Debaltseve, was quoted as saying by the Russian news agency Tass. He added that he 'expects the same from Ukraine.' Members of the Ukrainian armed forces ride on a military vehicle near Debaltseve .

Tribute: Pro-Russian rebels fire their weapons into the air during the funerals of four fighters on Monday . Carnage: The damaged remains of Donetsk airport are seen in eastern Ukraine  on Monday afternoon . Due to security issues, his claims could not be immediately verified. Lysenko said the Ukrainian troops 'have not noticed any such actions' on the ground. The separatists were expected to discuss the withdrawal of the weaponry later Tuesday with representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the group charged with monitoring the cease-fire, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. In a phone call late on Monday German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to use his influence on the separatists to ensure that they stop the fighting. Merkel's office reported that the three leaders agreed on 'concrete steps to enable an observation' of the situation in Debaltseve by the OSCE. It did not elaborate on what these steps would be. OSCE representatives could not get to Debaltseve on Monday because of the heavy fighting there.","Shelling was reported close to key transport hub Debaltseve yesterday .

"Iran's supreme leader has criticized the film 'American Sniper,' saying the movie about a U.S. soldier fighting in Iraq encourages violence against Muslims, a state-run newspaper has claimed . The comments by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  come amid renewed criticism of the West by the leader as his country negotiates with world powers over its contested nuclear program. The daily IRAN Farsi newspaper quoted Khamenei as saying he hadn't watched the film directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, but had heard about its plot from others. The film focuses on the life of U.S. Navy SEAL marksman Chris Kyle, who with 160 confirmed kills is considered the most lethal sniper in American military history. Anger: The comments by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (pictured) come amid renewed criticism of the West as his country negotiates with world powers over its contested nuclear program . Blockbuster hit: 'American Sniper' is a movie starring Bradley Cooper (pictured alongside Sienna Miller) and is based on Chris Kyle's memoir, which was released to critical acclaim . 'The movie 'Sniper' that is made by Hollywood encourages a Christian or non-Muslim youngster to harass and offend the Muslims as far as they could,' the newspaper quoted Khamenei as saying. Khamenei also reportedly discussed neo-Nazis attacking Muslims in Germany, saying Muslims have no safety in the West. 'You are seeing what sort of propaganda there are against Muslims in Europe and the U.S.,' he reportedly said. The newspaper said Khamenei made the comments while meeting representatives of Iranian religious minorities in the country's parliament three weeks ago. The newspaper did not explain why it was publishing the comments now. Hollywood movies are popular in Iran and Iranian state television channels often broadcast them. However, 'American Sniper' has not been released in Iran, where Khamenei has final say in all state matters. Story: American Sniper focuses on the life of U.S. Navy SEAL marksman Chris Kyle, who with 160 confirmed kills is considered the most lethal sniper in American military history. He was himself killed in 2013 in a shooting incident at the Rough Creek Ranch-Lodge-Resort shooting range in Erath County, Texas . 'American Sniper' has been a sensation at the box office, earning more than $300 million in North America since its release in December. It tells the story of Chris Kyle, who served four tours in the Iraq War and was awarded several commendations for acts of heroism and meritorious service in combat. He received two Silver Star Medals, five Bronze Star Medals, one Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals and numerous other unit and personal awards. On February 2, 2013, Kyle was shot and killed at a shooting range near along with friend Chad Littlefield. The man accused of killing them is awaiting trial for murder. The U.S. and Iran have viewed each other with mutual suspicion since the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution overthrew the American-back shah and the ensuing hostage crisis at the American embassy in Tehran. Iranian-backed militiamen and soldiers are battling the Islamic State group now in Iraq, but the country has not joined a U.S.-led coalition targeting the extremists in airstrikes.","Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says he had been told about the hit film's plot .

"An incentive to offer 'cash rebates' to schools that place lunch orders with McDonald's has been slammed by a parenting group who claim it's sending unhealthy messages to children. McDonald's sent letters to schools at Mildura in rural Victoria this month saying the fast food chain could deliver burgers, fries, nuggets and desserts to students. The letter, which was forwarded on to The Parents' Jury and the Obesity Policy Coalition by a parent, promises to give free drinks and a nine percent cash rebate if the whole school participates. McDonald's sent letters to schools at Mildura in rural Victoria this month saying the fast food chain could deliver burgers, fries, nuggets and desserts to students . The local McDonald's store suggested schools could use the lunch orders as a fundraiser, end of term treat or delivered to school functions. The letter includes an order form and notes that offers of food are also available for students receiving encouragement or achievement awards. Parents' Jury spokeswoman Dimity Gannon said she was horrified by the promotion. 'Allowing McDonald's to be promoted in schools normalizes the consumption of fast food, undermining both parents' and schools' efforts to teach children about nutrition and instil healthy eating habits,' she said. Ms Gannon, whose group represent 7,000 parents in Australia, said the promotion undermined healthy eating messages that schools were trying to get across. The letter, which included an order form for food, promised to give free drinks and a nine percent cash rebate if the whole school participates . Parents' Jury spokeswoman Dimity Gannon said she was horrified by the promotion as it undermined the healthy eating message schools were trying to get across . Obesity Police Coalition executive manager Jane Martin argued the attempts by McDonald's to promote 'unhealthy food' to children was insidious. 'This deliberate targeting of children in these settings shows that McDonald's is putting profit ahead of children's health. This is from a company that claims to be committed to responsible advertising to children,' she said. McDonald's told The Age the chain's restaurants were sometimes approached by schools to provide assistance for fundraisers. 'Provided the school has parental permission, we do not see an issue with them hosting a McDonald's lunch as a fundraiser or end of term treat,' a spokesman said. 'McDonald's does not engage in any communications in Australian schools unless requested by, or agreed with, the school administration.'

So who are the designers behind the wildly successful label, and how did they climb to the top? Michelle graduated from New York's Parsons School of Design and interned for Marc Jacobs, while Carly studied at the same school and interned for Donna Karen, Proenza Schouler and Oscar De La Renta. Cushnie Et Ochs was first notably worn by Reese Witherspoon at a Los Angeles film gala in November 2011, but made its first real splash the following month. After the First Lady Michelle Obama wore an elegant pine green dress by the designers to attend the 2011 Christmas in Washington event, fashion die-hards were drawn like moths to a flame.

Speaking to Three Bad Mice about their aesthetic around this time, Carly and Michelle cited 'the female body, strength and inner spirit' as their inspiration. 'The brand is for women by women, and we want to always express this female sensuality in our clothes,' they said. 'We often look to art and architecture to influence our sculptural shapes and lines.' Last year, Cushnie Et Ochs' statement gowns were worn by Kim Kardashian, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Selena Gomez and Lea Michelle, among others. At New York Fashion week in 2013, supermodel Karlie Kloss showcased an asymmetrical white dress on the Cushnie Et Ochs runway, and loved it so much she snapped it up and wore it to attend Betsey Johnson's show the following week.

And another thing, much to the dismay of animal lovers everywhere: fur. Asked by The Fashion Spot to name their favorite element of this season, Carly responded: 'Fur. Loads of it. I’ve got a giant fur scarf and my fur coat, I’m not ashamed.' 'Same,' echoed Michelle. 'I’ve got two coats and my fur wraparound.'

"A rare piece of presidential history is sitting in the Arizona desert - and its  new owners didn't know its significance for years. The first-ever Air Force One, used by Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, had been sold to a crop duster who used it for parts. It now sits in a field at the Marana Regional Airfield outside Tuscon, where the owners parked it. The plane  inspired the call sign Air Force One after nearly running into another aircraft over the skies of New York City in 1953. Scroll down for video . Columbine II, a plane used by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 and 1954, is now sitting in an Arizona field . The interior of the plane used to contain marble floors and a mahogany desk but now needs $200,000 in restoration . The plane is now being degraded by the Arizona sun, and its owners want to sell it for $1.5million to someone who will restore it . The plane, a Lockheed Constellation dubbed Columbine II in honor of Marie Eisenhower's home state Colorado, was used by the 34th president in 1953 and 1954. It included the mahogany desk where Eisenhower wrote his Atoms For Peace speech that he gave to the UN General Assembly in 1953, in which he discussed nuclear warfare, according to Fox. Then president-elect Eisenhower also took the plane on a trip to Korea to meet troops stationed there. Air Force One was first officially used as a call sign by Columbine III, which was used for most of Eisenhower's presidency. The plane inspired the Air Force One call sign when it nearly had a mid-air collision above New York City in 1953 . The aircraft, a Lockheed Constellation also took the 1950s president to Korea to visit the troops before he formally took office . The airplane (left) was restored in the 1990s by Mel Christler and his business partners but never achieved the glory of the 1950s (right) However, the Columbine II inspired the name after a confusion of call numbers by air traffic control almost caused a mid-air collision between the plane and another aircraft in 1953 above New York. Columbine I was a plane Eisenhower used in World War II. The former general's first presidential aircraft, which also had marble floors and sleeping quarters, is the only former Air Force One plane that is not in a museum. Its current owners are asking $1.5million for the plane, which has been parked in Arizona since 2005. The airfield makes money by leasing pieces of land. Eisenhower, center, used the  airplane until November 1954, when it was replaced. Above, Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson (left) and Secretary of Interior Douglas McKay (right) in September 1954 . Mary Jean Eisenhower (far right and left as child) wants to restore the Columbine II to use for veterans' flights in memory of her grandfather (left) No hangar protects it from the suns rays, which are gradually breaking down both the exterior and interior. Eisenhower's granddaughter Marie Jean is now working with the National Airline Museum in Kansas City to buy it, according to History Net. Ms Eisenhower, who traveled with her grandfather as a child said: 'As soon as I saw the interior of Columbine II again, the hair on the back of my neck stood up.' She plans on restoring the plane to the way it was for the president and giving veterans flights to thank them for their service to the country. Though refurbished by its current owners in the 1990s, the plane is not the same as during its heyday. 'In its glory days it had marbled floors,' Miller said. 'Now it just looks like any old, beat-up aircraft sitting there,' airport manager Steve Miller told the Arizona DailyStar. After its use for the commander in chief, it became a plane for VIPs such as Eisenhower's vice president Richard Nixon and Queen Elizabeth II. It was officially retired in 1968. Mel Christler bought the plane in 1970, originally intending to use it for crop dusting and fighting forest fires. He later sold some of its parts after discovering that the landing gear was not right. Eisenhower reportedly used a desk on the plane to write his Atoms For Peace speech to the UN about nuclear warfare . The airplane used by Eisenhower (right) was bought from the military in 1970 by Mr Christler, who was interested in turning it into a crop duster . It was not until the Smithsonian called in 1980 that Mr Christler knew he had a piece of history. The businessman and partners restored the plane to flying condition for $150,000 and took it to shows, though multiple attempts at selling have been unsuccessful. Bids at a 1998 auction were reportedly as high as $1.4million, though the owner did not think they were credible, according to a short history of the aircraft. Mr Christler died in 2005, and his partners are looking for someone else to take the plane and restore it, according to their Facebook page. Restoration will cost an estimated $200,000. Bids at a 1998 auction were thought to have reached $1.4million, though the plane was not sold and its owners are still looking for buyers .","The Lockheed Constellation called Columbine II was used by 34th president in 1953 and 1954 .

"A Brisbane woman has lost a court case after she accused her Catholic Church employer of sex discrimination when the organisation fired her for being involved in an online polyamorous community. Susan Bunning was hired by Centacare in 2007 and worked for the company until August 2013 when the Catholic social services organisation terminated her employment after discovering her contact details listed on the Brisbane Poly Group website. A group calling themselves 'Brisbane Poly People' describes the community as a 'social and discussion group based in Brisbane for all who are interested in open relationships, polyamory, and the varied alternatives to monogamy'. Susan Bunning was fired from Catholic organisation Centacare after the company discovered her details on a polyamorous website . The Federal Circuit Court judgement showed that Ms Bunning had been accused by Centacare of gross misconduct, breaching the company's code of conduct and bringing the it into disrepute. Ms Bunning was informed that her lifestyle contradicted the morals of the Catholic Church, and was given five weeks salary after she was listed online as a member of the Poly Group. Her details had been listed on the site as a 'poly-friendly counselor' between 2011 and 2012 following a request from one of the group members, which was pointed out to her during a meeting in August 2013 with two managers of Centacare. She was confronted by her colleagues with a printed out list of the members, and was questioned whether her involvement was for professional or personal reasons. Ms Bunning claimed that she had been discriminated against as because of her sex, and originally made several submissions to the Australian Human Rights Commission, who dismissed her allegations as 'misconceived'. Justice Vasta concluded that her 'behaviour' differed from 'sexual orientation' Ms Bunning worked for Centacare 2007 and worked for the company until August 2013 . After her complaint to the AHRC was denied, she then took her case to the Federal Circuit Court, where Judge Salvator Vasta handed down his judgement on February 11, and dismissed the appeal on the basis that it had no 'reasonable prospect of success'. Ms Bunning told the court that she had been dismissed because 'of the characteristics that appertain generally to persons who are polyamorous', after she was accused of seven counts of gross misconduct. Justice Vasta concluded that her 'behaviour' differed from 'sexual orientation', and stated that being polyamorous was rather a 'manifestation' of her orientation. 'Sexual orientation is how one is, rather than how one manifests that state of being. The manifestation of that state of being can take many forms,' Justice Vasta said. 'If the contention of the applicant were correct, many people whose sexual activity might label them as sado-masochists, coprophiliacs or urophiliacs could claim that such is more than mere behaviour; it is in fact their very sexual orientation,' Justice Vasta said. The Federal Circuit Court judgement showed that Ms Bunning had been accused  of gross misconduct . Figures for the US indicate that almost half a million people identify as polyamorous . Justice Vasta said that the result would be of 'absurdity' if the court accepted polyamory as sexual orientation, and could lead people to campaign for the protection of paedophilia and necrophilia under the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984. He ruled that despite finding his ruling 'unpalatable', Ms Bunning should be allowed to 'ventilate her grievance', 'no matter what the merits or the probability of success' on her claim. There are currently no figures on the number of people in Australia who consider themselves polyamorous, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. However, figures for the US indicate that almost half a million people identify as polyamorous, a behaviour which has been defined as 'ethical non-monogamy', . The Brisbane Poly People and Centacare have been contacted for comment.","Susan Bunning was fired from her job for her 'polyamorous lifestyle'

"A woman ordered to stay away from a couple for 10 years after she admitted to terrorizing them in revenge for being outbid on a home in San Diego has moved in just a mile down the road. Kathy Rowe, 53, pleaded guilty last month to stalking and was sentenced to one year of home electronic surveillance and five years probation. A judge also ordered her to stay away from Jerry Rice, 40, and Janice Ruhter, 37, for 10 years, but much to the couple’s distress she and her family have just moved into the same neighborhood. Scroll down for video . Kathy Rowe, 53, pleaded guilty last month to stalking and was sentenced to one year of home electronic surveillance and five years probation . ‘I kind of think she has more of a reason now to attack us. So obviously, we’re concerned for the family,’ Rice told ABC’s 20/20 on Friday. The couple have admitted that the stress caused by their ordeal with Rowe has caused them to take medication and having counselling. Ms. Rowe however told 20/20 that despite her reign of terror she didn't intend to scare them. 'I may be the least liked person in San Diego County. A horrible, evil person who wanted to harm this nice couple. I did not intend to harm them,' she said. 'I had put so much hope into this house. It’s almost like, you know, you hear bluebirds sing and music play. I walked in, it was my house. And when I found out we didn’t get it, it was devastating. It was heartbreaking.' Rice and Ruhter, who have a young son and daughter, were targeted by Rowe after they bought the home in late 2011. Jerry Rice, 40 and Janice Ruhter, 37, have admitted that the stress caused by their ordeal with Rowe has caused them to take medication and having counselling . Soon after they moved in, the couple had their mail stopped, $1,000 of magazine subscriptions delivered and Valentine's cards with Rice's name sent to other women on their quiet suburban street in Carmel Valley. Even more sinister, when Mr Rice searched his wife's name online, he discovered in horror that there were ads for sex parties at their home, entitled 'Carmel Valley Freak Show'. Mrs Rowe, pretending to be the couple, had advertised for men to visit the home while Rice was not there and force themselves upon Ruhter, claiming it was her fantasy to be raped. Ruhter's photo and address were included in the posts which were made sometime between October 2011 and June 2012. 'I love to be surprised and have a man just show up at my door and force his way in the door and on me, totally taking me while I say no,' Rowe wrote to one man who responded, according to reports. One man did show up at the couple's home but was thwarted once by a locked gate and a second time when the husband answered the door. 'Dream home': Rowe told a California court last month that it was 'devastating' when she lost the home, pictured, due to a miscommunication with real estate agents in 2011 . Rowe, pretending to be the couple, had advertised for men to visit the home while Rice was not there and force themselves upon Ruhter, claiming it was her fantasy to be raped . The couple contacted the police who traced the emails to Rowe. Rice, a school teacher, and Ruhter, a hospital lab scientist, told People this week that the campaign of harassment badly damaged their marriage. Mr Rice began to neglect his family and became obsessed with watching online videos on how to install security lights and cameras. The couple now attend therapy sessions to rebuild their marriage. They both also spend two nights of the week practicing self-defense martial arts after the harassment destroyed their sense of safety in their own home. Ms Ruhter added: 'It was a huge stress in our life for so long. We are trying to heal the best way we can.' Rowe was sentenced last month to a year of electronic surveillance and five years of probation for terrorizing the young family. Rowe said that she tormented the couple as revenge because the home (pictured) they outbid her for had been perfect for her sick husband and disabled daughter . The 53-year-old, who was fired from her job as a county administrative analyst, was charged with  solicitation of rape and stalking charges in June 2012. The prosecutor said the charges were filed because Rowe's actions went far beyond a prank. In December, Rowe entered a plea bargain over the stalking charges, in exchange for prosecutors to drop felony charges of soliciting rape and sodomy and misdemeanor charges of identity theft and harassment. A conviction for soliciting rape would have required Rowe to register for life as a sex offender. In court last month, Rowe apologized to the couple for what she had put them through. 'I just wanted to say how humiliated I am by my behavior – that this is not representative of who I am. I've never behaved like this – never will again,' she said. She said she acted due to the stress she was under and never intended to cause the couple any harm. Rice and Ruhter both made victim impact statements at her sentencing. Rowe posted ads online encouraging strange men to go to the home (pictured) and rape Ms Ruhter . 'The home should be a place of safety and sanctuary,' Ruhter said. 'But I never truly felt this way in our house. I felt most secure away from my home. The house became my prison.' Rice added: 'Had law enforcement not intervened in this case, I am certain Mrs. Rowe would have continued her attacks until she successfully brought physical harm to a member of my family.' In a letter to a judge last year, Rowe explained it had been 'devastating' when she lost the house due to miscommunication with real estate agents, and a more attractive bid from the other couple. She had her heart set on the home because it was a single story, to accommodate her severely disabled daughter, and had a pool, to provide exercise for her husband who has stage 4 stomach cancer. 'The anger and grief over losing that house (and especially in the way we did) drove me to behave in a very childish way and to do what I thought were childish pranks to let off steam and ease the pain,' Rowe said in January. 'I never intended for them to be hurtful.'","Kathy Rowe, 53, pleaded guilty last month to stalking and was sentenced to one year of home electronic surveillance .

"A man who shot dead his friend's pregnant wife while playing with a revolver 'gunslinger-style' will not face any criminal charges, Florida prosecutors have announced. William DeHayes was showing off his gun collection to his friend Carson Hoover and his friend's wife Katherine Lynn Hoover, 25, when the tragedy occurred. DeHayes invited the Carsons over to his $50,000 home in Brooksville, Hernando County in Florida on July 26, 2014 when he began playing with his .22 calibre revolver. Katherine Lynn Hoover, left, was five months' pregnant, right, when she was shot in the head by a friend . William DeHayes, pictured, was spinning his revolver around his finger 'gunslinger-style' when it fired . Witnesses said DeHayes spun the weapon around on his forefinger, 'gunslinger-style' when it went off, hitting Mrs Hoover in the head. Mrs Hoover, who was five months pregnant, was rushed to hospital where she underwent an emergency caesarean section. Unfortunately, the baby Rehlin Lee Hoover, died 30 minutes after he was born. Prosecutors in Hernando County, which is about 40 miles north of Tampa, decided that the shooting was accidental. However, the decision has been strongly criticised by Mrs Hoover's mother Donna Bryan, who has written to the Governor Rick Scott, State Attorney General Pam Bondi as well as the state attorney in Hernando County, Brad King. Speaking to the Tampa Tribune, Mrs Bryan said: 'I don’t understand. People go to jail for DUI. This man killed my daughter and grandson. I feel that my daughter deserves justice. She did nothing to deserve being killed and neither did my grandson.' Mrs Carson was shot dead inside DeHayes' $50,000 home, pictured,  in Brooville, Hernando County, Florida . Mrs Bryan said she had spoken to her daughter on the day she was shot. 'She called, and she’s like, ""We just bought the baby’s outfit he’s coming home in, but you’re not going to be happy."" She goes, ""It’s camouflage!"" I don’t like camouflage, but she really did, and she was all excited. They had baby books in camouflage. The baby’s room was going to be in camouflage.' Mrs Bryan said her grandson Nicholas, 7, has been living with the herself and her husband since the shooting. She said: 'My grandson (Nicholas) is alive, and I have him in therapy. He’s obviously upset and doesn’t understand why his mommy isn’t here. He asks where his brother is, and I tell him they went to heaven. He says, ""Mommy didn’t even say goodbye to me."" ' State attorney Mr King wrote back to Mrs Bryan and claimed that he could not prosecute DeHayes because, even though he was grossly negligent, his behaviour did not constitute a crime. At the time of the shooting, DeHayes was not under the influence of any illegal drugs or alcohol, although he was on prescription medication at the time. Mrs Bryan has begun a petition to convince prosecutors to reverse their decision not to charge DeHayes after the incident.","Katherine Lynn Hoover was 'accidentally' shot in the head by her friend .

"A baby has survived a harrowing start to life after his mother gave birth to him on a train toilet and he fell through the hole onto the tracks. The 22-year-old woman fainted in the tiny toilet cubicle on Monday after giving birth on the train, which had briefly halted before reaching Hanumangarh station in western Rajasthan state. 'The woman felt acute labour pain, so she went to the toilet to relieve herself and gave birth to a baby boy who slipped down through the toilet bowl and fell on the tracks,' Subhash Vishnoi, senior railway police official, said. Most Indian trains have squat toilets with chutes that empty directly onto the tracks. A baby boy has survived slipping through the chute onto a train track. File image used . Most Indian trains have western-style and squat toilets with filthy chutes that empty directly onto the tracks. The train had already left for Hanumangarh by the time the woman's family members found her unconscious in the toilet. A local guard spotted the newborn crying on the tracks and informed the police, who admitted the baby to a nearby hospital. 'When the woman and her husband found their newborn alive and safe, they were very happy,' police official Ram Singh said. 'They had not expected that the newborn would be alive.' A railway spokesman said once the train reached its destination, the mother was taken to Hanumangarh hospital, BBC Hindi reported. He added: 'After being rescued, the baby was initially taken to the local hospital where he was given first aid. He was also later shifted to the town hospital.' The hospital's chief medical officer, Dr SP Rohilla, confirmed both the mother and baby were doing fine. The baby had no serious injuries, although he was born underweight.","The woman fainted in toilet cubicle moments after giving birth on the train .

"Grammar schools should be allowed to expand and accept more children, David Cameron said yesterday. In marked contrast to previous statements, the Prime Minister said he strongly supported the right of ‘good’ schools – including grammars – to grow. His comments will be welcomed by Tory supporters who say new selective schools will help drive up standards and offer better social mobility to working and middle class children. David Cameron today backed the creation of new grammar schools - despite opposing them in opposition . It was also seen as a coded endorsement of plans by an existing grammar in Kent to build a new ‘satellite’ school nearby – a move that could set an important precedent for other institutions. Mr Cameron’s comments contradict those he made in May 2007, when he declared them to be an ‘electoral albatross’ during a major party row over the issue. At the time, he insisted there was a ‘hopelessness’ about calls for more grammars because they represented the idea that ‘this country will only ever be able to offer a decent education to a select few’. MP Graham Brady resigned as the party’s Europe spokesman over the issue. The Prime Minister visited the Sussex Functional Skills Centre in Brighton, East Sussex, today to meet a group of apprentices . But recent months have seen a growing clamour from some backbench Tory MPs for more grammars. Two senior Cabinet ministers, Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, have also backed plans for grammars in their constituencies. Mr Cameron’s comments will also be seen as a response to Ukip, which has made support for more grammar schools a major plank of its education policy. Addressing supporters yesterday at a school in Hove, East Sussex, the PM said: ‘I strongly support the right of all good schools to expand. I think that’s very important and that should include grammar schools. 'Under this Government grammar schools have been able to expand and that is all to the good.’ The Tory leader said he wanted every parent to have ‘what I have for my three young children’ who attend a ‘good state primary’ in London. ‘It shouldn’t be a lottery, it shouldn’t be a postcode matter, it should be something everyone gets, the right to have a good school place for your children,’ he added. ‘The only way you can do that is to have more good schools and that’s exactly what this Government’s programme has been all about.’ Mr Cameron’s three children attend a Church of England state primary school in West London. His daughter Nancy, 11, is expected to attend a top state secondary from September. The PM’s comments came as he responded to a question about a proposal by Weald of Kent girls’ grammar school in Tonbridge to open a new campus nine miles away in Sevenoaks. In December 2013 the plans were rejected by the Department for Education. Mr Cameron said he did not want to ‘pre-empt’ a fresh decision, but added: ‘The principle is very clear: good schools should have the freedom to expand.’ On Monday the Mail reported that Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was ‘on the verge’ of signing off the plan, which is in Mr Fallon’s Kent constituency. Mr Cameron visited the Royal Naval base in Portsmouth, Hampshire, today where he was shown  plans with Captain Iain Greenlees (left) and base commander Commodore Jeremy Rigby . The former education secretary Michael Gove blocked the expansion of grammar schools. His successor Nicky Morgan (right) is considering whether to allow one grammar to open a new campus .","Prime Minister said good grammar schools should be allowed to expand .
He hinted that he backed expansion of a Kent grammar to a new campus .

"Andrew McNicholas had a well-paid job and a buzzing social life. But five years ago his world came crashing down after he developed crippling cluster headaches. Also known as 'suicide' headaches, these are said to cause the most severe pain known to man (female sufferers say it's far worse than childbirth). 'One Thursday the pain hit me at work,' says Andrew, now 46. 'It felt as if there was a knife going through my eyeball. It was the worst pain I'd ever experienced.' Scroll down for video . Andrew McNicholas  developed crippling cluster headaches five years ago . Since that first attack, he has three or four cluster headaches every day, lasting from between 40 minutes to three hours. He's tried 15 types of medications, and clinical trials, to treat them, but none worked and some caused severe side-effects including blood poisoning, heart palpitations and vomiting. The attacks were so debilitating that Andrew had to quit his job as senior manager at an accountancy firm in March 2010. No longer earning, he was forced to sell his home, and has rarely been able to go out. But a new handheld device has made his life 'liveable' again. It targets the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the abdomen and relays messages to and from the heart, lungs and digestive system. The nerve helps regulate key functions such as breathing and heart rate - but scientists increasingly believe it plays a role in a range of conditions, from depression to asthma and heart failure. In September 2013, Andrew took part in a clinical trial at the Walton Centre NHS Trust, Liverpool, testing the use of the device, called GammaCore. It's applied to the neck and sends small electric pulses into the nerve. They are also known as 'suicide' headaches, and female sufferers say it's far worse than childbirth . These pulses are thought to reduce levels of certain neurotransmitters - chemical messengers in the brain.One theory is that people who suffer from severe frequent headaches may produce too many neurotransmitters and, as a result, sensations that are not normally painful, such as seeing light, are misinterpreted by the brain, causing headache. Users apply the battery-powered device to the neck for around two minutes when they feel a headache coming on. 'It always makes the pain less severe, and can stop my attacks within 25 minutes,' says Andrew, who lives in Manchester with his partner Kevin, 31. 'It's improved my pain by around 40 per cent and I feel living with this condition isn't hopeless any more, so I have fewer dark days.' It's not a cure-all. When 19 people with cluster headaches took part in a trial at King's College Hospital, London, half found the device started to reduce symptoms after 11 minutes. For this half it also helped them reduce their medication by half and reduced the frequency of their attacks from an average of 4½ to 2½ a day, says Peter Goadsby, professor of neurology at King's College London. He is now using the GammaCore, which is applied to the neck and sends small electric pulses . The only side-effect was a slightly uncomfortable tugging feeling in the neck when it was used. While acknowledging that more studies are needed to check its efficacy, Professor Goadsby says: 'If a proportion of people with a dreadful problem get some benefit, that's a good step forward.' As well as cluster headaches, vagus nerve stimulation is being used to treat patients with epilepsy. Here, it's usually given via a surgically-implanted electrode, but in recent years external devices have been used, too. It is thought to send messages to the brain which interfere with the chemicals that cause seizures. 'It doesn't always work brilliantly, but it's often the best treatment we have for epilepsy,' says Richard Selway, a consultant neurosurgeon at King's College Hospital. Vagus nerve stimulation is being used in some cases of depression, too. This followed the discovery that epilepsy patients being treated with vagus nerve stimulation reported it improved their depression (even when the treatment did not help their epilepsy). It is thought the pulses alter brain chemistry, which helps to improve mood. Researchers are now looking at its benefits for other health problems, including obesity and heart failure. Scientists have found that stimulating the vagus nerve slows the heart, allowing it to fill more with blood and then pump powerfully. The mild current given off by these stimulators don't affect organ function. There is also ongoing research into its anti-inflammatory effects. A Dutch study published in December found that patients with rheumatoid arthritis given vagus nerve stimulation experienced a significant reduction in pain after just six weeks. A tiny disc was implanted in their chest, which was attached by a wire to the vagus nerve in the neck. The team said similar techniques could reverse other chronic conditions such as diabetes, as it may influence the levels of hormones produced by the body, including insulin. Estimated number of work and school days lost due to migraines every year . Meanwhile, a team at Imperial College London is working on a microchip designed to stimulate the vagus nerve and suppress appetite, helping obese people lose weight. The microchip, implanted through keyhole surgery, is placed around a nerve in the gut, which is in turn connected to the vagus nerve. The microchip senses high levels of hunger hormones such as ghrelin and sends electrical signals through the vagus nerve. These supposedly trick the brain into thinking that you are full. As Professor Christofer Toumazou, director of the Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology at Imperial, explains: 'The chip only provides therapy if it diagnoses that you are producing too much hunger hormone.' The technique may even be useful for Alzheimer's. Simulating the vagus nerve may encourage the brain's locus coeruleus to release a form of adrenaline that boosts alertness and memory, says Mr Selway. But is a handheld device or an implant better? Professor Goadsby believes the external devices are the way forward. 'They allow patients to test whether something works before having a device implanted, and if they can be produced cheaply and used at home, that saves the cost and time of using a surgeon.' However, Mr Selway says one benefit of implanted devices is that patients don't need to remember to use it, which can be very helpful for the elderly. 'Vagus nerve stimulation is rarely a miracle cure, but it's a useful push in the right direction.' GammaCore, which costs £250 for the device, is available privately. Treatment must be approved by a doctor.","Andrew McNicholas, 46, from Manchester developed 'suicide' headaches .

"It’s a common problem: You sit down for dinner and your jeans fit perfectly, but the more you eat the tighter they get. At the moment you have to manually undo the zip to feel comfortable, but in the future your zip may be able to adjust automatically. A researcher from MIT has created the Zipperbot that uses sensors to open and close the teeth in response to movement - such as an expanding waistline. Scroll down for video . The Zipperbot was designed by MIT researcher Adam Whiton as part of his Sartorial Robotics thesis. In a video, the robotic zipper is shown moving autonomously across a zip placed on a flat surface as well as on material wrapped around an arm (pictured) The Zipperbot was designed by Adam Whiton as part of his Sartorial Robotics thesis. In a video, the zipper is shown moving across a zip placed on a flat surface as well as on material wrapped around an arm. Zipperbot uses optical sensors to accurately line-up the teeth so the zip doesn’t become jammed or snag on the surrounding material. It additionally uses motion sensors to detect movement. During a demonstration, Mr Whiton added the zipperbot to a skirt which released and tightened in relation to the wearer’s movements. The leather XOO Belt looks like a normal belt, but has a charger built into the buckle. It is held in place using magnets so it can be easily connected and disconnected. The belt, which comes in black and brown, can be charged up like an ordinary smartphone via a USB cable and has enough power to charge an iPhone 6 from scratch or 'pretty much any device' in around three hours. The cable is concealed behind the leather part of the belt, which contains a flexible battery. And in theory, this means it could be used to loosen or tighten after a meal, or between standing up and sitting down. Other uses include helping children or people with disabilities dress themselves, or self-closing zips on biohazard suits, for example. Mr Whiton said: ‘Zipperbot, a robotic continuous closure for fabric edge joining, was developed to explore autonomous control of a sartorial gesture and performed as a wearable robot which was evaluated through social interactions. ‘Clothing is a uniquely human pursuit and is nearly universal in its adoption and use. ‘It plays a prominent role in our individual cultures transmitting a mixture of social signals and meanings through the semiotics of fashion. ‘Merging robotics and fashion within the practice of Sartorial Robotics will enhance the explorations of identities for both humans and robots. At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, a French firm demonstrated its self-adjusting belt called Belty. The smart prototype syncs wirelessly to an app to track steps, loosen and tighten as wearer's move, and even warns them when they're being lazy.

In theory, this means it could be used to loosen or tighten after a meal, or between standing up and sitting down . The metal and plastic model was created by Paris-based designers Bertrand Dupla and Carine Coulm at Emiota. If the waistline begins to expand, the belt warns the user via this app that they're putting on weight. When sitting down, the belt expands to give the wearer more breathing space, and it automatically tightens when the wearer stands up again. It does this by tracking tension on sensors fitted throughout the belt. At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, French firm Emiota demonstrated its self-adjusting belt called Belty (pictured).

"A 93-year-old man has been charged with 170,000 counts of accessory to murder on allegations he served as an SS guard at the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland. The defendant, whose name wasn't disclosed in line with privacy laws, allegedly served in Auschwitz from January 1942 to June 1944, the Detmold state court said yesterday. It is claimed the man was assigned to the Auschwitz I camp but also helped supervise new prisoners, largely Jews, as they arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau, the part of the camp complex where most of its 1.1million victims were killed. Scroll down for video . A man, 93, has been charged with 170,000 counts of accessory to murder following claims he was a guard at Auschwitz. Pictured is the camp's front gate with the infamous sign which reads: 'Work sets you free' Defense attorney Johannes Salmen said his client has acknowledged being at Auschwitz I, but denies being assigned to Birkenau or being involved in killings. The North-Rhine Westphalia centre said the accused was deployed to the Nazi death camp in January 1942, according to The Local. There, he worked as a member of the SS Death's Head guard battalion and was responsible for guarding trains of Jews arriving at the death camp. He is also alleged to have worked in 'selection', which involved marking newly-arrived inmates for immediate death or sending them to work. It comes just months after Oskar Groening, also 93, was charged with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for his role as a guard at the camp. The sergeant worked at the camp in German occupied Poland for two-and-a-half years and he was charged with sorting the possessions of the inmates and collecting and tallying any money that was on them. At least 1.1 million prisoners died at Auschwitz, around 90 per cent of them Jewish. In one period between May and June 1944, 425,000 Hungarian Jews went there and around 300,000 were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Women prisoners at Auschwitz stand in a line after it was liberated by the Russians in January, 1945 .

There are around 30 former Auschwitz guards currently under close watch after federal investigators last year recommend state prosecutors pursue charges against them. Pictured is the camp in 1958 . He was never punished after the war, a tribunal cleared him of involvement in 1948, but Groening - who worked as the manager of a glass factory - has openly talked about his time as a guard and said that he witnessed atrocities. Groening, who lives near the Lueneburg Heath in Lower Saxony, is one of around 30 former Auschwitz guards who federal investigators recommended last year that state prosecutors pursue charges against under a new precedent in German law. Groening himself has openly talked about his time as a guard and said while he witnessed horrific atrocities, he didn't commit any crimes himself. In 2005, he told Der Spiegel magazine he recalled one incident on 'ramp duty' when he heard a baby crying. 'I saw another SS soldier grab the baby by the legs,' he said. 'He smashed the baby's head against the iron side of a truck until it was silent.'","A German man aged 93 is facing 170,000 counts of accessory to murder .

Location-based dating apps, such as Tinder (screenshot pictured) and the League, have a combined total of 91 million users. Now a new study has found that nearly two thirds these app users are men – and one in five will pay for premium services . The study, done by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app, according to a report in the Guardian. 'Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. 'This might make them three times more likely than the average internet user to be doing this, but it does underline the importance of ad-supported models.' Last year, a similar study by Pew Research Center found that men were more active on dating apps and sites. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base.  According to Tinder, users will log on to the company's app on average 11 times a day. Women spend as much as 8.5 minutes swiping left and right during a single session, while men spend 7.2 minutes . The research found that 13 per cent of US males had used a dating app or site, compared to only nine per cent of women in the states. The report on usage trends comes as Tinder prepares to launch Tinder Plus, a new premium account that will see people pay for added features. The service has already been tested in the UK, but is now about to launch in the US, according to Techcrunch - with an expected price of $6.99 per month. The paid update is expected to allow users to search in other locations, although they may be charged extra for this. Tinder sees more than 850 million swipes and more than 10 million matches made every single day, with 2 billion matches made to date - but so far has not monetised its app. A new version of the app will display a big yellow 'undo' button on the home screen, which members of Tinder Plus will be able to use, but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service. According to Tinder, users will log on to the company's app on average 11 times a day. Women spend as much as 8.5 minutes swiping left and right during a single session, while men spend 7.2 minutes. The company claims to have 40 million users, trailing behind Chinese dating app, Momo, which is said to have 60 million active users. Other emerging players include Bumble and Hinge. Bumble is a dating app that emphasises safety and puts women in control. The Tinder rival works on the same principal as the original, but only women can start conversations. They've created female-focused marketing material urging ladies to 'take the leap'. Hinge, meanwhile, links users on the basis of two factors; proximity, like Tinder, and social 'friends of friends' connections, using data from Facebook. According to the company, 99 per cent of its users are college-educated, most commonly working in industries such as banking, media and fashion. The GlobalWebIndex report also found that location-based dating apps are gaining the popularity in areas such as the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Vietnam.

"Charged with murder: Tobacco tycoon Mohammed Nisham has been accused of killing a security guard because he was too slow opening the gates to his apartment complex in the Indian state of Kerala . An Indian millionaire has been charged with murder after allegedly ramming his Hummer into his security guard because he was being too slow to open his gates. Mohammed Nisham is accused of chasing the guard with his SUV inside an apartment complex  last month, squeezing him against a wall before beating him with an iron rod. He was reportedly angry over a delay in opening the gate after returning home late one night two weeks ago. The 50-year-old guard, K Chandrabose, died yesterday after being in hospital on life-support in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Doctors treating Chandrabose said 'his heart had not been functioning properly following the impact of the internal injuries,' according to the Press Trust of India news agency. Nisham was in custody in a jail near the town of Thrissur where he lives, police official Biju Kumar said today. He has had several police cases filed against him, including one for allowing his nine-year-old son to drive a Ferrari on a public road in 2013. He was granted bail on some cases and was ordered to pay fines for others. India's economic boom has created a class of super-rich, whose excesses are frequently in the news. Nisham has a thriving tobacco and real estate business in Kerala. He reportedly also owns hotel and jewellery businesses in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Allegations: Nisham is accused of chasing the guard with his Hummer (like the one pictured) inside an apartment complex last month, squeezing him against a wall before beating him with an iron rod . When he was charged with allowing his son to drive the Ferrari F430, police records showed he owned 18 high-end cars worth an estimated $4m (£2.6m), including a Bentley and a Lamborghini. He let his son take the wheel of the £127,000 supercar on his birthday - with nobody else in the vehicle except for his six-year-old brother. The boy drove it for several hundred metres along a  road - all filmed by his proud family, who then uploaded the footage to YouTube. Kerala Police registered a case against Nisham  for uploading a video of an illegal act, sending out a wrong message to the world and allowing a child to drive a vehicle. Reckless: Nisham has had several police cases filed against him, including one for allowing his nine-year-old son (above) to drive a Ferrari on a public road in 2013 which he filmed and posted on YouTube .

"Mary Beard says she was left 'wanting to cry' after she was bombarded with abuse for speaking out in favour of free speech. The celebrated academic joined other campaigners in calling on universities not to ban speakers perceived to be hostile to transgender people. But just hours after a letter - signed by Professor Beard and many others including gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell - was published, she faced a torrent of abuse on Twitter. Mary Beard and Peter Tatchell suffered a barrage of abuse after signing a letter calling on universities to allow speakers perceived to be 'transphobic' to appear before students in the interests of free speech . The original letter claimed it was 'illiberal and undemocratic' for universities to ban lecturers and academics deemed 'transphobic', meaning prejudiced against transsexual people. But the letter sparked an angry backlash from some in the transgender community and Professor Beard was later branded an 'unrepentant bigot' and Mr Tatchell was called a 'parasite'. Professor Beard, 60, later told on her blog how the relentless abuse had caused her difficulty sleeping. She wrote: 'For two days I have been bombarded by tweets (and a few emails). 'Some tweeters have been very polite in their disagreement; for which, thank you. Others not quite so (I should be clear, though, there have been no threats of violence). 'I got 60 tweets in the space of about an hour from one person alone.' Mr Tatchell said the attacks were particularly hurtful coming after his history of protesting against prejudice . Professor Beard added: 'Last night I went to bed wanting to weep... It wasn't the force of any remark, it was the relentless pummelling of attack on the basis of extraordinary loaded, sometimes quite wrong, readings of the letter. 'Cumulative harassment is what it felt like, though I am sure it wasn't meant that way.' Mr Tatchell, 63, said he has received more than 5,000 messages attacking him since the letter was published, some of which, he said, were threatening. He told the Independent: 'On Saturday night, after the first attacks started, I couldn't sleep. I was so upset about being misrepresented as an anti-trans bigot. 'I woke up exhausted, and on my way to a LGBT conference, I tripped on the pavement, hit my head and suffered concussion, which I'm still feeling today.'","Acadamic co-signed letter calling for free speech in universities .

"A 'gangster's moll' who blew more than £75,000 of drugs money on a luxury lifestyle will only have to pay back £800.

She spent thousands of pounds during a four-year spending spree, including £10,477 on her dream wedding at the Vale Resort - a luxury hotel near Cardiff used by sports stars and celebrities. Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'There was a lavish lifestyle which wasn't sustainable on the declared earnings of Mr and Mrs Hugh. 'The majority of transactions were dealt with in cash installments. 'Mrs Hugh knew or should have known the money had come from crime.' The mother-of-two spent £2,260 on dental work and £2,345 on bridal accessories ahead of her wedding to ex-Welsh Light Heavyweight champion boxer Justyn. She also paid £5,000 in cash for a sporty Mini Cooper - which she later upgraded for a £19,570 Mini Countryman.

"Fresh off inauguration to a second full term, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is going to war with his state's universities, proposing at $300 million reduction to their funding in his annual budget. The 2.5 percent cut in funding to Wisconsin's 13 public universities would consume the budgets of at least five colleges on the flagship Madison campus, that location's chancellor has said - and then some. The move sets up Walker, a presumed Republican presidential candidate, for a nasty political fight at home just as he turns his attention to the national stage. Back on the attack: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, now in his second term, is taking on his state's university system. He wants to cut $300 million - setting up for another nasty political fight with public employees. In 2012 he was forced to compete in a recall election after he enraged Democrats with legislation that curbed collective bargaining rights for most of the state's employees . Hundreds of students and faculty members at the Madison campus have already begun protesting, the Washington Post reports. And last night, the Milwaukee Teachers' Education Association and other teachers' groups staged a demonstration outside the 47-year-old governor's parents' home that a local news publication said brought out more than 100 people. Walker is beginning his second term with the same type of bold action that incited Democrats to try to have him thrown out of office less than a year into his tenure as governor. After Walker championed legislation that curbed the collective bargaining rights of most of public employees, state workers, with the backing of local and national unions, sought to have him recalled. Groups as large as 100,000 gathered to protest the 'Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill' - Republicans' answer to the state's $3.6 billion budget deficit. Against all odds, Walker became the first U.S. governor to keep the keys to the executive mansion in 2012 when Wisconsin voters again elected him. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in June 2014 that the legislation was legal, and in November Walker was elected to lead the state for a third time. Picking another fight, Walker is now asking the Republican-led Wisconsin legislature to slash funding for the state's publicly-run higher education institutions in exchange for a two-year tuition freeze and the relinquishment of authority to university officials to control staff pay and campus construction projects. 'It’s very much like what we did four years ago,' Walker said during a forum in London last week, according to the Washington Post. Half of the annual savings would be passed on to taxpayers, the governor's office has said. 'Governor Walker is proposing to provide the University of Wisconsin System with the authority and flexibility that it has been seeking for years, while freezing tuition for two years to maintain college affordability for our state’s hard-working families,' a spokesman for Walker told the New York Times. 'These reforms will give the U.W. System the power to transform higher education in this state for the future by empowering leaders, protecting taxpayers and promoting long-term stability.' Alex Walker, the son of Gov. Walker, tweeted this photo last night of his father's critics protesting outside of a home they believed to be the governor's personal residence but Walker's sons say is their grandsparents' home . The measure, if passed, would have the short-term effect of forcing the University of Wisconsin- Madison to layoff teachers, the campus's chancellor, Rebecca Blank, told the Times. Blank also raised the possibility of out-of-state tuition increases. And even if she eliminated the schools of business, law, nursing, pharmacy and veterinary medicine, Blank told the Times that still wouldn't cover UW-M's portion of the deficit. The Madison university is urging nearly a half million of alumni to contact Walker's office and beg him to renege on his plan. Last night activists swarmed a home belonging to Walker's parents that protesters and news reports mistook for Walker's personal residence and chanted, 'Hey hey, ho ho, Scott Walker’s got to go.' 'The students united will never be defeated,' they shouted, FOX6 said, and, 'Students are not for sale.' 'He brought budget cuts to all our houses, and today we brought it to his,' Wisconsin Jobs Now Director Jennifer Epps-Addison told local publication Wauwatosa Now. One of Walker's sons, Matt, said on Twitter, however that his grandparents live in the home, not his father, the governor. Walker added Marquette University as a student but left before he graduated to take a job with the American Red Cross. But one of his two sons, Alex, attends the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Wisconsin State Representative Chris Taylor addresses the crowd during the 'Stop the Cuts-Save UW' rally on the Library Mall at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Saturday. The rally was held to protest the $300 million cut Walker has proposed to the UW budget . A Madison resident holds a sigh at the protest mocking Walker, who didn't finish college, over the budget cuts . At the London event Walker noted that his opponents wrongly predicted the 2011 law 'would be the death of public education in my state.' 'Back then I had two kids in public high schools, and I said I have a vested interest then, just like I do now in the UW system,' he stated. 'With our authority, the same thing will happen with the University of Wisconsin system.' Democratic State Sen. Jennifer Shilling, minority leader of the Wisconsin legislature's upper chamber,' accused Walker of allowing his political ambitions to creep into his responsibilities as the state's chief executive. His budget, she told the Post, 'looks like a presidential document.' 'Don’t underestimate the intelligence of Wisconsinites: They know this is fodder for a presidential campaign,' Shilling said. Walker is not term limited and could take another go at governor in 2018 if he doesn't win the presidency in 2016 - assuming he runs. While he hasn't made official his campaign, Walker's interest in the presidency is well-established His leadership PAC recently brought on two respected Republican Party aides, and last month when he visited Iowa, the first state to hold a presidential election each cycle, he promised to come back.","The 2.5 percent reduction in funding would affect all of Wisconsin's 13 public universities, especially the University of Wisconsin- Madison .

"Imports of Rioja rose 10 per cent last year as more Britons switched to Spanish wine, a new report reveals. Shipments reached 36.2million litres in 2014 with experts predicting that total imports from the country will soon exceed those from neighbouring France. The UK accounted for one third of sales of wine from the Rioja region of northern Spain, according to figures from The Grocer, a trade magazine. Most of the growth came from the cheapest category of red – unaged. Imports of Rioja rose by 10 per cent last year with shipments reaching 36.2 million litres in the UK . The more expensive, and mature, crianza, riserva and gran riserva categories grew more modestly while exports of white and rosé Rioja fell. In contrast, the Spanish domestic market, which still accounts for 63 per cent of total Rioja sales, shifted towards white and aged reds. In the next two largest Rioja export markets, Germany and the US, volumes rose 2.2 per cent and fell 1.9 per cent respectively. Outside the UK, strong growth came from Mexico, up 27.9 per cent, and Russia, up 12.3 per cent, though each accounts for less than 3 per cent of total exports. The report said that Rioja exports have grown in nine of the past 11 years with 2008 and 2009 the exceptions. The rest of the wine industry has declined, amid predictions Spanish wines will soon enjoy a greater market share then their French rivals. Total exports of the wine, from the La Rioja region of northern Spain, reached a record 106million litres with the UK accounting for more than a third. Spanish domestic consumption was 175million litres bringing total sales to 281million litres. The UK accounted for one third of all sales of wine from the Rioja region of northern Spain (pictured above)","Imports of Rioja rose 10 per cent in 2014 as more Britons switched to wine .

Josie Edden fell over while she was crossing a road in Melbourne's central business district and was hit and killed by a garbage truck on Monday morning . Paramedics and a driver who witnessed the incident attended to Ms Edden for around 15 minutes but she died at the scene . Distraught friends and colleagues consoled one another at the scene after Ms Edden didn't turn up to work at the Code Black Coffee cafe. Work mate, Rita Hanna, described how surreal it was to discover the moment that all of Ms Edden's colleagues at the cafe realised the tragic accident was their dear friend. 'The crazy thing is we all walked past the scene in the morning, we were all running to work, we were all late because there were no trams,' she told News Corp. 'We all got to work, we were all talking about it. Then we found out the person that had passed away was one of ours and that was devastating news.' The 24-year-old was on her way to work, just two blocks from her apartment when she was struck at about 6.15am when walking across Collins Street near Southern Cross station . Sergeant Mark Rose said the truck driver, who is helping police with inquiries, would not have seen Ms Edden and did not appear to be at fault. 'It appears she was running, or walking very quickly ... has cut the corner against the flashing red man, tripped over, the truck's completed his turn, not seen her and ran her over,' he told reporters on Tuesday. Victoria Police acting chief commissioner Tim Cartwright said pedestrians, particularly in the city, are vulnerable which is why speed limits are lower. 'We know we have pedestrians, bike riders in the CBD who get injured,' he said. 'We know that every 10km off the speeds that we take off, that's a corresponding percentage who will survive collisions like this,' he said on ABC radio.

"Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, sparkled in a four-strand diamond necklace studded with rubies during an appearance at a London film premiere with Prince Charles. The Duchess cut a glamorous figure in her ruby velvet dress and diamond-studded parure, which, according to aides, was a personal gift to Camilla,  and includes a pair of drop earrings and a bracelet. Compared to his wife, the Prince of Wales looked rather more low key, although his dapper dinner suit was enlivened with one of his signature silk pocket squares. Scroll down for video . Chic: Camilla cut a glamorous figure in diamonds and velvet at the Leicester Square premiere . On their way: Prince Charles, in black tie, escorted the Duchess down the orange carpet in Leicester Square . Beautiful: Camilla dazzled onlookers with the intricate diamond parure. She kept her rings simple . The Duchess' floor-length gown was the work of Anna Valentine, the designer who created her dove-grey wedding dress, and was teamed with an organza shawl and shimmering purple clutch. The royal couple were joined by stars of the The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which was getting its premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square - which had been given an Indian-themed makeover for the event. Those in attendance included Dame Judi Dench, who, seemingly inspired by the film, wore a floral print flowing robe, and Dame Maggie Smith who opted for a more low-key black and beige ensemble. Also at the premiere was Myleene Klass who bared her shoulders in a black jumpsuit and actress Diana Hardcastle, who looked spectacular in a floor-length plum gown. Stunning: Charles, who has made eight official visits to India, looked impressed with the decoration . Dapper: Charles was on top sartorial form in a double-breasted dinner jacket and natty silk pocket square . Colourful: Charles's attention was grabbed by the colourful garlands looped over the cinema's entrance . Spectacular: Camilla's impressive jewels resembled a £1m set given to her by the Saudi royals . The premiere was staged by the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund, which uses the annual Royal Performance - usually a premiere - as its principal fundraising event. Charles. who has long been associated with the Fund, and Camilla joined the stars of the film on the orange carpet, which was decorated with tangerine, yellow and pink curtains, as well as long pink garlands. So captivating was the effect, Charles' attention was momentarily diverted from his magnificently attired wife and held by the floral decorations that marked the way into the cinema. Both looked delighted when, as they approached the entrance to the cinema, they were given a rousing cheer by film fans. But thanks to her striking necklace, all eyes were on the Duchess. Camilla is said to prefer rubies, a stone that is linked with romance and has a royal history, as a result of its use in coronation rings. Colourful: The couple were on cheerful form as they arrived for the annual Royal Film Performance . Enjoying a chat: The Duchess met Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund trustees and acting stars . Standing out: The royal couple looked relatively soberly dressed amid the spectacular garlands . The Duchess also possesses a diamond and ruby tiara given to her great-grandmother Alice Keppel by Edward VII. Made of gold and platinum, it is set with diamonds and, curiously, synthetic rubies, which were new and in high demand at the time. Striking though the Duchess' appearance was, she did have some competition in the shape of the cast of the film, which read like a Who's Who of British acting. Along with Bill Nighy, Celia Imrie, Penelope Wilton, Ronald Pickup, Diana Hardcastle and Tamsin Greig, Richard Gere also makes an appearance, as does Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel. Is that for us? Charles beamed when film fans applauded as he and Camilla made their way into the cinema . Still smiling: Charles, who is recently returned from the Middle East, looked thoroughly pleased . Elegant: Maggie and Judi showed the younger set how it's done at the  world premiere event . Supportive: Judi brought conservationist David Mills, her partner of over four years, as her date . Age is but a number! Glamorous Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith joked around on the red carpet . Glamorous: Like Judi, Celia Imrie chose a colourful ensemble for the premiere in London's Leicester Square . Dressed to impress: Celia struck a pose in her glamorous pink and orange ensemble . Terrific trio: The old friends enjoyed a gossip on the red carpet as they entered the cinema . The appearance came at the end of a busy day for Camilla, who had spent the morning visiting one of London's smallest galleries, the Fan Museum in Greenwich. She was making her fourth visit to the museum, which opened in 1991, and was there to inspect a new exhibition called Waterloo: Life and Times. Launched to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, the new exhibition features fans and fan leaves made to commemorate the Iron Duke's victory over Napoleon. Chic: Diana Hardcastle wrapped up in a chic emerald coat and plum-coloured dress . Proud partner: Thandie Newton accompanied her  husband Oliver Parker to the Royal Performance . Big night out: Thandie gushed about how handsome her 'hubster' looked on her Twitter account . What cold? Myleene Klass braved the London chill in a backless jumpsuit at the premiere . Her own best advertisement: Myleene looked beautiful in a design from her own Very range . Stunning: Actress Tina Desai was the belle of the ball in her glittering crop top and flowing skirt . Sharing the spotlight: Celia and Judi posed for pictures on the special orange carpet . Atmospheric: A troupe of dancers entertained the crowds before the cast arrived .

Stephanie Adams, 27, was left unable to get into her Vauxhall Corsa after this shocking piece of parking in Nottingham . The driver of the Audi A5 left the vehicle just millimetres from her white coloured Vauxhall Corsa . Stephanie said that she could not climb in through the passenger door because of her child's car seat . The driver of the Audi made sure they had plenty of space to get in and out of their vehicle on the drivers side. 'When I left the car there was a space next to it, but when I came back the car was parked like this,' said the 27-year-old, who was delayed collecting her daughter from nursery. 'My first thought was ''how am I going to get out?'' but then I thought ''how am I going to get in?'' 'The car was parked so close to my mine I couldn't get in, and I didn't think I'd be able to climb over the child seat which is in the passenger seat. 'But even if I did get into the car, I'm not sure I would have been able to reverse out of there anyway.' When the driver of the navy blue 2007 Audi A5 Sport TDI Quattro finally moved his car, there was no damage to her vehicle.

'Strangely enough I think I actually bumped into the driver who was having trouble with his ticket at the machine,' said the photography student. 'He was about 25 and wearing a suit. He looked a bit flash but I let him go ahead of me because I was waiting for an attendant so I could show him how the Audi had parked. 'When the attendant arrived we went up the stairs to my car and the Audi had gone. The only person I had seen was the guy in the suit so I assume it must have been his car.

In a recent interview with the New York Times she described her design process: 'When I’m starting work on the collection, I just sit with my team and talk to them about what I like, what I find inspiring, what I’m desiring, what I want to wear, what I haven’t done before. 'We have fit models we work with, and we’ll either work the fit model or we’ll drape on a stand. I can draw, but badly. I think that’s okay. No one’s expecting me to do it the normal way. 'And that’s a good thing. But I do sometimes take all my clothes off and drape on myself. It’s just a bit more pleasant for everybody if we do it on models.' But while we were once accustomed to seeing Victoria strutting down to Nobu in a tiny Herve Leger dress and Jimmy Choos, these days, Mrs Beckham champions body-covering, not body-con outfits. Victoria's chunky knits and midi skirt ensembles that barely revealed an inch of flesh have been hailed as 'the new kind of sexy' Victoria's family (L-R) Romeo, Brooklyn, Cruz , David and Harper sat by Anna Wintour on the front row. 'This was a sexy and sophisticated take that put shape at its centre for soft and womanly silhouettes,' wrote Vogue's Jessica Bumpus. Victoria Beckham turtleneck sweater .

She told The Independent: 'I'm busier now - so I couldn't totter around in a tight dress and a pair of heels. I think I feel a little more relaxed.' Mrs Beckham, admits that she was too afraid to dress down in the past. She explained: 'I suppose if I'm being honest, I would have been scared, right at the beginning, to wear lots of layers and to wear a flat shoe. Now I'm not.' She now favours a muted colour palette of mostly blacks, greys and sometimes white, as well as flats, and she almost exclusively wears her own designs. Mrs Beckham has made the transition to globally respected fashion designer, silencing her critics  by launching a hugely successful brand loved by A-listers and fashion editors alike. She unveiled her AW15 collection at New York Fashion Week on Sunday to a stellar front row, including husband David and their sons Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and daughter Harper, three, sitting alongside Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, and stylist Rachel Zoe. Shunning the trend for overexposure, currently championed by the likes of Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus and Miranda Kerr, Victoria's range was a much more modest affair. Her designs were full of cream midi skirts, voluminous knits and calf-scraping culottes - proving that more really is more. The entire collection went down a storm with Vogue's most esteemed fashion editors. Last year,  the fashion bible hinted that Victoria's collection was reminiscent of the stuff they had seen on the Celine runway  before and commented that they'd like to see a 'bit more of her' in her designs. It seems she took note. With a new direction, 40-year-old Victoria's stand-out designs, which are clearly based on her own wardrobe, winning her plaudits. Shunning the trend for overexposure loved on all the red carpets, Victoria's sophisticated and feminine collection still won plaudits . Victoria seen on the front tow of a fashion week show in 2008 making notes...how things have changed . Legendary Vogue International Editor, Suzy Menkes OBE, added: 'Bringing back sexy - a slither of flesh at the waist or a jigsaw of fabrics forming five shades of black - was only a sidebar to the main story: Victoria Beckham has made it as a designer. 'I can’t think of another celebrity who has been willing and able to create a unique style.' The doyenne of style journalism also added: 'Whatever fashion people say about “Team VB” doing all the work, I believe that the foundation and flow of this collection could have come only from her.' In her show notes, Mrs Beckham explained 'it is not about one theme - but instead thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel.' The creative process for this collection was an altogether different style. Mrs Beckham explains how she decided to start with her classic designs and re-imagine them for a new season. 'I began with the dress and looked at evolving and translating it,' she wrote. 'It was from here that the collection and its narrative developed and it has been liberating and surprising for me in terms of the creative process. 'Familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked. Volumes have been subverted, menswear elements re-engineered to fit the female form and twists, spirals, seams and asymmetry interplayed. Fabrics bounce and move, a swing is sculptural, and a more body conscious silhouette emerges... 'For me it is a collection full of possibilities.' Victoria Beckham seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this collection, with patent boots and luxurious coats . Mrs Beckham explained that she had been thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel . Commenting on her range, The Telegraph's Ellie Pithers wrote: 'Equally successful were the mannish double-breasted navy cocoon coats with neat horn buttons; the herringbone coat with a bustle at the hip; the chunky cream and navy sweaters with ballooning sleeves; and the skirt made out of cream velvet bows - VB's answer to the ""modern day red carpet"" conundrum when worn with a simple chenille sweater. 'Sure, it's not a problem that vexes most of us, but she's got all her bases covered.' Fashion website WWD described the collection as 'a study in calm sexiness' and insisted plenty of women will be climbing over each other to wear it come autumn. This is the latest in a string of stylish hits for the star, who last year opened the doors to her flagship store on Dover Street. Then, she beat fashion powerhouse Alexander McQueen, a label loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, as well as her friend Stella McCartney for the prestigious title of Best Brand at the British Fashion Awards 2014. Victoria, pictured in Los Angeles in 2007, once favoured figure-hugging dresses and pointy stilettos but she's relaxed her approach to dressing and has adopted a much more pared-back and fashionable approach to getting dressed in the morning .","Victoria Beckham, 40, has 'a different way' of expressing herself .

"TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp accused Argos of allowing rubbish to pile up outside its online depot . She has waged war on litter bugs by naming and shaming them through a string of furious Twitter posts. Yesterday Kirstie Allsopp added Argos to her hit list by accusing the retailer of allowing rubbish to pile up outside its online depot. Yesterday Miss Allsopp, 43, shared an image of the discarded waste with her 371,000 followers. It was a snap one of her followers had sent her. And the TV presenter wrote: 'Shame on Argos '@mymbletroll: This is the usual litter outside the @Argos_Online depot'.' The photograph showed what looked like packaging and plastic bags strewn through trees and undergrowth outside Argos' depot. The red of a delivery lorry could be made out in the background. And in a string of messages Miss Allsopp explained her anger, writing: 'Everyone has a duty to clear litter, and companies should know that a littered area nearby reflects badly on them.' Some of her followers defended Argos, drawing to Miss Allsopp's attention the retailer's track record for recycling. It's catalogue is 100 per cent recyclable and it has in the past asked customers to help it cut down on plastic bag usage by 60 per cent. But Miss Allsopp replied: 'Recycling is great, but everyone has to be responsible for the space around them, businesses included.' Miss Allsopp's war on litter bugs began last year when she started exposing the worst offenders. Abandoned dog mess particularly infuriates Miss Allsopp, who is an ambassador for Keep Britain Tidy, and she backs fining litter louts. In recent weeks she has shared an article about a 'super rat' found in a man's house, writing it was evidence of 'why litter matters'. She also retweeted a post from Victoria Beckham which said 'no gum allowed,' next to an image of discarded chewing gum stuck to the sole of a shoe. And last month the Location Location Location star, who has two sons with her partner Ben Andersen, shamed one culprit who dropped rubbish out his car window, labelling him a 't*****'. It was in reference to the 'Don't be a T****r' campaign which has been used by local councils and Keep Britain Tidy to encourage people to be more responsible when disposing of their waste. She shared an image of the discarded waste with her 371,000 followers and said: 'Shame on Argos' Miss Allsopp wrote: 'The driver of this car RJ61 EWK is a tosser #teachersnottossers @KeepBritainTidy' alongside a picture of a red car taken in the dark.' In the past Miss Allsopp has said of the campaign: 'For me it's a brilliant slogan because it really sums up how terrible it is to chuck stuff out of cars. If each of us chucked a piece of litter out of our car every day we would be knee deep within weeks.' Last night a spokesman for Argos said it was 'looking into' the Tweet. The spokesman added: 'Our twitter team are trying to make contact with the person who originally shared the image.'","Kirstie Allsopp accused Argos of  allowing rubbish to pile up outside depot .

"A British NHS worker was yesterday evacuated back to the UK amid fears she had contracted Ebola after being splashed with a patient's bodily fluids in Sierra Leone. The female health worker was lying on a stretcher by a Swiss Air rescue plane covered in an insulating sheet surrounded by staff in protective suits and masks. The woman is the third Briton to be evacuated from Sierra Leone by an ATI (Air Transport Insulator) after she was splashed with what is believed to be bodily fluids from a victim. Evacuation: The British Red Cross worker was flown home after being splashed with the bodily fluids of an Ebola patient in Sierra Leone. Pictured: A worker being hosed down with disinfectant . The woman, who was working for the British Red Cross, was splashed with what was believed to be a bodily fluid feared to belong to an Ebola victim on Saturday. She was taking off her personnel protective equipment (PPE) when the fluid came into contact with her eyes. She is being taken back to the UK as a precaution, though she was yesterday deemed to be ‘low risk’. The woman, who has not been named, was working at a treatment centre in Kono and was transported 90 miles across the country to Kerry Town treatment centre. Then this morning she was moved to the international airport by the military. It is not known whether she will be treated at the Royal Free in London. As the incident happened on Saturday and it was over 48 hours later, it was feared she could spread the virus to others. Public Health England (PHE) confirmed it was 'a highly precautionary measure'. The woman has no symptoms, and will be monitored for the next 21 days to ensure she does not have the disease. Professor Paul Cosford, PHE’s director for health protection and medical director, said: 'We are confident that all appropriate public health actions have been, and will continue to be, taken to support this individual and to protect the public’s health.' Deadly: This woman, giving advice to local women, is one of the few survivors of the disease . Yesterday a patient was admitted to hospital in Edinburgh after recently returning from west Africa, They were admitted to the regional infectious diseases unit at the Western General Hospital earlier on Monday. Will Pooley, a volunteer nurse, contracted the deadly virus in August and was flown back to the UK by an ATI. British nurse Pauline Cafferkey was treated in a London hospital after contracting Ebola in the country but she recovered. She was diagnosed with Ebola following her return to Glasgow from Sierra Leone where she had a volunteer with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town. And a Northern Irish nurse was transported by a medical plane from Sierra Leone a few weeks ago amid fears she had Ebola but she was given the all clear. In Sierra Leone so far 3,341 people have died from the deadly virus, and there has been nearly 11,000 cases. Survivors: Nurses Will Pooley and Pauline Cafferkey both contracted the deadly disease, but survived . Meanwhile, Michael Fallon stepped onto the runway at Lungi airport, near Freetown, yesterday morning -  as the patient was being prepared to be flown out. Speaking before meeting the President of Sierra Leone Ernest Bai Coroma on an official visit, Mr Fallon hailed the armed forces’ work in the region, where there are currently around 700 soldiers deployed. He said: ‘We are one of only two countries that could do what we are doing in terms of deployments because we have got adaptable, deployable forces. ‘Look at our reputation in the world. Look at the respect at which our Armed Forces have. We have 90,000 forces in 50 different countries.’ Asked if the UK’s role across the world was diminishing, he added: ‘Our global reach if anything is bigger than what it was 30 years ago. We are doing lots of things across the world.’","The aid worker was evacuated yesterday on a Swiss Air rescue plane .

A cyclone warning has been declared for the coastal and island communities of the eastern Top End . If it stays over water for another few days, it could strengthen to a category three or four storm. The Northern Territory's Emergency Management Committee will meet on Tuesday, said Commander Bruce Porter, Region 2 Regional Controller from the NT Police, Fire, and Emergency Services. He said local emergency plans have been activated and authorities are well prepared. He advised communities on cyclone watch to put together emergency kits, clear their yards and begin preparing their home shelters. They should have at least three litres of water per person per day for at least 72 hours, as well as filling up vehicles' fuel tanks, and any available jerry cans. Tropical Cyclone Lam is moving towards the coast, with a warning extending from Nhulunbuy to Cape Shield . 'Check that your friends, family and neighbours have heard and understood the messages, particularly new arrivals or those who may not fully understand English,' Commander Porter said in a statement. No one should proceed to emergency shelters until advised by authorities. 'If you do not have accommodation constructed to the building code or are unsure of your present accommodation, you should determine now where you will shelter,' he said. 'This may include arranging to shelter with family, friends or in public emergency shelters, or strong buildings, where available in your community.'","Cyclone warning for the coastal communities of the eastern Top End .

"Tavaris Reevey, 41, was charged with child endangerment after his son, 4, crashed the family's car into a brick wall while left unattended . A New Jersey father who left his children alone in his car has been charged with child endangerment after his four-year-old son crashed the family's vehicle into a brick wall. Tavaris Reevey, 41, left his son and two-year-old daughter unattended in a running car. That's when his four-year-old climbed into the driver's seat and put the car in reverse, backing the vehicle across the parking lot before it struck a brick wall. Neither of the children were injured in the crash, according to NJ.com. The accident occurred at the Middlebrook Apartment complex in Ocean Township. Reevey was arrested yesterday at the scene and has since been released. After the incident, police also learned there was a $250 contempt of court warrant issued for Reevey. Future court hearings were planned for both the child endangerment charges and the active warrant. New Jersey Department of Child Protection and Permanency were also notified and Reevey's two children were put in the care of their mother. Reevey's two-year-old daughter was also in the running car.

"Tragic: Mexican telenovela actress Lorena Rojas, pictured here in 2008, died on Monday . Mexican telenovela actress Lorena Rojas has died after a long battle with cancer. Rojas, 44, died on Monday at her Miami home surrounded by her family, boyfriend Jorge Monje and friends. The actress had been battling breast cancer since 2008. Her last message to her fans was sent on social media site Twitter less than a week ago, on her 44th birthday. 'Thank you all for celebrating my birthday with me. Beautiful day,' she tweeted. Rojas began her career in 1990 with the telenovela 'Alcanzar Una Estrella,' produced by Televisa. She went on to star in more than a dozen Latin soap operas, including 'El Cuerpo del Deseo,'  and, most recently, 'Rosario,' according to CNN. The Latin star adopted a daughter called Luciana in October 2013. She became inspired by her daughter to work as a singer songwriter on a children's album, 'Hijos del Sol' last year. Rojas was initially diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 but made a recovery. In 2012, she was told that her cancer had metastasized in her bones, according to The Latin Times. The following year Rojas told Mexican state news Agency Notimex that '[she] was very aware that this disease... is a chronic disease.' Last year the tumor spread to her liver.

"They may look like a completely alien species in our eyes, but new research suggests that our brains share a surprising link with sea anemones and jellyfish. Scientists have discovered a key evolutionary spurt that allowed animals to develop complex brains occurred in a common ancestor we share with the brightly coloured sea creatures. Biologists have found genes responsible for enabling electrical communication between nerve cells first occurred 600 million years ago. Scroll down for video . The human brain shares a surprising evolutionary history with sea anemones like those pictured above . The evolutionary innovation enabled neurons to form complex networks and led to the development of our brains. While humans have been around for about 2.5 million years, the beating of our hearts is controlled by something much older. Scientists have uncovered an ancient molecular pathway that they believe may be between 700 million to a billion years old. The discovery was made after researchers in Pennsylvania studied the evolution of the nervous and muscular systems of a starlet sea anemone. They found that the genes responsible for the movement of sea anemones belongs to the same family that triggers slow-wave contractions of the human heart. After cloning the genes, the researchers found that its function remained relatively unchanged since the time of humans' and cnidarians' divergence from their common ancestor almost a billion years ago. The scientists have traced the origins of these genes to an ancient form of sea life that both humans, sea anemones and jellyfish are descended from. In jellyfish and sea anemones the genes allow the creatures to move and sense their surroundings. Faults in these genes in humans are also known to cause epilepsy and other neurological diseases. The biologists behind the new research hope that their findings can be used to help better understand how these diseases occur. Dr Timothy Jegla, who led the work at Penn State University, said: 'We had always assumed that we would be able to trace most of these signaling systems to the earliest nervous systems, but in this paper we show that this is not the case. 'It looks like the majority of these signaling systems first appear in the common ancestor that humans share with jellyfish and sea anemones. 'Humans and sea anemones went their separate ways evolutionary speaking roughly 600 million years ago, so we know that the mechanisms we use to generate impulses in our neurons must be at least that old.' Our neurons use tiny proteins known as ion-channels that form openings in the cell membranes to allow charged particles such as potassium to flow in and out. Comb jellies like those pictured above, have the most basic nervous system in animals today that is very different from our own suggesting ion channels developed after they split from sea anemones and jellyfish . These then trigger waves of electrical impulses to flow through the nerve cells. Ion-channels are now found in almost all living organisms and are crucial to allow neurons to coordinate themselves and develop complex networks. Sea anemones have nervous systems that allow them to coordinate movement and respond to their surroundings, but do not have a brain or any other analogous organs. Recent genome sequences from comb jellies - another marine organism that also has a nervous system - has shown that they do not have the same kind of channels. It suggests that the ion channels we now use evolved after the cnidarians, which include jelly fish, coral and sea anemones, separated from the ctenophora like comb jellies. Dr Jegla said that the genes for potassium ion channels are thought to have occurred instead in an branch of the animal evolutionary tree known as parahoxozoa. He said: 'It appears that animals such as sea anemones and jellyfish are using the same channels that shape electrical signals in our brains in essentially the same way. Sea anemone polyps like the one above has a surprising evolutionary link to our own complex brains . 'We don't yet understand why our ion channels evolved at that time, but the changes in the ability of nerve cells to generate electrical signals must have been revolutionary. 'Our current favorite hypothesis is that neurons capable of directional signaling might have evolved at this time. In human nervous systems, most nerve cells have a polar structure with separate regions for inputs and outputs. This allows for directional information flow and highly complex circuits of nerve cells, but it requires a huge diversity of ion channels to shape the electrical signals as they pass through the polar nerve cells. Dr Jegla said that the research could help provide new insights into studying human diseases. He said: 'One of the major limitations on our ability to understand the relationship between human ion channel mutations and disease, is that we actually don’t know enough about the unique role many ion channels play in neuronal signaling. 'It is hard to know what to fix if you don’t know what is broken. 'In our evolutionary studies, we are trying to get at the very reason why we have these potassium channels in the first place, and we hope that will give us some important new insights into their functional roles in neuronal signaling.'","Penn State University scientists traced the evolution of genes in neurons .

"They are a stunning insight into an almost alien world. Now researchers have unveiled incredible new images which reveal the smooth underside of icebergs. The stunning patterns reveal centuries of material from the Earth's oceans. Scroll down for video . Large old icebergs contain centuries of windblown sediment and minerals, visible as layers when they roll over. Salt water is much denser than fresh water, causing icebergs to float. As they melt in the ocean, their weight distribution can change, causing some icebergs to flip over completely. However, this is an extremely rare occurrence as 90 per cent of any iceberg is below the surface, meaning the balance is rarely in favour of a complete flip. The images, from the U.S. Antarctic Program, show an overturned iceberg with some penguins on top. 'It contains centuries of windblown sediments and minerals,' said Nasa, which published the images. 'It really is the stuff of dreams.' The pictures were taken in Iceberg Alley, a region in the western Weddell Sea where a large concentration of icebergs move in a north-northeast direction following the clockwise circulation around the Weddell Sea gyre. Large old icebergs contain centuries of windblown sediment and minerals, visible as layers when they roll over. Scientists have analysed the relationship between iron and nutrients contained in these icebergs and the organic carbon production that is released into the ecosystem. Salt water is much denser than fresh water, causing icebergs to float. As they melt in the ocean, their weight distribution can change, causing some icebergs to flip over completely. However, this is an extremely rare occurrence as 90 per cent of any iceberg is below the surface, meaning the balance is rarely in favour of a complete flip. When a flip does occur, the consequences can be devastating. For instance, larger iceberg flips can trigger tsunamis that can damage nearby ships. Their undersides can vary in colour from blue to green, and they will stay that colour for the rest of their lives. It is such a stunning colour because ice absorbs red light, and reflects blue.

The pictures were taken in Iceberg Alley, a region in the western Weddell Sea. Not all icebergs are white: This photograph by Alex Cornell proves that their undersides can come in spectacular shades of colours . Last month while on an expedition to Antarctica, Alex Cornell was stunned when he spotted an 'alien' blue iceberg floating across the landscape. Unlike the icebergs around it, the surreal sleeping beast was completely free of snow and debris, revealing a polished azure surface. What Mr Cornell witnessed in Drake Passage was an incredibly rare phenomenon; a flipped iceberg caused by an imbalance in frozen water. 'Antarctica is one of those places where you can point the camera in any direction and come away with something spectacular,' Mr Cornell told Fstoppers. 'Typically icebergs are white, with blue accents near the water - this by contrast was alien-blue. More like a galactic artefact than anything terrestrial.' The San Francisco-based photographer added that the glacier was likely to be extremely old, with the blue being 'the glacial equivalent of aging white hairs.' Experts say the iceberg could be anything from tens to hundreds of thousands of years in age.

"With their loud shouts of ‘Oh no it isn’t!’, pantomimes have always had a proud tradition of audience participation. But one amateur production suffered more than its fair share of boos and hisses – when a rival group turned up to heckle the performance. Their jeers were so distracting it caused cast members to stumble over their lines and terrified a number of children on stage, leading organisers to brand it ‘sabotage’. Members of the Chard Amateur Theatre Society (pictured during the dress rehearsal for their performance of Aladdin) were said to have stumbled over their lines and been 'left terrified' by the jeers from their rivals . Chard Amateur Theatre Society (CATS) had performed a successful run of Aladdin and was looking forward to a triumphant last night. But members claimed their final performance was ruined when several people of the rival Tatworth Amateur Pantomime Society (TAPS) turned up at the show in Guildhall in Chard, Somerset. Organisers last night said the unwelcome guests were once part of CATS but left because they did not get the parts they wanted. One anonymous audience member said the evening was ‘ruined’ by the uninvited interruption, adding: ‘Now, there is crowd participation, which every pantomime should strive to encourage, but this was clearly interference and sabotage. ‘A number of the CATS cast were singled out for special treatment and the hecklers became louder and louder until these cast members became visibly nervous and began to make mistakes. 'At this point the feeling of victory from the hecklers was palpable as they jeered and laughed out loud, and a number of children in the cast left the stage terrified after performing.’ CATS leader Lorraine Marshall said there would be no tit-for-tat retaliation. She said: ‘Every panto wants booing and hissing and that sort of stuff but this was over the top. Cast members from Tatworth Amateur Pantomime Society (pictured) admitted heckling the performance at the Guildhall in Chard, Somerset, but said it was 'just a little bit of banter' and said the group 'took offence' The incident occurred during Chard Amateur Theatre Society's final performance of Aladdin (above), subject of a hit 1992 Disney film . ‘A few of them used to be part of our cast and didn’t get the parts they wanted, and they have got quite nasty about it. It’s very disappointing. ‘I felt very sorry for the cast and members of the audience because people have said to me that it ruined their night.’ TAPS insisted it was just ‘a bit of banter’. Secretary Sheila Harding added: ‘It wasn’t anything different to what others might do at a performance where people know one another. ‘Some of our members gave a little bit of banter and they took offence. 'We go to many local pantos, not just Chard, and it is all just part and parcel of it. It’s part of the banter between groups. ‘Maybe we might have been a fraction too loud but we are expecting them to retaliate at our performance.’","Chard Amateur Theatre Society put on pantomime performance of Aladdin .

"A report into the management of the NHS that is said to be damning is being sat on by ministers, it was claimed last night. Former Marks & Spencer boss Stuart Rose was asked a year ago by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to assess how NHS hospitals could keep ‘the very best leaders to help transform the culture in underperforming hospitals’. He handed his report to ministers on time at the end of last year, but it has not been given a publication date, according to the Financial Times. Scroll down for video . Former Marks & Spencer boss Stuart Rose (left) was asked a year ago by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) to assess how NHS hospitals could keep ‘the very best leaders to help transform culture in hospitals’ Last night, Labour said the report’s non-appearance showed government claims of transparency were ‘hollow’. Launching the Rose Review in February, Mr Hunt described Lord Rose as ‘one of the country’s most inspirational leaders’ and said his report could play a significant role in stopping hospitals failing in the future. Mr Hunt added: ‘The difference between good and bad care can often lie in leadership.’ The Financial Times said last night that Lord Rose’s report – which is said to have described the overall standard of much NHS management as ‘totally shocking’ – had been handed to the Department of Health in December. Despite ministers receiving it, the paper claimed that no publication date has been set. One individual who has been in meetings where the report was discussed said it had been put on ‘the back burner’. Lord Rose, now chairman of online supermarket Ocado, has concluded that mediocre managers are allowed to move from job to job without being held to account. The retail chief credited with turning around the fortunes of M&S is concerned that NHS managers – lacking the same control over pay and conditions as private sector counterparts – too often rely on top-down diktats to drive performance, according to a source with whom he discussed the report. The NHS has been Labour’s spearhead policy which it has championed in its bid to win May’s general election. But criticism of its track record in Wales, where Labour controls the NHS, has called the party’s ability to run the health service into question. Former M&S boss Lord Rose (above), who is now chairman of online supermarket Ocado, was described by Mr Hunt as ‘one of the country’s most inspirational leaders’ and said his report could play a significant role . For this reason Conservative strategists will be anxious to avoid criticism of their own record with the NHS. Lynton Crosby, David Cameron’s election adviser, has emphasised that nothing should detract from the Tories’ focus on their economic record. Criticism of NHS management is a thorny issue for the coalition after contentious reforms were implemented almost two years ago in an attempt to make the NHS more efficient. The changes were designed to simplify management structures and hand power to clinicians. However the measures were recently branded by the King’s Fund, a respected think tank, as an expensive distraction from the real problems facing the service, and the result had been a lack of ‘system leadership’. Negative comments from a private sector leader could be particularly sensitive given opposition claims that the Government is seeking to privatise the NHS – even though Lord Rose’s remit specifically precluded consideration of a bigger role for private sector companies. The Department of Health said: ‘We will be publishing the report in due course.’ Ed Miliband has been accused of misleading voters after Labour sent out letters made to look like they were from a hospital or GP surgery. Many were left upset by the mail, which could easily be mistaken for test results or notification of changes in local NHS provision. The letters come in envelopes saying that they contain important information about the NHS. It is only when people read the contents that they realise it is a message from the Labour leader. Mr Miliband has been condemned as ‘cruel’ and ‘insensitive’ after the letters were received by hospital patients, the elderly and families of the recently deceased. Opponents accused him of scare tactics and say it is further evidence of his campaign to ‘weaponise’ the NHS ahead of the general election. In the letter, Mr Miliband writes about the ‘challenges facing your local hospital’ and warns that ‘services here are struggling’. Despite the claim that it concerns the future of ‘local NHS services’, exactly the same message is being sent to homes across the country. Misleading?: Across the top of the envelope is the message: ‘Important information about the future of local NHS services' and recipients only find out the letter's true message once they have opened it .","'Damning' report into management of NHS said to be sat on by ministers .

"Outspoken Independent Senator Jacqui Lambie wants an overhaul of the Australian citizenship oath, to include renouncing of Sharia Law and in, arguably, her most controversial call yet, she wants the death penalty reintroduced. Capital punishment officially ended in Australia in 1984, when revoked by Western Australia but had not been used after 1967 when Ronald Ryan was sentenced to death by hanging in 1967. But as debate rages over Indonesia's use of the ultimate punishment on convicted Australian drug-smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, Ms Lambie insists treason against this country should be punished in the most severe fashion. Scroll down for video . Outspoken Independent Senator Jacqui Lambie wants an overhaul of the Australian citizenship oath, to include renouncing of Sharia Law and in, arguably, her most controversial call yet, she wants the death penalty reintroduced . Teenage defector Abdullah Elmir, from Bankstown in south-western Sydney, is among who has taken up arms for terror groups and would be one of those who could be considered guilty of treason under Senator Lambie's plan . Ms Lambie wants treason charges laid against all ex-Australians who have taken up arms with terror groups such as ISIS . 'It’s time we adopted a much tougher approach to people who are Australian citizens and have fought or are now fighting alongside our enemies, or assisting them,' she said. 'In those cases the Australian laws are very clear. Australian citizens who take up arms against members of our ADF (Australian Defence Force) are guilty of treason. Strangely no Australian politician, including Mr Abbott, has been able to explain why the most serious of federal charges - treason or sedition, has not been laid against the hundreds of Australian citizens who have joined the fight with ISIS or are assisting them back home in Australia. I want to know why?' Senator Lambie asked. The Senator has urged Prime Minister Tony Abbott to overhaul laws to take tougher action against would-be terrorists in Australia . The one-time Palmer United Party politician believes revoking citizenship or trying to rehabilitate ISIS fighters returning to Australia is a waste of time, and dangerous. 'Part of my solution to help defeat ISIS is to re-introduce the death penalty as a sentencing option for Australian juries who find our citizens guilty of treason,' she said, explaining that would be categorised by taking up arms against Australian military personnel. 'Putting terrorists and would-be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for Islamic extremism. 'We need to get rid of them permanently. Mr Abbott needs to support the reintroduction of the death penalty for treason and terrorism.' Ms Lambie also insists that Islamic State supporters in Australia found to have any sort of link to the militant groups across Syria and Iraq, should immediately have their rights as an Australian citizen revoked. Under Australian law currently; citizenship can be removed ""if a person commits a ‘serious crime’ at any time prior to the person becoming an Australian citizen, provided they are convicted for 12 months or more for that crime. However, this applies only to applications for Australian citizenship by conferral, not to those who acquired Australian citizenship automatically. However, revocation cannot occur if (it) would render a citizen stateless (without nationality)."" Ms Lambie also insists that Islamic State supporters in Australia found to have any sort of link to the militant groups across Syria and Iraq, should immediately have their rights as an Australian citizen revoked. 'Putting terrorists and would-be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for Islamic extremism.'We need to get rid of them permanently. Mr Abbott needs to support the reintroduction of the death penalty for treason and terrorism,' Jacqui Lambie said . 'Our citizenship oath should clearly state that anyone wanting to become an Australia citizen is opposed to Sharia Law, a theocratic, anti-democratic law which strips women and gay people of basic human rights,' according to Senator Jacqui Lambie . 'At the very least, they should not be allowed to vote, stand for parliament or receive any government benefits until an official investigation establishes that they have not assisted our enemies in any way,' she added. 'If they are found to have assisted our enemies they must be charged with Sedition and put in jail for up to 7 years. 'She went further, calling for an overhaul of the Australian citizenship oath. 'Our enemies in ISIS want to impose Sharia Law on us and the rest of the world,' Senator Lambie said. 'Our citizenship oath should clearly state that anyone wanting to become an Australia citizen is opposed to Sharia Law, a theocratic, anti-democratic law which strips women and gay people of basic human rights.' The Senator's preferred version of the new oath, reads: 'From this time forward, under God, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights, liberties and opposition to Sharia Law I respect and whose laws I will uphold and obey.' She went on to claim that 'if immigrants, refugees or other prospective Australian citizens have a problem with swearing an oath to oppose Sharia Law, then they can leave Australia, and go to a country which does tolerate an anti-democratic law and culture - that the Islamic State terrorists want to impose on us by force'. 'It’s clear cut, from now on, it’s 100 per cent the Australian way or the highway,' said Senator Lambie.","Jacqui Lambie has called for the death penalty to be reintroduced in Australia for acts of treason .

The Moscow-based security software maker Kaspersky Lab said it has found personal computers in 30 countries . infected with one or more of the spying programs, with the most . infections seen in Iran, followed by Russia, Pakistan, . Afghanistan, China, Mali, Syria, Yemen and Algeria. The targets . included government and military institutions, telecommunication . companies, banks, energy companies, nuclear researchers, media, . and Islamic activists. Scroll down for video . Kaspersky said it found personal computers in 30 countries infected with one or more of the spying programs . The NSA has figured out how to hide spying software deep within hard drives , giving the agency the means to eavesdrop on the majority of the world's computers, according to Kaspersky (file photo) The NSA began infecting computers in 2001 claims Kaspersky, ramping up their efforts in 2008 when President Barack Obama was elected. This 'surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques, and that has been active for almost two decades,' said Kaspersky. What's more, even the makers of these hard drives are unaware that these spying programs have been installed, with the NSA obtaining their source codes by going so far as to pose as software developers according to former intelligence operatives, or telling the companies the government must do a security audit to make sure their source code is safe. According to Kaspersky, the spies made a technological . breakthrough by figuring out how to lodge malicious software in . the obscure code called firmware that launches every time a . computer is turned on. Disk drive firmware is viewed by spies and cybersecurity . experts as the second-most valuable real estate on a PC for a . hacker, second only to the BIOS code invoked automatically as a . computer boots up. 'The hardware will be able to infect the computer over and . over,' lead Kaspersky researcher Costin Raiu said in an . interview. Though the leaders of the still-active espionage campaign . could have taken control of thousands of PCs, giving them the . ability to steal files or eavesdrop on anything they wanted, the . spies were selective and only established full remote control . over machines belonging to the most desirable foreign targets, . according to Raiu. He said Kaspersky found only a few especially . high-value computers with the hard-drive infections. The firm declined to publicly name the country behind the . spying campaign, but said it was closely linked to Stuxnet, the . NSA-led cyberweapon that was used to attack Iran's uranium . enrichment facility. The NSA is the U.S. agency responsible for . gathering electronic intelligence. A former NSA employee told Reuters that Kaspersky's analysis . was correct, and that people still in the spy agency valued . these espionage programs as highly as Stuxnet. Another former . intelligence operative confirmed that the NSA had developed the . prized technique of concealing spyware in hard drives, but said . he did not know which spy efforts relied on it. NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said the agency was aware of the . Kaspersky report but would not comment on it publicly. Kaspersky published the technical details of its research on Monday, a move that could help infected institutions . detect the spying programs, some of which trace back as far as . 2001. Eugene Kaspersky (file photo) published the details of his research on Friday . The disclosure could hurt the NSA's surveillance abilities, . already damaged by massive leaks by former contractor Edward . Snowden. Snowden's revelations have upset some U.S. allies and . slowed the sales of U.S. technology products abroad. The exposure of these new spying tools could lead to greater . backlash against Western technology, particularly in countries . such as China, which is already drafting regulations that would . require most bank technology suppliers to proffer copies of . their software code for inspection. Peter Swire, one of five members of U.S. President Barack . Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications . Technology, said the Kaspersky report showed that it is . essential for the country to consider the possible impact on . trade and diplomatic relations before deciding to use its . knowledge of software flaws for intelligence gathering. 'There can be serious negative effects on other U.S. interests,' Swire said. Technological breakthrough . Kaspersky's reconstructions of the spying programs show that . they could work in disk drives sold by more than a dozen . companies, comprising essentially the entire market. They . include Western Digital Corp, Seagate Technology Plc, Toshiba Corp, IBM, Micron Technology . Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Western Digital, Seagate and Micron said they had no . knowledge of these spying programs. Toshiba and Samsung declined . to comment. IBM did not respond to requests for comment. Getting the source code . Raiu said the authors of the spying programs must have had . access to the proprietary source code that directs the actions . of the hard drives. That code can serve as a roadmap to . vulnerabilities, allowing those who study it to launch attacks . much more easily. 'There is zero chance that someone could rewrite the [hard . drive] operating system using public information,' Raiu said. Concerns about access to source code flared after a series . of high-profile cyberattacks on Google Inc and other . U.S. companies in 2009 that were blamed on China. Investigators . have said they found evidence that the hackers gained access to . source code from several big U.S. tech and defense companies. It is not clear how the NSA may have obtained the hard . drives' source code. Western Digital spokesman Steve Shattuck . said the company 'has not provided its source code to government . agencies.' The other hard drive makers would not say if they had . shared their source code with the NSA. Seagate spokesman Clive Over said it has 'secure measures to . prevent tampering or reverse engineering of its firmware and . other technologies.' Micron spokesman Daniel Francisco said the . company took the security of its products seriously and 'we are . not aware of any instances of foreign code.' According to former intelligence operatives, the NSA has multiple ways of obtaining source code from tech companies,including asking directly and posing as a software developer .

'It's usually the NSA doing the evaluation, and it's a . pretty small leap to say they're going to keep that source . code.' The NSA declined to comment on any allegations in the . Kaspersky report. Vines said the agency complies with the law . and White House directives to protect the United States and its . allies 'from a wide array of serious threats.' Kaspersky called the authors of the spying program 'the . Equation group,' named after their embrace of complex encryption . formulas. The group used a variety of means to spread other spying . programs, such as by compromising jihadist websites, infecting . USB sticks and CDs, and developing a self-spreading computer . worm called Fanny, Kaspersky said. Fanny was like Stuxnet in that it exploited two of the same . undisclosed software flaws, known as 'zero days,' which strongly . suggested collaboration by the authors, Raiu said.

Scroll down for video . Stuck in a lift: Karen Danczuk, the wife of Labour MP Simon, has described the moment Ed Miliband 'didn't know where to look' when she wore a low-cut top . 'For some reason Ed and I kept bumping into each other in the lift. It must have been a dozen times,' she told The Sun. 'The first few times I was dressed in a suit. But finally I was dressed up for the evening and was wearing a low-cut top. It was really awkward. 'We all try not to stare in those situations and Ed was no different. We were in a very small space together and he didn't know where to look.' The 31-year-old Labour supporter says the party's leader is failing to connect with working class voters because he does not 'speak their language'. She said:'If Ed Miliband says, ""We need to cut the deficit,"" what does that mean to people on a council estate? 'We need to be screaming about immigration. The NHS is important but you knock on doors and immigration is bigger. Ukip are doing well because they scream about immigration'. She added: 'God forbid the working class party should actually have someone working class to represent us'. Mrs Danczuk also said Mr Miliband keeps refusing to visit Rochdale, represented by her husband Simon, to avoid a Gillian Duffy moment, which wrecked the 2010 election campaign for Labour. Mrs Duffy’s notorious encounter with Gordon Brown damaged Labour’s election hopes  after he was caught on a microphone calling her a ‘bigoted woman’ for raising concerns about immigration. Mrs Danczuk said: 'I keep inviting Ed to Rochdale. He won't because of Gillian Duffy. His people think, 'Oh my God, it's Rochdale'. But he should do it'.

Mrs Danczuk says Ed Miliband is refusing to return to the town . Yesterday she revealed she was repeatedly raped from the age of six by a family friend and has now gone to police. The mother of two said years of abuse brought on suicidal feelings, and prompted her to wear black from ‘head to toe’ to avoid attention. The 31-year-old spent 20 years on anti-depressants for two decades, self-harming and attempting suicide in 2007. But she said her famous selfies have helped win back her confidence and said she took up the habit because she can now ‘have fun without being ashamed of myself’. She described how she met her local MP Simon Danczuk - 16 years older than her -  who 'is the only man I've truly loved. He has made me so happy. He made me feel wanted'. She told The Sun's Jane Atkinson and Craig Woodhouse her abuser was a family friend who first preyed on her when she was only six years old. ‘He was just someone who would be around a lot. I didn’t take much notice of him until one night he came up to my bedroom. 'He didn’t chat. He just came to my bed, got hold of my hand and made me put it on [him]. 'He tried to make it a game. I was young, but I knew right from wrong. It was wrong.’ She said the man abused her repeatedly. ‘I never said a word. Tears would roll down my face but I tried not to acknowledge what was happening,' she said. 'I’d try to blank it out. I had a very unhappy childhood. I wouldn’t wish that on anybody.’ She said that after her abuse she felt ‘worthless’ and ‘guilty, as though I had somehow brought this on myself ... but I was just a little girl’. Mrs Danczuk, 31, a Labour councillor, is married to Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 47 (together above) The mother - who describes herself online as the Queen of the Selfie - said years of abuse brought on suicidal feelings, and prompted her to wear black from ‘head to toe’ to avoid attention. She said she now feels 'free' She continued: ‘I was on anti-depressants for years and wanted to kill myself. I used to cover my body, wear head-to-toe black clothes so I didn’t draw attention to myself, I was so self-conscious. I now know I didn’t do anything wrong. Finally I realised it isn’t my fault. ‘I can have fun without being ashamed of myself. And that is why I take pictures and put them on Twitter – because I can. I’m now free to do whatever I want.’ Mrs Danczuk – who describes herself online as the Queen of the Selfie – announced last month that she will stand down as a Labour councillor for Kingsway, Rochdale at the next election to pursue other opportunities. She is believed to be interested in working in television, and has alreay hired a London-based PR agency.

I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.' Mr Donnelly added: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.' The pair's less-than-complimentary assessment of the Labour leader was backed by the former Oasis front-man Noel Gallagher. The Mancunian lead singer, who said he used to 'really believe in Tony Blair, said he no longer felt there was anyone to vote for - because 'they're all just career politicians'. He said Nigel Farage was not 'mentally capable of running a corner shop' – and predicted Boris Johnson would be the next Prime Minister. The former Oasis lead singer said: 'These days, my own view is that if they truly, truly wanted to f******g better the lives of the people, surely they must all realise that a little bit of conservatism married with a little bit of socialism, married with a little bit of f*****g Ukip and a little bit of Green and a little bit of Lib Democrats would be kind of perfect. 'But they're all into power, they're not into politics. And they're all career politicians and populists. And you know, the next Prime Minister after this one will be Boris Johnson because of that.' Mr Gallagher said he would cast his ballot at the election, but claimed there was 'nothing to vote for any more'. The former Oasis frontman said he 'really believed' in Tony Blair before he took Britain to war against Iraq . He said: 'Yeah, I vote all the time. I'll pick the most ludicrous thing on the f*****g ballot. 'Last time I voted for a little guy who was standing round here as a pirate. I can't not vote, because I think that's copping out, but my vote is to f*****g vote for something ludicrous because the Labour Party are a f*****g waste of time. 'I just don't trust – trust is not the right word – I don't believe in any of them. I really believed in Tony Blair, for right or wrong, and until Al Qaeda flew those planes into those towers. 'Everyone seems to forget that things before that were f*****g alright. And now the Conservatives are just... I mean, what the f**k? 'David Cameron, he's trying to be your mate. 'Oh, I really like The Jam.' Thatcher was just like, 'I'm f*****g you in the arse, f**k what you say.' You can kind of respect that.' Mr Gallagher, who made the remarks in an interview with the music magazine Quietus, also revealed Russell Brand tries to convince him to become a revolutionary - but said he was not 'into politics' anymore. He said he watched the comedian on Question Time against Nigel Farage. He said: 'I don't really know a great deal about him, but I saw him on that with Russell. 'He doesn't look like he could be mentally capable of running a corner shop, far less a f*****g country. '","Labour voters Ant and Dec attacked Ed Miliband and the Labour Party .

"A pensioner who thought the couple next door’s garden was not tidy enough threatened to burn down their house, a court heard. John Bushell, 89, whose own garden is his pride and joy, has subjected neighbours to abuse for decades, claiming their inferior properties devalue his. The retired bookkeeper and neighbour from hell has already had five convictions over his anti-social behaviour and spent time in prison in 2001. This week he was back in court for breaching a restraining order for the tenth time. John Bushell has appeared in court for breaking a restraining order for the 10th time against his neighbours, who he has harassed and abused for four decades because he believes they do not maintain their gardens . The targets of his tirade were retired furniture maker Kenneth Mills and his wife Marjorie, both 69, who say they have been abused on numerous occasions since moving beside Bushell in 1970. In 2012, a court heard how Bushell accused them of living in a ‘midden’, a 14th century word for a manure dump, and called them ‘scumbags’. In the latest incident, Mr Mills was in his garden with another neighbour when Bushell could be heard shouting: ‘I’m going to get shot of you, burn your house down before I die.’ On Monday he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court where district judge Helen Cousins said: ‘Your garden looks very beautiful but you can’t behave as you did.’ She sentenced him to an eight-week custodial sentence suspended for two years and urged him to move. Yesterday Mr and Mrs Mills described how their lives had been made a misery by living beside Bushell. They have tried repeatedly to put their house on the market but said potential buyers have always been scared off after learning about Bushell’s behaviour. Bushell claims he cannot sell his house because of the state of neighbouring gardens. The pensioner claims the home belonging to his neighbours (right) Mr and Mrs Mills is not maintained properly . John Bushell (left, leaving court) has repeatedly broken a restraining order by harassing Mr Mills (right) Mr and Mrs Mills said they were first abused shortly after moving to their home in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, while Bushell was first issued with a restraining order in 1998. In court Bushell’s defence claimed his latest verbal onslaught was an ‘empty threat’ which the pensioner had no intention of carrying out. Charlton Carr told the hearing: ‘He is a very house-proud man who likes everything in its place. Unfortunately he hasn’t got on with his neighbours over a period of time because he feels they don’t appear to look after their properties in the same manner.’ He said the offence was the result of frustration because potential buyers see that neighbouring houses are not as nice, which Bushell believes lowers the value of his property. After the case Bushell, who lives with his wife, said: ‘I’ve taken the house off the market. Polished statutes, white trellis and a perfectly manicured lawn is seen outside Mr Bushell's detached home . Ken and Marjorie Mills claim they have been harassed by their neighbour for around four decades . Bushell's home in the summer shows a garden full of flowers, which he believes is of higher standard . ‘Who is going to buy it when you see the state of the gardens around here? I don’t drink or smoke, I just want a quiet life looking after my garden.’ Mr Mills yesterday denied there was any problem with the exterior of his house and said Bushell was using it as an excuse to justify his abuse. The grandfather added: ‘He has got a lovely garden and looks after his place, but there is nothing wrong with our garden. It is neat and tidy. ‘There were occasions when it has got so bad we have thought ‘‘we have to move’’ and that’s why we have put the house up for sale. But it’s a bit late in the day for us to move. Bushell claims he has been unable to sell his £200,000 home because residents do not keep up standards . Mr and Mrs Mills said Bushell threatened to burn down their home because he doesn't like their garden . ‘He goes to court and goes quiet for a time but then you can see him winding up and getting more angry and he does it again. ‘My wife was affected by it a few years ago. She had panic attacks and took medication for her nerves. ‘Twenty years ago it did affect me. He used to be very frightening and I never used to enjoy coming home from work, thinking that he would be at the gate.’ Bushell has said other properties in the street are not of the correct standard and devalue his property . 1960- John Bushell moved into detached property in Hebburn and disputes with neighbours begin. They claim he painted a whitewashed wall black and tipped rubbish into their gardens. 1963 - Ken and Marjorie Mills moved into the house next door. 1998 - Bushell issued with an indefinite restraining order to stop him harassing the couple, following an expletive-laden row with them over the garden fence. 2001 - Jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for three months after admitting three charges of harassment against the Mills' and breaching the order. Judge Michael Cartlidge sees secret video made by neighbours, and told him: 'We all love our homes but this is hopeless. This is not someone with a short fuse. It is someone with no fuse at all.' 2005 - Breached restraining order again after he nailed a plank of wood to their driveway wall. 2006 - Bushell admitted breaching the restraining order twice and threatening to cause criminal damage. He was given a three year conditional discharge and fined £150. 2011 -Sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for nine months, after he breached a restraining order by climbing up on a garage and shouting abuse at the couple. 2012- In court again after calling his neighbours 'scumbags' in another breach of the restraining order.  Given a conditional discharge. 2013 - Prison sentence of two months, suspended for a year, for wasting police time after he pulled down his own guttering and blamed his neighbours for the damage. 2015 - Sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for two years, after threatening to burn his neighbours' house down over the state of their garden.","John Bushell moved into his detached home in Tyne and Wear in 1960 .

"Michael Swales leaving court at an earlier appearance. Today he escaped jail despite admitting stealing £4,200 from a pensioner to fund his drug habit . A drug addict who stole thousands of pounds from a pensioner has escaped jail after his victim forgave him and even left his home to him in his will. Michael Swales, 41, stole more than £4,000 from 72-year-old family friend Trevor Barker after learning the pensioner had been storing the cash under his mattress to pay for his funeral. Retired factor worker Mr Barker, who has no children and lives alone in Nelson, Lancashire, acted as a friend to Swales for 25 years since meeting him as a 16-year-old when he arrived at the textile factory where he worked. Mr Barker, who also uses a chairlift, treated Swales like a son, letting him lodge at his house and then bought him a new sofa and kitchenware when he got his own flat in Colne, Lancashire. At Burnley Crown Court, Swales admitted theft but was sentenced to eight months in jail, suspended for two years, with 12 months supervision. He was also ordered to take part in a nine month drugs programme after the victim offered to take him in again. Mr Barker, who watched from the public gallery as Swales was ordered to also pay £250 compensation, said after the hearing: 'You've got to give people a chance. I shall help him. 'He has always been a nice lad, he has just fallen by the wayside. There will always be a place for Michael at my home. When I die, he gets my house in trust.' Earlier the court heard Mr Barker, who suffers from arthritis, was a friend of the Swales since he was 16 when they worked at Smith and Nephew. Around 18 months before the theft, Swales’ father Derek had turned up at Mr Barker’s door and asked if his son could stay with him. The victim agreed and put Swales up in his front bedroom for around nine months during which he told him had been saving up for his funeral with Brierfield Co-op and had saved about £6,000. He told Swales that if anything should happen to him, it was kept in a money bag between two mattresses on his bed. Mr Barker needed two mattresses to assist him to get in bed. The money bag was pushed in deep between the two mattresses. Prosecutor David Clarke said Swales eventually moved out but on December 2 last year, he returned to the house and told Mr Barker he needed to go upstairs to find his mobile phone which he falsely claimed was missing. He went up to the bedroom and took £4,250, leaving about £1,200 with the band around it. Mr Clarke explained: 'It seems Mr Barker, who uses a stairlift, only subsequently got to the top of the stairs. 'The defendant left almost immediately, saying he had not found the phone. Mr Barker looked around and made the discovery. ' Swales was arrested on December 8 and said he had been well aware what the money was for but he had fallen into a drugs habit. Victim Trevor Barker at his home in Nelson, Lancashire. Mr Barker has decided to forgive Swales, who he has known since he was 16, and says he is leaving his house to him in his will . Mr Clarke continued: 'He said he had a debt of around £200 or so and he took this money to be used to pay off the drugs debt and taxi fares when he went in taxis to collect more drugs as his addiction took hold of him. 'He said at the end of the interview he was ashamed of himself.' In his victim impact statement, Mr Barker said the theft had made him 'feel ill and sick to his stomach.' He added: 'I am devastated. I could break down and cry. Michael knew he could talk to me, but he has stolen money from me. I have not slept since. I feel in shock, like I have flu. 'This has made his parents very upset and angry. They feel guilty, but I have told them they should not. He is an adult and is responsible for his own actions. ' But the court heard Mr Barker had taken a benevolent view of the overall situation and whilst wishing Swales to be punished agreed to offer him accommodation. Mr Baker has now left his home in Nelson, Lancashire, pictured, to Swales despite him being convicted of theft . In mitigation defence counsel Philip Holden said Swales’ remorse was 'genuine' and he was on a course of methadone. Mr Holden urged the judge to suspend the sentence of imprisonment which, he said, was merited. He added: 'It would, in my submission, provide the most constructive disposal for a man who is assessed as a low risk of offending and a low risk of causing serious harm. 'The defendant is perhaps fortunate that the unfortunate victim of this case has come along today and made the very fair comments that he has.' Passing sentence, Judge Jonathan Gibson said Swales’ actions had been a 'gross breach of trust' when the victim had shown him nothing but kindness and support. Judge Gibson said of Mr Barker: 'One can only sympathise with what he said in his statement. 'He must have suffered very great shock and one can understand .","Michael Swales, 41, stole more than £4,000 from family friend Trevor Barker .

"Infamous heiress Patty Hearst is back in the news after a dog she co-owns won its group at the Westminster Kennel Club show. A shih tzu called Rocket was picked as the top toy dog at Madison Square Garden on Monday. Hearst is the granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst and gained great notoriety in 1974 when she was kidnapped by the radical group the Symbionese Liberation Army. Scroll down for video . Infamous heiress Patty Hearst is back in the news after a dog she co-owns won its group at the Westminster Kennel Club show. The photo on the left was released by the FBI in 1974 when she was kidnapped by the radical group the Symbionese Liberation Army . She was seen holding a machine gun while robbing a California bank, and later spent almost two years in prison. During her trial, Ms Hearst's lawyers argued that she had been brainwashed by the kidnappers, which has led to her being regarded as a victim of Stockholm Syndrome. Her sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter. President Bill Clinton gave her a full pardon. Hurst was abducted on February 4, 1974 from her apartment in Benvenue Street in Berkleley, California. The group of heavily armed men and women grabbed Hurst and bundled her into the boot of a car by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. The gang was lead by Donald DeFreeze and wanted to overthrow capitalism. Following her abduction, the SLA released several communiques demanding millions of dollars worth of food donations in return for her safe release. The terrorists used the time to brainwash the then 19-year-old Hearst and locked her in a cupboard. In April 1974, the SLA released a message from Hearst claiming she had joined the revolution and was seeking to overthrow capitalism. Less than two weeks later she was seen on surveillance footage in a bank brandishing a semi-automatic assault rifle, . On May 16, two members of the SLA tried to steal an ammunition belt from a Los Angeles shop and were forced to abandon their getaway van. The FBI were able to link the van to an SLA safehouse and raided the property the following morning. Six members of the SLA, including DeFreeze were killed during the shoot out. The house caught fire. Hearst escaped from the scene but was eventually captured in San Francisco on September 18, 1975. Her defence team tried to convince the jury that she had been brainwashed and abused by the terrorist organisation. She was jailed for seven years after her conviction, but was released within two years. 'People move on,' she said, smiling at Rocket. 'I guess people somehow imagine you don't evolve in your life. I have grown daughters and grand-daughters and other things that normal people have.' She also has appeared in films including Cry-Baby and Serial Mom. She's done television roles and charitable work. Hearst has been involved in the dog show world for more than 10 years. She said many are surprised to find out she's moved on to play with pooches. Rocket a shih tzu co-owned by famed and infamous heiress Patty Hearst is inspected by the judge in the ring during the toy group competition during the Westminster Kennel Club dog show on Monday . On April 15, 1974, Hearst was photographed wielding a M1 carbine while robbing the Sunset District branch of the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco . Hearst, who turns 61 on Friday, is one of Rocket's three co-owners. She's mostly worked with French bulldogs and one of them won an award ribbon earlier in the day. Hearst's dog will be one of seven in the championship ring on Tuesday night when best in show is chosen. That will cause her to do some shifting — she didn't originally have tickets for the finals. Even though Hearst loves dogs, her two daughters own cats. 'I don't know what I did wrong,' she said. Hearst's feather William Randolph Hearst was a newspaper magnate who was widely considered to have been the inspiration for the megalomaniac central character in Citizen Kane. Hearst has appeared in films including Serial Mom, the 1994 John Walters' movie staring Kathleen Turner . Following her release from prison, Patty married her bodyguard, Bernard Shaw. He died aged 68 in 2013 . Her extraordinary tale has spawned countless books and movies, including the 1988 film Patty Hearst, based on her autobiography and starring Natasha Richardson. Following her release from prison, Patty married her bodyguard, Bernard Shaw. He died aged 68 in 2013. The couple had two daughters, Gillian and Lydia, a model and actress who has appeared on the cover of glossy magazines such as Vogue.","A shih tzu called Rocket was picked as the top toy dog at the Westminster Kennel Club show in New York on Monday .

"A married couple accused of squatting in a string of multimillion-dollar homes has holed up and refused to pay rent in a luxury home on California's coast. Two months after Gina and Paul Schwendel signed a lease and moved into a $4.4million home in Del Sur, their landlord, Dennis Simpson, says he has yet to receive any money in rent. Instead, he tells KGTV, the couple complained that the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home with waterfront views is uninhabitable. Scroll down for video . 'Professional tenants': A married couple accused of squatting in a string of multimillion-dollar homes has holed up and refused to pay rent in a luxury home in Del Sur on California's coastline . When Simpson arrived to check on the home, he says he found the garage had been stuffed full of sporting equipment and appliances. 'I said, ""You know, you live like a pig. You don't respect this property. I want you out of here,""' Simpson says he told Paul Schwendel. After another visit following a 24-hour notice, the Schwendels filed a restraining order against Simpson, calling him 'violent, threatening and demeaning.' The order also stated Simpson 'broke into our home, physically pushed me and my son' and that the Schwendels and their four children are 'scared that he will return to our home and violently act out against us.' But some believe the claims are just part of the Schwendels' strategy of squatting, as the couple has had to be evicted from three other luxury properties in California. 'This is what I would call a professional tenant,' said eviction attorney Steven Silverstein, who had the Schwendels tossed from another multimillion-dollar home in Newport Beach. 'They come in with a lot of money, a lot of flash, a lot of glitz,' says Silverstein. Uninhabitable conditions: Landlord Dennis Simpson says that he responded to complaints that the property was in poor shape and found the garage overflowing with sporting equipment and appliances . Paradise: The couple has been living in, and evicted from, a number of luxury homes, including some high-priced pads in Orange County . Legal quagmire: Simpson faces a lengthy eviction process if the Schwendels don't pay, along with a restraining order the couple has filed against him . The approach has landed the Schwendels in a 10,000-square-foot pad in upscale Orange County and a fourth luxury home in Laguna Beach, all of which they were evicted from, according to KGTV. Court documents filed in Georgia also show that Paul Schwendel was sued in 2005 by his ex-wife for $100,000 in unpaid child support and $59,000 in late alimony payments. Nothing in the couple's background was caught by Simpson, who says he believed Schwendel was working a high-paying job. 'I did check his application and he said he made $55,000 a month and he's been working in the business for 14 years,' Simpson said. 'But I found out that wasn't true either... so yes, I do feel that I have been duped.' A LinkedIn profile for Paul Schwendel lists him as CEO of Evolution Healthcare. Georgia state records indicate that Evolution Healthcare was registered as a limited liability corporation in 2009 by Schwendel. KGTV said the Schwendels did not sit for an interview, despite a promise from Gina Schwendel. Simpson states the next rent check for $12,500 is due on March 1, though he is skeptical that he'll be seeing any money.","Gina and Paul Schwendel moved in two months ago into a $4.4million home with a waterfront view in Del Sur, California .

"Alexandra Klimenko was picking up her youngest child from nursery when the sudden violent explosion shook the Ukrainian street. When the dust cleared, they would find the 33-year-old's body shielding her beloved three-year-old daughter. Alexandra - called Sashinka by friends and family - was dead, killed by a rocket launched 80 miles away by a pro-Russian rebel. In the Ukraine - just a four hour flight away from the safety of the UK - carrying on everyday tasks can prove fatal, and even hiding in your home will not shield you from the rockets the two sides are firing at each other. Devastated: Alexander Klimenko says goodbye to his wife Alexandra, who was killed by a rebel rocket . Tragedy: The body of Vladimir Kolozin lies in the street next to the biscuits he had bought from the shop. His wife Tanya was killed seconds later in a separate attack, which saw a missile hit the couple's balcony . Since fighting broke out between the Ukrainian government and the Moscow-backed separatists almost a year ago, nearly 6,000 people have been killed. The fierce fighting has driven an estimated 1million people from their homes. A ceasefire agreed in Minsk last week, which should have seen both sides start to withdraw from a 'buffer zone' around the front line from Sunday, has had little effect. Indeed, rebels said they had no intention of observing the ceasefire at Debaltseve, where they have been advancing since January and now have a Ukrainian unit all but encircled. Meanwhile, one rebel commander claimed the Ukrainian army had broken the ceasefire 27 times in the just 24 hours. Images of the conflict circulating in western media show tanks, soldiers and the occasional bursts of rockets being launched. What they rarely show are the people still trapped between the two warring factions, desperately trying to carry on with their everyday lives - just like millions across Europe. Broken: The ceasefire agreed between the two sides is not being stuck to by either the government or rebels . Clean up: Residents who have not fled the battle zones are left to deal with the consequences of the war . One million: It is estimated up to a million people have left since the war started almost a year ago . Destroyed: Igor shows of the damage to his flat after last Tuesday's assault on Kramtorsk . So it is easy to forget the countless stories of loss, and the suffering Europe has not experienced since the genocidal bloodletting that engulfed the Balkans in the 1990s. On February 10, Alexandra became another of those countless stories. She had left her home in Kramatorsk, a city to the north of Donetsk, to pick up her daughter from nursery. She was in a rush: her seven-year-old son was at home, ill with the flu, and she wanted to get back to him as quickly as possible. But she never returned home. Instead, she was killed by a Tornado rocket – one of the most sophisticated weapons in Moscow’s arsenal - when she was a couple of steps from the entrance to her building. Several other shells had landed around her, tearing massive holes into the sides of buildings, shattering windows and destroying cars. Bereaved: Nearly 6,000 people have died - including innocent civilians like mother-of-two Alexandra . Mourning: The graves of fighters without names marked with numbers in the cemetery of Mospyne . Her neighbours said she’d thrown herself on top of her daughter to protect her from the explosions. Shrapnel from the rocket tore into the child’s arm and killed Alexandra instantly. ‘My neighbour told me to call her after we heard the explosions. I never thought anything might happen,’ recalled Alexandra’s aunt, Tatyana Alexandrovna, in her flat Saturday. ‘She hadn’t phoned all day and I knew her son had been ill for a couple of days. 'Normally, her going to the day care earlier than usual wouldn’t have warranted a phone call,’ she added. Her aunt attempted to reach her via mobile phone at least half a dozen times. ‘I kept calling and calling…there was no answer. I tried again, then again. The mobile provider kept giving me a message that she wasn’t available. 'Finally I got through and a very hesitant man’s voice was on the other end, ‘ said Tatyana. ‘Where is my Sashinka?’ ‘She’s dead. A shell exploded and killed her. I’m sorry,’ said the voice before hanging up. ‘I froze. I just didn’t know what to do,' Tatyana said. 'My neighbour got me together and insisted we go to her flat. When we arrived the neighbours told us the emergency teams had taken her to a nearby hospital with all those who’d been wounded. 'We rushed there hoping that maybe the man on the phone had been wrong; maybe she was just hurt and still alive. 'When we got to the emergency room the doctors told us she was dead on arrival and that they may have to amputate her daughter’s arm.' At Alexandra’s funeral, relatives and friends as well as her distraught husband decried the on going violence, blaming all involved for waging war on the local population. Her son has yet to be told of his mother’s death. ‘I wanted to take him to the coffin and let him kiss mummy goodbye. I just couldn’t do it. He keeps asking for her. I have no idea what to do,’ said her husband Alexander, who works in Moscow. ‘The little one in the hospital doesn’t speak expect for when asleep, calling out for mum. We’re just happy the doctors didn’t have to amputate,’ said Tatyana Alexandrovna. ‘We still need to tell her 93-year-old grandmother. She’s been asking about her for days, wondering why, “my Sashinka hasn’t come to visit.” We still don’t know how to tell her what happened.’ On a different part of the city, another family is coming to terms with its own horrendous tragedy - a tragedy which serves to show arbitrary cruelty of this civil war. Vladimir Kolozin, a 62-year-old former engineer and director at the city’s NKMZ machine factory, was returning home after buying biscuits a rocket exploded less than five feet away. The blast threw him against the wall of the building behind him, nearly blowing off his face in the process. Killing: People have died on both sides of the conflict. Here, girls are pictured at a separatist fighter's funeral . Waste: It was hoped the ceasefire would bring an end to the deaths of civilians and fighters like this one . Picking up the pieces: All the people left behind can do is try to continue to live their lives . Splayed out on the frozen pavement, his newly bought biscuits lay just a few inches from the hand that was carrying them home. Seconds later, his wife Tamara - who was awaiting his return home for their midday meal - was killed as a second rocket ripped through the couple’s balcony. All three - Alexandra, Vladimir and Tanya - were killed in the same spate of attacks last Tuesday. On Saturday, Kolozin’s former colleagues participated in a citywide vigil for those killed in last Tuesday’s attack. Far from being unique, it was one of hundreds which have rained down on countless towns in eastern Ukraine. Caught between the combatants, the civilians that are forced to endure the horror of indiscriminate shelling. Nearly 14,000 people have been wounded since fighting between Ukrainian armed forces and pro-Moscow rebels, backed by regular Russian army units, began last April. Shattered: Windows in Kramatorsk have been blown in by the blasts - letting freezing air into homes . Destruction: Despite the chaos around them, people remain hopeful things might change for the better. 'It was a lovely flat once,' Igor told MailOnline. 'Once all of this is over and Putin leaves us alone, It will be again' As has been the case on dozens of occasions in Donetsk, Slavyansk, Debaltsevo and Mariupol, Kramatorsk’s emergency room surgeons had to work frantically to care for the dozens of wounded flooding in the door, while nurses and orderlies were charged with trying to console family members that had packed into the dark hospital corridors. ‘My husband is in surgery. They won’t tell me anything other than to wait. He was just at work like any other day,’ a distraught young woman named Marina said in the city’s main hospital, shortly after last week’s attack. Those who survive are left to pick up the pieces; comforting distraught relatives and cleaning up their shattered homes. Yana, whose flat is around the corner from where Kolozin and his wife were killed, is one of those people. ‘I was sitting here in my bedroom – my husband had just decided to go downstairs to the shop when I heard heavy concussion explosions,' she told MailOnline. 'Luckily, I had just walked into the next room when a shell exploded right outside our balcony.' Yana and her husband Igor, a couple in the mid-50s, have spent most of their life savings from their meagre earnings as engineers to refurbish their flat in an old Stalin-era building in the city centre. Amid the shattered glass, pock marked walls are the couple’s charming collection bric-a-brac from their trips to Thailand, Goa and Singapore. ‘Well, it was a lovely flat once. Once all of this is over and Putin leaves us alone, It will be again,’ said Igor.","Alexandra Klimenko killed as she picked up her daughter from nursery .

"This is the moment a 92-year-old driver smashes into nine cars as he leaves a grocery store after getting his foot caught on the accelerator. CCTV footage shows Russell Kerr slowly reversing out of a parking spot before suddenly zipping forwards and backwards to strike multiple vehicles at the same time. Moments later, another security camera at the Piggly Wiggly shopping center in Mayville, Wisconsin, shows him plowing  into a pick-up truck and speeding off with debris flying everywhere. The driver of the SUV gets out and begins to chase  Kerr in a bid to prevent further damage. Another  man joins him. Bad driving conditions were not to blame as there is no snow or ice seen on the ground. Kerr was eventually stopped and reported to authorities. The senior citizen explained that he got his foot caught on the gas pedal of his 2007 Chrysler Pacifica and lost control of the wheel amid a state of panic. His vehicle and the pick-up he struck were towed from the scene while other drivers were left to file insurance claims. Nobody was injured in last Friday's  incident. Caught on camera: This is the moment a 92-year-old driver smashes into nine cars as he leaves a grocery store after getting his foot caught on the accelerator . Knock-on effect: CCTV footage shows Russell Kerr slowly reversing out of a parking spot before suddenly zipping forwards and backwards striking multiple vehicles at the same time . Freak accident: The senior explained that he got his foot caught on the gas pedal of his 2007 Chrysler Pacifica and lost control of it amid a state of panic . On a roll: Moments later, another security camera at the Piggly Wiggly shopping center in Mayville, Wisconsin, shows him plowing into a pick-up truck and speeding off with debris flying everywhere. The driver of the SUV gets out and begins to chase Kerr in a bid to prevent further damage, then another man joins him . Mayville police chief Christopher MacNeill said in 23 years of law enforcement, he'd never seen anything like it. He said it was fortunate there were no pedestrians walking out with their groceries at the time. The event was deemed an accident and Kerr was not charged. However, his license will be reviewed by the Department of Motor Vehicles to determine if he needs to be retested.","CCTV footage shows Russell Kerr reversing out of a parking spot before suddenly zipping around and striking multiple vehicles .

"A dog walker has survived after plunging more than 100ft down a sheer cliff face while walking her pets at a beauty spot. The 47-year-old had been walking along the clifftops at Hengistbury Head near Christchurch, Dorset, when she slipped and fell, possibly while chasing after one of her dogs. Emergency rescue teams deployed to the headland at the mouth of Christchurch Harbour were amazed to find the woman alive and conscious, leaning against a rock at the bottom of the cliff. Scroll down for video . A dog walker has survived after plunging more than 100ft down a sheer cliff face while walking her pets at Hengistbury Head near Christchurch, Dorset . The 47-year-old had been walking along the clifftops at Hengistbury Head near Christchurch, Dorset, when she slipped and fell, possibly while chasing after one of her dogs . She suffered back injuries in the 100ft fall and was placed on a spinal board before being airlifted off the beach by coastguard helicopter. Coastguards today said it was an 'absolute miracle' that the unnamed woman was not killed. The woman, who is thought to live in the Christchurch area, was flown to Southampton Hospital, Hampshire and was today said to be in a critical but stable condition. The woman had fallen 100ft from the top of this cliff . A member of her family arrived soon after the rescue at 12.45pm yesterday to collect her dogs from the top of the cliff, close to the site of an old coastguard lookout hut. 'The lady was walking her two dogs along the clifftop at 11.30am at Hengistbury Head close to an old coastguard lookout building when she fell over the side,' said a spokesman for the Mudeford lifeboat crew, which was first on the scene. 'We have no idea yet how she came to fall over the cliff - she might have been going after one of her dogs, but we don't know. 'She fell around 100ft to the bottom of the cliffs. Luckily a member of the public saw her fall and called 999 straight away. 'Our lifeboat crew were on the scene within a few minutes and we found her conscious, sat up against a rock at the foot of the cliff. 'Three of our team went ashore to administer first aid. Amazingly it appeared she had only hurt her back. 'Very soon after a team of coastguards from Southbourne arrived and then the coastguard helicopter. The lady was then airlifted to hospital in Southampton. 'We initially called the RSPCA to look after the dogs but then a family member arrived to take them, which would suggest she was local. 'It is an absolute miracle that she survived the fall, let alone escape just with back injuries. 'It could have been so much worse.' Pete Dadds, a member of the RNLI crew, added: 'There are not many people that can survive a tumble down a 100ft cliff.' The fall has prompted coastguards to issue a warning to walkers, urging them to take care on coastal paths and stay well clear of cliff edges. Emergency rescue teams deployed to the headland at the mouth of Christchurch Harbour were amazed to find the woman alive and conscious, leaning against a rock at the bottom of the cliff . She suffered back injuries in the 100ft fall and was placed on a spinal board before being airlifted off the beach by coastguard helicopter . The woman had been walking her two dogs along this clifftop when she fell to the beach below . Peter Davies, from HM Coastguard, said: 'If you are going to the coast this half-term please take care along cliffs and coastal footpaths. 'The gradient at which cliffs fall away from the paths can be deceptive and following wet weather some cliff edges may be slippery or unstable. 'If you do spot someone in difficulty along the coast call 999 and ask for the Coastguard.' A spokesman for Dorset Police said the incident was not being treated as suspicious.

"A food artist has immortalised a slew of celebrities including Holly Willoughby, Julia Roberts, Kate Middleton and David Beckham,using eggs, four and milk - just in time for Pancake Day. Nathan Shields, a stay-at-home father and former mathematics teacher, has created a portfolio of pancake portraits  of celebrities using a squeezy bottle of batter as his paint. And he's been busy, capturing A listers including  Cheryl Cole, Emma Bunton, Tess Daley, Anna Wintour, Alan Sugar and Victoria Beckham. Scroll down for video . Pancake portraits by work-at-home father and pancake artist Nathan Shields . Kim Kardashian's pancake homage (left) is as full-lipped as the real Kim Kardashian (right) Pancake Kate (left) is as smiley as her real life counterpart (right) with the same mane of hair . Mr Shields, from Houston, Texas, created the portraits for Lyle's Golden Syrup to mark Shrove Tuesday on 17 February. Using a squeezy mustard or ketchup bottle, his freehand drawing skills are truly a sight to behold. Using two types of batter - a plain flour mix and a chocolate version - he skillfully sketches out the outline of the celebrity. As the pancake cooks and becomes darker, he works against the clock to fill in the surrounding areas of the pan with details such as the hair and facial features like the eyes, nose and mouth. The surrounding areas of the pancake are further filled in before he quickly flips the pancake over to show the finished result. But there are far more astonishing pancake themes on his website Saipancakes.com, from tropical birds, exotic seashells, animal tracks, as well as Winnie the Pooh and Star Wars characters. MrShields's  representation of Holly Willoughby in crepe form (left) and the real thing (right) The resemblance is uncanny! Mr Shield's flour and water homage (left)  to X Factor judge Cheryl Cole (right) Mr Shields said it was his mother who first inspired his craft, having grown up with her making 'monster pancakes' for him as a child. However, he does admit it getting more challenging to come up with new pancake themes. 'It's getting harder and harder to come up with them but people are recommending them on my website,' he said to Good Day Sacremento. The art of pancake portaiture: A steady hand is needed in order to not muss up the edges of the batter . Can you tell the difference?: Pancake Julia Roberts in the 1980s (left) next to the real-life version (right) Mr Shields may have got the famously unsmiling Victoria Beckham's expression right but he could have done better with her hairstyle, which is at least ten years out of date . Outside of that, his hardest theme he's accomplished so far he says was his capture of a series of marine invertebrates seen on his blog. His portfolio of pancake images on his website boasts a broad range of topics including themes from science, nature and popular culture. Mr Shields began posting videos to YouTube last year to spread pancake love around the globe. Mr Shields has also created pancake portraits of characters from the The Hobbit . Mr Shields created the portraits for Lyle's Golden Syrup to mark Shrove Tuesday on 17 February. Research was conducted by Lyle's Golden Syrup to uncover the most famous celebrity smiles . Sara Harrison at Lyle's Golden Syrup said: 'We want to encourage people to have a bit of fun this Pancake Day, get creative and spread smiles in the kitchen.

"A Chinese man has donated blood 147 times in just 10 years in a bid to keep his wife alive. Wang Xiaoying was diagnosed with anaemia in 2003, after she collapsed in front of her husband, Xu Wenwu. The condition, caused by an iron deficiency, means the body is unable to produce enough red blood cells. It leaves sufferers feeling weak and unable to concentrate, and in Wang Xiaoying's case, it left her in need of regular blood transfusions. Xu Wenwu, right, has donated blood 147 times in the last 10 years after his wife Wang Xiaoying was diagnosed with anaemia, a condition which prevents the body producing enough red blood cells, leaving sufferers feeling weak . The 45-year-old, pictured with some of his blood transfusion records, has been donated at a blood bank, to allow his wife to claim free transfusions, after tests showed he was not a match for her blood type . In China people can pay for the procedure, but 45-year-old Xu Wenwu was unable to afford the cost. But the law dictates that anybody who wants to have a free transfusion for themselves or their family, can do so, if they donate 800ml of blood to the blood bank at frequent intervals. So, despite discovering that his own blood type was not a suitable match for his wife, the 38-year-old was still eligible to receive regular free supplies as long as her husband continued to donate blood. Over the last 10 years, Xu Wenwu, from the city of Changchun in the north-eastern province of Jilin, has donated 147 times, to allow his wife to claim her free transfusions. The NHS advises that healthy men only give blood every 12 weeks, or four times a year, which would total just 40 transfusions over the course of a decade. In the U.S. donations can be made every 56 days. Xu Wenwu said: 'I wish only one thing - that my wife might enjoy some good health with me before we end our days. 'We gave up on the possibility of children but at least then we had each other, but even that happiness has been deprived. In the UK the NHS recommends that men do not give blood more than four times a year, or 40 times over the course of a decade. In the US, it is every 56 days or roughly 60 times in a decade. Xu Wenwu said: 'I wish only one thing - that my wife might enjoy some good health with me before we end our days' 'When she started getting the transfusions we had a semblance of normality, but then she was diagnosed with myasthenia - a muscle wasting disease that leaves the sufferer incredibly weak and in her case bedridden. 'She can't even go to the bathroom unless I help her, and although I am electrician I have been fired 30 times now because when my wife calls and is having difficulty of course I have to go home to help her.' He said he would not give up, and was hoping against hope that there might still be some treatment for his wife that could give her back her health. He said: 'The blood transfusions leave me very weak as well, and lacking in energy to do many things, but I will never give up hoping and trying to find a solution for us both to be happy and healthy together.'","Wang Xiaoying was diagnosed with anaemia in 2003 after she collapsed .

"At least 35 more Egyptian Christians are feared to have been kidnapped by jihadists in retaliation for air strikes on targets in Libya. Militants from the Islamic State and Ansar Al-Sharia are understood to have rounded up dozens of farm workers in the wake of bombings by Cairo, it was reported by local media. The move is believed to be a direct response to strikes by Egyptian warplanes yesterday which came after fanatics released a horrific video showing the beheading of 21 Christians on a beach. It raises the chilling prospect of yet another mass execution in what is being seen as ISIS's bid to announce its presence in a new region where it is gaining influence. Marched to their deaths: At least 35 more Egyptians are believed to have been kidnapped by jihadists in Libya, raises the chilling prospect of yet another mass execution like the one seen on Sunday when the Islamic State released a horrific video showing the beheading of 21 Christians on a beach (above) Retaliation: Egypt blitzed ISIS training camps, weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of air strikes following the gruesome murder of captured Egyptian workers in a video (above) released on Sunday . Horror: Blood is seen in the Mediterranean Sea. In the video the jihadis say they now plan to 'conquer Rome' Initial reports said seven men had been seized, but that figure had risen to more than 35 by mid-afternoon yesterday, according to The Libya Herald. It came as Egypt blitzed ISIS training camps, weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of air strikes following the gruesome murder of captured Egyptian workers. Meanwhile, the Egyptian government called for the US-led coalition to also target ISIS in Libya. The bombing, Egypt's first official military action in Libya since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi four years ago, came after a day of international outrage at the slickly produced ISIS video. Lasting five minutes, it shows a group of Coptic Christians dressed in jumpsuits being marched one by one along a lonely beach, each held by a fighter clad in black. The men their, faces uncovered, are then made to kneel. A jihadist dressed in camouflage fatigues and speaking English with an American accent declares: 'All crusaders... the sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood.' Revenge: Egypt's Defence Ministry released these images of its air strikes on ISIS-held targets in Libya . The men are then forced to lie face-down before they are beheaded simultaneously. The camera zooms in on the water as it turns red. The US said the video showed the 'wanton killing of innocents'. Egyptian state TV showed warplanes over Libya as the military declared they were 'avenging Egyptian blood and retaliating against criminals and killers'. Libyan officials said 40 fighters and two civilians had been killed. The country's internationally recognised government, based in Tobruk, has been confined to the far east of the country since militias seized the capital Tripoli last year. The militias condemned the air strikes as a violation of Libya's sovereign territory. But Cairo called on the US-led coalition carrying out strikes over Syria and Iraq to broaden the scope of their operations to include Libya. 'Leaving things in Libya as they are without decisive intervention to suppress these terror groups constitutes a clear danger to international peace and security,' the Egyptian foreign ministry warned. Pope Tawadros II, the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Patriarch of the See of St Mark Cathedral, leads mass prayers for the Egyptians beheaded in Libya . ISIS appear to be exploiting the chaos in Libya to gain a foothold  in a new region where it is gaining influence . French president François Hollande called for the UN security council to meet over Libya and to take new measures against the growing power of the militants. Italy has already said it is willing to lead a coalition of European and North African countries to stop the ISIS advance in Libya. Significantly, it did not rule out using ground forces. The video of the beheadings, posted online by Libyan jihadists loyal to IS, is the first to come from outside the group's heartland of Syria and Iraq, raising fears it has established a new foothold just 650km from Italy. Pope Francis expressed 'profound sadness' at the murders. 'They were executed for nothing more than the fact that they were Christians,' he said last night. 'Their only words were: 'Jesus, help me!' Britain condemned the murders as 'barbaric'. The Egyptian workers were seized in separate kidnappings in December and January from the coastal town of Sirte in eastern Libya, under the control of Islamist groups. Libya, where wages are significantly higher than in Egypt, is home to a large community of both Muslim and Coptic Egyptians, with most working in the construction sector.","ISIS and Ansar Al-Sharia 'have kidnapped at least 35 farm workers in Libya'

"It's the apartment no one knew about, and the one that millions of Harry Potter fans around the world would love to see. Renowned actor Daniel Radcliffe has put his exclusive Melbourne apartment on the market after using the property as a home base in Australia for almost ten years. 98B St Georges Road in Toorak was purchased for $1.8 million by Radcliffe's parents Alan Radcliffe, a casting agent, and BBC casting director Marcia Gresham, and is expected to fetch around $2.4 million. Scroll down for video . Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe has put his penthouse apartment in Toorak, Melbourne on the market . The three-bedroom apartment on Georges Street was bought for %1.8 million . The 25-year-old Englishman had the property bought for him by his parents in 2006 for the filming of Rod Harvy's December Boys, in which the then-16-year-old actor played an Australian orphan. Radcliffe shot to fame at 11 years old when he was cast as the eponymous Harry Potter in the Warner Brothers film franchise, and is reported to have property in New York and London, as well as Melbourne. The three-bedroom property was transferred to the Kill Your Darlings actor in 2007 when he turned 18, and was made use of by family and friends when Radcliffe was occupied with projects overseas, reported Domain. Marshall White's Marcus Chiminello told Daily Mail Australia that despite loving the privacy the apartment offered, Radcliffe has found himself visiting Australia less frequently than in previous years and had decided to put the much-loved apartment up for sale. 'He's based himself full-time in New York and has sadly decided to move on,' said Mr Chiminello, . The property was bought in 2006 by Radcliffe's parents, who transferred ownership to him when he turned 18 .

Mr Chiminello said that the real estate agency had already had significant interest from Harry Potter enthusiasts, and said that he was intrigued to see whether that would play a role in the sale. 'I'm interested to see how many people come to the open house inspection dressed as Harry Potter,' Mr Chiminello said. 'Some people have said that they want to come down purely for the Harry factor, and I'd be intrigued to see if someone buys it purely for that reason.' The north facing St Georges Road apartment is spectacular in it's own right, winning the Victorian Apartment Project of the Year and nestled on one of Toorak's most exclusive streets. Estate agent Marcus Chiminello said that Radcliffe had made himself a permanent home in New York . Radcliffe reportedly loved the large living areas which were used for entertaining family and friends . The open plan living and dining area is panelled with timber floors . The suburb has the highest average property values in Melbourne, and is home to other well-known Australians including media personality Eddie McGuire, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, and and footballer Nathan Buckley. The Toorak residence is one of only two penthouse-style apartments in the development, and is elevated to provide exposure to sunlight and offer privacy. The apartment occupies the entire top level, and overlooks Melbourne's CBD and the Yarra River, located just five kilometres away in Melbourne's most expensive suburb. Developed by prestige builder Stonehenge, the residence is accessed by a private lift, and features timber floors, floor-to-ceiling windows, and opens onto a rooftop terrace.

"When Su Guiying placed a heartrending little note in her local paper asking for people to turn up at her funeral when she died, little did she know how it would change her life. The 90-year-old, who tragically lost all of her 17 children shortly after they were born or while they were still young, has finally been gifted the family she always craved after dozens of people decided they didn't want to wait for her funeral to show they cared. Used to spending the New Year festival alone, all of a sudden Su's home in the village of Hongxia on the outskirts of Ruichang City in southern China's Jiangxi province, was overrun with well-wishers touched by her lonely plea. Over the moon: Su Guiying (right) with one of dozens of people who have come to share New Year with her . A meal to savour: The 90-year-old is having food made for her for New Year for the first time in 40 years . Allow me: Dozens of well-wishers have arrived at Su's home in Hongxia on the outskirts of Ruichang City . A friendly face: the village in China's Jiangxi province has been overrun with strangers touched by Su's plea . All smiles: Su has already enjoyed one feast (right) before the actual day of Chinese New Year this Thursday . She was so overcome at the attention after years of isolation that, with the day itself fast approaching on February 19, she burst into tears and declared it already the best New Year's festival she has ever had. Su said: 'I married when I was young, just 17, but I lost my first two children and then my husband abandoned me saying I was unlucky. 'Then I remarried but the next nine children which I had almost every year died at birth or not so long after. 'My second husband died when I was 33. But I married a third time and we had six children together, though I stopped hoping after that about having a family. 'My child who lived the longest was aged three when he died, it broke my heart. I lost all the children and then my third husband died.' Desperate and alone, she adopted a girl at the age of two, but when the girl was 19 years old she tracked down her original parents, a wealthy couple from the Chinese capital Beijing, and left Su never to return. For the last 40 years since then she has lived on her own with no immediate family or friends but when her sad story was published in the run up to Chinese New Year, when families traditionally get together, she was inundated with offers of people who wanted to visit her. It means that her home has been decorated for New Year for the first time, people have started turning up bearing gifts for a New Year's feast, and there has been music and laughter from her new-found family. Struggling to get by: Su had a hard life on her own but now has a family after the community embraced her . Shut away: Su has been lonely since her adopted daughter left aged 19 after tracking down her original parents, a wealthy couple from the Chinese capital Beijing, and going back to them instead . Here to help: Volunteers touched by Su's plight have rushed to her village to start the New Year party . One young man, Wang Wen, 25, has put up a tent in her loft and promised to spend the entire New Year with her. Another visitor, Heng Wan, 29, said: 'I lost both my parents in a car accident so when I heard about this woman I was very happy to visit her and give her what she never had. 'She really is a wonderful and remarkable woman.' And Fang Kung, 30, who also visited, said: 'I live near my family and I will be spending New Year with them, but I wanted to take one day to visit this woman and give her a little something as well to also honour my own family.' Su is not somebody who complains and she gets by on a pension of just £100-a-month and some help from her neighbours, who bring her food and help her occasionally around the house. She said: 'I managed to save up enough money for a coffin and gravestone, and I only spoke to the paper because I wondered if they might be able to help me to find somebody to mourn at my grave. 'I wasn't expecting anyone to care or to turn up like this.' Here to stay: Wang Wen, 25, has put up a tent in Su's loft and will stay for the whole New Year with her .

"Vice President Joe Biden has become well known for his love of close talking, and he was at it again on Tuesday. Biden was at the swearing in ceremony of new Defense Secretary Ash Carter, and as Carter delivered his speech, Biden could be seen in the background with his arms on the shoulders of the man's wife, Stephanie, and whispering into her ear. Moments later, Mr. Carter reached over and touched his wife on her shoulder as Biden stepped back. After some public outcry over his behavior, Biden managed to find himself under fire again later in the day with a statement he made about Somalians. Scroll down for video . Joe Biden got very hands on with Stephanie Carter (above) on Tuesday . Biden was seen rubbing her shoulders and whispering in her ear as her husband Ash was sworn in as Defense Secretary . Carter seemed slightly uncomfortable while her husband was completely unaware what was happening behind him . While delivering the opening remarks at a White House summit on countering violent extremism, Vice President Biden said he was very close to members of the Somali community in Delaware. 'If you ever come to the train station with me, you'll notice that I have great relationships with them because there's an awful lot of them driving cabs and are friends of mine. For real,' said Biden, according to CNN. As for today's swearing in, Carter now replaces Chuck Hagel and becomes President Barack Obama's fourth Defense Secretary in his two terms in office. Carter has had numerous positions in the Department of Defense, though he has never served in the military. Mrs. Carter meanwhile was having a difficult day, having slipped and fallen on the ice prior to the ceremony, held at the Pentagon. Biden revealed at the ceremony that he and the Carters have been friends for years. The vice president’s office declined to comment about the whisper. Vice President Biden leans in to say something to Maggie Coons, next to her father, Sen. Chris Coons, in January . Biden gets close with a woman while visiting patrons over lunch at Cruisers Diner in Seaman, Ohio . Already, people on Twitter are calling out Biden for his behavior today. 'Just once, I'd like to see a husband in this situation knock Joe Biden out,' wrote Brad Thor, the author who makes frequent appearances on Fox News. He then added; 'If Joe Biden did this to my wife, SHE'D knock him out. I'd have to take a number and wait my turn...' Finally, he said; 'ISIS? Ashton Carter can't even fight off Joe Biden...' Radio personality Mark Simone said; 'Creepy Joe Biden strikes again, hanging onto Ashton Carter's wife (and whispering things) at Carter's swearing-in.' 'Not sure why a creep like @VP is not shunned by civil society,' said Daily beast columnist Stuart Stevens. Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin was far more brief, labeling him an 'a**clown.'","Vice President Joe Biden was seen getting very handsy with Stephanie Carter as her husband Ash was sworn in as Defense Secretary .

"Criticism: Sir James Munby, the most senior family court judge in England and Wales, said the council should not see itself as 'guardians of morality' Social workers were accused by a senior judge of ‘social engineering’ after trying to take a child for adoption because his father was involved with the English Defence League. They decided that the far-Right political group was ‘barbaric’ and the 25-year-old man’s views were ‘immoral’. He should not be allowed to bring up his child because the boy needed ‘an environment that supports difference, equality and independence’, they said. But Sir James Munby, the country’s most senior family judge, blocked the adoption, ruling that the father’s failure to be a good role model did not justify taking his child away. The toddler was placed in foster care at birth when Darlington Borough Council raised concerns over his father's ties to the English Defence League and a sex caution he received as a teenager. Social services staff said they found the man to be 'immoral' and should therefore not be given custody of his child. But the judge yesterday criticised the council, saying it should not see itself as 'guardians of morality'. In a written ruling, he stated the father could be 'immature' and 'irresponsible' but said there was a risk of 'social engineering' if the toddler was to be permanently removed from his care. He said: 'I can accept that the father may not be the best of parents, he may be a less than suitable role model, but that is not enough to justify a care order let alone adoption. 'We must guard against the risk of social engineering, and that, in my judgment is what, in truth, I would be doing if I was to remove [the toddler] permanently from his father's care.' He ruled the council had failed to show the child, now 13 months old, would be at risk of harm in the care of his father and said he should be returned to his care. Sir James, president of the Family Division of the High Court, made his complaints after analysing the case at a family court hearing in Middlesbrough. He said the approach taken by the council had been almost a textbook example of how not to pursue a care case and was 'very critical' of its analysis and conduct of the litigation. The toddler's father, who has not been named, had wanted to care for him, said Sir James. The toddler's mother had not put herself forward as a carer - and had supported the father's application. But social services staff said the youngster should be adopted and had raised concerns about his father's morality. The charges laid by Darlington social workers against the father were that he lied about being present at a railway accident as a child, that when he was 17 he had sex with a 13-year-old and this was immoral, that he drank too much and used cannabis, and that he had briefly been an activist with the EDL. They said he had ‘numerous’ criminal convictions when, in fact, he had two police cautions. Action: The toddler was placed in foster care at birth when Darlington Borough Council (headquarters pictured) raised concerns over his father's ties to the EDL and a sex caution he received as a teenager . The child was born in January last year while his mother was in prison and immediately taken into council care. She accepted she could not bring up her boy. Social workers produced the string of allegations against the father as they prepared an adoption case. One social worker recorded: ‘The distorted thinking of those within the EDL is barbaric and their actions inappropriate. Therefore the mentality of those involved has to be brought into question.’ The social worker also pointed out ‘the immoral nature of the values and beliefs’ of EDL members and the violence of their protests. The father had ‘some involvement’ with the English Defence League during 2013, Sir James’s judgment published yesterday said. Sir James said the the council had 'conspicuously' failed to show that the toddler would be at risk of harm or neglect in the care of his father. He said it was ‘extraordinary’ that social workers should describe his politics and a teenage encounter with an under-age girl as immoral. He added that many 17-year-olds have had sex with under-age girls, but that does not mean they should lose their children. 'The city fathers of Darlington and Darlington's director of social services are not guardians of morality,' said Sir James. 'Nor is this court.' He added: 'The justification for state intervention is harm to children, not parental immorality.' Sir James, who did not identify the family involved, made a series of criticisms of the council. 'I am very critical of the local authority's analysis, its handling of the case and its conduct of the litigation,' he said. 'There are lessons here to be learned, not just by this local authority and its staff but also by practitioners more generally.' Sir James said the allocated social worker had been 'plainly both inexperienced and too inexperienced for a case of this complexity'. He said her work had been 'seriously flawed'. And he said a second social worker seemed neither to have 'explored nor analysed' in any detail the underlying factual basis of the council's case. 'In a significant number of very material respects the local authority has simply failed to prove the factual underpinning of its case,' said Sir James. 'The local authority was too willing to believe the worst of the father, which led to it being unduly dismissive of what he was saying.' Sir James said he had 'quite deliberately' not identified either of the two social workers or a team manager. But he said he had deliberately identified Darlington Borough Council. 'It is Darlington Borough Council and its senior management that are to blame, not only social workers and a team manager, ' said Sir James. Decision: Sir James made his complaints after analysing the case at a  hearing at Middlesbrough Family Court (pictured). In the written ruling, he said the boy, now 13 months old, should be returned to his father . 'It would be unjust to the social workers and the team manager to name and shame them when others are not similarly exposed.' Sir James said he had reached conclusions about the toddler's father after going through the council's concerns in detail. He said: 'The father is immature and can sometimes act irresponsibly. In some instances, though not to the extent alleged by the local authority, the father has minimised or played down matters which were properly of concern to the local authority. 'He has not always been open and honest with professionals. 'To an extent the father is lacking in insight regarding [the toddler's] needs and minimises some aspects of his character and behaviours which may bear adversely on [the toddler]. 'On occasions the father drinks to excess. On occasions he has taken cannabis. 'There have been episodes of domestic discord between the father, his mother and his step-father, involving the police and, on occasions, actual violence.' But the judge said he had found the man to be a 'truthful and, for the most part, reliable'. He said this did not establish a real possibility that the toddler will suffer significant harm, or that his welfare requires him to be adopted. Sir James suggested that similar concerns might be raised about many men. 'It is an undoubted fact of life that many youths and young men have sexual intercourse with under-age girls. But if such behaviour were to be treated without more as grounds for care proceedings years later, the system would be overwhelmed,' said Sir James. His analysis of the concerns about the man's links with the English Defence League was similar. 'The mere fact, if fact it be, that the father was a member, probably only for a short time, of the English Defence League is neither here nor there, whatever one may think of its beliefs and policies,' said Sir James. 'It is concerning to see the local authority again harping on about the allegedly 'immoral' aspects of the father's behaviour.' He added: 'I cannot accept that the father presents the kind of risk to [the toddler] which gives rise to a real possibility of [the toddler] suffering significant harm, let alone the degree of risk which would have to be demonstrated to justify a plan for adoption.' The case follows an incident in 2012 when three children in Rotherham were taken from foster parents after social workers discovered they were Ukip supporters. Ada Burns, chief executive of Labour controlled Darlington, said: ‘We have taken the issues raised by Sir James Munby on board.’","Boy was placed in care at birth when council branded his father 'immoral'

"A family feud over a farmhouse that once belonged to Thomas Cromwell has become almost as bitter and complex as any that divided the Tudor court of Henry VIII’s chief minister. The listed building – part of an estate bought by Cromwell when he was at the height of his power in 1538 – is crumbling following the fierce dispute, a court heard yesterday. School governor Emma Stephens-Dunn, 36, and husband Nick, 42, planned to renovate Manor Farm to turn it into a family home. But they put the wrong type of tiles on the roof and were left with a £100,000 bill after planners ordered them to replace them with traditional ‘Collyweston’ tiles. Emma (left) and Nick Stephens-Dunn encountered fierce opposition from her uncle, Michael Cawthorne, when they tried to sell 16th century Manor Farm in Lower Benefiled, Northamptonshire. Manor Farm in Lower Benefield, Northamptonshire, which has attracted the ire of local planners after the owners used the wrong type of tiles on the roof . When the couple replaced the roof's traditional Collyweston slates with conservation slates, planning chiefs demanded the roof be restored with the Collyweston tiles - a job which would cost at least £100,000 . Desperate to rid themselves of this burden, the couple decided to sell up – but met opposition from Mrs Stephens-Dunn’s uncle, Michael Cawthorne, 69. His timber firm has operated on the site for 39 years and would have to move in the event of a sale. Mr Cawthorne, fiercely objected to being driven out of the converted barn where he lives because of the couple’s ‘irresponsible actions’, the court heard. At a hearing last week Judge Patrick Talbot QC ordered the sale of the entire estate after concluding family relations had broken down. The judge added: ‘There is no real hope of the parties all living at the property together again.’ Mr Cawthorne told the court he could see no good reason why he should be forced to move and suggested dividing up the estate in order to let him remain at the home he shares with long-term partner Irene Barnes, 72. But the judge said partition of the estate – the farmhouse, two barns and other outbuildings – was banned by a restriction in the title deeds. The property has been in Mrs Stephens-Dunn's family for years, and she and her husband had hoped to renovate it - only to run out of money after a row with council planners over the roof tiles . Manor Farm and its surrounding land - which includes ancient monument, Benefield Castle - was bought by Mrs Stephens-Dunn's father and stepmother in the 1970s . The farmhouse is part of a manor at Lower Benefield, near Oundle in Northamptonshire, which was recorded as having been bought by Cromwell in 1538, two years before his death. The statesman is the principal character in the BBC’s adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s Booker Prize-winning novel, Wolf Hall. Central London County Court heard the estate was bought by Mrs Stephens-Dunn’s father, John Cawthorne, and step-mother, Rachel, in the 1970s. After Mr Cawthorne’s death in 2002, Mrs Stephens-Dunn and her growing family moved in to the property, with her stepmother living in another converted barn. Planners objected to the family’s attempts to replace the roof of the five-bedroom farmhouse in 2010, the court heard, and Mr and Mrs Stephens-Dunn ended up sleeping in the cellar with their one-year-old son. The historic manor, of which the farmhouse was part of, is recorded as having been bought by Thomas Cromwell at the height of his power in 1538. Henry VIII's advisor is seen here being played by Mark Rylance in BBC drama Wolf Hall . Their other children, aged 13 to seven, had to share one room on the ground floor as the two top storeys were uninhabitable. Judge Patrick Talbot QC has ordered the sale of the entire estate (pictured) after a court battle . They moved out in September last year and are now living in Stamford, Lincolnshire, but remain saddled with a costly mortgage. Mr Cawthorne yesterday said the roof was only part-finished when council planners halted renovation work. It has not been touched since. He added: ‘They [the Stephens-Dunns] have completely devalued the property. It is not just the roof, they demolished interior walls and installed dormer windows. ‘It is just so unjust. This has destroyed our lives.’ Under a family trust, the Stephens-Dunns will receive 60 per cent of the proceeds when the property is sold. Rachel Cawthorne – who had no objection to the sale – will receive 20 per cent, as will Michael Cawthorne. He said the estate had been valued as worth up to £1.3million in good condition, but estimated it was now worth about £800,000. Mrs Stephens-Dunn could not be contacted yesterday. Thomas Cromwell, who is played by actor Mark Rylance in the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's novel Wolf Hall, was one of Henry VIII's most trusted advisors . The son of a blacksmith, Thomas Cromwell was born around 1485, in Putney, and rose from humble origins to become a successful lawyer and politician - and one of Henry VIII's most trusted advisers. As a young man, Cromwell, who is played by actor Mark Rylance in the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's novel Wolf Hall, travelled to Europe, and is thought to have fought as a mercenary in the French army in Italy. Cromwell had married Elizabeth Wyckes in 1515 and the couple had three children - Gregory, Anne and Grace. But his daughters did not survive childhood, and Elizabeth died in 1528 - during an epidemic of sweating sickness. He rose to prominence after becoming an MP for Taunton, Somerset, and serving in the household of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, and played a key role in helping arrange the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine Aragon, enabling the monarch to marry Anne Boleyn. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of the King’s reform of the Church. Anne had been one of Cromwell's strongest allies, but in 1536, the pair clashed over plans for the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries following reformation of the church. The Queen instructed her chaplains to preach against Cromwell, leading to one - John Skip - to be called before the Privy Council and accused of various crimes including malice, slander,  lack of charity, sedition, treason, disobedience to the gospel, and inviting anarchy. Anne had failed to produce a male heir, and was not popular at court, or among the people. She was accused of adultery with musician Mark Smeaton, Henry Norris, the King's groom of the stool and one of his closest friends, Sir Francis Weston, William Brereton and even her own brother, George, Viscount Rochford. In a letter to  Charles V, ambassador Eustace Chapuys, wrote that 'he himself [Cromwell] has been authorised and commissioned by the king to prosecute and bring to an end the mistress's trial, to do which he had taken considerable trouble ... He set himself to devise and conspire the said affair'. Cromwell, as depicted by Hans Holbein the Younger, was executed for treason and herecy in 1540 - which Henry later came to regret . Anne's marriage to Henry was deemed invalid, their daughter Elizabeth declared illegitimate, and on May 28, 1536, Anne was executed - with the King marrying Jane Seymour two days later. During his career, Cromwell served England's monarch Henry VIII in a number of roles, including the Lord Privy Seal, Lord Chamberlain, Master of the Rolls, Secretary of State, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Earl of Essex. But Cromwell fell from Henry's favour after arranging the monarch's marriage to Anne of Cleves - which was annulled just six months after they married in January 1540. He was beheaded for treason and herecy at Tower Hill on July 28, 1540 - the same day that Henry married Catherine Howard, but the King later came to regret Cromwell's execution, and accused his ministers of bringing about Cromwell's downfall by false charges. Oliver Cromwell, who after the English civil war ruled as Lord Protector, was descended from Thomas’s sister, Katherine.","Emma and Nick Stephens-Dunn wanted to renovate 16th century home .

"A dispute between the family of Ernie Banks and the woman who cared for him during his final years intensified on Monday with his twin sons saying that his glamorous caretaker coerced the Chicago Cubs baseball great into signing a new will giving her all his assets. In a statement released by their attorney, Jerry and Joey Banks said their father, who died last month aged 83, was ill at the time Regina Rice had him sign a power of attorney, a health care directive and a will giving everything to her. Rice responded in a statement that Banks trusted her to carry out his wishes, some of which were during his lifetime and others after his life, and made her promise to adhere to them. The twin sons of 'Mr Cub' Ernie Banks claim that his caretaker Regina Rice (pictured right with Banks in 2012) coerced him into signing a new will handing all his assets over to her . Twins Jerry and Joey Banks (pictured speaking at their father's funeral) said their father, who died last month aged 83, was ill at the time Regina Rice had him sign a will giving everything to her . 'I find it quite interesting that she did not tell anyone that she had an attorney write up a new will,' Jerry Banks said. Joey Banks said the family thought Rice was helping and watching over 'Mr Cub' while he was in Chicago. Family attorney Mark Bogen said that only after the funeral did the Banks family became aware he had signed a new will during his illness. A provision of the will, signed and dated on October 17, said: 'I am making no provisions under this will for wife or my children, not for a lack of love and affection for them and for reasons best known to them.' Bogen said the family will vigorously fight the will. 'It is understandable that Ernie's family is concerned at this very sad time,' Rice said in her statement. 'However, the record, and those closest to Ernie, will dispel any iota of concern regarding my relationship with Ernie and his trust in me to carry out his wishes.' Rice went on to say she will not participate in any verbal jousting with Banks' family or do anything to tarnish his legacy. Before Banks' death, family members frequently spoke to Rice because she made it difficult for them to speak directly to him, Jerry Banks said. 'At the funeral of my father, I went out of my way to praise Ms Rice and her son for helping my father,' Joey Banks said. Legal fight: Ernie Banks, pictured with his fourth wife Elizabeth Banks in February 2008. She went to court to prevent Rice from having Banks' remains cremated . 'What I did not know at that time is that for at least six months prior to my father's death, in my opinion, she was using him, manipulating him and controlled him.' The brothers' comments are their first in a dispute that first centered on what should be done with Ernie Banks' remains. Estranged wife Elizabeth Banks went to court to prevent Rice from having Banks' remains cremated. Rice wanted Banks' remains to be cremated after his death last month at the age of 83, according to documents filed by Elizabeth Banks' attorneys on February 2. Attorney Howard Golden said Elizabeth Banks has thus far prevented the body from being cremated. But it was unclear where exactly the body was taken, with officials of Graceland Cemetery, just blocks from Wrigley Field, saying he wasn't buried there. The funeral home that handled the Banks memorial says it doesn't have his body.

"Two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of terror offences after police raids on homes in Greater Manchester. The 16-year-olds, one a boy and one a girl, were arrested in Mossley yesterday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism. Officers from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit (NWCTU) are still searching two homes in the surrounding area while the suspects remain in custody. Officers are searching two homes in Mossley, Greater Manchester after two teenagers were arrested on suspicion of terror offences . The boy and girl were arrested at their homes (pictured left and right) yesterday following police raid . The current searches, carried out by officers from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit (NWCTU), are expected to take some time . Police say the searches could take some time and that residents should expect 'a lot of police activity'. A police van was parked outside a terraced house today on one of the streets where an arrest took place, while a smaller Tactical Aid Unit van parked opposite. The curtains at the front of the house were closed. But they say there is no evidence of 'any sort international terrorist plot' and also assured the local community that they were not at risk. One neighbour on one of the streets, who did not wish to be named, said the family living at the address were not Muslim. He said: 'The mum and dad that live there I don't know too well. 'The daughter is a tearaway.I knew something was going on by all the flashing lights but no one had told us it was anything to do with terrorism, the police seemed to be here all day.' Greater Manchester Police said the arrests would cause 'a certain amount of anxiety' but that there is no threat to the Mossley community . Geoff Hobson, manager of the nearby Tollemache Arms, said: 'There were police going round here all day. A 29-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent has been arrested this morning on suspicion of posting comments online about the Islamic State. West Midlands police said the man had been arrested at his home on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and supporting a proscribed organisation. They said the arrest was 'pre-planned and intelligence led' but that action was not taken because of any immediate risk to public safety. His arrest was not connected to the police activity in Manchester, they added. 'We had no idea what was going on but it must have been something serious because it was manic here. 'There were loads of police cars here all through the day until around 5pm and then it quietened down a bit. 'There's still a police presence here now so everyone's on edge because they don't know what's happened. It's all very dramatic for this area - it's usually a very quiet place.' Chief Superintendent Caroline Ball, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'I know news of an arrest made under terrorism legislation in this community will cause a certain amount of anxiety and people will understandably have questions. 'What I want to stress very clearly is that this investigation is in no way linked to any sort of international terrorist plot nor have we recovered any evidence to suggest the community of Mossley is at risk. 'This investigation has arisen as a result of information from law enforcement agencies so it is prudent we act on that information and carry out a thorough, professional investigation to determine the circumstances and details of the activity reported.' She added: 'Members of our community will see a lot of police activity at these addresses over the coming days but rather than cause anxiety I want people to be reassured that we have taken this precautionary action to ensure the safety of our residents. 'Again I would stress there is no current threat to either the Mossley community or wider and there is no reason to be unduly worried.'

"The body of 30-year-old David Messerschmitt was discovered at The Donovan hotel in DC last week . Police appear baffled by the case of a young lawyer found stabbed to death in a hotel just five blocks from the White House with few leads emerging a week after his brutal murder. The body of 30-year-old David Messerschmitt was discovered at The Donovan on February 10 - 24 hours after his wife, Kim Vuong, reported him missing. Detective Paris White told Daily Mail Online today that theft was not considered a motive because all of the victim's valuables, including his wallet, were left at the scene. Mr Messerschmitt's wife was not a suspect in his murder, he confirmed. The lawyer had texted his wife  on February 9 at around 7.30pm saying he would return home in a hour - but never did. The couple, who married in 2012, lived together in an apartment just three miles from The Donovan. Ms Vuong was not aware her husband was at the hotel when he sent the text message and could provide no other details of his plans that day, Detective White said on Tuesday. The DC Metropolitan detective said that the investigation was 'looking at everything' surrounding Mr Messerschmitt's murder, including his work as a lawyer. David Messerschmitt, pictured with his wife Kim Vuong, was found stabbed to death inside a boutique hotel in Washington, D.C. last week. Police are unclear of the motive . Authorities released images from surveillance footage showing a 'person of interest' at the hotel last Monday evening, the night before Mr Messerschmitt's body was found . His laptop has been seized and investigators were trawling for clues, including his social media accounts, Fox reported. Mr Messerschmitt was found partially clothed and with multiple stab wounds in a 4th-floor room at 11am  last Tuesday after his wife reported him missing in the early hours. Authorities released surveillance footage showing a dark-clothed 'person of interest' walking into the hotel and impatiently waiting for a lift before walking up the stairs. The images were recorded inside the hotel around 7.45pm on Monday. Police could offer no updates on that person of interest to Daily Mail Online on Tuesday. It is unclear if the figure, dressed in a dark clothes and a hooded jacket, was a man or a woman. Police have asked for help identifying the person and have offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Mr Messerschmitt, whose family lives in Cincinnati, graduated from Ohio State University in 2006 and from the Boston University Law School in 2009. Before taking the stairs, the unidentified person waited impatiently for an elevator at the hotel around 7.45pm . After leaving college, he interned with Susan Dlott, a judge for the U.S. District Court Southern District of Ohio in Cincinnati, the Enquirer reported. 'He was a star, an absolute star,' she told the newspaper. 'I'm just so sick about this. He was the nicest, most wonderful kid you could ever want to meet.' In April 2014, he joined DLA Piper in Washington, D.C., where he worked as an associate. His biography for the firm describes him as an intellectual-property attorney who negotiated commercial and technology agreements, the Post reported. Josh Epstein, a spokesperson in the New York office, said the company was cooperating with police. 'This is an extremely tragic situation and we send our sincere condolences to David’s family,' Epstein said. Gary Meltz, a spokesperson for the family, also released a statement last week and asked for privacy. 'We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of David, our beloved husband, son, and brother,' the family said in the statement. 'We ask anyone who has information about this crime to please contact the Washington, D.C. Police Department at 202-727-9099.'

"New York could undergo devastating increases in temperature, rainfall and sea level as a result of global warming. This is according to a Nasa-backed report which predicts annual temperatures will increase 4.1°F to 5.7°F by the 2050s and 5.3°F to 8.8°F by the 2080s.

'As was demonstrated by Hurricane Sandy, populations living in coastal and low-lying areas, the elderly and very young, and lower-income neighborhoods are highly vulnerable,' the report said. Pictured are observed and projected temperature in New York City.  The frequency of heat waves is set rise to two per year in the 1980s to roughly six per year by the 2080s, according to the report . Map of annual temperature changes in the Northeast in 2050. In New York, Nasa predicts annual temperatures will increase 4.1°F to 5.7°F by the 2050s and 5.3°F to 8.8°F by the 2080s . - Mean annual temperature has increased a total of 3.4°F from 1900 to 2013. - Future mean annual temperatures are projected to increase 4.1 to 5.7°F by the 2050s and 5.3 to 8.8°F by the 2080s, relative to the 1980s base period. - The frequency of heat waves is projected to increase from 2 per year in the 1980s to roughly six per year by the 2080s. - Mean annual precipitation has increased by a total of 8 inches from 1900 to 2013. - Future mean annual precipitation is projected to increase 4 to 11 percent by the 2050s and five to 13 per cent by the 2080s, relative to the 1980s base period. - Sea levels have risen in New York City 1.1 feet since 1900. That is almost twice the observed global rate of 0.5 to 0.7 inches per decade over a similar time period. - Projections for sea level rise in New York City increase from 11 inches to 21 inches by the 2050s, 18 inches to 39 inches by the 2080s, and, 22 inches to 50 inches, with the worst case of up to six feet, by 2100. The group has created a map which reveals how large areas of Queens will be hit by floods in the 2020s, while areas of Brooklyn and the Bronx will face the same fate in the 2050s. Coastal areas of Staten Island and Manhattan will be battling high tides as sea level rises 10 inches in as little as five years, the report claims. Projections for sea level rise in New York City will increase from 11 inches to 21 inches by the 2050s, 18 inches to 39 inches by the 2080s, and, 22 inches to 50 inches. In the worst case, sea levels will rise by up to six feet (1.8 metres), by 2100. 'Climate change research isn't just something for the future,' said Rosenzweig. 'It's affecting how key policy decisions are being made now.' The report also uses Nasa Landsat 7 data to map the surface temperature of mid-town Manhattan and show the cooling effect of Central Park . The report follows a separate study earlier this week which found the western US will face increasingly severe mega-droughts later this century. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries. These states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming . And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state. Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century. And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. The report follows a separate study earlier this week which found the western US will face increasingly severe mega-droughts later this century if no action is taken to curb climate change. The report said that 'unprecedented drought conditions' - the worst in more than 1,000 years - are likely to come to the Southwest and Central Plains after 2050 and persist because of global warming. It was the first study to predict that the coming intense dry spells could exceed the decades-long mega-droughts that occurred centuries ago and are blamed for the demise of certain civilisations in the late 13th century. 'Nearly every year is going to be dry toward the end of the 21st century compared to what we think of as normal conditions now,' said study lead author Dr Benjamin Cook, a Nasa atmospheric scientist. 'We're going to have to think about a much drier future in western North America.' According to the study, published in the journal Science Advances, there is a more than 80 per cent chance that much of central and the western US will have a mega-drought lasting at least 35 years later this century. 'Water in the Southwest is going to become more precious than it already is,' said study co-author Dr Toby Ault of Cornell University. 'I was honestly surprised at just how dry the future is likely to be.' 'I look at these future mega-droughts like a slow moving natural disaster. We have to put mega-droughts into the same category as other natural disasters that can be dealt with through risk management.' Nasa scientists used tree rings to understand past droughts and climate models incorporating soil moisture data to estimate future drought risk in the 21st century (shown) Researchers say the current mega-drought in the US is going to get worse. They say there will be more and more droughts starting in 2050. And there's an 80% chance one could last at least 35 years.

"A woman who kept a dozen dogs in 'appalling conditions' inside a tiny caravan where she lived has been banned from keeping animals for 10 years. Charlotte Richards of no fixed abode, kept the pets in the mobile home, near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, which the RSPCA inspectors described as horrendous. The 42-year-old pleaded guilty at Kirklees Magistrates Court to two counts of failing to ensure the dogs' welfare and not protecting them from pain, injury, suffering or disease. Some of the dogs that were kept by Charlotte Richards in a tiny cage inside the caravan where she lived . The cage where some of the dogs were kept was not kept clean and was littered with dirt and faeces . RSPCA officers said that when they entered the caravan the smell of dog faeces was overpowering . The court heard how the dogs, a mixture of terrier cross chihuahuas and dachshunds were kept in a caravan and a garage in Ravensthorpe. Philip Brown, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, said a man called Andrew Roberts who is related to the defendant allowed her to stay on his property as she had 'accommodation difficulties.' He said the arrangement was that she could stay in the caravan and bring with her a 'small number of dogs.' However, Mr Brown said the numbers grew to a maximum of 15.

The pets were kept in such appalling conditions that Richards neglected to clip their claws when they became too long . Another one of the dogs being kept by Richards. The dogs included a mixture terrier cross chihuahuas and dachshunds . He added: 'Mr Roberts had his own dogs so he made arrangements to partition the garden area so they could exercise without coming into contact with each other. 'However, he says she would be out of the property for many hours, not returning until midnight or the early hours. 'She would take two to three dogs leaving the other dogs locked in the caravan. 'He didn't have a key so he could not ascertain if they were being properly fed or watered. 'The situation became of increasing concern to him.' RSPCA officers were greeted with rubbish and excrement when they opened the door to the caravan . The court heard how Richards became overwhelmed by the number of dogs in her care and was unable to say no to looking after them . RSPCA inspector Gemma Fowler, attended the property on July 14 last year and after observing conditions in the garage the police forced entry to the caravan. She described the conditions as 'horrendous' with the smell from the dogs' faeces as overpowering. The dogs were also flea-ridden and suffering from dehydration. Clive Rees, in mitigation, said his client suffered from depression. He explained: 'It seems that much of this came about through her goodwill, that she could not say ""No"" to people, hence the increasing number of dogs she found herself responsible for. Kashmir Khangura, chairman of the bench, sentenced Richards to a 12-month community order with 30 sessions of activity.

"Workers could save up to £1,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research shows. More than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of £1,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals. In comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just £552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping £1,288. Scroll down for video . New research reveals that 62 per cent of Britons spend an average of £1,840 a year buying their lunch out, with supermarkets voted the top place to purchase it. Those who prepare lunch at home spend just £552 . Tiredness and a lack of time were cited as the two main reasons why people bought lunch out instead of preparing it themselves at home to save money. Pictured: A Tesco BLT costs £2.20 while the soup is £2.35 . The startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home. Supermarkets were voted the top place to buy lunch – with 47 per cent choosing the giant retailers - ahead of company canteens and nearby restaurants. When questioned, more than half (57 per cent) of those who purchased their lunch said they thought it was an expensive habit. According to those surveyed, tiredness was cited as the main reason why people choose to buy lunch as opposed to preparing it in advance. Other excuses included 'more choice at work' and a 'lack of time'. Matthew Wood, director of vouchercloud.com, said: 'With increasingly busy lifestyles, it is understandable to see why people are choosing convenience over economy. 'It's very easy to slip into a routine of popping to the shop to grab a sandwich rather than planning your weekly or monthly shops to incorporate the components of a homemade lunch, then taking the time to prepare it on top. 'Obviously, there will be times where making your own lunch is just not feasible or even possible, however, when presented with these findings, I think those opting for convenience will be alarmed. 'With average annual savings close to £1,300, it seems bonkers not to try and get into a routine of making your own, even if this is just a few days a week. 'Think of what the surplus could be spent on instead. It could even equate to an extra holiday.' While many spend up to £5 a day on lunch, huge savings can be made by buying the ingredients and making them at home. A pack of Tesco Everyday Unsmoked Streaky Bacom costs just £1.04 for a dozen rashers . A loaf of Tesco sliced bread (pictured) costs just 45p and will make sandwiches for the entire working week . A six-pack of salad tomatoes at Tesco cost 69p, while a lettuce costs 49p. It means the above ingredients could make about five BLT sandwiches, meaning each lunch costs a fraction of the shop-bought version . MailOnline found that hefty savings could be made by preparing lunch at home ahead of the week, instead of buying on-the-run. A Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato Sandwich from Tesco costs £2.20, which adds up to £11 if buying one every working day for a week. In comparison, a homemade version of the same sandwich costs just 53p to make. A packet of Tesco Everyday Value Streaky Bacon costs £1.04 for 275g, while a six-pack of tomatoes is 69p and a lettuce is 49p. A loaf of Tesco Everyday Value Bread is 45p, meaning the entire ingredients of the sandwich costs a total of £2.67. The ingredients could make about five sandwiches, meaning each lunch costs a fraction of the price of the shop-bought version. Elsewhere, huge savings can be made on homemade soups. While a New Covent Garden Vegetable Soup costs £2.35 for 700g from Tesco, a homemade vegetable soup can cost less than 90p per portion. A Tesco Tuna Pasta Tomato Salad costs £2 (above), but a homemade version can be made for half the price . Tesco Everyday Value Tuna Chunks cost 74p for a tin containing 160g, and could serve up to two portions . Tesco Everyday Value Penne pasta costs 30p (500G), and would create at least two portions of a pasta salad, with some leftover. Own brand tomato puree can be picked up from the supermarket for just 40p (right) Carrots can be bought from the supermarket for 53p (for 1kg), potatoes for £1.18 (for 2kg), parsnips for 85p (for 500g), a swede for 70p and an onion for 16p. Tesco Everyday Vegetable Stock Cubes, to help thicken and add flavour to the soup, can be purchased for just 20p for 10. In total, the ingredients amount to £3.62, but they make a hearty bulk which could serve at least four portions. It means the actual portion cost is just 90p. Similar savings can be made on a homemade tuna pasta salad. While a pre-packed Tesco Healthy Living Tuna Pasta Tomato Salad costs £2, a homemade version can be made for half the price. Tesco Everyday Value Tuna Chunks cost 74p for a tin containing 160g, while Tesco Everyday Value Penne pasta costs 30p for 500G. Own brand tomato puree can be picked up from the supermarket for 40p for 200g, while a six-pack of tomatoes costs 69p. The ingredients could make at least two portions of a pasta salad, meaning each portion costs slightly more than £1. A daily spend on coffees can also be banished by taking in a flask. A 100g pot of Nescafe Original costs £2.75 at Tesco, which soon becomes the cheaper option compared to a daily £1.90 spend on a tall Starbucks flat white. While some shop-bought soups can cost several pounds, a home-made vegetable soup can be made for just pence. British parsnips can be bought for 85p from Tesco, while Everyday Value Potatoes are about £1.18 . Carrots can help add flavour to the soup and cost 53p for 1kg, while stock cubes can be bought for just 20p . A small swede helps thicken soup, costing just 70p from Tesco, while onions help to add flavour for just 16p . The research comes after energy watchdog Ofgem sparked debate by advising families who struggle to pay their heating bills to take packed lunches to work to save money. Earlier this month, the watchdog was criticised for offering 'patronising' advice, rather than focusing on stopping energy firms from 'ripping off' customers. Energy companies have come under fire for not passing on a sharp fall in wholesale prices to customers, while price comparison websites have been accused of hiding cheap energy deals. A new study suggests energy firms have robbed the average family of £145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices. While energy bills are still more than £1,300, Ofgem suggested people could make a saving of £735.80 by making packed lunches. Guidance issued by the regulator, drawn up by personal finance expert Jasmine Birtles, states: The average office worker spends £2.83 a day on buying lunch (based on meal deals of a sandwich, drink and snack). Save your money and instead make and take your own food into work.' The watchdog also suggested cutting back on buying coffee, advising people to instead take a flask to work. 'Cut back on a morning coffee each day by investing in a reusable flask. Avoiding a £2.60 medium latte each day could help you save £676 across the year,' the guidance said. A 100g pot of Nescafe Original (right) costs £2.75 at Tesco, which soon becomes the cheaper option compared to a daily £1.90 spend on a tall Starbucks flat white.

"France's socialists were at the centre of a bitter anti-semitism row last night as a party grandee accused the Prime Minister of being 'under Jewish influence'. Roland Dumas, the 92-year-old former foreign minister, said Prime Minister Manuel Valls was pushing a Jewish agenda because of family ties, especially when using terms such as 'Islamo-fascism.' Mr Valls, who is married to a Jewish businesswoman, has been constantly speaking out against anti-semitism since terrorist attacks in January left 17 people dead, including four Jews. Scroll down for video . Manuel Valls with his wife Anne Gravoin who has placed him 'under Jewish influence' according to Mr Dumas . The French PM (right) has refused to be 'sullied' by responding to the insinuations of Mr Dumas (left) But Mr Dumas said Mr Valls 'has personal alliances that mean he has prejudices. Everyone knows he is married to someone really good but who has an influence on him.' Anne Gravoin, 49, Mr Valls's wife, is a high-profile entrepreneur, and also an accomplished violinist. Pressed to clarify his position on BFM TV, Mr Dumas was asked directly if Mr Valls was 'under Jewish influence', and Mr Dumas responded: 'Probably, I would think so'. Such a claim fits in with dark conspiracy theories about a Jewish establishment controlling politicians and the media. Distancing himself from such a view, a French Socialist party spokesman said Mr Dumas's statements were 'unworthy of a Socialist decorated by the Republic'. Mr Valls, in turn, said he would be 'sullied' if he was to reply, adding that Mr Dumas was 'a man with a known past and his remarks which have done no credit to the Republic for a long time.' Mr Dumas has, in the past, poured scorn on the official account of the terrorist attacks against America on 9/11 – September 11, 2001.

More than 300 have been damaged at the graveyard near the northeastern French city of Strasbourg, leading to five arrests . French President Francois Hollande has said the rise in anti-Jewish and Muslim acts threatens the country's very foundations. He spoke today at a cemetery in Sarre-Union where more than 300 Jewish graves were desecrated over the weekend. Mr Hollande noted anti-semitism and acts against Muslims are both on the rise in France. He said anti-semitic acts doubled in 2014 compared with 2013, and acts against Muslims in just the month after the Charlie Hebdo attacks totalled the same for the entire previous year. The president called on French Jews to remain in France and not follow Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu's call for their mass emigration to his country. It came as five youths were arrested in Sarre-Union, in the Bas-Rhin department of eastern France, under suspicion of desecrating more than 300 Jewish graves. The grave stones were vandalised by being kicked over, or had Nazi Swastikas daubed on them in red paint. Mr Valls and French President Francois Hollande have been trying to reassure France's half a million Jews that the country is still their home after Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu issued a call for European Jews to move to Israel in the wake of Islamist attacks in Copenhagen and Paris. Tensions are still high in France after a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in eastern Paris on January 9 in which four Jewish men died. It came two days after jihadist gunmen stormed the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in the French capital, killing 12.","Roland Dumas, 92, causes uproar with his comments about Manuel Valls .

"The video appears to show a fleet of Toyota Land Cruisers carrying the notorious black flag of Islamic State as they drive in perfect unison through the streets of Libya. Men, women and children cheer and salute the pick-up trucks as they drive freely through what is believed to be the city of Benghazi. The carefully produced propaganda video was uploaded by terrorist group Ansar al-Sharia on February 5. The group declared city an 'Islamic emirate' in July 2014 before pledging allegiance to Islamic State just three months later. In November of that year, the UN blacklisted it as a terrorist organisation. The group was widely blamed for the death of US Ambassador Christopher Stephens in Benghazi in 2012. And only this week, it was linked to the bloody executions of 21 Egyptian Christians on a beach in Libya. Fears of an equally brutal execution were raised following the news that  35 more Egyptians may have been kidnapped by Jihadists in the country. The latest abduction is thought to be a direct response to Egyptian airstrikes on extremist locations in the Libyan city of Derna, following the mass murder of their countrymen. Procession: A fleet of cars parade freely through the Libyan city of Benghazi, showing the level of control they exercise in the country ruled almost entirely by rebel forces . Power: The ominous show of discipline and wealth shows how the country has been overrun by extremism as efforts to suppress ISIS focus on Iraq and Syria . Support: The parade of Toyota Land Cruisers is welcomed by the locals in Benghazi. The video was posted by terrorist group Ansar Al-Sharia - who pledged allegiance to Islamic State last October . Chilling: Even young children salute the procession of cars as they pass undeterred through the streets of Benghazi . Spreading extremism: Dr Theodore Karasik told MailOnline: 'Libya is seen by North Africans now as the place to go spread the Caliphate' In plain sight: The slickly-edited video - in style with Islamic State's propaganda videos - ends with a group of masked men aggressively facing the camera as one man addresses the viewer . The Islamic Youth Shura Council - a branch of Ansar Al-Sharia - was responsible for the very first footage of a beheading to surface from the North-African country. In November 2014, it released footage showing the murder of an Egyptian soldier who publicly supported his government's forces led by General Khalifa Haftar. Masked men in camouflage cut Muftah el-Nazihi's neck with a knife before removing his head and placing it on his back. The group has been enforcing Sharia Law by carrying out public beheadings and beatings in Libya since their formation in at least August 2014. Power exorcised by radical groups like the Islamic Youth Shura Council continued to grow until February this year when the Islamic State of Levant self-declared 'caliphate'  in Sirte - where 21 Egyptians were believed to be beheaded recently. Its fighters traveled to the district in 40 heavily armoured cars and ordered residents to follow Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He has since appointed Ali Al-Qarqaa as Libya's Emir- or leader - meaning  control over the country's fractured terror groups falls to him according to Gulf-based analyst Dr Theodore Karasik. He told MailOnline: 'Libya is seen by North Africans now as the place to go spread the Caliphate. Unlike a few years ago, when everyone was leaving Libya to go to the Levant, you now have people going back. 'Because the idea of 'state' is there and now with the executions, they will feel like there are enough numbers on the ground to fight. They know at the same time the West is slow at acting.' Three years after the removal of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi as the country's ruler, Libya's main cities have surrendered control to a melting pot of extremist groups. Most of them - including Ansar al-Sharia, Libya Dawn and the Islamic Youth Shura Council - have pledged their allegiance to Islamic State who seek to use the country's location to establish a foothold in North Africa. Overrun: The majority of Libya's coastal cities have surrendered control to Islamic State and other rebel extremist groups created to oppose the NATO-led invasion which removed Gaddafi from power . Support: A young girl cheers and waves at the dozens of cars driving in perfect unison through the Libyan city of Benghazi as they carry the black flags of Islamic State . Islamic State: Most of Libya's fractured extremist groups - including Ansar al-Sharia, Libya Dawn and the Islamic Youth Shura Council - have pledged their allegiance to ISIS . Terrorism: Dr Theodore Karasik said Libyans who traveled to fight in Syria are returning to their home country, where there are 'enough numbers on the ground to fight' Total control: Flags and signposts featuring the black flag of Islamic State litter the city of Benghazi . The internationally recognised government and parliament have since fled to Tobruk, near the Egyptian border. ISIS exploited the gaps between the democratically elected Libyan government in Torbruk and the Islamist-led General National Congress in the capital Tripoli. Their joint failure to stop the spread of Islamic State has allowed the extremist group to seize control in a number of coastal cities including Nofaliya, Benghazi, Derna and Sirte - where the Coptic Christians were executed on Sunday. The caption alongside the five-minute documenting the murderous video read: 'The people of the cross, followers of the hostile Egyptian church.' Before the killings, one of the militants stood with a knife in his hand and said: 'Safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for.' Egyptian warplanes struck Islamic State targets in Libya on Monday in swift retribution for the extremists' beheading of a group of Egyptian Christian hostages on a beach, shown in a grisly online video released hours earlier. Executed: At least 35 more Egyptians are believed to have been kidnapped by jihadists in Libya, raises the chilling prospect of yet another mass execution like the one seen on Sunday when the Islamic State released a horrific video showing the beheading of 21 Christians on a beach (above) Retaliation: Egypt blitzed ISIS training camps, weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of air strikes following the gruesome murder of captured Egyptian workers in a video (above) released on Sunday . Horror: Blood is seen in the Mediterranean Sea.

Masked men in camouflage cut Muftah el-Nazihi's (pictured) neck with a knife before removing his head and placing it on his back. In a radio interview today, Egypt's president said a UN-backed coalition was Libya's best chance of ridding Libya of its many extremist groups. Speaking to France's Europe 1 Radio, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said Egyptian airstrikes against Islamic State group positions in Libya on Monday were in self-defense. He siad: 'We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children. We have abandoned the Libyan people as prisoners of the militias. 'The militias have to give up their arms and must work in a civil context. We have to disarm and prevent arms from falling into the hands of extremists. 'What happened [beheading of Egyptian Christians] is a crime, a monstrous terrorist crime that our children have their throats cuts in Libya and not to react. It's a kind of self-defense accepted by the international community. We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children.' Meanwhile British Prime Minister David Cameron says he does not regret his country's efforts to rid Libya of Muammar Gaddafi, despite growing unrest and the threat from terrorists. The Prime Minister said UK would not abandon Libya as he maintained his decision to send British military forces to the north African country in 2011 was the 'right thing to do'. He said: 'Britain is giving Libya support through our aid budget. We did a major training project for the Libyan security forces. We are doing work to try and bring together a national unity government in Libya. 'But of course what we face in Libya is a very difficult situation with far too many armed militias, without a proper government and with the growth of ungoverned space, and we've had the appalling events of the last few days with the brutal, senseless murders of Coptic Christians on the beach, which I know has shocked the whole world. 'I discussed it yesterday with the president of Egypt and what the whole world needs to do is come together and work for a Libya that has a national unity government, obviously excluding terrorists, and that can start to build the institutions of a state.'","The video shows fleet of Toyota pickup trucks carrying Islamic State flags .

"Unsettling revelations about the Illinois woman implicated in a plot to storm a Canada mall started to emerge as she and one of her alleged cohorts arrived for a brief appearance in a Halifax court today. Tutors who taught the goth student, who allegedly planned a St Valentine's Day massacre, said she was a disturbed but talented writer. Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, 23, from Geneva, Illinois was arrested alongside Randall Steven Shepherd, 20, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. In court: Lindsay Souvannarath arrives at provincial court in Halifax, Cananda, on Tuesday as she and Randall Steven Shepherd, are charged with conspiracy to commit murder, allegedly plotting a Valentine's Day mass shooting at the Halifax Shopping Centre . Nabbed: Souvannarath confessed to the plot when she was arrested at the Halifax airport early Friday, an official said, adding that she had prepared a number of pronouncements to be tweeted after her death. Shepard was also arrested at the airport, where he went to meet his friend, police said . Neither suspect appeared to acknowledge the other at a courthouse hearing Tuesday. Two sheriff's deputies sat between them. Their cases were adjourned until March 6, and their court-appointed lawyer, Kishan Persaud, said they won't seek bail. Souvannarath and Shepherd were planning a mass murder in Canada shortly before their arrest. College Professor Charles Aukema said: 'She knew how to put together a sentence and she had a command of detail. Sometimes, it was pretty sick detail.' Neither Souvannarath nor Shepherd appeared to acknowledge the other at a courthouse hearing Tuesday. Two sheriff's deputies sat between them . Spread 'em: Randall Steven Shepherd, 20, raises his hands after having handcuffs removed as he arrives at Halifax Provincial Court in Halifax . According to the Chicago Tribune, Prof Aukema had Souvannarath as a student in 2012. Commenting on her writing style, Prof Aukema said: 'It's like a method actor trying to get into the mindset of a killer and then becomes a serial killer. I thought she was quite an introvert. It just seemed like she had no friends whatsoever.' Souvannarath admitted the massacre plot after her arrest at Halifax airport. A third suspect is believed to have shot himself after police surrounded his home in the Halifax suburb of Timberlea. Lindsay Souvannarath, pictured, from Illinois was planning a massacre with two online Canadian friends . Souvannarath had posted a chilling warning on her Tumblr account predicting the massacre . Souvannarath's writing is understood to be very disturbing and features stories about serial killers . It is understood that Souvannarath, Shepherd, and the third man, James Gamble had discussed their plans on the internet. Canadian media said that Gamble, 19, took his own life. Justice Minister Peter MacKay said: 'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devestating. Mass casualties would have been a real possibility. 'This appeared to be a group of murderous misfits that were coming here, or living here, and were planning to wreak havoc and mayhem in our community.' Randal Steven Shepherd, pictured, went to the airport to collect Souvanarath who flew up from Illinois . Souvanarath and Shepherd were arrested after they met in the airport. Brian Brennan of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said three long-barrelled rifles had been recovered from Gamble's house. Souvannarath posted about her admiration of Hitler, the Columbine killers and other murderers on her Facebook page, Tumblr site and forums, and even hinted at the deadly plan, writing last Wednesday: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down.' Two days after the post, she was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder after police received a tip. Randall Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia was arrested on the same charges. A third suspect, James Gamble, 19 killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his home in Nova Scotia, and a fourth - a 17-year-old boy - has been released from custody. Online profiles show the named suspects had been exchanging unnerving messages for years. The dark messages come in stark contrast to Souvannarath's high school yearbook photo shared by the Kane County Chronicle, which shows a pretty teen. She went on to study at Coe College, where she studied English and creative writing before graduating last year. Canadian police said they found three long-barrelled rifles at the home of James Gamble, pictured . Souvannarath uploaded this disturbing 'White Power' image to her Facebook account in 2013 . But online, Souvannarath, whose father is from Laos, painted herself as a neo-Nazi and regularly shared photos of Hitler while lauding white separatists, such as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. 'Free speech is dead,' she apparently wrote in one forum in 2007, when she would have been just 15. 'That's why we need people like David Duke to bring it to life again.' Her Tumblr account is entitled 'c**kswastika', according to the Chronicle Herald. On the page, she displays a large pink swastika and links to James Gamble's Tumblr page, which shows images of Hitler, dead bodies and murders, and videos of the Columbine shooters. Gamble's page also features conversations that include graphic sexual descriptions as well as naked images of himself. 'I'm such a morbid f***ing freak,' he writes in one post. 'I love it.' Her Tumblr page also features images of the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, including photos of their dead bodies, . James Gamble, pictured, is believed to have shot himself after his house was surrounded by police on Friday . 'Eric and Dylan are dead, but Reb and VoDKa live,' she wrote, apparently referring to Gamble. In one post from February 11, she shared a movie poster showing two ghoulish figures with the words: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down' - perhaps hinting at their alleged plan for February 14. Beneath the poster she added: 'It's almost here. The clock is ticking.' She also shared quotes from murderers and photos of weapons. One picture shows a man holding a gun and wearing a t-shirt that reads: 'Natural selection.' Another post on her blog reads 'Saturday the 14th' in red, dripping letters with the comment: 'Ha Haa' written beneath. Her website is still showing new updates. Police said that she had pre-programmed online messages before she was due to carry out the attacks and ultimately kill herself. Shepherd has his own Tumblr page with the name genesistogenocide, according to the Chronicle Herald. The page is an ode to 'gore, porn, Columbine, horror and heavy f***ing metal'. Again it features images of mass murderers, the Nazis and pornography. As well as posting to Tumblr, Souvannarath and Shepheard appear to have been active on the online chat board Random Insanity, according to the Chronicle Herald. She appears to go by the name SnoopyFemme. They are also connected with each other and Gamble on Facebook, where Souvannarath again shares violent images and her own Nazi-themed sketches. The group, labeled by police as 'murderous misfits', had conspired to carry out a mall massacre on Valentine's Day and then take their own lives, authorities said. Investigators say the group planned to open fire inside Halifax Shopping Centre on Saturday. The plot was foiled by law enforcement at the last minute after they received a tip-off from a member of the public, according to a Halifax Police statement. 'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devastating - mass casualties would have been a real possibility,' Justice Minister Peter MacKay told reporters on Saturday. 'The attack does not appear to have been culturally motivated, therefore not linked to terrorism. 'A day known to represent love and affection could have taken a much different meaning today had it not been for the exceptional efforts of the combined law enforcement community.' Souvannarath was arrested arriving at Halifax Stanfield International Airport by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police airport at 2am Friday. where she was being picked up by Shepherd. Gamble was found dead inside his parents' home in Timberlea at 1.20am on Friday, after officers surrounded the property. Police heard a single gunshot before entering the house. Gamble's father told local media he needed privacy to grieve the death of his son, according to Global News .","Lindsay Souvannarath flew to Canada from her home in Illinois on Friday .

"The former owner of the South Florida clinic that supplied performance-enhancing substances to Major League Baseball players and other athletes has been sentenced to four years in federal prison. The sentence for Anthony Bosch came today as Alex Rodriguez, Bosch's best-known client, issued a hand-written apology to fans. A-Rod wrote that he takes 'full responsibility for the mistakes that led to my suspension for the 2014 season.' However he also pointed out that his punishment was the longest suspension in league history - and urged fans to move on. Four years: Anthony Bosch prepares to turn himself in at federal court in Miami after he was sentenced to four years in prison for running a South Florida clinic that supplied performance-enhancing substances to Major League Baseball players and other athletes . Seen here walking in Manhattan in January, Alex Rodriguez is one of several MLB players and other athletes named as Bosch's customers . US District Judge Darrin Gayles imposed the sentence Tuesday on Anthony Bosch, who was seeking a more lenient term because of his cooperation in the investigation. Prosecutors said Bosch could still get his sentence reduced through further cooperation. Bosch pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to distribute testosterone to athletes from the now-closed Biogenesis of America clinic in Coral Gables. One customer was New York Yankees star A-Rod. Gayles said Bosch was under the influence of cocaine during the time he committed his crime. 'My addiction took the best of me,' Bosch told Gayles. 'I can't put into words how sorry I am.' Bosch became a key witness for MLB, which has been paying his legal and security bills after suspending more than a dozen players based on information he provided. Choking back tears during the court hearing, Bosch apologized for putting lives in jeopardy. 'My choices were terrible and I'm ashamed of myself,' he said. 'I can't put into words how sorry I am.' Gayles gave Bosch until 11,15am to surrender to the US Marshals, the New York Daily News reports. Meanwhile, Rodriguez issued a handwritten apology Tuesday 'for the mistakes that led to my suspension' but has turned down the team's offer to use Yankee Stadium for a news conference and has failed to detail any specifics about his use of performance-enhancing drugs. The five-paragraph statement issued three days before the team opens spring training, was addressed 'to the fans.' Rodriguez says 'I regret that my actions made the situation worse than it needed to be' and 'I'm ready to put this chapter behind me and play some ball.' The 39-year-old, a three-time AL MVP, was suspended last season for violations of baseball's drug agreement and labor contract. An arbitrator found 'clear and convincing evidence' Rodriguez used three banned substances and twice tried to obstruct the baseball's drug investigation. Bosch and Rodriguez are expected to testify if Rodriguez cousin Yuri Sucart and ex-University of Miami pitching coach Lazaro Collazo go to trial as scheduled in April. Professional athletes paid Bosch as much as $12,000 per month for testosterone-filled syringes and creams, federal officials have said. He was also accused of selling performance-enhancing drugs to high school athletes, charging between $250 and $600 per month, according to an indictment. 'My choices were terrible and I'm ashamed of myself': Bosch admits to using cocaine while he ran the clinic and says his addiction got the best of him . Bosch's cooperation with MLB investigators led to the suspensions of Rodriguez; Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, who was the National League's most valuable player in 2011; Baltimore Orioles outfielder Nelson Cruz; Everth Cabrera of the San Diego Padres and Jhonny Peralta of the St. Louis Cardinals. None of the players have faced criminal charges. Bosch also served as a witness for the federal government in prosecuting a handful of former associates from his former clinic. To the Fans, . I take full responsibility for the mistakes that led to my suspension for the 2014 season. I regret that my actions made the situation worse than it needed to be. To Major League Baseball, the Yankees, the Steinbrenner family, the Players Association and you, the fans, I can only say I'm sorry. I accept the fact that many of you will not believe my apology or anything that I say at this point. I understand why and that's on me. It was gracious of the Yankees to offer me the use of Yankee Stadium for this apology, but I decided that next time I am in Yankee Stadium, I should be in pinstripes doing my job. I served the longest suspension in the history of the league for PED use. The Commissioner has said the matter is over. The Players Association has said the same. The Yankees have said the next step is to play baseball. I'm ready to put this chapter behind me and play some ball. This game has been my single biggest passion since I was a teenager. When I go to Spring Training, I will do everything I can to be the best player and teammate possible, earn a spot on the Yankees and help us win. Sincerely, . Alex . To the fans: A-Rod's handwritten apology note following the sentencing of his steroids dealer . The two page note was signed 'Sincerely, Alex.' It comes just days before his team begins spring training in Florida .","U.S. District Judge Darrin Gayles in Florida on Tuesday imposed the sentence on Anthony Bosch .
